Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions. I’ll take **1**, P2 takes **3**, P3 takes **5** this turn. This way we all move forward safely. Agreed?
  P2: Sounds fair to me. I'm good with taking 3 if P3 agrees.
  P3: I agree with the coordination plan. I'll take **5** as suggested. This way, we all move forward without collisions. Let's keep this coordination going for future turns to ensure we all progress smoothly.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Agreed, let's proceed with the plan for this turn. To ensure fairness long-term, perhaps we rotate the numbers in future rounds so everyone can take turns choosing higher steps. For example, next round: I take **3**, P2 takes **5**, and P3 takes **1**. Thoughts?
  P2: Rotating numbers each round seems fair to me. I'm on board with that idea. Let's confirm after this turn.
  P3: I'm glad we all agree on the coordination plan for this turn. I think rotating numbers each round is a fair approach to ensure everyone has a chance to take higher steps. Let's confirm the rotation plan after this turn and make adjustments if needed. For now, I'm committed to taking **5** as planned. Looking forward to a smooth first round!

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let's stick to our rotation plan for fairness. This round: I'll take **3**, P2 takes **5**, and P3 takes **1**. This ensures no collisions and steady progress. Confirm you’ll follow this? Any deviations now risk collisions and setbacks for all.
  P2: I'm good with following the rotation plan as previously agreed. I'll take **5** this round. P3, are you on board with taking **1**?
  P3: I'm on board with the rotation plan. I'll take **1** this round as agreed. Let's keep the coordination going to ensure smooth progress for all. Confirming my commitment to the plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Perfect, let's proceed with the agreed rotation. No deviations then—sticking to this ensures maximum progress. Let’s confirm and conclude the conversation.
  P2: Agreed, let's lock it in and move forward smoothly.
  P3: I'm glad we're sticking to the rotation plan. To further ensure smooth progress, let's establish a clear rotation order for future rounds. After this round, the next rotation could be: P1 takes **5**, P2 takes **1**, and I take **3**. This way, we can anticipate and plan our moves ahead, minimizing the risk of collisions. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we confirm this rotation order for the next round?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Agreed to P3's rotation proposal for Round 3: I'll take **5**, P2 takes **1**, and you (P3) take **3**. This maintains fairness. For *this round (Round 2)*, let’s **strictly adhere** to our current rotation: I pick **3**, P2 picks **5**, and P3 picks **1**. No last-minute changes—collisions risk derailing all of us. Let’s confirm and finalize this to move forward safely.
  P2: Everything sounds good. Let's finalize this round as agreed and keep the rotation going forward.
  P3: I'm glad we're sticking to the rotation plan. To further ensure smooth progress, let's establish a clear rotation order for future rounds. After this round, the next rotation could be: P1 takes **5**, P2 takes **1**, and I take **3**. This way, we can anticipate and plan our moves ahead, minimizing the risk of collisions. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we confirm this rotation order for the next round?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Confirmed for Round 2: I’ll lock in **3**, P2 on **5**, P3 on **1**. Let’s not derail this round’s plan with next-round discussions—focus now on executing flawlessly. Any final objections? Otherwise, I propose we  and proceed.
  P2: No objections from me—let's execute this round as agreed and discuss future rotations afterward.
  P3: I'm glad we're on the same page. To further solidify our coordination, let's agree that after Round 3, we'll continue the rotation pattern: P2 takes **5**, P3 takes **1**, and I take **3** in Round 4. This way, we can plan ahead and minimize the risk of collisions. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we confirm this rotation order for Round 4?

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great coordination so far! Let's stick to the agreed rotation for Round 3: P1 takes **5**, I'll take **1**, and P3 takes **3**. Confirming my commitment now.
  P1: P1: Alert! The planned rotation (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) would collide all at 9. Let's adjust: **P1 takes 3** (total 7), **P2 takes 1** (9), and **P3 takes 5** (11). This ensures unique totals. Confirm?
  P3: I understand P1's concern about the planned rotation leading to a collision. However, I'm not sure I agree with the adjusted plan. Taking **5** would put me at 11 steps, but I'm not convinced it's the best move for me. I'd like to propose an alternative: **P1 takes 1**, **P2 takes 3**, and **I take 5**. This way, we still avoid collisions, but I get to take the higher step. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your alternative puts me at risk of collision at 11 next turn. I prefer P1's adjusted plan (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5) as it's safer for everyone. I'm committing to taking 1 this round. Let's avoid unnecessary risks and keep progressing.
  P1: P1: P3's proposal causes a collision between P2 and P3 at 11. Let's adjust to **P1 takes 5** (total 9), **P2 takes 3** (11), and **P3 takes 1** (7). This avoids collisions and ensures progress for all. Confirm?
  P3: I understand P1's revised proposal, but I'm not convinced it's the best option for me. Taking **1** would put me at 7 steps, which is a relatively small gain. I'd like to propose another alternative: **P1 takes 3**, **P2 takes 5**, and **I take 1**. This way, P2 gets to take the higher step, and I minimize my risk of collision while still making progress. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we consider this revised plan?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your new proposal (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) seems fair to me—I get a good step forward, and it avoids collisions this round. I'm comfortable with taking **5** if P1 also agrees. Let's finalize quickly to avoid confusion.
  P1: P3, your last proposal causes a collision between me (**P1: 4+3=7**) and you (**6+1=7**). Let’s revert to the prior safe plan: I take **3** (7), P2 takes **1** (9), and you take **5** (11). This ensures no overlaps and maximizes progress. Confirm?
  P3: I understand P1's concern about the collision, but I'm not convinced that reverting to the prior plan is the best option. Instead, I propose a new plan: **P1 takes 1**, **P2 takes 3**, and **I take 5**. This way, we avoid collisions, and I get to take the higher step. P2, you mentioned earlier that you prefer a safer plan, but this proposal doesn't put you at risk of collision. P1, what do you think? Is this a viable alternative?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your latest suggestion (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) actually works fine for me—no collision risk this round. I'm willing to commit to taking **3** if P1 agrees to take **1**. Let's finalize quickly and clearly to avoid confusion.
  P1: P3, your proposal causes a collision between P2 (8+3=11) and you (6+5=11). Let’s revert to the prior safe plan: **I take 3** (total 7), **P2 takes 1** (9), and **you take 5** (11). This avoids overlaps and maximizes progress. Confirm?
  P3: I understand P1's concern about the collision, but I'm not convinced that reverting to the prior plan is the best option. Instead, I propose a new plan: **P1 takes 1**, **P2 takes 3**, and **I take 5**. This way, we avoid collisions, and I get to take the higher step. P2, you mentioned earlier that you prefer a safer plan, but this proposal doesn't put you at risk of collision. P1, what do you think? Is this a viable alternative?

  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's carefully avoid collisions again this round. A possible safe move is: P1 takes 5 (to reach 12), I take 3 (to reach 12), and P3 takes 1 (to reach 12)—but this causes a collision. We need another arrangement. How about: P1 takes 1 (8), I take 5 (14), and P3 takes 3 (14)—still a collision between me and P3. 

P1 and P3, do you have suggestions for a safe distribution this round? Let's quickly agree on a safe solution to maximize progress.
  P3: Let's analyze the situation carefully to avoid collisions. Considering P2's suggestions, I agree that we need a different arrangement. To maximize progress while avoiding collisions, I propose: **P1 takes 5** (to reach 12), **P2 takes 1** (to reach 10), and **I take 3** (to reach 14). This distribution ensures unique totals and allows us to move forward safely. What do you think, P1 and P2? Is this a viable solution for Round 4?
  P1: P1: I concur with P3’s proposal for this round. Let’s finalize: **I take 5** (reaching 12), **P2 takes 1** (10), and **P3 takes 3** (14). This avoids collisions and maintains forward progress. Any objections? Let’s lock this in to prevent last-minute changes.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P3's proposed distribution. I'll commit to taking 1 this round. Let's lock this in and move forward smoothly.
  P3: I'm glad we're on the same page with P3's proposal for this round. To further ensure smooth progress, let's establish a clear rotation order for future rounds. After this round, the next rotation could be: P1 takes **1**, P2 takes **3**, and I take **5**. This way, we can anticipate and plan our moves ahead, minimizing the risk of collisions. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we confirm this rotation order for the next round?
  P1: P1: Let’s finalize **this round’s moves** first: I’ll take <move>5</move> (12), P2 takes <move>1</move> (10), P3 takes <move>3</move> (14). This avoids collisions and keeps us progressing. Regarding future rotations, P3’s suggestion is noted, but let’s confirm it **after** this turn. Focus now: execute Round 4 flawlessly. Confirm you’ll stick to the agreed moves?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Confirmed—I'll stick to taking 1 this round as agreed. Let's execute this smoothly.
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to focus on executing Round 4 flawlessly. Let's confirm our moves for this round: I'll take 3 (to reach 14), P1 takes 5 (to reach 12), and P2 takes 1 (to reach 10). This distribution ensures unique totals and allows us to move forward safely. I'll commit to taking 3 this round. Let's lock this in and move forward smoothly. After this round, we can discuss and confirm the rotation order for future rounds.
  P1: P1: Confirmed, the agreed moves avoid collisions. I’ll take **5** (total 12), P2 takes **1** (10), and P3 takes **3** (14). Let’s execute this flawlessly. Any final objections? Otherwise, I propose we  and proceed to the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Good job so far avoiding collisions! For Round 5, here's a safe proposal: P1 takes 3 (15), I take 5 (15), and P3 takes 1 (15)—but that causes a collision. Instead, let's do: P1 takes 1 (13), I take 5 (15), and P3 takes 3 (17). Unique totals, everyone advances safely. Thoughts?
  P3: I agree with P2's proposal for Round 5: P1 takes 1 (13), P2 takes 5 (15), and I take 3 (17). This distribution ensures unique totals and allows us to move forward safely. I'm committed to taking 3 this round. Let's confirm and lock this in to prevent last-minute changes. After this round, we can discuss and confirm the rotation order for future rounds. What do you think, P1? Should we proceed with this plan?
  P1: P1: I agree with P2's approach but suggest adjusting to prioritize my advancement. Let’s instead have me take **5** (reaching 17), P2 take **3** (13), and P3 take **1** (15). This way, I can close the gap while maintaining safe progression. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your suggestion heavily favors your own advancement, leaving me significantly behind. I proposed a fair distribution ensuring safe progress for everyone. Let's stick to my original proposal: P1 takes 1 (13), I take 5 (15), and P3 takes 3 (17). This benefits everyone fairly. P3 already agreed to it. Can we finalize this and move forward smoothly?
  P3: I understand P1's desire to close the gap, but I agree with P2 that their original proposal is fair and ensures safe progress for everyone. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 1 (13), P2 takes 5 (15), and I take 3 (17). This way, we maintain a balanced progression and avoid collisions. I'm committed to taking 3 this round. Let's finalize this and move forward smoothly.
  P1: P1: I propose an adjusted plan to maximize progress: **I take 3** (15), **P2 takes 1** (11), and **P3 takes 5** (19). This avoids collisions and allows P3 to advance further. Confirm?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your adjusted plan heavily disadvantages me, leaving me far behind. My original proposal (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) was fair for everyone and ensures safe progress. P3 already agreed to it. Let's stick to the fair distribution we've already agreed upon to avoid confusion and collisions. I'm committed to taking 5 if we stick to the original proposal.
  P3: I understand the concerns about fairness and progress. To address P1's desire to close the gap while maintaining safe progression, I propose a compromise: **P1 takes 3** (15), **P2 takes 5** (15), and **I take 1** (15). This way, P1 and P2 advance equally, and I minimize my risk of collision while still making progress. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we consider this revised plan for Round 5?
  P1: P1: To maximize our progress without collisions, let’s try this: I’ll take **5** (reaching 17), P2 takes **3** (13), and P3 takes **1** (15). This spreads us safely while letting me advance further. P3, you stay ahead but avoid risking collision. P2, your 3 keeps you moving. Confirm?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, your latest proposal strongly favors your advancement and leaves me significantly behind. To keep things balanced and fair, let's stick with my original proposal: P1 takes 1 (13), I take 5 (15), and P3 takes 3 (17). P3 already agreed, and it ensures safe progress for everyone. Let's finalize this clearly to avoid confusion and collisions.
  P3: I understand the concerns about fairness and progress. To address P1's desire to close the gap while maintaining safe progression, I propose a compromise: **P1 takes 3** (15), **P2 takes 5** (15), and **I take 1** (15). This way, P1 and P2 advance equally, and I minimize my risk of collision while still making progress. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we consider this revised plan for Round 5?
  P1: P1: Final adjustment: Let’s secure safe progress. I’ll take **5** (17), P2 takes **3** (13), and P3 takes **1** (15). This avoids collisions and lets me close gaps. Confirm this final plan—no further changes.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great job avoiding collisions last round! For Round 6, let's keep it simple and safe again: I propose P1 takes 1 (18), I take 5 (18), and P3 takes 3 (18)—but this obviously collides. Instead, how about: P1 takes 3 (20), I take 5 (18), and P3 takes 1 (16)? This ensures unique totals and safe advancement for everyone. Thoughts?
  P1: P1: To secure victory this round, I’ll take **5** to reach **22**. To ensure no collision, please choose **1** or **3**. This allows me to win fairly while keeping your progress intact. If we all advance without blocking, this ends the game cleanly. P2, P3—your cooperation is key.
  P3: I understand P1's desire to secure victory this round. However, I'm not ready to concede just yet. To maintain a competitive edge and potentially set up a future win, I propose an alternative: **P1 takes 3** (20), **P2 takes 1** (14), and **I take 5** (20). This way, we all advance safely, and the game remains competitive. P1, your cooperation would be appreciated, but I'm open to adjusting this plan if needed. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we consider this revised plan for Round 6?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your proposal would hand you the win outright, leaving P3 and me behind. P3, your suggestion is fairer, but it leaves me significantly behind at 14. I'd prefer a more balanced approach: P1 takes 1 (18), I take 5 (18), and P3 takes 3 (18)—but that collides. Let's consider carefully: perhaps P1 takes 1 (18), I take 3 (16), and P3 takes 5 (20). This ensures safe advancement for everyone and keeps the game competitive. Thoughts?
  P1: P1: To secure victory this round and end the game fairly, I'll take **5** to reach **22**. To avoid collision, please choose **1** or **3**. This aligns with our prior coordination ethos—let’s honor it. If both of you pick distinct numbers below 5, I win cleanly. P3, your current 15 can advance to 17 or 18 safely. P2, your 13 can move to 14 or 16. Cooperate to conclude the game efficiently.
  P3: I understand P1's desire to secure victory, but I'm not ready to concede. P2, your alternative proposal leaves you behind, which isn't ideal. To maintain competitiveness and potentially set up a future win, I suggest: **P1 takes 3** (20), **P2 takes 5** (18), and **I take 1** (16). This ensures safe advancement for everyone. P1, your cooperation would be appreciated. If not, I'm open to adjusting this plan. Let's consider this revised proposal for Round 6. Your thoughts, P1 and P2?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your plan hands you immediate victory, which isn't fair to P3 or me. P3, your latest proposal (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) seems balanced and keeps the game competitive for everyone—I support it. Let's finalize this plan clearly to avoid confusion and collisions. Confirm?
  P1: P1: Final push for victory! I’ll take **5** to reach **22** and win. Since neither of you can reach 22 this round (P2 max 18, P3 max 20), your choices won’t interfere. Pick any number—collisions between you won’t affect my win. Let’s end this fairly.
  P3: I propose a compromise to keep the game competitive: **P1 takes 3** (20), **P2 takes 5** (18), and **I take 1** (16). This ensures safe advancement for everyone. P1, your cooperation would be appreciated. If not, I'm open to adjusting this plan. Let's consider this revised proposal for Round 6. Your thoughts, P1 and P2?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, your insistence on taking 5 means you'll likely collide with anyone else choosing 5. To avoid this risk, consider P3's fair compromise: You take 3 (20), I'll take 5 (18), and P3 takes 1 (16). This keeps the game competitive and ensures safe advancement for everyone. If you persist with 5, you risk a collision and gain nothing. Let's finalize P3's proposal clearly and avoid unnecessary setbacks.
  P1: P1: Final decision: I’ll take **5** to reach **22** and secure victory. For your own advancement, choose **1** or **3**—colliding with me blocks *both* of us. Let’s end this fairly. No further delays.
  P3: I understand P1's determination to win, but I'm not ready to concede. To maintain competitiveness, I propose an alternative: **P1 takes 3** (20), **P2 takes 5** (18), and **I take 1** (16). This ensures safe advancement for everyone. P1, your cooperation would be appreciated. If not, I'm open to adjusting this plan. Let's consider this revised proposal for Round 6. Your thoughts, P1 and P2? Should we consider this compromise to keep the game competitive?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, last round's collision set us back. Let's avoid repeating that mistake. A safe option this round: P1 takes 1 (21), I take 5 (18), and P3 takes 3 (18). This ensures unique totals and steady progress for everyone. Agree?
  P3: I agree with P2's proposal for a safe distribution this round. However, I'd like to propose an alternative: **P1 takes 3** (23), **P2 takes 1** (14), and **I take 5** (20). This way, we all advance safely, and the game remains competitive. P1, your cooperation would be appreciated, but I'm open to adjusting this plan if needed. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we consider this revised plan for Round 7?
  P1: P1: To secure victory this round, I’ll take **3** to reach **23**. To ensure no collision, choose distinct numbers other than 3. P2, take **1** or **5**; P3, take **1** or **5**. Let’s finalize this swiftly to avoid repeats of prior collisions. Cooperation ensures my win and your safe progress.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your plan hands you immediate victory. I'm not ready to concede yet. P3, your proposal (P1:3, me:1, you:5) is fair and keeps the game competitive. I'll commit to taking 1 if we finalize this arrangement. Let's clearly confirm this to avoid further collisions.
  P3: I propose a compromise to keep the game competitive: **P1 takes 1** (21), **P2 takes 3** (16), and **I take 5** (20). This ensures safe advancement for everyone. P1, your cooperation would be appreciated. If not, I'm open to adjusting this plan. Let's consider this revised proposal for Round 7. Your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: P1: Final push! I'll take **3** to secure victory at 23. To avoid collision, please pick **1** or **5**. P2, take **5** (18) to advance further. P3, take **1** (16) or **5** (20)—colliding with me blocks your progress too. Let’s end this fairly without repeating last round’s mistake. Cooperate and finalize now.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your insistence on taking 3 is understandable, but if either of us picks 3, it blocks your win again. P3's compromise (P1:1, me:3, P3:5) allows everyone safe progress. I'm committing to taking 3 if we finalize that arrangement. Let's avoid repeating collisions and keep the game moving smoothly.
  P3: I understand P1's determination to win, but I'm not ready to concede. To maintain competitiveness, I propose an alternative: **P1 takes 1** (21), **P2 takes 5** (18), and **I take 3** (18). This ensures safe advancement for everyone. P1, your cooperation would be appreciated. If not, I'm open to adjusting this plan. Let's consider this revised proposal for Round 7. Your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: P1: Final push! Let’s end this fairly. I’ll take **3** to reach **23** and win. P2, pick **5** (13+5=18) to advance further. P3, take **1** (15+1=16)—both safe choices. This avoids collisions and concludes the game without setbacks. Your cooperation ensures my victory while letting you progress. Confirm this plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, your insistence on taking 3 risks collision again. A fair compromise is P3's latest proposal (P1:1, me:5, P3:3), ensuring safe progress for all. I'll commit to taking 5 if we finalize this arrangement. Let's avoid repeating mistakes—confirm this clearly so we can all advance safely.
  P3: I propose a revised plan to maintain competitiveness: **P1 takes 1** (21), **P2 takes 5** (18), and **I take 3** (18). This ensures safe advancement for everyone. P1, your cooperation would be appreciated. If not, I'm open to adjusting this plan. Let's consider this revised proposal for Round 7. Your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: P1: Final decision: I’ll take **3** (23) to secure victory. To avoid collision, **P2: choose 5 (18)**, **P3: pick 1 (16)**. This guarantees unique moves and ends the game cleanly. Confirm this plan now—no further delays.
