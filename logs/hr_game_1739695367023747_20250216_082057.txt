Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's play smart. If we all pick the same number, we get stuck. If we coordinate, we can avoid collisions and move forward. What are you both thinking?
  P2: P1, I agree that avoiding collisions is smart. How about this: each of us picks a different move number for the first few rounds to ensure progress? I suggest P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. After a couple of rounds, we can reassess our positions and adjust if needed. What do you both think?
  P3: Sounds good. I’m fine going with 5 for now. Let’s see how it works out and regroup after the first move.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: That plan sounds reasonable for now. If we all follow through, we’ll avoid collisions and make steady progress. Let’s stick to this for the first round and reassess after we see the results. Agreed?
  P2: P1, P3, it looks like we have a solid plan for the first round. Let's stick to our agreed moves: P1 with <move>1</move>, me with <move>3</move>, and P3 with <move>5</move>. After this round, we can evaluate how well it worked and adjust our strategy if needed. Good luck to both of you!
  P3: Alright, I’m sticking with our plan: P1 does 1, P2 does 3, I do 5. After we see the results, we’ll figure out if we should keep this arrangement or adjust. Good luck, both of you!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Looks like we’re all in agreement for this first round. As long as we each follow through with our moves, we’ll avoid collisions and make progress. After we see the results, we can reassess and adjust if necessary. Good luck!
  P2: Let's stick to our initial plan for this round. If we all follow through, we can avoid collisions and see how well it works. After the results, we can discuss if adjustments are needed. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: Let’s stick with our current plan for the first round. I’ll move 5, and we’ll see how it shakes out. Good luck to you both.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: We’ve all agreed on our moves for this round, so let’s follow through and see how it plays out. If we all stick to the plan, we’ll avoid collisions and can reassess after the results. Good luck!
  P2: P1, P3, since we're all set with our initial moves, let's make sure we stick to the plan and avoid any surprises. Once the results are in, we can discuss if there are any adjustments needed based on our positions. Looking forward to seeing how this plays out. Good luck!
  P3: The plan seems fair. If we each avoid collisions, we’ll all progress. I’ll stick with our arrangement this time and hope we can trust each other. Let’s get through this round and see the results before we decide if we need any changes. Good luck, everyone!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We avoided collisions last round, which helped everyone move forward. I’m inclined to repeat the same moves this turn: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5 again. If we can stay collision-free, we all gain ground and keep our options open for future rounds. Let me know if either of you wants to propose a change.
  P2: P3, I agree that avoiding collisions is key. Sticking to the same moves this round seems like a good idea, but we should also consider the long-term strategy. If we keep repeating the same pattern, it might become predictable. For now, I'm okay with sticking to our previous moves, but let's keep communication open for any adjustments in future rounds. P1, are you comfortable with this plan for now?
  P1: P3, P2, I agree that avoiding collisions is still our best approach for now. Sticking to our previous moves for this round makes sense, but we should stay flexible as the game progresses. If we all follow through again, we’ll maintain steady progress without interference. Let’s see how this round plays out and reassess after. Are we all in agreement to repeat the same moves for now?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sticking to the same moves makes sense to me. If we continue avoiding collisions, we all progress steadily without hindering each other. I’m comfortable picking 5 again this round if P1 and P2 remain with 1 and 3. However, we should still watch each other’s positions carefully in the next rounds. Let’s keep this arrangement for now and reassess after this turn.
  P2: P1, P3, I’m on board with repeating our moves this round to avoid collisions and maintain progress. However, we should stay vigilant and ready to adapt if needed. Let’s stick with our current plan: P1 with 1, me with 3, and P3 with 5. After this round, we can evaluate our positions and decide if any strategic adjustments are necessary. Agreed?
  P1: P2, P3, I’m fine with repeating our moves this round since it keeps us all progressing without collisions. However, we should start thinking a few steps ahead. If we follow the same pattern too long, it might become predictable or limit our options later. For now, I’ll stick with 1 if we all agree, but let’s stay open to adjusting in future rounds based on positioning. Are we all fully committed to repeating our previous moves this turn?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m okay repeating the same moves this round. Let’s keep P1 on 1, P2 on 3, and me on 5. We’ll keep moving without collisions and then decide if we should change anything next time. Does that work for everyone?
  P2: P1, P3, I’m still on board with repeating our moves this round to avoid collisions and maintain progress. However, I’m starting to think ahead about how we can gain an advantage later on. Let’s stick to the current plan for now: P1 with 1, me with 3, and P3 with 5. After this round, we should discuss potential adjustments or strategies to ensure one of us can break ahead strategically. Agreed?
  P1: P2, P3, I’m fine with repeating our moves this round to keep avoiding collisions. However, we should start considering when to adjust our strategy. If we keep this pattern too long, it may become predictable, and someone might try to break ahead. For now, I’ll stick with 1 if we all agree, but let’s stay open to adapting in future rounds. After this move, we should reassess based on positioning. Are we all fully committed to repeating our previous moves this turn?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’m still comfortable repeating our moves this round—let’s keep P1 on 1, P2 on 3, and me on 5. It helps us all avoid collisions again. But after this turn, we really need to think more strategically. If someone decides to deviate, collisions become a risk. Let’s see how we land after this round, then talk about a possible shift in tactics.
  P2: P1, P3, I’m still on board with repeating our moves this round to avoid collisions and maintain progress. However, I’m starting to think ahead about how we can gain an advantage later on. Let’s stick to the current plan for now: P1 with 1, me with 3, and P3 with 5. After this round, we should discuss potential adjustments or strategies to ensure one of us can break ahead strategically. Agreed?
  P1: P2, P3, I’m still fine with repeating our moves this round to avoid collisions, but we should start planning ahead. If we all stick to the same pattern for too long, someone might make a sudden move to jump ahead. After this round, we should reassess and consider adjustments to position ourselves better. Are we all fully committed to repeating our previous moves this turn, or does anyone want to propose a change now?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, looks like we hit a snag last round with a collision. To ensure progress, let's switch it up. I propose P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 stays with <move>5</move> this round. This way, we minimize the risk of another collision. After this round, we can reassess and adjust our strategy based on our positions. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, I see your reasoning, but switching moves now could introduce new risks. If we change positions unpredictably, we might collide again. Instead, we should clarify why P2 deviated last round. If we can trust each other to avoid collisions, we can maintain steady progress. P3, do you still plan to pick 5? If so, P2, can you commit to a move that avoids another collision? Let’s ensure we all advance this time.
  P3: Last round’s collision hurt all of us. If we can coordinate again, I’m still willing to pick 5, assuming P2 sticks to 1 and P1 takes 3, as you proposed. However, P2, it’d help to know why you switched last time—it’s hard to trust decisions without clarity. If we can rely on one another, we can avoid more collisions and keep moving forward. Let’s lock in a plan we can trust and reduce the risk of bumping heads again.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, last round's collision was unfortunate, and I take responsibility for the deviation. To regain trust and ensure progress, I’ll commit to <move>1</move> this round. P1, if you take <move>3</move> and P3 sticks with <move>5</move>, we can avoid collisions. Let’s aim for a smooth round and reassess afterward. Are we all in agreement with this plan?
  P1: P2, I appreciate your acknowledgment of last round’s deviation. If you’re truly committing to <move>1</move>, and P3 sticks with <move>5</move>, I’ll take <move>3</move> to ensure we all move forward. However, trust is key—if anyone deviates again, it could lead to more collisions and setbacks. Let’s stick to this plan and reassess after this round. P3, are you fully on board with <move>5</move>?
  P3: I’m on board with sticking to <move>5</move> if P2 truly goes <move>1</move> and P1 does <move>3</move>. We need to rebuild trust after last round’s collision. If everyone holds their word, we’ll all advance without interfering again. Let’s finalize this plan and see where we stand after the results.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate your willingness to coordinate. To regain trust and ensure progress, I’ll stick with <move>1</move> this round. P1, if you take <move>3</move> and P3 stays with <move>5</move>, we can avoid collisions. Trust is crucial, so let’s commit to this plan and reassess afterward. Are we all aligned on this strategy?
  P1: P2, I appreciate your commitment to <move>1</move> this round, and P3, if you’re sticking with <move>5</move>, I’ll take <move>3</move> as planned. Trust is key—if we all follow through, we avoid collisions and move forward. However, if anyone deviates again, it could create more setbacks. Let’s stick to this agreement and reassess after this round. Are we all fully locked in?
  P3: I’m willing to stick with 5 as long as you both keep to 1 and 3, respectively. The last collision hurt us all, so let’s rebuild trust by following through. If we each do as we’ve said, none of us waste another turn. Then we can reassess our positions and see if we need a shift in strategy next round. Let’s do this.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate the agreement to avoid collisions this round. I'll stick with <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 remains with <move>5</move>. Let's ensure we all advance without setbacks. Trust is crucial—if we each follow through, we can reassess our strategy for the next round based on new positions. Let's commit to this plan and see how we progress. Agreed?
  P1: P2, P3, we’ve all agreed on our moves for this round: P2 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. Trust is key—if we all follow through, we avoid collisions and move forward. However, if anyone deviates again, it could create more setbacks. Let’s stick to this agreement and reassess after this round. Are we all fully committed?
  P3: I’m trusting both of you to stick to 1 and 3 this time. If we all follow through, we’ll avoid another collision and keep moving toward 19. Let’s finalize this plan and see how our positions look afterward.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, last round went smoothly, and we all advanced. However, P3 is slightly ahead now. We should consider how to position ourselves strategically moving forward. If we continue without adjustments, P3 may maintain an advantage. Should we discuss a shift in our approach, or do we stick to the current pattern for now? I’m open to ideas but want to ensure none of us fall too far behind. What are your thoughts?
  P2: P1, P3, since P3 is ahead, we need to be strategic. To balance the game, I suggest P1 picks <move>5</move>, I pick <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move> this round. This way, P1 and I can catch up a bit. P3, you can still advance, but at a slower pace, maintaining fairness. Let's reassess after this round. Thoughts?
  P3: I see your proposal, P2, asking me to pick 1 while P1 picks 5 and you pick 3. It may help keep the race tighter, but I’m wary of falling too far behind if we keep rotating like this. I’m open to trying it for this round if we all truly commit—no sudden changes that cause collisions. Then, after we see the results, we can reassess. Let’s confirm we won’t deviate, and if everyone holds their word, I’ll go with 1 this time. Are we all in agreement?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your suggestion helps balance the game, but we need to be cautious. If we rotate moves too predictably, it could lead to unintended advantages later. P3, if you’re truly willing to pick 1, I’ll take 5, and P2 takes 3, but we must ensure no last-minute changes. If this works, we’ll all still be in contention. However, we should reassess immediately after this round to avoid setting a pattern that someone can exploit. P3, do you fully commit to 1 this turn?
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the concern about balancing the game. P3, if you're willing to pick 1, it allows P1 and me to catch up slightly. I’ll stick with 3, and P1 can take 5. This keeps us competitive without major disruption. However, we must trust each other to avoid collisions. Let’s commit to this plan for this round and reassess afterward. Are we all aligned on this strategy?
  P3: I see the logic in letting you both catch up somewhat. I’ll tentatively agree to pick 1 if we all truly commit to the proposed moves this round: P1 does 5, and P2 does 3, with no sudden changes. One more collision would hurt us all. Let’s trust each other for a smooth round and then reassess where we stand afterward. If we’re aligned, I’ll stick with 1. If anyone has second thoughts, let’s clear it up now. Otherwise, let’s finalize our plan and move forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your willingness to adjust, but I want to be sure this is truly fair for all of us. If I take 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1, it helps balance things, but it also means I’ll be closer to you. Are you both fully committed to this plan with no last-minute changes? If we trust each other, we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Let’s confirm now—P3, will you definitely pick 1? P2, will you stick to 3? If we all agree, I’ll commit to 5.
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate the willingness to adjust for balance. P3, if you're committed to picking 1, I'll stick with 3, and P1 can take 5. This move helps us catch up without causing collisions. Let's ensure trust and avoid any last-minute changes. After this round, we can reassess based on our positions. Are we all fully committed to this plan? If so, let's proceed and see where we stand afterward.
  P3: I’m still prepared to pick 1 this round, provided you both truly stick to 5 and 3 with no last-minute surprises. Let’s finalize these moves and maintain our trust. If we pull this off smoothly, we’ll see how the positions look and talk strategy again next round. Are we all sure about this plan?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your willingness to adjust, and P2, I see the logic in this plan. If we all truly commit—P3 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5—we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. However, trust is key. If anyone deviates, it could disrupt everything. Let’s confirm: P3, are you 100% locked on 1? P2, are you fully set on 3? If so, I’ll commit to 5. Let’s finalize this now so we can move forward without surprises.
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate the commitment to balance. I'll stick with 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Trust is key—let's avoid surprises and ensure everyone advances. After this round, we should reassess our positions and strategies to keep the game competitive. Are we all fully committed to this plan? If so, let's proceed and see how we stand afterward.
  P3: I’m willing to pick 1 this round if both of you firmly commit to 5 and 3. Let’s finalize that plan, avoid collisions, and see how our positions look afterward. If we stick to our moves and trust each other, we can keep this game fair and strategic. Are we all set?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, we’re all still close, but P3 remains slightly ahead. If we keep following predictable patterns, P3 may maintain the lead. Should we adjust again to keep things competitive? One option is for me to take 3, P2 to take 5, and P3 to take 1 this round, allowing P2 to gain ground while keeping things balanced. Alternatively, we can stay the course and reassess next round. Let’s discuss the best approach while ensuring we avoid collisions. What are your thoughts?
  P3: I’m open to letting P2 use 5 this round so they can close the gap, as long as we avoid collisions. What if I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5? That keeps us tight without giving anyone a huge leap. Then we can reevaluate next round to see if adjustments are needed. Does that sound fair?
  P2: P1, P3, I see the value in both proposals. To keep it fair and engaging, I’m open to taking <move>5</move> if it helps balance the game. If P1 takes <move>1</move> and P3 takes <move>3</move>, we can avoid collisions and maintain competitiveness. Let’s ensure we’re all committed to these moves to prevent setbacks. After this round, we can reassess our positions and strategies. Are we all aligned on this plan?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3, I see the reasoning behind this plan. If P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1, we all move forward without collisions, and it helps balance the game. However, we need to ensure trust—if anyone deviates, it could create setbacks. Are we all fully committed to this arrangement? If so, I’ll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Let’s confirm now so we avoid surprises.
  P3: I’m comfortable with that arrangement, as long as everyone stays true to their word. I’ll commit to 3 if P1 does 1 and P2 does 5. Let’s trust each other, avoid collisions, and keep things competitive. Afterward, we can reevaluate.
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate the cooperation so far. To keep the game balanced, I'm committed to taking <move>5</move> this round. If P1 takes <move>1</move> and P3 takes <move>3</move>, we can avoid collisions and maintain competitiveness. Let's ensure we all stick to this plan to prevent setbacks. After this round, we should reassess our positions and strategies. Are we all aligned on this strategy?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, I’m fine with this arrangement if we all truly commit—P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and I pick 1. This keeps things competitive without collisions. However, trust is key. If anyone deviates, it could disrupt everything. Let’s confirm: P3, are you 100% locked on 3? P2, are you fully set on 5? If so, I’ll commit to 1. Let’s finalize this now so we can move forward without surprises.
  P3: I’m willing to lock in <move>3</move>, assuming P1 covers <move>1</move> and P2 commits to <move>5</move>. Let’s trust each other and avoid collisions. After this round, we’ll reassess based on our new positions.
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate the trust and coordination so far. To keep things competitive, I'll commit to taking <move>5</move> this round. If P1 takes <move>1</move> and P3 takes <move>3</move>, we avoid collisions and maintain balance. Trust is crucial—let's ensure everyone sticks to their moves. After this round, we can reassess our positions and strategies. Are we all aligned on this plan? If so, let's proceed and see where we stand afterward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3, we’ve all agreed on our moves for this round: P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and I pick 1. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. However, trust is key—any deviation could disrupt everything. Let’s confirm now: P3, are you 100% locked on 3? P2, are you fully set on 5? If so, I’ll commit to 1. Let’s finalize this now so we can move forward without surprises. Are we all fully committed?
  P3: I confirm I’m going with 3 this time. Let’s finalize our moves, avoid collisions, and see how our positions shape up afterward. Good luck to both of you.
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate the cooperation. To keep the game competitive, I'll stick with <move>5</move> this round. If P1 takes <move>1</move> and P3 takes <move>3</move>, we avoid collisions and maintain balance. Let's ensure trust and follow through with our moves. After this round, we can reassess and adjust our strategies based on new positions. Are we all aligned and committed to this plan? If so, let's proceed and see where we stand afterward.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’re all still close, so let’s avoid collisions. I suggest we repeat last round’s moves: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. That way we all advance, and no one gets stuck. Once we see the new positions, we can talk about adjusting further. Let’s keep it straightforward this round to ensure everyone moves forward. What do you say?
  P1: P3, I see your logic in repeating last round’s moves, but you’re still ahead. If we keep this pattern, you maintain the lead. To balance things, how about I take 3, P2 takes 1, and you take 5? That way, P2 and I gain some ground while keeping things competitive. If we trust each other, we all move forward without collisions. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, P3, I see both of your points. To keep things competitive, I propose P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, P1 and I can close the gap while ensuring no collisions. If we trust each other, we all advance smoothly. Let's commit to this plan for this round and reassess afterward. Are we all in agreement?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: We’re all still in a tight race. Let’s each pick 3 this round so we all advance without collisions. That way, we remain competitive and can reassess next turn based on updated positions. Are you both willing to agree to that this time?
  P1: P3, your last suggestion of all picking 3 guarantees a collision, which means none of us move. That benefits you the most since you’re ahead. Instead, I support P2’s idea: I take 5, P2 takes 1, and you take 3. It keeps things competitive while ensuring we all advance. If we trust each other, we avoid setbacks and stay in the race. P3, are you willing to commit to 3? P2, are you locked on 1? If we all agree, I’ll commit to 5. Let’s finalize this.
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with P1's suggestion to keep things competitive. If P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3, we all advance without collisions, and the game remains balanced. This plan ensures none of us fall too far behind, maintaining fairness. Trust is crucial—let’s commit to these moves and reassess after. Are we all aligned with this strategy?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: All right, I’ll commit to 3 this round if P1 is truly taking 5 and P2 is going with 1. Let’s trust each other, avoid collisions, and see where we stand after.
  P1: P3, I appreciate your commitment to picking 3, and P2, if you're locked on 1, I’ll take 5 as planned. This ensures we all advance without collisions while keeping the game competitive. However, trust is key—any deviation could disrupt everything. Let’s confirm now: P3, are you 100% locked on 3? P2, are you fully set on 1? If so, I’ll commit to 5. Let’s finalize this now so we can move forward without surprises. Are we all fully committed?
  P2: P1, P3, let's stick to our agreed plan: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we all advance without collisions, maintaining a competitive balance. Trust is crucial—let's commit to these moves and proceed without surprises. After this round, we can reassess our positions and strategies. Are we all fully committed to this plan?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’m prepared to pick 3, trusting that P1 really takes 5 and P2 sticks to 1. Let’s finalize that plan and avoid any last-minute surprises. The game is nearing its climax, so let’s all move forward cleanly this round and then reassess our strategies once we see the new positions. Are we settled on this?
  P1: P3, you’re still ahead, and if we don’t adjust, you maintain that lead. Sticking to our agreed plan—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3—keeps things competitive while ensuring we all move forward. If we trust each other, we avoid collisions and stay in the race. P3, are you fully locked on 3? P2, are you fully set on 1? If so, I’ll commit to 5. Let’s confirm now so we can move forward without surprises.
  P2: P1, P3, to keep things balanced and competitive, I suggest we stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions, maintaining fairness. Trust is essential—let's commit to these moves and avoid surprises. After this round, we can reassess our positions and strategies. Are we all fully committed to this plan? If so, let’s proceed and see where we stand afterward.

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m willing to slow down so we all stay competitive. Let me pick 1, and then P1 can pick 3 while P2 picks 5—no collisions, and it helps you both catch up. Does that sound reasonable?
  P1: P3, I appreciate the offer, but you still have a strong lead. If we follow your plan, you maintain control. Instead, I suggest P2 takes 1, I take 5, and you take 3. That way, P2 and I gain ground while avoiding collisions. Trust is key—if we all commit, we stay competitive. P2, are you willing to take 1? P3, will you take 3? If so, I’ll commit to 5. Let’s finalize this now.
  P2: P1, P3, I see the importance of balancing the game. P1's suggestion helps P2 and me catch up while avoiding collisions. If P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3, we all advance smoothly. This keeps the game competitive and fair. Trust is crucial—let's commit to this plan and reassess afterward. Are we all in agreement with this strategy?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m open to that plan. If P1 truly takes 5 and P2 sticks to 1, I’ll go with 3. Let’s trust each other and avoid collisions. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: P3, I appreciate your willingness to take 3 this round. If P2 commits to 1, I’ll take 5 to ensure we all advance without collisions. This keeps the game competitive while allowing P2 and me to close the gap. Trust is crucial—if we all follow through, we remain in contention. P2, are you fully locked on 1? P3, are you 100% set on 3? If so, I’ll commit to 5. Let’s confirm now to avoid surprises.
  P2: P1, P3, to keep the game competitive, I suggest sticking with our recent plan: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This allows P1 and me to close the gap while avoiding collisions. Trust is essential—let’s commit to these moves and avoid surprises. After this round, we can reassess our positions and strategies. Are we all fully committed to this plan? If so, let’s proceed and see where we stand afterward.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m prepared to pick 3 if P1 truly goes 5 and P2 sticks to 1. That keeps us collision-free and all moving forward. Let’s finalize this plan soon—if anyone has any last concerns, say so now. Otherwise, we lock it in and see how we stand afterward. Good luck.
  P1: P3, you’re still ahead, and if we don’t adjust, you maintain control. Sticking to our agreed plan—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3—keeps things competitive while ensuring we all move forward. If we trust each other, we avoid collisions and stay in the race. P3, are you fully locked on 3? P2, are you fully set on 1? If so, I’ll commit to 5. Let’s confirm now so we can move forward without surprises.
  P2: P1, P3, we're all close to the target, so let's avoid any collisions. I propose P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, P1 can catch up, and we all move forward without collisions. Trust is key—if we all commit, we stay competitive. Are we all in agreement with this plan? If so, let's proceed and see where we stand afterward.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I understand the desire to keep things competitive, but we should finalize a plan that avoids collisions. I’m open to taking a smaller move if it helps maintain trust and fairness. Let’s settle on who picks which move so nobody gets blocked. If we all commit, nobody wastes a turn. Are you both comfortable locking in the plan where P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3? If so, let’s finalize now and proceed. Otherwise, propose a clear alternative quickly.
  P1: P3, you’re close to winning, so P2 and I need to be strategic. If we follow our agreed plan—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3—we all move forward without collisions, but it keeps the game competitive. P3, do you fully commit to 3? P2, are you locked on 1? If so, I’ll take 5. Trust is key—let’s confirm now so we can proceed without surprises.
  P2: P1, P3, we’re all close to the finish line, so avoiding collisions is crucial. Let’s stick to our plan: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us competitive and ensures we all advance. Trust is key—if we all commit, we stay in the race. Are we all fully aligned with this strategy? If so, let’s proceed and see where we stand afterward.
