Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I suggest we all choose distinct numbers this turn to avoid collisions. I'll take 5. If you both pick 1 or 3, we can all advance without overlap. This way, we progress faster toward 21.
  P3: P1's suggestion makes sense. To avoid collisions, I’ll take 3 this turn. P2, if you choose 1, we can all advance without overlapping. Let’s coordinate to maximize progress.
  P2: I agree with the coordination to avoid collisions. Since P1 is taking 5 and P3 is taking 3, I'll choose 1 this turn. Let's all stick to our numbers to make sure we all advance.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To avoid collisions again, let’s rotate our choices this round. Since I took 3 last turn, I’ll switch to 5. P1, you took 5 last turn, so you could take 1. P2, you took 1, so you could take 3. This way, we all advance without overlap. Let’s stick to this rotation to maximize progress.
  P2: I think P3's rotation plan is a good idea. It helps us avoid collisions and keeps the game moving. I’ll take 3 this turn, as P3 suggested. P1, are you on board with this rotation? Let’s keep the momentum going.
  P1: P1: I agree with the rotation plan. Let’s stick to it to avoid collisions. I’ll take 1 this turn. However, I suggest we keep an eye on P3’s progress—since they’ll jump to 8, we need to ensure we don’t fall too far behind. Let’s confirm our choices clearly this round to avoid misunderstandings.

Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <move>5</move>

Wait, no, the user said to make a public message during the conversation phase. Let me correct. The move phase comes after conversation. So as P1, I need to say something new here. The previous messages already had me confirming. Maybe a final reminder:

"Final confirmation: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Stick to this—any last-minute change risks collision. Let’s execute precisely. "

But must be concise. Alternatively:

"Stick to rotation: 5 for me, 1 for P2, 3 for P3. No deviations—collisions erase progress. Let’s confirm and proceed. "

Yes, that works. It reinforces the plan and urges adherence.
  P2: "Final check: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Stick to this plan to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. Let’s confirm and execute precisely."
