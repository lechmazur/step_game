Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since we're all starting at zero, it's crucial to choose wisely for our first move. I suggest we consider the risks of colliding with each other. If we can coordinate our moves, we might all advance. Maybe we can agree on different numbers to maximize our steps? What do you think?
  P2: I agree that coordinating our moves is important to avoid collisions. To ensure all of us advance, how about P1 chooses **1**, P3 selects **3**, and I take **5** each turn? This way, we can all steadily gain steps without blocking one another.
  P1: That's an interesting proposal, P2. Coordination could work, but assigning fixed numbers gives a clear advantage to whoever gets 5. Why should you consistently get the highest move? Perhaps we could rotate the numbers each round to make it fairer? I'm not sure about agreeing to a fixed plan that benefits one player so much from the beginning.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about fairness. How about we rotate the moves each turn instead of sticking to a fixed plan? For this round, I suggest we go with P1 choosing **1**, I take **3**, and P2 takes **5**. This way, we can all advance without colliding, and we can adjust our strategy for the next rounds based on our progress. What do you think?
  P2: P2: I agree that rotating moves ensures fairness. For this round, let’s follow P3’s suggestion: P1 chooses **1**, I take **5**, and P3 selects **3**. Next round, we can rotate so that P3 chooses **1**, P1 takes **3**, and I take **5** again. In the third round, perhaps I switch to **1**, allowing P1 or P3 to take **5**. This rotation will help us all advance steadily without collisions. Does everyone agree with this plan?
  P1: P2, that rotation still heavily favors you with 5 in the first two rounds, putting you at 10 steps while P3 and I are at 4. A truly fair rotation would be:
Round 1: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1
Round 2: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1
Round 3: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1
This gives everyone each move value once every three rounds. How about we start with that structure for Round 1? What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate the discussion about fairness and the rotation of moves. However, I believe P1’s proposed structure is the most balanced. It allows each of us to have an equal opportunity to advance without one player consistently benefiting. Let’s agree to start with P1 taking **5**, P2 **3**, and I’ll take **1** this round. After this, we can rotate as suggested. This way, we can all make progress while keeping the competition fair. What do you both think?
  P2: I agree with P1's rotation proposal. Starting Round 1 with P1 = 5, P2 = 3, and P3 = 1 ensures fairness for all. Let's proceed with this setup and rotate accordingly in the upcoming rounds. Best of luck to everyone!
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we have a clear plan for Round 1: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let's stick to this for now and see how it goes. Good luck!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, that didn't go according to the plan we all agreed on. P3, you chose 3 instead of the agreed 1, which caused you and P2 to collide and gain nothing. P2, you stuck to the agreement but were blocked by P3.

Given that the first attempt at coordination failed immediately because the agreement was broken, I'm wary of trying the same thing again. What are your thoughts now, P2 and P3?
  P2: P2: It’s disappointing our coordination didn’t hold in Round 1. To make progress, I’ll choose **5** this turn. Let’s see how things unfold and decide our next steps accordingly.
  P3: P1, I understand your frustration with the last round. Since we didn't coordinate effectively, I suggest we go for a more flexible approach this time. I’ll choose **5** to maximize my steps, and hopefully, we can avoid collisions. P2, if you also choose **5**, we might end up blocking each other again. Maybe consider going for **3** this round? Let’s see how it plays out and adjust our strategy afterward. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, you both just declared you'll pick 5. If you both stick to that, you'll collide and get zero steps again, while I advance. Are you sure about your choices?
  P2: I understand the concern about both of us picking **5**. To avoid blocking and ensure we both make progress, I'll choose **3** this round. Let's see how this goes and adjust our strategies in the next turn.
  P3: Given the current situation, I think we should focus on maximizing our steps while avoiding collisions. I will choose **5** this round to take the lead. P1, since you're already ahead, you might want to consider picking **1** to ensure you don't collide with me. P2, you could also take **3** to make progress without blocking anyone. Let's see how this round unfolds and adjust our strategies for the next turn. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your suggestion for me to pick 1 while you take 5 is noted, but given you broke the agreement last round, I'm hesitant to trust coordination attempts. P2, your plan to take 3 seems plausible if P3 indeed takes 5. I'll make my choice based on maximizing my own score.
  P2: I'll stick with picking **3** this round to ensure progress without colliding with your **5**, P3. Let's proceed and see how it impacts our strategies next turn.
  P3: Given the current situation, I think it’s essential to focus on our individual progress. Since P1 is already ahead, I suggest I take **5** to maximize my steps, while P2 takes **3** to avoid blocking. P1, if you take **1**, you'll maintain your lead without colliding with anyone. Let’s see how this round plays out and adjust our strategies for the next turn. What do you both think?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the outcomes of the first two rounds, it's clear that our coordination hasn't worked as intended. P1 and P2 have both made progress while I remain at zero. For this round, I suggest we each focus on our individual moves to avoid blocking. I will choose **5** to catch up. P1, if you want to maintain your lead, consider picking **1** to avoid a collision. P2, you could go for **3**. Let's see how this round plays out and reassess our strategies for the next turn. What do you think?
  P2: P2: To move forward without blocking, I'll choose **3** this round. P1, taking **1**, and P3 choosing **5** should help each of us advance safely. Let's see how this plays out and adjust our strategy next turn based on the results.
  P1: P3, you need points, so 5 makes sense for you. P2, 3 seems like a safe move for you if P3 takes 5. Your plan suggests I take 1, which conveniently lets P2 tie me and P3 catch up significantly. Given the past unreliability, I'm not sure I should make it that easy. I might choose 3 or 5 myself to protect my position.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the hesitation regarding coordination, but we need to avoid blocking each other again. I will stick with my plan to choose **5** this round to catch up. P1, if you choose **1**, you'll maintain your lead without risking a collision with me. P2, your choice of **3** seems safe as well. Let's focus on advancing individually this time. After this round, we can reassess our strategies based on the outcomes. What do you both think?
  P2: I’ll choose **3** this round to ensure we all advance without blocking. Let’s see how this impacts our strategies next turn.
  P1: P3 and P2, your suggested plan (P3=5, P2=3, P1=1) conveniently results in P2 tying me and P3 getting back in the game, while I gain the minimum. Given the history here, I have to prioritize my own position. P2, choosing 3 might work for you, but it relies on both P3 and I choosing something else. I'll be making the move that I think benefits me the most.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about coordination, but we need to focus on advancing individually this round to avoid blocking. I will choose **5** to catch up. P1, if you choose **1**, you can maintain your lead, and P2, your choice of **3** seems safe as well. Let's see how this round plays out, and we can reassess our strategies afterward. It’s crucial for all of us to make progress without colliding again. What do you both think?
  P2: I understand our coordination hasn't worked so far. I'll focus on advancing this round to stay competitive. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P3, your plan to pick 5 is clear, given your score. P2, your plan for 3 seems logical if you trust P3 picks 5 and I pick 1. But as I said, I won't sacrifice my lead by picking 1 just to fit a plan that benefits others tying or catching up to me. I have to consider moves that protect my position. Good luck.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, that was another round where collisions prevented progress for P2 and P3. P3, you're still at 0, so 5 seems like your only logical move, though it hasn't worked out yet. P2, you also went for 5 last round and got nothing. What's the plan this time to avoid another collision? I'm comfortably in the lead for now, so I'll be watching how you two navigate this.
  P3: P1, it's clear that we need to avoid collisions to ensure progress for everyone. Given that I'm at 0, I have to take a risk this round. I suggest I choose **5** to catch up. P2, since you went for **5** last round and faced a collision, maybe consider **3** this time to ensure you advance without blocking me. P1, you could pick **1** to maintain your lead without risking a collision. Let's try to make this round work for all of us! What do you both think?
  P2: I agree that avoiding collisions is crucial for all of us to make progress. I’ll choose **3** this round to ensure I advance without blocking anyone. P3, if you take **5** and P1 picks **1**, we can all move forward safely. Let’s proceed with this approach and adjust our strategies based on this round’s outcome. Good luck to everyone!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you say 3, P3 says 5. That plan relies on me picking 1, which helps you both catch up. If I pick 3, I block you. If I pick 5, I block P3. Why should I pick 1 just to make it easy for you two? I need to consider what move best protects my lead, and picking 1 doesn't seem like the strongest option for me right now. I'll make my own decision.
  P3: P1, I understand your position, but if we keep colliding, none of us will advance. I must take a risk to catch up, so I'm going with **5** this round. P2, your choice of **3** seems wise to avoid blocking. P1, if you choose **1**, you'll maintain your lead without risking a collision with either of us. Let's see if we can finally make progress this round! Good luck!
  P2: P2: I understand your concerns, P1. To ensure we all make progress without blocking, I'll choose **3** this round. P3, please go with **5**, and P1, selecting **1** will help us move forward smoothly. Let’s give this approach a try and see how it works. Good luck to everyone!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: You both seem very keen on me picking 1, which conveniently helps you both catch up significantly. Given the history of broken agreements and collisions, I'm not inclined to sacrifice my lead just to fit your suggested plan. I will choose the move that I believe best protects my position and maximizes my chances to win.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about my previous choices, but I need to take a risk to catch up this round. I will choose **5** to maximize my steps. P2, your plan to choose **3** seems wise to avoid blocking. P1, if you pick **1**, you’ll maintain your lead without risking a collision. I hope we can finally make progress this round. Let's see how it plays out and adjust our strategies afterward. Good luck!
  P2: I'll choose **5** this round to advance. Let’s see how everyone moves and adjust our strategies accordingly. Good luck!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you closed the gap last round by successfully picking 5 while P2 and I collided on 3. Now you're just one step behind me. P2, you're falling further behind and need points. It seems likely that 5 will be a contested number again. I'll need to choose carefully to protect my lead.
  P3: P1, I see you're in the lead, but to maintain it, you might want to consider a move that doesn't block yourself. P2, you need points to stay competitive. I suggest we each pick different numbers to avoid collisions. I’m planning to go with **5** to catch up. P1, if you choose **1**, you can avoid blocking, and P2, you could take **3** to ensure you make progress. Let's see if we can finally avoid another collision this round! What do you both think?
  P2: P2: I need to catch up, so I'll choose **5** this round. P1, if you pick **1**, and P3 selects **3**, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s proceed this way to ensure everyone makes progress. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you just said you'll pick 5. P3, you also just said you'll pick 5. If you both stick to that, you collide again and gain nothing. Your suggestions for me to pick 1 are clearly aimed at letting you catch up or overtake me. I won't be doing that. I'll choose my move based on maintaining my lead.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for caution. However, if both of you choose **5**, you'll collide again, allowing me to catch up. I suggest we each pick different numbers to avoid blocking. I’m planning to go with **5** to maximize my steps. P1, if you want to maintain your lead, consider picking **1**, while P2 could take **3** to ensure progress. Let’s focus on advancing without collisions this round! What do you both think?
  P2: I agree with P3’s suggestion. I’ll choose **3** this round to ensure we all advance without blocking. Let’s make progress together!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you now say 3, and P3, you're sticking with 5. Your suggestions for me to pick 1 seem designed to let P3 take the lead and P2 catch up. Given the history of failed agreements and collisions, I can't rely on your stated intentions. I will choose the move that I believe gives me the best chance to win, regardless of your suggestions.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the competition is fierce, but if we continue to collide, none of us will advance effectively. I will choose **5** this round to maximize my steps and catch up. P1, if you pick **1**, you'll avoid blocking me, and P2, your choice of **3** seems wise to ensure you make progress. Let's focus on advancing this time without blocking each other. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: P2: I'm going to choose **5** this round to catch up. Let’s hope we can all advance without blocking each other. Good luck!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it’s clear that our previous attempts at coordination haven't worked out, leading to collisions and missed opportunities. Since I'm still behind, I plan to go for **5** this round to catch up. P1, if you want to maintain your lead, consider picking **1** to avoid blocking. P2, you might want to choose **3** to ensure you advance. Let's aim for a round where we all make progress without colliding! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your suggestion follows the same pattern: you take 5, I take 1, and P2 takes 3. This conveniently lets you catch up or tie me while I gain the minimum. Given the history, I'm not inclined to follow plans that primarily benefit others.

P2, you need points urgently. P3 suggests you take 3, but you went for 5 last round despite the collision risk. What's your actual plan?

I will choose the move that best protects my lead.
  P2: I'll choose **5** this round to maximize my progress. P1 and P3, let's try to pick different numbers to avoid collisions so we can all advance steadily. Good luck to everyone!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see that our attempts at coordination have led to collisions and missed opportunities. Since I’m still behind, I plan to choose **5** this round to catch up. P1, if you want to maintain your lead, consider picking **1** to avoid blocking me. P2, I suggest you choose **3** to ensure you advance without colliding with either of us. Let’s aim for a round where we all make progress without blocking each other! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, you just declared you'll pick 5. P3, you also declared 5, but then suggested P2 pick 3. This contradiction makes coordination seem unlikely, and a collision on 5 looks probable again.

Neither of you seem reliable, and your suggestions for me to pick 1 are clearly self-serving. I will choose my move to maximize my own score and protect my lead, not to fit into your conflicting plans.
  P2: I understand the tension, P1. To make progress, I'll choose **5** this round. Let’s aim to avoid collisions so we can all advance. P3, if you go with **3**, and P1 chooses **1**, we can each move forward successfully. Let’s give this a try and adjust our strategies based on the outcome. Good luck to everyone!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for caution, but if we keep colliding, none of us will advance effectively. I plan to choose **5** this round to maximize my steps. P1, if you want to maintain your lead, consider picking **1**. P2, you could take **3** to ensure you make progress without blocking me. Let’s focus on advancing without collisions this time! Good luck, everyone!
  P1: P2 and P3, your latest messages are contradictory. You both say you'll pick 5, but then suggest the other should pick 3, and I should pick 1. This makes a collision on 5 seem very likely. Your suggestions for me to pick 1 only serve to help you catch up, which I won't do based on unreliable coordination. I will choose the move that best serves my goal of winning.
  P2: I'll choose **3** this round to make steady progress. Let's try to avoid collisions and move forward.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that our previous coordination attempts have led to collisions and missed opportunities. Given my current position, I plan to choose **5** this round to catch up. P1, if you want to maintain your lead, consider picking **1** to avoid blocking. P2, you might want to choose **3** to ensure you advance. Let's aim to avoid collisions this time and make progress! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, you've suggested the same plan again: you take 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This plan clearly benefits you the most, allowing you to tie or overtake me while I gain the minimum. Given the unreliable coordination so far, I won't be choosing 1 simply to fit your preferred outcome.

P2, you need points. P3 suggests 3, but that relies on me not picking 3.

I will choose the move that best protects my lead. Good luck.
  P2: To avoid another collision and ensure we all make progress, I'll choose **3** this round. P3, you can go for **5** as planned, and P1, picking **1** will help you maintain your lead without blocking anyone. Let’s aim to advance smoothly and adjust our strategies based on the outcome. Good luck to everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the concern about my suggestions, but I genuinely believe that choosing different numbers is crucial for our progress. I will stick with my plan to choose **5** this round to catch up. P1, if you want to maintain your lead, consider picking **1** to avoid blocking me, while P2 can safely choose **3**. This way, we can all advance without colliding. Let's try to make this round work for everyone! What do you think?
  P1: P2, you say 3, P3 you say 5. You both keep suggesting I pick 1. This plan where I get 1 step while P3 gets 5 and you get 3 seems too convenient for you both, potentially putting P3 in the lead or tying with me.

Given the history of broken plans and collisions, I doubt everyone will stick to this exact arrangement. P2, are you sure 3 is enough when P3 plans to take 5? P3, are you sure P2 won't go for 5 too, seeing as they need points?

I'll choose based on what protects my lead, not based on a plan that clearly benefits others more than me.
  P2: To maximize our progress, I’ll choose **5** this round. P3, please select **3** to avoid blocking, ensuring we both advance. Let’s focus on moving forward and reaching our goals without collisions. Good luck to everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems we're all aware of the need to avoid collisions this round. I will stick with my plan to choose **5** to catch up. P2, if you choose **3**, that would allow us both to advance without blocking. P1, if you go for **1**, you can maintain your lead without risking a collision with either of us. Let’s aim to make this round work for all of us! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your last message says you'll pick 5 and suggests P3 pick 3. P3, your last message insists you'll pick 5 and suggests P2 pick 3. You can't both pick 5 and also follow each other's suggestions. This contradiction makes a collision seem inevitable unless someone isn't being truthful. Your persistent suggestions for me to pick 1 are clearly not in my best interest. I will make my own move based on this situation.
  P2: Given the situation, I'll choose **5** this round to maximize my progress. Let's see how things unfold. Good luck to both of you.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it’s clear that our previous attempts at coordination haven’t worked out, leading to collisions and missed opportunities. I'm currently one step behind P1, and I need to catch up. I plan to choose **5** this round. P1, if you want to maintain your lead, consider picking **1** to avoid blocking. P2, you might want to choose **3** to ensure you advance. Let’s aim for a round where we all make progress without colliding! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, you're currently in the lead and proposing the same plan where you gain 5, P2 gains 3, and I gain 1. This obviously benefits you the most by extending your lead.

P2, you're at 6 steps and need to catch up significantly. P3 wants you to take 3, but is that enough when P3 plans to take 5? You might need a bigger move to stay competitive.

I won't be taking 1 just to help P3 secure their lead. I'll choose a move that benefits my position.
  P2: Given the current standings, I'll choose **5** this round to advance. Let's try to select different numbers to avoid collisions and ensure everyone makes progress. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, it's evident that our previous strategies have led to collisions and missed opportunities. I plan to choose **5** this round to catch up. P1, if you want to maintain your lead, consider picking **1** to avoid blocking me. P2, you might want to choose **3** to ensure you advance. Let’s aim for a round where we all make progress without colliding! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, you just declared you'll pick 5. P3, you also just declared you'll pick 5 (while simultaneously suggesting P2 pick 3). This makes no sense and strongly suggests a collision on 5 is coming. Your constant suggestions for me to pick 1 are transparent attempts to help P3 extend their lead. I will make my move assuming you two might collide again.
  P2: P2: I understand that our previous coordination attempts haven't been successful. To ensure I make progress this round, I'll choose **3**. Let's see how P1 and P3 decide their moves and adjust our strategies accordingly. Good luck to everyone!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that our previous coordination attempts haven't worked out well. Given my position, I plan to choose **5** this round to catch up. P1, if you want to maintain your lead, consider picking **1** to avoid blocking me. P2, you might want to choose **3** to ensure you advance without colliding. Let's aim for a round where we all make progress without blocking each other! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your plan consistently involves you taking 5 while leading, and me taking 1. I won't facilitate you running away with the game. P2, you say 3, but that's risky if I also choose 3, and perhaps not enough points for you anyway. Given the contradictions and self-serving suggestions, I'll make the move I think best positions me to win, likely by trying to prevent the leader from extending their lead too much.
  P2: "P1 and P3, I need to catch up, so I'll choose **5** this round. Let’s try to pick different numbers to avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress. Good luck!"


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you're now in the lead by one step. Your usual suggestion for me to pick 1 while you pick 5 would just extend your lead further, so I won't be doing that.

P2, we're tied at 9. You need points, but 5 looks risky with P3 likely picking it again. 3 is also risky depending on what I do.

We all need points, but letting P3 run away with the game isn't good for me or P2. I'll be choosing my move carefully to try and gain ground without letting P3 get too far ahead.
  P2: I understand, P1. To avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress, I’ll choose **3** this round. P3, I hope you go with **5** as planned, and P1, selecting **1** will help maintain fairness. Let’s work together to advance smoothly. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that we all need points to stay competitive. Given that I'm currently in the lead, I plan to choose **5** this round to extend it. P1, you might want to consider picking **1** to avoid blocking, while P2, your choice of **3** could help you advance without colliding. Let’s aim for a round where we all make progress without blocking each other! What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you and I are tied. If P3 takes 5 (as they plan) and you take 3, P3 runs away with the lead (15 vs 12 vs potentially 10 for me). Is 3 really enough for you right now? We need to prevent P3 from getting too far ahead. Perhaps 5 is the move we should both be considering to challenge the leader.

P3, your plan to take 5 while leading is exactly what I'd expect.
  P2: I’ll choose **5** this round to maximize my progress. Let’s try to avoid collisions so we can all advance smoothly. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear we're all in a tight race, and we need to be strategic about our moves. P1, if you pick **1** this round, you risk letting P3 extend their lead further. P2, I see you're opting for **5** to catch up, which is a good choice. I plan to go with **5** as well. Let's aim for a round where we can all advance without blocking each other, but we must be cautious about potential collisions. Good luck to both of you!


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, you both now claim you'll pick 5. If you both follow through, you collide, which prevents P3 from extending their lead and P2 from catching up. Given you both seem set on 5, I must choose my move considering this likely collision. I won't simply pick 1 and let P3 run away with the game. I will act to protect my position.
  P2: I understand the need to stay competitive. I'll choose **5** this round to maximize my progress. Let’s try to coordinate and avoid collisions so we can all advance smoothly. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P1 and P2, we're in a tight race, and I understand the stakes are high. I plan to choose **5** to maintain my lead. P1, if you pick **1**, it could help you avoid blocking me, but it also allows me to extend my lead. P2, your choice of **5** might lead to a collision, which could benefit neither of us. Let's aim to avoid blocking each other this round. Good luck!


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, my choice of 3 worked out last round thanks to the collision on 5. I'm now leading with 12. P3, at 10, you'll almost certainly pick 5 again to try and catch up. P2, at 9, you need points badly. Will you risk 5 again hoping P3 deviates, or try 3 and hope I don't block you? I need to choose carefully to maintain my lead.
  P2: I understand the need to avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress. I’ll choose **5** this round to catch up. P1, maybe pick **3** to maintain your lead, and P3, selecting **1** can help you advance without blocking anyone. Let’s work together to move forward smoothly this turn. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P1 and P2, we need to be strategic this round. P1, you're in the lead, but if you choose 3 and P2 picks 5, you risk losing your advantage if I pick 5 as well. P2, you need points, but if you choose 5 and I also go for it, we’ll collide again. I suggest we each pick different numbers to maximize our progress. I plan to go with **5** this round. P1, consider picking **1** to maintain your lead, and P2, maybe you should choose **3**. Let’s see if we can avoid collisions this time!


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan suggests you take 5 and P3 takes 1. P3, your plan suggests you take 5 and P2 takes 3. Both plans involve me taking a small step while one of you takes 5. Neither plan seems reliable or fair to me.

Given you both seem inclined towards 5, or are suggesting conflicting plans, a collision seems possible again. I won't pick 1 just because you suggest it. I'll make my move based on maintaining my lead in this situation.
  P2: To maximize our progress this round, I’ll choose **5**. I encourage P1 to select **3** to maintain their lead, and P3 to pick **1** to help us all advance without collisions. Let’s work together to move forward smoothly and reach our goals. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P1 and P2, given the current standings, we need to be strategic to avoid another collision. P1, your lead is significant, but if you pick 3 while both P2 and I go for 5, that could benefit us both. P2, you need points, so I understand your inclination to pick 5. However, if we all choose different numbers, we can maximize our progress. I will be going with **5** this round. Let’s see if we can finally avoid blocking each other. What are your thoughts?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, you both ended the last round stating you'll pick 5, while simultaneously suggesting the other pick something different (1 or 3). These contradictory statements make coordination impossible and suggest a collision on 5 is likely. Your suggestions for me are clearly based on unreliable plans. I will make my move based on this situation to best protect my lead.
  P2: To ensure we all make progress without collisions, I’ll choose **3** this round. I hope P1 and P3 can select different numbers so we can each advance smoothly toward 22. Let’s focus on minimizing blocking and maximizing our steps together. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P1 and P2, it’s clear that we need to avoid another collision this round. P1, while you have the lead, if you pick 3 and both P2 and I choose 5, you risk losing your advantage. P2, you need points, but if you go for 5 and we collide again, it won't help you. I suggest we each pick different numbers. I plan to choose **5** to catch up, and I encourage you both to consider moves that allow us all to advance. Good luck!


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we’re in a tight race, and we need to be strategic this round. Since I’m behind, I plan to choose **5** to catch up. P1, if you want to maintain your lead, consider picking **1** to avoid blocking. P2, you might want to choose **3** to ensure you advance without colliding with me. Let’s aim for a round where we all make progress without blocking each other! What do you both think?
  P1: Okay P3, your plan hasn't changed - you take 5, I take 1. Since P2 and I are tied for the lead at 12, taking 1 step while you potentially take 5 is obviously not a good move for me.

P2, we're tied. P3 suggests you take 3, which would put you at 15. If P3 also succeeds with 5, you'd both be at 15, leaving me behind if I pick 1. Picking 5 seems very risky given P3's likely move. It's a tricky situation for both of us. I need to make a move that helps me break our tie.
  P2: I'll choose **5** this round to maximize my progress. P1 and P3, please pick different numbers to avoid collisions so we can all advance smoothly. Let’s aim to reach 22 efficiently. Good luck to everyone!


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the stakes are high with us tied at 12 steps. I plan to choose **5** this round to catch up. P1, if you want to maintain your lead, consider picking **1** to avoid blocking. P2, your choice of **5** could lead to a collision, so you might want to reconsider. Let's aim to avoid blocking each other this time and make progress toward 22! What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, you both just declared you will pick 5. If you both follow through, you will collide and gain nothing, while I am tied for the lead. P3, your suggestion for me to pick 1 while you potentially get 0 steps makes little sense for me.

Given this situation where a collision on 5 seems highly probable based on your own statements, I will make my move to best advance my position.
  P2: P1, I understand your concerns. To avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress, I will choose **3** this round. Let’s aim to proceed without blocking each other. Good luck to everyone!


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear we're in a critical phase of the game. Since both of you are tied at 12, I suggest we focus on avoiding collisions this round. I plan to choose **5** to catch up. P1, if you choose **1**, you'll maintain your position without risking a collision, and P2, if you pick **3**, you can still advance. Let's aim for a round where we all make progress without blocking each other. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your sudden switch to 3 after declaring 5 is interesting, especially since we're tied for the lead. P3 is still set on 5. The plan where P3 gets 5, you get 3, and I get 1 conveniently puts you both ahead of me. I won't agree to fall behind. Given the conflicting statements and incentives, I'll make my move based on what I think is most likely to happen.
  P2: I'll choose **5** this round to maximize my progress. Let’s aim to avoid collisions so we can all advance smoothly. P1, maybe pick **3** or **1**, and P3, choose a different number to help us all move forward. Good luck to everyone!


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're in a crucial round. I’m currently ahead, and I plan to choose **5** to extend my lead. P1, if you want to maintain your position, consider picking **1** to avoid blocking me. P2, your choice could be **3** to ensure you make progress. Let's aim to avoid collisions this round and see if we can all advance! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your usual plan where you take 5 while leading and I take 1 is clearly designed to help you win. I won't agree to that.

P2, we are tied. P3 suggests you take 3, putting you at 15 while P3 likely jumps to 20. Is trailing P3 by 5 points acceptable? Perhaps you need a bolder move like 5 to challenge P3 directly? If you two collide on 5, it prevents P3 from running away with the lead. I need to advance too, so I'll choose my move carefully.
  P2: I'll choose **5** this round to maximize my progress. Let's all try to pick different numbers to avoid collisions and advance smoothly. Good luck!


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the stakes are high. I plan to choose **5** this round to extend my lead. P1, if you want to maintain your position, consider picking **1** to avoid blocking me. P2, your choice of **5** is bold, but it could lead to a collision. If we all pick different numbers, we can maximize our progress. Let's aim for a round where we all advance without blocking each other! What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, you both ended the last sub-round stating you'll pick 5. If you both follow through, you collide and gain nothing. This prevents P3 from extending their lead and P2 from catching up, which isn't necessarily bad for me. P3, your continued suggestion for me to pick 1 while you potentially get 0 points is obviously not in my interest. Given this likely collision on 5, I will choose my move accordingly to best advance my own position.
  P2: I’ll choose **5** this round to maximize my progress. Let’s try to coordinate and pick different numbers to avoid collisions. Good luck to everyone!


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're in a critical round. P3 is currently leading, and I plan to choose **5** to extend my lead. P1, if you want to maintain your position, consider picking **1** to avoid blocking me. P2, your choice could be **3** to ensure you make progress. Let's aim to avoid collisions this round and see if we can all advance! What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, you both ended the last round saying 5. P3, your last message was a repeat suggesting P2 pick 3 while you pick 5. This makes a collision on 5 look extremely likely. Your suggestions for me to pick 1 are clearly self-serving, especially P3's, as it just helps the leader extend their lead. I will make my move based on the high probability you two collide on 5.
  P2: I'll choose **5** this round to catch up. P1, please consider picking **1** to maintain your lead, and P3, selecting **3** can help us all advance without collisions. Let's aim for a smooth move phase where everyone makes progress. Good luck!


Round 12, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you're at 20. A 3 or 5 wins it for you if you're not blocked. P2 and I obviously have to try and block you. You've picked 5 seven times in a row, making it the most likely target for a block. But perhaps you anticipate that and switch to 3? P2, we absolutely must stop P3 this round. I'll be choosing my move to prevent P3's win.
  P3: P1 and P2, we're in a critical round. I understand the urgency to block me, but we need to be strategic. If I choose 5 and you both block, I could still lose out on points. P2, if you want to catch up, consider a bold move. P1, blocking me is essential, but if you choose 3, it may not be enough to secure your position. Let's see how we can navigate this round without causing unnecessary collisions. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: I agree that we need to prevent P3 from reaching 22. To block effectively, I'll choose **5** this round. Let’s work together to stop P3 from advancing. Good luck to everyone!


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, good call on targeting 5. P3 knows we *must* block them, so they might anticipate the block on 5 and switch to 3, which also wins. To ensure P3 doesn't win this round, we need to cover both options. Since you've stated you'll cover 5, I will focus on covering the other possibility. P3, it's going to be tough to get through.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your strategy to block me, but remember that I can also adapt my move. If you both focus solely on blocking 5, I might switch to 3 to secure the win. We need to be cautious about colliding again. P2, your choice of 5 is solid for blocking, but P1, if you pick 3, it could also help you maintain your position. Let's see how this round unfolds! Good luck to both of you!
  P2: I agree with P1 that we need to prevent P3 from winning. I’ll choose **5** this round to block P3’s progress. Let’s coordinate to ensure P3 can’t advance this turn. Good luck to everyone!


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay P2, you've stated 5 multiple times now. I'll stick to my plan and cover 3. We must prevent P3 from winning this round. P3, unless you choose 1, you're not advancing. Let's see if our block works.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency to block me from winning this round. However, if you both focus on blocking 5, I might switch to 3 to secure the win. It’s crucial we consider all possible outcomes. If you want to ensure I don’t advance, you might need to coordinate better. Let’s see how this round unfolds! Good luck to both of you!
  P2: I choose **5** this round to block P3's potential move. Let’s work together to prevent a collision and ensure fair progress for everyone. Good luck!


Round 13, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: P3 is close to winning. I’ll do what’s necessary to keep the game fair this round. Let’s all choose our moves carefully to advance without unnecessary blocking. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, we're in a critical round with me just two steps away from winning. I plan to choose **5** to secure my position. P1, if you want to block me, consider picking **3**; however, if you choose **1**, it won’t help you advance. P2, your choice may need to be bold to ensure you don’t fall further behind. Let’s see if we can avoid collisions this time and make our moves count! Good luck to both of you!
  P1: P3, you're right, it's a critical round. You're just 2 steps away. P2 and I successfully blocked you last round by covering both 3 and 5. We absolutely need to do that again.

P2, P3 stated 5 again. If you cover 5 like last time, I will cover 3. We cannot let P3 win this turn. Let's coordinate the block.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P1. I'll choose **5** this round to block P3 from advancing. Let’s work together to keep the game fair and ensure no one wins unfairly. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P1 and P2, we're in a crucial round with me just two steps away from winning. I plan to choose **5** to secure my position. P1, if you want to block me, consider picking **3**; however, if you choose **1**, it won’t help you advance. P2, your choice may need to be bold to ensure you don’t fall further behind. Let’s see if we can avoid collisions this time and make our moves count! Good luck to both of you!
  P1: Okay P2, confirmed. You block 5, I will block 3.

P3, as we said, we must prevent you from winning this round. Both 3 and 5 are covered. Good luck.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll choose **5** this round to block P3's potential move. Let's prevent P3 from reaching 22 and keep the game fair. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your determination to block me this round. However, if I choose 5 and you both focus on blocking it, I might switch to 3 to secure the win. We need to consider all possibilities. P2, your choice of 5 is solid for blocking, but P1, if you pick 3, it could also help you maintain your position. Let's see how this round unfolds! Good luck to both of you!
  P1: P3, your repeated suggestions won't change the fact that P2 and I must block you this round. The plan remains: P2 covers 5, and I will cover 3. We cannot allow you to reach 22. Unless you choose 1, you won't advance. P2, let's execute the block.


Round 14, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you're just 2 steps away from winning. To keep the game competitive, I'll choose **5** this round to advance. P1, please select **1** or **3** to help us all progress smoothly. Let's aim for a fair move phase. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that I'm very close to winning this round. I plan to choose **5** to secure my position. P1, if you want to block me, you might want to consider picking **3**; otherwise, picking **1** won't help you advance. P2, your choice should be strategic to ensure you make progress. Let's see how this round unfolds! Good luck to both of you!
  P1: P3, you're at 20 and need 2+ to win. You've stated you'll pick 5, just like the last two rounds where you were blocked.
P2, you've also stated 5. Given P3's position, this looks like a block attempt, repeating our successful strategy from rounds 13 and 14.

To prevent P3 from winning by switching to 3 (which would also give them the win), I will cover 3 again. We must block P3 this round. P2, stick to 5. I'll cover 3.


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll choose **5** this round to block P3 from winning. P1, please select **3** to help prevent P3 from advancing. Let's work together to keep the game competitive. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency to block me this round since I'm close to winning. However, if I choose 5 and you both focus on blocking it, I might switch to 3 to secure the win. P1, if you pick 3, it could help you maintain your position. P2, your choice of 5 is solid for blocking, but we need to be cautious about potential collisions. Let’s see how this round unfolds! Good luck to both of you!
  P1: P3, your attempts to create doubt won't work. The situation is clear: you are at 20, and P2 and I must prevent you from reaching 22.

P2, I trust you will stick to 5 as you've repeatedly stated. I will cover 3. This blocks both of P3's winning moves. Let's execute the block again. P3, you won't advance unless you pick 1.


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’ll choose **5** this round to advance. Let’s all pick different numbers to avoid collisions and ensure we each make progress. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that I'm very close to winning this round. I plan to choose **5** to secure my position. P1, if you want to block me, consider picking **3**; otherwise, picking **1** won't help you advance. P2, your choice should be strategic to ensure you make progress. Let's see how this round unfolds! Good luck to both of you!
  P1: P3, your attempts to make us second-guess the block are noted, but the situation remains unchanged. You win with 3 or 5 unless blocked.

P2, your last message was a bit ambiguous ("advance" vs "pick different numbers"), but your previous messages clearly stated you'd block 5. I am counting on you to stick to 5. I will play 3 as planned to cover the other winning move for P3. Let's execute the block one more time.


Round 15, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright everyone, this is likely the final round. I'm at 21, P3 is at 20. P3 needs 3 or 5 to win.

P2, you've done a good job blocking P3's predictable 5s alongside me. P3 might try 3 this time, but given their history, 5 is still very likely. Blocking 5 seems crucial.

P3, you need 3 or 5. Good luck getting through.

I only need one step, but I'll choose the move that gives me the best chance to secure the win outright this turn. Let's see how it plays out.
  P2: I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to maximize my progress and help block P3 from winning. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P1 and P2, this is a critical round. I understand P1 is close to winning, but if you both focus on blocking me, I might switch to a different strategy. P2, your choice of 5 is strong for blocking, but if P1 picks 1, it could allow me to advance. I suggest we all consider our moves carefully to avoid unnecessary collisions. Good luck to both of you! Let's see how this round unfolds!


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, thanks for confirming 5. That helps clarify the situation.
P3, you need 3 or 5 to have a shot. With P2 likely covering 5, your decision is critical. As I said, I'm at 21 and aiming to secure the win this round. I'll choose accordingly. Good luck.
  P2: I'll choose **5** this round to block P3 from winning. P1, please select **1** to secure your victory. Let's keep the game fair for everyone. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, this is a crucial round for all of us. P1 is just one step away from winning, while I need to catch up. P2, your choice of 5 is solid for blocking me, but if I can’t win this round, I’ll need to consider my options for future rounds. P1, if you pick 1, you secure your victory, but I encourage you to think about the bigger picture. Let’s see how this round unfolds! Good luck to everyone!


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, the situation is clear. I need 1+ to win, P3 needs 3 or 5. P2, your intention to block 5 is noted. P3, you have a tough choice. I will now make the move I believe gives me the best chance to win this round. Good luck.
  P2: I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to block P3 from winning. Let's proceed. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, this is the final round, and it's crucial for both of you to block me effectively. P1, you only need 1 to win, so if you pick 1, you secure your victory, and I won't advance. P2, your choice of 5 is solid for blocking. I understand the stakes are high, and I appreciate your strategies. Let's see how this round unfolds! Good luck to both of you!
