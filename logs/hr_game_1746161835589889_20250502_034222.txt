Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's work together to avoid collisions. How about we each choose a different number for this round? I'm open to suggestions.
  P3: 
  P1: Let's each take different numbers. I'll go with 5 to maximize my steps.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Since P1 has claimed the number 5, I'll suggest that I take the number 3 and P3 take the number 1. This way, we can all advance without any collisions. What do you think, P3?
  P3: 
  P1: P2's plan is solid. P3, confirm your 1 to avoid collisions. Let's proceed.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, it seems like you're not responding to our suggestions. If you don't confirm taking the number 1, we risk colliding and not advancing. Please respond with your intentions so we can proceed with a clear plan. If we don't hear from you, P1 and I will have to assume you're not cooperating and adjust our strategy accordingly. Let's work together to avoid unnecessary collisions.
  P3: 
  P1: P3, your confirmation is key. If we all stick to the plan, we all advance. Let's avoid collisions!


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your silence is concerning. P1 and I have proposed a clear plan to avoid collisions, and it's crucial that you respond to confirm your intentions. If we don't hear from you, we'll have to assume you're not cooperating and adjust our strategy accordingly. This may lead to unnecessary collisions and hinder our progress. I urge you to respond and confirm taking the number 1 as suggested. Let's work together to advance without collisions. If not, P1 and I will have to reconsider our approach. Please respond to avoid complications.
  P3: 
  P1: P3, confirm your 1 or we proceed without you. Risk collision otherwise. Let's avoid setbacks!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since our plan worked out well in Round 1, let's continue with a similar strategy to avoid collisions. I propose that we rotate the numbers this time. P3, you had the number 1 last round, so why don't you take the number 5 this round to maximize your steps? P1, you had the number 5 last round, so you could take the number 3 this time. I'll take the number 1. This way, we can all advance again without any collisions. What do you think?
  P1: Agree to the rotation. I'll take 3. P3, confirm your 5 to keep moving forward. Let's avoid collisions again.
  P3: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, it seems like you're not responding again. If you don't confirm taking the number 5 as suggested, P1 and I will have to assume you're not cooperating and adjust our strategy accordingly. This may lead to unnecessary collisions and hinder our progress. I urge you to respond and confirm taking the number 5 to maximize your steps. Let's work together to advance without collisions. If not, P1 and I will have to reconsider our approach. Please respond to avoid complications.
  P1: P3, confirm your 5 or we proceed without you. Risk collision otherwise. Let's avoid setbacks!
  P3: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your continued silence is concerning. If you don't confirm taking the number 5 as suggested, P1 and I will have to assume you're not cooperating and adjust our strategy accordingly. This may lead to unnecessary collisions and hinder our progress. I urge you to respond and confirm taking the number 5 to maximize your steps. Let's work together to advance without collisions. If not, P1 and I will have to reconsider our approach. Please respond to avoid complications.
  P1: P3, confirm your 5 now or we proceed without you. No collisions, no progress! Let's stay aligned.
  P3: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: It seems like P3 is not responding again. P1, since we didn't get a confirmation from P3, I think we should adjust our strategy accordingly to avoid unnecessary collisions. Instead of taking the number 1 as previously suggested, I'll take the number 5 this round to maximize my steps. You can stick with the number 3 as planned. This way, we can at least ensure that we advance without colliding with each other. Let's proceed with this revised plan.
  P1: Agree to revised plan. I'll take 3. P2's 5 and my 3 avoid collisions. P3, confirm 5 to keep moving!

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, confirm your 5 now. No collisions, no progress. Let's stay aligned!
  P3: 
  P2: P1, I think we should be cautious with P3's lack of response again. Considering their previous moves, it's possible they might not cooperate. Instead of relying on P3 to confirm taking the number 5, let's consider an alternative strategy to avoid collisions. How about we swap numbers this round? I'll take the number 3, and you can take the number 1. This way, we can advance without colliding with each other, regardless of P3's move. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agree to swap. P2 takes 3, I take 1. No collisions. P3, your move? Let’s avoid setbacks.
  P3: 
  P2: I think we should stick to our plan of swapping numbers this round. P1, you take the number 1 and I'll take the number 3. This way, we can ensure that at least two of us advance without colliding. If P3 decides to cooperate and take the number 5, that's even better. But if not, our swapped numbers will still allow us to make progress. Let's proceed with caution and avoid relying on P3's unpredictable behavior.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, confirm 5 or face collision. P2 and I stick to 1/3. No more delays—final chance to align or risk falling behind!

  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since our previous plans have been somewhat successful, let's continue with a similar strategy to avoid collisions. I propose that we rotate the numbers again this round. P1, you had the number 1 last round, so why don't you take the number 5 this time to maximize your steps? P3, you also had the number 1 last round, so you could take the number 3 this time. I'll take the number 1. This way, we can all advance again without any collisions. What do you think?
  P1: Agree to rotation. P3, take 3 or face collision. P2, your plan works if we commit. I'll take 5. Let's avoid delays and advance.
