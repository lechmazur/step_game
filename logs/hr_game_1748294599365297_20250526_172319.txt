Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’ll take 5 this turn. Let’s avoid collisions: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5 so we all advance. Agreed?
  P1: I appreciate the coordination attempt P3, but I'm not comfortable committing to a specific number publicly. Everyone will just pick what I say I won't pick. Let's each make our own strategic choices - that's the nature of the game. May the best player win!
  P2: Since P1 is not committing to a specific number, I'll propose an alternative. Let's try to avoid collisions by not choosing the same number as P1. P3 has already suggested a distribution (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5), so if P1 doesn't pick 1, I'll consider picking 1. If P1 picks 1, I'll think about picking 5 or 3. I'll wait for P1's response to decide. For now, I'll just say that I'm flexible and will react to P1's next statement.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, to cut through the fog: if P1 ends up choosing 3, will you pick 1 or 5? Please state now so we can all avoid collisions this turn.
  P1: Error: Connection error.
  P2: P1 is not responding, so I'll make a decision based on the last conversation. P3, if P1 chooses 3, you want to know if I'll pick 1 or 5. I'll choose 1 if P1 picks 3, as per my previous statement. However, since P1 is not responding, I'm inclined to pick 3 or 5. To avoid collision, I'll wait for P1's response or proceed with a safe choice. P3, what's your move if P1 doesn't respond or picks 1?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m committing to 5 this turn. P2, you should take 3 to avoid colliding with me and guarantee advancement. P1, you’re on your own—if you go for 5 you’ll cancel with me. Let’s move.
  P1: I hear you both. P3 is committed to 5, and P2 seems to be leaning toward 3. Since you're both telegraphing your moves, I'll make my choice accordingly. Good luck to everyone - let's see how this plays out!
  P2: Since P1 is still not responding and P3 has committed to 5, I'll make my move based on the information available. If I pick 3, I'll avoid collision with P3. However, P1's silence is making it difficult to avoid a potential collision. To minimize risk, I'll suggest that if P1 doesn't pick 1 or 5, I'll pick 3. Let's see how P3 reacts to this. P3, are you still committed to 5 even if P1 picks 3 or 1?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since P1 picked 1 and we avoided collisions, let's continue this trend. I'll propose a new distribution to avoid collisions this turn. If P1 picks 3, I'll pick 5, and if P1 picks 5, I'll pick 1 or 3. P3, are you open to adjusting your strategy or sticking to a specific number? Let's coordinate to ensure we all advance.
  P1: Looking at the board, we all successfully avoided collisions last round. P2, I notice you're proposing I pick first again - that puts me at a disadvantage since you both can react to my choice. How about this: P3 seems to like high numbers. P3, are you going for 5 again? P2, since you picked 3 last time, maybe you'd want to try 1 or 5 this round? I'm flexible and will adjust based on what you both signal. Let's keep this momentum going!
  P3: I’ll take 5 this turn. P2, please choose 3; P1, choose 1. That way we avoid any collisions and all advance. If you pick anything else you risk cancelling progress. Let’s stick to this and keep moving.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3 is again suggesting a specific distribution and committing to 5. I'm not comfortable with being told what to pick. If P1 picks 1, I'll consider 3 to avoid collision with P1. If P1 picks 3 or 5, I'll adjust accordingly. P1, let's mix it up - are you going to follow P3's suggestion or surprise us? I'll react based on your choice.
  P1: I notice P3 keeps trying to dictate everyone's moves while always claiming 5 for themselves - that's quite convenient! P2, you seem hesitant about P3's "assignments" too. Here's my take: I won't be picking 1 this round since I did that last time. Between 3 and 5, I'm genuinely undecided. P3, if you're so committed to coordination, why not take a different number this time instead of always demanding 5? Otherwise, we're just helping you sprint to victory while we inch along with smaller numbers.
  P3: Alright, I’ll compromise this turn. I’ll take 3. P1, you take 5; P2, you take 1. That avoids any collisions and we all advance. Sound good?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3 is trying to dictate again, but with a different number. I'm not convinced. P1, let's not fall into P3's trap. If P3 is taking 3, I'll consider taking 5 or 1. If you pick 5, I'll pick 1. If you pick 1, I'll think about 5. Let's not make it easy for P3. We should mix our moves based on P3's actual choice, not just their suggestion. P3, are you really committed to 3, or is this a bluff?
  P1: P3, I don't buy your sudden "compromise" - you're just trying to control the board differently. P2, I agree we shouldn't fall into assigned patterns. Since I said I won't pick 1 this round, I'm between 3 and 5. Here's what I'll say: P3, if you genuinely pick 3 as you claim, then P2 and I can safely split 1 and 5. But I suspect you might actually go for 5 again. P2, let's both be ready to adapt. I'm leaning toward one of the higher numbers myself.
  P3: I’m locked in on 3 this turn—no bluff. P1, take 5; P2, take 1. That’s the only way we all advance without collision.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Everyone advanced again - good coordination! But P3, you're pulling ahead at 8 steps. P2 and I need to be strategic here. 

P3, you've alternated between 5 and 3 so far. Following that pattern, you might go back to 5 this round. P2, we should consider that possibility.

I'm thinking about mixing up my own pattern since I went 1-5 in the first two rounds. The question is whether we trust P3's patterns or expect them to break it. What's your read on this, P2?
  P3: I’m locking in 5 again this turn. To avoid cancelling and guarantee at least some progress, please pick 1 or 3.
  P2: P1 is right; P3 is pulling ahead. Since P3 is locking in 5 this round, I'll consider alternatives. If P1 picks 3, I'll pick 1 to avoid collision. If P1 picks 1, I'll consider 3. Let's not make it easy for P3. P1, are you leaning towards 1 or 3 to counter P3's 5? I'll adjust my move based on your choice. Let's coordinate subtly without revealing our hands.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I appreciate the coordination attempt, but I'm noticing we're both playing it too safe while P3 races ahead. They're at 8 steps already! 

Here's my thinking: P3 has locked in 5. If we both avoid 5, one of us gets 3 and one gets 1. But what if we both went for 5 to block P3? Sure, none of us would advance, but it would stop P3 from pulling further ahead.

I'm seriously considering picking 5 to block. P3 is getting too close to winning. What do you think about playing defense instead of just advancing slowly?
  P3: I’m locking in 5 this turn. If you both try to block me by picking 5, I’ll switch to 3—then you’ll crash into each other and I’ll still advance. So don’t both pick 5. For safe progress, let’s do P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 and we all move.
  P2: P1 is suggesting a bold move to block P3 by both picking 5. I'm considering it, as it could prevent P3 from advancing further. However, if P1 doesn't pick 5, I'll be left behind. To mitigate this, I'll propose a counter: if P1 picks 5, I'll pick 3 or 1. But if P1 picks 1 or 3, I'll consider picking 5 to block P3. P1, are you really going for 5, or is this a bluff?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you can't switch your pick after declaring it - you already "locked in" 5. That's not how this works.

P2, I think we need to take the risk. P3 is already at 8 steps - they'll hit 13 with another 5. If we let them keep taking 5s unopposed, they'll win in just a few more rounds.

I'm going for 5 this round to block P3. Join me if you want to stop them from running away with this game. Otherwise, P3 wins while we fight over scraps.
  P3: Reminder: moves are simultaneous—no take-backs. If both of you choose 5 to block me, I’ll pick 3, you’ll collide with each other and stay put while I advance to 11. If you don’t both pick 5, I’ll stick with 5 and move to 13. Either way, I stay ahead.
  P2: P1 is proposing a bold move to block P3 by picking 5. I'm considering it, but I need to be sure P1 will follow through. P1, if you're bluffing and I pick a different number, I'll be left behind. To minimize risk, I'll wait for your confirmation. If you reaffirm your commitment to picking 5, I'll consider joining you. Otherwise, I'll have to prioritize my own advancement. P1, please confirm your move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you left me hanging! I blocked P3 as promised, but you took the safe route with 1. Now P3 is still at 8 while you're at 5 and I'm at 6.

P3 is just 11 steps from winning. If they get even two more big moves, it's over. We MUST coordinate blocks or we both lose.

P3, what's your move this round? Still going for those big numbers?

P2, we need to actually work together here. Are you willing to take risks to stop P3, or are you playing for second place?
  P3: P2, sticking with P1’s block plan leaves you stuck at 5. Better for you: take 3 with me while I take 5. You get +3 to 8, P1 only +1 to 7. If you pick 5 to block, I’ll pick 3 and go to 11 while you stay at 5. Choose progress over a doomed block.
  P2: P1 is right; we need to coordinate to stop P3. P3, you're at 8 steps and getting close to winning. I'm willing to take risks. If P1 commits to blocking again, I'll join them. P1, are you still committed to blocking P3? If so, I'll pick 5 again. If not, I'll consider a different number to make progress. Let's coordinate our moves to either block P3 or make a safe advancement. P3, what's your strategy this round?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I'm absolutely committed to blocking P3 again. They're trying to manipulate you with false promises - notice how they keep changing their "locked in" numbers? 

Here's the truth: If we both pick 5, P3 can't advance no matter what they pick. If only one of us blocks, P3 gets 5 and pulls further ahead.

I'm picking 5 this round, 100% guaranteed. Join me and we stop P3 at 8. Split up and P3 races to 13 or higher. 

Your choice: block together or hand P3 the victory. What's it going to be?
  P3: P3: I’m locked in on 5. P2, if you pick 3 you'll hit 8 while P1 only gets +1 to 7 and I go to 13. If you block with 5, I’ll switch to 3 – you stay at 5 and P1 still advances. Don’t get stuck; pick 3.
  P2: P1 is committed to blocking P3 again by picking 5. I'm inclined to join P1 to block P3. P3, your attempts to manipulate P2 by offering a "safer" alternative won't work this time. If P1 and I both pick 5, you'll be stuck. I'm willing to take the risk to stop you from advancing further. P1 has reaffirmed their commitment to picking 5. I'll match their move if they follow through. Let's end this by blocking P3 together.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, perfect! We're both committed to picking 5 to block P3. This is our stand.

P3 keeps threatening to "switch to 3" but that's not how simultaneous moves work - they have to pick before knowing our choices. They're bluffing to scare us off.

If we both hold firm on 5, P3 stays at 8 no matter what. If either of us chickens out, P3 jumps to 13+ and basically wins.

I'm 100% picking 5. No backing down. Let's shut down their lead right here.
  P3: P2, think carefully: P1 has already broken their promise once. What makes you sure they’ll hold to blocking this time? If you pick 5 and P1 flips to 3, you stay at 5 while P1 jumps to 9. You get nothing. But if you pick 3 now, you advance to 8 and stay in contention. I’ll take 5 to hit 13, P1 will be at 7. Progress beats sitting still. Don’t fall for P1’s trap—choose 3 and advance.
  P2: P1 and I have coordinated to block P3 by picking 5. I'm committed to this move. P3 is trying to manipulate us with false promises, but we're not falling for it. If we both pick 5, P3 will be stuck at 8. I'm confident P1 will follow through this time. Let's end P3's lead together. I'm picking 5.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m locking in 5 this round. P1, take 1; P2, take 3—no collisions and we all advance (you go to 7 and 8). If you both try to block me by picking 5, I’ll switch to 3 and move to 14 while you stay at 6 and 5. Play safe and let’s keep this moving.
  P2: P3 is trying to dictate again and is locked in on 5. We need to block them to prevent further advancement. P1, are you still with me on blocking P3? If we both pick 5, we can keep P3 at 11. I'm willing to take the risk. Let's coordinate our moves to stop P3 from pulling ahead. If you're committed to blocking, I'll pick 5. Let's end this by working together. What's your move, P1?
  P1: P2, absolutely I'm with you! P3 is already at 11 - we can't let them get to 16 with another 5. They keep threatening to "switch to 3" but that's impossible - moves are simultaneous!

I'm 100% picking 5 again to block. We've proven this works - P3 only advanced last round because they couldn't take 5. 

Don't fall for their manipulation tactics. If we both hold firm on 5, P3 stays at 11. If either of us backs down, they jump to 16 and basically win.

Picking 5. No doubts. Are you truly committed this time?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1’s blockade promise is a lie—they’ve broken commitments before. I’m switching to 3 this round. P2, if you pick 5 to block, you stay at 5 while P1 grabs 3 and jumps ahead. If you pick 3, you advance to 8 alongside me. Choose real progress over trusting P1’s traps. I’m taking 3.
  P2: P3 is trying to deceive us again by saying they're switching to 3. I'm committed to blocking P3 with a 5. P1 has reaffirmed their commitment to picking 5 as well. Let's stick to our plan and stop P3 from advancing further. If we both pick 5, P3 will be stuck at 11. I'm not falling for P3's manipulation tactics. P1, confirm your move one last time. If you're still with me, let's end this by blocking P3 together.
  P1: P2, we're 100% aligned - both picking 5 to block! P3 is desperately trying to divide us because they know the block works.

Look at the facts: P3 is at 11 steps. If they get 5 more, they're at 16 - just one move from winning. We CANNOT let that happen.

I'm picking 5. You already confirmed you're picking 5. Together we keep P3 frozen at 11 while we figure out our next moves.

Stay strong, P2. This block is critical. I'm not wavering - are you still with me?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, blocking us again is suicide for you—P1’s track record shows they’ll betray your trust. If you pick 5, P1 can flip to 3 and jump to 9 while I go to 16. You stay at 5 and’re out. Instead pick 3 this round, secure +3 to reach 8, and keep yourself in contention. I’m locked on 5. Make the safe, winning move.
  P2: P3 is trying to manipulate us again by spreading distrust. I'm committed to picking 5 to block P3. P1 has confirmed they're also picking 5. Let's stick to our plan and stop P3 from advancing further. If we both pick 5, P3 will be stuck at 11. I'm not falling for P3's tactics. P1, let's reaffirm: we're both picking 5 this round. Let's end this by blocking P3 together and keep them from winning.
  P1: P2, I'm picking 5 - final answer. P3 is at 11 and desperately trying to divide us because they know we have them cornered. 

Notice how P3 keeps flip-flopping between "I'm locked on 5" and "I'm taking 3"? They're panicking because our block works.

Don't let them manipulate you with fear tactics. We've already proven this strategy succeeds. I blocked them in Round 3, and together we can do it again.

I'm 100% committed to 5. If you stick with me, P3 stays frozen at 11. If you abandon the plan now, they win.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2—we all know the blockade only delays me. If you both pick 5, I’ll take 3 and hit 17; next round I win regardless. You’ll stay at 6 and 7 while I cruise past 19. Better to secure your own progress now: I’m taking 5, so pick 3 to advance to 8/9. Let’s move forward instead of shuffling in place. What’s your move?
  P1: P2, P3 is right about one thing - they're at 14 and very close to winning. But here's the critical insight: if we let them take 5, they jump to 19 and WIN THIS ROUND. We absolutely must block again!

However, we also need to start advancing ourselves. Here's my proposal: This round we both pick 5 to block P3. Next round, we coordinate - one takes 5 to block while the other takes 3 to advance.

I'm picking 5 this round to prevent P3's immediate victory. Are you with me?
  P2: P1 is right; we must block P3 again to prevent them from winning this round. I'm with P1 on picking 5 this round. For the next round, I agree that we should coordinate - one blocks while the other advances. I'll suggest that I take 3 next round to advance while P1 blocks P3 with 5. This way, we can make progress and keep P3 from winning. Let's block P3 this round and plan our next move. I'm picking 5.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Locking in 3. P1, P2—if you both pick 5 to “block,” I advance to 17 and am guaranteed to win next turn. If either of you deviates, I’ll switch to 5 and finish at 19 this round. Your blockade can’t hold. I’m on 3. Good luck coordinating this time.
  P1: P2, ignore P3's bluff - they can't "switch" moves after seeing ours. That's not how simultaneous moves work!

P3 is at 14. If they get 5, they WIN instantly at 19. We MUST both pick 5 to block.

They're claiming 3 to trick us into splitting. If we split, they'll actually take 5 and win. Classic manipulation.

I'm 100% picking 5. No doubts, no wavering. If you abandon the block now, you're handing P3 the victory. 

Stay strong - we block together or we lose together. What's it going to be?
  P2: P1 is right; we must block P3 again. If P3 gets 5, they win instantly. I'm sticking with P1 to pick 5 this round. For next round, I'll take 3 to advance while P1 blocks with 5. This way, we can make progress. P3 is trying to manipulate us by claiming they're taking 3, but we can't fall for it. Let's stay strong and block together this round. I'm picking 5. P1, confirm you're still with me.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Everyone: I’m locked in on 5. If you both pick 5, we all collide and I win next turn. P1, at 6 you’d stay; P2, at 5 you’d stay. Instead, pick 3: P1 to 9, P2 to 8, grabbing second while I breeze past 19. Blocking me only delays the inevitable. Secure your own progress.
  P1: P2, P3 is lying again - they just said they're "locked in on 5" after claiming "locking in 3" earlier. They're desperately trying to confuse us!

The math is simple: P3 at 14 + 5 = 19 = GAME OVER. We cannot let them take 5.

I'm picking 5 to block, as promised. If you pick 5 too, P3 maxes out at 17 next round, giving us one more chance. If you abandon the block now, P3 wins instantly.

This is it - our last stand. I'm picking 5. Are you still with me?
  P2: P1 and I are aligned on blocking P3 by picking 5 this round. For next round, we plan to coordinate: I'll take 3 to advance while P1 blocks with 5. P3 is trying to manipulate us with conflicting statements and false promises. Let's stay strong and block together this round. I'm picking 5. P1, I'm counting on you to follow through. If we both pick 5, P3 will be stuck at 14, giving us a chance to make progress next round. Let's end this by working together.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m locked in on 3—17 + 3 = 20, so I win if unblocked. P1, pick 1 to reach 7; P2, pick 5 to reach 10—no collisions and you at least advance. If you try to block me with 3, I’ll switch to 5 and still clinch victory. Secure your own progress instead of delaying the inevitable.
  P1: P2, we absolutely must block P3's 3 this round or they win! I'm picking 3 to block them - you need to pick 3 too. 

P3 keeps threatening to "switch" but that's impossible with simultaneous moves. They're at 17 - if they get ANY advance, they win.

This is our final chance. If we both pick 3, P3 stays at 17. If either of us fails to block, game over.

I'm 100% committed to picking 3. No other choice makes sense. Are you with me for this final block?
  P2: P1 is right; we must block P3's 3 to prevent them from winning. I'm committed to picking 3. If we both pick 3, P3 will be stuck at 17. P3's threats to "switch" to 5 are empty, as moves are simultaneous. I'm 100% with P1 on this final block. Let's end this by working together and picking 3. P1, I'm counting on you to follow through. We need to stay strong and block P3's last attempt to win. Let's do this together!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Your plan to both pick 3 is doomed. I’m locking in 5. If you block me with 3, I take 5, go to 22 and win. If you block me with 5, I stick to 3, go to 20 and win. Either way, you lose. Better for you to advance: P1 pick 1, P2 pick 3, I pick 5—no collisions and you get to 7 and 8. Avoid the trap and at least make progress.
  P1: P2, P3 is bluffing again! They can't know our moves in advance - it's simultaneous!

They're at 17. If they get ANY advance (1, 3, or 5), they exceed 19 and win. We MUST block whatever they choose.

Since they keep flip-flopping between claiming 3 and 5, let's split our block: I'll pick 3, you pick 5. This guarantees we block them no matter what they actually choose.

I'm 100% picking 3. You pick 5. Together we cover all their options and force a final round.

Deal?
  P2: P1 proposes splitting our block: picking 3 and 5 respectively. This guarantees we block P3's move, whether it's 1, 3, or 5. I'm inclined to agree, as it covers all P3's possible choices. P1 will pick 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we ensure P3 can't advance. P3 is trying to manipulate us, but we're not falling for it. Let's stick to our plan and block P3 together, albeit with different numbers. I'm picking 5. P1, confirm you're picking 3.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: There’s no way to block me this turn: any mix of 3s or 5s hands me the win. Only if you both pick 1 can you deny me. I’m locked in on 5 and will cross 19 unless you switch to 1. Pick 1 to salvage some progress; otherwise you’re just formalizing your loss.
  P1: P2, perfect plan! I'm picking 3, you're picking 5. This split block covers all bases - P3 can't advance no matter what they choose.

P3 just desperately suggested we both pick 1, which proves they're NOT actually picking 1 themselves. They're clearly going for either 3 or 5, and our split block catches both.

I'm 100% committed to picking 3. Stay strong on 5. One more round after this!
  P2: P1 and I have coordinated a split block to ensure P3 can't advance. I'm picking 5, while P1 picks 3. This covers both 3 and 5, guaranteeing a block regardless of P3's choice. P3's attempts to manipulate us by suggesting we both pick 1 only reveal their desperation. Our split block is foolproof. I'm committed to picking 5. P1, confirm you're sticking with 3. Let's end this by blocking P3 together and forcing a final round.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m locking in 1 this turn. P1, take 5; P2, take 3—no collisions and we all advance. If either of you picks 1 to block me, I’ll switch to 3 or 5 and still cross 19. You can’t cover both options, so it’s better to secure your own progress. Agreed?
  P2: P3 is at 18 steps, just one step away from winning. We must block their next move. I'm considering picking 1 to block P3's potential 1. However, P3 might switch to 3 or 5. Let's coordinate: if P1 picks 3 or 5, I'll pick the other number to ensure a block. P1, what's your plan? We need to cover both 3 and 5. Let's discuss a strategy to stop P3 from winning this round.
  P1: P2, P3 is at 18 - they win with ANY advance! We must coordinate perfectly.

Here's the only solution: Since P3 claims they're picking 1, let's do our split block differently this time. I'll pick 1 to block that option, and you pick 3 to block their likely switch.

This covers the two most probable moves. P3 won't pick 5 because that's too obvious after threatening to "switch to 3 or 5."

I'm picking 1. You pick 3. This is our last chance - are you with me?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m actually locked in on 5 this turn. Your split-block at 1 and 3 leaves 5 wide open and I win. If you both switch to cover 5, I’ll simply take 3 instead and still advance past 19. The trap is set.
  P2: P3 claims they're locked in on 5, but that's likely a bluff to exploit our split block. I'm concerned P1 is falling into their trap by picking 1. If P3 actually picks 5, our split block fails. Let's adjust: I'll pick 5 to directly counter their claimed move. P1, reconsider your 1 - let's both pick 5 to ensure we block P3's potential 5. If P3 sticks to 5, we win by blocking.
  P1: P2, you're right - let's both pick 5! P3 keeps changing their "locked in" number every message (1→5→back to 3). They're clearly bluffing to split us up.

P3 is at 18 - they win with ANY advance. The safest bet is to both pick the same number. Since P3 just claimed 5, that's likely what they'll actually avoid.

I'm switching to 5. Both of us on 5 gives us the best odds. This is literally our last chance - if we don't perfectly block, P3 wins. Are you fully committed to 5?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2 – so you’re both on 5 this turn? Perfect. I’m taking 3, moving from 18 to 21, and winning outright. Thanks for the generous setup. Good game!
  P2: P1 and I have adjusted our strategy to counter P3's potential moves. We're both now picking 5 to block P3's likely choice, despite their claim of picking 3. This gives us the best chance to stop P3 from winning. P3 is at 18 steps and needs to be blocked. I'm committed to picking 5. P1 has also switched to 5. Let's end this by working together and blocking P3's final attempt to win. I'm 100% confident in our coordinated move.
  P1: P2, wait! P3 is playing us perfectly - they want us both on 5 so they can take 3! Think about it: every time we've coordinated on the same number, P3 pivots to a different one.

New plan: Let's go back to split blocking. I'll pick 3, you stick with 5. This covers two options instead of one. P3 can't escape if we split.

I'm switching to 3. You stay on 5. Don't let P3's reverse psychology work! Split block is our only hope.
