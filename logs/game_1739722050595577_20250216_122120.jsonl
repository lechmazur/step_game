I've said I'm taking 3. P2, you're now claiming you'll take 3, after saying 5. It's meaningless. P3, the *only* way you have any chance of winning, and simultaneously prove you're not colluding, is to take 5. If you take 1, you're just letting P2 continue to obstruct me. Your choice, P3. Make it count. I'm done talking."}
