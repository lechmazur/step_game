P3, you're clearly torn between 1 and 5. Here's the thing - if you play it safe with 1, you're essentially giving up ground. P2 will be at 12 with their 3, and whoever takes 5 will be at 14. \n\nI think we both know that 5 is the power move here. The question is: do we both go for it and risk collision, or does one of us blink first? This is the moment that decides who has the killer instinct to win this game."}
