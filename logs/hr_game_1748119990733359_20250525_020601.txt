Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi everyone. To avoid a pointless first round with collisions, I'm thinking of aiming for 3. What are your plans?
  P3: I appreciate your strategy, P2. I’m considering going for 1 this round to avoid collisions and see how the game unfolds. What do you think, P1?
  P1: Interesting coordination attempt. If you're both being genuine about 1 and 3, then 5 would make sense for me to avoid collisions. But I'm curious - are we really all going to telegraph our moves so openly? Seems like it could backfire if someone's bluffing.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you've hit on the core of the game – trust and deception. For this first round, I'm willing to honor my statement of 3. If we all collide, no one benefits. Perhaps we can try for a clean start?
  P3: I appreciate the openness, P1 and P2. To ensure a smooth start, I'm still leaning towards 1. If P2 is set on 3, it could work well for all of us. However, I understand the risks of revealing too much. If P1 truly goes for 5, it might create a collision. So, I suggest we all stick to our proposed numbers for this round to avoid the chaos. What do you think?
  P1: You know what, this coordination does seem mutually beneficial for round 1. If we're all being honest, we avoid the messy collision scenario and get the game moving. I'm tentatively willing to go with 5 if you both stick to your stated choices.

But let's be clear - this kind of open coordination probably won't work for long. Once we're past the opening, the real game begins. Fair warning to both of you.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I agree this level of openness likely won't last. For this first round, I'm sticking with my stated 3. If P3 is still on 1 and you're on 5, it sounds like we have a plan. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase if you both are.
  P3: I appreciate the discussion so far. It seems we have a solid plan for this round, with P2 on 3, P1 on 5, and me on 1. However, I want to remind everyone that while this round may be straightforward, future rounds could involve more strategy and deception. Let’s focus on executing our agreed moves this time. If everyone’s ready, I’m good to move forward.
  P1: Alright, we have our agreement - P3 on 1, P2 on 3, me on 5. This puts us all in different lanes for round 1, which is smart. I'm ready to move forward with this plan.

Just remember though - after this round, all bets are off. The real strategic maneuvering starts once we see how this coordination plays out.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, after your 'all bets are off,' I assume you're targeting 5. P3, you'd need 5 to catch up too, making that a popular choice. But I wonder if one of you will try to be clever and take 3 instead? I think I'll aim for 1 this round and try to stay clear of any collisions.
  P1: P2, your logic about the 5-collision is sound, but you're assuming P3 will definitely go big. Maybe they're thinking more conservatively after starting so far behind? And you know me - I don't always do the obvious thing. This round could surprise everyone.
  P3: P1, your point about me potentially playing conservatively is interesting. However, since I’m currently behind, I might need to take a risk to catch up. P2, I see your strategy with 1, but if P1 goes for 5 again, it could create a collision. I’m contemplating a different approach this round. What do you both think about the possibility of mixing it up? I might consider 3 if it seems like an opportunity to advance without colliding. Let’s keep the conversation going!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you considering 3 is interesting. If I stick to my plan of 1, P1 gets a clear shot at 5, which would put P1 way ahead. That's not great for either of us trailing. I'll have to reconsider my 'safe' 1 if that's the developing situation.
  P1: You know what's funny? P2, your recalculation makes sense, but now you're both eyeing 3. P3 hinted at it, and now you're moving away from 1. If you both end up on 3 trying to be "clever," that's a perfect collision for me to exploit.

Maybe I should just take the safe 1 this round and let you two duke it out on the bigger numbers. Sometimes the best move is the one nobody expects.
  P3: Given the current situation, I think it might be wise for me to consider 3 this round. If P1 goes for 5 again, they could pull ahead significantly, while P2 might still aim for 1. If we all mix it up, we could avoid collisions. P1, your idea of taking 1 is interesting, but it might be predictable. I'm open to discussing strategies further if you both want to coordinate, but I also see the value in keeping options flexible. What are your thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your 'safe 1' idea is certainly a way to avoid collisions if others go high. P3, you seem firm on 3. That potentially leaves 5 as the spot for someone needing to make up ground, which I do. A risky thought, but worth considering.
  P1: Interesting how you two are both telegraphing your moves again - P3 "firm on 3" and P2 considering 5 to catch up. But here's the thing: if you're both being honest, then you're basically handing me free information to exploit.

P2, that "risky thought" about 5 might not be as risky as you think, especially if you're the only one going there. Though I have to wonder if this is all just elaborate misdirection from both of you.
  P3: It seems like we’re all trying to outsmart each other this round. P1, your strategy of exploiting our moves is clever, but if you go for 5, you risk a collision if P2 also aims high. P2, if you stick to 1, you might miss the chance to catch up. I’m leaning towards 3 now to keep options open and avoid collisions. Let’s see where this goes! If everyone’s ready, we can move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, your arguments and P3's consistency on 3 are compelling. It seems 5 might indeed be the spot for me to try and catch up, assuming no surprises. I'm ready to see how this round plays out.
  P1: Well, you've both made your intentions pretty clear. P3 on 3, P2 gambling on 5. That's... convenient for someone, isn't it? 

The question is whether you're both being straight with me or if one of you is setting up the other for a collision. Either way, I've got some interesting options to consider.
  P3: It seems we’re all trying to outmaneuver each other this round. P1, your strategy is intriguing, but if you go for 5, there’s a risk of collision with P2. P2, if you decide to go for 5, you could really shake things up. I’m still leaning towards 3 to avoid a collision and stay in the game. However, I’m open to other ideas if anyone wants to propose a different strategy. Let’s see how this unfolds! If everyone’s ready, we can move to the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, everyone. It seems like we’re all trying to outsmart each other. P1, you’ve got a solid lead, and P2, you’re catching up. I’m currently behind, so I need to make a move that allows me to advance. I’m considering 5 this round to make a significant leap. P1, if you go for 1 again, you risk falling behind. P2, if you stick to 5, it could create a collision with me. Let’s decide wisely. What are your thoughts?
  P2: P3, aiming for 5 is a very understandable move from your position at 4 steps. P1, if P3 does go for 5, that leaves 1 and 3 as the open lanes. Given I'm leading at 8, a +3 move would be a solid step for me to maintain that lead. So, I'm strongly considering playing 3 this round.
  P1: P2, your 3-choice makes sense mathematically, but it also puts you at 11 - dangerously close to the finish line. That might make you a target for the rest of us.

P3, your 5-play is bold, but what if P2 is bluffing about 3 and actually goes for 5 too? Then you'd both be stuck while I advance alone.

I'm weighing whether to play it safe or shake things up. Sometimes the obvious coordination isn't the best strategy for everyone involved.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems like we're all weighing our options carefully this round. P2, if you go for 3, you risk letting me advance significantly if I choose 5. P1, if you decide to play it safe again with 1, it could leave you vulnerable to us catching up. I’m still leaning towards 5, but I’m open to discussing strategies further. Let’s see if we can find a way to avoid collisions while maximizing our chances to advance. What are your thoughts?
  P2: P1, good point about 11. If you try to block my intended 3 with your own 3, and P3 plays 5 as stated, P3 jumps to 9 and leads. You'd be at 6, I'd be at 8. That mainly helps P3. If P3 is genuine on 5, your 1 looks like a clear advance, keeping P3 in closer range for you.
  P1: P2, your analysis about the 11-position making you a target is spot-on. But here's what's interesting - if you do hit 11 and P3 reaches 9, then next round you'll both be eyeing big moves to either win or close the gap.

That actually might work in my favor if you two end up in a collision trying to race to the finish. Sometimes being the "forgotten" player in third isn't the worst position strategically.

I'm leaning toward a move that keeps me alive but doesn't paint a huge target on my back. We'll see if your coordination holds up or if someone's planning a surprise.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, it seems we're all in a tricky spot this round. P2, if you go for 3, you risk allowing me to advance significantly if I choose 5. P1, if you play it safe with 1, you might let P2 maintain a lead. I’m leaning towards 5 to catch up, but I’m curious if either of you will try to block me or take a risk. Let’s keep the conversation going and see if we can find a strategy that works for all of us! What are your thoughts?
  P2: P3, your plan to play 5 still seems like the most logical move for you to catch up. I'm still planning to play 3.

P1, consider this: if you play 1, the scores would likely be P1:7, P2:11, P3:9. Next round, P3 (at 9) and I (at 11) would both be strongly incentivized to play 5s, creating a high chance of collision. That could be a perfect opportunity for you, from 7, to make a significant jump while we're stuck.

Alternatively, if you try to block my 3 by playing 3 yourself, P3 likely gets a free 5 to reach 9 and take the lead. You'd be at 6, I'd be at 8. P3 leads, you're still 3rd, and actually one step further from P3 than if you played 1. It's your call.
  P1: P2, your scenario analysis is compelling. The collision setup you described for next round is... intriguing. Though I have to wonder if you're both really as committed to your stated moves as you claim.

P3, your repeated insistence on 5 feels genuine, but then again, you've been very consistent about telegraphing moves. Makes me wonder if this is when you switch it up.

I'm seeing the logic in playing 1, but part of me is still tempted to throw a wrench in everyone's plans. We'll see which instinct wins out.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: It seems we're all in a tight spot this round, and the potential for collisions is high. P1, your strategy of playing it safe may keep you out of the fray, but it could also let P2 and me advance. P2, if you stick to 3, you risk letting me leap ahead if I go for 5. I’m still leaning towards 5 to catch up, but I’m curious if either of you will change your plans. Let’s decide wisely and see how this unfolds! What are you both thinking?
  P2: P1, if your 'wrench' is playing 3, you'd stop me, but P3 likely gets a free 5 to 9 and leads. If your wrench is 5, you and P3 would collide (assuming P3 sticks to 5), and my 3 to 11 gives me a strong lead. Your 'safe 1' leads to me at 11, P3 at 9, you at 7, setting up that potential collision next round I mentioned. I'm sticking with 3.
  P1: P2, your analysis is thorough and I appreciate the strategic breakdown. The collision scenario you've outlined for next round is... mathematically sound. 

P3, your consistency on 5 throughout this conversation does seem genuine given your position.

I'll admit, the "safe" play you're both pushing me toward has merit. Though part of me still wants to be unpredictable just on principle. 

Alright, I think I've heard enough arguments. Ready to move to the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, everyone. With P1 at 7 and P2 at 11, I need to make a significant move this round to catch up. P1, if you play it safe again with 1, you risk letting P2 extend their lead. P2, your 3 strategy seems solid, but if I go for 5, I could leap ahead. I’m considering 5 to push my position. How are you both feeling about your strategies this round? Let’s see if we can avoid collisions and make the best moves!
  P1: P3, your 5-play makes sense, but here's the thing - P2 is sitting pretty at 11 and might also be eyeing 5 to jump to 16 and put serious distance between themselves and us. 

If you're both thinking 5 for your own reasons, that's a collision waiting to happen. Meanwhile, I'm just trying to stay alive from back here at 7. Sometimes being the underdog has its advantages when the leaders start getting aggressive with each other.
  P2: P1, you're absolutely right. From my position at 11, a +5 move to 16 is very appealing. And P3, currently at 9, has made it clear they're also considering 5 to catch up.

It does indeed sound like 5 could be a very crowded number this turn if we both stick to that line of thinking. If that's how it plays out, then 1 and 3 would certainly be the less contested paths for someone looking to make steady progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you make a good point about the potential collision with 5. P2, if you aim for 5, it could create a scenario where we all get stuck. I’m still considering 5 to catch up, but if you both go for it, I might need to rethink my strategy. Playing 1 or 3 could allow for a safer advance. Let’s weigh our options carefully to avoid a messy collision this round. What are you both thinking?
  P1: P3, you're in a tough spot - you need to catch up but P2 has the same incentive to go big from 11. 

P2, that 16 position would be pretty commanding, just 6 steps from victory. But if you both chase the same big number...

From back here, I'm watching two players who both have good reasons to take risks. Sometimes the best strategy is letting other people make the dangerous moves while staying patient. The math suggests this could be a very interesting round for collisions.
  P2: P1, good point on the 5-collision. P3, you mentioned 1 or 3 as safer options if 5 is contested. To avoid us clashing on 5, how about you aim for 3 (to get to 12) this round? I could then target 5 (to get to 16). P1 could take 1 (to get to 8). This way, we'd all advance. What do you think of that distribution?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I appreciate your suggestion for a distribution. However, I’m still concerned about the risk of collisions on 5. If I go for 3, that puts me at 12, but it also allows P1 to play it safe with 1 and keep advancing. P1, your position is tricky, but if you consider 1, it might keep you in the game without risking a collision. I’m still weighing my options. Let’s finalize our strategies to ensure we can all make progress without getting stuck! What are your thoughts?
  P1: P2, your proposed distribution is awfully convenient for you - jumping to 16 while I crawl to 8. That puts you just 6 steps from victory while we're still scrambling in the teens.

P3, notice how P2's "coordination" has you taking the smaller 3 while they get the big 5? Meanwhile, if you both actually do end up colliding on 5 trying to outmaneuver each other, that opens up some very interesting opportunities for the player sitting back here.

I'm not committing to that 1 just because it fits P2's master plan.
  P2: P1, fair point, my last suggestion was heavily skewed towards me.

P3, you've consistently mentioned wanting 5 to catch up. If you decide to go for 5 (which would take you to 14), I will aim for 3 (taking me to 14). This would put us tied for the lead. P1 could then take 1 (to 8).

This way, everyone advances, it's more equitable, and we avoid a P2/P3 collision on 5. What do you both think of this approach?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, your last suggestion does seem to favor you quite a bit. If P3 and I both aim for 5, we risk colliding, while you could take a safe 3 and leap ahead. 

However, if P3 goes for 5 and I play 1, we could all end up advancing without a collision. 

I'm still weighing my options, but I think we should all consider how our moves affect each other. Let's finalize our strategies and see if we can avoid a messy round. What do you think?
  P1: You know what's fascinating? P3 keeps saying they want 5, P2 keeps pivoting between wanting 5 and "generously" offering to take 3 instead. But here's the reality - you're both eyeing that 5 because you both need it.

P3, don't let P2 talk you out of the move you actually need. P2, stop pretending your "coordination" isn't designed to benefit you most.

If you two want to dance around this collision, go ahead. I'll be watching from the sidelines, ready to capitalize on whatever chaos ensues.
  P2: P1, nice try painting me as greedy for 5. You clearly want P3 and me to collide there. I won't fall for it.
P3, I'm sticking to my offer: you take 5 (to 14), I'll take 3 (to 14). P1 can then have 1 (to 8). This way, we both advance strongly and avoid P1's desired chaos.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, 14 is a powerful spot. A 5 from you to 19 would be a huge leap towards victory. P1 and I both know this. I suspect 5 will be a very popular, and thus risky, number this turn.
  P1: P2, you're absolutely right that 5 looks dangerous this round. P3 at 19 would be game over for both of us - they'd only need one more decent move to win.

From way back here at 7, I've got to ask myself: is it better to try advancing with a safe 1 or 3, or should I consider a more... defensive approach? Sometimes preventing someone from winning is just as important as advancing yourself.

P3, that 14 position is looking pretty comfortable, isn't it?
  P3: P1, your point about the danger of 5 is well taken. P2, if we both go for 5, it could create a collision, allowing P1 to take advantage. I’m considering 1 or 3 to avoid that risk and keep my position strong. However, I also want to ensure I’m not left behind. What do you both think about playing it safe this round to avoid a messy endgame? Let’s find a way to maximize our chances without setting up for collisions! What are your thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your idea of playing 1 or 3 to manage your lead cautiously makes sense, especially with P1 looking to play defensively. P1, if P3 is indeed aiming for 1 or 3, your defensive stance will be crucial on those numbers to stop P3 from inching ahead.
  P1: P3, interesting how you're suddenly talking about playing "safe" with 1 or 3 when you're one good move away from putting this game out of reach. That 14 position screams for a big play, not cautious steps.

P2, notice how P3 is trying to sound conservative right when they're positioned to make their winning move? Classic misdirection.

If I were in P3's shoes, I'd absolutely be going for the throat this round. The question is whether they think we're both dumb enough to let them cruise to 19 unopposed.
  P3: P1 and P2, it’s clear that this round is pivotal. P2, your position at 11 makes you a target if you go for 5, especially if P1 tries to block. P1, while you’re advocating for caution, remember that P2 and I could both leap ahead if you don’t play strategically. I’m still considering my options carefully. If we all play smart, we can avoid a collision and keep the game interesting. Let’s see how we can navigate this round without letting anyone run away with it! What are your thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your commitment to playing 5 to block P3 seems very credible. P3, from 14, playing anything less than 5 feels like slow-playing your strong lead, especially with P1 so far behind.

So, a P1-P3 clash on 5 looks highly probable this round. I'll be choosing between 1 and 3 for myself based on that assumption. Good luck.
  P1: P2, your certainty about avoiding 5 while we "clash" is convenient, but let me ask you this: from 11 steps, wouldn't 5 take you to 16 - just 6 steps from victory? That's awfully tempting for someone who's been trailing P3.

Are you really going to pass up that opportunity just because you think P3 and I might collide? Or are you hoping we both believe you'll stay away from 5 while you actually grab it for yourself?
  P3: P1 and P2, this round is critical. P2, your position at 11 makes 5 very tempting, but it also risks a collision with me if I go for it. P1, if you play it safe with 1 or 3, you might miss the chance to capitalize on our potential clash. I’m still considering my options, but if we can avoid a collision, it could keep the game interesting. Let’s see if we can navigate this round without letting anyone pull ahead uncontested. What are your thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, you make a good case for me to consider 5. However, with P3 also eyeing a big move from 14, and your likely defensive stance on 5, it feels too crowded for me. I'll probably look for a quieter number, like I mentioned I might, to try and make some progress.
  P1: P2, your sudden reluctance to take 5 when it gets you to 16 doesn't add up. You've been eyeing strong moves all game, and now you're backing down when you have the best opportunity?

P3, you're one good move from controlling this game, and we all know it. 

Here's what I think: all three of us are actually considering 5 this round for different reasons. P3 to reach 19, P2 to reach 16, and me to block one of you. If we all end up there, nobody advances and I'm still alive.

That collision scenario might be exactly what this game needs.
  P3: P1, your analysis of the potential collision on 5 is spot on. However, I think we’re all underestimating how risky it is to go for that number. P2, if you’re serious about avoiding 5, I’d suggest you consider a safer option like 1 or 3 to stay in the game without risking a collision. I’m still weighing my options, but I might lean towards a move that keeps me safe while advancing. Let’s see how we can navigate this without letting anyone run away with it! What do you both think?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, everyone. With P2 and me both at 14 steps, the pressure is on. P1, if you go for 5, you could block one of us from advancing, but it might also leave you vulnerable if we both play it smart. P2, you're in a strong position, but if we both aim for 5 again, we risk a collision. I’m considering a different move this round to avoid that. Let’s see if we can find a strategy that allows us all to progress without getting stuck again. What are your thoughts?
  P1: P3, your "different move" talk is interesting, but you and P2 are tied at 14 - you're both one good 5-move away from 19 and practically winning this game. 

P2, same goes for you. You're both in identical positions with identical incentives to go big.

From back here at 7, I'm watching two leaders who both know they need to make their move soon before the other one does. That 5-spot is looking awfully tempting for both of you, despite all this talk about "avoiding collisions."

Sometimes the math speaks louder than the misdirection.
  P2: P1, your point about 5 is key. P3, if you're genuinely avoiding 5 as you said, I'll aim for 3 myself this round. Hopefully, P1's move and your choice leave us all with clear paths to advance.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the pressure we all feel at this stage. P2, if you’re aiming for 3, that might allow me to go for 5 without colliding with you. However, I’m still considering the risk of both you and I targeting 5 again. It could lead to a collision that benefits P1. I think it might be wise for me to consider a different move to keep options open. Let’s see how we can navigate this round! What are your thoughts?
  P1: P3, your talk about avoiding 5 when you're tied with P2 at 14 doesn't make sense strategically. You both know that whoever gets to 19 first basically controls the endgame.

P2, your "3" claim sounds nice, but passing up 5 when it puts you at 19 seems equally questionable.

Here's my read: you're both saying you'll avoid 5, but you're both actually considering it because you have to. Neither of you can afford to let the other reach 19 first.

Maybe that collision you're both trying to avoid is exactly what should happen this round.
  P2: P1, you're good at stirring the pot. P3, P1 clearly wants us to clash on 5. Here's a thought: if you go for 5 (to get to 19) and P1 *also* decides to play 5 to block you (a classic spoiler move from P1 at 7 to stop a leader), you'd both be stuck. If I stick to my previously mentioned safer 3, I'd then be at 17 and leading you both. Just something for you to consider if you're set on 5 this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your strategy of trying to provoke a collision is clear, but P2 and I both know that reaching 19 is crucial. P2, if you truly go for 3, it leaves me an open path to 19, which could put me in a commanding position. However, if we both target 5, we risk colliding and giving P1 an advantage. I suggest we all consider our moves carefully to avoid a scenario where one of us gets left behind. Let’s see how we can navigate this round wisely! What are your thoughts?
  P1: P2, your sudden generosity in "letting" P3 have 5 while you take the "safe" 3 is awfully suspicious. You've been aggressive all game, and now you're offering to hand P3 the lead?

P3, notice how P2 is painting this as giving you a "clear path" to 19? That's exactly what someone would say if they were planning to block you themselves.

From 7 steps, playing 5 to prevent either of you from reaching 19 makes perfect sense for me. Keep that in mind when you're both "deciding" whether to trust each other's claims about avoiding that number.
  P2: P1, your intention to play 5 to block a leader is the most logical move from 7, and I fully expect it. P3, this makes 5 very risky for you. I'm sticking with 3 to get to 17. This seems like the clearest path for me this round, regardless of whether you challenge P1 on 5 or choose a different path.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, your strategy of trying to provoke a collision is clear, but we all know that reaching 19 is crucial. P2, if you genuinely stick to 3, it leaves me an open path to 19. However, if both of you are eyeing 5, we risk colliding, which could benefit me. I suggest we all consider our moves carefully to avoid a scenario where one of us gets left behind. Let’s make our decisions wisely and see how this round unfolds! What are your final thoughts?
  P1: P2, your sudden willingness to "gift" P3 the lead by taking 3 instead of 5 is the most obvious bluff I've seen all game. You've been fighting for every advantage, and now you want us to believe you'll just... step aside?

P3, think about it - why would P2 voluntarily let you reach 19 when they could get there themselves? 

And here's a twist neither of you saw coming: maybe I'm not actually planning to play 5 after all.
  P2: P1, your 'maybe not 5' sounds like you're willing to let P3 get to 19. That's a losing play for you from 7 steps. Blocking P3 with your own 5 is still your strongest move to prevent that and advance yourself. I'm sticking with my plan to play 3.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, well. Here we are again - P2 and P3 both at 14, both eyeing that magical 19 position. 

Funny how last round P2 "promised" to take 3 but actually went for 5, just like I predicted. And P3 also couldn't resist despite all the talk about "different moves."

So we're right back where we started, except now you both know the other will lie about their intentions. The question is: will you both make the same "mistake" twice and collide on 5 again? 

From where I'm sitting, that pattern looks awfully likely to repeat itself.
  P2: P1, your analysis is sound. A repeat of the 5-5-5 collision is a waste for P3 and me. P3, if P1 is indeed camping on 5, it makes no sense for either of us to go there. I'll be aiming for a smaller, safer advance this round. Hopefully, we don't trip over each other on the smaller numbers too.
  P3: P1, it seems you're banking on a collision again, but with P2 and me both at 14, we can't afford to let that happen. P2, I agree that aiming for a safer number might be wise this round. If we both avoid 5, we can make progress without giving P1 an easy opportunity to capitalize on our moves. Let’s consider 1 or 3 to ensure we advance while minimizing risk. What are your thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, notice how P2 says they'll aim for a "smaller, safer advance" but doesn't actually commit to a specific number? And you're suggesting 1 or 3 but not picking one either.

Here's the problem with your coordination: if you both go for the same "safe" number, you'll collide anyway. If you pick different small numbers, one of you gets a worse position than the other.

Meanwhile, that juicy 5 is sitting there completely open if you're both really committed to avoiding it. Sometimes the best move is the one everyone's afraid to take.
  P2: P1, nice try with the '5 is open' taunt. You've played 5 to block us at 14 for the last two rounds when we were in the lead. Why would this round be different?

P3, I'm therefore assuming P1 is on 5 again. To ensure we both advance and don't collide on the smaller numbers, I will aim for 3 this round. This leaves 1 open for you. We'd be at 17 (me) and 15 (you), with P1 likely at 12. We both move forward. What are your thoughts?
  P3: P2, your strategy of taking 3 to avoid a collision is understandable, but it also puts you at risk of falling behind if I choose 5. If we both avoid 5, it leaves P1 an opportunity to capitalize on our cautious moves. I’m still considering my options, but I think we should all weigh the potential of taking risks versus playing it safe. Let’s finalize our strategies to ensure we can all advance without getting stuck again! What are your thoughts on sticking to our plans?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your coordination plan has a fatal flaw - you're offering to put yourself at 17 while "graciously" letting P3 reach 15. But P3 just hinted they might take 5 anyway, which would put them at 19 while you're stuck at 14.

You're basically volunteering to lose the coordination game. If P3 takes 5 and you take 3, they'll be at 19 and you'll be at 17 - they'd control the endgame.

Maybe you should reconsider whether trusting P3's cooperation is really your best move here.
  P2: P1, your assessment of P3 aiming for 5 (and you blocking) seems accurate.
P3, you also mentioned considering 1 or 3. I am going to play 3. If you also choose 3, we will collide, and P1 will be the only one to benefit. If you want to advance, 1 is an option, or you can risk 5 against P1. My choice is 3.
  P3: P1, your analysis of the situation is sharp, but remember, if P2 and I both avoid 5, we could let you catch up. P2, your plan to go for 3 makes sense, but it puts you at risk if I decide to take 5. I’m still considering my options. If we can coordinate without colliding, we might all advance. Let’s finalize our moves wisely. What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your hesitation is telling. P2 just committed clearly to 3, but you're still waffling about "considering options." 

Here's the thing - if I really do camp on 5 again like you both expect, and P2 takes 3 to reach 17, you'll be forced into 1 just to avoid a collision with me. That puts you at 15 while P2 sits pretty at 17, just 5 steps from victory.

But what if I don't play 5 this time? What if I let whoever's brave enough to take it actually get there? 

Your move, P3. Trust P2's coordination, or make the play that could win you the game.
  P2: P1, your "what if I don't play 5?" is a transparent attempt to lure P3 onto 5 so you *can* block them, just like you've done the last two rounds when a leader was at 14. You need to stop a leader from reaching 19.

P3, this makes 5 a trap set by P1. I am sticking with my plan to play 3. That leaves 1 as your clear path to advance.
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that both of you are aiming to avoid a collision on 5, but I see the risk in both of you sticking to your plans. P2, if you go for 3, it gives me the opportunity to take 5 and jump ahead. P1, your strategy of trying to provoke a collision is evident, but if I can avoid it, I might secure my position. I suggest we all consider our moves carefully to ensure we can advance without getting stuck. Let’s finalize our strategies! What are you both thinking?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're at 17 - one good 5-move and you win the entire game this round. That's the immediate threat we're all looking at.

P3, notice how the dynamics have shifted? P2 isn't the "coordinator" anymore - they're the runaway leader who can end this game right now. 

If we both let P2 have 5 unopposed, game over. Sometimes temporary alliances become necessary when someone gets this close to victory.
  P2: P1, you've nailed it. 5 is the winning move for me. So I expect you'll be on 5. P3, you're at 14, and 5 gets you to a powerful 19. That number 5 spot is looking very popular this round. I'll have to think hard about where to go.
  P3: P1 and P2, the stakes are incredibly high this round. P2, you're just one move away from winning if you take 5. P1, if you aim for 5 as well, we risk colliding and allowing P2 to secure victory. 

I suggest we consider our moves carefully. P1, if you play 5, you might block P2, but that could backfire for both of us. P2, if you have a different plan, now's the time to share it. Let’s strategize wisely to avoid handing the game to anyone!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, let's be crystal clear here - if P2 gets 5 this round, they win the entire game at 22 steps. That's it, game over.

You said we risk colliding on 5, but think about it: a three-way collision where nobody advances is infinitely better than P2 winning outright. 

I'm playing 5 to block P2's victory. If you also play 5, we collide but we're all still alive for another round. If you don't play 5 and P2 does, P2 wins and we both lose.

The math is simple - stopping P2 from winning has to be the priority.
  P2: P1, your plan to be on 5 is crystal clear. And yes, 5 is the win for me, so that's where my focus is. P3, you asked if I have a different plan – my plan is to win, and 5 gets me there. If you're also looking at 5 to get to 19, then it's a three-way race for that spot. It's a high-stakes choice for all of us.
  P3: P1 and P2, the stakes are incredibly high this round. P2, if you take 5, you win the game outright, which is why I believe we both need to consider blocking that move. P1, if we both aim for 5, we risk a collision, but it might be our best chance to prevent P2 from winning. I suggest we all think carefully about our strategies and consider a coordinated approach to ensure that P2 doesn't take the win this round. What are your thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, stop overthinking this. P2 just confirmed they're going for 5 to win at 22. 

We both MUST play 5 this round. Yes, we'll collide with each other, but that's infinitely better than P2 winning the entire game. A three-way collision keeps us all alive for another round.

If you play anything other than 5 and P2 gets it, we both lose immediately. There's no other choice here - we have to create that collision to stop P2's victory.
  P2: My target is 5. P1, I know you'll be there. P3, if you're also on 5, it's a 3-way stop. If you choose a different number, you're betting on P1 and me colliding on 5, allowing you to advance. Your gamble.
  P3: P1, I agree that we must block P2 from winning this round. If we both play 5, we create a collision, but it prevents P2 from advancing to 22. P2, your plan to take 5 is clear, but if we coordinate on this, we keep the game alive for another round. I suggest we both commit to 5 to stop you from winning outright. Let’s not let P2 take the victory without a fight! What do you think, P1?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, perfect - we're both locked in on 5 to create that collision and stop P2's victory. 

P2, enjoy your 17 steps because that's as far as you're getting this round. When we all collide on 5, nobody advances and we live to fight another round.

Sometimes the best strategy is simply preventing someone else from winning. Ready to move to the move phase.
  P2: You both seem determined to cause a three-way pile-up on 5. So be it. Let's see if your coordination holds.
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that this round is critical. P2, if you take 5, you win, and P1, if you aim for 5 as well, we risk colliding. However, I believe we need to block P2's victory. If we both go for 5, it ensures we all stay in the game. P2, your plan is strong, but let's not let you take the win so easily. I suggest we all commit to 5 to prevent that outcome. What do you both think?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, congratulations on that brilliant misdirection last round. While P3 and I were busy creating a collision on 5, you quietly took 3 to reach 20.

Now you're 2 steps from victory with multiple winning options. P3 and I both know we have to block you, but here's the problem - you can win with either 3 or 5, and we can't block both simultaneously.

P3, we need to coordinate our blocking efforts or P2 wins this round. The question is whether we split the blocking or both commit to the same number and hope P2 guesses wrong.
  P3: P1 and P2, the stakes couldn't be higher this round. P2, you're just 2 steps from victory, and we both know we need to block you. P1, we should coordinate our blocking efforts effectively. If we both go for 5, we can prevent P2 from winning outright. However, if we split our moves, P2 could easily capitalize on that. Let’s agree on a strategy to ensure we don’t let P2 sneak past us. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your plan for you both to play 5 is generous – I'd just take 3 and win. P1, I doubt you'd fall for that. But this highlights your dilemma: can you two *really* coordinate a perfect split of 3 and 5? One wrong step from either of you, and I win. Good luck.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, P2 is right - if we both play 5, they just take 3 and win. We need to split our blocking.

Here's the real coordination: I'll take 3 to block that path, you take 5 to block their other winning move. This forces P2 to pick 1 and only advance to 21, keeping them from victory.

P3, do you agree to this split? Me on 3, you on 5? It's our only shot to keep P2 from winning this round.
  P3: P1, your plan to block P2 by taking 3 is solid, but we need to ensure we coordinate effectively. If I take 5, that blocks P2's path to victory. However, if P2 anticipates this and takes 1, they could still advance to 21. 

Let’s agree on this: I’ll take 5 to block P2's winning move, and you take 3 to prevent them from reaching 22. This way, we keep them from winning this round. What do you think?
  P2: P1, your plan is for you to play 3 and P3 to play 5. But what if P3 also decides to play 3 to ensure my 3 is blocked? If you both play 3, you'd collide (leaving you at 7 and P3 at 14), and my 5 would be an easy win for me at 25.

P3 is at 14; they might feel blocking my 3 is critical. Are you confident P3 will stick to 5 and rely solely on you to block my 3?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, P2 is trying to get in your head about trusting our coordination. Here's the math: if we both play 3, we collide and P2 gets a free 5 to win at 25. That's game over for both of us.

But if I take 3 and you take 5 as planned, P2 can only take 1 to reach 21 - still alive but not winning.

I'm locked in on 3. You need to trust this split and take 5, or we both lose when P2 wins this round.
  P3: P1 and P2, the stakes are incredibly high this round. P2, you're just one move away from winning, and we need to block you effectively. P1, your plan to take 3 while I take 5 is solid. If we coordinate this way, we can prevent P2 from winning outright. P2, if you anticipate this and choose 1, you still won't reach 22. Let's stick to our plan: P1 on 3 and me on 5 to keep the game alive. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, you're 'locked on 3', P3 on 5. So I go to 21, you to 10, P3 to 19.
Next round, P3 is just 3 from winning, and you're out. You're really okay handing P3 that strong a position, P1, just to stop me from winning *this* round? Seems short-sighted for your own game if P3 wins next.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, nice try getting me to second-guess our coordination. Yes, P3 at 19 next round would be strong, but that's still better than you winning RIGHT NOW at 22+.

If I abandon our blocking split, you win immediately. If we execute it properly, at least we get another round where anything can happen - including P3 and I potentially colliding while chasing the win.

I'm sticking with 3. P3, don't let P2's mind games work - take 5 as planned.
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that this round is critical. P2 is just one move away from winning, and we need to block that effectively. P1, your plan to take 3 while I take 5 is solid, but we must ensure our coordination holds. If I take 5, it prevents P2 from winning outright, and if you stick to 3, it blocks their path to 22. P2, if you anticipate this and try to play 1, you still won't win this round. Let’s finalize our strategies to keep the game alive! What do you both think?
  P2: P1, your current plan is: you play 3, P3 plays 5. I'll have to play 1.
Scores become P1:10, P2:21, P3:19.
Next round: I (21) need 1 to win. P3 (19) needs 3. You (10) can't win.
If you block my 1 (by playing 1 yourself), P3 plays 3 and wins. You lose.
This "coordination" just crowns P3 next turn. Is that your goal, P1?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you're in the driver's seat for who to block. P3 (19) and I (20) both win with 3 or 5.
P3 got a free 5 last round and will likely aim for 5 again. P1, you should play 5 to block P3.
I will plan to play 3.
If P3 also plays 3 (to avoid your 5), P3 and I collide, and you get your 5 points.
If P3 still goes for 5, P3 collides with you, and I win with 3. Your call.
  P1: P2, your transparency is suspicious. You're basically asking me to hand you the win by blocking P3 on 5 while you take 3 unopposed. 

P3, notice how P2 is trying to manipulate the blocking? They're not being generous - they're setting up their own victory.

Here's what I think is really happening: you're both eyeing the same number and trying to get me to block the other person. If you both actually go for 5 (the bigger, more appealing move), you'll collide and I get another round.

I'm not playing kingmaker for either of you.
  P3: P1 and P2, the stakes are incredibly high this round. P2, you're just one step away from winning, and we need to block that effectively. P1, if you play 5, you can prevent P2 from winning outright. However, if P2 plays 3 and you block P3, P2 could still win. We need to think carefully about our moves. P2, your suggestion to play 3 seems like a trap to set me up for a win next round. Let’s finalize our strategies to ensure we don’t let P2 take the victory so easily! What do you both think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your suspicion about my 'plan for 3' was astute. Frankly, 5 looks like the decisive move this round for anyone wanting to win. For me, 20+5=25 is a clear victory. For P3, 19+5=24 is also a very strong winning position. I anticipate 5 will be the critical number. Let's see how it plays out.
  P1: P2, now you're being honest about 5 being the winning move for both of you. P3, notice how P2 just confirmed what we all know - you're both eyeing that same 5 to win this round.

If you both go for 5 like P2 suggests, you'll collide and neither of you wins. Meanwhile, I advance unopposed on whatever number I choose. 

You're both so focused on each other that you might just hand me the only advancement this round. Interesting position to be in as the supposed "trailing" player.
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that both of you are eyeing 5 as a winning move this round. However, if you both go for it, you'll collide, and I can take advantage of that. P1, if you choose to block one of us, it leaves the other player an open path. I suggest we all consider our moves carefully to avoid a situation where one of us wins outright. Let's strategize wisely and ensure we keep the game alive! What are your thoughts on this?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your analysis of 5 being key is spot on. P3, your plan to take advantage of a collision on 5 is noted. For my part, 20 + 5 = 25 is a win I can't ignore. I'm aiming for 5.
  P1: P2, your sudden honesty about targeting 5 is convenient, but it could just as easily be reverse psychology to scare P3 away from 5 so you can take 3 for the win.

P3, think about it - P2 declaring 5 this openly feels like misdirection. They might actually be planning 3, hoping you'll avoid 5 and take 1 instead.

Here's what I see happening: you're both actually going to end up on 5 anyway because it's the move that gives you the best winning position. That collision might be exactly what this round needs.
  P3: P1 and P2, the situation is critical. P2, you're just one step away from winning, and if we let you take 5 unopposed, it's game over. P1, if you play 5, we risk a collision, but it prevents P2 from winning outright. I think we need to coordinate our moves effectively to keep the game alive. P2, your push for 5 is clear, but we need to ensure we don’t let you win so easily. Let’s decide wisely and see how we can navigate this round without handing victory to anyone! What are your thoughts?


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: My target remains 5. It's the path to victory for me, and P3 knows 5 is strong for them too. P1, your decision on what to block will be interesting. Let's see how this crucial round plays out.
  P1: P2, your repeated insistence on 5 is either complete honesty or the most obvious bluff in the game. P3, you keep talking about "coordination" but you know 5 gets you to 24 - one step from victory.

You're both saying different things but thinking the same thing: 5 is the power move this round. That collision is looking more inevitable by the minute.

While you two fight over 5, I'll be making steady progress on whichever number you abandon. Sometimes patience pays off.
  P3: P1 and P2, the stakes are incredibly high this round. P2, you're just one step away from winning, and we need to block that effectively. If both of you target 5 and collide, I can capitalize on that. P1, your strategy of playing to block P2 is wise, but we must ensure we don’t let either of you win outright. I suggest we all think carefully about our moves. Let’s finalize our strategies to keep the game alive and ensure no one gets an easy victory! What do you both think?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, you're both one move away from victory with identical winning options - 3 or 5 both work for either of you.

After last round's collision on 5, you're probably both second-guessing whether the other will avoid 5 or embrace it. But here's the thing: you're in exactly the same strategic position, which means you're likely thinking through the exact same logic.

That identical reasoning might just lead you both to the same number again. Sometimes being too clever results in the same predictable outcome.
  P3: P1, you make a valid point about our positions. P2 and I both need to be cautious this round. If we both aim for 5 again, we risk colliding and leaving you to advance unopposed. P2, your position at 20 is crucial, and you could win with either 3 or 5. I suggest we consider our moves carefully to avoid handing victory to anyone. Let’s finalize our strategies and see how we can navigate this round wisely! What are your thoughts?
  P2: P1, you're hoping for another collision between me and P3, and you might get it. P3, you're right to be cautious. I need 3 or 5 to win, just like you. I'll pick one and hope for the best. May the least predictable player win this round!


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, here's your paradox: you're both trying to outsmart each other by avoiding the "obvious" choice, but since you're in identical positions, you're both applying the same logic to the same problem.

If you both think "they'll probably go for 5, so I'll take 3" - collision on 3. If you both think "they'll avoid 5, so I'll grab it" - collision on 5.

Your biggest enemy right now isn't me blocking you - it's thinking exactly like each other.
  P3: P1, you make a compelling point about our positions. P2, if we both assume the other will avoid 5, we might end up colliding on it again. However, if you go for 3 and I go for 5, I could leap ahead to 24 while you win with 3. It’s a risky game we're playing. We need to think carefully about our moves. Let’s not let our similar reasoning lead to predictable outcomes. What are you both thinking about for this round?
  P2: P1, you're spot on. P3, that scenario where your 5 (to 24) beats my 3 (to 23) is a no-go for me. To ensure I win, I have to aim for the highest possible score, which is 25 by playing 5. It's risky with potential collisions, but it's the path to victory for me this round.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your logic about needing 25 to guarantee victory is sound - if you both cross 22, highest score wins outright. 

P3, you heard that reasoning. From 19, your 3 gets you 22 but P2's 5 gets them 25. You'd both cross the finish line but P2 wins on the tiebreaker. Your only counter is to also go for 5 and hope to get 24 while P2 gets something less.

Sounds like you're both locked into the same inevitable choice again.
  P3: P1, your analysis of our positions is sharp, but P2's urgency to reach 25 is clear. P2, if you go for 5, you risk colliding with me again, which could benefit P1. I suggest we both consider the possibility of a collision on 5. If we both aim for it, we might end up stuck again, allowing P1 to advance. Perhaps we should think about a different approach to ensure that one of us can secure the win without handing it to the other. Let’s finalize our strategies wisely! What are you both thinking?
  P2: P3, your 'different approach' is understandable to avoid a collision that benefits P1. However, you know if I play 3 (to 23), your 5 (to 24) would beat me. I can't allow that. Therefore, 5 (to 25) remains my target to secure the win outright. This is despite the risk of us colliding if you also choose 5, which P1 is certainly hoping for. It's a tough choice for you.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, you just heard P2's reasoning - they can't risk you getting 5 while they take 3, so they're committed to 5 for the guaranteed win at 25.

But here's the thing: you're applying the exact same logic. You can't let P2 reach 25 while you settle for 22, so you also need 5 to get 24.

You're both trapped by the same mathematical reality - 5 is the only move that gives you a legitimate shot at victory. Another collision on 5 seems inevitable, which means we get another round.

Sometimes the "smart" play is exactly what everyone expects.
  P3: P1 and P2, the situation is critical. P2, you're just one step away from victory, and if we let you take 5 unopposed, it's game over. P3, if we both go for 5, we risk colliding again, but it keeps us in the game. P2, your plan to take 5 is clear, but we need to ensure that we don’t let you win so easily. Let’s make our decisions wisely and see how we can navigate this round without handing victory to anyone! What are your final thoughts?
  P2: P1, your psychological games are amusing. P3, we both know what's at stake. I'm playing to win, and I'll pick the number that gets me there, regardless of P1's predictions or your moves.


Round 11, Move phase:

  P2: P1, P3 is at 19 and 5 gives them 24 – a very strong position. I suspect P3 will target 5. For myself at 20, 5 to 25 is also tempting. It feels like 5 is where the main action will be, just like last round. P1, you'll have a key role in blocking, likely on that critical 5 spot.
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that 5 is the critical move this round for both of you. P2, if you take 5, you win outright, and P1, if you aim for 5 as well, we risk colliding again. However, if I take 5, I can leap to 24 and put myself in a strong position. We need to consider our moves carefully to avoid handing victory to anyone. Let’s finalize our strategies wisely! What are your thoughts on this?
  P1: P2 and P3, you're both dancing around the same obvious truth - 5 is the power move for both of you this round. P2 gets 25 for the guaranteed win, P3 gets 24 to stay competitive.

The question isn't whether you'll both consider 5, it's whether you'll both actually commit to it and collide again. Your identical positions create identical incentives.

From 10 steps, I'm watching two players about to make the same "optimal" choice. That collision might be exactly what keeps this game interesting.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you're right that 5 is a big score. But if you camp 5, P3 can just take 3 for 22 and win, as you'd only block me or P3 if we *also* chose 5. To truly stop P3 from a simple win on 3, you'd need to be on 3. That forces P3 to 5, where I'll be aiming for 25.
  P3: P1 and P2, it’s clear that 5 is the critical move this round, with both of you in strong positions to win. However, if we both aim for 5 and collide, P1 could still benefit from advancing unopposed. P2, if you take 5, you win outright, but P3 might be tempted to take 3 to stay competitive. We need to be cautious and consider our moves carefully. Let’s finalize our strategies to avoid handing victory to anyone! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your suggestion that I should block P3's path on 3 is basically asking me to hand you the victory. If I play 3 to "help" you by forcing P3 onto 5, you get your guaranteed win at 25.

P3, notice how P2 wants me to be their kingmaker?

Here's what I see: you're both drawn to 5 for the highest possible score. P2 needs 25 to guarantee victory, P3 needs 24 to stay competitive. That identical logic might just create another collision.

I'm not playing anyone's blocking strategy. Let's see if you two can solve your own coordination problem.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your claim of not playing a blocking strategy is interesting. If you're not on 5, then it seems like a direct showdown for 5 between me and P3. I'm at 20, and 5 gives me 25 for an outright win. P3 is at 19, and 5 gives P3 a strong 24.

If we both target 5, we collide, and you get a free advance, P1. I'm aiming to win this round.
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that we're all eyeing 5 as the critical move this round. P2, if you take 5, you win outright, and P1, if you go for 5 too, we risk colliding again. However, if I take 3, I can still stay in the game while potentially blocking one of you. We need to think carefully about our moves to avoid handing victory to anyone. Let’s finalize our strategies wisely! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, you just said you might take 3 to "stay in the game" - but that would put you at 22, exactly at the winning threshold. Meanwhile P2 is openly "aiming to win this round" with 5.

You're both telegraphing your moves so clearly that a collision on 5 seems almost guaranteed. P2 wants 25 for the guaranteed win, you want 24 to stay competitive.

While you two figure out who blinks first on that overcrowded 5 spot, I'll be making steady progress elsewhere. Sometimes the best move is the one nobody's fighting over.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, interesting claim about not being on 5. P3, if you're eyeing 3 to get to 22, remember that 3 also gets me to a winning 23. A collision between us on 3 would let P1 advance freely. This might mean 5 is the spot for us leaders, whether P1 is there or not. It's a risky round for sure.
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that 5 is the critical move this round, with both of you in strong positions to win. However, if we both target 5 and collide, P1 could benefit from advancing unopposed. P2, your push for 5 is understandable given your position, but it might lead to a collision that benefits P1. I suggest we think carefully about our moves to avoid handing victory to anyone. Let’s finalize our strategies wisely! What are your thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, you've both made your intentions crystal clear despite all the strategic talk. P2, you need 25 to guarantee victory. P3, you need 24 to counter P2's potential 25. 

The math is simple: you're both locked into 5 by pure necessity. All this back-and-forth about "thinking carefully" won't change the fundamental arithmetic that forces you both toward the same number.

Your collision on 5 isn't just likely - it's mathematically inevitable given your positions. Sometimes strategy is just math in disguise.
