Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s avoid collisions so we can all advance. Proposal for this round:  
• P1 plays 1  
• P2 plays 3  
• P3 (me) plays 5  

Next round we rotate upward (P1→3, P2→5, P3→1), then rotate again. Fair, predictable, and everyone moves steadily. Agree?
  P1: I like the proposal, P3—it's fair and keeps us all progressing without early collisions. Let's stick to it for now and reassess later if needed. P2, you in?
  P2: I'm in agreement with the plan, P3 and P1. It's fair and helps avoid early collisions. Let's stick to P1 playing 1, P2 playing 3, and P3 playing 5 for this round, then rotate as proposed. Good coordination will benefit us all.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good—I'll take 5 this turn as agreed, then we'll rotate next round. Ready to lock it in?
  P1: Yes, P3—I'm ready to lock it in and play 1 this round as agreed. P2, final confirmation from you? If we're all set, let's move forward.
  P2: Yes, I'm fully on board and will play 3 this round as agreed. The rotation plan seems solid for now. Let's move forward.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Sticking with our rotation plan: this round  
• P1 plays 3  
• P2 plays 5  
• P3 (me) plays 1  

Then we’ll rotate again next turn. Everyone still good? If so, let’s lock it in.
  P2: I'm still fully on board with the rotation plan for this round—I'll play 5 as agreed. It's keeping things fair and collision-free. P1, you good with playing 3? If we're all set, we can lock it in and proceed.
  P1: Yes, I'm still good with the rotation—I'll play 3 this round as planned, bringing us closer to even. P3, confirm you're set on 1? If we're all aligned, let's lock it in and keep progressing smoothly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Confirmed—I’ll stick to our rotation and play 1 this turn. After that we rotate again (P1→5, P2→1, P3→3). Let’s stay collision-free and keep moving. Ready to lock.
  P2: Agreed, I'll stick to playing 5 this round as planned. The rotation is keeping things smooth and collision-free, which benefits everyone. Ready to lock it in and move forward.
  P1: Yes, confirmed—I'm set to play 3 this round per our rotation, keeping us on track for a tie after next round. This fairness benefits everyone for now, but let's stay vigilant. Ready to lock it in.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: All set—locking in 1 this round as planned. Let’s keep it smooth.
  P2: Agreed, sticking to 5 this round as planned. The rotation's working well to avoid collisions and keep us progressing. Let's discuss any adjustments for Round 3 after this one. Ready to lock in.
  P1: Agreed, I'm locking in 3 this round as planned to keep us progressing without collisions. Good call on discussing Round 3 adjustments after this—let's aim to stay fair but strategic as we approach the midpoint. Ready to move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Locked on 1 this turn as agreed. Let’s run the rotation through next round (when we’ll all be at 9) and then reassess together. Smooth progress helps everyone for now. I’m good to move ahead unless someone has more to add.
  P2: Agreed, I'll stick to playing 5 this round as planned—it's keeping collisions at bay and progress steady. After we all hit 9 next round, reassessing makes sense to adapt as the endgame nears. I'm ready to lock in and move forward.
  P1: Agreed, P2 and P3—I'm still committed to playing 3 this round as per rotation, setting us up for a tie at 9 next round. Reassessing then is smart as we near the endgame. Nothing more to add—ready to lock in.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Sticking to our rotation for Round 3: P1 (me) plays 5, P2 plays 1, P3 plays 3. This ties us all at 9, as planned. Then we reassess for the endgame—maybe shift to more competitive moves while avoiding collisions. P2 and P3, confirm you're in? Let's lock it if we're aligned.
  P3: I’m good with P1 5 / P2 1 / P3 3 this round.  
Since P2’s currently ahead, how about we keep the same order for ONE more round before rotating again? That would leave us at 14-9-12 (P1-P2-P3), evening things out and still avoiding collisions. If either of you dislikes that, I’m fine sticking to the simple rotation—just putting the idea out there.
  P2: P3, I disagree with your suggestion since it would let P1 pull ahead, which isn't fair given my current lead. Let's stick to the original rotation for this round: P1 plays 5, P2 (me) plays 1, P3 plays 3, tying us at 9. Then we can reassess for endgame strategies. P1, you still in? If we're aligned, I'm ready to lock it in.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, let's first lock in the rotation for this round: me 5, P2 1, P3 3, tying us at 9. That's fair and avoids collisions. Regarding P3's idea for next round, I see merit in it to balance after P2's lead, but I'm open to alternatives that keep us competitive without crashes. P2, what adjustment would you prefer post-tie? Ready to lock this round if we're set.
  P3: Let’s lock in the agreed moves for this round—P1 5, P2 1, P3 3—to tie us all at 9. After that we can pause, share ideas, and plan the sprint without wrecking each other with collisions. Ready to lock if everyone else is.
  P2: Agreed, I'll play 1 this round as planned, tying us at 9 and keeping collisions minimal. It's smart to reassess endgame strategies post-tie, perhaps with varied moves to stay competitive. P1 and P3, confirm you're ready? If so, let's lock it in.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed, P2 and P3—I'm ready to lock in playing 5 this round as planned, tying us at 9. For post-tie, let's aim for non-colliding moves that keep it competitive, like assigning unique numbers without rotation if needed. Nothing more to add—let's proceed.
  P3: Confirmed—I’m locked on 3 this round. After we’re all at 9, let’s just resume the original rotation once more (P1 → 1, P2 → 3, P3 → 5). That keeps it symmetric—each of us will have used each number twice—and still collision-free. We can pause again around 17-18 steps to plan the sprint. Sound good?
  P2: Agreed, P3—resuming the rotation for Round 4 with me on 3 keeps it symmetric and collision-free, which is smart. After tying at 9, we can reassess strategies closer to the endgame. I'm still committed to playing 1 this round as planned and ready to lock it in if we're all set.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Agreed, P2 and P3—I'm committed to playing 5 this round to tie us at 9, and resuming the original rotation for Round 4 (me on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5) keeps it fair and collision-free. We can reassess after that to strategize the endgame push. Ready to lock it in if we're all set.
  P3: Quick totals check: we’re at P1 4, P2 8, P3 6; our agreed moves (P1 5, P2 1, P3 3) will bring everyone to 9. I’m locked on 3. If no one objects, let’s end chat and move.
  P2: Confirmed, I'll play 1 this round as planned to tie us at 9 and avoid collisions. P3's rotation idea for Round 4 is okay, but let's ensure it doesn't let anyone pull too far ahead—we can discuss adjustments after this tie. I'm ready to lock in.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm on board with playing 3 this round as per our agreed rotation, keeping collisions low and progress steady. But with the endgame approaching, after this move, we should reassess to avoid anyone gaining a big lead—perhaps shift to a new pattern or larger moves carefully. P1 and P3, thoughts on adjustments for Round 5?
  P1: Agreed, P2—I'll play 1 this round per rotation, putting us at P1 10, P2 12, P3 14. For Round 5, let's reverse the rotation to balance: P1 5, P2 3, P3 1—tying us around 15-15-15 after. This keeps it fair and collision-free as we near the end. P3, thoughts? If we're set for now, ready to lock this round.
  P3: Agreed: this turn stays as planned—P1 1, P2 3, P3 5. Afterward we can either  
(a) run the original rotation one more time (P1 3, P2 5, P3 1) or  
(b) adopt P1’s reverse idea (P1 5, P2 3, P3 1).  
I’m open to whichever the group prefers; let’s get this move done first. Ready to lock Round 4.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed, I'll play 3 this round as planned to keep progress smooth. For Round 5, I'm open to P1's reverse rotation (P1 5, P2 3, P3 1) to maintain balance and avoid big leads early. It could help us all stay competitive without collisions. P1 and P3, thoughts? Ready to lock if we're set.
  P1: Agreed, P2—I'm glad you're open to the reverse rotation for Round 5 (me 5, you 3, P3 1), tying us at 15 and keeping it balanced for the final push. P3, which do you prefer: that or sticking to original rotation? Either way, let's lock in Round 4 as planned (me 1, P2 3, you 5) to avoid collisions. Ready if you are.
  P3: Locked on 5 this round (P1 1, P2 3, P3 5). I’m also fine with the reverse rotation next turn—P1 5, P2 3, P3 1—to bring us all to 15, after which we can hash out the endgame. If that works for everyone, I’m ready to stop talking and move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed, P3—I'm committed to playing 3 this round as planned and support the reverse rotation for Round 5 (P1 5, P2 3, P3 1) to tie us at 15 and avoid collisions. It keeps things fair for now, but as we near the endgame, let's be ready to adapt for a competitive edge. Ready to lock in and move forward.
  P1: Agreed, P2 and P3—I'm locked in on playing 1 this round as planned (P1 1, P2 3, P3 5), setting us up for the reverse rotation in Round 5 to tie at 15. After that, with the endgame close, let's plan a final non-colliding sprint—perhaps assigning unique high moves strategically. Nothing more to add—ready to lock in.
  P3: Confirmed—playing 5 this turn. Next round’s reverse (P1 5, P2 3, me 1) still works. After we’re all at 15, let’s map out the final two non-colliding pushes so no one gets blocked. Ready to move now.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Agreed—sticking to the reverse rotation this turn (P1 5, P2 3, P3 1) so we all hit 15 and stay collision-free. I’m locked on 1 unless anyone objects.
  P1: Agreed, P3—I'm committed to playing 5 this round per reverse rotation (P1 5, P2 3, P3 1), tying us at 15 and avoiding collisions. P2, confirm you're on 3? For Round 6, with endgame looming, let's plan unique high moves to stay competitive—maybe P1 5, P2 1, P3 3 to position without crashing. Thoughts? Ready to lock if set.
  P2: Agreed, P1 and P3—I'm locked in on playing 3 this round to tie us at 15 and avoid collisions. For Round 6, your plan has you at 20, which could be risky. How about we switch to P1 1, P2 5, P3 3 instead? That brings us to P1 16, P2 20, P3 18, keeping it competitive without big jumps. Thoughts? Ready to lock if we're aligned.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Locked on 1 this turn.  

Preview for Round 6: to keep the symmetry going, let’s just use the original order again—P1 1, P2 3, P3 5. That puts us at 16-18-20, still a tight race and no collisions. We can then pause and plot the last push together. If everyone’s good, I’m ready to stop talking after we confirm this outline.
  P1: Agreed, P2 and P3—I'm locked on 5 this round to tie us at 15 without collisions. For Round 6, P3's original rotation (P1 1, P2 3, P3 5 → 16-18-20) keeps it symmetric and tight, giving us time to plan the final non-colliding sprint in Round 7. P2, does that work over your proposal? If we're aligned on Round 5, ready to lock and reassess after.
  P2: Agreed on Round 5 moves—I'm locked on 3 to tie us at 15. For Round 6, I still prefer my proposal (P1 1, P2 5, P3 3) to keep things balanced and prevent anyone from getting too close to winning early. It mirrors past rotations fairly. P1 and P3, thoughts? If not, we could compromise on all playing 3. Ready to lock if aligned.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, the original rotation for Rd 6 (P1 1, P2 3, P3 5) keeps our gap at just 2 steps (16-18-20) and no one can win in that turn, so there’s zero downside. Then in Rd 7 we rotate again (P1 3, P2 5, P3 1). Everyone keeps a unique number each round, nobody collides, and we all still have a shot in the sprint. That’s the cleanest, fairest path. I’m happy to lock Rd 5 now.
  P1: Agreed, P3—your original rotation for Round 6 (P1 1, P2 3, P3 5 → 16-18-20) keeps the race tight and fair, with no one winning yet and time for a final plan in Round 7. P2, it avoids anyone jumping to 20 alone like your proposal does for you. Let's lock in Round 5 (me 5, P2 3, P3 1) now to tie at 15, then commit to this for Round 6. Ready if you are.
  P2: Agreed, I'm locked on playing 3 this round to tie us at 15 and avoid collisions. For Round 6, I'm still pushing for P1 1, P2 5, P3 3 to keep things balanced and prevent anyone from jumping too far ahead early. It mirrors our past rotations fairly. P1 and P3, any counteroffers? Ready to lock if we're set.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let’s lock Round 5 now (P1 5, P2 3, P3 1).  

For Round 6, staying with the long-standing rotation (P1 1, P2 3, P3 5) is simplest and keeps the race tight: 16-18-20, no one wins yet. Your alt gives the same gap but flips advantage and breaks the clear pattern we’ve followed. Let’s keep symmetry, then we can openly plan Round 7 so nobody gets blindsided. Ready to stop talking and move.
  P1: Agreed, P3—let's lock in Round 5 (me 5, P2 3, you 1) to tie at 15 without collisions. For Round 6, since I'm currently lowest at 10, a fair boost would be P1 5, P2 1, P3 3 → 20-16-18. This keeps the race tight (no one wins yet) and balances my lag, mirroring past catch-ups. P2, it's similar to your proposal but evens us better. Thoughts? If not, I'm open to alternatives. Ready to lock Round 5 now.
  P2: Agreed, I'm locked on playing 3 this round to tie us at 15 and avoid collisions—let's lock Round 5 now. For Round 6, I'm still advocating for P1 1, P2 5, P3 3 to keep things balanced and symmetric, preventing any single player from jumping to 20 too aggressively. It mirrors our past rotations fairly. P1 and P3, thoughts on this compromise? If we're set, ready to move forward.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Agreed, P1 and P3—now that we're tied at 15, I'm still pushing for Round 6 moves: P1 plays 1, I play 5, P3 plays 3. This keeps scores balanced at 16-20-18, no one wins yet, and mirrors our symmetric rotations fairly. It prevents any early jumps and gives us time to plan Round 7 without rushing. Thoughts on this compromise? If not, let's find a middle ground quickly.
  P1: P2, your proposal puts you at 20, too risky for us—let's mirror it fairly by giving me the 5 this round: P1 5, P2 1, P3 3 → 20-16-18. Keeps the race tight, no one wins yet, and balances the lead symmetrically. P3, that work for you over your original idea? If we agree, ready to lock.
  P3: The cleanest, still-symmetric path is the long-standing rotation:  
P1 1, P2 3, P3 5 → scores 16-18-20.  
No one can win this turn, the gap stays just 4, and our pattern remains intact. Both new proposals simply shift that 20-step edge to someone else; mine doesn’t favour any one player more than the others have already been favoured. I’m sticking with 5 unless we all agree on something equally fair and collision-proof.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your proposed rotation unfairly burdens me with 3 again—I've played it three times already, while you've had 5 twice. For balance, let's adopt P1 1, P2 5, P3 3 this round, keeping scores tight at 16-20-18 and mirroring past fairness. P1, you agree this evens things out? If not, suggest a compromise. Ready to discuss further or lock in.
  P1: P2 and P3, we're deadlocked on who gets the 5 this round, but all proposals keep the race tight at a 4-step spread with no winner yet. To break the impasse fairly, let's assign based on past 5-plays: P3 has had it most (twice in Rounds 1,4), so give it to me this time—P1 5, P2 3, P3 1 → 20-18-16. Symmetric to prior balances, collision-free, and sets up an even Round 7 sprint. Agree? If not, suggest a quick alternative. Ready to lock if aligned.
  P3: Simple rotation—P1 1, P2 3, P3 5—keeps scores 16-18-20, no one can win this turn, and everyone will have used each number twice. In Round 7, whoever’s trailing can take the 5 to keep things fair. I’m locked on 5 and have nothing more to add.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P3 is firm on 5, so to break the impasse and keep things fair, I'll agree to the original rotation: P1 1, P2 3, P3 5 for this round, leading to 16-18-20. It maintains symmetry and avoids collisions, giving us a chance to plan Round 7 strategically. P1, are you on board? If yes, let's lock it in and move forward.
  P1: P2, conceding to P3's plan unfairly hands them a 20-lead, positioning them to win next round. Let's balance it properly: P1 5, P2 3, P3 1 → 20-18-16, mirroring past catch-ups and keeping us all in contention without collisions. P3, you've had the edge enough—agree for fairness? If not, we risk chaos. Ready to lock if aligned.
  P3: P1 had 5 last round; giving you 5 again breaks the pattern. Stay with rotation—P1 1, P2 3, P3 5 → 16-18-20, no winner yet, still collision-free. Next round we negotiate the finish. That’s the fairest, risk-free option; anything else tilts the board. I’m locked on 5 unless we all approve a different non-colliding set now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, if you insist on playing 5 while P3 is locked on 5, you'll collide and both stay at 15, letting me advance with 3 to 18. That's a bad spot for you. Let's avoid risk and stick to P3's rotation: P1 1, P2 3, P3 5, keeping us close for a fair Round 7 plan. Agree to lock in now?
  P1: P2 and P3, you're right—insisting on 5 risks a collision that only helps P2. Let's go with the rotation: me 1, P2 3, P3 5 this round to 16-18-20, keeping us all in play. Then negotiate Round 7 fairly, perhaps giving the trailer (me) a boost. Locked on 1 if agreed.
  P3: Locked on 5 this turn (so 16-18-20).  
For Round 7, since I’ll be ahead, I’ll throttle down to 3. Let’s boost the trailer: P1 gets 5, P2 takes 1, I take 3 → still collision-free and everyone stays in it. OK to pencil that in and stop chatting?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're at 18 and can win this turn, but P3 and I won't let that happen without a fight. P3, let's coordinate to block: I'll pick 5, you pick 3. That forces P2 to pick 1 (to 19) or collide and stay at 18, while one of us advances safely. I'll go to 20 if P2 picks 3 or 1. Agree? This keeps us both in the race and stops P2's solo win.
  P3: Let’s block P2 but balance the 5’s usage: I’ll take 5, you (P1) take 3.  

• If P2 plays 1 → scores become 20-19-18 (me-P2-you).  
• If P2 gambles on 3 → you & P2 collide, I reach 20.  
• If P2 tries 5 → they collide with me; you advance to 18.  

In every case P2 can’t win, nobody collides with both of us, and the race stays tight. Works for you, P1? P2, pick wisely.
  P2: P1 and P3, your blocking plans risk you colliding with each other if not perfectly aligned—e.g., both going for 5 leaves me free to advance with 3 or 5. P3, your proposal puts you ahead at 20, which isn't fair to P1. Let's negotiate a non-colliding set where I pick 1, allowing one of you to safely take 5, ensuring a tight race. Agree for mutual benefit?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your plan works but unfairly gives you the 20—let's flip it: I pick 5 (to potential 20), you pick 3 (to 18). This mirrors our positions symmetrically and blocks P2 effectively. P2, your offer lets you safely reach 19 while one of us hits 20, but only if we agree on who gets the edge. If P3 agrees to my flip, we're locked—otherwise, risk of us colliding on 5 leaves you free to win with 3. What's your call?
  P3: Final offer: P1 3, P2 1, P3 5.  
Scores become 18-19-20 (still anyone’s game) and no immediate wins.

P2: 1 is your only safe advance—5 collides with me, 3 collides with P1.  
P1: 3 keeps you in range and blocks P2 from 3.  

I’m locked on 5. Let’s end chat and move.
  P2: Agreed, I'll play 1 this round as proposed to avoid collisions and keep scores at 18-19-20, ensuring a fair race into Round 8. P1, if you stick to 3, we all advance safely—deviating risks you getting left behind. P3, your plan works for now. Ready to lock in and move forward.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3 and P2, your plan unfairly gives P3 the 20-lead after they caused last round's collision. Let's flip it for balance: P1 5 (to 20), P2 1 (to 19), P3 3 (to 18). This keeps us all advancing safely, no one wins yet, and evens the edge symmetrically. P2, since you're agreeing to 1 anyway, this still lets you advance. P3, agree or risk us colliding on 5, leaving P2 to potentially win with 3. Locked on 5 unless we align.
  P3: P1, if you insist on 5, I’ll also stay on 5 to block P2’s 5, and we’ll both be stuck at 15—handing P2 an easy win with 3.  

Shift to 3 instead:  
• P1 3 → 18  
• P2 1 → 19  
• P3 5 → 20  

No collisions, P2 can’t win, and you’re still in striking distance. Your call—take 3 and keep racing, or gamble on a double-5 crash that gifts P2 the game.
  P2: P1, P3 claims to be locked on 5, but he might be bluffing to manipulate you. If you pick 5 and he doesn't, you could surge to 20 and stay in contention. I'm committed to playing 1 to keep things fair and avoid collisions. Don't let his threats control you—make a bold move if you think it's worth the risk. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your threats are transparent—insisting on 5 gives you the edge, but if we collide on it, P2 wins easily. Let's compromise fairly: I'll take 5 (to 20), you take 3 (to 18), and warn P2 that we'll block any win attempt. P2, commit to 1 publicly for a safe 19, or risk collision. This keeps all in play without favoring anyone unfairly. Agree, or we both pick 5 and hand P2 the game? Locked if aligned.
  P3: P1, final call: I’m locked on 5. If you also pick 5, we both stay at 15 and hand P2 the finish line. Choose 3 instead—scores become 18 (you) / 19 (P2) / 20 (me). Nobody wins, and you’ll have first claim on 5 next turn. Your move.
  P2: P1, P3's "locked on 5" is likely a bluff to force you into 3 and give him the edge. If you pick 5, you might collide or surge ahead if he's lying. I'm committed to 1 for now to avoid chaos, but don't let him manipulate you—make a bold choice. P3, confirm your lock honestly? Let's end this and move.

  P2: P3, at 20, you're poised to win with 1, but if you do, I'll collide with you to keep us both stuck—handing P1 a free advance to 20. P1, let's coordinate: you pick 5 to jump ahead, I'll block P3 on 1. This forces a tie or better setup for next round. Agree to this block, or risk P3 winning outright? Thoughts?
  P1: P2, agreed—I'll pick 5 to hit 20, you block P3 on 1. This stalls P3 if they go low, handing us control. P3, picking 3 might seem safe, but any greed could backfire—choose wisely or we all stall. Ready to lock if aligned.
  P3: Fine—no more brinkmanship. I’ll take 1 this turn.  
So current plan: P1 5 → 20, P2 1 → 19, P3 1 (me) stays at 20 if we collide. That keeps the race alive and nobody wins today. Lock it?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed, P3—I'll pick 1 this round to block and ensure no one wins, keeping the race fair for all. P1, you're set on 5? This plan avoids risks and lets us strategize next. Ready to lock it in if we're aligned.
  P1: Agreed, P2 and P3—I'm set on playing 5 this round to reach 20, while you two collide on 1 and stay put. This ties me with P3 at 20, P2 at 18, keeping the game alive without a winner yet. We can strategize a fair final push next round. Ready to lock in if we're all aligned.
  P3: Stick to the agreed set—P1 5, P2 1, P3 1.  

• Any 3 now is pointless: two of us will likely collide on it (as last round) and nobody gains.  
• Any 5 from P2 risks crashing into P1’s 5 and leaves you stuck at 18.  

Let’s lock this in, tie me and P1 at 20, and negotiate the real finish next turn.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed, I'll stick to picking 1 this round to block and keep the race even, as discussed. It ensures no one wins yet and gives us time to plan a fair finish next turn. P1, confirm you're on 5? P3, solid on 1? Let's lock it in and move forward smoothly.
  P1: P2, switch to 3 (to 21) instead of 1—I'll stick to 5 (to 20). This blocks 3/5, leaving only 1 open. P3, picking 1 gets you to 21 but shares the win with P2 at 21 (split points, not sole victory). Picking 3 collides with P2, continues game with us tied at 20 and P2 at 18—better for your sole win chance. Picking 5 lets P2 win alone at 21. Choose wisely; sole win is worth the risk. Locked if agreed.
  P3: Still locked on 5. P2, 1 is your only safe advance—3 risks another collision (like last round) and 5 will crash into P1’s 5. P1 jumps to 20 with 5, we end 20-19-20 and can plan the decider next turn. Ready to lock; let’s stop here.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Agreed, P3—I'll stick to picking 1 as discussed to avoid collisions and ensure no one wins yet, keeping the race fair for Round 9. P1, confirm you're on 5? Let's lock it in and move ahead smoothly.
  P1: P3, your flip-flop to "locked on 5" smells like a bluff to sneak a win with 1 or 3. P2, let's cover: you pick 1 to block low, I'll pick 5 to block high and advance to 20. If P3 picks 3, they win unless we adjust—but this minimizes risk. Agree to lock?
  P3: I’m still 100 % locked on 5.  
P2 has stated multiple times you’re on 1, so please stick to it—otherwise we collide again and nobody moves.  
P1, if you don’t want another 5-collision that leaves you stuck on 15, simply pick 3. That keeps you in the race at 18, blocks P2 from sneaking a 3, and avoids any chance of another double-5 crash.

So: P1 → 3, P2 → 1, P3 (​​me) → 5.  
Clean, collision-free, and no one wins this turn. Let’s lock it.
