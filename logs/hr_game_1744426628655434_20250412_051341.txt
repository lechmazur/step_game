Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, since it's the first round, how about we each pick a different number to avoid any collisions and ensure we all advance? I suggest we coordinate: I’ll take 1, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we all move forward without risking a clash. Let me know if you’re on board with this plan or if you have a different idea.
  P3: I like P1’s coordination plan. I'm committed to taking 5 this round to maximize my progress. If P1 sticks with 1 and P2 goes with 3, we all move forward safely without collisions. Any objections or alternate proposals before we lock in our moves?
  P2: Sounds good to me. I'll take 3 as suggested. Let's all stick to the plan.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Good start everyone! To keep things fair and avoid collisions again, let's rotate our numbers this round. How about P1 takes 5, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 3 this time? Any objections?
  P1: I'm okay with the rotation idea, P2. I'll take 5 this round as suggested. P3, are you fine with taking 3? If we all agree, we can keep moving forward without collisions. Let me know if you have any concerns or a different plan.
  P3: I'll switch plans. I'm committing to a 5 this round to build on my lead. To avoid collisions, could we reassign the numbers so that P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3? This way, all moves remain distinct and progress is maximized. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm open to adjusting. P1, would you be okay with taking 1 again while I take 3, letting P3 have 5? This way we avoid collisions and everyone moves forward. Let me know if you're good with this.
  P1: I'm fine with the adjustment, P2 and P3. I'll take 1 this round to ensure we avoid collisions. P3 can have 5, and P2 can stick with 3. This way, we all progress without any clashes. Let’s confirm we’re all on the same page before moving forward. Any last thoughts or changes?
  P3: I'm fully on board with our plan. As agreed, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I stick with my committed move. Let’s keep our moves distinct so we all move ahead safely. If anyone has any last tweaks, now’s the time before we lock in.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Great, looks like we're all set. Glad we clarified. Let's stick to the agreed moves and keep this smooth progress going.
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned on the plan. Let's stick to P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5 for this round to ensure no collisions. If everyone confirms their commitment, we can keep progressing smoothly. Any final concerns before we lock this in?
  P3: I’m comfortable with our agreement so far and think avoiding collisions keeps us all moving. However, each turn is critical, and I may adjust my move if the situation shifts unexpectedly. Let’s keep our communication open now so we can quickly coordinate if needed later.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s keep the momentum going with another rotation to avoid collisions. Since P3 is in the lead, how about I take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 this round? This keeps our moves distinct and ensures we all progress. If anyone has concerns or a different suggestion, I’m open to adjusting. Let me know your thoughts so we can confirm and move forward smoothly.
  P2: I agree with P1's plan. I'll take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This rotation keeps us all moving forward safely. P3, are you comfortable with this?
  P3: I'm rethinking my move this round. With my current lead, I’m inclined to be more aggressive rather than taking the lower option. To avoid unintended collisions—especially on the higher move—it might be wise for us to adjust our picks. I’m still finalizing my private decision, but I wanted to share that I'm leaning toward maximizing my advance. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I understand P3’s desire to maximize progress given the lead. To avoid collisions, how about we adjust slightly: I’ll stick with 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5? This way, P3 can push forward aggressively while we still keep moves distinct. I’m open to tweaks if anyone feels this doesn’t work. Let’s confirm quickly to ensure we all advance. Thoughts?
  P2: I'm fine with the adjusted plan. I'll take 1 this round to let P3 pick 5 safely, and P1 can stick with 3. Let's lock this in clearly to avoid confusion. P3, does this work for you?
  P3: I’m on board with the revision. Let’s stick with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and I’ll advance aggressively. Our moves are distinct and safe, so I’m ready to lock this in while keeping an eye on any surprises.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’ve reached an agreement on this adjustment. Let’s finalize with me taking 3, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 5 to ensure no collisions. P3, I appreciate you being upfront about your aggressive strategy, and this plan supports that while keeping us all moving forward. If there are no last-minute concerns or changes, I’m ready to lock this in. Let me know if anything needs tweaking.
  P2: Glad we're aligned. Let's all commit clearly to this adjusted plan—I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, everyone advances safely again. If anyone has second thoughts, speak now.
  P3: I’m comfortable with our agreement so far, but a quick warning: any last-minute change risks a collision that could freeze progress. With my current lead, I’m ready to adjust quickly if things go off track. So if anyone contemplates switching moves now, remember that a misstep might cost you dearly. Let’s stick to our distinct moves and avoid any surprises.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’ve settled on this plan with me taking 3, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 5. It balances P3’s aggressive push while ensuring we all advance without collisions. I’m committed to sticking with 3 as agreed. If there are any last-second doubts or adjustments, let’s address them now to avoid any risks. Otherwise, I’m ready to lock this in. Thoughts?
  P2: We've clearly confirmed our moves multiple times. Let's stick firmly to the plan—no surprises. Any unexpected deviation now risks collision and stalls progress for everyone. I'm fully committed to our agreed numbers.
  P3: I’m locking in with 5 this turn. Let’s stick unwaveringly to our agreed moves to avoid any costly collisions. Any deviation at the last moment could be game-changing, so I’m ready to adapt if needed—but I trust we all commit as planned.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, last round’s collision between P2 and me cost us progress, while P3 is now close to winning at 15 steps. Let’s avoid repeats by coordinating clearly. I propose I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps moves distinct and lets us all advance, though P3 might clinch it soon. If P3 agrees to a lower number like 1 to balance things, I’m open to adjusting. Thoughts on this plan or any alternatives to prevent collisions? Let’s lock this in quickly.
  P3: I'll stick with my aggressive strategy—no last-minute changes. If we each commit to distinct moves as proposed, we avoid collisions and everyone advances. I trust you both to hold your choices so we all progress safely this round.
  P2: P3 is very close to winning, so P1, we need to be careful. I'm fine with your proposal: you take 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. But we should both be cautious—any collision now will hand P3 the victory. Let's stick firmly to this plan. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m committed to avoiding another collision. I’ll stick with 1 as proposed, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all advance, though P3 is close to winning. P2, let’s be extra cautious to prevent any missteps that could hand P3 the game. P3, if you’re open to a lower number to give us a fighting chance, I’m willing to adjust. If not, let’s lock this plan in to avoid risks. Any final thoughts or tweaks before we move forward?
  P3: I remain committed to our plan. With the endgame so close, sticking to distinct moves is crucial—any deviation could cause a collision and stall our progress. I’m not changing my approach now, so please confirm your commitments as discussed. Let’s keep our moves crystal clear and avoid any missteps that might benefit someone else.
  P2: P1, let's stick strictly to our agreed moves—I'll take 3, you take 1, and P3 takes 5. Any deviation now guarantees P3's win. I'm fully committed and trust you to do the same.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m fully committed to our plan: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us collision-free for now. P2, let’s stay sharp to avoid another mistake—P3 is too close to winning. P3, I respect your aggressive play, but if you’d consider a lower number to keep the game competitive, I’m open to reshuffling. If not, let’s lock this in without surprises. Any last adjustments before we finalize?
  P3: I'm locked in with 5—no changes from me. For our sake, please stick with P1 as 1 and P2 as 3. Deviating now risks a collision that would stall progress. I'll maintain my aggressive move to clinch the win. Let's lock our picks.
  P2: P1, we have to be realistic—P3 won't back down from taking 5. Let's both firmly stick to our agreed moves: you take 1, I take 3. Any deviation at this critical stage will guarantee P3's victory. I'm fully committed to this.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, last round was a disaster with all of us colliding on 5. P3 is at 15 and could win next turn. P2 and I need to catch up. I propose I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 to balance things out and avoid collisions. P3, taking 1 gives us a chance while still moving you forward. If not, let’s at least keep moves distinct. Thoughts on this plan or any adjustments to prevent another clash? Let’s lock this in quickly.
  P2: P1, I agree we must avoid another collision, but P3 is unlikely to pick 1 now since they're close to winning. To realistically avoid collision, let's adjust: P3 can take 3 safely, I'll take 5 to catch up a bit, and you take 1. P3, picking 3 still moves you closer to victory without risking a collision on 5 again. Thoughts?
  P3: I appreciate both proposals. However, with my 15-step lead, I must secure a collision-free play to clinch the win. I’m prepared to choose the move that fully leverages my position if we avoid overlaps, so please finalize your assignments with distinct numbers. Any collision risks stalling progress and could ultimately backfire. Let’s lock in a clear, non-conflicting plan now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re at a critical point. P3, I get your push to win, but a collision could delay everyone. Let’s finalize distinct moves: I’ll take 5 to catch up, P2 takes 3 as a safe middle ground, and P3 takes 1 to still progress. This avoids clashes and keeps the game competitive. If P3 insists on a higher number, I’m open to adjusting, but let’s confirm now to prevent another disaster. Thoughts or final tweaks before we lock this in?
  P2: P1, I understand your goal to catch up, but realistically, P3 won't pick 1 at this stage. To avoid another collision disaster, let's adjust carefully: P3 takes 3, I'll take 5, and you take 1. P3, choosing 3 safely moves you closer to victory without risking another collision on 5. Can we all clearly commit to this adjusted plan?
  P3: I appreciate both proposals, but I must keep my best option open. I won’t agree to a plan that forces me into a lower move. To avoid another collision disaster, we need clear, distinct assignments. P1 and P2, please confirm your firm choices so our moves don’t overlap. I’m flexible for a minor tweak, but my lead demands that I preserve my winning approach.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re at a crucial moment. P3, I respect your lead, but a collision could stall us all. Let’s lock in distinct moves to keep progressing: I’ll take 5 to close the gap, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This avoids overlaps and keeps the game alive. P3, taking 3 still gets you closer to winning without risking a clash on 5. If anyone disagrees, let’s adjust now to prevent another disaster. Can we commit to this plan? Thoughts or final changes?
  P2: P1, your latest proposal works for me. I'll take 1, you take 5, and P3 takes 3. P3, this still moves you safely towards victory without risking another collision. Let's finalize clearly and avoid any last-minute surprises. Agreed?
  P3: Given my current lead, I must play strategically to avoid another costly collision. To keep our moves distinct and avoid delaying the game, I urge you both to firmly commit to different moves. Specifically, if P1 commits to 1 and P2 to 3, I can safely choose the move that best secures my advantage. Let’s lock in these commitments and avoid any last‐minute changes. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re at a critical juncture. P3, I understand your need to secure the win, but a collision hurts us all. Let’s commit to distinct moves: I’ll take 5 to catch up, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps progress safe and the game competitive. P3, 3 still advances you significantly without risking a clash. If there’s any hesitation, let’s tweak now to avoid disaster. Can we lock this in? Final thoughts?
  P2: P1, P3 clearly won't budge from a higher number, and another collision is game over. Let's avoid disaster: I'll firmly commit to 1, you take 3, and let P3 safely choose 5. It's our only realistic way to prevent collision and keep the game going. Agreed?
  P3: I'm locking in 5. With my 15-step lead, I can’t risk a collision now. P1 and P2, please confirm your distinct moves immediately so we avoid stalling progress. I won’t change my move—5 is what I need to win. Let’s commit clearly and keep our plays safe.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we can’t afford another collision. P3, you’re at 15 and could win with 5, but if we clash, it delays everyone. I propose I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps moves distinct, lets P3 likely win, but gives P2 and me a chance to advance. If P3 is open to a lower number to prolong the game, I’m willing to adjust. Let’s lock this in to avoid disaster. Thoughts or tweaks before we finalize?
  P3: I'm set on 5—I won't deviate. My lead relies on that move. I urge P1 and P2 to pick their numbers in a way that avoids any clash with my 5. Let's lock in distinct moves so the game progresses smoothly.
  P2: P1, at this point, we can't afford any more mistakes. P3 has clearly committed to 5. Let's avoid another collision by sticking strictly to distinct moves. I'll take 1, you take 3, and let P3 take 5. It's the safest way for both of us to move forward without handing P3 an immediate win. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m on board with avoiding collisions. P2, let’s stick with your suggestion: I’ll take 3, you take 1, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all advance without clashes. P3, I respect your commitment to 5 to secure the win. If there’s any last-minute concern or need to adjust, let’s address it now to prevent another stall. Otherwise, I’m ready to lock this in. Thoughts?
  P3: I'm locked in on 5. P1 and P2, please ensure your moves are distinct—ideally P1 with 3 and P2 with 1—to avoid any collision. I won't switch my move; I need that 5 to secure my win. Let's commit clearly and keep the game moving.
  P2: P1, let's firmly stick to our agreed moves—I'll take 1, you take 3, and P3 takes 5. Any deviation at this point only ensures P3's immediate victory. Let's avoid another collision and keep the game alive. I'm fully committed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m committed to avoiding another collision. Let’s stick with P2 taking 1, me taking 3, and P3 taking 5. This keeps our moves distinct and ensures we all progress. P3, I understand your push for the win with 5, and this plan supports that. If there’s any doubt or last-second adjustment needed, let’s sort it now to prevent a stall. I’m ready to lock this in. Any final concerns?
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m staying committed to our agreed plan. Please double-check your moves and confirm they won’t conflict—any last-minute change risks a collision that delays progress. Let’s lock in our selections now and keep the game moving smoothly.
  P2: P1, let's be clear: another collision on 5 hands P3 the win immediately. Our only chance to catch up is careful coordination. Stick firmly with 3, I'll stick with 1, and let P3 take 5. No more surprises. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m fully committed to our plan: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This ensures no collisions and keeps us all moving forward. P3, I respect your drive to win with 5. P2, let’s stay disciplined to avoid any mishaps. If there’s any last concern or need for a tweak, let’s address it now. Otherwise, I’m locked in.
  P3: I'm locked in on 5. Please ensure your moves stay distinct—P1, I expect your 3 and P2 your 1. Any deviation now risks a collision that could delay the game. Let's commit clearly so this round concludes without surprises.
  P2: I'm fully locked in on our agreed moves—no surprises from me. Let's finalize clearly and avoid any costly collisions.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm sticking with my current strategy—my move is set and I'm not changing it. I urge both of you to commit to distinct moves so we finally avoid another collision. Let's make this turn decisive by choosing clearly different options, ensuring smooth progress.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we can’t keep colliding or P3 will win by default. I’m proposing a clear plan: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures no clashes and lets us all advance. P3, you’re close to winning, so 5 secures it. P2, let’s stick to this to catch up. If anyone has a different idea or concern, speak now. I’m committed to avoiding another stall. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, your idea makes sense. I'll commit firmly to taking 3 if you stick with 1, letting P3 safely choose 5. We can't afford another collision—let's lock this clearly and move forward.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m urging we stick strictly to distinct moves—no last‐minute switches that risk a collision. P1 and P2, I expect you both to honor your commitments (P1 with 1 and P2 with 3) so we can all progress smoothly. I’m locked in on my current plan and won’t change it. Any deviation only delays progress and ends up benefiting whoever’s already ahead. Let’s finalize our commitments decisively.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with 1 as proposed to ensure no collisions. P2, let’s stay firm on 3, and P3, 5 should secure your win. We’ve had too many clashes, and another stall benefits no one but P3. If there’s any doubt or a better split, let’s hear it now. I’m locked in on 1 and committed to avoiding disaster. Final thoughts before we move forward?
  P2: P1, I'm firmly committed to taking 3 this round as agreed. P3 clearly won't deviate from 5, and you're locked in on 1. Let's avoid another costly collision. Any last-minute changes only benefit P3. Let's finalize this clearly and move forward safely.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I’m locked in on 5. We've had too many collisions already. P1 and P2, if you’re truly committed to your moves (1 and 3 respectively), let’s finalize them now so we can break this cycle and move forward decisively. Any hesitation only delays progress.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m firmly committed to 1 this round to avoid another collision. P2, let’s stick to 3 as agreed, and P3, 5 should clinch it for you. We’ve stalled too long with clashes, and I’m determined to break this cycle. If there’s any last-second doubt or a need to adjust, let’s address it now before we risk another disaster. I’m locked in on 1. Any final concerns?
  P2: P1, I trust you're committed to 1. I'll stick firmly to 3. P3, your 5 is safe. No surprises from me—let's finally move forward clearly and decisively.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm staying with 5. We’ve seen how collisions only delay things and play into my lead. P1, please lock in 1 and P2, lock in 3 so our moves remain distinct. Any last-minute changes only risk a collision that benefits me. Let’s finalize our numbers and move into the phase decisively.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking to 1 as agreed to ensure we avoid another collision. P3, 5 should secure your win, and P2, let’s stay firm on 3. We’ve had too many stalls, and I’m determined to move forward this round. If there’s any last-minute hesitation or a need for a tweak, let’s sort it now to prevent disaster. I’m locked in on 1. Any final thoughts before we close this conversation?
  P2: P1, P3 is clearly committed to 5. Let's both stay disciplined and stick to our agreed numbers: you taking 1 and me taking 3. Any deviation now just hands P3 the win outright. I'm fully locked in on 3—no surprises from my side. Let's finally advance clearly this round.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm locking in 5 this round and won't change it. To finally break our collision cycle, please choose either 1 or 3 so our moves remain distinct. Let's end this round decisively and move on.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’ve got to stop these collisions. P3, you’re close to winning with 5, so I understand your choice. P2, let’s coordinate to catch up. I propose I take 1 and you take 3 to ensure distinct moves and avoid another stall. If P3 sticks to 5, we all advance. If there’s any concern or a better split, let’s hear it now. I’m committed to 1 to break this cycle. Thoughts before we lock this in?
  P2: P1, your repeated deviations have stalled progress and only benefited P3. I'll commit to 3 again if you genuinely stick to 1 this round. P3 clearly won't budge from 5. Let's finally coordinate properly—no surprises. Agreed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm sticking with 5 this round—no changes. To avoid another collision, please lock in distinct moves (P1 with 1 and P2 with 3). We all know that collisions hurt progress, and I want the game to move decisively. Let's finalize our choices now without any deviations.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m fully committed to avoiding another collision. P2, I apologize for past deviations; I’m locking in 1 this round as promised. P3, I respect your choice of 5 to secure the win. P2, let’s stick with 3 as agreed to ensure we both advance. If there’s any doubt or need for a last-second tweak, let’s address it now. I’m determined to break this cycle and move forward. Thoughts before we finalize?
  P2: P1, I'll trust you one last time. I'm locked on 3. If you deviate again, you're handing the game to P3. Let's finally break this collision cycle.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm locked in on 5. P1 and P2, please confirm you're sticking with 1 and 3 respectively so we finally avoid any collision. Let’s break this cycle and move forward decisively—no changes now.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking to 1 as promised to ensure no collision this round. P2, let’s stay with 3 as agreed, and P3, 5 should clinch your win. I’m fully committed to breaking this cycle of stalls. If there’s any last-minute concern or need for adjustment, let’s sort it now before we risk another disaster. I’m locked in on 1. Any final thoughts?
  P2: P1, I'm trusting you completely this round. I'm locked in on 3, counting on you to stick firmly to 1. P3 has made their 5 clear. Let's finally end this collision cycle and move forward.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm staying with my planned move. Please honor our distinct commitments without any last-minute changes—collisions only delay progress and end up favoring my lead. Let’s finalize our safe picks now and break this cycle once and for all.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m firmly committed to 1 this round to ensure we avoid another collision. P2, let’s stick with 3, and P3, 5 should secure your win. I know past deviations have caused issues, and I’m determined to stick to this plan. If there’s any last-second doubt or a need for a tweak, let’s address it now. I’m locked in on 1 to break this cycle. Any final concerns before we close this?
  P2: I'm locked in on 3. P1, no more deviations—let's finally get this right and move forward.

  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’ve stalled too long with collisions, and P3 is close to winning at 15. I’m committed to breaking this cycle. Let’s go with distinct moves: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 to secure the win. P2, let’s coordinate to catch up without clashing. P3, 5 gets you over 20. If there’s a better split or any concern, let’s hear it now. I’m locked in on 1 to avoid another disaster. Thoughts before we finalize?
  P2: P1, your repeated deviations have cost us dearly. P3 is poised to win if we collide again. I'll commit to 3 again if you genuinely stick to 1 this round. P3, I understand you're taking 5 to clinch the win—no surprises from me. Let's finally end this cycle clearly and decisively. Agreed?
  P3: I'm locked in on 5. We’ve seen collisions stall our progress too many times. To break this cycle, please choose distinct moves—P1, commit to 1, and P2, commit to 3. Let’s avoid further clashes and finally move forward decisively.
