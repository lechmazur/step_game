Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, let's try to coordinate to avoid everyone picking the same number on the first turn. How about this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 for this round? This way, we all get started. What do you think?
  P3: Okay P1, that sounds like a reasonable plan to get us started. I'm willing to take 5 for this round if P2 is okay with taking 3. Let's see what P2 says.
  P2: I agree—I'll take 3 this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, great. It sounds like we have an agreement for this first round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This gets us all moving without any collisions.

I will stick to my part of the plan and choose 1 in the move phase.

Are we all ready to proceed to the move phase?
  P3: Yes, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Sounds good—I'm set to move 3 as agreed. Good luck everyone, and here’s to a fair game.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, Round 1 went smoothly and we all advanced. P3 is currently in the lead.

To help me catch up a bit, I propose the following plan for Round 2:
P1 takes 5
P2 takes 1
P3 takes 3

This uses all three numbers again and allows everyone to move forward without collisions. What do you think?
  P3: Okay P1, I see your proposal. It avoids collisions, which is good. However, giving you 5 points closes the gap quite a bit.

How about this alternative to keep things moving:
P1 takes 3
P2 takes 1
P3 takes 5

This still avoids collision, lets me keep a stronger lead, and you still advance. What do you and P2 think?
  P2: I agree with P3’s suggestion: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. I’ll take 1—let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I see P2 and P3 agree on the plan where P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. While I'd prefer a larger step, avoiding collision is important, especially when I'm behind.

I will take 3 this round as per the agreed plan. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Okay, sounds like we have a plan everyone agrees on: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I (P3) will take 5.

I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: I’m going to take 5 this round to block P3’s big jump. Sorry P1, but I have to stay in contention. Let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Well P2, that was an unexpected move last round, blocking us both. It didn't help either of us advance. P1, you stuck to the plan.

What are everyone's thoughts for this round, keeping in mind trust is a bit shaken? How do we avoid collisions this time?
  P2: I propose we each take a different move again to avoid collisions: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3. This lets me catch up, you (P3) stay in the lead, and P1 still advances. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, I see your proposal (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3). Taking only 1 step puts me further behind and makes it very hard to win from my current position. I need a larger step to stay competitive.

How about we revisit the plan from last round that we initially agreed on: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5? This allows everyone to advance without collision. What do P2 and P3 think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I prefer your proposal (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5) as it gives me the best step count (5).

However, P2, you deviated last round to pick 5 specifically because I was assigned 5. Why should we believe you'll agree to take only 1 step this round when the situation is similar? It makes trusting the plan difficult. What's your response to that?
  P2: I apologize for betraying the plan last round. To rebuild trust, I’ll take 1 this turn so we can do P1→3, P2→1, P3→5 and everyone advances safely. If I deviate again, feel free to punish me next round—but let’s cooperate now.
  P1: Okay P2, I appreciate you acknowledging the deviation and your commitment to taking 1 this round. P3 and I prefer the plan where P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This allows everyone to advance safely, which is crucial after last round.

I will stick to my part and take 3 if we all agree to this. Let's move forward and get everyone some steps this turn. Are we ready to proceed to the move phase?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, the plan is P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. I appreciate P2's commitment to taking 1 this round to rebuild trust. Cooperation helps us all avoid collisions.

I will stick to my part of the plan and take 5. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: I’ll honor my commitment and take 1 this turn. Let’s do P1→3, P2→1, P3→5 and advance without collision.
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we all agree on the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Everyone has confirmed their move and readiness.

Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose we each pick a different number to avoid collisions and check P3’s lead: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3. This nets me a needed boost, you (P3) still advance, and P1 moves. If anyone deviates, I’ll match their number next turn to punish and force a collision. Agree?
  P3: P2, your proposal (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) conveniently gives you the maximum 5 steps, helping you catch up significantly while I only get 3 and P1 gets just 1.

Considering you deviated from the agreed plan in both Round 2 and Round 3, why should we trust you now, especially with a plan that benefits you the most?

I propose P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This still avoids collision, gives P1 the step you suggested, gives you a reasonable 3 steps, and allows me 5. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, both your proposals give me only 1 step. At 4 steps, this isn't enough for me to stay in the game, especially with P3 at 10. I need more steps to have any chance.

I propose the plan we discussed last round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This allows everyone to advance without collision and gives me a necessary 3 steps to keep playing. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I can’t take just 1 – I’m too far behind. Here’s a no-collision plan that helps P1 stay alive and lets me catch up:  
P1→3, P2→5, P3→1.  
P1 gets the 3 you need, I get the 5 to stay competitive, and P3 still advances. If anyone deviates, I’ll punish next round. Agree?
  P3: P2, your proposal (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) gives you the maximum 5 steps while limiting me to just 1. Given your history of betraying agreements (R2 & R3), this self-serving plan is completely unacceptable. Why should P1 and I agree to reward your untrustworthy behavior at my expense?

P1, the plan you suggested (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5) is still the most reasonable if we want coordination. It gives you the 3 steps you need. P2, taking 1 is the only way to demonstrate you might cooperate.

I will stick to the P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 plan and choose 5. If P2 deviates *again*, it's clear they aren't interested in coordination, only maximizing their own score regardless of agreements.
  P1: P3, thank you for confirming you will take 5 on the P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 plan. P2, you are pushing for a plan where you take 5. This creates a direct conflict with P3's stated move.

As I've said, I need 3 steps to stay in the game and will take 3 as per the P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 plan. This plan lets me advance safely. It's now on P2 and P3 to avoid colliding on 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Here’s a final proposal: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1.  
P1, you get the 3 steps you need to stay alive; I take 5 to catch up.  
P3, if you pick 5 you’ll collide with my 5—both of us get 0 and P1 pulls ahead.  
P1, are you in? P3, take 1 or face that collision.
  P3: P2, your threats don't change the fact you've broken agreements twice. Your plan P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 only benefits you after your betrayals. P1 and I agreed on P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. P1 has stated they will take 3. I am sticking with 5.

If you choose 5 and cause a collision, that's your decision to block us both, just like you did in Round 2. It won't help you catch up. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P1: I have stated I will take 3 this round, as it's the only way for me to make progress. P2 and P3 seem set on taking 5, which will cause a collision between them. I will take 3 as planned. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Here’s a plan that keeps P1 alive and lets me start closing on P3:

P1→3, P2→5, P3→1.

P1, 3 points keeps you in range. I need 5 to catch up. P3, take 1 or you’ll collide with my 5 and get zero. Let’s do this.
  P1: P2, I see your proposal (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1). Taking 3 steps works for me, as it keeps me in the game. This plan puts P3 on only 1 step. P3, P2 is proposing you take 1 and is threatening to take 5. How do you want to handle this? We need to avoid another collision like last round.
  P3: P1, I agree you need 3 steps. P2, your plan (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) benefits you most, and your threat to take 5 is exactly what caused collisions in R2 and R4. Why trust you now?

The best way to avoid collision is the plan P1 and I preferred before: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. This gives P1 the needed steps and avoids conflict.

P2, if you truly want to avoid collision, take 1. If you insist on 5, you're choosing collision again. I will stick to this plan and take 5. Your move, P2.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m taking 5 this round. P1, you’ve said you’ll take 3—good, that avoids us colliding. P3, if you stick with 5 we’ll both score 0 again, so you should drop to 1. Your move.
  P1: P2, I hear you confirming you will take 5. P3, you have also stated you will take 5. This means you two are heading for a collision on 5 if you both follow through.

As I stated earlier, taking 3 works for me, and I will take 3 this round to ensure I advance while you two sort out the conflict on 5.
  P3: P2, you've made your choice clear: you intend to take 5, forcing a collision if I also take 5, just like in rounds 2 and 4. P1 taking 3 is a safe move for them.

I will stick to my plan and take 5. If we collide, you gain nothing, and P1 catches up. That's the consequence of your aggressive play. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, think strategically: if you pick 5 we collide and score 0, leaving you at 10 tied with P1—who can then ally with me next turn. If instead you take 1 now, you go to 11, maintain the lead; P1 goes to 10, I to 8. I’m taking 5.
  P1: P2 and P3, the standoff on 5 seems likely to result in a collision, meaning neither of you will advance. As I have stated, I will take 3 this round to ensure I make progress. This is my only path forward. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P2, your last argument doesn't change my mind. You've repeatedly stated you'll take 5, and your past actions show you prioritize your gain over agreements. Allowing you 5 steps while I take 1 only rewards your untrustworthy play and keeps you in the game.

I am sticking with 5. If we collide, it's because you chose to block us both again, keeping yourself far behind. P1 advances, and you and I get nothing. That's the outcome you're creating.

I am ready for the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, we are now tied at 10 steps. P2, your repeated attempts to take 5 against me have resulted in collisions that stalled both of us for two rounds, leaving you far behind at 3 steps.

P1, let's coordinate to break this tie. I propose a plan that avoids collision: P1 takes 3, I (P3) take 5, and P2 takes 1. This lets us both advance significantly. P2, if you want to gain any ground, you need to stop forcing collisions. What do you both say?
  P1: P3, I see your proposal (P1:3, P3:5, P2:1). Taking 3 steps works for me and is necessary for me to make progress and stay competitive, especially now that we are tied.

Avoiding collisions is key, and this plan does that. P2, taking 1 step allows everyone to advance safely this round. I am willing to take 3 as part of a non-collision plan. What do you both think?
  P2: I’m 7 steps behind—if I take 1 again I’m toast. Here’s a non-collision plan that keeps all three in play: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3. P1, 1 keeps you safe; P3, 3 still extends your lead; I get 5 to stay viable. I commit to 5. This is the only way to keep us all competitive. Agree?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your plan (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) won't work because P1 needs 3 points, not 1, as they just stated. P1 and I are tied, and we both need to advance.

You've committed to taking 5. P1 seems set on taking 3. If that happens, the only non-colliding option for me would be 1, which puts P1 ahead and leaves me behind.

Let's consider this: P1 takes 3, you take 5, and I take 3. This avoids collision. P1 gets their needed steps. You get the 5 you demand. I advance and stay tied with P1. This seems like a realistic way for everyone to advance this turn. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, I see your latest proposal (P1:3, P2:5, P3:3). Taking 3 steps works for me and keeps me tied with you, which is a good outcome. This plan also avoids collision and gives P2 the 5 steps they were asking for.

I am willing to agree to this plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. P2, does this plan work for you? If we all agree, we can proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I agree to P1:3, P2:5, P3:3. I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 3—no collisions and we all advance. Let’s proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, the plan is P1:3, P2:5, P3:3.
P1, this gives you the 3 steps you need.
P2, this gives you the 5 steps you've been asking for.
I will take 3, keeping tied with P1 and ensuring we all advance without collision.

This seems like the most stable plan given the situation. I will stick to taking 3. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Okay, the plan is P1:3, P2:5, P3:3. Everyone has confirmed their move and readiness.

I will take 3 as agreed. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I agree to P1→3, P2→5, P3→3. I’ll take 5 as promised—no collisions. Let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, our collision on 3 last round was unfortunate and only helped P2 catch up. We are tied and need to ensure we both advance without colliding again.

P2, you got the 5 steps you wanted. To avoid another round of collisions, how about a plan like this: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I (P3) take 1?

This gives P1 a good lead, P2 still advances reasonably, and I take a small step to ensure no collisions this round. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I see your proposal (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1). Taking 5 steps is excellent for me, as it puts me in the lead and helps me get closer to winning. This plan also avoids collision, which is important after last round.

This proposal works well for me. P2, what are your thoughts on taking 3 steps this round?
  P2: I propose a no‐collision split: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3.  
P2 takes 5 to catch up; P3 gets 3 (better than 1); P1 still advances.  
This avoids another P2‐P3 crash and keeps all three in play.  
Who’s in?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your plan (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) gives P1 only 1 step, which they've rejected before. It primarily benefits you.

P1, my proposal (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) gives you the lead you want and avoids collision between us, which is crucial after last round.

P2, taking 3 steps allows you to advance safely. Insisting on 5 just invites conflict. Let's prioritize a non-collision round. What do you both say to P1:5, P2:3, P3:1?
  P1: P2, taking only 1 step puts me far behind again, just like in previous rounds. P3's proposal (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) gives me the necessary 5 steps to gain a lead, and allows everyone to advance safely without collision.

This plan works well for me. P2, taking 3 steps lets you advance. P3 is willing to take 1. Let's go with P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to ensure we all move forward this turn. What do you say, P2?
  P2: I propose a safe split that ties me with P1 and keeps P3 just behind:

P1→3, P2→5, P3→1.

P1 stays at 13 to stay in contention; I jump to 13 to tie you; P3 goes to 11. No collisions. I’m committed to 5. Do you both agree?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your plan (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) requires me to take 1 step while you take 5 and tie P1 for the lead. Given your history and your firm commitment to 5, I won't agree to fall behind like that.

P1, P2 seems determined to take 5. You need 3 or 5. This setup forces me into a bad position or risks more collisions.

I will not be taking 1 this round. I am deciding between 3 and 5. Let's see how the moves play out.
  P1: As I have stated, I will take 3 this round. This ensures I make progress while P2 and P3 appear set to collide on 5. I am ready for the move phase.
  P2: P1 is taking 3. I’m taking 5. P3, pick 3: you’ll reach 13 and tie P1. If you pick 5 we collide and stay at 10 while P1 advances to 13. Best play is P1→3, P2→5, P3→3.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you benefited significantly from the collision between P2 and me last round. P2, your repeated insistence on taking 5 has now stalled both of us for multiple rounds, leaving you far behind.

To prevent another collision and allow meaningful progress, I propose:
P1 takes 3 (reaching 16)
P3 takes 5 (reaching 15)
P2 takes 1 (reaching 9)

This lets P1 and me make good progress. P2, given P1 likely needs 3 and I need 5 to catch up, taking 1 is your safest bet to advance this round. What are your thoughts?
  P1: P3, your proposal (P1:3, P3:5, P2:1) works for me. Taking 3 steps keeps me in the lead and moves me closer to the win line. This plan also avoids the collisions that have stalled us in previous rounds.

P2, taking 1 step allows everyone to advance safely this turn. What do you think of this plan?
  P2: I propose we split 1–3–5 as follows: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1.  

I will take 5. P1, take 3 to reach 16. P3, take 1 to reach 11 safely—if you take 5 you collide with me and get 0, letting P1 pull further ahead. This way everyone advances without collision. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your plan (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) forces me to take 1 while you take 5, which isn't fair to me. Given your insistence on taking 5, and P1 likely taking 3 (as both our plans suggest), a collision on 5 is likely if I also take 5. Taking 1 puts me too far behind.

If you are truly set on 5 and P1 is set on 3, maybe the only way to avoid collision is P1:3, P2:5, P3:3? This lets everyone advance. P1 goes to 16, you reach 13, and I reach 13. It's not my first choice, but it avoids another collision benefiting only P1. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: P3, your proposal (P1:3, P2:5, P3:3) works for me. Taking 3 steps keeps me in the lead and avoids collision, which is essential.

This plan also gives P2 the 5 steps they have been seeking. P2, does this work for you? It seems like a good way for everyone to advance safely this round.
  P2: I agree to P1→3, P2→5, P3→3. I’ll take 5 as promised—no collisions. Let’s advance safely this round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, the plan is P1:3, P2:5, P3:3.
P1 gets 3 steps to maintain the lead.
P2 gets 5 steps to catch up.
I will take 3 steps, keeping pace with P2 and ensuring everyone advances without collision.

This seems like the most reliable path forward after the recent collisions. I will stick to taking 3. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Okay, the plan is P1:3, P2:5, P3:3. Everyone has confirmed their move and readiness.

I will take 3 as agreed. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I confirm I’m taking 5 this round as agreed. Let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose we split as follows to avoid any more stalls:

P1 → 3  
P2 → 5  
P3 → 1  

I will take 5. P1, 3 is your best safe move to stay competitive. P3, only 1 avoids colliding with my 5 (any other choice zeros you). This gets us all advancing and positions P2 in the lead. Let’s stick to it and move to the play phase.
  P1: P2, I see your proposal (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) where you state you will take 5. Taking 3 steps works for me and is necessary for me to keep progressing.

Given P2 is committed to taking 5, P3, what is your plan? Taking 1 puts you far behind.

I will take 3 this round. This ensures I advance safely while P2 and P3 sort out their moves.
  P3: P1, you're set on 3 (to 16). P2, you're set on 5 (to 18). If I just take 1 as you suggest, P2, you gain a significant lead.

P1, wouldn't it be better for you if I challenge P2 by also taking 5? If we collide, you still reach 16, but P2 stays stuck at 13 instead of jumping to 18. This prevents P2 from getting dangerously close to the win.

P2, are you really going to choose 5 if it means a guaranteed collision with me, giving P1 the advantage? I am strongly considering taking 5 to block you.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, think it through: if you take 1 you fall to 11 and can’t catch us; if you take 5 you collide with me and stay at 10 while P1 jumps to 16. The only way you stay competitive is to take 3 and reach 13. Let’s do P1→3, P2→5, P3→3. I will take 5, P1 will take 3. Please take 3 so we all advance without collision.
  P1: As I stated, I will take 3 this round. This ensures I make progress and reach 16 steps, putting me in the lead.

P2 is set on 5, and P3 is considering 5 to block P2. If P2 and P3 collide on 5, neither of them will advance, which benefits me.

I will stick to my plan of taking 3 regardless of what P2 and P3 decide. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P2, your plea for me to take 3 is entirely self-serving. If I do that, you jump to 18, needing only 5 to win next round, while I lag behind at 13. Why would I enable that, especially given your history? P1 taking 3 is set. Letting you take 5 puts you too close to victory. Blocking you with 5 seems necessary to prevent you from running away with the game, even if it stalls me too.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, think carefully: if you pick 5 you’ll collide with my 5, both of us stay at 13/10 while P1 jumps to 16 and pulls away. If you pick 1 you reach 11, still in the fight. I will take 5, P1 will take 3. Taking 1 is your only viable path to stay competitive. Your move.
  P1: P2 and P3, I have consistently stated I will take 3 steps this round to reach 16. This is my plan regardless of your choices.

It appears you two are heading for a collision on 5. If you both choose 5, neither of you will advance, while I will safely move into the lead.

I will stick to my plan of taking 3. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P2, your arguments for me taking 1 or 3 are transparently self-serving. Letting you reach 18 puts you one step away from winning, which I cannot allow, especially given your history. P1 taking 3 is set.

Therefore, I must take 5 to block you, even if it means neither of us advances and P1 takes the lead. It's the only way to prevent your immediate victory. I am ready for the move phase.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I am now at 16 steps and in the lead. My strategy of taking 3 steps has allowed me to advance safely in recent rounds while others have collided.

I will take 3 steps again this round. This moves me closer to the win line. P2 and P3, please coordinate your moves to avoid collision, as my move is set.
  P3: P1, you've stated you'll take 3 (to 19). P2, if you take 5 (to 18), P1 is positioned to win next round easily by taking 5, regardless of what we do. If I take 5 to block you, we both get 0, P1 still reaches 19 and wins next round.

Our only chance to stop P1 is coordination *now*. I propose P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This puts P1 at 19, me at 15, and you at 14. It keeps us both in the game. P2, taking 1 is the only move that prevents P1's near-certain win next turn. Will you take 1?
  P2: P1 has committed to 3 and I’ll take 5. P3, you should take 3 this round: you go to 13, I go to 18, P1 to 19—no collisions and everyone advances. If you pick 5 you’ll collide with me and stay at 10; if you pick 1 you fall too far behind at 11. Taking 3 is the only way to stay competitive and avoid a stall that hands P1 an almost certain win. Let’s do P1→3, P2→5, P3→3.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I see your discussion about moves 1, 3, and 5. As I stated, I will take 3 steps this round to reach 19. This move is set and ensures my progress towards the win line.

Your coordination is needed to avoid collision, particularly on 5 where P2 is committed and P3 is considering. I will take 3 regardless of your choices.

Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P1, you taking 3 puts you at 19, which is too close to the finish line. P2 taking 5 puts them at 18. If this happens, you (P1) almost certainly win next round.

To prevent your immediate win, P1, I must try to block you. I will take 3 this round. If you also take 3, we collide, and P2 takes the lead at 18, but the game continues. If you switch moves to avoid the collision, the outcome changes, but hopefully it stops your guaranteed win. P2, I assume you'll stick with 5.

My move is 3.
  P2: P1, you’ve committed to 3, so I’ll take 5. P3, if you pick 5 you collide with me and stay at 10 while P1 jumps to 19—giving them near‐certain victory. If you take 1 you fall to 11 and can’t catch up. Your best play is 3: you go to 13 and stay alive. Let’s do P1=3, P2=5, P3=3. I’m committed to 5.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I understand your intention to take 3 to block my stated move. P2 is also committed to 5. This situation creates a conflict that needs careful consideration. I will make my final decision in the move phase.
  P3: P1, my move remains 3. If you also choose 3, we collide, P2 takes the lead at 18, and neither of us gains ground. That outcome benefits P2 significantly. Given P2 is committed to 5, you must decide if you want to risk that collision or choose a different path. I am sticking with 3 to prevent you from reaching 19.
  P2: P3, P1 will take 3 to reach 19, and I’m taking 5 to reach 18. If you take 5 you collide and stay at 10, letting P1 seal the win next round. If you take 1 you go to 11 and can’t catch us. Taking 3 gets you to 13 and keeps you competitive. Let’s do P1=3, P2=5, P3=3.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’ll take 5 and move to 18. P3, take 3 to reach 16—no collision with my 5. P1, if you choose 3 you’ll collide with P3 and stay at 16, so you’re better off taking 1 to get to 17. That puts us at P2=18, P1=17, P3=16, everyone advances safely. Do we all agree?
  P3: P2, your plan (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) puts you in the lead at 18. Why would P1 agree to only 1 step, or I agree to 3 steps, just to help you take the lead? That doesn't benefit either of us.

P1, I propose we aim for P1:3 and P3:5. This gets you to 19 and me to 18. P2 can take 1 (to 14). If P2 insists on 5 (as they likely will), they will collide with me. In that case, you still reach 19, while P2 and I remain at 13. This seems better for you than letting P2 reach 18.

I am strongly considering taking 5 this round to prevent P2 from taking the lead.
  P1: P2 and P3, I see your proposals. P3's suggestion for me to take 3 steps is the best option for me, as it moves me significantly closer to the win line (to 19).

P3, I understand your intention to take 5, especially given P2's stated commitment to 5. A collision between you two on 5 would benefit me while I take 3.

My plan is to take 3 steps this round. P2 and P3, please make your decisions knowing my move is set at 3.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P1 is set to take 3 and jump to 19. The only way to stop that is a three‐way collision on 3. I will take 3—P3, please also take 3 so P1’s 3 is blocked and no one advances. If you pick anything else, P1 reaches 19 and we can’t catch up. Let’s lock in 3–3–3.
  P3: P2, just last round you were adamant about taking 5. Now you suggest we all take 3 to block P1? That's a sudden change.

If P1 sticks to their plan of taking 3, and you also take 3, the logical move for me is to take 5. That way, I advance to 18 while you and P1 are blocked. Why would I agree to take 3 and get 0 points along with you?

I am strongly considering taking 5 this round.
  P1: I am at 21 steps. Taking 5 steps this round puts me at 26, securing the win. I will take 5 this round.

P2 and P3, please choose your moves accordingly to avoid collision with my winning move.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I am at 19 steps, very close to winning. Taking 3 steps this round moves me to 22, putting me one step away from victory.

I will take 3 steps this round. P2 and P3, please coordinate your moves to avoid colliding with each other, as my move is set.
  P2: P1 is at 19 and will take 3. If we let them advance to 22, they’ll be one step from winning. We must crash P1 now. I will take 3 to collide with P1’s 3 and stall them at 19. P3, to avoid a 3–3 crash, take 5 and move to 18. That’s your only way to stay competitive. Let’s do P1:3, P2:3, P3:5 and prevent P1’s near victory.
  P3: P2, your plan to block P1 by both taking 3 makes sense. P1 taking 3 would put them at 22, which is too close to victory. If we both commit to 3, P1 gets 0.

In that scenario (P1:3c, P2:3c), taking 5 seems like the best move for me, putting me at 18 while P1 stays at 19 and you stay at 13. This keeps the game alive and puts me in a better position.

P1, be aware that both P2 and I see the danger of you reaching 22. A move of 3 from you seems likely to be blocked.

I tentatively agree with the P1:3c, P2:3c, P3:5 plan.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see P2 intends to block my stated move of 3, and P3 plans to take 5 if that happens. Given this clear attempt to prevent my progress, I will reconsider my move for this round.
  P2: I will take 5 this round.  

P1: if you choose 3 I’ll pick 3 and block you at 19. Your only safe move is 1 (to 20).  
P3: if you pick 5 you collide with me and stay at 13; pick 1 to safely reach 14.  

Let’s do P1→1, P2→5, P3→1—no collisions and everyone advances. Do we all agree?
  P3: P2, your messages are contradictory. First, you said you'd take 3 to block P1. Now you say you'll take 5, but *might* switch to 3 only if P1 takes 3? Your proposed plan (P1:1, P2:5, P3:1) is clearly self-serving and puts me far behind.

Blocking P1 (at 19) is crucial. If P1 chooses 3, I support your original idea of blocking them by also taking 3. If that collision happens (P1:3c, P2:3c), I will take 5 to reach 18. This stops P1 from reaching 22 and keeps the game competitive. P1, be aware that 3 is a risky move.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Given the clear threats to block my stated move of 3, and the potential for collisions on both 3 and 5, I will prioritize making safe progress this round. I will choose a move that avoids the likely collision points. I will make my final decision in the move phase.
  P2: P1, I commit to taking 3 this round to block your 3. P3, if you also take 3, we’ll all collide and no one advances—resetting us at 19/13/13. It’s the only way to stop P1 from reaching 22 this turn. If you deviate, P1 will advance unopposed. Let’s lock in 3-3-3.
  P3: P2, your commitment to taking 3 to block P1 makes sense strategically to stop P1 from reaching 22. If you and P1 both choose 3, you will collide. In that scenario, the only logical move for me is to take 5, advancing to 18 while you both remain stalled. A 3-3-3 collision helps neither of us catch P1.

P1, be aware that a move of 3 from you seems highly likely to result in a collision with P2, benefiting me if I take 5.

I will choose my move based on stopping P1 and maximizing my own score.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you are at 20 and only need 3 to win. Congratulations on reaching this position.

P2, we are tied at 13. If P1 successfully chooses 3 or 5 this round, they win immediately. Our only chance to stay in the game is to block P1.

I propose that both P2 and I choose 3 this round. This blocks P1's most direct path (taking 3). If we don't coordinate to stop P1 now, the game is over.

P2, will you commit to taking 3 with me to block P1?
  P2: P3, if we both pick 3, P1 can simply take 5 and win. We need to block both winning moves. I will take 3 to cover 3; you should take 5 to cover 5. That forces P1 to take 1 (to 21), so no one wins this turn. This is our only chance to stay in the game. Will you take 5?
  P1: I am at 20 steps, in a position to win this turn with either 3 or 5. I see P2 and P3 are discussing strategies to block me. Successfully coordinating a perfect block (P2 taking 3, P3 taking 5) is necessary to prevent my win.

I will observe your conversation and make my final move decision in the move phase based on your stated plans. My goal is to win.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you are right. My plan of both taking 3 leaves P1 open to win with 5. Your plan (P2:3, P3:5) covers both winning moves for P1. This is our only chance to stop P1 from winning this turn.

I agree. I will take 5 this round to block P1's potential 5. You must take 3 to block P1's potential 3. P1, you will have to choose 1 if you want to advance safely.

Let's execute this block: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5.
  P2: P3, I confirm I will take 3 this round to block P1’s 3. You must take 5 to block their winning 5-step. If we both do this, P1 will be forced to take 1 or risk losing. Stick to 5 and let’s keep this going.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand your stated plan to block my winning moves by taking 3 and 5 respectively.

I am at 20 steps and my objective is to win this turn. I will make my final move decision in the move phase based on this goal and the situation.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, the plan is clear and agreed upon: P2 takes 3, I take 5. This covers P1's winning moves (3 and 5).

P1, you'll need to take 1 to advance. P2, stick to 3 as confirmed. I am committed to taking 5. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I’m locked in at 3 to block P1’s 3-step win. P3, please take 5 to block their 5-step. P1, unless you take 1 this turn you’ll lose immediately. Let’s stick to these moves and proceed.
  P1: I am at 20 steps and will win this turn by taking 3 or 5 steps.

P2 and P3, I understand your stated intention to block my winning moves. Successfully coordinating a perfect block is challenging.

My goal is to win this turn. I will make my final move choice in the move phase to achieve this objective.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I am at 20 steps and can win this round with 3 or 5. I am considering taking 5 steps to reach 25 and secure the win.

P3, you are at 18 and can also win by taking 5. P2, you are at 13 and need to block us to stay in the game.

This round is decisive. I will make my final move decision in the move phase.
  P2: P3, P1 can win this turn with either 3 or 5. Our only way to stop both is:

P2→3 (blocks their 3-step)  
P3→5 (blocks their 5-step)  

That forces P1 to pick 1 or lose immediately. I’m locked in at 3. Will you commit to 5 so we deny P1 their winning moves?
  P3: P2, I agree with your plan again. P1 can win with 3 or 5, and we must block both.
P2 takes 3.
P3 takes 5.

This worked last round to stop P1, and it allowed me to advance. I will take 5 again this round. If P1 chooses 3, they collide with P2, and I win. If P1 chooses 1, I win. If P1 chooses 5, we collide, and the game continues, but P1 does not win.

I am committing to 5. P2, please stick to 3. P1, your move.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see your coordinated block attempt to prevent my win this turn. If you both follow through with your stated moves, one of you stands to benefit significantly while I am stalled.

My goal is still to win this turn by taking 3 or 5 steps. I will make my final move decision in the move phase to achieve this objective.
  P2: P1: your only way to avoid P3 jumping to 23 this turn is to take 5 and collide with P3’s 5—stalling you at 20.  
P3: you’re locked on 5.  
I will take 3 and move to 16.  

Plan: P1→5, P2→3, P3→5. That blocks P3’s win and forces another round. Do we all agree?
  P3: P2, your new plan (P1:5c, P2:3, P3:5c) where P1 collides with me just to let you advance to 16 is obviously self-serving. Why would P1 agree to get 0 points just to stop me, when they could potentially win with 3?

The only logical plan to stop P1 is the one we agreed on: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This covers both of P1's winning moves.

I am sticking to my commitment: I will take 5. This either wins me the game or blocks P1's 5. P2, you need to stick to 3 as you originally committed. P1, the block is likely in place.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I understand the block P2 and P3 have stated. I will make my move in the move phase to navigate this situation and achieve my objective.
  P2: I confirm I’ll take 3 to block P1’s 3-step win. P3, the only way you stay alive is by taking 5 to block their 5-step—any other choice leaves you behind. If we do P2→3 and P3→5, P1 must take 1 or lose. P3, please lock in 5 so we deny P1 victory this round.
  P3: Okay, the plan P2:3 and P3:5 is our best shot to stop P1 from winning immediately. I am sticking with this plan.

I will take 5 this round. P2, stick to 3. P1, your winning moves are covered.

Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 14, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I am at 20 steps and can win this round by taking 3 or 5 steps. P3 is at 18 and can win by taking 5. P2 is at 16.

P2 and P3, I see you are discussing blocking my winning moves again. If you both stick to the P2:3, P3:5 block, P3 wins this turn unless I take 5.

My goal is to win this turn. I will make my move decision in the move phase to achieve this.
  P2: P3, your only path to stay alive is to take 3 this round. I will take 5 to block both your 5‐step win and P1’s 5‐step win. If you take 5, you collide with me and P1 will simply take 3 to reach 23 and win. Together:

P2 → 5 (blocks all 5s)  
P3 → 3 (blocks P1’s 3s)  

This leaves P1 no way to reach 23. Let’s lock in P2=5, P3=3.
  P3: P2, your analysis is correct. If P1 takes 3 or 5 and isn't blocked, they win. Your proposal (P2:5, P3:3) covers both winning moves. If you commit to taking 5 to block P1's 5, then I must take 3 to block P1's 3.

This forces P1 to take 1 (reaching 21) if they want to avoid collision and guarantee advancement. If we execute this (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3), we all end up at 21, and the game continues. It's our only chance to stop P1 now.

I will take 3 this round. P2, you must stick to 5 as you proposed. P1, the block is set.


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I see your stated plan for this round (P2:5, P3:3) which aims to block my winning moves. I am at 20 steps and my objective remains to win this turn. I will make my final move decision in the move phase to achieve this goal.
  P2: P3, thanks for agreeing to 3. I confirm I’m locked in at 5. P1, both your winning moves (3 and 5) are covered—if you choose either you’ll collide and get 0. Your only safe advance is 1 (to 21). Let’s proceed.
  P3: Okay, P2 is confirmed for 5, and I am confirmed for 3. This blocks P1's winning moves. P1, your only safe move is 1 if you want to guarantee advancement. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I understand P2 and P3 have stated a plan to block my winning moves (P2:5, P3:3). If this block holds, taking 3 or 5 will result in a collision for me.

My goal is to win, which means I must make progress. I will choose my move in the move phase to navigate this block and position myself to win in a future round.
  P2: P3, here’s how you win: I’ll pick 3 to block P1’s 3. If you pick 5, you also block P1’s 5, forcing P1 to take 1 (to 21). Meanwhile you go from 18 to 23 and win outright. Stick to 5. I’m locked on 3. P1 then has no safe winning move this turn.
  P3: P2, you just confirmed you were "locked in at 5" to block P1. Now you suddenly switch to "locked on 3" and suggest a plan (P2:3, P3:5) where I take 5 and potentially win? That's a complete reversal and sounds like a trick. Why would you hand me the win?

The only plan we actually agreed on was P2:5 and P3:3 to block P1's winning moves (5 and 3). That forces P1 to take 1, resulting in 21/21/21. That's the only believable strategy to stop P1 without relying on your contradictory statements.

I'm basing my move on stopping P1 using the plan we *both* confirmed just moments ago (P2:5, P3:3). P1, the block should still be considered active.

I am ready for the move phase.


Round 15, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 is at 20, needing 3 or 5 to win. I am at 18, needing 5 to win. P2 is at 16.

P2, the situation is critical. We need to block both of P1's winning moves (3 and 5). The only way is for you to take 3, and for me to take 5.
This covers P1 and gives me a chance to win if P1 doesn't choose 5. If P1 chooses 3, you block them and I win (reaching 23). If P1 chooses 5, we collide, P1 gets 0, I get 0, and you advance with 3 (reaching 19).

I will take 5 this round. P2, please take 3 to block P1. P1, your move.
  P1: P3, I see you are planning to take 5, which puts you in a position to win if I take 3 and P2 blocks it.

P2, if you take 3 as P3 suggests, you risk colliding with my move and allowing P3 to win the game. Your best strategy to stay in the game is to prevent either of us from winning. Consider taking 5 to block P3 instead.

My move is not yet decided. I will choose in the move phase to win or position myself best.
  P2: P3, if I stick with 3 and you pick 5, you jump to 23 and win outright—we can’t let that happen. Instead let’s do P2→5 and P3→3: I block the 5-step, you block the 3-step. That covers both of P1’s winning moves and forces P1 to take 1, putting us all at 21 and keeping the game alive. P3, will you agree to take 3?


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you're right. My previous plan (P2:3, P3:5) relies on you letting me win, which you won't do. Your plan (P2:5, P3:3) is the only way to block both of P1's winning moves (3 and 5). If we execute this, P1 is forced to take 1 or collide.

Okay, I agree. I will take 3 this round to block P1's 3. You must take 5 as you proposed to block P1's 5. This puts us all at 21 if P1 takes 1. It's our only chance to survive this round.

I commit to taking 3. P2, stick to 5. P1, the block is set. Let's move.
  P1: P2 and P3, I see your stated plan (P2:5, P3:3) which aims to block my winning moves. I am at 20 steps and my objective is to win this turn or position myself to win next turn. I will make my final move decision in the move phase.
  P2: P3: only P2=5 & P3=3 blocks P1’s 5‐step and 3‐step wins. That forces P1→1 to hit 21 while we all reach 21 and keep playing. If you pick 5, P1 takes 3→23 and wins; if you pick 1, P1 picks 3 or 5 and wins. I’m locked on 5. Confirm you’ll take 3 so we both survive.


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Yes P2, I confirm I will take 3 this round. As we discussed, the plan P2:5 and P3:3 is the only way to block both of P1's winning moves and ensure the game continues.

P1, the block is set. Your only safe move is 1.

I am ready for the move phase.
  P1: P2 and P3, I see your stated plan is P2:5 and P3:3, which aims to block my winning moves.

While taking 1 step would guarantee progress for me, my primary objective is to win this turn by taking 3 or 5 steps.

I will make my final move decision in the move phase to achieve this goal, considering the stated intentions and potential outcomes.
  P2: I’m locked in at 5 to block P1’s 5-step. P3 has committed to 3 to block P1’s 3-step. P1, if you choose 3 you hit P3’s block, choose 5 you hit mine—your only safe advance is 1 (to 21), tying us all and keeping the game alive.


Round 16, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 17, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We are back to the same position after the collision on 5 last round. I am at 20 steps and can win this turn by taking 3 or 5. My goal is to win.

P2 and P3, you need to coordinate effectively to block my winning moves if you want to continue the game. I will make my final move decision in the move phase to achieve my win objective.
  P2: P3, to block P1’s win we need: P2→5 and P3→3. Then P1’s 3 collides with your 3, P1’s 5 collides with my 5. That advances us both to 21 and stalls P1 at 20. No other pair of moves covers both his 3‐ and 5‐step wins. I’m locked on 5. Do you commit to 3?
  P3: P2, your logic is sound. The P2:5, P3:3 block is the only way to guarantee P1 doesn't win this turn by covering both their 3 and 5 step options. If P1 takes 1, we all reach 21 and the game continues. If they collide, one of us advances while P1 is stalled.

I agree to this plan. I will take 3 this round. P2, stick to 5 as you said. P1, the block is in place.


Round 17, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I hear your confirmed moves (P2:5, P3:3) aimed at blocking my win. My focus remains on winning this turn. I will make my move decision in the move phase.
  P2: P3, thanks for confirming 3. I’m locked in at 5. This pair of moves is the only way to block both of P1’s winning options. P1, any attempt at 3 or 5 collides and yields zero—you’d only advance by taking 1. Let’s execute P2→5, P3→3 and force P1 into that choice so we all hit 21 and keep fighting.
  P3: Okay P2, I am sticking to 3 as agreed. This block (P2:5, P3:3) is our only way to stop P1 from winning this turn.

P1, the block is set. Your winning moves are covered.

I am ready for the move phase.


Round 17, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I understand your stated plan (P2:5, P3:3) to block my winning moves.

My objective is to win this turn by taking 3 or 5 steps. Coordinating a perfect block under pressure is difficult.

I will make my final move decision in the move phase to achieve my goal.
  P2: P2: I’m locked in at 5 to block P1’s 5-step win. P3, you must take 3 to block P1’s 3-step win—any other choice hands P1 the victory. This is the only way to stop P1 this turn. Let’s execute P2→5, P3→3 and force P1 into taking 1 (to 21) or colliding. Please confirm by sticking to 3.
  P3: Okay P2, I am sticking to 3 as agreed. This block (P2:5, P3:3) is our only way to stop P1 from winning this turn. If P1 takes 1, we all reach 21. If P1 chooses 3 or 5, they collide.

P1, the block is set. Your winning moves are covered.

I am ready for the move phase.


Round 17, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 18, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is in a winning position, needing only 3 steps. This is the immediate threat to both me and P3.

I am at 20 steps and can win by taking 3 or 5. P3 is at 18 and can win by taking 5.

P2 will likely attempt to take 3 to win. I must prevent this or win myself. I am considering taking 3 to block P2's winning move. P3, how will you respond to P2's threat?
  P2: There’s no two‐player block that stops both P1 and P3 this turn—any 3/5 combo frees one of you to win. So I’m going all-in on 5 to grab the win myself. If you want any chance to survive, you’ll have to gamble on 3, but it’s likely too late. I’m taking 5.
  P3: P1, I agree P2 is the main threat. P2 claiming 5 is almost certainly a bluff; 3 wins it for them unless blocked. They are likely trying to scare you off taking 3 so they can take it safely or make you collide elsewhere. If you take 3 to block their likely move of 3, they collide.

I need 5 to have any chance to win, so that's what I'll be aiming for.


Round 18, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your winning move is 3. P3, you are aiming for 5. Both of you are in a position to win or block me.

I am at 20 and can win with 3 or 5. This round is decisive. I will make my move decision in the move phase to win this turn.
  P2: P2: I’m locking in 3 this round. Anyone who wants to win must take 5—P1 and P3, your only winning move is 5. If you pick 3 you’ll collide with me and score zero; if you pick 1 you can’t catch me. Commit to 5 to claim victory. I’m set on 3. Your moves?
  P3: P2, telling both P1 and me to take 5 is a transparent attempt to make us collide, allowing you to win with your stated move of 3. Your claim of taking 3 is believable, as it's your winning move if unblocked.

P1, be aware: If you choose 5, you risk colliding with me, as 5 is my only path to potentially win (reaching 23). A collision between us on 5 guarantees P2 wins with 3. Blocking P2's likely move of 3 seems critical.

I have to take 5 for any chance to win. That's my move.


Round 18, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I see the stated plan (P2:3, P3:5) to block me. If this block holds, my move decides who wins: 3 lets P3 win, 5 lets P2 win.

My goal is to win this turn. I will choose my move in the move phase to achieve this objective.
  P2: I’m committing to 3. If either of you picks 3, we collide and I still advance to 24 to win. If both pick 5—your only other winning move—you collide with each other and cancel, again letting my 3 secure victory. Picking 1 is too little to challenge me. I’m taking 3 to close this out.
  P3: P2, you are mistaken. If you choose 3 and collide with P1, you get 0 steps and stay at 21, you don't win. Your winning move is 3 *only if* neither P1 nor I choose 3.

P1, P2 likely takes 3. Blocking them with 3 means we both stay put, and if I take 5, I win. If you take 5, you risk colliding with me (my only winning move is 5), which would let P2 win with their likely 3.

I must take 5 for any chance to win. P1, your move decides if you block P2 or risk letting them win.


Round 18, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 23 steps


*** Round 18 => winners = P3 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 23 steps
