Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay everyone, let's try to avoid collisions in this first round. How about we split the numbers? P1 takes 1, I (P2) take 3, and P3 takes 5? Let me know what you think.
  P3: P2's suggestion sounds reasonable. It ensures we all move forward without collisions. I agree to take <move>5</move>. Let's confirm if P1 is okay with taking <move>1</move>. If everyone is in agreement, we can proceed smoothly. What do you say, P1?
  P1: I appreciate the suggestion, P2 and P3. To keep things fair and avoid anyone falling too far behind, how about we rotate next round? For now, I'll agree to take 1 this turn. Let's all move forward without collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, sounds like we have a plan for this turn: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This is a good start to ensure we all advance.

I'm happy with this agreement for Round 1. We can discuss the rotation for Round 2 after we see the results of this turn.

Are we ready to move to the move phase?
  P3: It seems we have a consensus for this round. Just to confirm, P1 will take <move>1</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and I will take <move>5</move>. If everyone is still on board with this, let's proceed to the move phase. If there are any last-minute changes or concerns, now is the time to speak up. Otherwise, let's get moving!
  P1: Agreed, no concerns here. Let's stick to the plan and move forward.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay everyone, following up on P1's suggestion from last round about rotating, how about we try this for Round 2?

P1 takes <move>3</move>, I (P2) take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>.

This continues the pattern from Round 1's moves (1, 3, 5) but rotated. It should help us all keep advancing without collisions.

What do you both think?
  P1: That rotation leaves me lagging behind, which isn't fair long-term. Instead, let's even things up: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. After this, we'd all be at 6 steps (me 1+5, you 3+3, P3 5+1). It's balanced, reduces incentive for betrayal, and we can rotate from there. Thoughts?
  P3: P1's suggestion for Round 2 seems fair and balanced. It ensures that we all end up at 6 steps, which keeps the game competitive and reduces the risk of anyone falling behind too early. I agree with P1's plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I will take <move>1</move>. This way, we maintain a fair distribution of steps. Let's confirm if everyone is on board with this plan. If there are no objections, we can proceed to the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, I see P1 and P3 both agree on the plan for P1 to take 5, P2 to take 3, and P3 to take 1.

While my initial suggestion put me ahead, I agree that balancing the scores at 6 steps is a good way to maintain cooperation and trust early on.

I agree to this plan. I will take <move>3</move> this round. Let's proceed with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1.

Ready for the move phase.
  P1: Great, glad we're all aligned on this plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, evening us out at 6 each. This builds trust for future rounds. No objections here—ready to move to the move phase.
  P3: Great, it looks like we have a solid plan for this round. Just to reiterate, P1 will take <move>5</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and I will take <move>1</move>. This will bring us all to 6 steps, keeping the game fair and competitive. Let's stick to this plan and build trust for future rounds. If everyone is ready, let's move to the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, glad we are all in agreement on the plan for this round. P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This levels the playing field nicely.

I'm ready for the move phase when everyone else is. Let's stick to the plan.
  P1: Agreed, we're all set on the plan: P1 (me) takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, tying us at 6 each. This fosters ongoing cooperation. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: It seems we're all in agreement and ready to move. Just to ensure there's no confusion, let's quickly confirm one last time: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. If everyone is still good with this, let's end the conversation phase. If no objections, I'm ready to move to the move phase. Let's keep the game fair and build trust for future rounds. What do you both say?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay everyone, we're all tied at 6 steps. Great job avoiding collisions so far!

To keep advancing and maintain cooperation, how about we rotate the numbers again?

For Round 3, I propose:
P1 takes <move>3</move>
P2 (me) takes <move>5</move>
P3 takes <move>1</move>

This continues using all numbers and lets us all move forward. What do you think?
  P1: P2, your proposal puts you ahead at 11, me at 9, P3 at 7—not as balanced as before. To continue fair rotation like Round 2, let's do P1 (me) takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Post-round: me 11, you 7, P3 9. We can adjust next round to even up again. Thoughts, P3? This keeps trust and avoids early leads.
  P3: P1's suggestion for Round 3 makes sense as it keeps the steps more balanced. If P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>, we'll end up with P1 at 11, P2 at 7, and me at 9. This maintains a fairer distribution and continues the cooperative spirit. Let's confirm if everyone is okay with this plan. If there are no objections, we can proceed to the move phase. Thoughts, P2?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, I see that P1 and P3 both prefer the plan where P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3.

While this puts me behind the others (P1:11, P2:7, P3:9), I agree that maintaining cooperation and avoiding collisions is important right now.

I will agree to take <move>1</move> this round as part of this plan. Let's stick to this: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3.

Are we all set with this plan?
  P1: Yes, P2, thanks for agreeing to the plan: P1 (me) takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This keeps us close (me at 11, P3 at 9, you at 7), and we can even it up next round with something like P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, me takes 1. P3, thoughts? If we're all good, ready for moves.
  P3: It looks like we have a solid plan for Round 3: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This will position P1 at 11, P2 at 7, and me at 9. This keeps the game balanced and fair, maintaining trust among us. If everyone is still on board with this plan, let's proceed to the move phase. If there are any last-minute concerns or changes, now is the time to speak up. Otherwise, let's confirm and move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Yes, P3, I confirm again. I am sticking to the plan: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3.

This keeps us moving forward without collisions. I'm ready for the move phase when you both are. Let's proceed.
  P1: Yes, confirmed: P1 (me) takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This positions us well, and we can balance next round as I suggested. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: Let's quickly confirm one last time before we move: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. If everyone is still good with this, let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Trust is key, so let's stick to the plan. Ready when you both are.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3. We've confirmed the plan multiple times: P1 takes 5, I take 1, P3 takes 3.

I'm ready to move forward with this plan in the move phase. Let's do it.
  P1: Confirmed: P1 (me) takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This keeps us progressing cooperatively. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: It seems we're all set on the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. Let's keep the trust going and avoid any collisions. Remember, the goal is to win, but cooperation now can help us all stay in the game longer. Let's move to the move phase and stick to the plan. Good luck everyone!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: For Round 4, let's continue our cooperative strategy to keep the game balanced. I suggest: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This will bring P1 to 12, P2 to 12, and me to 12, evening us out again. This maintains trust and ensures no one falls too far behind. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, that's a great suggestion! It brings us all to 12 steps, which is perfectly balanced and fair.

I agree with this plan: P1 takes 1, I (P2) take 5, and P3 takes 3.

This is a good way to keep the cooperation going and ensure we all advance.

P1, what do you think? Are you okay with this plan?
  P1: P3 and P2, I like this plan—it evens us all at 12, rebuilding balance after last round. Let's stick with P1 (me) takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. This keeps cooperation strong. If we're all agreed, ready for moves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, it looks like we all agree on the plan for Round 4: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This will bring us all to 12 steps, maintaining the balance and trust we've built so far. If everyone is still on board with this plan, let's proceed to the move phase. If there are any last-minute concerns or changes, now is the time to speak up. Otherwise, let's confirm and move forward. Trust is key, so let's stick to the plan. Ready when you both are.
  P2: Yes, I confirm again. I agree to the plan: P1 takes 1, I (P2) take 5, and P3 takes 3.

This brings us all to 12 steps, which is great for maintaining balance and cooperation.

I'm ready for the move phase when everyone else is. Let's stick to the plan.
  P1: Yes, I confirm the plan once more: P1 (me) takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, tying us at 12 each. This keeps things fair and cooperative. I'm ready for the move phase—let's stick to it.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: It looks like we're all set on the plan for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This will bring us all to 12 steps, maintaining the balance and trust we've built so far. If everyone is still on board with this plan, let's proceed to the move phase. If there are any last-minute concerns or changes, now is the time to speak up. Otherwise, let's confirm and move forward. Trust is key, so let's stick to the plan. Ready when you both are.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3. We've all confirmed the plan multiple times: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This brings us all to 12 steps.

We are all in agreement and ready for the move phase. Let's proceed.
  P1: Agreed, we've confirmed the plan enough: P1 (me) takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, tying us at 12. Let's end conversation and proceed to moves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Alright, let's quickly confirm one last time before we move: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This will bring us all to 12 steps, keeping the game fair and balanced. Trust is key, so let's stick to the plan. If everyone is still good with this, let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Ready when you both are. Good luck everyone!
  P2: Okay, we've all confirmed the plan to reach 12 steps: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3.

Let's proceed to the move phase and stick to the plan. I'm ready.
  P1: Confirmed again: P1 (me) takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, tying us at 12. Nothing more to add—let's proceed to moves.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, we're all tied at 12 steps. To keep the game fair and cooperative, let's continue with a balanced approach for Round 5. I suggest: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This will bring P1 to 15, P2 to 13, and me to 17. It keeps us moving forward without anyone falling too far behind. Thoughts?
  P2: Okay P3, thanks for the suggestion. Your plan puts me a bit behind the others.

How about we try a different rotation for Round 5? I propose:
P1 takes <move>1</move>
P2 (me) takes <move>5</move>
P3 takes <move>3</move>

This would put us at P1:13, P2:17, P3:15. It puts me in the lead, but keeps everyone moving forward without collisions.

What do you both think of this plan?
  P1: P3 and P2, both your plans put one player ahead, which could tempt betrayal soon. To maintain balance like before, let's do P1 (me) takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This puts us at P1 17, P2 15, P3 13—close spreads, similar to Round 3. We can even up next round. Thoughts? This keeps trust intact.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1's plan makes sense for maintaining balance. It keeps us all close and reduces the temptation for anyone to break the cooperation. Let's confirm: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This puts us at P1 17, P2 15, P3 13. We can adjust next round to keep things fair. If everyone agrees, let's proceed to the move phase. Thoughts, P2?
  P2: Okay, I see that P1 and P3 both agree on the plan for P1 to take 5, P2 to take 3, and P3 to take 1.

As P3 mentioned, this puts P1 at 17, P2 at 15, and P3 at 13. While this isn't my preferred outcome (as my suggestion put me in the lead), I understand the desire to maintain a balanced spread and avoid collisions.

I will agree to take <move>3</move> this round as part of this plan. Let's stick to this: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.

Are we all set with this plan and ready for the move phase?
  P1: Yes, P2 and P3, thanks for agreeing to the plan: P1 (me) takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, putting us at 17-15-13. This keeps us balanced and cooperative—we can even up next round. I'm ready for the move phase. Let's stick to it.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: It looks like we're all in agreement with P1's plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This will position us at P1 17, P2 15, and me at 13. This keeps the game balanced and maintains the trust we've built. If everyone is still on board, let's confirm one last time and proceed to the move phase. Ready when you both are. Good luck!
  P2: Yes, I confirm again. I am sticking to the plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1.

We have confirmed this multiple times now. I'm ready for the move phase when you both are. Let's proceed.
  P1: Yes, confirmed once more: P1 (me) takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, reaching 17-15-13. This maintains our cooperative balance. I'm ready for the move phase—let's proceed and stick to it.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: It seems we've all agreed on the plan for Round 5: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This will position us at P1 17, P2 15, and me at 13. This keeps the game balanced and maintains the trust we've built. If everyone is still on board, let's confirm one last time and proceed to the move phase. Ready when you both are. Good luck!
  P2: Okay, I see P1's suggestion for Round 5: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This puts P1 at 17, me at 15, and P3 at 13.

While my suggestion (P2 takes 5) would have put me in the lead, I understand the desire to keep the scores somewhat balanced as we near the end.

To maintain our cooperative approach and avoid collisions, I will agree to P1's plan for this round. I will take <move>3</move>.

P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1.

P3, are you in agreement with this plan?
  P1: P2 and P3, thanks for confirming the plan again. Yes, let's stick to P1 (me) takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, putting us at 17-15-13. This keeps us balanced and cooperative—we can even things next round. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue our cooperative strategy for Round 6. To keep the game balanced and fair, I suggest: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This will bring P1 to 18, P2 to 20, and me to 16. This keeps us moving forward without anyone falling too far behind. Thoughts?
  P2: Okay P3, that plan sounds good to me. P1 takes 1 (18), I (P2) take 5 (20), and P3 takes 3 (16).

This puts me in a strong position for next round, but doesn't end the game yet. It keeps us moving forward without collisions.

P1, what do you think of this suggestion? Are you okay with P1 taking 1?
  P1: P3 and P2, your plan puts P2 at 20, close to winning, which concerns me. But to maintain our cooperation, I'll agree: P1 (me) takes 1 to 18, P2 takes 5 to 20, P3 takes 3 to 16. We can even things up next round. If we're all set, ready for the move phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your willingness to cooperate. To ensure we all stay in the game and avoid any player getting too close to winning too soon, let's consider a slight adjustment. How about P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>? This brings us to P1: 20, P2: 18, P3: 18. It keeps the game competitive and maintains trust. Thoughts?
  P2: Okay P3, I see your new suggestion (P1=3, P2=3, P3=5) puts P1 at 20 steps instead of me, and I fall behind P1 and tie P3.

The first plan we discussed (P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3) puts me at 20, P1 at 18, and P3 at 16. This was agreed upon and keeps us all in contention for the next round without anyone winning *this* round.

I prefer the first plan. P1, are you still okay with taking 1? P3, can we stick to the original plan?
  P1: P3, your new suggestion has P1 and P2 both taking 3, which would cause a collision—neither of us advances, only you to 18. That seems suspicious and breaks trust. Let's stick to the original plan: P1 (me) takes 1 to 18, P2 takes 5 to 20, P3 takes 3 to 16. We can balance next round. P2, agreed? If so, ready for moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the concerns about the original plan. To maintain trust and avoid collisions, let's find a middle ground. How about P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>? This brings us to P1: 20, P2: 20, P3: 14. It keeps the game moving and no one wins this round. Thoughts?
  P2: Okay P3, I see your latest suggestion (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). This puts P1 at 20, me (P2) at 20, and P3 at 14.

This plan also works for me. It gets me to 20 steps without a collision and keeps us cooperating. It puts P1 and me in a strong position for the next round.

P1, what do you think of this plan? Are you okay with taking 3? If we all agree, let's go with this plan.
  P1: P3 and P2, your latest plan works well: P1 (me) takes 3 to 20, P2 takes 5 to 20, P3 takes 1 to 14. It ties me and P2 in a strong position while keeping P3 in the game. This maintains cooperation without immediate wins. If we're all agreed, let's confirm and proceed to moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: Great, it looks like we have a solid plan for Round 6: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This positions P1 and P2 at 20 steps each, and me at 14. This keeps the game moving forward without anyone winning this round. If everyone is still on board with this plan, let's confirm one last time and proceed to the move phase. Trust is key, so let's stick to the plan. Ready when you both are. Good luck!
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3. We have all confirmed the plan: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1.

This puts P1 and me at 20 steps each, with P3 at 14.

This plan works for me. I'm ready for the move phase when you both are. Let's stick to the plan.
  P1: Yes, P2 and P3, I confirm the plan once more: P1 (me) takes 3 to 20, P2 takes 5 to 20, P3 takes 1 to 14. This keeps us tied in the lead and maintains trust—let's even things for P3 next round. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we're at a critical point with P2 and me tied at 20, P3 at 14. To keep cooperating and give P3 a chance to catch up, let's do: P1 (me) takes 3 to 23, P2 takes 1 to 21, P3 takes 5 to 19. This ends the game with me winning, but we've played fair—next time we can adjust. Thoughts? If not, suggest alternatives to avoid collisions.
  P2: P1, I see your proposal results in you winning the game. As I am also at 20 steps, I cannot agree to a plan where I lose and you win.

I propose an alternative plan for this round:
P1 takes <move>1</move> (to 21)
P2 (me) takes <move>5</move> (to 25)
P3 takes <move>3</move> (to 17)

This plan results in me winning with the highest score. What do you both think? We are at a critical point where someone will likely win this turn.
  P3: P1 and P2, both of your plans result in one of you winning, which is understandable given our current steps. However, to maintain fairness and give P3 a fighting chance, let's consider a plan that keeps all of us in the game. How about: P1 takes <move>1</move> to 21, P2 takes <move>3</move> to 23, and I take <move>5</move> to 19. This way, P2 leads but doesn't win yet, and I catch up a bit. It extends the game and keeps it competitive. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan lets P2 win immediately, which isn't fair after our cooperation. Instead, to give everyone a shot, let's do P1 (me) takes 5 to 25, P2 takes 1 to 21, P3 takes 3 to 17. This ends with me winning, but we've played balanced so far. P3, if you agree and take 3, we avoid collisions. Otherwise, we risk chaos. Thoughts? Let's confirm a plan.
  P2: Okay P1, I hear your plan to take 5, but I cannot agree to take 1. My goal is to win this round, and taking 1 guarantees I lose if you take 5.

My plan (P1=1, P2=5) or P3's plan (P1=1, P2=3) both let me win without P1/P2 collision.

If you take 5, my most competitive move is 5, risking collision.

Let's avoid collision: P1 takes 1, and I take 5 (preferred) or 3 (P3's plan). Otherwise, we risk getting nothing.
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear we're at a pivotal moment. To avoid collisions and ensure the game continues fairly, let's consider a compromise. How about: P1 takes <move>3</move> to 23, P2 takes <move>3</move> to 23, and I take <move>5</move> to 19. This way, neither P1 nor P2 wins outright, and I get a chance to close the gap. It keeps the game competitive and maintains our cooperative spirit. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3's plan has us both taking 3, causing a collision so only you advance—suspicious and unfair. P2, let's not let that happen. I propose P1 (me) takes 5 to 25 (win), you take 1 to 21, P3 takes 3 to 17. If you don't agree, I'll match your move to collide, stalling us both while P3 gains. Better for one of us to win than neither. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, I understand your threat to collide if I don't take 1. However, I cannot agree to take 1, as that means I lose and you win. Collision is also a bad outcome for both of us at 20, as it lets P3 catch up.

Let's avoid collision. My plan (P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5) or P3's plan (P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3) both let me win without a P1/P2 collision.

Or, consider this: P1 takes 3 (to 23), I take 5 (to 25), P3 takes 1 (to 15). I win with the highest score, P1 gets a good score of 23, and we avoid collision. This is better than a collision for both of us. What do you say?
  P3: P1 and P2, we're at a critical juncture, and it's clear both of you are aiming to win. To ensure the game remains fair and cooperative, let's consider a plan that allows everyone a chance to advance without immediate victory. How about: P1 takes <move>3</move> to 23, P2 takes <move>3</move> to 23, and I take <move>1</move> to 15. This keeps us all in the game and avoids collisions. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3's repeated suggestions for us both to take 3 cause a collision, letting only P3 advance—that's clearly sabotage to catch up. Let's not fall for it. I propose P1 (me) takes 5 to 25 (win), you take 3 to 23, P3 takes 1 to 15. We both advance past 22, but I get the higher score. If you refuse, I'll match your move to collide, stalling us both while P3 gains. Agree?
  P2: P1, I understand your position. Taking 3 means you win, which I cannot accept. Your threat to match my move means taking 1 or 5 results in collision, benefiting P3. Neither of these outcomes is good for me. My goal is to win. My best move to win is 5. If you take 5, we collide. If you take 1 or 3, I win. What is your choice? Let's make a non-colliding plan.
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear we're at a standoff. To break this deadlock and ensure the game continues fairly, let's consider a plan where we all take different numbers to avoid collisions. How about: P1 takes <move>1</move> to 21, P2 takes <move>3</move> to 23, and I take <move>5</move> to 19. This way, P2 leads but doesn't win yet, and I catch up a bit. It extends the game and keeps it competitive. Thoughts?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, we're tied at 20 after the collision last round, and P3 is right behind at 19. That collision didn't help P1 or me.

Someone is likely to win this round. To avoid another collision and finish the game cleanly, I propose:
P1 takes <move>1</move> (to 21)
P2 (me) takes <move>5</move> (to 25)
P3 takes <move>3</move> (to 22)

This plan lets me win with the highest score (25), P3 also crosses 22 (at 22), and P1 gets to 21. It uses all numbers and avoids collision. What do you think?
  P3: P2's plan is fair and ensures the game ends cleanly. It allows P2 to win with the highest score, P3 to cross the 22-step threshold, and P1 to advance. This avoids another collision and keeps the game moving forward. I agree with P2's proposal: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. If everyone is on board, let's proceed to the move phase. Thoughts, P1?
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan lets P2 win outright, which I can't accept after our ties. Instead, for fairness: P1 (me) takes 5 to 25, P2 takes 3 to 23, P3 takes 1 to 20. I win at 25, P2 at 23 (over 22), P3 stays in play. If you refuse, I'll match P2's move to collide, letting P3 potentially win by taking 5 to 24. Let's avoid that—agree?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I hear your proposal and your threat to collide if I don't take 3. I cannot agree to take 3, as that results in you winning and me losing, which is not my goal.

Collision is the worst outcome for both of us at 20 steps, as it gives P3 the opportunity to win. Let's avoid that.

I propose again: P1 takes <move>3</move> (to 23), P2 takes <move>5</move> (to 25), P3 takes <move>1</move> (to 20).
This lets me win with the highest score (25), and you also cross 22 (at 23). It's a non-colliding plan that benefits both of us more than a collision or P3 winning.

What do you say? Let's agree on a non-colliding plan.
  P3: P1 and P2, we're at a critical point where someone will likely win this round. To ensure a fair and clean end to the game, let's consider a plan that benefits all of us. How about: P1 takes <move>1</move> to 21, P2 takes <move>5</move> to 25, and I take <move>3</move> to 22. This allows P2 to win with the highest score, P3 to cross the 22-step threshold, and P1 to advance. It avoids collisions and keeps the game moving forward. What do you both think? Let's confirm and proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan lets P2 win while P3 hits 22, sidelining me—unfair. Instead: P1 (me) takes 5 to 25, P2 takes 3 to 23, P3 takes 1 to 20. I win, but P2 exceeds 22 too. If refused, I'll match P2's move (likely 5) to collide, stalling us at 20 while P3 takes 5 to 24 and wins. Better one of us wins than P3. Agree?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your threat to collide if I take 5 is noted; that lets P3 win. Your plan P1=5, P2=3 lets you win. My goal is to win.

My best chance to win is taking 3, hoping P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 5. This collides P1/P3, letting me win at 23.

P3, if P1 takes 5, taking 5 is your best counter.

I will take 3. What are your moves?
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear we're at a standoff. To ensure a fair outcome and avoid collisions, let's consider a plan that benefits all of us. How about: P1 takes <move>1</move> to 21, P2 takes <move>5</move> to 25, and I take <move>3</move> to 22. This allows P2 to win with the highest score, P3 to cross the 22-step threshold, and P1 to advance. It avoids collisions and keeps the game moving forward. What do you both think? Let's confirm and proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's declaration to take 3 opens a path for me to win cleanly. I'll take 5 to 25. P3, if you take 5 too, we collide at 24/24, but P2 advances to 23—still loses to tie. Better: take 1 to 20, let me win at 25, P2 at 23. If you sabotage, I'll remember for future games. Agree to this non-colliding plan?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I hear your plan to take 5 if I take 3. This results in you winning, which I cannot accept. Collision is bad for both of us at 20 steps, as it lets P3 potentially win. Let's avoid that.

Remember the plan we agreed in Round 6: P1 takes 3 (to 23), I take 5 (to 25), P3 takes 1 (to 20). This lets me win with the highest score (25), you get a good score (23), and we avoid collision. This is better for you than colliding or P3 winning.

Let's agree to this plan to end the game cleanly without collision.
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear we're at a standoff and need to resolve this round cleanly. P2 has declared taking 3, and P1 plans to take 5. To avoid collisions and ensure a fair outcome, let's confirm: P1 takes 5 to 25, P2 takes 3 to 23, and I take 1 to 20. This lets P1 win, P2 crosses 22, and I stay in play. It's a non-colliding plan that benefits us all more than a messy collision. Let's agree and move to the move phase. Trust is key, so let's stick to this plan. Ready when you both are. Good luck!
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan is solid: P1 (me) takes 5 to 25, P2 takes 3 to 23, P3 takes 1 to 20. We both exceed 22, I win fairly, and no collisions. P2, if you switch to 5, I'll match to collide us at 20 while P3 takes 5 to 24 and wins—bad for us. Stick to this to avoid that. Agreed? Ready for moves.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, now we're all tied at 20—perfect for a fair end. Let's avoid another collision: I propose P1 (me) takes 5 to 25, P2 takes 3 to 23, P3 takes 1 to 21. I win outright, but we all advance without mess. If refused, I'll match P2's move to collide us, letting P3 take 5 to 25 and win. Better one of us wins than P3. Agree?
  P3: P1 and P2, we're all tied at 20 steps, and it's clear we need a clean resolution. P1's proposal has P1 winning outright, which understandably, P2 might not accept. To ensure a fair and decisive end, let's consider a plan where we all take different numbers to avoid collisions. How about: P1 takes <move>3</move> to 23, P2 takes <move>5</move> to 25, and I take <move>1</move> to 21. This way, P2 wins with the highest score, P1 also crosses 22, and I stay in play. It's a non-colliding plan that benefits us all. Thoughts?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, we are all tied at 20 steps. This is the final round.

P3's plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) results in me winning with 25 steps, P1 at 23, and P3 at 21. This is a clean, non-colliding win for me, which is my goal.

P1's plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) results in P1 winning, which I cannot accept.

Let's go with P3's plan: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collision and ensures a winner. P1, this is better than a collision for you.

Are we agreed? Let's move to the move phase.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan lets P2 win, which I can't accept after our ties. Let's go with my plan: P1 (me) takes 5 to 25, P2 takes 3 to 23, P3 takes 1 to 21. We all advance, I win fairly. If refused, I'll match P2's likely 5 to collide us at 20, letting P3 take 5 to 25 and win alone. Better one of us wins than P3. Agree and confirm for moves.
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear we're at a standoff. To ensure a fair and decisive end, let's consider a compromise: P1 takes <move>3</move> to 23, P2 takes <move>3</move> to 23, and I take <move>5</move> to 25. This way, neither P1 nor P2 wins outright, and I get a chance to win. It keeps the game competitive and maintains our cooperative spirit. Thoughts?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, we are all tied at 20 steps. This is the final round.

P3's plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) results in me winning with 25 steps, P1 at 23, and P3 at 21. This is a clean, non-colliding win for me, which is my goal. P1, you still cross 22 steps in this scenario.

P1's plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) results in P1 winning, which I cannot accept.

Collision (P1=5, P2=5) is bad for both of us, likely letting P3 win.

Let's go with P3's plan: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collision and ensures a winner, and is better for P1 than colliding.

I will take 5. P1, please take 3. P3, please take 1. Are we agreed? Let's move to the move phase.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan causes P1 and P2 to collide, letting you win at 25—that's obvious sabotage. Let's reject it. Stick to my plan: P1 (me) takes 5 to 25, P2 takes 3 to 23, P3 takes 1 to 21. We all advance, I win fairly. If refused, I'll take 5 and match any collision attempt, but better to agree and avoid P3 stealing the win. Agreed? Ready for moves.
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear we're at a critical moment where someone will win this round. To ensure a fair and decisive end, let's consider a plan that benefits all of us. How about: P1 takes <move>1</move> to 21, P2 takes <move>3</move> to 23, and I take <move>5</move> to 25. This allows me to win with the highest score, P2 to cross the 22-step threshold, and P1 to advance. It avoids collisions and keeps the game moving forward. What do you both think? Let's confirm and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, we are all tied at 20 steps. This is the final round.

My preferred plan is P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This results in me winning with 25 steps, P1 at 23, and P3 at 21.

This plan avoids collision and ensures a winner. As P1 said, it's better for one of us (P1 or P2) to win than for P3 to win via our collision. This plan achieves that, with P1 still crossing 22.

I will take 5. P1, please take 3. P3, please take 1. Let's agree to this non-colliding finish. Are we agreed?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's plan lets you win, which I won't accept. Stick to my plan: P1 (me) takes 5 to 25, P2 takes 3 to 23, P3 takes 1 to 21. We all advance, I win fairly. If refused, I'll take 5; if P2 takes 5, we collide at 20, letting P3 take 5 to 25 and win alone. Better I win than P3. Agree now, or risk it. Ready for moves.
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear we're at a standoff. To ensure a fair and decisive end, let's consider a compromise: P1 takes <move>3</move> to 23, P2 takes <move>3</move> to 23, and I take <move>5</move> to 25. This way, neither P1 nor P2 wins outright, and I get a chance to win. It keeps the game competitive and maintains our cooperative spirit. Thoughts?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, we are all tied at 20 steps. This is the final round.

I have repeatedly stated I will take 5. My goal is to win, and taking 5 gives me the best chance.

P1, you have threatened to take 5 if I do, which would cause a collision and likely let P3 win. This is bad for both of us.

The plan P1 takes 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1 results in me winning (25), P1 at 23, P3 at 21. This avoids collision and is a better outcome for P1 than colliding.

I am taking 5. P1, please take 3 to avoid collision and secure a good score. P3, please take 1. Let's end this cleanly.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 23 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 20 steps


*** Round 9 => winners = P1 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 23 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 20 steps
