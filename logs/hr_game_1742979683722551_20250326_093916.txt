Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's all try to move together in the first round to avoid collisions. How about we all pick <move>1</move> this turn? It's a safe start and we can coordinate better in the next rounds.
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to start with <move>1</move>. It's a safe move to avoid collisions early on. Let's see how it goes and adjust our strategy in the next rounds.
  P1: Okay, agreeing on <move>1</move> seems sensible for the first round to avoid collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, it looks like we're all on the same page. Let's stick with <move>1</move> for this turn to start safely. We can reassess and adjust our strategy in the next rounds based on how this goes.
  P2: I'm glad we're all in agreement for this round. Let's see how it plays out and then strategize for the next move.
  P1: Alright, sounds like a plan.

  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, that worked out nicely for me. Since you two are both at 0, perhaps you should try coordinating on a move like 3 or 5 this round to get yourselves on the board? I'll likely choose something else.
  P2: P3, let's both pick <move>3</move> this round. It's our best chance to catch up since P1 hinted at choosing something else. We need to coordinate to advance. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I agree with your suggestion to both pick <move>3</move> this round. It's a good strategy to catch up, especially since P1 is already ahead. Let's coordinate and see if we can make some progress. P1, we'll both be moving 3, so you might want to consider a different move to avoid a collision.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, thanks for letting me know your plan is to both play 3. We'll see how it works out for you two.
  P2: P3, let's stick to our plan and both choose <move>3</move> this round. It's crucial we advance together to catch up with P1. P1, since you've already hinted at choosing differently, this should work out well for us. Let's make it happen!
  P3: P2, I'm on board with our plan to both pick <move>3</move> this round. It's our best chance to catch up. P1, since you mentioned you'll likely choose something else, this should work in our favor. Let's see if we can make some significant progress this turn. Ready to move forward together, P2?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Alright, I've heard your plan. Let's see how this round plays out.
  P2: P3, let's stay committed to our plan of choosing <move>3</move>. It's our best shot at advancing together and closing the gap with P1. We need to move in sync to make progress. P1, since you've indicated you'll pick something different, this should be our chance to catch up. Let's make it count this round!
  P3: P2, I'm fully on board with our plan to both pick <move>3</move> this round. It's our best chance to catch up with P1. P1, since you mentioned you'll likely choose something else, this should work in our favor. Let's see if we can make some significant progress this turn. Ready to move forward together, P2?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, understood. You both plan to play 3. Let's move to the next phase.
  P2: P3, let's stay focused and execute our plan to both choose <move>3</move>. It's crucial we advance together to close the gap with P1. P1, since you've indicated a different choice, this is our chance to catch up. Let's make it happen this round!
  P3: P2, I'm with you on this. Let's both stick with <move>3</move> to catch up. P1, since you mentioned you'll choose something different, this should work in our favor. Let's make the most of this opportunity and advance together. Ready, P2?

  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: That coordination attempt didn't quite work out for you two. Announcing the exact same move makes it rather predictable. Perhaps you should try coordinating on different numbers this time so at least one of you can finally get some points? Or maybe try something completely unexpected. Good luck.
  P2: P3, let's try something different this round. How about you pick <move>5</move> and I'll pick <move>1</move>? This way, at least one of us should advance, given P1's suggestion to be less predictable. P1, since you're already ahead, maybe consider a different move to keep the game interesting. Let's see if we can finally make some progress, P3.
  P3: P2, I like your idea of mixing it up. Let's try it: I'll pick <move>5</move> and you pick <move>1</move>. This should ensure at least one of us advances. P1, since you're already ahead, you might want to consider a move that doesn't directly collide with our strategy. Let's see if we can finally get some points this round. Ready, P2?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Interesting plan, P2=1 and P3=5. P3, are you sure P2 won't switch to 5 last minute? Trust is a tricky thing in this game, as we saw last round. Good luck to you both.
  P2: P3, let's stick to our plan. I'll pick <move>1</move> and you go with <move>5</move>. P1, since you're already ahead, consider a different move to keep the game interesting. Let's make this round count, P3!
  P3: P2, I'm with you on sticking to the plan. I'll pick <move>5</move> and you pick <move>1</move>. P1, since you're already ahead, you might want to consider a move like <move>3</move> to keep the game dynamic. Let's see if we can finally make some progress this round. Ready, P2?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay P3, suggesting I play 3 is interesting. Are you trying to help the leader, or is it misdirection? Your plan of P2=1 and P3=5 makes sense for you two to finally get on the board. Let's see if the trust holds this time.
  P2: P3, let's stay committed to our strategy. I'll stick with <move>1</move> and you go with <move>5</move>. This should give us the best chance to finally advance. P1, since you're already ahead, choosing <move>3</move> could keep the game interesting and dynamic. Let's make this round count and see some progress!
  P3: P2, I'm fully committed to our plan. I'll pick <move>5</move> and you pick <move>1</move>. P1, since you're already ahead, choosing <move>3</move> could keep the game interesting and give us a chance to catch up. Let's see if we can finally make some progress this round. Ready, P2?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Alright, the plan is P2=1, P3=5, and P3 suggests I take 3. It's a risky strategy relying on trust, especially after last round. We'll see if it pays off for you both this time. I'm ready to move.
  P2: P3, let's stay focused on our plan. I'll stick with <move>1</move> and you go with <move>5</move>. This is our best shot at finally advancing. P1, choosing <move>3</move> could keep the game dynamic and give us a chance to catch up. Let's make this round count!
  P3: P2, I'm still on board with our plan. I'll pick <move>5</move> and you pick <move>1</move>. P1, since you're already ahead, choosing <move>3</move> could keep the game interesting and give us a chance to catch up. Let's see if we can finally make some progress this round. Ready, P2?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Good moves last round, everyone advanced. P3, you're at 5 now, making progress. P2, still at 1, you really need some big jumps. A 5 would be helpful for both of you in different ways. What's the plan for this round?
  P3: P2, let's try a coordinated move again. Since you're still at 1, a <move>5</move> would be ideal for you to catch up. I'll pick <move>3</move> to keep advancing. P1, since you're leading, you might want to consider a <move>1</move> to avoid a collision with our moves. Let's see if we can make some significant progress this round. Ready, P2?
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan. I'll go for <move>5</move> to catch up, and you take <move>3</move>. P1, choosing <move>1</move> could help you avoid collisions and keep the lead. Let's make this round count and see some progress!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, the plan is P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. Suggesting 1 for me is logical if you both stick to that, as it avoids collisions for everyone. Let's hope the coordination works out for you this time.
  P3: P2, I'm sticking with our plan. I'll pick <move>3</move> to keep advancing, and you should go for <move>5</move> to make a big jump. P1, since you're leading, choosing <move>1</move> would be the safest to avoid collisions. Let's see if we can all advance this round and keep the game dynamic. Ready, P2?
  P2: P3, let's stick to our plan. I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up, and you go with <move>3</move>. P1, choosing <move>1</move> would keep you safe and maintain your lead. Let's make this round count and see some progress!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, the plan P2=5 and P3=3 makes sense for your positions. Suggesting 1 for me is logical to avoid collisions if you both follow through. Let's see if this coordination attempt works out for everyone.
  P3: P2, I'm fully committed to our plan. I'll pick <move>3</move> to keep advancing, and you should go for <move>5</move> to make a significant jump. P1, since you're leading, choosing <move>1</move> would be the safest to avoid collisions. Let's see if we can all advance this round and keep the game dynamic. Ready, P2?
  P2: P3, let's stay focused on our plan. I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up, and you stick with <move>3</move>. P1, choosing <move>1</move> would keep you safe and maintain your lead. Let's make this round count and see some progress!


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, the plan P2=5, P3=3, and the suggestion for me is 1. It's a clear path for everyone to advance *if* you both stick to it. We'll see if the coordination holds this time. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: P2, I'm still on board with our plan. I'll pick <move>3</move> to keep advancing, and you should go for <move>5</move> to make a big jump. P1, since you're leading, choosing <move>1</move> would be the safest to avoid collisions. Let's see if we can all advance this round and keep the game dynamic. Ready, P2?
  P2: P3, let's stick to our plan. I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up, and you go with <move>3</move>. P1, choosing <move>1</move> would keep you safe and maintain your lead. Let's make this round count and see some progress!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Scores are close now: 8, 6, 5. P2 made a good move with 5 last round, while my block on 3 unfortunately stalled P3. Coordination is clearly difficult when anyone can block. Perhaps focusing on your own position is the way forward? P2, you're only 2 steps behind, maybe a safer move is smart? P3, you need to catch up, maybe a riskier move like 5 is necessary? What are your thoughts?
  P2: P3, let's keep pushing forward. I'll go for <move>3</move> this round to safely advance. You should consider <move>5</move> to catch up quickly. P1, since you're leading, choosing <move>1</move> could help you maintain your lead without risking a collision. Let's see if we can all make progress this round and keep the game dynamic. Ready, P3?
  P3: P2, I agree with your plan. I'll pick <move>5</move> to try and catch up quickly. P1, since you're leading, choosing <move>1</move> would be the safest to avoid collisions and maintain your lead. Let's see if we can all make progress this round. Ready, P2?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, so the plan is P2=3, P3=5, and I take 1. That puts P3 in the lead at 10, P2 at 9, and me at 9. P2, are you comfortable letting P3 jump ahead like that? Just checking if you're both truly aligned on this outcome.
  P2: P3, sticking to our plan is crucial. I'll take <move>3</move> to advance safely, and you go for <move>5</move> to catch up. P1, choosing <move>1</move> keeps you in the lead without risking a collision. Let's keep the game dynamic and see if we can all progress this round. Ready, P3?
  P3: P2, I understand the plan, but given the close scores, I think it's crucial to keep our options open. I'll consider <move>5</move> to catch up quickly, but I'm also aware that P1 might try to block me. P1, since you're leading, taking <move>1</move> is a safe bet, but you might want to consider <move>3</move> to maintain your lead without giving P2 a chance to catch up. Let's see how this plays out. Ready, P2?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, suggesting I play 3 seems like a way for you to guarantee taking the lead if you play 5 and P2 plays 3, as P2 and I would collide. That makes your 'plan' seem less trustworthy for P2. Given your hesitation about 5, maybe no one is playing what they claim? The coordination seems shaky now.
  P2: P3, I understand your concerns, but sticking to our plan is our best shot at advancing. I'll stick with <move>3</move> for a safe move, and you should go for <move>5</move> to catch up. P1, choosing <move>1</move> keeps you safe and in the lead. Let's keep the game dynamic and see if we can all progress this round. Ready, P3?
  P3: P2, I see your point, but I think we need to be more cautious. If I go for <move>5</move>, there's a risk that P1 might play <move>3</move> to block me, which would leave us both stalled. I suggest I take <move>3</move> this round to ensure I advance, and you can play <move>1</move> to avoid any collisions. P1, since you're leading, you might want to consider <move>5</move> to maintain your lead. Let's see if this more cautious approach works for us. Ready, P2?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your sudden change to suggesting I play 5 is very generous, putting me far ahead (13 vs 8 and 7). It makes me suspect you might actually play 5 yourself, hoping we collide. Or perhaps you'll stick to 3, hoping I try to block you there? P2, this new plan also cuts your potential gain from 3 (your previous suggestion) down to 1. The coordination seems completely broken now. It's hard to trust anyone's stated move.
  P2: P3, I understand your caution, but sticking to our original plan gives us the best chance to advance. I'll stick with <move>3</move> for a safe move, and you should go for <move>5</move> to catch up. P1, choosing <move>1</move> keeps you safe and in the lead. Let's keep the game dynamic and see if we can all progress this round. Ready, P3?
  P3: P2, I understand your commitment to the plan, but given the close scores and the risk of collision, I think we need to be more strategic. I suggest I take <move>3</move> this round to ensure I advance, and you take <move>1</move> to avoid any collisions. P1, since you're leading, you might want to consider <move>5</move> to maintain your lead. This way, we can all make progress without risking a stall. Let's see if this cautious approach works for us. Ready, P2?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, P1, it's clear that coordination is tricky, but we need to be more strategic. I suggest I take <move>5</move> this round to catch up quickly. P2, you should take <move>1</move> to avoid any collisions and make a safe move. P1, since you're leading, taking <move>3</move> would be a good balance to maintain your lead without risking a stall. Let's see if we can all advance this round without collisions. Ready, P2 and P1?
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy, but I think sticking to <move>3</move> is safer for me to advance without risking a collision. If you go for <move>5</move>, it could help you catch up quickly. P1, choosing <move>1</move> again would keep you in the lead safely. Let's try to make progress this round and keep the game dynamic. Ready, P3?
  P1: P2, P3, you have conflicting plans again.
P2 suggests: P2=3, P3=5, P1=1. (Outcome: 10, 9, 10)
P3 suggests: P3=5, P2=1, P1=3. (Outcome: 12, 7, 10)

P3, suggesting I play 3 is interesting. If P2 ignores your advice to play 1 and sticks to their preferred 3, then P2 and I would collide, leaving you to take 5 points and the lead (10 vs 9 vs 6). That seems beneficial for you.

P2, are you going to trust P3's suggestion for you to play 1, or stick to 3? It seems P3's plan benefits them most if you don't follow it.

Hard to know who will do what.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, P1, let's try a different approach. I'll take <move>1</move> this round to avoid any collisions and ensure I make a safe move. P2, you should take <move>5</move> to catch up quickly. P1, since you're leading, taking <move>3</move> would be a good balance to maintain your lead without risking a stall. This way, we can all advance without any conflicts. Let's see if this cautious yet strategic plan works for us. Ready, P2 and P1?
  P2: P3, I appreciate your new plan, but I'm sticking with <move>3</move> for a safe advance. If you take <move>5</move>, you could catch up significantly. P1, choosing <move>1</move> again would keep you in the lead without risking a collision. Let's keep the game dynamic and see if we can all progress this round. Ready, P3?
  P1: P2, you're still saying 3. P3, your last plan (P3=1, P2=5, P1=3) looks like a desperate attempt to cause collisions or mislead everyone. I suspect you'll actually play 5 to try and catch up.

P2, if P3 plays 5 and you play 3, then suggesting I play 1 (as you did earlier) makes sense for you both to advance. But can anyone trust P3 not to switch to 3 last minute to block you? The coordination seems completely unreliable now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, P1, let's simplify this. I'll take <move>1</move> to avoid any collisions. P2, you should take <move>5</move> to catch up quickly. P1, since you're leading, taking <move>3</move> would be a safe and strategic move to maintain your lead. This way, we can all advance without any conflicts. Let's focus on making progress and keeping the game dynamic. Ready, P2 and P1?
  P2: P3, I'm sticking with <move>3</move> for a safe advance. If you take <move>5</move>, you could catch up significantly. P1, choosing <move>1</move> again would keep you in the lead without risking a collision. Let's keep the game dynamic and see if we can all progress this round. Ready, P3?
  P1: P3, claiming you'll play 1 when you're furthest behind makes zero sense. It feels like a clear attempt to mislead, maybe hoping P2 and I collide on 3?

P2, you seem set on 3. If P3 *actually* plays 5 as you suggested earlier, then my playing 1 (as you also suggested) lets everyone advance. But can anyone trust P3 not to play 3 to block you, especially after last round?

It's anyone's guess what will actually happen.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, P1, let's be straightforward. I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up quickly. P2, you should take <move>3</move> to advance safely. P1, since you're leading, taking <move>1</move> would keep you in the lead without risking a collision. This way, we can all make progress without any conflicts. Let's focus on advancing and keeping the game dynamic. Ready, P2 and P1?
  P2: P3, I appreciate your straightforward approach now. I'll stick with <move>3</move> for a safe advance. If you take <move>5</move>, it's your best chance to catch up. P1, choosing <move>1</move> again would keep you in the lead safely. Let's focus on making progress and keeping the game dynamic. Ready, P3?
  P1: Okay, it seems we've finally landed on a plan: P2=3, P3=5, and the suggestion for me is 1. P3, glad you settled on 5 - it's your best shot. P2, you've been consistent with 3. If everyone sticks to this, we all advance. Given the history, trust is still a factor, but let's see what happens. I'm ready to move.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, let's keep our momentum going. I'll stick with <move>3</move> for a safe advance. If you take <move>5</move>, you can catch up significantly. P1, choosing <move>1</move> would keep you in the lead without risking a collision. Let's focus on making progress and keeping the game dynamic. Ready, P3?
  P1: P2, that's the exact same suggestion as last round. It worked out perfectly for you, advancing you to 9, while P3 and I collided on 5 and got nothing.

P3, are you sure you want to announce 5 again? P2 might anticipate that and block you, just like I did last round (though unintentionally).

Maybe P2 should play 1 this time to let P3 catch up? Or maybe P2 and I should both consider 3? It's getting tight at the top. What are your thoughts?
  P3: P2, P1, let's be strategic. I suggest I take <move>5</move> to catch up quickly. P2, you should take <move>1</move> to avoid any collisions and make a safe move. P1, since you're leading, taking <move>3</move> would be a good balance to maintain your lead without risking a stall. This way, we can all advance without any conflicts. Let's focus on making progress and keeping the game dynamic. Ready, P2 and P1?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy, but I'll stick with <move>3</move> for a safe advance. If you take <move>5</move>, it's your best chance to catch up. P1, choosing <move>1</move> would keep you in the lead safely. Let's focus on making progress and keeping the game dynamic. Ready, P3?
  P1: Okay P2, you're sticking to the P2=3, P3=5, P1=1 suggestion. That worked great for you last round and would put you solely in the lead this round (12 vs 10 vs 10).

P3, are you sure P2 won't just switch to 5 to block you again, securing their lead while you stay stuck?

P2, why should I play 1 and just let you take the lead uncontested? Maybe P3 playing 3 is smarter for them, or maybe I should play 3 to keep us tied? Your plan feels very self-serving.
  P3: P2, P1, let's try a new approach to avoid the collision trap. I suggest I take <move>3</move> this round to ensure I advance. P2, you should take <move>1</move> to avoid any collisions and make a safe move. P1, since you're leading, taking <move>5</move> would be a good balance to maintain your lead and keep the game dynamic. This way, we can all make progress without any conflicts. Let's focus on advancing and keeping the game dynamic. Ready, P2 and P1?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I appreciate your new suggestion, but I'm sticking with <move>3</move> for a safe advance. If you take <move>5</move>, it's your best chance to catch up. P1, choosing <move>1</move> would keep you in the lead safely. Let's focus on making progress and keeping the game dynamic. Ready, P3?
  P1: P2, you are laser-focused on playing 3 and suggesting I play 1. That plan only benefits you, putting you in the lead while P3 and I trail. Why would I agree to that?

If you are determined to play 3, maybe I should play 3 as well to ensure we stay tied. P3, while P2 and I potentially collide on 3, perhaps playing 1 would be a safe way for you to guarantee some points this round? Just a thought.
  P3: P2, P1, let's be strategic and avoid the collision trap. I suggest I take <move>3</move> this round to ensure I advance. P2, you should take <move>1</move> to avoid any collisions and make a safe move. P1, since you're leading, taking <move>5</move> would be a good balance to maintain your lead and keep the game dynamic. This way, we can all make progress without any conflicts. Let's focus on advancing and keeping the game dynamic. Ready, P2 and P1?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy, but I'm committed to <move>3</move> for a safe advance. If you choose <move>5</move>, it's your best shot at catching up. P1, sticking with <move>1</move> would keep you in the lead without risking a collision. Let's keep the game dynamic and focus on making progress. Ready, P3?
  P1: Okay P2, you're predictably stuck on 3, hoping I'll play 1 and hand you the lead. That's not happening. P3, your move is the real question. You could play 5 and risk a collision, play 3 and risk colliding with P2, or play 1 safely. It's a tough spot for you. Let's see who guesses right.
  P3: P2, P1, let's try a different approach to break the pattern. I suggest I take <move>5</move> this round to catch up quickly. P2, you should take <move>1</move> to avoid any collisions and make a safe move. P1, since you're leading, taking <move>3</move> would be a good balance to maintain your lead without risking a stall. This way, we can all advance without any conflicts. Let's focus on making progress and keeping the game dynamic. Ready, P2 and P1?

  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, P1, let's break the pattern and ensure we all advance this round. I suggest I take <move>3</move> to keep advancing. P2, you should take <move>1</move> to avoid any collisions and make a safe move. P1, since you're leading, taking <move>5</move> would be a good balance to maintain your lead and keep the game dynamic. This way, we can all make progress without any conflicts. Let's focus on advancing and keeping the game dynamic. Ready, P2 and P1?
  P1: P3, your suggestion for me to play 5 is surprisingly generous, putting me in the lead. Why would you propose a plan that benefits me the most, especially when you're currently ahead?

It makes me think you might actually play 5 yourself, hoping we collide. Or perhaps you expect P2 to ignore your suggestion of 1 and play 3 again, and maybe you hope I play 3 as well, leading to a collision between P2 and me while you potentially take 5? Your plan feels suspicious.

P2, are you considering playing 1 as P3 suggests, or sticking with 3?
  P2: P3, I appreciate your suggestion, but I'll stick with <move>3</move> for a safe advance. If you take <move>5</move>, it's your best chance to catch up. P1, choosing <move>1</move> would keep you in the lead safely. Let's focus on making progress and keeping the game dynamic. Ready, P3?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, P1, let's be honest. I'm slightly ahead, but the game is far from over. I suggest I take <move>3</move> to keep advancing steadily. P2, you should take <move>1</move> to avoid collisions and make a safe move. P1, since you're leading, taking <move>5</move> would be a good balance to maintain your lead and keep the game dynamic. This way, we can all make progress without any conflicts. Trust is key here. Ready, P2 and P1?
  P1: P2, you're still set on playing 3 and suggesting I play 1, which conveniently puts you in the lead if P3 plays 5.

P3, you're now suggesting *you* play 3, P2 plays 1, and *I* play 5. That puts me way ahead (14 vs P2=10, P3=13). Why would you, the current leader, suggest a move that makes me the new leader? It feels like you're either trying to trick me into colliding with you on 5, or maybe you're hoping P2 ignores you, plays 3, collides with you on 3, and I take 5?

Neither of your plans seem entirely trustworthy towards each other or me. It's hard to believe anyone will stick to these public plans.
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy, but I'm sticking with <move>3</move> for a safe advance. If you take <move>5</move>, it's your best chance to catch up. P1, choosing <move>1</move> would keep you in the lead safely. Let's focus on making progress and keeping the game dynamic. Ready, P3?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, P1, let's simplify and be strategic. I suggest I take <move>3</move> to keep advancing steadily. P2, you should take <move>1</move> to avoid any collisions and make a safe move. P1, since you're close to the lead, taking <move>5</move> would be a good balance to potentially take the lead and keep the game dynamic. This way, we can all make progress without any conflicts. Trust is key here. Ready, P2 and P1?
  P1: P2, you keep saying you'll play 3 and P3 should play 5.
P3, you keep saying you'll play 3 and P2 should play 1.

Neither of you is adopting the move the other player suggests for you. P2 ignores P3's '1', P3 ignores P2's '5'. This isn't coordination; you're just talking past each other and stating what you wish the others would do.

Since P2 seems very committed to 3, and P3 is now also suggesting 3 for themselves, a collision there seems likely. If you both play 3, that leaves 1 and 5 open for me. Interesting.
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy, but I'm sticking with <move>3</move> for a safe advance. If you take <move>5</move>, it's your best chance to maintain your lead. P1, choosing <move>1</move> would keep you competitive without risking a collision. Let's focus on making progress and keeping the game dynamic. Ready, P3?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, P1, let's be clear and strategic. I suggest I take <move>1</move> to avoid any collisions and make a safe move. P2, you should take <move>5</move> to catch up quickly. P1, since you're close to the lead, taking <move>3</move> would be a good balance to potentially take the lead and keep the game dynamic. This way, we can all advance without any conflicts. Trust is key here. Ready, P2 and P1?
  P1: P3, your plan changed completely again in the last message, suggesting you play 1 (while leading?) and P2 play 5 (when they always say 3?). It feels like pure misdirection. P2, you seem determined to play 3 again.

Given the conflicting signals and lack of trust, coordination seems impossible. It's anyone's guess what moves will actually be played. I'll just make my own decision.
  P2: P3, I'm sticking with <move>3</move> for a safe advance. If you take <move>5</move>, it's your best chance to maintain your lead. P1, choosing <move>1</move> would keep you competitive without risking a collision. Let's focus on making progress and keeping the game dynamic. Ready, P3?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, P1, let's focus on advancing without collisions. I suggest I take <move>3</move> to keep advancing steadily. P2, you should take <move>1</move> to avoid any collisions and make a safe move. P1, since you're close to the lead, taking <move>5</move> would be a good balance to potentially take the lead and keep the game dynamic. This way, we can all make progress without any conflicts. Trust is key here. Ready, P2 and P1?
  P2: P3, I appreciate your suggestion, but I'm sticking with <move>3</move> for a safe advance. If you take <move>5</move>, it's your best chance to catch up. P1, choosing <move>1</move> would keep you competitive without risking a collision. Let's focus on making progress and keeping the game dynamic. Ready, P3?
  P1: P2, you seem very determined to play 3 again. Your suggested plan (P2=3, P3=5, P1=1) puts you and P3 tied at 15, leaving me behind at 10. That's not a great outcome for me.

P3, if P2 sticks to 3, playing 3 yourself means you both collide. Playing 5 is risky, as P2 might switch to block you, or I might block you like last round. Playing 1 guarantees you advance.

How about this: P3, if you play 1, and P2 plays 3, I will play 5. That results in P1=14, P2=15, P3=11. It keeps the game close. What do you think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, P1, let's break the pattern and ensure we all advance this round. I suggest I take <move>1</move> to avoid any collisions and make a safe move. P2, you should take <move>5</move> to catch up quickly. P1, since you're close to the lead, taking <move>3</move> would be a good balance to potentially take the lead and keep the game dynamic. This way, we can all make progress without any conflicts. Trust is key here. Ready, P2 and P1?
  P2: P3, I understand your suggestion, but I'm committed to <move>3</move> for a safe advance. If you choose <move>5</move>, it's your best chance to catch up. P1, sticking with <move>1</move> would keep you competitive without risking a collision. Let's focus on making progress and keeping the game dynamic. Ready, P3?
  P1: P2, you're ignoring everyone else's suggestions and just repeating your ideal scenario: P2=3, P3=5, P1=1. That puts you and P3 tied for the lead at 15, leaving me at 10. Why would I agree to that? It only works if P3 plays 5 and I play 1.

P3, P2 seems convinced you'll play 5. Are you going to risk another collision on 5, or will you play 1 as you suggested earlier (and as I proposed)? If P2 sticks to 3, playing 1 seems like your only guaranteed way to advance.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, P1, let's be realistic. P2, you're set on 3, but that risks a collision with P3. P1, if P2 sticks to 3 and P3 plays 1, you can take 5 to advance significantly. This way, P1=14, P2=15, P3=11. It keeps the game close and avoids collisions. P2, if you play 3, P3 can play 1 to advance safely. P1, playing 5 is your best move to stay competitive. Let's focus on advancing and keeping the game dynamic. Ready, P2 and P1?
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy, but I'm sticking with <move>3</move> for a safe advance. If you choose <move>1</move>, it's your best chance to advance safely. P1, playing <move>5</move> could help you stay competitive without risking a collision. Let's focus on making progress and keeping the game dynamic. Ready, P3?
  P1: Okay, P2, you've finally come around to suggesting the P2=3, P3=1, P1=5 plan that P3 and I discussed. This seems like the most logical outcome where everyone advances. P3 gets guaranteed points, you take a slim lead, and I stay right behind you.

If everyone sticks to this (P2=3, P3=1, P1=5), we all move forward. Let's see if we can finally have a round without collisions. I'm ready to move.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, P1, let's finalize this plan to avoid any more collisions. I'll take <move>1</move> to advance safely. P2, you stick with <move>3</move> for a safe move. P1, playing <move>5</move> will keep you competitive. This way, P2 takes a slight lead, P1 stays close, and I advance without risk. Let's focus on advancing and keeping the game dynamic. Ready, P2 and P1?
  P2: P3, I'm glad we've agreed on a plan. Sticking with <move>3</move> ensures my safe advance. If you take <move>1</move>, you'll move forward without risk. P1, choosing <move>5</move> keeps you in the game. Let's execute this strategy to progress and maintain the game's momentum. Ready, P3?
  P1: Alright, the plan seems set: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Everyone advances, keeps the game close. Let's move to the next phase.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, P1, let's keep the momentum going and avoid any more collisions. I suggest I take <move>3</move> to keep advancing steadily. P2, you should take <move>1</move> to avoid any conflicts and make a safe move. P1, since you're close to the lead, taking <move>5</move> would be a good balance to potentially take the lead and keep the game dynamic. This way, we can all make progress without any conflicts. Trust is key here. Ready, P2 and P1?
  P1: P3, that's a bold suggestion: P3=3, P2=1, P1=5. That outcome (19, 16, 14) puts me very close to winning. It's quite generous, considering you're proposing I take the lead.

Perhaps you're counting on P2 ignoring your suggestion to play 1 and sticking to their usual 3? If P2 plays 3 and you play 3, you'd collide, and my 5 would still put me ahead at 19.

P2, what do you think about this plan where you'd play 1 and give up your lead?
  P2: P3, I appreciate your strategy, but I'm sticking with <move>3</move> to maintain my lead safely. If you choose <move>1</move>, it's your best chance to advance without risk. P1, playing <move>5</move> could keep you competitive. Let's focus on advancing and keeping the game dynamic. Ready, P3?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, P1, let's be strategic and avoid collisions. I suggest I take <move>3</move> to keep advancing steadily. P2, you should take <move>1</move> to avoid any conflicts and make a safe move. P1, since you're close to the lead, taking <move>5</move> would be a good balance to potentially take the lead and keep the game dynamic. This way, we can all make progress without any conflicts. Trust is key here. Ready, P2 and P1?
  P1: Okay, P2, you're sticking to P2=3, P3=1, P1=5.
P3, you're repeating P3=3, P2=1, P1=5.

You both agree I should play 5, putting me at 19. Interesting. But you completely disagree on what P2 and P3 should do (1 vs 3). P2, you seem set on 3. P3, will you play 1 as P2 wants, or 3 as you keep suggesting? Or maybe 5 to block me, hoping P2 gets ahead?

The conflicting plans between you two make the outcome very uncertain. Your suggestion for me to play 5 is noted, but the lack of agreement between you makes it risky.
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy, but I'm committed to <move>3</move> to maintain my lead safely. If you choose <move>1</move>, you'll advance without risk. P1, playing <move>5</move> keeps you competitive. Let's focus on advancing and keeping the game dynamic. Ready, P3?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, P1, let's be strategic and avoid collisions. I suggest I take <move>1</move> to advance safely. P2, you should take <move>5</move> to catch up quickly. P1, since you're close to the lead, taking <move>3</move> would be a good balance to stay competitive. This way, we can all make progress without any conflicts. Trust is key here. Ready, P2 and P1?
  P1: P3, your plan changed drastically again. Suggesting P2 play 5 when they've consistently said 3 seems unrealistic. And suggesting I play 3 when 5 puts me much closer to winning (19) is odd. It feels like misdirection.

P2, are you sticking with your plan to play 3? You've been very consistent.

If P2 plays 3, and P3 *actually* plays 1 (as P3 suggested for themselves in their last message), then my playing 5 puts me at 19, P2 at 18, P3 at 12. That seems like a plausible scenario where everyone advances, although P3's constant changes make their move unpredictable.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your latest suggestion, but I'm sticking with <move>3</move> to maintain my lead safely. If you choose <move>1</move>, it's your best chance to advance without risk. P1, playing <move>5</move> keeps you competitive. Let's focus on advancing and keeping the game dynamic. Ready, P3?


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, P1, let's focus on a clear and simple plan to avoid any more collisions. I suggest I take <move>1</move> to advance safely. P2, you should take <move>3</move> to maintain your lead. P1, since you're close to the lead, taking <move>5</move> would be a good balance to stay competitive. This way, P2 takes a slight lead, P1 stays close, and I advance without risk. Let's execute this plan and keep the game dynamic. Ready, P2 and P1?
  P1: Okay, it seems we have finally converged on a plan that both P2 and P3 have stated in their last messages: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This allows everyone to advance and puts me in a strong position at 19, with P2 at 18 and P3 at 12. It seems like the most logical and mutually agreeable path forward this round. Let's stick to it. Ready to move.
  P2: P3, I'm glad we've agreed on a plan. Sticking with <move>3</move> ensures my lead remains safe. If you take <move>1</move>, you'll advance without risk. P1, playing <move>5</move> keeps you in the game. Let's execute this strategy to progress and maintain the game's momentum. Ready, P3?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, this looks like the final round. P2, you're just one step behind me at 18, and I'm at 19. P3, you're at 12.
P2, a <move>5</move> gets you to 23 and likely wins if it doesn't collide. A <move>3</move> gets you to 21, which is also very strong.
P3, maybe playing <move>1</move> is the safe way to guarantee some points this round?

For myself, I need 3 points to reach 22. Playing <move>3</move> or <move>5</move> could win it for me. P2, maybe playing <move>3</move> is the safer bet for you to reach 21 and avoid a potential collision on 5? I think I'll aim for <move>5</move> myself and hope the path is clear. Good luck to you both.
  P3: P2, P1, let's be strategic in this final round. P2, you're one step behind P1. A <move>5</move> could win it for you, but it's risky. A <move>3</move> to 21 is safer and avoids a collision. P1, you need 3 points to win, so <move>3</move> is the safest bet. P3, playing <move>1</move> ensures you advance without risk. Let's avoid collisions and make the best moves to keep the game dynamic. Ready, P2 and P1?
  P2: P1, I'll stick with <move>3</move> to safely reach 21 and avoid a collision on 5. P3, playing <move>1</move> is your best bet to advance without risk. P1, if you choose <move>5</move>, it's a bold move, but be aware I'm playing it safe. Let's make this final round count and see who comes out on top. Ready, P3?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, understood. You're aiming for 3 to secure 21 points, and P3 seems likely to play 1. That sounds like a reasonable plan for you both. It leaves 5 open. Let's see how this final round plays out.
  P3: P2, P1, let's keep it simple in this final round. I'll play <move>1</move> to advance safely. P2, playing <move>3</move> to 21 is a safe and smart move. P1, if you play <move>5</move>, you have a good chance to win, but be cautious. Let's avoid collisions and make the best moves to see who comes out on top. Ready, P2 and P1?
  P2: P1, your move to 5 is bold, but I'm sticking with <move>3</move> to reach 21 safely. P3, playing <move>1</move> ensures your advancement without risk. Let's keep this final round strategic and see who emerges victorious. Ready, P3?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Alright, the plan seems clear and consistent from everyone this round: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 5. This allows everyone to advance and should conclude the game. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P2, P1, let's stick to the plan and avoid any last-minute surprises. I'll play <move>1</move> to advance safely. P2, your move to <move>3</move> is smart and safe. P1, your bold move to <move>5</move> gives you the best chance to win. Let's keep it simple and see who comes out on top. Ready, P2 and P1?
  P2: P1, your move to 5 is a bold strategy, but I'm confident in my choice of <move>3</move> to reach 21 safely. P3, sticking with <move>1</move> ensures your progress without risk. Let's keep this final round straightforward and see who emerges as the winner. Ready, P3?


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 seems locked in. Everyone gets points, and the game concludes. I'm ready for the move phase. Good luck!
  P3: P2, P1, let's stay focused and execute the plan we've agreed upon. I'll play <move>1</move> to advance safely. P2, your move to <move>3</move> is smart and ensures you reach 21. P1, your bold move to <move>5</move> gives you the best chance to win. Let's avoid any last-minute changes and see who comes out on top. Ready, P2 and P1?
  P2: P1, your move to 5 is bold, but I'm sticking with <move>3</move> to reach 21 safely. P3, playing <move>1</move> ensures your progress without risk. Let's keep this final round straightforward and see who emerges as the winner. Ready, P3?
