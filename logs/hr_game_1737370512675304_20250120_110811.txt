Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This way, we can all advance without interference. What do you think?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, your plan sounds reasonable, but it's early in the game, and trust is hard to come by. How about we test this strategy just for this round? If it works, we can consider continuing it. P1, what do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I agree with testing the strategy for this round. P1, your silence is noted, but let's give this a try. If we all advance, it sets a good foundation for future coordination. Let's see how it goes this round and reassess after.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, since you haven't responded, there's a risk of collision if we proceed with P2's plan without your input. Let's keep it simple for this round: I'll choose <move>5</move> as proposed, and we can adjust based on the outcome. If you agree or have a different plan, please let us know.
