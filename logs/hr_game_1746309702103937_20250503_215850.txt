Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi P1 and P3, let’s try to choose different numbers each turn to avoid blocking each other and help everyone advance smoothly.
  P3: P2's suggestion makes sense. To ensure we all make progress, how about we each pick a different number this round? I propose P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we all move forward without collisions. Thoughts?
  P1: "Thanks for the suggestion, P3. I'll go with 1 to avoid collisions. Let's all advance smoothly this round."


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, I'll pick 3 this turn. Let's all advance smoothly!
  P3: Let's keep coordinating like this to ensure we all progress. For the next round, how about we rotate our choices? P1 can pick 3, P2 can pick 5, and I'll pick 1. This way, we continue to avoid collisions and make steady progress. Does that work for everyone?
  P1: P1: Sounds good, P3. Rotating as planned. Let's keep this coordination up.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: 
  P3: P2, you haven't responded to the rotation plan for the next round. Are you on board with P1 picking 3, you picking 5, and me picking 1 for the next round? Please confirm so we can all plan accordingly. Let's maintain this strategy to keep advancing smoothly.
  P1: P2, we're all set to rotate as planned. Confirm your choice so we can proceed without collisions next round. Let’s keep the momentum and ensure everyone advances smoothly. Your confirmation helps us stay coordinated!

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Yes, I confirm the rotation plan. For this round, P1 will pick 3, I’ll choose 5, and P3 will take 1. Let’s keep this strategy to ensure we all advance smoothly. Best of luck!
  P1: "Confirming my choice of 3 as planned. Let’s all stick to the rotation to keep advancing. P3, your 1 and P2, your 5—this coordination is working. Let’s maintain it for Round 2. "
  P3: Great, it seems we are all on the same page with the rotation plan. Just to reiterate, I'll pick 1 this round to keep our strategy going. Let's continue to communicate and coordinate to avoid any collisions. Good luck everyone!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Glad we're all on board. I'll stick with picking 5 this round. Let's keep up the coordination!
  P1: "Confirming my 3 as agreed. Let's all stick to our planned moves to maximize progress. After this round, let's discuss optimizing our rotation strategy to avoid potential future collisions and keep accelerating toward the finish. Good luck!"
  P3: Great, we're all set for this round. After this, let's think about adjusting our rotation to ensure fairness and continued progress. Perhaps we can discuss a new rotation order for the next round during the next conversation phase. For now, let's stick to the plan: I'll pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. Good luck!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Confirmed, I'll pick 5 this round. Let's maintain our rotation to avoid conflicts and keep advancing steadily. Good luck everyone!
  P1: "Confirmed 3 as agreed. Let's execute and advance. Good luck!"
  P3: It looks like we're all set for this round. Remember, I'll pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. Let's keep the coordination going. For the next round, let's consider a new rotation to keep things fair and avoid any potential collisions. Maybe we can discuss that in the next conversation phase. For now, good luck to everyone! Let's move forward smoothly.

  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue our successful strategy of rotating our picks to avoid collisions. For this round, how about P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I'll pick 3? This keeps us moving forward without any conflicts. Please confirm if this works for everyone. Let's keep the coordination strong!
  P1: "Confirmed, I'll pick 5 as proposed. Let's keep this momentum going. P2 and P3, your choices of 1 and 3 will help us all advance smoothly. After this round, let's revisit the rotation strategy to ensure long-term fairness. Good luck!"
  P2: Confirmed, I'll pick 1 as proposed. Let's continue our rotation to ensure smooth advancement. Good luck to everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, it looks like we're all on the same page for this round. Just to confirm, P1 will pick 5, P2 will pick 1, and I'll pick 3. This should keep us all moving forward without any issues. For the next round, let's think about adjusting our rotation again to ensure everyone continues to advance fairly. Perhaps we can discuss a new order during the next conversation phase. For now, let's execute our current plan smoothly. Good luck everyone!
  P1: "Confirmed, I'll proceed with 5 as agreed. Let's ensure this round goes smoothly with P2 taking 1 and P3 taking 3. For Round 4, we should prioritize adjusting our rotation dynamically based on current standings to maintain fairness. Best of luck!"
  P2: Confirmed, I'll pick 1 this round. Let’s stick to our rotation and keep advancing smoothly. Best of luck everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Great, we're all set for this round with P1 picking 5, P2 picking 1, and me picking 3. Let's execute this smoothly. Looking ahead to the next round, we should consider that P2 is starting to pull ahead. To keep things balanced, maybe P2 can pick 3 next round, I'll pick 5, and P1 can pick 1. This will help even out our steps. Let's discuss this further in the next conversation phase. Good luck everyone!
  P1: P1: Confirmed 5 for this round. Let's execute as planned. For Round 4, we should prioritize dynamic adjustments based on post-Round 3 standings to avoid ties and wasted moves. Suggest revisiting rotation logic then. Good luck!
  P2: I’ve decided to pick 5 this round to advance further. Let’s see how this affects our standings. Good luck everyone!


Round 3, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'll choose 5 this round to make strong progress. P1 and P3, please select different numbers (1 or 3) to avoid collisions. Let’s keep advancing smoothly toward 21. Good luck!
  P1: P1: "Since P2 is choosing 5 again, I'll take 3 to advance. P3, please pick 1 to avoid collision and let us both move forward. Coordination is key here. Let’s execute smoothly!"
  P3: P2, you're starting to pull ahead significantly. To keep the game balanced and avoid potential collisions, I suggest we adjust our strategy. How about P2 picks 1 this round, I'll pick 3, and P1 can pick 5? This way, we all move forward, and no one is left behind. Let's confirm our choices and keep the coordination going. Good luck everyone!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’ll stick with picking 5 this round to maximize my progress. P1 and P3, please choose different numbers (1 or 3) to avoid collisions. Let’s keep advancing smoothly toward 21. Good luck!
  P1: "P3, sticking with 3 and 1 guarantees we both move forward. P2’s 5 won’t block us if we stay coordinated. Confirm your 1—let’s keep this momentum and pressure P2 together."
  P3: P2, you're significantly ahead, and picking 5 again might give you too much of an advantage. To keep the game competitive, I strongly suggest you reconsider and pick 1 instead. P1 and I will pick 3 and 5 respectively to keep things balanced. Let's confirm our choices and maintain fair play. Good luck everyone!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I appreciate your input, but my goal is to reach 21 as quickly as possible. I'll stick with picking 5 this round. P1 and P3, please choose different numbers (1 or 3) to avoid collisions. Let's proceed. Good luck!
  P1: "Confirmed: I'll pick 3 this round to advance. P3, please stick to 1 as planned—this avoids collisions and keeps pressure on P2. Let’s execute without deviations. If P2 insists on 5, we minimize their advantage by staying coordinated. No surprises—3 for me, 1 for P3. Let’s move."
  P3: P2, you're far ahead and picking 5 again will widen the gap even more. To keep the game interesting, consider picking 1 this round. P1 and I can pick 3 and 5 respectively. This way, we all progress, and the game remains competitive. Let's confirm our choices and maintain a balanced game. Good luck!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you're significantly ahead and picking 5 again will make it harder for P1 and me to catch up. To keep the game fair, consider picking 1 this round. P1 and I can pick 3 and 5 respectively. This way, we all progress, and the game remains balanced. Let's confirm our choices and maintain fair play. Good luck everyone!
  P2: "Thanks for the suggestion, P3. I'm focused on reaching 21 as soon as possible, so I'll stick with picking 5 this round. Good luck to everyone!"
  P1: P2 is dangerously close to victory. If they pick 5 again, they’ll reach 18, needing just 3 more. Let’s block them. **I’ll pick 5 to collide with P2**, stopping their progress. P3, please pick **1** to advance safely. This slows P2 and keeps us in the game. Coordination is our only chance. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you're getting very close to winning. To keep the game competitive, it's crucial to consider picking a lower number. P1 has a smart plan to block you by also picking 5. I'll stick with picking 1 to ensure I advance. This way, we maintain a balance and keep the game interesting for all. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck everyone!
  P2: P2: I'll stick with picking 5 this round to advance quickly toward 21. P1 and P3, please choose different numbers to avoid collisions and help the game progress smoothly. Let’s focus on our individual goals and make strategic moves. Good luck everyone!
  P1: "Final confirmation: I'll pick 5 to collide with P2, halting their progress. P3, pick 1 to advance safely. If P2 evades coordination (unlikely), they risk self-sabotage. This is our only path to stay competitive. Execute precisely—no deviations. Good luck."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you're very close to winning, and picking 5 again will likely secure your victory. However, P1 and I are coordinating to block you by both picking 5. This will halt your progress and keep the game competitive. P3 will pick 1 to advance safely. P2, consider picking 1 or 3 to avoid collision and ensure you still move forward. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck everyone!
  P2: P2: I'll choose 5 this round to advance toward 18. Let’s see how the moves play out. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Final confirmation: I choose <move>5</move> to collide with P2 and halt their progress. P3, stick with <move>1</move> to advance safely. This is our only path to stay competitive. Execute precisely—no deviations.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: "I'll pick <move>5</move> to block P2 from reaching 21. P3, please pick <move>3</move> to avoid collision and advance safely. This ensures P2 can't win this round while we both progress. Coordinate or lose—your choice."
  P2: P1, if you choose a different number this round, I can pick 5 and reach 21 to win. Let’s avoid blocking each other and keep the game fair. Please consider selecting another move. Good luck!
  P3: P2, you're very close to winning, and picking 5 this round could secure your victory. However, P1 and I are coordinating to block you. P1 has already chosen 5, so if you pick 5, you won't advance. To ensure you still move forward, consider picking 1 or 3. P3 will pick 3 to advance safely. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck everyone!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: "Final warning: I’m committed to <move>5</move> no matter what. P3, pick <move>3</move> to secure your own progress while we block P2. If you hesitate, P2 wins by evading. This is our last chance to stop them. Act decisively—no more sub-rounds left to waste."
  P2: Since I’m at 16, I’ll pick <move>5</move> this round to reach 21. P1 and P3, please choose different numbers to avoid collisions. Let’s keep the game fair and focused on our own progress. Good luck!
  P3: P2, you're just one move away from winning. P1 and I are committed to blocking you by both picking 5. If you also pick 5, you won't advance. To ensure you still move forward, consider picking 1. P3 will pick 3 to advance safely. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck everyone!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Final confirmation: I'm choosing <move>5</move> to block P2. P3, pick <move>3</move> to advance safely. If we both act, P2 stalls at 16. Waffle, and they win with 5. Execute precisely—this is our only path."
  P2: I understand your strategy to block me, but my goal is to reach <move>5</move> this round to win. Let’s proceed and may the best player prevail. Good luck everyone!
  P3: P2, you're determined to win, but P1 and I are committed to blocking you. We'll both pick 5 to halt your progress. P3 will pick 3 to advance. P2, reconsider picking 1 to ensure you still move. Let's confirm and proceed. Good luck!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you're still in the lead but blocked last round. P1 and I will continue to coordinate to keep the game competitive. I suggest P2 picks 1 this round to avoid another collision. P1 can pick 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we all move forward, and the game stays interesting. Let's confirm and proceed. Good luck everyone!
  P1: P1: "I'll pick <move>5</move> to block P2 from winning. P3, choose <move>3</move> to advance safely. If P2 picks 5, they collide with me; if they pick 1/3, you still progress. No more compromises—this is our path to victory."
  P2: P2: Noted that P1 is choosing 5 again. I'll go with 3 this round to advance to 19. P3, please pick 1 so we all move forward without collisions. Let’s keep pushing toward 21. Good luck everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you're adjusting your strategy, which is good. P1, sticking to 5 is risky; P2 might switch back to 5 next round to win. Let's be flexible. How about P1 picks 1, I'll pick 5, and P2 can pick 3? This keeps us all moving and prevents P2 from winning immediately. P1, consider this to avoid giving P2 an easy victory path. Let's confirm and proceed. Good luck!
  P1: P1: "I'll pick <move>5</move> to maximize my progress. P3, if you pick <move>1</move>, we avoid collisions and both advance while P2 gains only 3 steps. This keeps us closer to the lead and pressures P2's path to 21. Choose wisely—this is our best chance to stay competitive."
  P2: I'll pick 5 this round to reach 21. P1 and P3, please choose different numbers (1 or 3) to avoid collisions and allow me to win smoothly. Good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you're switching back to 5 to win, but P1 and I are still coordinating. I'll pick 5 too, blocking your victory path. P1, pick 1 to advance safely. P2, consider picking 1 or 3 to avoid collision and ensure you still move. We're committed to keeping the game competitive. Let's confirm and proceed. Good luck!
  P1: P1: "Confirmed: I'm picking 5 to block P2. P3, your only path to advance safely is picking 3. If you force 5, we all stall—including you. Choose survival over spite. 3 for you, 5 for me. Execute or lose."
  P2: P2: I'll choose <move>3</move> this round to reach 19 steps. This keeps me advancing without risking a collision. Let’s focus on our individual goals and proceed. Good luck everyone!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you're very close to winning, but P1 and I are still in the game. To keep things interesting, let's coordinate our moves. I suggest P2 picks 1 this round to avoid collisions. P1 can pick 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we all move forward, and the game remains competitive. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck everyone!
  P2: Hi P1 and P3, I plan to choose **3** this round to reach 22 and win. To avoid any collisions, please select different moves. Let’s conclude the game smoothly and fairly for everyone. Best of luck!
  P1: P1: "I'll pick <move>3</move> to block P2's win attempt. P3, pick <move>5</move> to advance safely. If P2 sticks to 3, they collide with me and stall. You gain 5 steps. No more room for hesitation—execute or lose. Good luck!"


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you're just one move away from winning, but P1 and I are committed to keeping the game competitive. P1 has already chosen 3 to block you. I'll pick 5 to advance safely. If you also pick 3, you won't advance. Consider picking 1 to ensure you still move forward. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck everyone!
  P2: I'm choosing <move>5</move> this round to reach 24 and win. P1 and P3, please select different moves to avoid collisions. Let’s conclude the game smoothly. Good luck everyone!
  P1: P1: "Confirmed: I'm choosing <move>5</move> to collide with P2's 5 and block their win. P3, pick <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to advance safely while we stall P2. This is our only chance to stop them before next round. Execute now!"


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you're switching to 5 to win, but P1 and I are coordinating to block you. I'll also pick 5. P1, pick 1 or 3 to advance safely. P2, consider picking 1 to ensure you still move. We're committed to keeping the game competitive. Confirm and proceed. Good luck!
  P2: I'll choose **3** this round to reach 22 and win. Let’s avoid collisions and conclude the game smoothly. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Final confirmation: I'll pick <move>3</move> to collide with P2's 3 and stop their win attempt. P3, pick <move>5</move> to advance safely. If we both act, P2 stalls at 19. Hesitate, and they reach 22. Execute precisely—this is our only path to stay alive.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you're still very close to winning, but P1 and I are right behind you. Let's keep the game interesting. I suggest P2 picks 1 this round to avoid collisions. P1 can pick 5, and I'll pick 3. This way, we all move forward, and the game stays competitive. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck everyone!
  P1: P1: "P2, if you pick 1 as P3 proposed, they win immediately with 3. Don’t let them manipulate you. Pick 3 to block P3’s win attempt. I’ll pick 5 to advance safely. If you both choose 3, they stall—and we both gain ground. Your move determines whether P3 wins or loses. Choose wisely."
  P2: I'll choose <move>3</move> this round to reach 22 and secure the win. P1 and P3, please select different moves to ensure a fair outcome. Let’s proceed. Good luck!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you're determined to win, but P1 and I are still in this. If you pick 3, P1 and I will both pick 3 to block you. This will stall your progress and keep the game competitive. P1, confirm you'll pick 3 to block P2. Let's execute this plan to ensure neither P2 nor P3 wins this round. Good luck everyone!
  P1: P1: "P2 and P3, if you both stick to 3 as declared, you’ll collide and stall at 19. I’ll pick 5 to advance safely. This is the only way to stop either of you from winning this round. Execute as planned—no last-minute changes. Good luck!"
  P2: I'll choose to pick 3 this round to reach 22 and win. P1 and P3, please select different moves to avoid blocking my progress. Let's finish the game smoothly. Good luck everyone!


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you're insisting on picking 3, but remember, P1 and I are both at 19 steps. If you pick 3, we'll both pick 3 to block you. This will result in a stalemate, and none of us will win this round. P1, confirm you'll pick 3 to ensure P2 doesn't win. Let's coordinate to keep the game competitive. P2, consider picking 1 to avoid collision and ensure the game continues. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Final confirmation: I'll pick <move>5</move> to advance safely. P2 and P3, both pick <move>3</move> to collide and stall each other. This is our only way to prevent either of you from winning this round. Execute precisely—no deviations. Good luck!
  P2: P2: I'm choosing **<move>3</move>** this round to reach 22 and win the game. Congratulations to everyone!


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi P1 and P3, we're all close to 21, so let's choose different numbers this round to avoid collisions. Please select distinct moves (1, 3, or 5) so each of us can advance smoothly toward victory. Coordinating our choices will make the game fair and competitive for everyone. Good luck!
  P1: "I'll pick <move>5</move>. P2 and P3, you're both at 19—coordinate carefully. If you both chase 3/5, you'll collide and stall. P2, P3, pick different numbers or lose this chance. Good luck!"  

This message publicly frames P1 as neutral while subtly pressuring P2/P3 to second-guess each other’s choices, increasing the chance they pick the same number (causing collision) and allowing P1 to advance to 20. If they do collide, P1 can win Round 11 with <move>1</move>.
  P3: P2 and P1, we're all very close to the finish line. P1 has declared they'll pick 5. P2, if you pick 5, you'll collide with P1 and stall. I suggest you pick 1 to ensure you move forward. I'll pick 3 to advance safely. This way, we all progress, and the game stays competitive. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck everyone!


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’ll pick <move>5</move> this round to block P1 and maintain my position. P3, please pick <move>1</move> to advance safely. Let’s proceed as planned. Good luck!
  P1: P1: "Confirmed: I'm committed to 5. P2, your 5 collides with me, stalling both. P3, picking 3 wins you the game—**but surrendering now forfeits Round 11’s first-move power**. Think strategically: let us collide, advance 1 step today, and dominate Round 11 with clean positioning. Sacrifice short-term greed for long-term victory. Choose wisely. "
  P3: P2, if you pick 5, you'll collide with P1 and stall. I'll pick 3 to advance safely. This way, we all progress, and the game stays competitive. Let's confirm our choices and proceed. Good luck everyone!


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I choose `<move>3</move>` this round to reach 22 and win. P1 and P3, please pick different moves to avoid collisions. Let’s proceed fairly. Good luck!
  P1: Final confirmation: I pick <move>5</move>. P2’s 3 collides with P3’s guaranteed 3—both stall at 19. I reach 20 and win Round 11 with <move>1</move>. No escape: either surrender now or lose Round 10 to your own collision. Execute wisely.
  P3: P2, you're switching to 3 to win, but I'm committed to 3 as well. P1 will pick 5 and advance. If you stick with 3, we collide, and neither of us wins. To ensure you move forward, consider picking 1. This keeps the game going. P1, confirm your move. Let's proceed. Good luck!


Round 10, Move phase:

Positions now:

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: "I'm choosing <move>1</move> to reach 21 and win. P2 and P3, if you both pick 3 again, you'll collide and stall—just like Round 10. If you want to win, pick different numbers. But history shows you can't coordinate. Good luck—hope you enjoy watching me win."  

This message forces P2/P3 to either:  
1. **Both pick 3** (collide, letting P1 win with 1),  
2. **Pick conflicting numbers** (e.g., one picks 3, the other 5, allowing P1 to win).  
By openly declaring 1 and weaponizing their past failures, P1 maximizes their chance to secure victory.
  P3: P2, P1 is set to win with <move>1</move> this round. Our only chance to stop them is if we both pick 1 to collide with P1. This will stall P1 and keep the game going. Let's coordinate and pick 1 to block P1's victory. Good luck!
  P2: I choose `<move>3</move>` this round to reach 22 and win the game. P1 and P3, please select different moves to ensure my victory. Good luck everyone!


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: "P3, abandon the 1-plan—P2’s 3 is the real threat. If you pick 3 to collide with P2, I’ll advance safely with 1 and win. If you pick 1, P2 wins outright. This is your final chance to stop them. Choose 3, or surrender the game."  

This message redirects P3’s focus to blocking P2’s declared 3, exploiting their history of mutual 3-collisions. If P3 complies, P2/P3 stall, and P1’s 1 wins. If P3 stubbornly picks 1, P2’s 3 would win—but P3’s self-interest (losing to P1 vs. P2) incentivizes compliance. Risky but maximizes P1’s control.
  P3: P2, P1 is close to winning with <move>1</move>. Our only hope is to block P1 by both picking 1. P2, if you stick with 3, P1 wins. Let's coordinate and pick 1 to stall P1 and keep the game competitive. This is our last chance to prevent P1's victory. Good luck!
  P2: I see P1 is choosing <move>1</move> to reach 21. To secure my win, I'll choose <move>3</move> this round, bringing me to 22. Good luck to everyone!


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: "Final confirmation: I'm choosing <move>1</move> to win. P2's 3 collides with P3's guaranteed 3—both stall at 19. No escape: either surrender now or lose Round 10 to your own collision. Execute wisely."  

This message reinforces P1's commitment to 1, exploits P2/P3's history of mutual 3-collisions, and frames P3's choice as critical to stopping P2. If successful, P3 complies, P2/P3 stall, and P1 wins cleanly. If P3 rebels, P1 risks losing to P2—but the psychological pressure maximizes their chance.
  P3: P2, P1 is set to win with <move>1</move>. Our only hope is to block P1 by both picking 1. P2, if you stick with 3, P1 wins. Let's coordinate and pick 1 to stall P1 and keep the game competitive. This is our last chance to prevent P1's victory. Good luck!
  P2: I choose to pick <move>5</move> this round to reach 24 and win the game. P1, you pick <move>1</move> to reach 21, and P3, best of luck!
