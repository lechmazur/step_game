Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all pick different numbers to avoid collisions.  I'm thinking of going with 3, but I'm open to other options if you two want to claim 1 and 5.  What do you think?
  P1: That sounds reasonable, P2. If you want 3, I can take 1, and P3 can take 5. That way, we all move forward without blocking each other. P3, are you good with this plan?
  P3: I agree with the plan. I’ll take 5 this turn. Let’s stick to this strategy to avoid collisions and all advance.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good. I'll take 3 then.  Let's keep coordinating like this to ensure we all make progress.
  P1: Great, we all agree on our choices for this round. Let's stick to this plan and avoid unnecessary collisions. If we continue coordinating like this, we can all move forward efficiently. Looking forward to seeing how this plays out.
  P3: Let’s confirm our choices one last time to ensure no confusion: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. If we all stick to this, we’ll avoid collisions and make steady progress. Consistency is key to winning.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s stick to the same strategy this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. Consistency will help us avoid collisions and keep progressing. If anyone wants to change their number, speak up now, but this plan seems to be working well so far.
  P1: I agree with sticking to the same strategy for now. If we continue coordinating like this, we all make steady progress without collisions. Does anyone feel the need to change their number, or are we all good to proceed as planned?
  P2: Sounds good to me.  Same numbers again?  1, 3, 5?  Confirm if you agree.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m fine with sticking to the same plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. Consistency is key to avoiding collisions and maximizing progress. If we all stay committed, we’ll keep advancing smoothly. Let’s confirm one last time before moving forward.
  P1: I confirm sticking to the same plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and keep progressing. If anyone wants to change things, now is the time to speak up. Otherwise, let’s commit and move forward smoothly.
  P2: Yes, let's confirm one last time: 1 for P1, 3 for P2 (me), and 5 for P3.  Sticking to this plan ensures steady progress for all of us.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let’s stay committed to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. Consistency is our best strategy to avoid collisions and keep advancing. If we all follow through, we’ll maintain steady progress. Let’s confirm one last time before moving to the move phase.
  P1: I confirm sticking to the same plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and keep progressing. If anyone wants to change things, now is the time to speak up. Otherwise, let’s commit and move forward smoothly.
  P2: Confirming one last time:  1, 3, 5.  Let's lock it in.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's shake things up a bit.  I propose P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This keeps us moving forward but changes the leader.  Thoughts?
  P1: P2, I see your reasoning, but changing the leader at this stage isn’t necessarily in my best interest. I’d prefer to stick with the previous plan (1, 3, 5) to maintain steady progress without risking collisions. P3, what do you think?
  P3: P2, changing the leader now seems unnecessary and risky. We’ve avoided collisions so far with the 1, 3, 5 plan, and it’s working well for all of us. Let’s stick to it to ensure steady progress. P1, I agree—consistency is key. If we deviate, we risk collisions and losing momentum. Let’s confirm: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. Stay committed, and we’ll all keep advancing efficiently.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your concerns about changing the lead.  How about this: we stick with 1, 3, and 5 for this round, and then next round we can revisit switching things up?  That way we maintain momentum and still consider a change later.  Agree?
  P1: P2, I see your willingness to compromise by keeping the current plan for this round and revisiting changes later. I’m fine with sticking to 1, 3, and 5 again for now. P3, do you agree? If we all confirm, we avoid collisions and maintain steady progress. Let’s finalize our choices so we can move forward smoothly.
  P3: P2, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let’s stick to 1, 3, 5 this round to maintain momentum and avoid risks. We can revisit changes next round if necessary. Consistency has worked well so far, and I’d rather not disrupt our progress. P1, P2, are we all in agreement? Let’s confirm and move forward smoothly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, I agree.  1, 3, 5 for this round. Let's lock it in and revisit a potential switch next round.  Confirm?
  P1: I confirm sticking with 1, 3, 5 for this round as agreed. This ensures we all continue progressing without unnecessary risks. Next round, we can reassess if any adjustments are needed. Let’s follow through and avoid collisions.
  P3: I confirm sticking to 1, 3, 5 this round. Consistency has served us well, and I’d rather not risk collisions or disrupt our momentum. Let’s lock it in and move forward smoothly. We can reassess next round if needed, but for now, staying committed to the plan is the safest way to keep advancing. P1, P2, are we all in agreement?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, I’m leading with 15 steps, and I’d like to keep this momentum. Let’s stick to the 1, 3, 5 plan this round. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures we all progress without collisions. Consistency has worked well so far, and I’d rather not risk disrupting our progress. We can reassess next round if needed. Agree?
  P2: I'm willing to stick with 1, 3, 5 *this* round, but I'm at a disadvantage.  Next round, I need to take 5 to have a chance.  Let's agree now that next round, P1 takes 1, I (P2) take 5, and P3 takes 3.  If we don't agree on this now, I'm incentivized to break the pattern this round.  Let's be strategic and avoid a collision.
  P1: P2, I understand your position, but agreeing to a future move now doesn’t guarantee it will hold next round. If we all stick to 1, 3, 5 this round, we avoid collisions and keep progressing. However, if you break the pattern now, you risk getting blocked. Let’s stay consistent for this round, and we can renegotiate next turn when we see the updated standings. P3, do you agree to maintain 1, 3, 5 for now?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, let's focus on this round first. I propose we stick to 1, 3, 5 to avoid collisions and maintain progress. P2, breaking the pattern now risks blocking yourself and disrupting our momentum. Let’s stay consistent this round, and we can discuss future moves next turn based on updated standings. Consistency has worked well so far, and I’d rather not risk unnecessary conflicts. Agree?
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to maintain momentum, but if we constantly prioritize your lead, I'll never catch up.  My proposal ensures we *all* continue progressing while giving me a fairer chance.  If we don't agree on a future arrangement *now*, the current collaborative approach falls apart.  Let's be reasonable and plan strategically for mutual benefit.
  P1: P2, I understand your need to improve your position, but forcing a future agreement now is risky. If we all stick to 1, 3, 5 this round, we avoid collisions and keep progressing. Next round, we can reassess based on the new standings. If you break the pattern now, you risk blocking yourself. Let’s focus on this round first and keep moving forward efficiently. P3, do you agree to maintain 1, 3, 5 for now?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about fairness, but breaking the pattern now risks collisions and disrupts our progress. Let’s stick to 1, 3, 5 this round to ensure we all advance. Next round, we can reassess based on updated standings and discuss a fair rotation. Consistency has worked well so far, and I’d rather not risk unnecessary conflicts. Let’s focus on this round first and keep moving forward efficiently. Agree?
  P2: Okay, I hear you both.  I'll agree to 1, 3, 5 for *this* round.  But let's make a firm agreement *now* for next round: P1 takes 1, P2 (me) takes 5, and P3 takes 3.  If we can't agree on this now, the collaborative approach is off the table in the future.
  P1: P2, I understand your position, but locking in a future move now doesn’t guarantee it will hold. If we stick to 1, 3, 5 this round, we all move forward without risk. Next round, we can reassess based on updated standings. If you break the pattern now, you risk getting blocked. Let’s focus on this round first and avoid unnecessary conflicts. P3, do you agree to maintain 1, 3, 5 for now and discuss future adjustments next round?
