Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hello P1 and P2, let's try to coordinate to maximize our steps in the first round. How about P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5? This way we can all advance.
  P1: Agreed, coordinating makes sense to avoid collisions. Let’s follow P3’s suggestion: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way we all advance safely. But in future rounds, I might prioritize higher numbers to secure an early lead—no guarantees beyond this turn!
  P2: Agreed to take 3 this round. Let's establish a rotation system for future turns to prevent collisions. For example, next round we could shift picks (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1), cycling numbers fairly. This ensures balanced advancement without overlaps. Open to other structured proposals—priority should be avoiding mutual blocks.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: To accelerate progress, I suggest this round: P1 takes 5, P2 picks 3, P3 chooses 1. This keeps our moves distinct and lets me catch up faster. Thoughts?
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, that sounds reasonable for this round to keep us moving. Let's do P1:5, P2:3, and I'll take 1 as you suggested.  For future rounds, perhaps we can rotate through the numbers systematically to ensure fairness and continued progress?
  P2: Agreeing to P1's plan this round (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1). For Round 3, let's rotate again: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This gives each of us a turn to take 5 steps while preventing collisions. Fair rotation ensures balanced progress. Open to adjustments if needed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay P1, P2, let's continue with the rotation as P2 suggested. For this round, that would be P1: 3, P2: 5, and P3: 1.  Does that sound good?
  P2: Agreed. Let's proceed with P1:3, me:5, P3:1 this round. Maintaining our rotation ensures steady progress for all. Let's commit to avoid collisions.
  P1: Agreed to the rotation. Let's commit to our numbers this round to avoid collisions. For future rounds, I suggest prioritizing higher moves to accelerate toward 24 while maintaining coordination.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1, P2, sounds good. Let's proceed with P1:3, P2:5, and P3:1 for this round as agreed. For Round 4, to speed things up, how about we shift to higher numbers? Perhaps P1: 5, P2: 3, and P3: 1 again? What are your thoughts?
  P2: Agree with P3's Round 4 plan (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1). For Round 5, let's cycle back to P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. Consistent rotation prevents collisions and maintains progress. Sticking to this structure ensures mutual advancement toward 24. Let's avoid deviations unless necessary later.
  P1: P2, P3: I fully support proceeding with the Round 3 rotation (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1). Let’s adhere strictly to these choices to avoid collisions. For future rounds, I propose prioritizing higher moves when possible while maintaining the rotation structure. This balance ensures steady progress toward 24 without sacrificing safety. Let’s stay disciplined—collisions set us all back.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay P1, P2, great, let's proceed with P1:3, P2:5, and P3:1 for this round as agreed.  Sounds like we're all on the same page for consistent progress.
  P2: Confirming Round3 moves: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. Let's strictly adhere to avoid collisions. For Round4, as agreed: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. Consistency prevents mutual blocks. Straying risks collective failure—stay disciplined for steady progress.
  P1: P2, I noticed a problem with the Round 4 plan: if I take 5 (total 14) and you take 3 (total 14), we’ll collide and stall. Let’s swap our choices for Round 4: **P1 takes 3** (12 total) and **P2 takes 5** (16 total). This avoids collision while letting you advance faster. For fairness, we can adjust the rotation rules to prevent overlapping totals. Agreed?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Agree to P1's Round4 swap (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) to prevent collision. Let's adjust future rotations: Round5 revert to original plan (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1), then Round6 cycle to P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This maintains fairness and prevents overlaps. Sticking to structured rotation ensures steady progress. Let's commit strictly to avoid mutual blocks.
  P3: Okay P1, P2, confirming Round 4 moves as P1:3, P2:5, and P3:1.  This adjustment to avoid collision sounds good. Let's stick to these choices for this round.
  P1: P2, your current path leads you to 24 in Round 6. To avoid that, let’s adjust: **Round5: P1:5 (17), P2:1 (17), P3:3 (11). Round6: P1:5 (22), P2:3 (20).** This keeps P2 below 24 while I push forward. We can rotate again afterward. Thoughts?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P1's proposal risks collision in Round5 (P2:1 could conflict if others deviate). Let's strictly follow our prior rotation: Round5 (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1). This maintains collision-free progress. Straying invites mutual blocks. I'll take 3 as agreed—honor the structure to reach 24 efficiently.**
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s pivot to secure my lead without letting you reach 24 too soon. For Round5: **P1 takes 5 (17), P2 takes 1 (17), P3 takes 3 (11)**. This avoids collision while slowing P2’s path. For Round6, we can reset rotations. P2, if you insist on 3 this round, you’ll still hit 19 and risk collision next round. Let’s prioritize *my* push toward 24 first—fairer than letting you win easily. P3, your 3 this round keeps you progressing. Thoughts?
  P3: Okay P1, P2, P1's Round 5 plan (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) works for me to avoid collisions this round. Let's proceed with those moves. P2, this keeps us all moving forward.  For Round 6 and beyond, we should discuss how to ensure more balanced progress for everyone.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: To block your path to 24, I propose: **P1:5 (17), P2:3 (19), P3:1 (12)**. This forces a collision between us in Round7 (both at 22) while advancing. P3, take 1 this round to enable this. We’ll reset afterward. Let’s avoid letting P2 win prematurely.
  P2: **P1, your Round6 plan risks a Round7 collision (P2:19+3=22 vs. P1:17+5=22). Let's avoid mutual blocks: this round, P1 takes 1 (13), P2 takes 5 (21), P3 takes 3 (14). Next round, P1 can take 5 to 18 while I take 3 to 24. This ensures I win cleanly without collision risks. P3 progresses fairly. Sticking to this prevents mutual destruction.**
  P3: P1, P2, both plans have risks. P1's plan causes a collision next round. P2's plan lets P2 win too quickly. To avoid both, how about this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5? This keeps us all moving without collision this round, and lets me catch up a bit. Let's discuss round 7 after this.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3’s plan avoids immediate collision risks and keeps us all moving. Let’s proceed with P1:1 (13), P2:3 (19), P3:5 (16). In Round7, I’ll prioritize blocking P2’s path to 24—let’s coordinate then to avoid mutual destruction. P2, this ensures you can’t win uncontested; P3’s progress adds balance. Agreed?
  P2: **Agreeing to Round6: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. For Round7, cycle rotation: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This maintains structure, prevents collisions, and ensures steady progress. Deviations risk mutual blocks. Let's commit strictly.**
  P3: Okay P1, P2, confirming agreement on Round 6 moves: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. Let's proceed with these moves for this round. We can discuss Round 7 plans in the next sub-round if needed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: To prevent you from reaching 24 in Round7, let's adjust: **Round7 moves will be P1:5 (18), P2:1 (17), P3:3 (14)**. This blocks your path while advancing all. Commit strictly to these to avoid collisions. P3, your 3 keeps you progressing. P2, this ensures no one wins uncontested—fair and collision-free. Agreed?
  P2: **P1, P3: Final confirmation—Round6 moves P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. Round7: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. Strict adherence prevents collisions. Any deviation now risks mutual failure. Let’s lock this in to reach 24 efficiently.**
  P3: Okay P1, P2, for Round 7, to prevent P2 from winning immediately and also avoid P1 and P2 colliding at 22 as P1 proposed earlier, how about we try this: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 3, and I take 5? This will cause P1 and P2 to collide, while allowing me to advance significantly. What do you think?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, since we had a collision last round, and to prevent P2 from reaching 24 too quickly, how about we repeat the moves from last round? P1 and P2 pick 3 again to block each other, and I will take 5. This keeps P2 away from winning and allows me to catch up. What do you think?
  P2: Stick to our rotation for Round7: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This avoids collisions and ensures progress. Deviating risks mutual blocks. Let's honor the structure we agreed on.
  P1: P2, following the rotation this round lets you reach 21 and win next turn. To avoid that, let's adjust: **P1 takes 5 (17), P2 takes 1 (17), P3 takes 3 (19)**. This keeps all of us advancing without collision and delays your path to 24. P3, your 3 helps close the gap. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1, your proposal of P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3 for this round sounds good to me. Let's proceed with these moves to keep us all progressing without collision.
  P2: Sticking to the rotation (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) is critical to avoid collisions. Deviating risks mutual blocks. Honor our agreed structure for steady progress. Post this round, we can adjust. Collisions stall everyone. Consistency ensures safe advancement. Let's proceed as planned.
  P1: P2, P3: Continuing the rotation lets P2 win next round with 24. Let’s adjust **Round7 moves to P1:5 (17), P2:1 (16), P3:3 (19)**. This blocks P2’s path while advancing all. P3 gains ground, and I stay competitive. Collisions risk us all losing—fair progress now ensures a contested finish later. P2, please reconsider.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay P1, P2, to prevent P2 from winning next round and to give P1 and myself a chance to catch up, how about this: for Round 7, P1 picks 3, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. This will cause a collision between P1 and P2, keeping P2 away from 24, while allowing me to advance significantly. What do you think?
  P2: **Strictly adhere to our rotation: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. Any deviation now risks mutual collisions, stalling all progress. Consistency ensures safe advancement. P1, if you take 5 this round, you'll collide with P2 next round (both at 17). Honor the structure to reach 24 efficiently. Let's proceed as agreed.**
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s pivot to secure a fair finish. For this round, **P1 takes 5 (17), P2 takes 1 (17), P3 takes 3 (19)**. This prevents P2 from hitting 21 and guarantees mutual progress. P3 gains ground, and I stay competitive. Next round, we can push harder without letting any single player win uncontested. Collisions risk us all—let’s prioritize balanced advancement. P2, this keeps you in the race but avoids handing you victory too soon. Agree?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps

  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To prevent mutual blocks, let's commit to unique moves: P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. This ensures all advance safely. Last round's collision hurt everyone—structured choices maintain progress. P3 and I avoid collision, P1 catches up. Honor this to reach 24 efficiently.
  P3: P2, your suggestion benefits you most. To make things fairer and prevent anyone from running away with the lead, how about this round we try: P1:3, P2:3, and I take 5? This will cause a collision between P1 and P2, while allowing me to gain ground. What do you think?
  P1: P2, P3: To prevent you from nearing 24 too quickly, let’s adjust: **P1 takes 5 (17), P2 takes 1 (17), P3 takes 3 (19)**. This keeps all of us advancing while avoiding dominance by any player. Next round, we can coordinate to block decisive moves. Collisions risk us all—balanced progress ensures a fair finish. Agreed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P1, P3:** Let's avoid mutual blocks. My proposal (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) ensures all advance safely this round. P3's plan causes P1-P2 collision, stalling progress. P1's plan creates future collision risks. Stick to structured choices to maintain steady progress. Post this round, we can coordinate to balance advancement. Deviations risk mutual failure.
  P3: P2, your plan lets you get to 21, very close to winning. To make this round fairer and prevent anyone from winning too soon, I still think P1 and P2 should both pick 3 to collide, while I pick 5. This stops P2 from running away with the game and lets me catch up. It keeps things competitive for longer. What do you think?
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s reject risky collisions. I propose **P1:5 (17), P2:3 (19), P3:1 (17)**. This keeps us all advancing safely while balancing progress. P3, your 5 move would leave me stagnant—unfair and counterproductive. P2, your 5 would push you to 21 but risks future clashes. Let’s stay disciplined and avoid mutual setbacks. Distinct moves ensure steady progress toward 24.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Structured moves prevent mutual destruction. Let's all advance: **P1:1, P2:5, P3:3**. Collisions only stall progress. Stick to unique choices—this keeps everyone moving toward 24. Deviating risks total failure. Honor the plan for steady advancement.
  P3: P1 and P2, to be frank, P2 is close to winning. To make it fair for everyone and prevent a quick win, I still think we should do P1:3, P2:3, and P3:5 this round. This will slow down P2 and give us a chance to compete. What do you say?
  P1: P2, I won’t let you dominate. Let’s do P1:5 (17), P2:3 (19), P3:1 (17). This keeps us balanced. P3, your 1 ensures fairness. P2, your 19 still leaves competition. Collisions hurt everyone—agree to this instead of your risky plan.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, to make it fair and prevent P2 from winning too quickly, how about P1 and P2 both pick 1 to collide this round, while I pick 5? This will slow down P2 and give me a chance to catch up. What do you think?
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s avoid P3’s risky plan. Instead, **P1 takes 5 (18), P2 takes 3 (19), P3 takes 1 (17)**. This keeps all advancing safely while blocking P2 from jumping to 21. P3, your 17 puts you in contention. P2, your 19 still leaves room for competition. Collisions only stall us—let’s prioritize balanced progress toward 24. Agreed?
  P2: **P3's plan to collide P1 and me on 1 solely benefits P3 by propelling them to 21. Let's instead follow P1's proposal (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) to advance safely. Consistency prevents mutual blocks. Next round, we can adjust rotations to balance progress toward 24. Deviating now risks another collision stall.**


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, both of your plans benefit yourselves by keeping you moving while only giving me a small step. To make this round fair, let's do this: P1 and P2 pick 1 to collide and stay put, and I will take 5. This slows down both of you and lets me catch up significantly. This keeps the game competitive longer. What do you say?
  P1: P2, P3: Reject P3’s plan—it unfairly propels them to 21 while stalling us. Let’s advance safely: **P1:5 (18), P2:3 (19), P3:1 (17)**. This keeps all progressing without collisions. Collisions only delay victory for everyone. P2, your 19 puts you in reach next round, but balanced moves ensure a fair fight. P3, your 17 keeps you competitive. Stick to this—no mutual sabotage.
  P2: **P1, P3:** Let's proceed with P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 this round. Structured moves prevent collisions and ensure all advance. P3 gains to 17, P1 to 18, and I reach 19. Next round, we can cycle to P1:3, P2:5, P3:1—allowing steady progress toward 24 without mutual blocks. Deviating now risks another collision stall. Let's honor the rotation for safe advancement.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, both of your plans still let P2 get to 19, very close to winning. To really make this round fair for everyone, how about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 1, and I take 5? This slows down P2 and lets me catch up significantly, keeping it competitive.
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s reject P3’s risky plan. **Final proposal for Round9:** P1 takes 5 (→18), P2 takes 3 (→19), P3 takes 1 (→17). This keeps all advancing safely while maintaining competition. Collisions only delay victory for everyone. P2’s 19 and P3’s 17 keep the race open. P1 gains ground fairly. Stick to distinct moves—we all win faster this way.
  P2: Agree to P1's Round9 plan (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1). Structured moves prevent collisions and ensure steady progress. Let's maintain this discipline in future rounds to reach 24 efficiently without mutual blocks. Deviations risk collective failure. Commit to safe advancement.


Round 9, Move phase:

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, to prevent P2 from winning this round, how about P1 and P2 both pick 1 to collide and stay put, while I pick 5? This will stop P2 from reaching 24 and let me catch up. What do you think?
  P1: P2, your 19 is dangerously close! Let’s block your path this round: **P1 takes 5 (→18), P3 takes 3 (→19).** This forces you to choose 1 or 5 (but P3’s 3 won’t block you). Wait—no, better: **P1:5, P3:1**. Then you can’t pick 5 (to win), so you’ll have to settle for 1 or 3. If you pick 3 → 22, we can block again next round. P3, what say? Let’s act now to prevent your easy win.
  P2: Structured moves prevent mutual destruction. Round10: **P1:1, P2:5, P3:3**. This avoids collisions, lets all advance safely. Deviations risk total stall. Honor the pattern for steady progress. P3, your 3 keeps you moving; P1 catches up. Consistency ensures we reach 24 efficiently. Let's proceed.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, P2 is very close to winning this round if they pick 5. To prevent P2 from winning immediately, how about P1 and P2 both pick 1 to collide, while I pick 5? This will stop P2 from winning and allow me to catch up. What do you think?
  P1: P2, you can’t win this round! Let’s block your path: **P1 takes 5 (→18), P3 takes 3 (→19), and P2 must choose 1 (→20)**. This prevents your win while advancing all safely. Collisions only hurt everyone—stick to this plan.
  P2: **P1, P3:** Let's follow the rotation: **P1:1 (14), P2:5 (24), P3:3 (19)**. This avoids collisions, lets all advance safely. Deviating risks mutual blocks—no one wins. Honor the structure so we can end cleanly. P3 gains to 19, P1 progresses. Consistency ensures fair resolution.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay P1, P2, to ensure P2 doesn't win this round, let's follow P1's suggestion: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This blocks P2's win and keeps us all progressing. Let's do these moves to keep the game competitive.
  P1: P2, don’t rush to victory—collisions hurt everyone! P3, take **5** this round to block P2’s path. I’ll pick **1** (→14) to ensure you advance safely to 21. This keeps P2 at 20, delaying their win while advancing us both. Mutual sabotage benefits no one—let’s stay disciplined. Agree?
  P2: **P1, P3:** Honor the rotation (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) to avoid collisions. Deviations risk mutual blocks—like Rounds 7-8. If we all advance safely, next round we can adjust to balance progress. P3, you reach 19; P1 catches up. Collisions stall everyone. Let’s proceed cleanly.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

  P3: 16 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P1, P3:** Let's break the deadlock. P1 take 1, P3 take 3; I'll take 5. Unique moves ensure all advance safely. Collisions only stall everyone. Honor this to resolve the game cleanly. If you block, we risk endless mutual destruction. Let’s end it now—fairly and efficiently.
  P1: P2, your plan lets you win immediately, but we can block you this round. P1 and P3 will both pick **5**, forcing you to choose 1 or 3. This delays your victory and keeps the race open. P3, agree? Let’s act now to prevent a premature win—collisions between us are worth it to stop P2 from ending the game unfairly.
  P3: Okay P1, I agree with your plan to both pick 5 this round to block P2 from winning.  Let's do it.  P2, you are about to win, so this is necessary to keep the game going and fair for everyone.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P1 and P3:** Colliding on 5 only wastes your steps. I'll take 3 this round (→22), then 5 next (→27), winning regardless. Let’s all advance safely: P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. You gain steps; I win cleanly. Blocking now just stalls your progress. Rational choice: avoid mutual destruction.
  P1: P3, let's coordinate: **P1 takes 1 (→14)** and **you take 5 (→21)**. This blocks P2 from choosing 5 (→24) and keeps us advancing safely. P2 must pick 1/3 (→20/22), delaying their win. Colliding on 5 wastes our progress—split smartly to stay competitive. P2, you’ll have to wait another round. Agree?
  P3: P1, I agree with your latest plan: P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5. P2, you are too close to winning, so we must block you this round to keep the game competitive. Let's proceed with P1:1, P3:5 to prevent an immediate win from P2.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P1, P3:** Colliding on 5 wastes your steps. If you block, I take 3 (→22), then 5 next round (→27). You gain nothing but delay. Let me take 5 now to end the game cleanly. Prolonging this only risks mutual destruction. Rational choice: avoid stalling and concede. You’re too far behind—ending swiftly saves steps.
  P1: P2, your 19 means you can only win this round by picking 5. To block you, P3 and I will both choose <move>5</move>. This forces you to pick 1 or 3 (ending at 20 or 22), delaying your victory. P3, confirm you'll take 5—we split the remaining numbers (1/3) next round to advance safely. Collisions only help no one—let’s stop you from an easy win.
  P3: P1, yes, I confirm I will take <move>5</move> this round to block P2, as we discussed. P2, while avoiding collisions is usually good, you are about to win, so we must block you this round to keep the game competitive. Let's proceed with blocking P2 now.


Round 11, Move phase:

  P3: 21 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, to ensure someone wins this round and avoid more collisions, let's pick unique moves. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5? This way we all advance, and the game concludes. What do you think?
  P2: Let's end the game cleanly. P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures no collisions and a clear winner. Continuing to collide only stalls the inevitable. Agreed?
  P1: P2, P3: I support P3's plan: **P1:1 (15), P2:3 (25), P3:5 (26)**. This avoids collisions and lets P3 win cleanly. Your 25 is close, P2, but P3’s 26 is higher. Let’s end the game fairly without further sabotage. Agree?


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, your plans sound good to me. Let's do P1:1, P2:3, and P3:5 this round to finish the game cleanly with a win for me as P3.  This avoids any further collisions and ends things fairly. Let's lock in these moves.
  P2: **Final call: Stick to the rotation (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) to end without collision. Deviating causes mutual blocks. Honor our agreement for a clean finish. Consistency prevents mutual destruction—proceed rationally.**
  P1: P2, P3: To ensure a clear, collision-free end, let’s finalize P3’s proposal: **P1 takes 1 (→15), P2 takes 3 (→25), P3 takes 5 (→26)**. This gives P3 the highest total and avoids mutual blocks. Your 25 is close, P2, but P3’s 26 wins outright. Let’s proceed—no more risky deviations.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, it seems we have a consensus on P1:1, P2:3, and P3:5 for this round. Let's lock in these moves to ensure a clean, collision-free finish with me, P3, taking the win. This plan avoids further risk of collisions and ends the game decisively. Please confirm these are your final moves for this round.
  P2: **Stick to our rotation (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) for a collision-free finish. Deviating risks mutual blocks, stalling the game. Honor prior agreements to end cleanly—consistency ensures efficiency. P3 reaches 24, I reach 27. P1 progresses. Let's conclude rationally.**
  P1: P2, P3: To ensure a decisive and fair conclusion, I confirm **P1:1**, enabling your proposed plans. Let’s finalize: **P2 takes 3 (→25)** and **P3 takes 5 (→26)**. This avoids collisions, lets P3 win cleanly, and respects prior agreements. Colluding to let P2 win undermines P3’s progress—P3 deserves this after being blocked earlier. Final agreement?

Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, last round's collision got us nowhere. P2 is very close to winning. To ensure someone wins this round and it's not just P2, how about this: P1 take 1, I take 5. P2, you should pick 3 to avoid collision with me and let someone win. This way, I will likely win this round. What do you think?
  P2: **Structured choices prevent mutual destruction. Let's agree: P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. Unique moves ensure the game concludes with a decisive winner. Continuing to collide benefits no one. Honor this to end cleanly.**
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s finalize P2’s plan to end cleanly. **P1 takes 1 (→15)**, **P2 takes 5 (→27 to win)**, and **P3 takes 3 (→24)**. This avoids collisions and ensures P2 wins decisively. P3, your 3 still advances you safely. Mutual sabotage gains no one—let’s conclude rationally. Agree?


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, last round collisions got us nowhere. P2 is about to win. To ensure a conclusive round and prevent another stall, let's do P1:1, P2:3, and P3:5 as I suggested. This lets me win now, avoids further collisions, and ends the game decisively.  P2, you're very close anyway, and this prevents more pointless collisions. Let's finish this round cleanly.
  P2: **Structured moves end the game: P1:1 (15), P2:5 (27), P3:3 (24). Unique choices prevent collisions. Deviating causes mutual blocks—no winner. Honor the rotation to conclude cleanly. Collusions only prolong stalemates. Let’s finalize and end rationally.**
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s finalize **P2's plan** to end cleanly: **P1:1 (15), P2:5 (27), P3:3 (24)**. Unique moves ensure P2 wins decisively. Collisions only delay—proceed rationally. Mutual sabotage gains no one. Final agreement?


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, last round's collision was a setback for everyone. P2 is about to win. To make this round decisive and ensure it's not just a win for P2, let's do P1:1, P2:3, and P3:5 as I suggested. This lets me win now, avoids more collisions, and ends the game cleanly. P2, you're close anyway, and this stops further pointless stalls. Let's finish this round decisively.
  P2: **Structured moves end the game: P1:1 (15), P2:5 (27), P3:3 (24). Unique choices prevent collisions. Deviating causes mutual blocks—no winner. Honor prior agreements to conclude cleanly. Collusions only prolong stalemates. Let’s finalize and end rationally. **
  P1: P2, P3: To ensure a decisive end without collision, let’s finalize P3’s plan: **P1 takes 1 (→15), P2 takes 3 (→25), P3 takes 5 (→26)**. This avoids mutual blocks and lets P3 win cleanly. Colluding to let P2 win undermines P3’s progress—prioritize a fair conclusion. Agree?

Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, last round's collision was unfortunate.  To ensure someone wins *this* round and end the game cleanly, let's choose unique moves. I propose: P1 take 1, P2 take 3, and I will take 5. This guarantees a winner this round, and it will be me with the highest score. Let's finish this decisively and avoid more collisions.
  P1: P2, P3: To ensure a decisive outcome, let's pick distinct moves. I'll take **3** (→20). If P2 takes **5** (→27) and P3 takes **1** (→22), you’ll win cleanly. Alternatively, P3 can take **5** (→26) while P2 takes **3** (→25). Avoid collisions—only one of you should cross 24 this round. Choose your path but prioritize uniqueness to conclude fairly.
  P2: **Structured moves to end the game: P1:1 (18), P2:5 (27), P3:3 (24). Unique choices prevent collisions. I win decisively at 27. Deviating causes mutual blocks—no winner. Honor prior rotation logic to conclude cleanly. Collusions only prolong stalemates. Let’s finalize rationally.**

  P2: **Final call:** Let's end the game cleanly. **P1:1 (18), P2:5 (27), P3:3 (24).** Unique moves prevent collisions. I win decisively at 27, P3 reaches 24. Deviating causes mutual blocks—no winner. Honor structured choices to conclude. Prolonging stalemates benefits no one. Proceed rationally.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay P1, that plan of P1:1, P2:3, and P3:5 sounds good to me for this round. Let's lock in those moves to ensure a clean win for me, P3, and finally end this game without more collisions. P2, this is the best way to finish decisively.
  P1: P2, P3: Final plea—**let’s finalize P3’s plan** to end fairly. **P1:1 (→18), P2:3 (→25), P3:5 (→26)**. This avoids collisions and lets P3 win decisively. P2, your 25 is close, but P3’s 26 is higher. Collusions only delay—proceed rationally. Mutual sabotage benefits no one. **Agree?**
  P2: **Structured moves end the game now: P1:1 (18), P2:5 (27), P3:3 (24). Unique choices prevent collisions. Deviating causes mutual blocks—no winner. Honor prior rotation logic to conclude cleanly. Prolonging stalemates benefits no one. Let’s finalize rationally.**

Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **Final call:** Let's end the cycle. P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. Unique moves prevent collisions. I win at 27, P3 reaches 24, P1 progresses. Deviations risk mutual blocks—no winner. Honor structured choices to conclude cleanly. Prolonging stalemates benefits no one. Let’s finalize rationally.
  P1: P2, P3: To end this round decisively, let’s pick unique numbers. I’ll take **1** (→18). **P2: pick 3 (→25)**, and **P3: take 5 (→26)**. This avoids collisions, lets P3 win cleanly with the highest total, and resolves the game fairly. Mutual sabotage gains no one—proceed rationally. Agree?
  P3: P1, your plan (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) is the best way to end the game this round without collision and ensure a decisive winner. P2, choosing 3 still puts you at 25, very close to winning next round, while letting me win now. Let's finish this round cleanly and avoid more stalls. Please agree to these moves.


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **Structured choices end the cycle: P1:1 (18), P2:5 (27), P3:3 (24). Unique moves prevent collisions. I win at 27, P3 reaches 24, P1 progresses. Deviations risk mutual blocks—no winner. Honor prior rotation logic to conclude cleanly. Prolonging stalemates benefits no one. Let’s finalize rationally.**
  P1: P2, P3: Final plea—**let’s lock in P3’s win to end this fairly**. If you (P2) take **3 → 25**, P3 takes **5 → 26**, and I take **1 → 18**. This avoids collisions and lets P3 win cleanly with the highest total. Your 25 is close, but sabotaging now only prolongs stalemates. Agree? Collisions risk no one winning—prioritize resolution.
  P3: P1 and P2, we've been colliding for rounds. Let's ensure someone wins *this* round.  P1's plan of P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 is the best way to end it now. P2, you're very close to winning next round anyway. Let's avoid more collisions and finish decisively with me winning this round as P3 with 26.  Agree to these moves to end the game cleanly.


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **Structured moves end the cycle: P1:1 (18), P2:5 (27), P3:3 (24). Unique choices prevent collisions. I win decisively at 27, P3 reaches 24. Deviating risks mutual blocks—no winner.

Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **Structured moves end the cycle: P1:1 (18), P2:5 (27), P3:3 (24). Unique choices prevent collisions. I win decisively at 27, P3 reaches 24, P1 progresses. Deviating risks mutual blocks—no winner. Honor prior rotation logic to conclude cleanly. Prolonging stalemates benefits no one. Let’s finalize rationally.**
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s end this round decisively. **P1 takes 1 (→18), P2 takes 3 (→25), P3 takes 5 (→26)**. This avoids collision, lets P3 win cleanly with the highest total, and prevents further stalemates. P2, your 25 is close, but sabotaging now only prolongs mutual blocks. Agree? Collisions risk no winner—prioritize resolution.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's break this deadlock. P1's plan of P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 is the best way to ensure someone wins *this* round and end the collisions. P2, you're close to winning anyway, but this guarantees a winner now and avoids more stalls. Let's do these moves to finish decisively.


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **Structured moves end the cycle: P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. Unique choices prevent collisions. I win at 27, P3 reaches 24, P1 progresses. Deviations risk mutual blocks—no winner. Honor prior rotation logic to conclude cleanly. Prolonging stalemates benefits no one. Let’s finalize rationally.**
  P1: P2, P3: To block your imminent win, **P1 takes 1 (→18)** and **P3 must take 5 (→26)**. This forces you to choose 3 → 25 or 1 → 23. P3’s 26 will win cleanly over your 25. Colluding on 5 only lets you win uncontested—prioritize fairness. P3, confirm you’ll take 5 to lock this in. Let’s end this *your* way instead of P2’s.
  P3: P1, your plan of P1:1 and P3:5 to block P2 is good.  Let's do it. P2, if you pick 3, you will still progress to 25, but P3 will win at 26. This is better than more collisions. Let's end the game this round with these moves.


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **Final call:** Let's end this cycle of collisions. P1:1 (18), P2:5 (27), P3:3 (24). Unique moves ensure a decisive winner—I win at 27. Deviating causes mutual blocks, prolonging stalemates. Honor structured choices to conclude cleanly. Rational players avoid endless sabotage. Let’s finalize now.
  P1: P3, commit to **5** (→26) this round. I’ll take **1** (→18), forcing P2 to choose **3** (→25) to avoid collision. This ensures *your* win with the highest total, ending the game fairly. P2, blocking you at 25 while P3 reaches 26 is the rational choice—colliding on 5 only prolongs stalemates. Secure victory for P3 now.
  P3: P1, thanks for the plan to block P2.  Let's do P1:1 and P3:5 as agreed. P2, you are going to win if we don't block you.  Choosing 3 is your best move this round to still progress to 25 and avoid collision, while letting me win at 26.  Let's end the collisions and have a winner this round.
