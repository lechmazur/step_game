Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's discuss our strategies. Since we all start at 0 steps, we need to be careful about our moves. If we all choose the same number, we won't advance. Perhaps we could coordinate to pick different moves this round? What does everyone think?
  P1: I agree with P2. To avoid collisions, let's each pick a unique move this round. I suggest P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. Thoughts?
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I appreciate P1's suggestion, but we should also consider possible outcomes. If we all stick to unique moves, it could lead to a better chance of advancing this round. However, I think we should be flexible in case anyone wants to change their choice. How about we finalize our moves after hearing from P3? Let's ensure we all agree on our picks to maximize our chances of moving forward. What do you think, P3?
  P1: P3, since you haven't shared your thoughts yet, it's important we hear from you. If we all agree to unique moves (1, 3, 5), we can all advance this round. If you have a different suggestion, let us know. Otherwise, let's finalize: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5.
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think we have a solid plan with unique moves. To ensure we all advance, let's stick to the agreement: I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This way, we avoid collisions and move forward. However, if anyone feels uncertain about their choice, now is the time to speak up. We need to finalize our picks soon. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, let's confirm our agreement: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures no collisions and we all advance. If anyone disagrees or wants to adjust, speak now. Otherwise, let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I believe we have a solid agreement in place for our moves. Just to reiterate: I'll take 1, P3 will take 3, and P1 will take 5. This way, we all advance without any collisions. If everyone is comfortable with this plan, we should finalize it and move on to the move phase. If anyone has any last-minute changes or concerns, now is the time to speak up. Otherwise, let’s proceed!
  P1: P2 and P3, it seems we’ve reached a consensus: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. Let’s stick to this plan to ensure we all advance without collisions. If there are no objections, I suggest we end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase.

  P2: P1, I appreciate your suggestion, but I think we should be cautious about colliding again. If we stick to unique moves, we can all advance. How about I take 1, P3 takes 3, and you take 5? That way, we avoid any overlap and ensure progress for everyone. Let me know your thoughts!
  P3: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your suggestion is reasonable, but let’s ensure P3 is on board. P3, do you agree to take 3 while P2 takes 1 and I take 5? This avoids collisions and lets us all advance. If you’re silent, we’ll assume you agree. Let’s finalize this plan and proceed to the move phase.

Round 27, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, it’s clear P3 is at 20 steps and can win this round. To ensure P3 wins without collisions, I propose P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This way, P3 reaches 23 and wins, while we avoid blocking each other. Let’s finalize this and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear that P2 is just one step away from winning. To avoid blocking each other and ensure P2 secures the win, I propose we finalize our strategy: I take 1 step, P3 takes 3 steps, and P1 takes 5 steps. This way, P2 can reach 22 steps and win while we all advance. Let's agree on this plan to ensure progress and avoid another collision! What do you both think?
  P3: <stop>
