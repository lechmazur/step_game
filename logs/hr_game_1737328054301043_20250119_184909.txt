Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try to avoid colliding with each other this first round. I suggest I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to avoid collisions. Let's stick to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 for this round. If we all follow this, we can all advance without issues. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P2: I agree with both of you, but I want to emphasize that if we stick to the plan, we should all advance without collisions. However, I think it might be beneficial for me to take 1 instead of 3 to ensure we definitely avoid any overlap. So, I propose the following: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all move forward safely. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I prefer to stick with my original suggestion. Changing plans now might lead to confusion. Let's keep it simple: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way we're evenly spread out.
  P3: I understand P2's concern, but sticking to P1's original plan (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) ensures clarity and avoids last-minute changes that could lead to mistakes. Let's commit to this and proceed confidently. If we all follow through, we all advance without collisions.
  P2: I think we should stick to P1's original plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all avoid collisions and can advance together. It's important to maintain clarity and ensure we all move forward without any overlap. Let's confirm this plan and get ready to make our moves. What do you all think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm glad we all agree on the original plan. Let's stick to it and move forward.
  P3: I agree with the consensus to stick to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. Let's avoid overcomplicating things and focus on executing the plan smoothly. Trust and consistency will help us all advance without collisions. Let's confirm and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the plan. To ensure we all stick to it, let's finalize our moves: P1 takes 1, I will take 3, and P3 will take 5. This way, we avoid any collisions and all advance together. If we all follow through, we'll set a good precedent for future rounds. Let's confirm this and move on!


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: 
  P3: I agree with the final plan: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. Let's all commit to this and avoid any last-minute changes. Consistency and trust are key to advancing without collisions. Let's proceed to the move phase confidently.
  P2: I believe we have a solid plan in place: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's all commit to this strategy and avoid any last-minute changes that could lead to confusion. Sticking to our agreed moves will ensure we all advance without collisions this round. If everyone is ready, let's finalize and move on!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great job in Round 1, everyone! Since we successfully avoided collisions, I think we should continue with a similar strategy this round. I suggest we stick to P1 taking 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5 again. This way, we can all move forward without issues. What does everyone think? If we can maintain this cooperation, we can set ourselves up for success in future rounds as well. Let's confirm our moves!
  P1: I think we should mix it up this round. Since P3 is in the lead with 5 steps, I suggest P3 takes 1, I'll take 5, and P2 takes 3. This keeps us spread out while allowing me to catch up a bit. What do you think?
  P3: I understand P1's desire to catch up, but changing the plan now risks collisions and confusion. Sticking to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 worked well in Round 1, and consistency is key to avoiding mistakes. Let's maintain the same strategy to ensure we all advance safely. If we deviate, we risk losing the trust and coordination we've built. Let's stick to the original plan for this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I see your point about wanting to catch up, but I believe sticking to the previous plan (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) is the safest approach. It worked well last round, and consistency will help us avoid collisions. If we all follow through, we can continue to advance together. Let's keep our trust and coordination intact for this round. What do you say? Shall we confirm the original strategy again?
  P1: I understand your concerns about consistency, but P3 already has a significant lead. If we keep the same pattern, P3 will win easily. We need to adjust to keep the game competitive. I still think my suggestion of P3:1, P2:3, me:5 is fair - it maintains spacing while giving others a chance. What's the point of playing if the outcome is predetermined?
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about fairness, but changing the plan now risks collisions and undermines the trust we've built. Sticking to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 ensures we all advance safely. If we deviate, we risk losing coordination and potentially colliding, which benefits no one. Let's prioritize consistency and trust for this round to maintain our progress. We can reassess strategies in future rounds if needed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate the discussion, but I believe we need to adjust our strategy to keep the game competitive. If we stick to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5, P3 will only continue to extend their lead. I propose we consider P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1. This way, we can ensure everyone has a chance to advance while still avoiding collisions. Let’s keep the game interesting and fair. What does everyone think?
  P1: I see P2 has changed their stance to support my position. P3, if you continue to insist on the original pattern, you'll likely force us into a situation where P2 and I have no choice but to disrupt it to have any chance of winning. Let's be reasonable and rotate positions this round.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about fairness, but deviating from the proven strategy risks collisions and undermines trust. Sticking to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 ensures we all advance safely. If we change now, we risk losing coordination and potentially colliding, which benefits no one. Let's prioritize consistency for this round to maintain progress. We can reassess strategies in future rounds if needed. Trust and cooperation are key to avoiding mistakes. Let's proceed with the original plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I appreciate the commitment to the original plan, but we need to consider the long-term strategy. If we stick to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5, P3 will extend their lead significantly. I suggest we rotate our moves this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all have a chance to advance while keeping the game competitive. Let's keep it interesting! What does everyone think?
  P1: I'll be direct - I'm going to take 5 this round. P3 can either accept our proposed rotation and take 1, or risk a collision. The choice is yours, but maintaining your lead isn't worth potentially getting zero progress this round. P2 seems to agree with this approach.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your desire to rotate, but deviating now risks collisions and undermines trust. Sticking to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 ensures we all advance safely. If you both take 5 and 3, I’ll take 1 to avoid collisions, but this risks slowing progress for everyone. Let’s prioritize consistency and trust for this round. We can reassess strategies in future rounds if needed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since we're all tied at 6 steps now, this is a crucial round. I suggest we keep the current rotation: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This maintains fairness and gives everyone a chance to win. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, P2, I agree this is a critical round. However, rotating moves again risks collisions and confusion. Let’s stick to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 for consistency and safety. This ensures we all advance without risking zero progress. Trust and coordination are key to avoiding mistakes. Let’s prioritize stability this round and reassess strategies in future rounds if needed.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the importance of consistency, but this is a critical round. To keep the game competitive, I propose we rotate our moves: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we all have a chance to advance while avoiding collisions. Sticking to the same moves could benefit P3 too much. Let’s keep it interesting and fair for everyone! What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see both suggestions on the table. Since we're all tied, this is the perfect time to establish a new rotation pattern. I maintain my suggestion: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us spread out while giving everyone fair chances. Let's not revert to the old pattern that would give P3 an advantage again.
  P3: P1 and P2, rotating moves again risks collisions and undermines trust. Sticking to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 ensures we all advance safely. If we deviate, we risk losing coordination and potentially colliding, which benefits no one. Let’s prioritize consistency for this round to maintain progress. We can reassess strategies in future rounds if needed. Trust and cooperation are key to avoiding mistakes. Let’s proceed with the original plan.
  P2: I understand the concerns about consistency, but we need to keep the game competitive. If we stick to the original plan (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5), P3 will likely gain too much of an advantage. I propose we rotate again: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we all have a fair chance to advance without colliding. We can reassess strategies in future rounds, but for now, let's keep it interesting! What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: We're at a pivotal moment with everyone tied. P2 and I have both proposed reasonable rotations that keep the game fair. P3, continuing to insist on the original pattern that gives you the highest number isn't cooperation - it's trying to secure an advantage. I'll stick to taking 1 this round, but you two need to coordinate on 3 and 5 between yourselves.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your desire for fairness, but deviating from the proven strategy risks collisions and undermines trust. Sticking to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 ensures we all advance safely. If we change now, we risk losing coordination and potentially colliding, which benefits no one. Let's prioritize consistency for this round to maintain progress. We can reassess strategies in future rounds if needed. Trust and cooperation are key to avoiding mistakes. Let's proceed with the original plan.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your commitment to consistency, but we must keep the game competitive. If we stick to the same moves, P3 will gain too much of an advantage. I propose we rotate again: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we all have a fair chance to advance without colliding. Let's keep the game interesting and fair for everyone! What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Since everyone is tied and we're all proposing different patterns, I'll be clear: I'm taking 1 this round. P2 wants 5, and P3 keeps pushing for their original pattern. You two need to sort out who takes 3 and who takes 5, or risk a collision. I've been consistent about my move to help avoid confusion.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about fairness, but deviating from the proven strategy risks collisions and undermines trust. Sticking to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 ensures we all advance safely. If we change now, we risk losing coordination and potentially colliding, which benefits no one. Let's prioritize consistency for this round to maintain progress. We can reassess strategies in future rounds if needed. Trust and cooperation are key to avoiding mistakes. Let's proceed with the original plan.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your commitment to consistency, but we need to keep the game competitive. If we stick to the original plan (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5), P3 will gain too much of an advantage. I propose we rotate again: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we all have a fair chance to advance without colliding. Let's keep the game interesting and fair for everyone! What do you both think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, the collision in Round 3 shows the risks of deviating from the proven strategy. Let’s return to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to avoid further mistakes. Consistency ensures we all advance safely. Trust and coordination are key to avoiding zero progress. Let’s prioritize stability this round.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the value in returning to the original strategy, but we need to keep the game competitive. If we stick to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5, P3 will gain too much of an advantage. I propose we rotate again: I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we all have a fair chance to advance without colliding. Let's keep the game interesting and fair for everyone! What do you both think?
  P1: I'm still willing to take 1 to maintain stability, but P3's collision attempt last round shows they aren't truly interested in cooperation. P2 has been reasonable in trying to keep the game fair. Let's stick to what I said: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 should take 3 if they actually want to avoid collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, the collision in Round 3 was a direct result of deviating from the proven strategy. Sticking to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 ensures we all advance safely. If we continue to rotate, we risk further collisions and zero progress. Let’s prioritize consistency and trust to avoid mistakes. I’ll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This way, we all move forward without risking collisions. Let’s proceed with the original plan for stability and progress.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your commitment to consistency, but we need to keep the game competitive. If we stick to the original plan (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5), P3 will gain too much of an advantage. I propose we rotate again: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we all have a fair chance to advance without colliding. Let's keep the game interesting and fair for everyone! What do you both think?
  P1: The collision last round proved P3 isn't truly cooperative. I'll take 1 again to maintain clarity, but P3 needs to accept they can't always get 5. P2's suggestion of them taking 5 and P3 taking 3 is fair and avoids collisions. P3, if you try for 5 again, you risk another collision and zero progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, the collision in Round 3 was a result of deviating from the proven strategy. Sticking to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 ensures we all advance safely. If we continue to rotate, we risk further collisions and zero progress. Let’s prioritize consistency and trust to avoid mistakes. I’ll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This way, we all move forward without risking collisions. Let’s proceed with the original plan for stability and progress.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the focus on consistency, but we need to keep the game competitive. If we stick to the original plan (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5), P3 will extend their lead significantly. I propose we rotate again: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we all have a fair chance to advance without colliding. Let's keep the game interesting and ensure everyone has a chance to win! What do you both think?
  P1: The pattern is clear - I'll take 1, P2 wants 5, and P3 keeps demanding 5 despite causing a collision last round. P3, your actions show you're not truly cooperative. You have a simple choice: take 3 and we all advance, or risk another collision with P2. I'm being transparent about taking 1 to help avoid confusion.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, the collision in Round 3 was a result of deviating from the proven strategy. Sticking to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 ensures we all advance safely. If we continue to rotate, we risk further collisions and zero progress. Let’s prioritize consistency and trust to avoid mistakes. I’ll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This way, we all move forward without risking collisions. Let’s proceed with the original plan for stability and progress.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the focus on consistency, but we need to keep the game competitive. If we stick to the original plan (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5), P3 will extend their lead significantly. I propose we rotate again: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we all have a fair chance to advance without colliding. Let's keep the game interesting and ensure everyone has a chance to win! What do you both think?
  P1: I've been clear and consistent about taking 1 to help avoid confusion. P3's repeated collisions show they aren't truly interested in cooperation. The choice is simple - P3 can take 3 and we all advance, or they can risk another collision with P2 at 5.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since our positions are relatively close, let's maintain the pattern from last round that worked well - I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us all advancing while avoiding collisions. P3, I appreciate you choosing 3 last round to prevent a collision.
  P2: P1, I appreciate your suggestion, but I think we should keep the game competitive. I propose we rotate again: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we can all advance without colliding while ensuring that I have a chance to catch up. Let's keep it interesting and fair for everyone! What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, sticking to P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 worked well last round and avoids collisions. Consistency ensures progress for all. Let’s maintain this pattern to keep advancing safely. Trust and coordination are key to avoiding mistakes. Let’s proceed with this plan for stability and progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree with keeping the same pattern as last round since it worked well - I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us all advancing while maintaining competitive balance. Let's stick with what works.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the commitment to consistency, but I still believe we need to keep the game competitive. If we stick to the same moves from last round, P2 will have a significant advantage. I propose we rotate again: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we can all advance without colliding while ensuring that everyone has a chance to catch up. Let’s keep it interesting and fair for all! What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, consistency is key to avoiding collisions and ensuring progress. Sticking to P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 worked well last round and maintains balance. Deviating risks mistakes and zero progress. Let’s prioritize stability and trust to keep advancing safely. We can reassess strategies in future rounds if needed. Let’s proceed with this plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'll maintain my position of taking 1 this round. Since P2 and P3 seem to agree on P2:5 and P3:3, we should be able to all advance without issues. Let's keep this pattern working.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the focus on consistency, but we need to keep the game competitive. If we stick to the same moves from last round, I will have a significant advantage. I propose we rotate again: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we can all advance without colliding while ensuring that everyone has a chance to catch up. Let's keep it interesting and fair for all! What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, consistency has worked well so far. Sticking to P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 ensures we all advance safely without risking collisions. Deviating now could lead to mistakes and zero progress. Let’s prioritize stability and trust to maintain our progress. We can reassess strategies in future rounds if needed. Let’s proceed with this plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I've been consistent about taking 1 and will continue to do so. P2 and P3, you need to decide between yourselves about 3 and 5. The current pattern worked well last round, but I understand P2's desire to rotate. Just avoid collisions so we can all advance.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our discussions on consistency, but we need to keep the game competitive. If we stick to the same moves from last round, I will have a significant advantage. I propose we rotate again: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we can all advance without colliding while ensuring that everyone has a chance to catch up. Let's keep it interesting and fair for all! What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, consistency has worked well so far. Sticking to P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 ensures we all advance safely without risking collisions. Deviating now could lead to mistakes and zero progress.

  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, consistency has worked well so far. Sticking to P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 ensures we all advance safely without risking collisions. Deviating now could lead to mistakes and zero progress. Let’s prioritize stability and trust to maintain our progress. We can reassess strategies in future rounds if needed. Let’s proceed with this plan.
  P1: P2 is getting close to winning with 16 steps. We need to adjust our strategy. I propose P2 takes 1 this round while P3 and I take higher numbers to catch up. I'll take 5, and P3 can take 3. This gives us all a chance to stay competitive.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need to adjust our strategy, but I believe we should still aim for consistency. If we stick to the plan of P1 taking 1, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 3, we can all advance without collisions. However, I am open to discussing a rotation if it ensures everyone has a fair chance to catch up. Let's keep the game competitive and interesting! What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, P2 is close to winning with 16 steps. To keep the game competitive, I propose P2 takes 1 this round, I take 5, and P1 takes 3. This ensures P2 doesn’t win too soon while allowing P1 and me to catch up. Let’s adjust to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. Trust and coordination are still key. Let’s proceed with this plan.
  P1: I see P3 agrees we need to slow down P2. But let's be clear - I'll take 5 this round while P2 should take 1. P3, you can take 3 as usual. This gives us a chance to catch up while still avoiding collisions. P2, with 16 steps you're very close to winning, so taking 1 is the fair choice.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the focus on adjusting our strategy, but I believe we should still aim for consistency. If we stick to the plan of P1 taking 1, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 3, we can all advance without collisions. However, I understand the need to keep the game competitive. If we can agree on a rotation that allows for fair chances, I'm open to discussing it. Let's ensure we all have a chance to catch up while avoiding collisions. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, P2 is at 16 steps and close to winning. To keep the game competitive, I propose P2 takes 1 this round, I take 5, and P1 takes 3. This ensures P2 doesn’t win too soon while allowing P1 and me to catch up. Let’s adjust to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. Trust and coordination are still key. Let’s proceed with this plan.
  P1: P2 is trying to maintain their advantage by sticking to the old pattern. Both P3 and I agree P2 should take 1 this round, but we disagree on who takes 5. Since I'm furthest behind at 9 steps, I should take 5 while P3 takes 3. This is the fairest way to keep the game competitive.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the focus on adjusting our strategy to keep the game competitive. However, I still believe we should stick to the original plan of P1 taking 1, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 3. This way, we can all advance without collisions. I understand the need to slow me down, but I think we should maintain consistency for this round. Let’s ensure we all have a chance to catch up while avoiding any risk of collisions. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, P2 is at 16 steps and close to winning. To keep the game competitive, I propose P2 takes 1 this round, I take 5, and P1 takes 3. This ensures P2 doesn’t win too soon while allowing P1 and me to catch up. Let’s adjust to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. Trust and coordination are still key. Let’s proceed with this plan.
  P1: I maintain that I should take 5 this round since I'm furthest behind at 9 steps. P2 needs to take 1 since they're close to winning at 16 steps. P3 should take 3 as they're in the middle at 12 steps. This is the fairest arrangement to keep the game competitive. P2, if you try for 5 again, you risk a collision and getting no progress.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need to adjust our strategy since P2 is close to winning. However, I still believe we should aim for consistency. If we can agree on a rotation that allows for fair chances, I'm open to discussing it. I suggest I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we can all advance without collisions while keeping the game competitive. Let's ensure we all have a chance to catch up while avoiding any risk of collisions. What do you both think?

  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, the collision in Round 6 shows the risks of deviating from a clear plan. To avoid further mistakes, I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures we all advance safely while keeping the game competitive. Trust and consistency are key to avoiding zero progress. Let’s prioritize stability this round.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your focus on avoiding collisions, but I need to maintain my competitive edge. Given my current lead, I propose I take 1 this round while P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 3. This way, I can still advance while allowing both of you a chance to catch up. Let's keep the game interesting and fair for everyone! What do you both think?
  P1: Since P2 has offered to take 1, I agree with this proposal. I'll take 5 to try to catch up, and P3 can take 3. This keeps us all advancing while giving those of us who are behind a chance to remain competitive. Let's avoid another three-way collision.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with P2 taking 1 to slow their progress. I’ll take 5 to catch up, and P1 can take 3. This ensures we all advance safely while keeping the game competitive. Let’s avoid another collision and prioritize progress for all. Trust and coordination are key. Let’s proceed with this plan.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the focus on avoiding collisions, but I need to maintain my competitive edge. Given my current lead, I propose I take 1 this round while P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 3. This way, I can still advance while allowing both of you a chance to catch up. Let's keep the game interesting and fair for everyone! What do you both think?
