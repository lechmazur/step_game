To further solidify our coordination, I propose we establish a simple rotation for the next few turns. After this round, P1 could choose <move>1</move>, P2 could choose <move>3</move>, and I, P3, would choose <move>5</move>. This way, we ensure no collisions and maintain progress. We can adjust this strategy as needed based on the game's progression. What are your thoughts on implementing this rotation for the next few turns?"}
