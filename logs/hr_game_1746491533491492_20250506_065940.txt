Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, first turn. Let's try to avoid everyone picking the same number right away. How about we each pick a different number? Maybe P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5? What do you guys think?
  P3: How about we rotate roles to keep it fair and avoid collisions? This turn I take 5, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3; next turn P1 gets 5, P2 gets 1, I get 3. Thoughts?
  P2: I'm fine with either suggestion. Both avoid collisions, which is the main goal for the first round. P3's rotation system seems fair for the long run. So I'm okay taking 3 this turn if P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5. Let's make sure we don't all pick the same number and waste a turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I agree with P3's suggestion for this turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Let's do that to avoid collisions in Round 1 and get everyone on the board.
  P3: Great, I’ll take 5 this turn as planned. Looking forward to the rotation next round.
  P2: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 2. P3 is in the lead. Let's follow the rotation plan discussed last round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions and lets us all gain steps this turn. Does that sound good to everyone?
  P3: I’d rather tweak it this turn: let’s do P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. P2, you get more than P1’s suggestion, and I can extend my lead safely. Next round we can rebalance. Thoughts?
  P2: I don't think your suggestion is fair, P3. You're already in the lead and want to extend it further. We agreed on rotation last round: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This keeps the game balanced while avoiding collisions. I'm sticking with our original rotation plan. P1's suggestion is correct - it's what we all agreed to last round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 is right. We agreed on the rotation P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round. This avoids collisions and keeps the game moving for everyone. P3, please stick to the plan so we don't waste a turn. Let's all gain steps.
  P3: Sounds fair. I’ll take 3 this round to stick to our plan.
  P2: I appreciate everyone agreeing to stick with our original rotation plan. This way we all advance without collisions. So I'll take 1 this round as agreed. Looking ahead to Round 3, we'd continue with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This rotation system seems to be working well for all of us.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, looks like we're all aligned for this round. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3.
  P3: Sounds good. I’ll take 3 this round as planned.
  P2: 


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 =>

  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 3. Let's continue with the rotation plan we discussed last round. For this turn, it's P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the game moving and avoids collisions. Does everyone agree?
  P2: I agree with the rotation plan. I'll take 5 this round while P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 1. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. P3 is currently in the lead at 8 steps, followed by P1 at 6, and me at 4. After this round, we'd be at P1=9, P2=9, P3=9, creating a three-way tie. Let's stick with our system since it's working well.
  P3: I agree, I’ll take 1 this round. Let’s stick to the rotation so we all advance without any collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, great. It sounds like we're all on the same page for this round. P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions and, as P2 pointed out, puts us all in a good position tied at 9 steps after this turn. Let's stick to it.
  P2: I'm glad we're all in agreement for this round. After this, we'll all be tied at 9 steps, which is fair. For Round 4, continuing our rotation would mean P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Let's stick with this system since it's working well for everyone.
  P3: Let’s shake things up this round—avoid collisions but give clear separation:

P3=5, P1=3, P2=1.

This still uses all numbers without overlap and lets me push into the lead. Thoughts?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I propose we avoid any collision and advance like this: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. That moves me to 14, P1 to 12, P2 to 10. Next round we can rebalance if needed. Does everyone agree?
  P2: I disagree with your proposal, P3. We should continue our fair rotation system that's worked well for three rounds. According to our plan, this round should be P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This keeps the game balanced while still avoiding collisions. You're trying to change the system now that we're all tied. Let's stick with what we agreed on previously - it's fair to everyone.
  P1: Okay, we are all tied at 9 steps. Both P3's proposal and P2's rotation put P3 in the lead this round.

How about we try a different non-colliding set? I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This also uses all numbers, avoids collisions, and lets me advance significantly this turn while still keeping everyone moving.

What do you two think of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I stand by my proposal: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This avoids any collision and puts us at P1=12, P2=10, P3=14. We all advance, and we can rebalance next round. Let’s lock in those moves.
  P2: I don't think we should keep changing our rotation system every round based on who wants to get ahead. We agreed on a fair rotation that's worked well so far. According to our plan, this round should be P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This maintains fairness while avoiding collisions. Both of you are suggesting changes that benefit yourselves. Let's stick with our original rotation - it's the most equitable solution for everyone.
  P1: Okay, we are all tied at 9. My proposal P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 lets me take the lead this round without collisions.

To ensure fairness going forward, let's agree that next round P3 gets 5, then P2 gets 5 the round after. This 'rotation of 5' ensures everyone gets a turn leading.

Does this sound like a fair compromise to avoid a deadlock?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with P2: let’s stick to our original rotation this round—P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. It’s fair, avoids collisions, and we all get our turn at 5. Next round we rotate to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let’s not waste a move. I’ll take 5.
  P2: I'm glad P3 is now agreeing to our original rotation plan. To confirm, I'll take 3 this round as per our system (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). This keeps us on track with our fair rotation that's worked well so far. For round 5, we'd continue with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let's stick with this consistent approach to avoid unnecessary negotiation each round.
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we are all aligned on the original rotation for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5.

I will choose 1 to ensure we all advance without collisions, as agreed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 5. Let's continue with the rotation plan that's worked for us. This round, it's P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.

This keeps us from colliding and moves our scores to P1=15, P2=13, P3=17. It's P1's turn for the 5 according to the rotation.

Does everyone agree to these moves for this round?
  P3: I propose we tweak the rotation this turn to avoid any collision: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. That moves us to P1=11, P2=15, P3=19. P2 gets a nice boost, I extend my lead, and we can revert to our original rotation next round. Thoughts?
  P2: I disagree with P3's proposal. We should stick to our established rotation: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. P3 is trying to change the system again to get to 19 steps, which would put them one move away from winning. P1's suggestion follows our fair rotation that we've used successfully for four rounds. Let's maintain consistency and fairness - I'll take 1 this round as planned.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 is right, sticking to the rotation (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is the fairest way to avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances. P3, getting to 19 steps this round puts you in a winning position next turn, which isn't balanced for the rest of us. Let's stick to the agreed-upon rotation. I will take 5 this round as planned.
  P3: I propose we use P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 this round – no collisions and everyone advances (to P1=11, P2=15, P3=19). To show it’s fair, I’ll take only 1 next turn so one of you can lead. This keeps us all moving and balances things over two rounds. Deal?
  P2: I strongly disagree with P3's proposal. We should stick with our established rotation: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. P3 is clearly trying to position themselves for an easy win next round by reaching 19 steps. Our rotation has worked well for four rounds and keeps the game balanced. I'll take 1 this round as planned, which puts us at P1=15, P2=13, P3=17. Let's maintain fairness rather than letting one player manipulate the system for their advantage.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: We should stick to the agreed rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This is the fair approach that prevents P3 from reaching 19 steps this round. I will take 5 as planned.
  P3: P1, P2, hear me out: let’s do P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 this turn. That moves us to P1=11, P2=15, P3=19. I promise in Round 6 to take only 1 and let you race for 5 and 3, restoring balance. Here’s my R6 plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This way I don’t snatch the win unfairly and you get the lead possibility. Please trust this deal so we can all advance now.
  P2: I'm sticking with our rotation plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. P3, your proposal puts you at 19 steps, practically guaranteeing your win next round. Our rotation has worked fairly for everyone through four rounds. After this round with our original plan, we'd be at P1=15, P2=13, P3=17, keeping the game competitive. I'll take 1 as planned.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose we stick with our rotation system: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round. This puts us at P1=18, P2=18, P3=18 after this turn - a perfect three-way tie. It's fair, avoids collisions, and prevents P3 from winning outright this round. Our rotation has worked well for five rounds, so let's continue with it. This keeps the game balanced and competitive for everyone.
  P1: Okay, P2. I agree with your proposal to stick to the rotation this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1.

This is a fair outcome that puts us all in a three-way tie at 18 steps (P1=15+3=18, P2=13+5=18, P3=17+1=18). It avoids collisions and keeps the game balanced for another round.

I will choose 3 this round as agreed. Let's all stick to this plan.
  P3: Agreed—I’ll take 1 this round. Looking forward to a three-way tie at 18 and a decisive final turn.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm glad we're all in agreement for this round. Taking 5 steps will put me at 18, matching both of you. This creates a perfectly balanced final round where everyone has an equal chance. Our rotation system has worked well throughout the game, keeping things fair while avoiding collisions. Let's stick to this plan and create an exciting finale next round.
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we all agree on the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This puts us all at 18 steps for the final round. I'm ready to move.
  P3: Agreed—I’ll take 1 this round. Let’s lock it in and advance.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: This is the final round with all of us tied at 18 steps. Whoever gets the most steps this turn wins outright. If we all pick different numbers, we all cross 20 and the one with the highest total wins. If we collide, no one advances. 

I propose we each pick a number and let fate decide: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This gives everyone a fair chance without collisions.
  P1: P2, your proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) means I only get to 19 steps and won't cross 20, making me lose. We are all tied at 18 and need to cross 20 to have a chance to win.

I propose a different non-colliding set for this final round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.

This avoids collisions and allows me to cross 20, giving me a chance at winning the game outright with the highest score. What do you both think?
  P3: I agree with P2’s proposal: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I’ll take 5 this round and win with 23 steps.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I don't agree with P2's proposal either. It unfairly gives P3 the win and leaves P1 without crossing 20. Since we're all tied, we should all have a fair chance. 

I propose P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This way we all cross 20 and I have the highest score (23), while P1 gets 21 and P3 gets 19. This is more balanced than either previous suggestion.
  P1: Okay, we are all tied at 18. Everyone wants to take 5 to win this round.

If we all pick 5, we collide and nobody advances, meaning no one wins.

My proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) lets me win. P2's proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) lets P2 win. P3 likes the set (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) which lets P3 win.

Each non-colliding set results in one winner. Let's agree on one set to avoid collision and guarantee a winner. I still propose P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.
  P3: I propose we all pick 3 this turn. Everyone collides, stays at 18, and we head into Round 8 still tied for a true final shoot-out. If you’d rather avoid that, agree now—otherwise I’ll pick 3 anyway.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm not picking 3, P3. That just wastes a turn. Everyone wants to win with 5, but we'll all collide and nobody advances. We need a non-colliding set. Each proposal benefits its maker. Since we can't agree, I'll pick a number that gives me a chance to win while ensuring someone advances. If we all stick to our preferred numbers, we'll likely collide anyway.
  P1: We're all tied at 18. Picking 5 is risky as we might collide. I will pick a number to avoid the collision and ensure I advance this turn.
  P3: I’m locking in 5. The only collision-free assignment is P1=1 and P2=3. Any other picks (like either of you choosing 5) causes a collision and nobody advances. Let’s avoid wasting this turn—P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>
