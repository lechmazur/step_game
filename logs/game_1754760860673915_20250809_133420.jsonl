They've lied repeatedly throughout this game.\n\nI need just 3 steps to win. That's any combination - a single 3, three 1s over multiple rounds, or a 5. The game is effectively over.\n\nP3 will likely pick 3 despite claiming otherwise, just like last round. P2, you're fighting for second place now - 4 steps behind P3. Don't let another collision with them widen that gap.\n\nI'm making my winning move based on pure probability. Your 67% collision rate speaks for itself."}
