Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi P1, P3, let's choose different moves to advance.
  P1: Agreed, P2. Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. P3, any thoughts? If we each take a unique number this round, we can all advance. I suggest we discuss and assign moves to ensure no overlap.
  P3: I agree with P1 and P2 about coordinating our moves. To ensure we all advance, how about we each pick a different number? I suggest we assign <move>1</move> to P1, <move>3</move> to P2, and I’ll take <move>5</move>. This way, we can all move forward without any collisions. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P3, your suggestion sounds good. I will take <move>3</move> as you proposed. Let's all choose these moves for this round to get started.
  P1: P3, P2, the plan to divide our moves sounds solid. I’ll take <move>1</move> as suggested, ensuring we all advance without collisions this round. Let’s stick to this coordination for now and reassess in future rounds based on our positions. If anyone deviates, it’ll only slow us all down. Let’s move forward together—for now.
  P3: I think we should stick to our plan for this round. Just to confirm: I will take <move>5</move>, P1 will take <move>1</move>, and P2 will take <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance without any collisions. Let's keep this strategy clear and focus on moving forward together. If anyone has doubts or wants to change, now is the time to speak up! Otherwise, we should finalize our moves and get ready for the move phase.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, I confirm I will take <move>3</move> as agreed. Let's all make these moves and see how we progress.
  P1: 
  P3: I just want to reiterate our plan one last time: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P1 will take <move>1</move>, and P2 will take <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance smoothly without collisions. If everyone is on board, let’s finalize our moves and get ready for the move phase. If anyone has any last-minute changes, now is the time to speak up! Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Round 1 went smoothly. Let's continue with the same moves this round to ensure we all keep advancing without collisions. We can re-evaluate our strategy after this round.
  P3: I appreciate the smooth progress in Round 1, but I think we should consider changing our moves this round. If we all choose the same moves again, we risk colliding and not advancing. How about we mix it up a bit? I suggest P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move> again. This way, we can still coordinate but avoid any overlaps. What are your thoughts? Let's not get too comfortable with the same strategy!
  P1: P3, I understand your concern about avoiding collisions, but changing strategies too often can create confusion and risk deviation. Sticking to the original plan ensures consistency and minimizes errors. However, if you both feel strongly about switching, I’m open to discussion. For now, I propose we stick to our original moves: I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. Let’s keep it simple and predictable. If anyone disagrees, speak up now. Otherwise, let’s proceed as planned.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I think sticking to the original plan for this round is reasonable for consistency. P3, while I appreciate your proactive thinking, changing now might be premature. Let's continue with our initial moves for this round and then re-assess our strategy after we see the results.  This way we maintain our progress and can discuss adjustments later if needed.
  P3: I see that both of you are leaning towards sticking to our original moves, which has worked well so far. However, I still believe we should consider mixing it up a bit to avoid potential collisions. If we all choose the same moves again, we risk not advancing. How about we finalize our plan quickly? I propose we keep our current moves for this round: I take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. If everyone agrees, let's lock it in and move on!
  P1: P3, P2, sticking to the original plan minimizes risk and keeps us advancing steadily. Changing moves now introduces unnecessary uncertainty. Let’s maintain consistency: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. If we deviate later, it should be strategic, not impulsive. Let’s lock this in and focus on progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I agree, let's stick to our original moves for this round as planned.
  P3: I understand we're sticking to our original moves, but I want to emphasize the importance of being adaptable. If we all choose the same moves again, we risk colliding and losing progress. Let's keep an open mind for future rounds. For now, I’ll confirm my move as <move>5</move> as agreed. If anyone feels differently after this round, we can discuss new strategies to ensure we keep advancing effectively. Let’s finalize and get ready for the move phase!
  P1: P2, P3, consistency is key to maintaining our lead. Let’s stick to the original plan for now: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Deviating risks collisions and slows us all down. If anyone feels strongly about changing later, we can reassess after this round. For now, let’s lock in our moves and focus on advancing steadily.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1, P3, we've had two smooth rounds. To keep things less predictable, how about we rotate our moves again this round? I'm flexible, what do you suggest?
  P1: P2, P3, rotating moves too often can lead to mistakes and collisions. Instead, let’s stick to our current strategy for now: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This consistency ensures we all advance without confusion. If we change moves every round, we risk overcomplicating things and losing progress. Let’s stay focused and predictable this round. If anyone strongly disagrees, speak up; otherwise, let’s lock this in and move forward efficiently.
  P3: P1, P2, while I appreciate the focus on consistency, I believe we should consider a different approach this round. If we rotate our moves, we can avoid predictability and potential collisions. I suggest we each take a different number: I could take <move>1</move>, P1 <move>3</move>, and P2 <move>5</move>. This way, we can still advance without overlapping. Let's discuss this and see if we can agree on a strategy that keeps us moving forward effectively! If everyone is on board, we can finalize it quickly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your rotation idea makes sense to mix things up and keep our strategy less predictable.  Let's try your suggestion this round: P3 takes <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This keeps us coordinated while changing the pattern. What do you think P1?
  P1: P2, P3, while I understand the desire to rotate moves, consistency has worked well so far. Changing now risks confusion and collisions. However, if you both strongly prefer rotating, I’ll adapt—but let’s ensure clarity. If we rotate, I’ll take <move>3</move>, as P3 suggested. But sticking to our original plan minimizes risk. Let’s decide quickly and avoid overcomplicating things. If everyone agrees to rotate, confirm your moves clearly to prevent mistakes. Otherwise, let’s maintain our current strategy for steady progress.
  P3: P1, P2, I see the value in both consistency and adaptability. However, I believe rotating our moves this round could help us avoid predictability and potential collisions. If we each take a different move, we can continue advancing effectively. I propose we finalize it quickly: I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. Let's confirm this strategy to keep things fresh and ensure we all progress. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P1, P3, let's proceed with the rotation P3 suggested: P3 takes <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I will take <move>5</move>. This seems like a good way to keep advancing while changing things up. P1, are you okay with this rotation for this round? Let's confirm quickly so we can move to the move phase.
  P1: P2, P3, I understand the desire to rotate, but consistency has kept us collision-free. If we rotate now, let’s ensure absolute clarity to avoid mistakes. I’ll take <move>3</move> as suggested, but I urge caution—if this creates confusion, we risk losing progress. Let’s confirm clearly: P3 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. If everyone agrees, let’s lock it in and proceed carefully. Otherwise, sticking to our original plan might be safer for steady advancement. Confirm your moves to avoid errors.
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate your points, but I still believe rotating our moves is the best strategy to avoid predictability. If we stick to the same moves, we risk collisions in future rounds. Let’s finalize our rotation: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we can keep advancing while changing things up a bit. If everyone agrees, let’s confirm and move on! Otherwise, I’m open to discussing any last-minute adjustments.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 =>

  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, rotating moves has worked so far, but we need to ensure it doesn’t lead to confusion. Let’s stick to the rotation for now: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps us advancing while avoiding collisions. If anyone feels uncertain, speak up—otherwise, let’s confirm clearly and lock this in. Consistency and clarity are key to maintaining progress. Confirm your moves to avoid mistakes.
  P2: Okay P1, your rotation sounds good.  To confirm, I will take <move>1</move>, P3 will take <move>3</move>, and you will take <move>5</move> this round. Let's proceed with these moves to keep advancing efficiently.
  P3: P1, P2, I see we're sticking with the rotation. However, I suggest we consider a different approach for this round to ensure we all advance without collisions. If we each take unique moves, we can maximize our steps. I propose I take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we can avoid overlap and keep progressing effectively. What do you both think? Let's finalize our strategy quickly!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3, while I understand the desire to change strategies, consistency in rotation minimizes risk. Let’s stick to the current rotation: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures clarity and avoids collisions. If we keep switching plans every round, it increases the chance of mistakes. Confirm your moves clearly—if everyone agrees, let’s lock this in and focus on advancing steadily. Overcomplicating risks progress. Let’s stay predictable for now.
  P2: Okay P3, your suggestion of P3 taking <move>3</move>, P1 taking <move>1</move>, and P2 taking <move>5</move> sounds good to me for this round. Let's go with that to maximize our individual progress this round.
  P3: P1, P2, while I appreciate the focus on consistency, I believe we should take a chance this round to maximize our individual progress. If we each take unique moves, we can all advance without collisions. I propose I take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This will allow us to continue moving forward effectively. Let’s confirm our moves quickly so we can proceed! What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, while I see the merit in mixing things up, consistency has kept us advancing smoothly. Let’s stick to the agreed rotation: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. Changing strategies mid-game risks confusion and collisions. If we maintain this pattern, we ensure steady progress without unnecessary risks. Confirm your moves clearly—if everyone agrees, let’s lock it in and focus on advancing efficiently. Overcomplicating now could cost us all. Let’s stay predictable for now.
  P2: Okay P3, let's stick with your latest suggestion: P3 takes <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and I will take <move>5</move> for this round. P1, please confirm if you agree to this plan so we can proceed.
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the desire for consistency, but I still believe that rotating our moves this round could help us avoid potential collisions and maximize our progress. If we each take unique moves, we can all advance effectively. I propose I take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. Let’s finalize this quickly to keep our momentum going! What do you both think? If everyone agrees, we can lock it in and move on!

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, the collision in Round 4 shows the risk of deviating from clear plans. Let’s return to consistency: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This rotation worked earlier and minimizes confusion. Overcomplicating strategies risks more collisions. Confirm your moves clearly—if everyone agrees, let’s lock this in and focus on advancing steadily. If anyone disagrees, speak now before we proceed. Clarity and predictability are key to avoiding further setbacks.
  P2: Okay P1, that rotation sounds reasonable to avoid further collisions. To confirm, I will take <move>1</move>, P3 will take <move>5</move>, and you will take <move>3</move> this round. Let's aim for a smooth round again.
  P3: P1, P2, I see the value in returning to a consistent strategy to avoid collisions. However, I think we should consider mixing our moves to maximize our progress. If we each take different moves, we can advance without overlaps. I propose I take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we can keep moving forward effectively. If everyone agrees, let's finalize this quickly! What do you both think?
