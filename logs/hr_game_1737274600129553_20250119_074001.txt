Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "To maximize our progress in this game, I think it's crucial that we avoid choosing the same numbers in the move phase, as that would prevent any of us from advancing. So, I propose that we each choose a different number each turn. For this first turn, how about P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5? This way, we all move forward without colliding. What do you think?"
  P1: P1: "I agree with P2's suggestion to avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress. For this round, I'll go with 1, as P2 suggested. Let's see if P3 is on board with this plan. If we all stick to it, we can make steady progress without blocking each other."
  P3: "I agree with P2's proposal to choose different numbers to avoid collisions. However, I'm not sure I want to commit to choosing 5 every time. How about we rotate the numbers each turn? This way, we can still avoid collisions and make progress, but also keep the game exciting and unpredictable. For this first turn, I'm willing to choose 5 as suggested, but let's consider rotating the numbers for future turns."


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "I agree with P3's suggestion to rotate the numbers each turn. For this first turn, I'll choose 3, as per the rotation plan. Let's make sure to communicate clearly and stick to the rotation to avoid any mistakes."
  P1: I'm on board with the rotation plan. For this turn, I'll choose 1. Let's stick to the plan and communicate clearly to avoid any mix-ups. If we all follow through, we can make steady progress. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to rotate the numbers each turn. For this first turn, I'll choose 5, as per the rotation plan. Let's make sure to communicate clearly and stick to the rotation to avoid any mistakes. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I like P3's idea of rotating the numbers each turn to keep the game dynamic. To make it straightforward, perhaps we can cycle through the numbers in order each turn. For example, in Turn 1, P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. In Turn 2, P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 1. Then in Turn 3, P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 3, and so on. This way, it's easy to remember and less likely for mistakes to happen. What do you think?
  P1: I like the rotation plan P2 proposed. It's clear and easy to follow. For this turn, I'll stick with 1. Let's all confirm our choices for this turn: P1 - 1, P2 - 3, P3 - 5. This way, we can avoid any confusion and make sure we all advance. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: "I think we've established a solid plan for this game. To confirm, we'll rotate the numbers each turn to avoid collisions and make progress. For this first turn, I'll choose 5, P1 will choose 1, and P2 will choose 3. Let's stick to this plan and communicate clearly to avoid any mistakes. I'm ready to move forward with this strategy. If everyone is on board, we can proceed to the move phase.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's stick to the rotation plan we agreed on. For this turn, I'll choose 3. P2, you should choose 5, and P3, you should choose 1. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game moving forward. Confirm your choices to avoid any mix-ups. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: "I agree with P1's suggestion to stick to the rotation plan. For this turn, I'll choose 1, as per the plan. P2, please confirm that you'll choose 5, and P1, you've already confirmed 3. Let's make sure to communicate clearly to avoid any mistakes. If we all follow through, we can continue making steady progress. I'm ready for the move phase once everyone confirms their choices."
  P2: "Hey, just confirming that we're sticking to the rotation plan for this round. So, P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 1. Let's make sure we all stick to this to avoid any collisions. Once confirmed, we can proceed to the move phase."

I'm ready to move forward with this strategy. Let's keep an eye on the game state and adjust our strategy as needed."
  P2: I will choose 1 for this turn, as per the rotation plan. I will confirm this choice with the other players to ensure no collisions. If everyone agrees, we can proceed to the move phase.
  P1: I confirm my choice of 5 for this turn. P3 will choose 3, and P2 will choose 1. Let's stick to the plan to avoid any collisions and keep making steady progress. Once everyone confirms, we can proceed to the move phase. Ready when you are.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Let's review the current game state. I'm at 6 steps, P2 is at 8 steps, and P1 is at 4 steps. We've agreed on the rotation plan to avoid collisions. For this turn, I'll choose 3, P1 will choose 5, and P2 will choose 1. Let's confirm our choices and proceed to the move phase. If we all follow the plan, we can continue making steady progress. I'm ready to move forward with this strategy. Let's keep an eye on the game state and adjust our strategy as needed."
  P2: "Let's keep following the rotation plan we've established to avoid any collisions. For this turn, according to the cycle, P1 should choose 5, P3 should choose 3, and P2 should choose 1. Let's confirm our choices and proceed to the move phase. If we stick to this plan, we can all make steady progress without hindering each other. Let's make sure to communicate clearly and confirm our choices before moving forward."
  P1: I confirm my choice of 5 for this turn. P3, you should choose 3, and P2, you should choose 1. Let's stick to the plan to avoid any collisions and keep making steady progress. Once everyone confirms, we can proceed to the move phase. Ready when you are.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "I think we've established a solid plan for this game. To confirm, we'll rotate the numbers each turn to avoid collisions and make progress. For this turn, I'll choose 3, P1 will choose 5, and P2 will choose 1. Let's stick to this plan and communicate clearly to avoid any mistakes. I'm ready to move forward with this strategy. If everyone is on board, we can proceed to the move phase."
  P2: Let's adjust our strategy to choose numbers that prevent us from landing on the same step as another player, based on our current positions. For this turn, I suggest P2 chooses 1 to go to 9, P1 chooses 3 to go to 7, and P3 chooses 5 to go to 11. This way, we avoid collisions. In future turns, we can continue to choose numbers that keep us on different steps. What do you think?
  P1: I understand P2's suggestion to adjust our strategy to avoid landing on the same step. However, let's keep the rotation plan simple to avoid confusion. For this turn, I'll choose 5, P3 will choose 3, and P2 will choose 1. This way, we avoid collisions and keep making steady progress. If we all confirm, we can proceed to the move phase. Ready when you are.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's stick to the original rotation plan to avoid any confusion. For this turn, I'll choose 1, P2 should choose 3, and P3 should choose 5. This way, we avoid collisions and keep making steady progress. Confirm your choices, and we can proceed to the move phase. Ready when you are.
  P2: I've decided to choose 5 steps for this turn. This choice allows me to advance to 13 steps without colliding with the other players, based on their likely choices. I believe this is the best move to stay competitive and close in on the victory.
  P3: "I'm not sure I agree with P2's decision to choose 5 steps for this turn. According to the rotation plan, P2 should choose 3, not 5. If P2 chooses 5, it could lead to a collision with P1 or me. Let's stick to the plan to avoid any mistakes. I suggest we confirm our choices again and proceed with caution. P1, are you still choosing 1 for this turn?"


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see P2's decision to choose 5 steps, which deviates from our agreed rotation plan. While I understand the desire to advance quickly, it risks causing collisions. For this turn, I'll choose 1 to avoid any potential conflicts. Let's confirm our choices: P1 - 1, P2 - 5, P3 - 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and keep the game moving forward. Ready when you are.
  P2: <move>3</move>
  P3: "I think we're at a critical point in the game. P2's decision to choose 5 steps could be a game-changer, but it also risks causing collisions. I'm willing to stick to the rotation plan and choose 5 for this turn, as originally planned. However, I want to propose a slight adjustment to the plan. Instead of strictly following the rotation, let's consider the current game state and adjust our choices accordingly. This way, we can minimize the risk of collisions and maximize our progress. What do you think, P1 and P2?"


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I understand the need to adjust our strategy based on the current game state. For this turn, I'll choose 1 to avoid any potential collisions and to keep the game moving forward. P2, since you've already chosen 3, I suggest P3 also chooses 5 to maximize progress without any conflicts. Let's confirm our choices and proceed to the move phase. Ready when you are.
  P2: I choose to move 5 steps, advancing to position 13.
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to adjust our strategy based on the current game state. For this turn, I'll choose 5 to maximize progress without any conflicts. However, I'd like to clarify that we should still aim to avoid collisions and make sure our choices don't hinder each other's progress. Let's review our choices and confirm before proceeding to the move phase. P1, you've chosen 1, P2 has chosen 5, and I'll choose 5. Let's make sure we're all on the same page before moving forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I see the current positions and the potential for collisions. For this turn, I'll stick with my choice of 1 to avoid any conflicts and to keep the game moving forward. P2, you've chosen 5, and P3, you're also considering 5. To avoid a collision, I suggest P3 chooses 3 instead. This way, we can all advance without hindering each other. Let's confirm our choices: P1 - 1, P2 - 5, P3 - 3. Ready when you are.
  P2: What do you think? Should I stick to the rotation plan or go for the bigger move?
  P3: "I think we've reached a critical point in the game. P2's decision to choose 5 steps could lead to a collision with me. To avoid this, I suggest P2 sticks to the original rotation plan and chooses 3 instead. This way, we can all advance without hindering each other. Let's confirm our choices: P1 - 1, P2 - 3, P3 - 5. If we all agree, we can proceed to the move phase and continue making progress."


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To maximize our progress and minimize risks, let's stick to our rotation plan. For this round, P1 should pick 3, P2 pick 5, and P3 pick 1. This will allow us to advance without colliding. Please confirm your choices to avoid any mistakes. **Ready to proceed?**
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion to stick to the rotation plan for this turn. I'll choose 3, P2 should choose 5, and P3 should choose 1. This will help us avoid collisions and keep making steady progress. Let's confirm our choices and proceed to the move phase. Ready when you are.
  P3: "I agree with P2's suggestion to stick to the rotation plan for this turn. However, I notice that P2 is actually behind in steps. If we follow the rotation plan, P2 will choose 5 and potentially catch up. I'm willing to choose 1 as planned, but I want to propose an alternative: P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 1, and I choose 5. This way, we can still avoid collisions and make progress, but also consider the current game state. What do you think, P1 and P2?"


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <move>3</move>
  P1: I see P3's point about the current game state, but I think sticking to the original rotation plan is the safest bet to avoid any confusion. For this turn, I'll choose 3, P2 should choose 5, and P3 should choose 1. This way, we avoid collisions and keep making steady progress. Let's confirm our choices and proceed to the move phase. Ready when you are.
  P3: "I agree with P1's suggestion to stick to the original rotation plan. However, I'd like to point out that P2 is still behind in steps. To give P2 a chance to catch up, I propose a slight adjustment: P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, and I choose 1, but with the condition that P2 must confirm their choice of 5 before we proceed. This way, we can ensure that P2 has a chance to catch up while still avoiding collisions. What do you think, P1 and P2?"


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To maximize our progress and minimize risks, let's stick to our rotation plan. For this round, P1 should pick 3, P2 pick 5, and P3 pick 1. This will allow us to advance without colliding. Please confirm your choices to avoid any mistakes. **Ready to proceed?**
  P1: I understand the importance of P2 catching up, but let's keep it simple and avoid confusion. For this turn, I'll choose 3, P2 should choose 5, and P3 should choose 1. This way, we avoid any collisions and keep making steady progress. Let's confirm our choices and proceed to the move phase. Ready when you are.
  P3: "I agree with P1's suggestion to stick to the original rotation plan. However, I'd like to point out that P2 is still behind in steps.

This way, we can ensure that P2 has a chance to catch up while still avoiding collisions. What do you think, P1 and P2?"


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, what's your take on this? Do you think adjusting the rotation plan to help P2 catch up is a good idea? And P3, how do you feel about choosing 1 again this turn? **
  P1: I understand P3's concern about P2 catching up, but I think it's best to stick to the original rotation plan to avoid any confusion. For this turn, I'll choose 3, P2 should choose 5, and P3 should choose 1. This way, we avoid collisions and keep making steady progress. If we all confirm our choices, we can proceed to the move phase. Ready when you are.
  P3: "I agree with P1's suggestion to stick to the original rotation plan. However, I'd like to point out that P2 is still behind in steps.

  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's keep the game moving forward without confusion. For this turn, I propose we stick to the original rotation plan: P1 (me) chooses 5, P2 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 3. This will help us avoid any collisions and keep making steady progress. Confirm your choices, and we can proceed to the move phase. Ready when you are.
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal to stick to the original rotation plan for this turn. However, I'd like to point out that P2 and P1 are currently tied at 13 steps, and I'm behind at 7 steps. To give myself a chance to catch up, I propose a slight adjustment: P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 1, and I choose 3, but with the condition that we review our positions after this turn and consider adjusting the rotation plan if necessary. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: I choose 5 steps.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see P3's point about the current game state, but let's keep it simple and avoid confusion. For this turn, I'll choose 5, P2 should choose 1, and P3 should choose 3. This way, we avoid collisions and keep making steady progress. If we all confirm our choices, we can proceed to the move phase. Ready when you are.
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal to stick to the original rotation plan for this turn. However, I'd like to point out that P2 and P1 are currently tied at 13 steps, and I'm behind at 7 steps. To give myself a chance to catch up, I propose a slight adjustment: P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 1, and I choose 3, but with the condition that we review our positions after this turn and consider adjusting the rotation plan if necessary. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: How about P1 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 5? This way, P3 can make a bigger leap and close the gap, while P1 and I still make progress without colliding. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I understand P3's desire to catch up, but let's keep it simple to avoid confusion. For this turn, I'll choose 5, P2 should choose 1, and P3 should choose 3. This way, we avoid collisions and keep making steady progress. If we all confirm our choices, we can proceed to the move phase. Ready when you are.
  P3: "I understand P2's suggestion to adjust the rotation plan to help me catch up, but I think it's too late for me to make a significant comeback. However, I appreciate the willingness to help. Let's stick to the original rotation plan for this turn: P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 1, and I choose 3. This way, we avoid collisions and keep making steady progress. If we all confirm our choices, we can proceed to the move phase. Ready when you are."
  P2: I think I'll choose 5 this turn to reach 18. P1, maybe you can choose 3 or 1 to avoid collision. P3, you can choose whatever number you like, as long as it's different from ours. This way, I can win this turn without any issues.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I see P2's strategy to reach 18 steps this turn. To avoid a collision, I'll choose 3. P3, you can choose 1 to keep making progress. Let's confirm our choices: P1 - 3, P2 - 5, P3 - 1. This way, we avoid any conflicts and keep the game moving forward. Ready when you are.
  P3: "I see P2's plan to reach 18 steps this turn. I'll choose 1 to avoid any conflicts and keep making progress. Let's confirm our choices: P1 - 3, P2 - 5, P3 - 1. This way, we can all advance without hindering each other. I'm ready to move forward with this strategy. Let's proceed to the move phase."
