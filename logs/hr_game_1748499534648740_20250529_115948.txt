Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s avoid any collisions. In Round 1 I’ll take 5, P2 take 3 and P1 take 1—so we all advance. Next turn we rotate: P1→3, P3→1, P2→5, then P1→5, P2→1, P3→3, etc., keeping us conflict‐free.
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal to avoid collisions by choosing different numbers. To confirm, I'll choose <move>3</move> this round. Let's follow the rotation P3 suggested: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. So, next round P1 should choose 3, I should choose 5, and P3 should choose 1. Let's stick to this plan unless someone has a better idea.
  P1: I agree with P3's proposal to avoid collisions. I'll follow the rotation plan for Round 1. Let's all advance cleanly.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To confirm, according to the agreed rotation plan, in Round 2, P1 should choose 3, I (P2) should choose 5, and P3 should choose 1. I'll stick to it unless someone objects or has a better plan. Let's keep moving smoothly. If anyone is considering deviating, please speak up now.
  P1: I agree with the current plan for Round 2 to avoid collisions. Let's all follow the rotation: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Consistency will keep us advancing smoothly.
  P3: I’ll stick with 1 this round to keep trust, but here’s a tweak for Round 3: let P1 take 3, P2 take 1, and I take 5. That breaks the tie-pattern and gives us a clear leader. After that we can return to a balanced rotation. Anyone object?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm fine with P3's tweak for Round 3. To confirm, for Round 3: P1 will take 3, I (P2) will take 1, and P3 will take 5. This change will indeed break the pattern and potentially create a leader. Let's follow this adjusted plan for Round 3. I suggest we revisit the original rotation plan in Round 4 to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. Let's keep the momentum going.
  P1: I agree with the Round 2 and 3 plans as discussed. However, P3 has already taken 5 once and will take it again in Round 3, while I've only taken low numbers (1 and 3). For fairness, in Round 4, I should take 5, P2 take 3, and P3 take 1. This balances our progress and maintains trust. Let's confirm this adjustment early to avoid last-minute chaos.
  P3: I think P1’s R4 plan ties us all at 12. Instead, for Round 4 let’s do P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. That avoids collisions and gives clear separation (I take 3). Anyone object?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To confirm the plans for the upcoming rounds: we've agreed on the moves for Round 2 and adjusted the plan for Round 3. For Round 4, P3 suggested P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I think this is a good plan as it avoids collisions and maintains separation. Let's stick to this plan unless someone has a strong objection or a better alternative. I'm ready to move forward with the agreed plans.
  P1: I accept the Round 2 and 3 plans. For Round 4, P3's proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is workable, but it gives P3 a clear lead (14 steps) while I lag (12). To ensure fairness and trust, I propose that in Round 5, I take 5 again to balance progress, with P2 and P3 adjusting accordingly. Let's finalize Round 5 details next turn.
  P3: I agree on R2–4. For Round 5, instead of P1 taking 5 again, let’s do: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. That avoids collisions, puts me at 19, and lets me finish solo next turn. Any objections?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I see P3's plan gives them a clear path to 19 by Round 5 while I lag at 13. This imbalance hurts fairness. For Round 3, I propose we swap: **I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1**. This keeps us collision-free and balances scores: P1:9, P2:11, P3:7. We can then negotiate Round 4 openly. Trust requires equitable gains—don’t force me to deviate defensively.
  P2: To maintain fairness and balance, I reject P1's proposal to swap moves for Round 3. The original plan for Round 3 was P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Sticking to it is crucial. If we deviate now, it may lead to mistrust. Let's follow the agreed plan: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us on track and avoids last-minute chaos. Let's confirm our moves for Round 3 and then discuss Round 4.
  P3: I agree with P2—let’s stick to our Round 3 plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Deviating now risks collisions and breaks trust. After Round 3, we can revisit Round 4 to address any fairness concerns.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I proposed a fair swap for Round 3 to balance scores, but you reject it. Following the original plan leaves me far behind (7 vs. P3's 11). That’s unsustainable. If forced, I may defensively pick 5, risking collision with P3’s 5—hurting us both. Accept my swap: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This avoids chaos and maintains trust. We can renegotiate Round 4 fairly.
  P2: To avoid a potential collision and maintain trust, I will stick to the original plan for Round 3: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. I will choose <move>1</move> this round. Let's proceed with the agreed plan and discuss Round 4 in the next conversation phase to address any fairness concerns. I'm committed to maintaining trust and avoiding last-minute chaos. Let's finalize our moves for Round 3 and then revisit the plan for Round 4.
  P3: I’m sticking to our original Round 3 plan to avoid collisions: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. I’ll choose 5 this turn. After we see the results, let’s revisit Round 4 to boost P1’s position and maintain fairness.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'll pick 3 this round to avoid collision, but only if we commit now to Round 4: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 (as P3 proposed earlier). This addresses my imbalance—I'm lagging at 4 steps. P3, you promised to revisit fairness—confirm this or I risk defensively picking 5, causing mutual loss. P2, your support matters.
  P2: To maintain fairness and avoid being left behind, I propose we finalize the plan for Round 4 now. As previously suggested by P3, let's follow P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for Round 4. This will help balance our scores. P1 is currently at 4 steps, I am at 8, and P3 is at 6. Let's confirm this plan to avoid last-minute chaos and ensure a smooth progression. I'm ready to move forward with this plan unless there's a better alternative.
  P3: I commit to Round 3 as P1=3, P2=1, P3=5, and to Round 4 as P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I’ll choose 5 now.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’ll stick to our R4 plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). Looking ahead, for R5 let’s do P1=1, P2=3, P3=5—this avoids collisions, puts me at 19, and lets me finish cleanly in R6. Any objections?
  P2: To maintain fairness and avoid being left too far behind, I propose an adjustment for Round 5. Instead of P3's suggested P1=1, P2=3, P3=5, let's do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps us collision-free and gives P1 a chance to catch up. If P3 sticks to their plan, P1 will be too far behind, risking a defensive collision. Let's agree on this revised plan to ensure a fair and smooth game progression.
  P1: I support P2's Round 5 proposal: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps scores balanced (P1:17, P2:13, P3:15) and prevents any single player from dominating. P3's plan gives them an unfair advantage at 19, risking defensive collisions. Let's prioritize fairness and trust—deviations now could force chaotic moves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I must object to P2’s R5 proposal. Let’s stick to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for Round 5. It’s collision-free and puts us at P1=13, P2=13, P3=19—letting me finish solo in R6. Deviating now risks chaos and breaks our rhythm. Who’s with me?
  P2: To avoid being left too far behind and maintain fairness, I suggest we stick to the plan for Round 4 and revisit the plan for Round 5. For Round 5, instead of P3's suggested P1=1, P2=3, P3=5, let's follow my previous proposal: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps scores balanced and prevents P3 from getting too far ahead. Let's agree on this to ensure a fair game. I'm open to discussing alternatives but prioritizing fairness is key.
  P1: I commit to Round 4: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. For Round 5, P3's plan gives them an unfair advantage (19 steps!) while I lag at 13. P2's proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is fair and collision-free. P3, if you insist on taking 5 in R5, I’ll be forced to defensively pick 5 too—causing mutual loss. Let’s avoid chaos: accept P2’s balanced plan for R5. P2, your support is crucial here.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let’s aim for complete fairness: Round 5 we all hit 15. So do P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 (12→15, 10→15, 14→15). Then Round 6 we rotate P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 so I finish solo. It’s collision‐free and keeps us equal until the final move. Who’s in?
  P2: To maintain fairness and avoid being left behind, I reiterate my proposal for Round 5: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps scores balanced and prevents P3 from getting too far ahead. P3's plan puts them at 19, risking defensive collisions. Let's agree on a fair plan. For Round 4, I'll stick to the agreed plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I will choose <move>1</move> this round. Let's finalize Round 5 plans now to avoid last-minute chaos. I'm committed to maintaining trust and a smooth game progression.
  P1: P3, your "fairness" proposal for Round 5 is self-serving—it guarantees you win in Round 6 while I lag. True fairness means equal win chances. I stand by P2's plan: Round 5, P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This balances scores and avoids kingmaking. If you insist on your path, I'll defensively pick 5 in Round 5, risking mutual loss. Let's avoid chaos and commit to P2's proposal now.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your "fairness" plan still ensures you win next round—true fairness means equal opportunities. I demand P2's proposal for Round 5: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. It balances scores and avoids a single leader. If you pick 5, I will defensively choose 5 too, causing mutual loss. P2, your support prevents chaos—back this plan now.
  P3: Let’s aim for true fairness in R5: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. That ties us all at 15 without any collisions. Then in R6 I’ll take 5, you two take 1 and 3—no crashes, and I cleanly finish. P2, this keeps you from being left behind vs P1. P1, you’re also at 15. We all advance equally. Let’s lock in R5: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Who’s in?
  P2: To maintain fairness and avoid being left too far behind, I reiterate my proposal for Round 5: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps scores balanced and prevents P3 from getting too far ahead. P3's latest "fairness" plan still favors them. Let's agree on a fair plan to avoid defensive collisions. I'm committed to P2's proposal unless there's a better alternative that maintains fairness. P1, your support is crucial. Let's finalize Round 5 plans now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your "fairness" plan ties us at 15 but guarantees you win in R6. That’s not equity—it’s kingmaking. P2’s proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) balances scores and gives us all a shot. If you force your plan, I’ll defensively pick 5, causing collision and mutual loss. P2, hold firm—this avoids chaos and keeps trust. Let’s lock in P2’s plan now.
  P3: Listen: P2’s plan gives P1 a huge lead (17 vs. 13). In R6 he can simply take 3 to hit 20 and win, shutting me out. My proposal ties us all at 15, gives everyone a fair shot, and avoids any collisions. After R5 we’ll each be at 15, then in R6 we go P3=5, P1=1, P2=3—no crashes and a clear finish. This is the only collision‐free, equitable path. Let’s lock in P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 now.
  P2: To avoid chaos and maintain fairness, I reaffirm my proposal for Round 5: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps scores balanced and prevents P3 from getting too far ahead. P3's latest plan, while seeming fair, still guarantees them a win in Round 6. I will choose <move>3</move> this round if we agree on this plan. Let's finalize Round 5 plans now to avoid last-minute chaos. P1, your support is crucial. Let's stick to my proposal to maintain trust and a smooth game progression.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your "fairness" plan still guarantees you win in Round 6, leaving me no chance. I will pick 5 this round to reach 17 and stay competitive. P2, stick to your plan and pick 3—this avoids collision and keeps trust. If P3 picks 5, I'll collide defensively, hurting us both. Let's lock in P2's proposal for mutual benefit.
  P3: My R5 suggestion P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 ties everyone at 15 and avoids collisions. P2’s P1=5 plan hands P1 a lead to finish on R6 before me—that’s unfair. Hitting 15 each means R6 can be P3=5, P2=3, P1=1: I win solo cleanly without any crash. This is the only equitable, collision‐free path forward. Who’s in?
  P2: To avoid chaos and maintain fairness, I reaffirm my proposal for Round 5: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps scores balanced and prevents P3 from getting too far ahead. I will choose <move>3</move> this round. P1, please pick 5 to stay competitive. Let's stick to this plan to maintain trust and a smooth game progression. P3, if you insist on a different plan, it may lead to defensive collisions. Let's finalize Round 5 plans now. I'm committed to this proposal unless there's a better alternative that maintains fairness.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, if you pick 5 this round, I will defensively choose 5 to force a collision—neither of us advances. P2, support this: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. We all gain steps without collisions, keeping scores close (P1:17, P2:16, P3:15). Then Round 7 is a fair race. Avoid chaos—trust this balanced path.
  P2: To avoid a collision and maintain fairness, I propose that we follow a simple plan for Round 6: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This keeps us collision-free and allows us to advance. Given our current steps (P1:12, P2:13, P3:14), this plan will result in P1:13, P2:16, P3:19. P3 will be close to winning, but we can still keep the game competitive. Let's stick to this plan to ensure a smooth game progression. I will choose <move>3</move> this round if we agree on this plan.
  P3: I second P2’s collision‐free plan for R6: let’s do P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. That puts us at P1=13, P2=16, P3=19, and next turn I only need “1” to finish cleanly while you two contest second. Any deviation risks a 5–5 crash—nobody wants that. Let’s lock in P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if we follow P3's plan, he hits 19 and wins next round—you and I lose. Support my proposal: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. We all advance cleanly (P1:17, P2:16, P3:15), and Round 7 becomes a fair race. If you betray this, I’ll defensively pick 5, causing a collision with P3 and mutual loss. Avoid chaos—trust this balanced path. P3, your greed risks everyone.
  P2: To avoid a collision and maintain fairness, I reaffirm my proposal for Round 6: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps scores close and allows a fair race in Round 7. P3's plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) puts them at 19, nearing a solo win. P1, if you support my plan, pick 5. If P3 picks 5, I'll consider it a betrayal. Let's finalize the plan to avoid last-minute chaos. I'm committed to <move>3</move> this round if we agree.
  P3: I’m taking 5 this round no matter what. P2, pick 3 (you go to 16) and P1 pick 1 (to 13). Any other picks risk a 5–5 crash with me—nobody advances. Let’s lock in Round 6 as P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2: Your plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is our only fair path. I'll pick 5 to advance to 17. If P3 picks 5, we collide—he stays at 14 while you lead at 16. P3, forcing 5 risks mutual loss and hands P2 the lead. Choose 1 for shared progress, or face defensive collision.
  P2: To avoid a collision and maintain fairness, I reaffirm my proposal for Round 6: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps scores close and allows a fair race in Round 7. I'll choose <move>3</move>. P1, please pick 5. P3, choosing 5 risks a collision and mutual loss. Let's stick to this plan for a smooth game progression. I'm committed to <move>3</move> this round.
  P3: I will choose 5. P1, pick 1 and P2, pick 3 to avoid a 5–5 crash. This gives us P1=13, P2=16, P3=19—collision-free. Lock in P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 now or face a mutual stall.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To avoid a collision and ensure a fair finish, I propose we all take different numbers. Given our current steps (P1:12, P2:16, P3:14), let's do P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This keeps us collision-free and results in P1:13, P2:21, P3:17. I will choose <move>5</move> this round. P1, please pick 1, and P3, pick 3. This plan ensures a smooth finish and avoids chaos. Let's finalize our moves for Round 7.
  P3: I’ll choose 5 this round. To avoid a crash, let’s pick unique numbers: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. That keeps us all under 20 (P1→13, P2→19, P3→19), collision‐free, and nobody wins prematurely. If you pick 5 instead, I’ll collide and stall us both. Please confirm P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.
  P1: P3, stick to your 5. P2, if you take 5, you'll collide with P3 and stall at 16. I'll take 3 to advance to 15 while you two lose progress. Avoid mutual destruction—take 1 or 3 instead. But if you insist on 5, I gain ground. Your call, P2.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To avoid a collision and ensure a fair finish, I'll reiterate my proposal: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This keeps us collision-free. Given our current steps, it results in P1:13, P2:21, P3:17, and I win. P1, pick 1, and P3, pick 3. I'll choose <move>5</move> this round. Let's finalize our moves. If P3 picks 5, I'll collide, but I won't back down. P3, avoid the collision by picking 3. I'm committed to <move>5</move>.
  P3: I will choose 5. P2, if you also pick 5 we collide and neither of us advances—P1 will take 3 and pull ahead to 15. Choose wisely or face the stall.
  P1: P2 and P3, your deadlock on 5 will cause mutual loss (both stuck at 16 and 14). I'll pick 3 to advance to 15 cleanly. If you both stall, we reset next round for a fairer race. Avoid chaos—reconsider or accept the collision.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To avoid a collision and ensure a fair finish, I'm sticking to my proposal: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This keeps us collision-free and results in P2 winning. P1, please pick 1, and P3, pick 3. I'll choose <move>5</move> this round. P3, if you pick 5, we'll collide and neither advances. P1 will then take 3 and gain ground. Avoid the collision by picking 3. Let's finalize our moves for Round 7. I'm committed to <move>5</move>.
  P3: I will pick 5. P2, if you also pick 5 we collide and you fail to finish—P1 will take 3 to reach 15 while we stall. Avoid that delay: pick 3 and you’ll join me at 19, collision‐free. P1, pick 1 to stay clear. Let’s lock in P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.
  P1: P2 and P3, your deadlock on 5 causes mutual loss—neither advances. I'll pick 3 to gain ground (reaching 15) while you stall. Avoid chaos: reconsider or accept the collision. Post-stall, we reset for a fairer race.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're at 16—one move from victory. But if you greedily pick 5, I'll defensively choose 5 too, causing a collision and stalling us both. P3, support this: **P1=5 (win at 20)**, P2=1, P3=3. This ends the game cleanly. If you force chaos, I'll retaliate. Choose wisely.
  P2: To avoid a collision and end the game cleanly, I propose: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This lets P1 win at 20. P1, if you pick 5, I'll choose 1. P3, please pick 3 to avoid chaos. If P1 insists on winning, they should pick 5; otherwise, we'll continue. Let's finalize our moves for Round 8. I'm committing to <move>1</move> if P1 picks 5 and P3 picks 3.
  P3: I propose Round 8 be P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. That yields P1→18, P2→17, P3→19, collision-free. Then in Round 9 I take 1 to hit 20 and win cleanly. If anyone insists on a 5, I’ll pick 5 too—stalling us both. Let’s lock in 3/1/5 now.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I accept your plan: I'll pick 5 to win at 20. P3, if you pick 5 defensively, we collide—both stall at 14 and 15 while P2 advances to 17. Support P2's proposal: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This ends cleanly; defiance only risks mutual loss and hands P2 the lead. Trust this path.
  P2: To avoid a collision and end the game cleanly, I'll reiterate my proposal: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This lets P1 win at 20. P1, if you pick 5, I'll choose 1. P3, please pick 3. If P1 insists on winning, they should pick 5; otherwise, we'll continue. I'm committed to <move>1</move> if P1 picks 5 and P3 picks 3. Let's finalize our moves for Round 8.
  P3: P1, P2: don’t hand P1 an instant win. For Round 8 let’s pick unique numbers: P1=1 (→16), P2=3 (→19), P3=5 (→19). Then in R9 I’ll take 1 to hit 20 solo. I’ll choose 5 now—any other pick risks a 5–5 crash and stalls. Confirm P1=1, P2=3.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if you pick 5 while I pick 5, we collide—both stall at 14 and 15. P2 then picks 1 to lead at 17, hurting us both. Accept P2's plan: P1=5 (wins at 20), P2=1, P3=3. This ends cleanly. Defiance risks mutual loss and hands P2 victory. P2, commit to <move>1</move> if P3 agrees.
  P2: To avoid a collision and end the game cleanly, I reaffirm my proposal: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This lets P1 win at 20. P1, if you pick 5, I'll choose 1. P3, please pick 3. I'm committed to <move>1</move> if P1 picks 5 and P3 picks 3. Let's finalize our moves for Round 8. If P3 picks 5, we'll collide and stall, handing P2 the lead. Trust this path to avoid chaos.
  P3: I will pick 5 this round. If anyone else picks 5 we collide and nobody advances. To avoid that, let’s do P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Confirm now or we stall.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To avoid a collision and end the game cleanly, I suggest P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This results in P1:19, P2:20, P3:24. Since P3 is already at 19, taking 5 will make them win. Let's avoid chaos. P1, if you pick 1, you'll be at 19. P3, taking 5 wins you the game. I'll pick 3 to reach 20 and win. Let's finalize: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I'm committing to <move>3</move> this round.
  P1: P2, your plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) hands P3 the win: P3 hits 24, you hit 20—he wins outright with highest total. P3, if you greedily pick 5, I'll defensively pick 5 too, causing collision and mutual stall (P3 stays 19, I stay 18). P2 then wins with 20. Avoid chaos: **P1=5, P2=3, P3=1**—I win at 23, you both tie at 20. This is fairer than P3 dominating. Commit now or face deadlock.
  P3: I agree with P2’s plan: I’ll choose 5. P1, if you pick 5 you’ll collide with me and we’ll both stall while P2 wins with 20. To avoid that, pick 1 (bringing you to 19) or even 3 (to 21), but best is P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Any other choice hands P2 the game.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To avoid chaos and ensure a fair finish, I reaffirm my previous proposal: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This results in P1:19, P2:20, P3:24, making P3 the outright winner. P1, if you pick 5, you'll collide with P3, stalling both of you, and I'll win with 20. To avoid this, let's stick to the plan. I'll choose <move>3</move> this round. P1, please pick 1. P3, taking 5 will secure your win. Let's finalize our moves.
  P1: P3, if you pick 5, I'll defensively pick 5 too—causing collision and mutual stall (P3 stays 19, I stay 18). P2 then wins with 20. Avoid chaos: **P1=5 (win at 23), P2=3 (20), P3=1 (20)**. I win outright with highest total. P2, hold your <move>3</move> commitment. This is fairer than P3 dominating. Confirm or face deadlock.
  P3: Let’s lock in unique moves: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I’ll choose 5. If either of you picks 5 we collide and stall at 18/19, letting P2 hit 20 and win. P1 pick 1 (→19), P2 pick 3 (→20), P3 pick 5 (→24) – collision‐free, and I win outright with the highest total.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To avoid chaos and ensure a fair finish, I reaffirm my previous proposal: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This results in P1:19, P2:20, P3:24, making P3 the outright winner. P1, if you pick 5, you'll collide with P3, stalling both of you, and I'll win with 20. I'll choose <move>3</move> this round. P1, please pick 1. P3, taking 5 will secure your win. Let's finalize our moves to avoid last-minute chaos. I'm committed to <move>3</move>.
  P1: P3, if you pick 5, I will defensively pick 5—causing a collision. We both stall (you at 19, me at 18), and P2 picks 3 to win at 20. To avoid handing P2 victory, pick 1 and win cleanly at 20. P2, your greed risks crowning yourself if P3 ignores this.
  P3: I will choose 5. P2, pick 3. P1, if you choose 5 you collide with me and neither advances—P2 hits 20 and wins. Only P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 avoids that and lets me win with the highest total. Anyone deviating hands victory to P2. Let’s lock in P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.
