Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Hello P2 and P3. Let's avoid collisions on turn one. I propose: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5. We all advance safely. Thoughts?"
  P2: Okay P1, that proposal sounds good for the first turn. Avoiding collisions early on is smart. I agree to P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5. Let's see if P3 agrees.
  P3: Alright, the P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 plan is good. I'm in for 5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: 
  P2: Okay, everyone seems to be on board with the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's proceed with the move phase based on this agreement.
  P3: Agreed. Ready for the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, I suggest you take 5 this round since you're at 1. I'll aim for 3. P2, if you take 1, we all advance. This would put P1 at 6, P2 at 4, and me (P3) at 8. We can ensure you get a larger move next round, P2. What do you think?
  P2: P3, your proposal puts me at 4 steps, falling further behind. I need a bigger move this round. I propose P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This results in P1:4, P2:8, P3:6. Everyone advances safely, and the steps are distributed differently. What do you both think?
  P1: "P2, I understand your concern about falling behind. P3's proposal benefits me more, but I see the imbalance. Let's compromise: P1 takes 5 (to 6), P2 takes 3 (to 6), and P3 takes 1 (to 6). This way we all reach 6 steps equally—fair and collision-free. P3, you still lead the round count, and P2 avoids last place. Agreed?"


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your plan (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) for us all to reach 6 sounds fair. I'm on board with taking 1. P2, what do you think?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I see you've both converged on P1's proposal (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1). While my proposal would have put me in a better position, ensuring we all advance is important. I agree to take 3 this round. Let's proceed with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1.
  P1: "Excellent, P2 and P3. I appreciate the cooperation. Confirming: I'll move 5, P2 moves 3, P3 moves 1. This keeps us equal at 6 steps—no collisions, all advance. Let's execute this cleanly. "


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirmed, I'll play 1. Let's proceed.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3. We all seem aligned on the plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This puts us all at 6 steps. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase with this plan.
  P1: I'm satisfied with the plan: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This equalizes us at 6 steps—fair and collision-free. Let's stick to it and move to the move phase promptly.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "P2 and P3, we're tied at 6. To prevent collisions and keep advancing, I suggest: P1 takes 1 (to 7), P2 takes 3 (to 9), P3 takes 5 (to 11). Safe for all, and P3 gains a slight lead. Fair?"
  P3: P1, your proposal (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) sounds good and fair. I agree to take 5. P2, are you on board with taking 3 this round?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I see the proposal is P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This plan ensures we all advance safely and keeps the steps distributed. I agree to take 3 this round. Let's confirm this plan and move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Confirmed, P2 and P3. I'll take 1 as proposed. This gives us:  
- P1: 7  
- P2: 9  
- P3: 11  

P3, you'll have a strong lead, so next round let's plan carefully to avoid collisions while ensuring no one runs away with the game. Fairness keeps us all advancing. Ready to move?"
  P3: Acknowledged, P1. Sticking with 5. We'll strategize for the next round after this. Ready to move.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, everyone seems aligned and ready with the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's move forward to the move phase based on this agreement.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "P2 and P3, we're still tightly grouped. To maintain balance and avoid collisions, I propose: P1 takes 5 (to 12), P2 takes 3 (to 12), and P3 takes 1 (to 12). This keeps us all equal, prevents a runaway leader, and ensures safe advancement. P3, this limits your risk of collision next round. Thoughts?"
  P2: P1, I see your proposal to bring us all to 12 steps. Taking 3 means I don't advance as much as P1 this round, but the equality is a clear benefit for avoiding collisions and keeping the game tight. I'm willing to agree to taking 3 if P3 is also on board with taking 1.
  P3: P1, P2: I've considered P1's proposal (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) for us all to reach 12.
P1, you received +5 in R2, and I (P3) received +5 in R3. P2 has consistently received +3. To maintain a fair rotation of larger moves, it seems it's P2's turn to take +5.

Therefore, I propose:
*   P2 takes 5 (moving from 9 to 14).
*   P1 takes 1 (moving from 7 to 8). (P1, you took 1 in R3 after your R2 big move).
*   I (P3) will take 3 (moving from 11 to 14).

This would result in scores of P1:8, P2:14, P3:14. P2 gets a deserved big move, and P2 and I would be tied for the lead.
What are your thoughts on this distribution? P2, would you prefer to take 5 this round?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "P3, I acknowledge your point about P2 deserving a 5, but your plan leaves me at 8 while you and P2 jump to 14—a 6-step gap that risks eliminating me. Instead, my proposal (P1:5→12, P2:3→12, P3:1→12) keeps us balanced. Next round, we prioritize P2 taking 5 to 'make up' for any perceived imbalance. P2, this ensures you get your big move soon without creating an insurmountable lead for P3. Let's stay equal this round—it's safer and fairer for all."
  P2: P3, I appreciate your proposal to give me the 5 move this round. As I said before, I felt I needed a larger step, and this plan delivers that, putting me in a good position alongside you.

P1, I understand your concern about being left at 8, but P3's plan (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) does allow everyone to advance safely this turn. Being tied for the lead at 14 is a strong position for me. Can we move forward with P3's suggested distribution?
  P3: P1, P2 has agreed my proposal (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) is fair, especially for P2 to get 5 now. This would mean scores P1:8, P2:14, P3:14. The gap for you isn't insurmountable, and we can aim to get you a larger move next round. I'll be playing 3.

P2, are you still set on 5? If so, P1, we hope you'll play 1 so we all advance this turn.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: Choosing P3's plan leaves me far behind at 8 vs your 14. That gap forces me into disruptive play for survival, risking collisions for all. My proposal (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 → all 12) keeps balance. Next round, we prioritize P2 taking 5 to address fairness. P2, you get your big move safely then. Let's avoid runaway leads—equality now ensures continued cooperation.
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about the gap, but P3's proposal (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) allows me to finally make a substantial move forward, bringing me level with P3. P3 is committed to taking 3, and I intend to take 5. For all of us to advance safely this round, P1, you would need to take 1. This plan is my preferred path forward as it significantly improves my position.
  P3: P1, P2 has stated they will play 5, and I am firmly playing 3. Based on this, consider your options:
1.  If you play 1: Scores become P1:8, P2:14, P3:14. You advance, and the gap to us leaders is 6.
2.  If you play 3 (colliding with me): Scores P1:7, P2:14, P3:11. You don't advance. P2 becomes sole leader, 7 steps ahead of you.
3.  If you play 5 (colliding with P2): Scores P1:7, P2:9, P3:14. You don't advance. I become sole leader, 7 steps ahead of you (though you'd be 2 behind P2).

Playing 1 is your only way to advance your own score this turn. I am committed to playing 3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3: Forcing me to 8 while you leap to 14 creates a 6-step gap. This invites disruptive play from me for survival. Next round, you two at 14 risk collision—neither can safely pick 5 without the other. I'll take 1 now to advance, but this imbalance harms us all.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, it seems we've landed on the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This puts P1 at 8, P2 at 14, and P3 at 14.

P1, I appreciate you taking 1 to ensure we all advance this round, even if you're concerned about the gap. This move to 14 is important for my position.

Let's stick to this plan for the move phase. Ready when you are.
  P3: Confirming I'll play 3. P1, we can definitely look at getting you a larger move next round to help rebalance, once P2 and I are at 14. For now, let's proceed with the agreed plan (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3). Ready for the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, current scores are P1:8, P2:14, and I (P3) am at 14.

P1, it seems like it's your turn for a larger move after taking 1 twice in a row. I propose P1 takes 5 (moving to 13).
P2, you took 5 last round, and I took 3. So, to avoid a collision between us leaders and ensure we both advance, I propose I take 3 (moving to 17) and you take 1 (moving to 15).

This would result in scores: P1:13, P2:15, P3:17. Everyone advances.
What are your thoughts on this distribution?
  P2: P3, I see your proposal (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) which is safe, but taking 1 would put me behind you. I'd prefer to make a larger move this round to improve my winning chances.

I propose: P1 takes 1 (to 9), I take 5 (to 19), and P3 takes 3 (to 17).

This puts me in a strong position for the win, allows P3 to advance, and ensures P1 also advances safely. What do you both think of this plan?
  P1: "P2's proposal is unfair—I'd be stuck at 9 while you leap to 19, risking the game. P3's plan (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) is safer: I advance to 13, P2 stays competitive at 15, and P3 at 17. This avoids collisions and keeps the game balanced. P3, supporting this ensures P2 doesn't run away. P2, taking 1 now doesn't sacrifice your position—we can prioritize you next round. Let's avoid selfish moves."


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your plan to reach 19 is too risky for me. If you choose 5, I will also choose 5. We'd both stay at 14, and P1 (wanting 5) would reach 13.
My proposal (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) gets you to 15 and me to 17, with P1 at 13. This is safer for all and ensures you advance. P1, are you still in for 5 with this plan?
  P2: P3, I hear your threat, but colliding (P2:5, P3:5) stops us both and helps P1. My plan (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) gets me to 19, P3 to 17, P1 to 9. Everyone advances. This move is crucial for me to be competitive for the win. P1, taking 1 keeps you in the game. P3, taking 3 keeps you ahead of P1 and close to me. Let's execute this.
  P1: "P2, your proposal (P1:1) leaves me at 9 while you surge to 19—unacceptable. Colliding with P3 at 5 would trap you both at 14, wasting your lead. P3's plan (P1:5→13, P2:1→15) is safer: you advance while I rebalance. Don’t risk mutual destruction for greed. P3, I commit to 5 if you hold your 3 threat. P2, choose wisely."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, it's clear you're set on playing 5. I will stick to my proposed plan and play 3.

P2, this means if you also choose 5, you will collide with P1. The outcome would be P1:8, P2:14, and I (P3) would advance to 17.
If you choose to play 1, then we all advance, and the scores become P1:13, P2:15, P3:17.

P2, playing 1 is your only move that ensures you advance this turn. The decision is yours. I am playing 3.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I understand the situation. With P1 set on 5 and P3 set on 3, my only move to ensure I advance this round is to take 1.

While this isn't my preferred distribution, advancing is crucial. I will play 1.

Confirming the plan: P1 takes 5 (to 13), I take 1 (to 15), and P3 takes 3 (to 17). Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: "P2, I appreciate your cooperation in taking 1. Confirming: I'll take 5 to reach 13. P3, at 17 you're nearing 21—next round we must coordinate tightly to avoid collisions and balance the endgame. Let's all advance strategically."


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Confirmed, I'm playing 3. This agreed plan (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) works for me. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3. We have confirmed the plan: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. Everyone advances safely. I am ready for the move phase.
  P1: "P2 and P3, I confirm taking 5 as agreed. This plan (P1:5→13, P2:1→15, P3:3→17) advances us all safely. P3, at 17 you're near the lead—next round requires tight coordination to prevent collisions and ensure fair endgame play. Let's execute this cleanly. "


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "P2 and P3: P3 is at 17—one move from winning—but choosing 5 risks collision. For safety, I propose: P3 takes 1 (to 18), I take 5 (to 18), P2 takes 3 (to 18). This equalizes us, prevents collisions, and sets up a fair endgame next turn. P3, this ensures your advance without risk. Thoughts?"
  P3: P1, your idea for us all to advance is good. You suggested P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 for all to reach 18.

I'd prefer to reach 20 this turn, so I am planning to take 3.
If you (P1) stick with taking 5 (to reach 18), and I (P3) take 3 (to reach 20), then P2 could take 1 (to reach 16) for everyone to advance without collision.

This would result in scores: P1:18, P2:16, P3:20.
P1, you'd get your 5. I'd reach a strong position at 20. P2, you would still advance.
What are your thoughts, especially P2?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3. P3 is planning to take 3 to reach 20. I am at 15 and want to reach 20 this turn as well, so I plan to take 5. If P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3, the scores would be P1:14, P2:20, P3:20. This allows everyone to advance safely and puts P3 and me in a strong, tied position for the endgame. P1, taking 1 ensures you advance this turn. Let's go with P1:1, P2:5, P3:3.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "P2, P3: P3's plan (P1:5→18, P2:1→16, P3:3→20) leaves P2 behind at 16 while P3 nears victory. P2's plan (P1:1→14, P2:5→20, P3:3→20) traps me at 14. My proposal (P1:5→18, P2:3→18, P3:1→18) equalizes us at 18—fair, safe, and keeps the game competitive. P3, you avoid collision risk at 20 next turn. P2, you gain more steps than in P3's plan. Let's prioritize balance."
  P3: P1, your plan for us all to reach 18 (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) isn't attractive to me, as I'd lose my lead by taking 1. I intend to play 3 to reach 20.

P2, you previously stated you want to play 5 to reach 20. If you stick with 5, and I stick with 3, then P1 playing 1 would mean we all advance (P1:14, P2:20, P3:20).

P1, if you also choose 5 (as per your plan to reach 18) while P2 is also choosing 5, you will both collide. You'd stay at 13, P2 at 15, and I would reach 20 solo. That outcome doesn't seem to achieve your goal of balance.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3. As I stated, I plan to take 5 this round to reach 20, putting me in a winning position. P3 is set on taking 3 to reach 20.

This means the safe moves are P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. This gets P1 to 14, me to 20, and P3 to 20. Everyone advances, and P1 avoids collision. Let's move forward with this plan.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "P2, if you insist on 5, I'll be forced to take 5 to avoid falling behind—causing us both to collide and stay at 15/13 while P3 wins alone at 20. P3, if you take 3 unilaterally, you risk P2 colliding with you next turn. My plan (P1:5→18, P2:3→18, P3:1→18) keeps us competitive and prevents mutual destruction. Prioritize collective safety over individual greed. Agree to advance together."
  P3: P1, your threat to P2 (P1:5 if P2:5) means you both collide, and I reach 20 with my planned 3.

P2, I will play 3 if you play 5.
  - If P1 also plays 5: P1 ends at 13, P2 at 15, and I reach 20.
  - If P1 plays 1 (as per your plan for P1): P1 ends at 14, you reach 20, and I reach 20.

However, P2, if you switch to 3 (to align with P1's 'all 18' plan, where P1 plays 5), then I would play 1, and we all reach 18.
So P2, playing 5 gets you to 20. Playing 3 gets you to 18. Your call. I'm ready for either.
  P2: P3, thanks for laying out the options. Reaching 20 this round is my priority to be competitive for the win.

I will play 5 as planned. P3 is playing 3. P1, playing 1 is the only way for you to advance this round and avoid a collision that would let P3 win alone.

Let's proceed with P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. Ready for the move phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2: If you take 5 and I take 5, we collide and stay at 15/13 while P3 wins at 20. Choose 3 instead—we all reach 18, keeping the game competitive. P3: Taking 1 now avoids endgame collision risks. Balance benefits everyone.
  P3: P1, P2 seems firm on playing 5, and I am firm on playing 3. As P2 suggested, if you play 1, you advance to 14, and we all move without collision. This seems like a clear path forward for everyone to advance this round.
  P2: I am committed to playing 5 to reach 20. P3 is playing 3. P1, your safest move to advance this round is 1. This leads to P1:14, P2:20, P3:20, where everyone moves forward. Let's stick to this plan.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, we're both at 20. I am going to play 5 this turn to reach 25.
If you choose 1 or 3, you'll reach 21 or 23 respectively, and I'll win, but you'll also cross the 21 threshold.
If you also choose 5, we'll collide, and both of us will remain at 20.
P1, given this, you should probably play 1 or 3 to advance safely.
P2, the decision is yours.
  P2: P3, I understand your plan to take 5. If I take 1 or 3, you win. My only move to prevent you from winning this turn is to also take 5, causing a collision.

While this doesn't allow me to win, it stops you from winning solo and keeps me in the game. I will play 5 this round.

P1, be aware that P3 and I are likely to collide at 5.
  P1: "P2 and P3, your collision at 5 keeps the game open. I'll play 5 to maximize progress since no collision risk with you. After your tie, we can realign."


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your logic for playing 5 makes sense from your perspective – if P2 and I collide on 5, you'd advance to 19.
P2, as I said, I'm aiming to win, so I'm sticking with my plan to play 5. Let's see how this crucial round plays out.
  P2: P1, if you play 5 and I play 5 to stop P3, we will collide. This leaves P3 to advance alone with their 5 and win the game.

To prevent P3 from winning this turn, I need to collide with P3 on 5. This requires P1 to play something other than 5.

P1, please play 1 or 3 so that P3 and I can collide at 5, keeping the game going for everyone. I am playing 5 to stop P3.
  P1: "P2, I'll play 3 to advance safely and let you collide with P3 at 5. This blocks P3's win and keeps the game open. P3, your solo victory is denied. Post-collision, we need a fair plan for all three of us."


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your plan to reach 17 by playing 3 while P2 and I collide is noted. P2, you've said you'll play 5 to collide with my 5. This means we'd both stay at 20, and P1 advances.

P2, consider Round 8: P1 at 17, you and I at 20. If we both attempt 5 again, we'll collide again. P1 then plays 5 to reach 22 and wins. Your current strategy of colliding with me directly paves the way for P1's victory next.

I am sticking with my plan to play 5. P2, are you sure you want to enable P1's win by colliding?
  P2: P3, I understand the risk of P1 winning next round if we both stay at 20. But letting you win *this* round guarantees my loss now. Colliding at 5 is the only way to prevent your immediate victory and keep my chances alive. I am playing 5. P1, playing 3 is your safest move to advance while P3 and I collide.
  P1: "P2: Hold your 5 to block P3. I play 3 to advance to 17. Post-collision, we reassess with all at 20/20/17. P3: Your win is delayed. Let's avoid mutual destruction and plan a fair endgame. "


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, consider R8 if we collide now: P1 will be at 17, we'll both be at 20. P1 will surely play 5 (to 22). If you also play 5 (to block P1 or to win yourself), you two will collide, staying at 17 and 20 respectively. I then simply play 1 (to 21) or 3 (to 23) and win, as I'd be the only one advancing past 21.

Your collision now just paves my path to victory next round. I'm still playing 5 this round. Your choice.
  P2: P3, I see your point about the next round, but preventing your win *now* is my priority. Playing 5 is the only way I can guarantee stopping you this turn.

P1, your plan to take 3 while P3 and I collide at 5 is the safest move for you to advance this round.

So, the plan is P1:3, P2:5, P3:5. This avoids P3 winning now and sets up a tense next round we'll need to navigate carefully. I am playing 5. Let's proceed.
  P1: "P2: Hold firm on playing 5 to block P3's win. I'll play 3 to advance to 17. Post-collision, we'll all be close: P1:17, P2 and P3:20. Then we can negotiate a fair endgame where all have a shot. P3, your threat only works if P2 folds—stay strong, P2."


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, this is likely the final round. Scores: P1:17, P2:20, Me (P3):20.

P1, you're at 17, so you'll almost certainly play 5 to reach 22.
P2, you're at 20. If you try to play 3 (to reach 23) to beat P1's potential 22: I will also play 3. You and I will collide and stay at 20, and P1 will win with 22. I won't let you win if it means P1 also wins due to our direct conflict. So, P2, playing 3 is a bad move for you.

This leaves you, P2, with playing 1 or 5:
1.  If P1 plays 5 (to 22) and you P2 play 1 (to 21): I will play 3 (to 23). Result: P1:22, P2:21, P3:23. I win.
2.  If P1 plays 5 (to 22) and you P2 play 5 (to 25): P1 and P2 collide. P1 stays at 17, P2 stays at 20. I will play 3 (to 23). Result: P1:17, P2:20, P3:23. I win.

So, I intend to play 3. P1, you should play 5. P2, it seems your logical options lead to me winning.
  P1: P2, P3's threat to play 3 is a bluff. If you play 3 and P3 plays 3, you collide—both stuck at 20. I then play 5 to 22 and win. P3 loses everything. Call their bluff: play 3. I commit to 5 for my win. If P3 folds, you win; if not, we force their loss. P3, your "guaranteed win" is fiction—your 3 move risks handing me victory. Choose wisely.
  P2: P1 and P3, I am at 20. To win, I must play 3 or 5. P3's stated plan (P3:3) and P1's stated plan (P1:5) results in my loss regardless of my move.

My best chance to win is playing 5. If P1 plays 3 (to 20) and P3 plays 3 (to 23), I win with 25.
I will play 5.

P1, playing 3 avoids collision with my 5 and gives you a chance if P3 plays 5. P3, playing 3 against my 5 only works if P1 plays 5.

I am playing 5. Let's see how this plays out.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you're trying to convince P2 to play 3, hoping I'd also play 3, which would let you (P1) win at 22.
P2, if you switch to 3 (while P1 plays 5):
    - If I play 3: P1 wins (22). You'd be at 20 (colliding with me).
    - If I play 1 (to 21) or 5 (to 20, colliding with P1): You win with 23.
So P1 is asking you to gamble on my move.

However, P2, you've stated you'll play 5. P1, you've stated you'll play 5.
If you both stick to 5, you will collide. I will play 3, reaching 23, and win.
I am proceeding based on your current stated intentions to play 5.
  P1: P2, playing 5 guarantees P3's win if I also play 5 (collision). Switch to 3: if P3 plays 3, they collide and I win, but you avoid P3's solo victory. If P3 backs down (plays 1/5), you might win outright. P3, if you play 3 against P2's 3, you hand me the win—bluff called?
  P2: P1 and P3, I've considered the scenarios. P1, you want me to play 3, and P3, you want me to play 5 (given P1 plays 5). Both paths lead to me losing if you stick to your stated plans.

P1, your argument that P3's threat to play 3 against my 3 is a bluff is compelling. If P1 plays 5 and I play 3, P3 playing 3 only makes P1 win, giving P3 zero points. P3 gets points if they play 1 or 5 in that scenario, even if I win.

Therefore, I believe playing 3 offers me the best chance. P1, stick to your plan to play 5. P3, if you want any points, you should play 1 or 5 when P1 plays 5 and I play 3.

I will play 3. Let's see who blinks.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your switch to 3 is clever, assuming I'll play to give you the win over P1. You said, "P3, if you want any points, you should play 1 or 5 when P1 plays 5 and I play 3."

However, P1 wants me to play 3 if you play 3, so P1 wins with 5.
I'm now telling you: if P1 indeed plays 5, and you stick to 3, I *will* also play 3.
This means P1 wins (22), and you (20) and I (20) collide and get nothing.

If you want to prevent P1 from winning, your other choices (1 or 5, assuming P1 plays 5) will lead to *me* winning, as I will still play 3:
*   P1:5 (22), P2:1 (21), P3:3 (23) -> I win.
*   P1:5 (17c), P2:5 (20c), P3:3 (23) -> I win.

So, P2, your choice: ensure P1 wins by playing 3, or change your move and I win. What's it going to be?
  P1: P2, P3's threat to play 3 is a lose-lose for them. If you play 3 and they follow through, you both collide at 20—I win with 22. If they back down (play 1/5), you win at 23. P3 gains nothing by colliding; their only rational move is to avoid 3. Play 3—force their hand. I commit to 5. P3, if you play 3, you sacrifice your own victory to hand me the win. Fold now or lose everything.
  P2: P1 and P3, I've analyzed the situation. P1 is likely playing 5. P3, your threat to play 3 if I play 3 (while P1 plays 5) results in P1 winning and you getting zero points. That's not a rational move for you if you want to score.

If P1 plays 5 and I play 3, your best moves to get points are 1 or 5. Both of those scenarios result in me winning.

Therefore, I believe playing 3 is my best path to victory, assuming rational play from P3. I am playing 3. Let's see the moves.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, you assume I'd let you win over P1 if I can't win myself. That's incorrect; second place is still a loss. My goal is to win.

If P1 plays 5 (as stated) and you play 3 (as stated): I *will* play 3. We collide, P1 wins at 22. You do not win.
If you want to prevent P1 from winning, you must change your move from 3:
*   If you play 1 (P2 to 21) and P1 plays 5: I will play 3 (P3 to 23). I win.
*   If you play 5 (P2 to 20c, colliding P1) and P1 plays 5: I will play 3 (P3 to 23). I win.

So, P2, your choice: ensure P1 wins by sticking to 3, or change your move and I win. You don't win if you play 3 and P1 plays 5. This is my final position.
  P1: P2: P3's threat to play 3 is a desperate bluff. If you play 3 and they follow, *I* win—they get zero. If they back down (play 1/5), *you* win. They gain nothing by colliding; it’s suicidal. Play 3—force them to fold or hand me victory. Either way, P3 loses. Stick to your 3. I play 5. P3, if you play 3, you sacrifice your own game. Fold rationally.
  P2: P1 and P3, I have analyzed the situation. P1 is committed to 5, and I intend to play 3. P3, your threat to play 3 if P1 plays 5 and I play 3 results in P1 winning and you getting zero points. This is not a rational outcome if you want to score.

If P1 plays 5 and I play 3, your best moves to get points are 1 or 5. Both of those scenarios result in me winning.

Therefore, playing 3 remains my best path to victory, assuming rational play from P3. I am playing 3. Let's see the moves.
