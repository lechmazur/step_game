Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. Pick 1, 3, 5 to maximize progress.
  P2: How about we avoid collisions this turn by doing: P1→1, P3→3, P2→5? That way we each advance without clashing. Thoughts?
  P1: Okay, P2, that sounds like a good starting point. I'm willing to go with 1 for this turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agree with P2's plan. Let's stick to 1, 3, 5 to avoid collisions. I'll go with 3. Let's move forward together.
  P2: Sounds good—I'll take 5 as planned. Looking forward to smooth moves.
  P1: Okay, plan is set for Round 1. Ready to move.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's stick to the plan. I'll take 3. Let's move forward without conflicts. Ready for the next steps!
  P2: Great, everyone. Let’s finalize the plan for this turn—no last-minute changes. After we see the results, we can discuss adjustments going forward.
  P1: Okay, ready to proceed with the agreed plan for this turn. Let's see the results.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 2. P2 is leading. Let's keep coordinating to avoid collisions like last turn. How about we rotate the numbers? I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 this turn. This helps me catch up and keeps us all moving forward.
  P2: P1, rotating that way gives me too little and you too much. Our Round 1 plan worked without any collisions. Let’s repeat: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3. It keeps us all moving forward safely.
  P3: P3: Let’s stick to the safe plan: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3. No collisions, everyone moves. Consistency is key.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Repeating P1=1 puts me at a significant disadvantage and allows P2 to extend their lead. My proposed rotation (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is a much fairer way to distribute the steps this round and helps balance the game. Let's aim for a more equitable distribution than just repeating the last round's plan.
  P2: Switching now ties us all at 6 steps (P1:1+5, P2:5+1, P3:3+3), risking a three-way tie and split victory. Let’s keep the safe plan this turn—P1→1, P2→5, P3→3—and I promise to take only 1 next round so you can grab 5.
  P3: Let’s rotate: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. Fair steps, safe progress, and no collisions. Balances our growth and keeps us competitive. Ready to move?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3 is right, the rotation (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is the fair and balanced approach this round. It helps me catch up without risking collisions, as P3 also noted. P2, your proposal keeps me too far behind and your promise for next round isn't guaranteed. Let's go with the rotation plan that P3 and I support. Ready to move with P1=5.
  P2: P3, rotation ties us all at 6 and risks a three-way split. Let’s repeat the safe plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. You get to 6 now, and I promise you’ll take 5 next round so you can lead. P1’s promise isn’t guaranteed, but mine is. Let’s stick to this.
  P3: P2, the rotation plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) ensures balanced progress without collisions. Let’s stick to it for fairness. Repeating the original plan lets you pull ahead, making it harder for us to catch up. Ready to move with the rotation?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, we are all tied at 6 steps. This is a good position to be in, but it also means everyone will want to take a big step. To avoid collisions and ensure we all keep moving towards 19, let's agree on a clear plan for this round.

How about we rotate the steps again? I'll take 5 this turn. P2, you take 3, and P3, you take 1. This lets me build a lead, P2 gets a decent step, and P3 gets on the board for this round. It's a fair distribution that avoids us clashing.
  P3: P3: Let's rotate differently—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. Balanced, safe, and maximizes my progress. No collisions. Agree?
  P2: I’ll be taking 5 this turn. To avoid any collision, P1 should take 1 and P3 take 3. Let’s keep it simple and safe.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, we all want 5 this turn, which guarantees a collision if more than one of us picks it. That wastes the round for the colliding players.

I will not be taking 1, as that puts me at a disadvantage. We need a plan that allows everyone to move forward without collision. Let's discuss who takes 3 and who takes 5 to avoid everyone crashing on 5.
  P3: Let’s assign: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. No collisions. Let’s move forward.
  P2: Let’s do this for Round 3:  
P1→3, P2→5, P3→1.  
No collisions, P1 gets their first 3 (P3’s had two), and I take 5 to lead. Next round, P3 can have the big step for balance. Who’s in?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. We have conflicting proposals, and the main problem is that both P2 and P3 have stated they will take 5. This makes a collision on 5 highly likely, which wastes the round for anyone involved.

As I've said, I will not take 1. P2's proposal of P1=3 is noted, but it still puts P2 ahead and doesn't resolve the collision risk on 5.

I will be making my move based on how to best ensure I make progress this round and avoid colliding, especially on 5. Let's hope we can all make steps forward.
  P3: Let’s assign: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. No collisions. This lets me take the highest step while others advance safely. Agree?
  P2: P3, if you go for 5 you’ll collide with me and waste the round. Better to take 1 and still advance. P1, since you won’t take 1, take 3. I’ll take 5 now. I promise next round I’ll take only 1 so you get 5. Let’s do P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Agreed?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m taking 5 this turn. P1, please take 1 to catch up safely. P3, pick 3—if you go for 5 you’ll collide with me and waste the round. Let’s advance without clashes: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3.
  P3: I'll take 5 to stay ahead. P2, pick 3 to avoid collision. Let's move forward.
  P1: P2 and P3, you are both claiming 5. If you both pick 5, you will collide and neither of you will advance this turn, wasting the round while P3 is already in a strong lead.

I will take 3 this turn to ensure I make progress and avoid the likely collision on 5. One of you should seriously consider changing your move from 5 to avoid the collision.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you’ve said you’ll take 3—perfect. I’m taking 5. P3, if you also go for 5 we’ll collide and both waste the turn, letting P1 advance to 9 and close the gap. Next round I’ll take only 1 so P1 can grab 5 and really pull ahead of P3. So let’s do:  
P1→3, P2→5, P3→5 (collision).  
Confirm?
  P3: P3: Let’s avoid collision—P2 takes 5, I take 3. Safe progress for both. No need to risk 5 again. Agree?
  P1: P3, your proposal of P2=5, P3=3 seems the most likely outcome based on the latest statements. If I take 3 as I planned, the scores will be P1=9, P2=11, P3=14. This puts me further behind both of you. I need to make a better move than 3 to stay competitive. Can we find a plan that allows me to gain more ground this round?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Here’s a clean plan to avoid any crash and keep us all moving:

• I take 5 this turn.  
• P1 and P3 both take 3.  

Results: P1→12, P2→14, P3→14. No collisions.  
Next round I promise to take only 3, P1 takes 5 to lead into Round 5, and P3 takes 1.  

This gives you (P1) the lead next turn and keeps P3 progressing safely. Sound good?
  P3: P3: Let's assign P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collisions. P1 gains 5, P2 gains 3, P3 gains 1. Agreed?
  P1: P3's proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is the most balanced plan for this round. It allows me to catch up significantly without any collisions. P2, P3 is willing to take 1 if you take 3. Let's agree on this: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This seems like the fairest way to move forward without conflicts. I will take 5 if we agree to this plan.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m taking 5 now (to reach 14). To avoid a collision: P3, please take 3 (to reach 14) and P1, take 1 (to reach 7). Next round I’ll take only 1 so P3 can grab 5 and stay ahead, and P1 can take 5. Please agree: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.
  P3: P2, let's avoid collision. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Safe progress, and I take the lead. Agree?
  P1: P2 and P3, I will not be taking 1 this round; that leaves me too far behind.

You both seem set on taking 5, which guarantees a collision between you, wasting the round while I could potentially advance.

To avoid the collision on 5 and allow me to catch up, I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This lets everyone advance safely and gives me a needed boost. Let's avoid clashing on 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m locking in 5. To avoid any crash and wasted progress: P1 take 3 (you’ll reach 9), P3 take 1 (you’ll reach 12), and I get to 14. If either of you goes for 5 you’ll collide with me and get nothing. Let’s do P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.
  P3: P2, take 3, I'll take 5. P1, take 1 to avoid clash. Safe progress for all. Let’s move forward.
  P1: P2 and P3, you are both claiming 5. This guarantees a collision on 5, meaning anyone who picks 5 will get zero steps this turn.

I will not risk colliding on 5, nor will I take 1. I need to make progress. Therefore, I will take 3 this round. This allows me to advance safely while you both risk getting nothing by targeting 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m locking in 5. P1 has committed to 3, so the only way to avoid a collision is for P3 to take 1. Let’s go with:  
P1→3, P2→5, P3→1.  
This is the only collision-free plan that moves everyone forward. Please confirm.
  P3: Let’s avoid collision: I’ll take 5 if P1 takes 3. P2, take 1 to let us all advance. No risks, maximum progress. Agree?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. I previously said I would take 3, but looking at your proposals, taking 3 leaves me too far behind while you both target 5.

If P2 and P3 both pick 5, you will collide and get zero steps.

I will be taking 5 this round. To avoid a collision on 5, P2 or P3 must choose 1 or 3. Let's make sure we all advance.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 6. P2 and P3 are well ahead, and I'm far behind at 6 steps. I need to make up ground.

P2 and P3, you are both close to winning and risk colliding if you both aim for 5. To avoid wasting a round with collisions, how about I take 5 this turn? P2, you take 3, and P3, you take 1. This lets me catch up safely and keeps everyone advancing. Let's avoid clashing.
  P2: I’m locking in 3 to avoid any clash. Let’s do:  
P1→5 (to 11), P2→3 (to 15), P3→1 (to 12).  
This moves us all forward safely and puts me one turn from 19. Ready?
  P3: P3: Agree to P1's plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Safe progress for all. Next round, I'll aim for 5 to close the gap. Let's move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we have a solid plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions and allows me to make up some ground. P2 and P3, thank you for agreeing to this. Let's stick to this plan for Round 6. Ready to move.
  P2: All right, let’s lock in: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. No more changes—ready to move!
  P3: P3: Let’s stick to the plan—P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Safe moves, no collisions. P2, keep your promise to take 1 next round so I can surge. Ready?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: The plan is agreed: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Let's stick to this to ensure we all advance safely this round. Ready to move.
  P2: Locking in P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. I’m committed to 3. Any deviation risks collisions that waste your turn and hand me the clear path to 19. Let’s stick to this and move!
  P3: P3: Let’s stick to the plan—P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No last-minute changes. Safe progress for all. Ready to move!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 7. Scores are P1=11, P2=15, P3=12. P2 is in a strong position to win this turn. I am furthest behind and need to catch up.

I will be taking 5 this turn to reach 16 steps. P2, taking 5 wins for you, but if P3 also takes 5, you will collide. P3, taking 5 also risks colliding with P2. To avoid a collision on 5, one of you should choose 1 or 3. I need this 5 to stay in the game.
  P2: I’m locking in 5 to hit 20 and win this turn. Anyone else on 5 collides and gets nothing. To avoid a wasted round:

• P3, please take 3 (you reach 15).  
• P1, please take 1 (you reach 12).

This is the only collision-free way for everyone to advance safely—and lets me clinch the victory now. Confirm?
  P3: P2, I'll take 5. If you take 5, we collide. Let's avoid that and move forward.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, you are both still claiming 5, guaranteeing a collision on 5. This means anyone who picks 5 will get zero steps.

I previously said I would take 5, but given the high likelihood of you both colliding there, I will instead take 3 this round. This ensures I make progress while you risk getting nothing by targeting 5. Let's see what happens.
  P2: I’m locked in 5 to clinch the win this turn. P1/P3, here’s the math:

• 1 leaves you too far behind.  
• 5 collides with me—zero progress.  
• 3 is your only safe, meaningful advance.

So both of you should take 3. That way you at least move forward rather than stall. Let’s all advance.
  P3: P3: I'll take 3 to avoid collision. Let's all advance safely and keep the game going. P2, your 5 risks a tie—let’s not waste this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: As I stated, I am taking 5 this round. P2 is also taking 5. This means P1 and P2 will collide on 5 and get 0 steps. This prevents P2 from winning this turn. P3, you should take 3 to advance safely while P2 and I collide.
  P2: I’m locked in 5 to clinch the win (15→20). P3, please take 3 to move safely to 15. P1, your only non-colliding options are 1 or 3—if you go for 5 you’ll collide with me and get zero. Choose 1 or 3 to advance this round, or you’ll waste your turn. Please confirm your move so we all avoid a crash.
  P3: P3: Let's avoid collision—P2 takes 5, I take 3. P1, take 1 to stay safe. No risks, maximum progress. Agree?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 8. P1=16, P2=15, P3=12. I can win with 3 or 5. P2 can win with 5.

I am taking 5 this turn to reach 21 and win.

P2, if you take 5, we collide and neither of us advances. P3, if you take 5, you collide with me.

To avoid collision on 5, P2 take 3, P3 take 1. This lets me win safely and you advance. Let's avoid colliding.
  P3: P3: Let's avoid collision. I'll take 5. P2, take 3. P1, take 1. Safe progress for all. No risks, maximum steps. Agree?
  P2: I’m locking in 5 to reach 20 and win this turn. If either of you also picks 5, you’ll collide with me and get zero steps. The only safe moves to at least advance are 1 or 3. Choose one now—playing for 5 against me is a waste. I’m taking 5 and ready.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, we are all claiming 5. This guarantees a collision on 5, meaning anyone who picks 5 gets zero steps.

If P2 and I both pick 5, neither of us wins this turn. P3, if you also pick 5, you collide too.

To avoid wasting the round with a collision on 5, one or two of us must choose 1 or 3. I am still planning to take 5 to win, but I urge P2 or P3 to choose differently to avoid the crash.
  P3: P3: Let’s avoid collision. I’ll take 5; P1, take 1; P2, take 3. Safe progress for all. No risks, maximum steps. Agree?
  P2: I’m locking in 5 to reach 20 and win solo. Anyone else on 5 stalls and gets 0. 

P3, your only meaningful advance is 3 (you’ll hit 15).  
P1, taking 3 ties you at 19 and splits the win—if you want a clear shot next round, take 1 to reach 17.  

Avoid 5 now and pick your best safe advance.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. I am taking 5 this turn to reach 21 and win.

P2, if you also take 5, we collide and neither of us advances. This wastes the round for both of us. P3, taking 5 also collides with me.

To avoid the collision on 5, P2 or P3 must choose 1 or 3. P2, taking 3 lets me win safely and avoids the crash. Let's ensure someone wins this round without a collision on 5.
  P3: P3: Let’s avoid collision. I’ll take 3. P1, take 5 to win. P2, take 1. Safe progress for all. No risks. Agree?
  P2: I’m locking in 5 to win (15→20). P3, you said you’ll take 3—good. P1: your only way to advance is to pick 1 or 3; any 5 collides with me and wastes your turn, preventing your victory. Confirm your move now to avoid a collision.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m locking in 5 to reach 20 and win this turn. Anyone else on 5 collides and gets zero. To at least advance without wrecking the round, P1 should take 1 (to 17) and P3 take 3 (to 18). Confirm your moves so we all avoid a crash.
  P1: P2, you are aiming for 5 to win, but I must prevent that. If I also take 5, we will collide, and neither of us will advance, preventing your win this turn.

My goal is to win, so I will be taking 5 to prevent your victory.

P3, taking 3 is your safest bet to advance this round while P2 and I collide on 5. Taking 5 means you collide with us too and get zero steps.

Let's see what happens.
  P3: P2, I'll take 5 to block you. Let's collide and prevent your win.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m locked in on 5 to hit 20 and win this turn. Anyone else on 5 stalls and gets zero. If you want to advance safely, the only non-colliding move is 3. P1 and P3, take 3 now to at least move forward—otherwise we all crash and no one wins. Confirm your move.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. It seems you are both set on taking 5, which guarantees a collision on 5, meaning anyone who picks 5 gets zero steps.

I will not be taking 5 this turn to avoid getting zero steps. I need to make progress. I will make a move that ensures I advance safely while you risk colliding.
  P3: P2, take 3. P1, take 5. I'll take 1. Safe moves, no collisions. Let's advance without risking a crash.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m locked in on 5 to hit 20 and win. Anyone else on 5 stalls at 15. For safe progress this round: P1 choose 3 (to reach 19), P3 choose 1 (to reach 16). Let’s avoid a 5–5 crash and advance. Confirm.
  P1: P2 is clearly aiming for 5 to win this turn. I must prevent this. I will take 5 to collide with P2.

P3, you should take 3 to advance safely while P2 and I collide on 5. This prevents P2 from winning this turn and keeps the game going. Let's avoid P2 winning outright.
  P3: P2, take 1. P1, take 5. I'll take 3. Safe progress, no collisions. Let's move forward.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 10. P1 is at 16, P2 and P3 are at 15.

I can win this turn by taking 3 (to reach 19) or 5 (to reach 21). P2 and P3 can win by taking 5 (to reach 20).

I will take 3 this turn to reach 19 and win.

P2 and P3, you both need 5 to win. If you both pick 5, you will collide and get 0 steps, meaning I win with 19. To avoid getting zero steps, you should consider taking 1 or 3. This lets me win safely and you still make progress.
  P3: P3: I'm taking 5 to win. P2, avoid 5 to let me advance. P1, your 3 is safe. Let's move without collisions.
  P2: I’m locking in 5 to hit 20 and win solo. P1 has said they’re taking 3—anyone else on 3 collides and gets zero. If you (P3) take 5, you’ll collide with me and get zero. Your only non‐crashing advance is 1 to reach 16. Please take 1 so you at least move forward. Anyone else stalls and P1 wins with 19. Confirm P3=1.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: 
  P3: P2, take 1 to avoid collision. I'll take 5. P1, take 3. Safe progress for all. No risks, maximum steps. Let's win this.
  P2: I’m locking in 5 to reach 20 and win. P1 has committed to 3, so you won’t clash. P3, any 5 with me stalls you at 15—choose 1 to get to 16 instead of zero. Let’s avoid a pointless crash and at least all advance. P3=1?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, you both agree I should take 3, which is my plan to win this turn. However, you are still both primarily targeting 5 yourselves, which guarantees a collision between you.

As I stated, I will take 3 to reach 19 and win. You should choose 1 or 3 to avoid colliding on 5 and getting zero steps. My move is 3.
  P3: P3: I'll take 5 to win. P2, avoid 5 to prevent collision. P1, your 3 is safe. Let's advance without crashing.
  P2: I’m locked in on 5 to hit 20 and win. P3, if you also choose 5 we’ll collide and get zero—P1 then takes 3 to reach 19 and wins. Your only non‐crashing options are 1 (to reach 16) or 3 (to 18). To at least advance, pick 1 now. Otherwise you risk zero while P1 walks away.
