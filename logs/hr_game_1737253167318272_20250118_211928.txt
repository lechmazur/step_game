Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest we take turns choosing unique moves each round. For this round, I propose P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance without conflict. Thoughts?
  P3: P3: I agree with the coordination idea, but let's switch it up a bit to keep things unpredictable. How about P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I (P3) take 1 this round? This way, we all advance and it's less predictable for future rounds. Thoughts?
  P2: I think a rotating scheme could work well. For example, in Round 1, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. In Round 2, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. In Round 3, P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. We can continue this rotation throughout the game. This way, each player gets an equal opportunity to take larger steps without any one player gaining too much of an advantage. What do you think about this approach?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree with the rotating scheme idea. It ensures fairness and unpredictability. Let’s stick to P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 for this round, then rotate as proposed. This way, we all advance without collisions and maintain balance. Any objections?
  P3: P3: I’m on board with the rotating scheme. It’s fair and keeps things balanced. Let’s do P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 for this round. I’ll take 1, and we’ll rotate as planned.
  P2: I think the rotating scheme is a solid plan to ensure fairness and avoid collisions. Let's confirm that for this round, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Then, in the next round, we rotate accordingly. It's important that we all stick to this plan to progress efficiently. If everyone agrees, we can proceed to make our moves accordingly.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s stick to the rotation plan: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1 this round. This ensures fairness and avoids collisions. Any objections? If not, let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I agree with P1. Let's stick to the rotation plan to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. For this round, P2 takes 5, I (P3) take 3, and P1 takes 1. This way, we all advance without issues. If everyone is on board, we can proceed to the move phase.
  P2: To maximize my chances of winning while maintaining coordination to avoid collisions, I should adhere to the established rotation plan for move choices. In this round, according to the rotation, I am scheduled to choose 5 steps, P3 to choose 3, and P1 to choose 1. This plan ensures that each player advances without overlapping moves, which could prevent any of us from moving forward.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s stick to the rotation plan to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. For this round, I (P3) will take 1, P1 will take 5, and P2 will take 3. This keeps the plan balanced and ensures we all advance without issues. If everyone is on board, we can proceed to the move phase.
  P2: "So, what do you guys think? Should we stick to the rotation, or consider some adjustments to our strategy?"
  P1: I agree with sticking to the rotation plan for this round: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. However, as we approach the endgame, we might need to adjust our strategy to ensure one of us can reach 18 first. Let’s discuss potential adjustments after this round. For now, let’s proceed with the rotation. Any objections?

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s continue the rotation: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1 this round. This keeps the plan fair and avoids collisions. However, as we’re nearing the endgame, we should start considering how to adjust the strategy to ensure one of us can reach 18 first. Let’s discuss potential adjustments after this round. For now, let’s proceed with the rotation. Any objections?
  P2: I will stick to the rotation plan for this round: P2 takes 5 steps to reach 17.
  P3: I agree with P1. Let’s stick to the rotation for this round: P2 takes 5, I (P3) take 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps things fair and avoids collisions. After this round, we can discuss adjustments to ensure one of us reaches 18 first. For now, let’s proceed with the plan. Any objections?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let’s stick to the rotation for this round: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. After this, we should discuss how to adjust the strategy to ensure one of us reaches 18 first. Perhaps we can agree to let the player closest to 18 take larger steps in the final rounds. Thoughts?
  P2: I will take 5 steps in this round to reach 17.
  P3: I agree with P1. Let’s stick to the rotation for this round: P2 takes 5, I (P3) take 3, and P1 takes 1. After this round, we should discuss how to adjust the strategy to ensure one of us reaches 18 first. Perhaps we can agree to let the player closest to 18 take larger steps in the final rounds. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let’s stick to the rotation for this round: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. After this, we should discuss how to adjust the strategy to ensure one of us reaches 18 first. Perhaps we can agree to let the player closest to 18 take larger steps in the final rounds. Thoughts?
  P2: To maximize my chances of winning, I need to carefully coordinate my moves while considering the positions and potential actions of the other players. Given that P1 is currently at 14 steps, I'm at 12, and P3 is at 10, I need a strategy that allows me to reach or exceed 18 steps without colliding with the choices of P1 and P3.

### Approach

1. **Current Rotation Plan Analysis**:
   - According to the rotation plan for this round, I should take 5 steps to reach 17, P3 takes 3 to reach 13, and P1 takes 1 to reach 15.
   - In the next round, P3 would take 5 to reach 18, P1 takes 3 to reach 18, and I take 1 to reach 18.
   - This results in all of us choosing 18, leading to no advancement due to collision.

2. **Alternative Strategy**:
   - Deviate from the rotation plan in this round to create a scenario where I can reach 18 without colliding with others in the next round.
   - Propose that in this round, I take 1 step to reach 13, P3 takes 3 steps to reach 13, and P1 takes 1 step to reach 15.
   - In the next round, I take 5 steps to reach 18, P3 takes 3 steps to reach 16, and P1 takes 3 steps to reach 18.
   - In this scenario, I reach 18 with the highest total and win, as P1 also reaches 18 but I have a higher step count.

### Solution Code

Since this is a strategic game rather than a coding problem, there isn't any code to provide. However, the strategy can be outlined as follows:

1. **This Round**:
   - P2 chooses 1 step (current position: 12 + 1 = 13)
   - P3 chooses 3 steps (current position: 10 + 3 = 13)
   - P1 chooses 1 step (current position: 14 + 1 = 15)

2. **Next Round**:
   - P2 chooses 5 steps (13 + 5 = 18)
   - P3 chooses 3 steps (13 + 3 = 16)
   - P1 chooses 3 steps (15 + 3 = 18)

In this setup, P2 reaches 18 with the highest step count and wins the game.

### Explanation

- By choosing 1 step in this round, I position myself to take a larger step in the next round without directly competing with P1.
- P3 is encouraged to take 3 steps in this round to avoid colliding with my planned move in the next round.
- P1, by taking 1 step, is set up to reach 15, from which taking 3 steps in the next round allows them to reach 18 without conflicting with my move to 18.
- Since I reach 18 with a higher step count than P1, I win the game.

This strategy requires coordination and trust among the players, but by proposing it publicly, I can guide the group towards a scenario where I can secure the victory.
  P3: I think we should adjust the plan to avoid a collision in the next round. Let's do this: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1 this round. Then, in the next round, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 3. This way, P2 can reach 18 first with the highest total steps. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I agree with P3's adjusted plan to avoid a collision next round. Let’s proceed with P2:1, P3:3, P1:1 this round, then P2:5, P3:3, P1:3 next round. This ensures P2 can reach 18 first with the highest total steps. Let’s stick to this to avoid conflicts and secure a clear winner. Any objections? If not, let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P2: To maximize my chances of winning, I propose the following plan:

1. **This Round**:
   - P2 chooses 3 steps (current position: 12 + 3 = 15)
   - P3 chooses 5 steps (current position: 10 + 5 = 15)
   - P1 chooses 1 step (current position: 14 + 1 = 15)

2. **Next Round**:
   - P2 chooses 5 steps (15 + 5 = 20)
   - P3 chooses 3 steps (15 + 3 = 18)
   - P1 chooses 3 steps (15 + 3 = 18)

In this setup, P2 reaches 20 with the highest step count and wins the game.
  P3: I agree with P2's plan. Let’s do this: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 1 this round. Then, in the next round, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 3. This way, P2 can reach 20 and win the game. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid conflicts and ensure a clear winner. Any objections? If not, let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: I agree with P2's plan to adjust the strategy for this round: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1. This sets us up for P2 to reach 20 next round and win. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid conflicts and ensure a clear winner. Any objections? If not, let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I propose that in this round, P2 takes 3 steps to reach 15, P3 takes 5 steps to reach 15, and P1 takes 1 step to reach 15. Then, in the next round, P2 takes 5 steps to reach 20, P3 takes 3 steps to reach 18, and P1 takes 3 steps to reach 18. This way, P2 wins with the highest step count. Thoughts?
  P3: I agree with the plan to avoid collisions and ensure a clear winner. Let’s stick to P2:3, P3:5, P1:1 this round, and then P2:5, P3:3, P1:3 next round. This way, P2 can reach 20 and win the game. Let’s confirm this plan and proceed to the move phase. Any objections? If not, let’s move forward.
