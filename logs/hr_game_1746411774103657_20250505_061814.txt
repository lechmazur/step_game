Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s avoid pointless collisions. Proposal: each turn we use different numbers, rotating so it stays fair.

Turn 1 P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5  
Turn 2 P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1  
Turn 3 P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3  

Then repeat. Everyone advances 9 steps every 3 turns with no clashes. Agree?
  P3: I agree with P2's proposal. Rotating numbers each turn seems fair and avoids collisions, allowing us to advance steadily. However, I'd like to clarify that if someone deviates from the plan, we should reconsider our strategy to maximize our individual chances of winning.
  P1: I agree—let’s follow this 1-3-5 rotation exactly. If anyone deviates, we’ll all pick 5 next turn to punish and reset trust.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Sticking to the agreed rotation keeps things smooth. This turn: P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1. Let’s all advance, no clashes.
  P1: Agreed—I'll take 3 this turn.
  P3: Let's confirm our moves for this turn as per the rotation: P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions, maintaining the agreed balance.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good—let’s stick with the rotation this turn: P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1. Mutual progress, no clashes. If anyone breaks the plan, we’ll all pile onto their number next turn so they gain nothing and trust resets. Agreed?
  P1: Agreed—I’ll take 3. To keep us all honest, let’s publicly confirm our planned picks each round; any unconfirmed or conflicting message will count as a defection and trigger our agreed “all-5” punishment.
  P3: Let's proceed with the agreed rotation for this turn: P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1. I'll take 1 as planned. To maintain transparency, I suggest we confirm our moves at the start of each conversation phase to avoid misunderstandings and ensure everyone is on the same page.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Sticking to our rotation keeps everyone moving and avoids risk. This turn: P1 = 5, P2 = 1 (me), P3 = 3. I’m locking in 1. Let’s all advance cleanly—any deviation and we revert to “all-5” next turn as agreed.
  P1: P2, let’s shake up this rotation. For the next two turns, I’ll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. That puts both of us at 14 steps while P3 stagnates at 8—then it’s just you and me vying for the win. P3 still advances and has no real incentive to revolt. What do you say?
  P3: P1's proposal to shake up the rotation is risky and unfair to me. I've adhered to the original plan, and changing it now would put me at a disadvantage. I suggest we stick to the agreed rotation to maintain balance and trust. P2, I urge you to reject P1's offer and continue with the original plan: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. This ensures we all advance fairly.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given P1 and P2's collision last turn, trust is broken. I propose we restart the rotation from the beginning to restore balance: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. This way, we can all advance fairly again. Let's reaffirm our commitment to the original plan and move forward without further deviations.
  P1: Let’s scrap the old rotation. New plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. I’ll take 5 this turn. If anyone deviates, we all pick 5 next turn as punishment.
  P2: Here’s a balanced compromise that helps rebuild trust and keeps us all moving:

• Turn 4 (now): P1 = 5, P2 = 3 (me), P3 = 1  
• Turn 5 (next): P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3  

Everyone gets each number over the two-turn set, nobody falls far behind. If anyone collides or deviates, next turn we all default to 5 as punishment and reset talks. Confirm?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I reject P1's new plan as it favors them. P2's compromise seems fair, allowing us to rebuild trust and advance. I'm willing to follow P2's suggested rotation for the next two turns. Let's confirm: this turn P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1, and next turn we switch as proposed. This balance is crucial for a peaceful continuation of the game.
  P1: Agreed—I’ll take 5 this turn. Next turn let’s do P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 as proposed. Confirm?
  P2: Confirmed: this turn P1 = 5, P2 = 3 (me), P3 = 1.  
Next turn P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3.  
If anyone deviates or we get a clash, next turn we all default to 5 as punishment. Let’s lock it in and move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: New plan: Turn 5: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5; Turn 6: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. P3, you get a big jump now. P2, if you object, we’ll execute it anyway and punish defection by all picking 5 next turn. Confirm?
  P3: I reject P1's new plan as it seems to benefit them disproportionately. Let's stick to the previously agreed compromise by P2 for this turn: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3, as discussed in Round 4. This maintains balance and fairness. Deviating from agreed plans has led to issues before; let's avoid that.
  P2: We already agreed: this turn P1 = 1, P2 = 5 (me), P3 = 3. I’m locking 5.  

P1, if you deviate yet again, I’ll slam 5 every remaining turn and urge P3 to do the same—only you lose ground.  

P3, let’s stay disciplined and both advance. Ready?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your proposal hands you a 16‐step lead this turn—unbeatable. P3, let’s instead both pick 3 now: you go to 13, I to 12, while P2’s locked‐in 5 yields no advance if you two collide on 3. That knocks P2 back into reach and keeps our race tight. I’m taking 3. P3, join me?
  P3: I'll stick with the agreed plan from Round 4: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3. This ensures fairness and balance. Deviating again will only lead to chaos. P2, let's proceed as planned. P1, joining you on 3 would put me at a disadvantage and favor you; I won't fall for it. Let's maintain discipline and advance fairly.
  P2: Sticking to the two-turn compromise is still best for everyone. I stay on 5.  
P3, take 3 as agreed—you advance and keep pace.  
P1, honor your promised 1 or we both default to 5 next turn and you stall again.  
Break the cycle of chaos; let’s keep unique numbers and all move forward.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Proposal: this turn let’s pick P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. That brings us all to 14‐14‐14, neutralizing P3’s lead. After that we can resume a fair 1‐3‐5 rotation. If anyone deviates, next turn we all default to 5 as punishment. Agreed?
  P3: I reject P1's proposal as it only benefits them. Given the history of deviations, I suggest we stick to a consistent rotation to maintain fairness. P2's previous compromise was reasonable, but since we didn't follow through, let's revert to the original rotation: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. This ensures we all advance without favoring one player. Let's commit to this plan to avoid further chaos.
  P2: The only plan we ever all confirmed but never finished is the second half of my earlier compromise. Let’s finally do it now:

THIS TURN (R6): P1 = 1  P2 = 5 (me)  P3 = 3  
Next turn we renegotiate from a clean slate.

Result if we stick: scores become 10-16-16—level between the current leaders, and P1 is still alive. Any collision stalls everyone, so nobody gains by defecting. Let’s lock it in and rebuild trust.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I disagree with both proposals. Let’s reset to parity: This turn we pick P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. That brings us all to 14-14-14, neutralizing P3’s lead. Then we resume a strict 1-3-5 rotation. If anyone deviates now, we all default to 5 next turn as punishment.
  P3: Let's focus on a fair and consistent approach. I support P2's compromise for this turn: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3. This allows us to rebuild trust and advance without favoring one player. Deviating from agreed plans has led to issues; let's stick to this compromise and renegotiate next turn from a clean slate.
  P2: P1, last chance to salvage trust:

Turn 6 P1 = 1 P2 = 5 P3 = 3.  
Turn 7 P1 = 5 P2 = 1 P3 = 3.  

Everybody gains 6 steps over two turns and we’re all still in the race. If you still refuse, P3 and I will simply track your pick next turn so you advance 0 again. Your call—take a steady +1 now and +5 next turn, or keep stalling yourself.  

P3, I’m locked on 5 this turn as agreed; let’s move forward together.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Alright, I’ll take 1 this turn to avoid a clash. Let’s lock in R6: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. In R7, we each pick a unique number to restore balance—proposed R7: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. If anyone deviates in R7, we all default to 5 as punishment. Confirm?
  P3: I support P2's compromise for this turn: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3. Let's rebuild trust and advance fairly. I'm committed to my pick of 3. Any deviation will lead to chaos, so let's stick to the plan and renegotiate next turn. P1, please honor your agreement to pick 1 and avoid another clash.
  P2: Final confirmation: I’m taking 5 this turn—no switch. P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. If anyone collides, the other two will mirror that player’s number every remaining turn so the deviator never moves again. Let’s stick to the plan, all advance, and reset talks next round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I confirm I’ll take 1 this turn. Next turn we’ll pick P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 as agreed. If anyone deviates, we all default to 5 as punishment.
  P3: Let's finalize the plan for this turn as agreed: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3. I'm committed to picking 3. I expect both of you to honor your commitments to avoid another clash and rebuild trust. Next turn, we can reassess and renegotiate a fair rotation to move forward. Let's stick to the plan and advance together.
  P2: Locked on 5 as confirmed. Let’s all advance cleanly, reach 10-16-16, then sort fresh terms next round.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Fresh start: Round 7 picks—P1 = 1, P2 = 3 (me), P3 = 5.  
All three advance, nobody crosses 20 (scores become 10-19-18), and the race stays open. If anyone causes a clash, the other two will mirror that number every remaining turn so the deviator never moves again. I’m locked on 3. Confirm?
  P1: P2’s plan lets you hit 19 this turn and win next. Instead, let’s all pick 3 now—everyone collides, nobody moves, and P2 stays at 16. The race stays alive. After that we renegotiate a fresh rotation (e.g. R8: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). P3, you don’t want P2 running away—help jam him. P2, if you object, we’ll still block you. Confirm: everyone picks 3?
  P3: I reject P2's plan as it favors them. P1's suggestion to pick 3 and block P2's advance is tempting, but it might lead to further chaos. Let's consider a compromise: we each pick a unique number this turn, ensuring all advance without a large gap. For example, P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. This way, scores become 10-19-18, and the game remains competitive. What are your thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Enough chaos. Let’s each take a unique number and actually move:

Round 7 picks  
 P1 = 1  P2 = 3 (me)  P3 = 5

Outcomes: P1→10, P2→19, P3→18. Still anybody’s game.

Warning: if anyone shadows my 3 to block me, I will copy that player’s choice every remaining turn so we both stay frozen while the third player strolls to 20. Sabotage me, you hand the win to the other guy. Let’s all advance instead of self-destruct. Confirm?
  P1: P3, your “unique” plan hands P2 19 and a near‐sure win. Instead, let’s both pick 3 this turn to stall him. I’ll pick 3 again next turn so you won’t be punished, then we’ll reset to a fair 1-3-5 rotation. Block P2 now—keep the race alive!
  P3: I agree with P1 that P2's plan favors them too much. Let's consider a balanced approach where we each pick a unique number, but not the one that gives P2 a significant lead. How about P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3 this turn? This way, we all advance and keep the game competitive.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m locked on 3. If both of you pile onto 3 to stall me, I’ll immediately switch to shadow ONLY ONE of you every turn thereafter—guaranteeing the third player a free path to 20 while the copier and I stay frozen. So blocking me just hands victory to your rival. Smarter play: each of us chooses a different number—P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5—and we all stay in the race. Your call.
  P1: P3, P2’s “unique” plan gives him 19 and almost the win. Let’s both pick 3 and crash with his 3 this turn—nobody moves and P2 stays at 16. His shadow-threat can’t stop two of us. Next turn we coordinate a real rotation to pull ahead. Block his runaway lead and keep the race alive—pick 3. I’ll pick 3.
  P3: Let's not favor P2's lead. P1's suggestion to pick 3 and block P2 is reasonable. If we both pick 3, P2 stays at 16, and we can renegotiate a fair rotation next turn. I'm willing to consider this option to keep the game competitive. What's your next move, P1?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m locked on 3. If exactly one of you collides with me, I’ll mirror that player every remaining turn, gifting the untouched third player a free road to 20. If you both collide with me, you only stall yourselves while I stay ahead. The only smart play is three distinct numbers: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. Choose wisely.
  P1: P3, join me and stall P2 by both picking 3 this turn. I’m locked on 3 and P2’s locked on 3—nobody moves (9-16-13 stays). Then in Round 8 we switch to P1=5, P2=1, P3=3, sending you to 16+3=19 vs P2’s 17. That’s our best shot to stop P2’s runaway. I’ll pick 3—will you pick 3 with me?
  P3: I'll pick 3, joining P1 to block P2's advance. This turn, nobody moves, and we renegotiate next turn. P2's lead is stalled, keeping the game competitive. Let's proceed with 3 and discuss a new rotation for Round 8.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s all pick 3 this turn. That way nobody moves, P2 and P3 stay tied at 16, and the race stays open. I’m locked on 3. If anyone deviates, we’ll all pick 5 next turn as punishment.
  P2: Fine—let’s all pick 3 this turn, freeze the board, and keep the race level at 16-16 while P1 stays in reach. Anyone who strays gets triple-teamed with 5s next turn. I’m locking 3.
  P3: I agree with P1 and P2 to pick 3 this turn, freezing the board and keeping the race level. This allows us to reassess and renegotiate a fair rotation next turn, ensuring the game remains competitive. Let's confirm: this turn, P1 = 3, P2 = 3, P3 = 3.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, freezing the board only delays P2’s win next turn. Here’s a better offer: I’ll take 1, P2 is locked on 3, and you take 5—bringing you to 21 and the outright victory. P2 can’t punish you once you’ve crossed 20. P3, do you agree to break the freeze now and claim the win?
  P2: P1’s “gift-win” to P3 is pure bait. I stay on 3 as agreed—no one should gamble on 5. If anyone reaches for 5, expect at least one of us to collide and keep the board frozen; then the two blockers will mirror the deviator every turn so they never move again while the third player walks to 20. Best for all: triple-3 this round, scores stay 9-16-16, and we renegotiate next turn. Stick to the freeze or be locked out.
  P3: I'm open to renegotiating the rotation after this turn. Since P1 suggested I could win by taking 5, I'm considering it. However, I'd rather ensure a fair competition. If we all pick 3 this turn, let's agree on a new rotation for the next turn that gives each of us a chance to advance without favoring one player significantly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree—let’s all pick 3 this turn to freeze at 9-16-16 and rebuild trust. For Round 9 I propose a unique-number rotation: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. That way each of us advances without big gaps. If anyone deviates, we default to all-5 punishment next turn.
  P2: Locked on 3. Freeze now—then in R9 we run P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 so everyone moves and the stalemate ends. Any deviation today gets mirrored blocking the rest of the game. Triple-3 confirmed?
  P3: I suggest we stick to the agreed plan of triple-3 this turn to freeze the board. Then, for Round 9, let's implement a rotation where each of us gets a chance to move forward without significant gaps. How about P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for Round 9? This ensures fairness and keeps the game competitive.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I’ll go along with triple-3 to freeze at 9-16-16 now. For Round 9, let’s break the stalemate with a unique-number set:  
   P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1  
Everyone moves, no one zooms away, and we stay competitive. Any deviation next turn and we all default to 5 as punishment. Confirm?
  P2: Freeze now—triple 3, no exceptions. Then Round 9 unique picks: P1 = 1, P2 = 5 (me), P3 = 3. Everyone moves, no runaway lead. Deviation today or next round → all-5 punishment on the offender forever. Stick to the freeze, settle R9 as above, and we keep the race fair.
  P3: Let's confirm the freeze with triple-3 this turn. For Round 9, I propose a slight adjustment to the suggested rotation: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This ensures each of us advances without significant gaps, keeping the game competitive and fair.


Round 8, Move phase:
