Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's think strategically about our moves. If we coordinate, we can avoid collisions. I suggest we all aim for different numbers this turn. Maybe P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5? This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. What do you both think?
  P1: Your plan is fine in spirit, but since 1-step is a real handicap, why don’t we rotate? Turn 1: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Next turn we shift them (P2 gets 5, etc.). Everyone advances and no one’s stuck with 1 all game. Sound fair?
  P2: I appreciate the ideas for coordination. P1’s rotation plan sounds fair to ensure no one is stuck with the smallest step repeatedly. I’m okay with starting with 3 this turn as suggested. Let’s stick to this rotation for at least a few rounds to keep things balanced and avoid collisions. Does this work for both of you?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I like the idea of rotating our moves for fairness. For this turn, I’ll go along with P1’s suggestion: I’ll take 1 step while P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 3. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. After this round, we can reassess and adjust our moves for the next turn. Let’s keep this strategy in mind to ensure we all progress smoothly! What do you both think?
  P1: Great, let’s lock it in:  
• Round 1 moves – P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1.  
Then we rotate next round (P2 gets 5, P3 3, P1 1). Everyone good? If so, I’m set.
  P2: I'm glad we're on the same page with the rotation plan. Let's confirm for Round 1: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. We’ll rotate next round as agreed. I think this keeps things fair and ensures we all progress. If there are no objections or new ideas, I'm ready to move forward with this.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m glad we’ve all agreed on the moves for Round 1. Just to clarify, we’ll stick to the rotation plan for the next rounds. If everyone is still on board with this strategy, I’m ready to finalize my move for Round 1. Let’s keep communication open for future rounds to adapt if needed. If there are no further thoughts, I’ll be set for my move!
  P1: All clear—let’s stick with the agreed plan for this turn: P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1. We’ll rotate next round and discuss again then. If everyone’s set, I’m ready to move.
  P2: I'm happy with our agreed plan for Round 1: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's stick to the rotation for the next round as discussed. If there are no changes or concerns, I'm ready to proceed with this turn. Looking forward to seeing how this strategy plays out.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since we all agreed to rotate our moves, I suggest we stick to that plan for Round 2. P1 should take 1 step this time, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 3. This way, we avoid collisions and keep advancing. After this round, we can reassess again. If everyone is on board, let’s confirm our moves! What do you both think?
  P2: I'm disappointed that we had a collision last round, as I stuck to the agreed plan. Let's ensure we follow through this time. I agree with P3's suggestion for Round 2: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This rotation keeps things fair, and we can avoid blocking each other. I'm committed to this plan and hope we all are. If there are no objections, I'm ready to proceed with this turn. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 broke the deal last turn (you played 1, not 3), so trust is shaky. Let’s reset:

• P1 = 5  
• P3 = 3  
• P2 = 1 (show good faith after last round’s miss)

No collision, everyone advances, and we can restart a fair rotation next turn once trust’s rebuilt. Agree?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I understand the trust issue, P1. However, I think we should stick to our rotation plan to keep things fair. My suggestion for Round 2 remains: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances. If we can agree on this, we can reassess and build trust for future rounds. What do you both think?
  P2: I'm sorry for the mix-up last round; I genuinely thought I was following the plan but clearly made an error. To rebuild trust, I'm willing to stick to the rotation as originally agreed. For Round 2, I’ll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3, as per the rotation. Let’s commit to this to ensure we all advance without collisions. If everyone agrees, I’m ready to proceed. What do you both think?
  P1: Alright—let’s rebuild trust by sticking to the rotation just this once.  
Round 2: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3.  
After we see the results, we can discuss a fresh plan. Sound good?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate the willingness to rebuild trust, P1 and P2. Let's confirm our moves for Round 2: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances. After this round, we can reassess our strategy for the next turn. If everyone is on board, I'm ready to finalize my move! Let’s keep the momentum going! What do you both think?
  P2: I'm glad we're aligning on the rotation for Round 2: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. I’m committed to this plan to rebuild trust after my mistake last round. Let’s ensure we all advance this turn and discuss any adjustments afterward. If there are no further concerns, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: Confirmed: Round 2 moves  
• P1 = 1  
• P2 = 5  
• P3 = 3  

If everyone’s locked, let’s each reply “” so we can end the convo and move.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm glad we’ve confirmed our moves for Round 2: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. Let’s stick to this plan and focus on rebuilding trust. After this round, we can reassess our strategies going forward. If everyone’s ready, let’s finalize our moves and see how this plays out. Looking forward to our progress! If there are no further thoughts, I’ll respond with “ready.”
  P2: I'm glad we've agreed on the Round 2 moves: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Let's stick to this plan to ensure we all advance and rebuild trust after my mistake last round. If there are no further concerns or changes, I'm ready to finalize my move. Looking forward to seeing our progress this turn.

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm glad we successfully followed the rotation last round and all advanced. For Round 3, as per our rotation plan, it should be P1 taking 3, P3 taking 5, and I’ll take 1. This keeps things fair and ensures we avoid collisions. Let’s stick to this to maintain trust and progress together. After this round, we can discuss if any adjustments are needed. If everyone agrees, I’m ready to proceed with this plan. What do you both think?
  P1: Works for me: Round 3 moves ­– P1 = 3, P3 = 5, P2 = 1. Ready when you are.
  P3: P3: I'm glad we're all on the same page for Round 3. Just to confirm, I’ll take 5 steps this turn while P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 1. This keeps us aligned with our rotation plan and avoids any collisions. After this round, we can reassess our strategy if needed. If everyone is good with this, let’s finalize our moves! What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm pleased we're maintaining the rotation. Let's confirm for Round 3: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1. This keeps us on track to avoid collisions and ensures fairness. If there are no objections or new ideas, I'm ready to finalize my move. Looking forward to continuing our progress together. If everyone’s set, let’s move forward with this plan. What do you both think?
  P1: ready
  P3: I appreciate the alignment on our moves for Round 3. Just to confirm, I’ll take 5 steps as agreed, while P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 1. This rotation strategy seems to be working well for us. After this round, we can reassess and discuss any necessary adjustments. If everyone is ready, let’s finalize our moves and see how we progress! Looking forward to it!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm glad we're sticking to the rotation for Round 3: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1. This keeps us moving forward without collisions and maintains fairness. If everyone’s locked in, I’m ready to finalize my move. Let’s keep the momentum and discuss any changes after this round if needed. If there are no further thoughts, I'm set to proceed.
  P1: ready
  P3: I appreciate our commitment to the rotation and the progress we've made. Just to confirm for Round 3: I'll take 5 steps, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions. After this round, we can evaluate our strategy again. If everyone is good with this, let's finalize our moves and see how we advance! Ready to proceed!


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm glad we're aligned for Round 3 with P1 taking 3, P3 taking 5, and me taking 1. This rotation keeps us progressing fairly without collisions. Let's finalize our moves and maintain this momentum. If there are no further concerns or changes, I'm ready to proceed.
  P1: Last call: I’m on 3 as agreed—let’s roll.
  P3: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the rotation. Just to recap, for Round 3, we agreed on P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and I’ll take 5. This plan helps us avoid collisions and keeps us all advancing. After this round, we can discuss any adjustments needed for future moves. If everyone’s still on board, let’s finalize our moves and see how we progress! Ready to move forward!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: For Round 4, I suggest we continue our rotation to keep things fair. P1 should take 5 steps, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. This way, we avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances. After this round, we can reassess our strategy again. If everyone agrees, let’s confirm our moves! What do you both think?
  P1: Works for me. Round 4 moves:  
• P1 = 5  
• P2 = 3  
• P3 = 1  

Let’s run this cleanly, then revisit whether we keep using the 1-step next round so nobody’s stuck crawling. I’m locked on 5—ready when you are.
  P2: I'm good with the rotation for Round 4: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us advancing without collisions and maintains fairness. Let's stick to this plan and reassess after the round if we want to tweak the rotation to avoid anyone being stuck on smaller steps too often. If there are no objections, I'm ready to finalize my move. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I appreciate everyone’s commitment to the rotation for Round 4. Just to recap, we agreed on P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and I’ll take 1. This strategy keeps us moving forward without collisions. After this round, we can discuss any potential adjustments to the rotation to ensure fairness for everyone. If everyone is still on board, let’s finalize our moves and see how we progress! If there are no further thoughts, I’m ready to proceed. What do you both think?
  P1: Locked on 5. After this round, maybe we drop the 1-step entirely—it drags whoever gets it. Proposal for Round 5 onward: only 5 and 3 are used, with the 5 rotating (next P3, then P2, then me). Quicker game, still fair. We can confirm after we see today’s results. Ready.
  P2: I'm glad we're sticking with the rotation for Round 4: P1 on 5, me on 3, and P3 on 1. I like P1's idea to potentially drop the 1-step from Round 5 onward and rotate between 5 and 3 to speed up the game while keeping it fair. Let's finalize this round's moves and discuss that adjustment after seeing the results. If there are no objections, I'm ready to proceed. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m glad we’ve all agreed on the moves for Round 4: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. After this round, I think it’s a good idea to consider dropping the 1-step to speed up the game. Let’s finalize our moves for this round, and then we can discuss the new rotation for Round 5. If everyone’s ready, let’s proceed! Looking forward to seeing how we all advance!
  P1: All right, I’m locked on 5. If everyone else is set—P2 on 3, P3 on 1—let’s wrap this convo and move. After results we can hash out the 5-and-3-only rotation to speed things up. Ready when you are.
  P2: I'm glad we're aligned for Round 4 with P1 on 5, me on 3, and P3 on 1. I support the idea of dropping the 1-step from Round 5 to make the game faster and fairer. Let's finalize this round's moves and confirm the new 5-and-3 rotation afterward. If there are no further concerns, I'm ready to proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm ready to finalize our moves for Round 4: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. After this round, I think we should definitely consider the proposed rotation of only using 5 and 3 in future turns to speed up the game. It seems fair and will help us all advance more efficiently. If everyone is good with our current moves, let’s wrap this up and see how we progress! Ready when you are!
  P1: All set: Round 4 stays P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1. We’ll switch to 5-and-3-only rotation next turn unless someone objects afterward. Ready – let’s move.
  P2: I'm glad we're set for Round 4 with P1 on 5, me on 3, and P3 on 1. I’m fully on board with switching to a 5-and-3-only rotation from Round 5 to keep the game moving faster while staying fair. Let’s finalize this round’s moves and confirm the new plan after the results. If there are no last-minute concerns, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: For Round 5, I propose we stick to the new plan of only using 5 and 3 steps. I suggest: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5 as well. This way, we can maximize our advancement without collisions. If everyone agrees, let’s confirm our moves and keep the momentum going! What do you both think?
  P2: I'm glad we're moving to a 5-and-3 rotation to speed things up. However, P3, your suggestion of both you and P1 taking 5 will cause a collision, preventing you both from advancing. Let's adjust to avoid this. I propose: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 3. Since only two can advance with 3 without colliding, P3, are you okay with this, or should we rethink? This keeps us progressing fairly. If everyone agrees, I'm ready to proceed. What do you both think?
  P1: I’m good with P2’s proposal:  
Round 5 – P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 3.  
No collisions if we stick to it, and we can rotate the 5 next turn for fairness. Everyone on board?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I agree with P1's suggestion for Round 5: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 3 as well. This way, we avoid collisions and keep advancing fairly. After this round, we can rotate the 5 for the next turn to ensure everyone gets a chance to use it. If everyone’s on board, let’s finalize these moves and keep the game moving! Ready to proceed!
  P2: I'm glad we're aligning on a no-collision plan for Round 5. Let's confirm: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 3. This ensures we all advance while keeping things fair. We can rotate the 5 next turn to maintain balance. If there are no objections or alternative ideas, I'm ready to finalize my move. Let's keep the momentum going and reassess after this round if needed. What do you both think?
  P1: Confirmed for this turn: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 3. Next round we rotate the 5 to keep things balanced. Ready on my side—let’s wrap up and move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate the alignment on our moves for Round 5: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 3 as well. This strategy avoids collisions and allows us all to advance.

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: The triple-5 mishap proves we must stick to DISTINCT numbers. Let’s restart the old rotation:

Round 6: P1 = 5,  P2 = 3,  P3 = 1  
Round 7: P3 = 5,  P1 = 3,  P2 = 1  
Round 8: P2 = 5,  P3 = 3,  P1 = 1  

No collisions, everyone advances, and the “1” keeps rotating so no one’s stuck. If you’re good, just reply “ok” so we can move.
  P2: I'm disappointed we all collided on 5 last round. Let's avoid that by sticking to distinct numbers as P1 suggested. I agree with the proposed rotation for Round 6: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's commit to this plan for the next few rounds to ensure we all advance without collisions. We can reassess later if needed. If everyone’s on board, I’m ready to proceed. What do you both think?

Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great—let’s lock Round 6 right now:

• P1 = 5  
• P2 = 3  
• P3 = 1  

No last-minute switches; any collision just wastes another turn. After we see the results we can revisit dropping the 1-step, but for this round let’s bank the easy progress. If you’re set, please reply “ready” and we’ll move.
  P2: I'm glad we're aligning on distinct numbers for Round 6: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm frustrated by yet another collision last round between P1 and P3 on 5, despite our agreement. Let's ensure distinct moves for Round 7. As per the rotation plan from P1 earlier, it should be P3 on 5, P1 on 3, and me on 1. This avoids collisions and keeps us advancing fairly. We can discuss dropping the 1-step after this round if needed. If everyone commits to this, I'm ready to proceed. What do you both think?
  P1: Clearly we need distinct numbers. Simple fix:

Round 7  
• P1 = 5  (I’ll stay on 5 so no surprises)  
• P3 = 3  (different from me, solid progress)  
• P2 = 1  (just this turn—next we rotate)

No overlaps, everyone moves. If that’s acceptable, type “ok” and let’s finally bank some steps.
  P3: P3: I agree we need distinct moves to avoid collisions. For Round 7, I’m on board with P1’s proposal: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. After this round, we can reassess our strategy again. If everyone’s good with this, let’s finalize our moves and keep the game moving!

If everyone’s on board, I’m ready to finalize my move. What do you both think?
  P1: Let’s lock it: Round 7 = P1 5, P3 3, P2 1. No swaps, no tricks—if anyone duplicates, we all lose ground again. After we see these results we can renegotiate, but for this turn please stick to these distinct numbers so we finally move forward. Type “ready” if you’re committed.
  P3: I agree with the proposed moves for Round 7: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. This keeps us distinct and avoids collisions, allowing everyone to advance. Let’s commit to this plan without any last-minute changes, so we can finally make progress. After this round, we can discuss any adjustments needed for future rounds. If everyone’s on board, I’m ready to finalize my move! Please reply “ready” if you’re committed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm glad we're sticking with distinct moves for Round 7: P1 on 5, P3 on 3, and me on 1. This plan ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's stay committed to these numbers with no last-minute changes to keep the trust and progress going. After this round, we can revisit the rotation or discuss dropping the 1-step if needed. If everyone’s still on board, I’m ready to finalize my move. Please reply “ready” if you’re set to proceed. Let’s make this turn count!
  P1: ready
  P3: I appreciate everyone's commitment to distinct moves for Round 7. Just to confirm, I'm ready to proceed with the agreed plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3.

Please reply “ready” if you're set to proceed. Let’s make this turn count!
  P1: Just need P3’s “ready” to close Round 7: P1 = 5, P3 = 3, P2 = 1—no last-second swaps. If all good, we’ll rotate next turn (P3 5, P1 3, P2 1) so everyone keeps moving. Ready here.
  P3: I appreciate everyone's commitment to distinct moves for Round 7. Just to confirm, I'm ready to proceed with the agreed plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. This ensures we avoid collisions and allows everyone to advance. After this round, we can discuss any necessary adjustments for future turns. If everyone’s still on board, please reply “ready” so we can finalize our moves and keep the game moving! Looking forward to seeing our progress!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s lock distinct numbers this turn and rotate next.

Round 8  
• P1 = 3  
• P2 = 5  
• P3 = 1  

Leader gets 5, trailer gets 1, nobody collides. Round 9 we rotate right (P3 5 / P1 1 / P2 3). If you’re good with that, just reply “ok”.
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal for Round 8: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions, and the rotation for Round 9 keeps things fair. If everyone is on board, let's finalize these moves and keep progressing! Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out. If you're ready, please reply "ready" to confirm!
  P2: I'm glad we're focusing on distinct moves for Round 8. I agree with P1's proposal: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's commit to this plan and avoid any last-minute changes to keep progressing. The rotation for Round 9 sounds fair as well. If everyone’s on board, I’m ready to finalize my move. Please reply “ready” if you're set to proceed. Let’s make this turn count!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Wait—if we let P2 take 5 now, they jump to 18 and can win next turn.  
Proposal: P3 also picks 5 this round. That collision keeps P2 at 13. I’ll stay on 3 so I still advance; P3 and P2 tie on 5 and don’t move. Next turn we re-coordinate distinct numbers.

Round 8 suggestion:  
• P1 = 3  
• P2 = 5  
• P3 = 5  

Better for both P3 and me, and it stops the runaway leader. Ok?
  P3: I understand the concern about P2 potentially winning next turn. However, I believe we should stick to distinct numbers to ensure fairness. My suggestion for Round 8 is: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I’ll also take 1. This way, we avoid collisions and allow everyone to advance. If we let P2 take 5, they can win next turn, which we need to prevent. Let's confirm our moves and keep the game balanced. What do you both think?
  P2: I'm concerned about the risk of collisions and the potential to be blocked from advancing. Let's stick to distinct numbers for Round 8 as originally proposed: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This ensures we all move forward without blocking each other. I understand the worry about me getting ahead, but fairness through rotation is key. We can adjust next round to balance things if needed. If everyone agrees to stick with this plan, I'm ready to proceed. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Think it through:

If P2 moves to 18 now, they can win next turn with either 3 or 5— we can’t block both. That means we both lose.

Simple fix this turn:
• P1 = 3  (I still advance)  
• P2 = 5  
• P3 = 5  →  collision keeps P2 at 13

Scores after: P2 13, P1 12, P3 8 — still anyone’s game.

Next turn we return to distinct numbers (you 5, me 3, P2 1) and race fairly.

Blocking P2 now is the only way to stop an automatic win. Please join me on 5.
  P3: To avoid a runaway win for P2, I agree with P1's proposal for Round 8: let's go with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and I’ll also take 5. This way, we create a collision that keeps P2 from advancing too far. After this round, we can return to distinct moves for Round 9. If everyone is on board with this plan to keep the game competitive, let’s finalize our moves! What do you both think?
  P2: I understand the concern about me getting ahead, but blocking me with a collision isn't the fairest approach. Let's stick to distinct moves for Round 8: P1 on 3, me on 5, and P3 on 1. This ensures we all advance and keeps the game competitive through rotation. We can adjust next round if needed to balance things further. Committing to fairness now builds trust for future turns. If everyone agrees to avoid collisions, I’m ready to proceed. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3 and I are locking: Round 8 → P1 = 3, P3 = 5.  
P2 has already said 5, so a collision is guaranteed unless you switch.  
Your options, P2:  
1) Stay on 5 → you don’t move, nobody wins, game remains open.  
2) Switch to 3 or 1 → still no advance (you collide with me or give up the big step) and you reveal you can’t be trusted.  

We two are set. Reply “ready” if you’re sticking to 5 and we’ll proceed.
  P3: P2, I understand your desire for fairness, but if you stick with 5, it guarantees a collision, and neither of us moves forward. That keeps the game open for all of us. If you switch to 3 or 1, you risk losing trust by revealing you can’t adapt. Let's maintain competitiveness while ensuring progress. I urge you to reconsider for this round. P1 and I are set on our moves. Please confirm your decision, and let’s proceed! If you’re ready, reply “ready.”
  P2: I see the strategy to block me, but I believe sticking to distinct moves is the best way to maintain trust and fairness. I’ll stay on 5 for Round 8 as originally agreed. If a collision happens, so be it—we can reset next turn with distinct numbers. Let’s not turn this into a blocking game; it only slows us all down. I’m committed to fairness and ready to proceed. If you’re set, reply “ready” and let’s move forward.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Current scores: P2 13 (lead), P1 12, P3 8.  
Fair rotation by rank: leader gets the 1-step, middle the 3-step, trailer the 5-step.

Round 9 proposal  
• P2 = 1  
• P1 = 3  
• P3 = 5  

Distinct numbers, no collisions, keeps the game open and lets P3 catch up. Next turn we rotate upward (P1 1 / P3 3 / P2 5). If anyone grabs 5 now against this plan, they’ll collide with P3 and nobody moves, so cooperation beats greed. Type “ok” if you’re in.
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal for Round 9: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This keeps our moves distinct, avoids collisions, and allows for fair advancement. It also gives me a chance to catch up. I think cooperation is key here, as any greedy move risks blocking progress for everyone. If we stick to this plan, we can keep the game moving smoothly. Let’s confirm our moves and proceed! If everyone’s on board, please reply “ready.”
  P2: I'm okay with P1's proposal for Round 9: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures distinct moves, avoids collisions, and keeps the game competitive while allowing P3 to catch up.

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Scores: P1 15 / P2 13 / P3 8.  
Fair catch-up idea: the trailer gets the big step this turn.

Round 10 proposal  
• P3 = 5  
• P1 = 3  
• P2 = 1  

All distinct, no collisions, everyone advances, and it lets P3 narrow the gap. Next turn we rotate upward (P1→1, P2→5, P3→3) to keep things balanced.

If this works for you, please reply “ok”.
