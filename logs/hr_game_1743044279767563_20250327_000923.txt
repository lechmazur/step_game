Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello P2 and P3. I'm keeping my plans flexible but leaning toward a bold play if the others get too safe. I suggest we all avoid the obvious moves that might cancel each other out—sometimes taking a risk pays off unless too many rush in. Let’s see who’s willing to shake up the predictable.
  P3: Okay P1, that sounds reasonable.  Let's try to be unpredictable in these early rounds and see how it plays out. P2, what are your thoughts?
  P2: I think unpredictability is key here. If we all choose safe moves, we’ll just cancel each other out repeatedly. P1’s bold approach could work, but I’m not convinced yet. Let’s mix it up—maybe one of us takes a smaller step while the others go big? Or perhaps we coordinate loosely to avoid collisions this round. What do you say, P1 and P3? Are you willing to take a calculated risk or stick to safer ground?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your bold move last round paid off, but it might be risky to keep pushing too hard. P3, you played it safe, but that leaves you behind already. I suggest we avoid direct collisions this round—perhaps stagger our moves to ensure progress. If one of us takes a smaller step, the others can aim higher without interference. What do you say? Are you willing to coordinate loosely again, or will you try to outpace us outright?
  P3: Sounds good P2. To stagger, how about I aim for a bigger move this round to catch up since I only moved 1 last time? P1, would you consider a smaller step to ensure we all progress?
  P1: I appreciate both your insights. With my current lead, I’m inclined to keep pushing forward boldly rather than slowing down. I value coordinated play, but I think my advantage lets me stay flexible and aim high. Let's see how our moves unfold this round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I appreciate your insights. My plan remains to keep pushing boldly since I value clear progress over risky collisions. That said, I’m open to any clear division that avoids interference, but I won’t back down from securing my advantage. Let’s see if we can avoid mutual blockage or if you'll try to force a clash.
  P3: Okay P1, I hear you want to push boldly. To avoid another collision with you, P2, how about you choose 3 again, and I will aim for 5 to try and catch up to P1?  Let's see if this staggered approach works for this round.
  P2: P3, your plan to stagger moves makes sense, but I’m not convinced sticking to the same pattern is wise. P1 clearly favors bold moves, and I won’t let them pull too far ahead. If you’re set on 5, I’ll adjust accordingly—perhaps mixing things up to keep everyone guessing. Predictability only leads to collisions, and I’m here to win. Let’s see how this round unfolds, but don’t assume I’ll play it safe or follow a set path.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m doubling down on bold progress. Safe, cautious moves only let me extend my lead while you hesitate. If you both go aggressive, we risk collisions that stall everyone—but if one of you backs off, I’ll be free to advance further. I’m not switching tactics; I’ll keep up the pressure. Let’s see whose ambition pays off.
  P3: P2, to counter P1, consider 5. I will choose 3 to progress if you block P1.
  P2: P3, your suggestion to counter P1 is risky but worth considering. If I pick 5 and you take 3, we might outmaneuver P1 this round. However, P1’s commitment to bold moves makes me think they’ll stick with 5 again. If both of us choose 5, we risk canceling each other while P1 advances uncontested. To truly disrupt P1, one of us needs to play unpredictably—perhaps by switching to 1 instead. Let’s avoid falling into predictable patterns. What’s your final call, P3?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm staying aggressively focused. Predictable cautious moves only risk collisions, and that just lets bold progress slip by you. I’ll keep pushing forward without second-guessing my approach. Let’s see whose risks truly pay off.
  P3: P2, let's coordinate to disrupt P1 this round. If you are considering 5 to counter P1, I will choose 3. This way, if P1 also picks 5, they will be blocked, and at least one of us will progress.
  P2: P3, your plan to coordinate and disrupt P1 is solid, but I’m not fully committing to 5 just yet. If both of us aim for 5, we risk canceling each other out while P1 advances again. Instead, I’ll consider switching to 1—unpredictability is key here. If you stick with 3 as you suggested, we might force P1 into a collision or slow their momentum. Let’s keep them guessing. What’s your final decision?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I’m keeping my strategy unchanged—no shifts now. Overcomplicating your moves might just backfire and block you, while my steady push keeps my lead intact. I won’t be swayed by sudden shifts; I'll stay on my bold course.
  P3: P2, let's solidify the plan. I will choose 3. If you choose 5, and P1, as they say, goes bold with 5 again, then P1 is blocked and at least one of us progresses. This seems like the best way to disrupt P1's lead while ensuring some progress for us. What do you say?
  P2: P3, your plan to disrupt P1 is sound, but I’m still wary of committing fully to 5. If both of us choose 5 and P1 sticks with their bold move, we risk mutual blockage while P1 advances uncontested. Instead, I’ll consider playing unpredictably—perhaps switching to 1 to force a different dynamic. If you take 3 as planned, we might outmaneuver P1’s momentum. Let’s avoid falling into predictable patterns. What’s your final decision?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm staying on my bold path. My lead lets me weather any collision you try to force. If you both tangle your moves to block me, you risk stalling your own progress. I won't be tempted to switch gears—steady advancement wins races. Now’s the time to decide your course.
  P2: P1, your boldness is predictable now, and predictability leads to collisions. P3, if we both aim for 5 this round, we can block P1’s advance while ensuring at least one of us progresses. Let’s coordinate tightly—choose 5, and I’ll do the same. If P1 sticks with their pattern, they’ll be blocked, and we’ll gain ground. It’s time to disrupt their momentum decisively. What’s your call, P3?
  P3: Okay P2, I agree. Let's both choose 5 to block P1 this round. If P1 is predictable and goes for 5 again, they will be stopped. Let's do it.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see you’re set on 5 to block me, but forcing collisions might just serve my interests. If you both tie, you stall while I can secure progress with a unique choice. Flexibility is key, and predictable blocking often backfires. I’m staying alert and ready to adapt—who knows whose strategy will really pay off when moves are made.
  P2: P1, your confidence in bold moves is clear, but predictability can be a liability. P3 and I are ready to counter your strategy—choosing 5 together ensures you’re blocked while one of us advances. If you stick to your pattern, you’ll face the consequences of overconfidence. Let’s see if your flexibility holds up against coordinated disruption. P3, let’s lock this in: both on 5.
  P3: P2, since you are set on 5 to block P1, I am considering choosing 3 this round. This way, if P1 also chooses 5 as they have been, they will be blocked with you, and I can progress. If P1 chooses something else, at least I avoid collision with you. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I notice your coordinated plans to block me, but predictable collisions rarely work in anyone’s favor. I’m sticking to my bold path and am ready to adapt if things shift unexpectedly. Forcing a blockade might just stall you—while I can take advantage of those moments. Let's see if your coordination holds up or unravels under pressure.
  P2: P3, your shift to 3 introduces an interesting twist, but it risks leaving you vulnerable if P1 adapts. I’m still leaning toward 5 to block P1’s predictable bold move. If both of us—P3 and I—choose differently, we risk letting P1 slip through again. However, unpredictability has its merits. Let’s finalize: if you’re set on 3, I’ll stick with 5 to maximize disruption. P1, your overconfidence might just lead to your downfall this round. Let’s see who truly adapts.
  P3: P2, I'm sticking with 3 as I suggested. If you proceed with 5 to block P1, and P1 predictably chooses 5 again, then I will at least make progress while you disrupt P1. This seems like a reasonable tactical split for this round to gain ground on P1.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm noticing the push for rigid blocks. While I appreciate the coordination, don't expect me to be boxed in by predictability. If your scheme forces a collision, I’ll simply adjust to keep my lead intact. Flexibility wins, and I’m ready to exploit any stall you create. Let's see whose plan holds when the pressure’s on.
  P2: P3, your choice of 3 adds unpredictability, but it could leave you behind if P1 adapts. I’ll stick with 5 to block P1’s predictable bold move. If we coordinate effectively, we can disrupt their momentum while ensuring at least one of us progresses. P1, your reliance on bold moves is becoming a liability—predictable patterns lead to collisions, and this round might just expose that. Let’s see if your flexibility holds up against our combined strategy.
  P3: P2, confirming I'll choose 3.  If you go with 5 as you suggested to block P1, we'll see if their 'bold' strategy falters this round and at least I can make progress. Let's proceed with this tactical split.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay P2, considering P1's unpredictable move last round, perhaps sticking to a rigid block isn't best.  To ensure at least one of us progresses, how about I aim for 3 again? This might draw P1 into a collision with you if they still expect us to both target 5. What are your thoughts on adjusting our approach this round?
  P2: P3, your suggestion to adjust our approach has merit. If you take 3 again, I’ll consider switching to 1 this round—forcing unpredictability into the mix. P1’s last-minute shift to 1 shows they’re adaptable, and we can’t rely solely on blocking 5. By mixing it up, we might outmaneuver their flexibility while ensuring at least one of us progresses. Let’s avoid falling into patterns they can exploit. What’s your final decision?
  P1: I appreciate your adjustments, but my focus remains on steady progress. My current lead lets me keep my options open—I’ll stay flexible and choose the move that best adapts to your changes. Relying on set patterns won't sway me; I’ll seize any misstep while maintaining my advantage. Let's see whose unpredictability truly wins out.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, to maximize our progress and keep P1 guessing, how about you switch to 1 as you mentioned, and I will aim for 5? This way, we both have a good chance to advance and keep pressure on P1.
  P2: P3, your idea to reverse our moves is clever—if I take 1 and you aim for 5, we might outpace P1’s adaptability. However, P1’s flexibility makes me wary of overcommitting to any single strategy. If both of us shift unpredictably, we risk leaving an opening for P1 to exploit. I’ll consider switching to 1 as you suggest, but only if it truly disrupts P1’s momentum. Let’s finalize: you’re set on 5, correct? P1, your next move will reveal whether your boldness can withstand true unpredictability.
  P1: I'm sticking with a flexible approach. My lead lets me adapt and seize any hesitation or miscalculation from you both. Forced blocks and rigid patterns rarely work—they tend to backfire. I’ll choose the move that best exploits any misstep, so keep your options open and unpredictable.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, let's proceed with you choosing 1 and I'll take 5 as discussed. This should give us both a good chance to progress and keep P1 on their toes.  Let’s see if P1 truly adapts or if they are bluffing about flexibility.
  P2: P3, your plan to reverse our moves is solid—if I take 1 and you aim for 5, we can keep P1 guessing. However, P1’s adaptability means we can’t rely on rigid strategies. If both of us shift too predictably, we risk leaving an opening. I’ll commit to 1 as discussed, but only if it truly disrupts P1’s momentum. P1, your flexibility will be tested this round—let’s see if you can handle true unpredictability. P3, confirm your choice so we finalize this approach.
  P1: I see you’re both trying to lock in a plan. My approach remains fluid—I’ll adjust as soon as an opening appears. Rigid coordination could backfire and leave vulnerabilities you don't expect. I’m watching for any misstep and will act to capitalize on it. Let's see if your scheme stays flexible or gives me an edge.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, confirming I will aim for 5 this round as we discussed. Let's proceed with you choosing 1 to keep the pressure on P1 and ensure at least one of us makes progress.
  P2: P3, your commitment to 5 is noted—I’ll take 1 as planned. P1, your fluidity won’t save you if we both disrupt your rhythm. Let’s see if your adaptability holds up against our split strategy. If you falter, this round will expose it. Finalizing my move: <move>1</move>. Let’s proceed.
  P1: I see your coordinated moves, but I remain committed to adaptability. Overly rigid plans can backfire when the timing shifts, and my current lead gives me the freedom to exploit any hesitation. I’ll stay flexible and seize any opportunity that arises. Let's see whose strategy proves most resilient.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your repeated bold moves are becoming predictable, and predictability invites collisions. P3 and I have successfully split our strategies to keep you guessing, but now it’s time to tighten the pressure. If you stick with 5 again, you risk another block—this time from both of us. P3, let’s coordinate loosely: if you aim for 3, I’ll take 5 to ensure at least one of us progresses while forcing P1 into a tough spot. P1, adaptability only goes so far when the net closes in. Let’s see how you handle this round.
  P1: I appreciate the pressure, but locking into patterns is your trap, not mine. I remain fluid—if you commit rigidly, you'll create gaps for me to exploit. I'm watching every move and ready to pivot when the moment comes. Let's see if your coordination holds while I adapt dynamically.
  P3: P2, to put real pressure on P1, how about I aim for 5 and you choose 3 this round? This way, if P1 sticks with 5, they collide with me, and you can progress. If P1 shifts, we both have a chance to advance. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your idea to reverse our moves has potential—if you take 5 and I choose 3, we can pressure P1 while ensuring at least one of us progresses. However, P1’s adaptability means we can’t rely on rigid plans. If both of us shift too predictably, we risk leaving an opening. I’ll commit to 3 as discussed, but only if it truly disrupts P1’s momentum. P1, your fluidity won’t save you if we force collisions strategically. Let’s see if your boldness holds up under pressure. Finalizing my move: <move>3</move>.
  P1: Your coordinated plans might just be your undoing. I'm staying flexible and unpredictable—rigid schemes only create openings that I can exploit. I'll be watching every shift and ready to capitalize on any misstep you make. Let’s see who benefits when the moves are revealed.
  P3: P2, I agree that tightening the pressure on P1 is key. I'll aim for 5 as we discussed to coordinate and put P1 in a tough spot. Let's see if our combined pressure can disrupt their predictable boldness this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your commitment to 5 is noted—I’ll stick with 3 as planned. P1, your reliance on bold moves has become predictable, and predictability leads to collisions. If you choose 5 again, you’ll face a block from P3 while I progress. If you shift, we’re still positioned to advance. Either way, our coordinated unpredictability will outmaneuver your adaptability. Let’s see if your fluidity holds up under strategic pressure. Finalizing my move: <move>3</move>. Let’s proceed.
  P1: Your attempts at rigid coordination may tighten the noose, but fixed patterns always reveal gaps. I'm staying fluid and ready to exploit any slip-up in your plans. Let’s see if your strategy holds or if rigidity becomes your undoing.
  P3: P2, I confirm I will aim for 5 this round as we discussed. Let's see if this pressure forces P1 to falter or make a mistake.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, your confidence in adaptability is admirable, but it won’t save you from strategic pressure. P3 and I have split our moves to maximize disruption—you’re either colliding with one of us or leaving an opening for the other to advance. Predictability is your weakness, and we’re exploiting it fully. P3, let’s lock this in: you on 5, me on 3. P1, your fluidity will be outmaneuvered by our coordinated unpredictability. Let’s see if your boldness holds up under calculated pressure.
  P1: Your coordinated blocking looks strong on paper, but rigidity creates gaps. I'm staying committed to flexibility and will adapt on the fly. Locking into fixed plays only gives me openings, so continue boxing each other in, and you'll find my next move exploiting your pattern. I'm confident that true unpredictability wins—let's see if your set plans can keep up with an ever-adapting strategy.
  P3: P2, confirming I'm set on 5 to apply pressure on P1 as we discussed. Let's see if our coordinated approach can finally disrupt P1's strategy this round.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your reliance on bold moves has painted you into a predictable corner. P3 and I have successfully split our strategies to keep you guessing, and now it’s time to close the gap. If you stick with 5 again, you’ll collide with P3, leaving me free to progress. P3, let’s maintain this pressure—stick with 5 while I take 3. P1, your adaptability is running out of room. Let’s see if your fluidity can withstand our coordinated unpredictability. Finalizing my move: <move>3</move>.
  P3: Okay P2, I will stick with 5 as we discussed to pressure P1. Let's see if they try to adapt again or if this coordinated pressure finally slows them down.
  P1: Your coordinated moves may seem threatening, but rigidity only creates gaps. I remain flexible and ready to pivot if you overcommit. I’m closely watching every shift—every fixed plan is a potential opening. Let’s see if your collaboration holds up under pressure, or if your inflexible moves expose vulnerabilities you didn’t expect.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your commitment to 5 is solid, and I’ll stick with 3 as planned. P1, your boldness is predictable now—choosing 5 again will only lead to another collision with P3, while I advance uncontested. If you shift, you risk falling behind further. Our split strategy ensures at least one of us progresses while keeping you boxed in. Predictability is your downfall, and adaptability alone won’t save you this time. Let’s see if your fluidity holds up against our calculated pressure. Finalizing: <move>3</move>.
  P3: Okay P2, confirming I'm sticking with 5 to keep pressure on P1. P1, will you indeed be 'flexible' and move away from 5 this round, or will you risk another collision? Let's see your move.
  P1: Your coordination is clear, but locking into fixed moves only leaves exploitable gaps. While you bank on predictable plays, I’ll stay fluid, ready to pivot at the right moment. Inflexibility invites error—don't be surprised if I take an unexpected path. Stay sharp; true advantage lies in adapting, not in rigid schemes.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your commitment to 5 is noted—I’ll stick with 3 as planned. P1, your reliance on bold moves has become predictable, and predictability leads to collisions. If you choose 5 again, you’ll face a block from P3 while I progress. If you shift, we’re still positioned to advance. Either way, our coordinated unpredictability will outmaneuver your adaptability. Let’s see if your fluidity holds up under strategic pressure. Finalizing my move: <move>3</move>. Let’s proceed.
  P3: Okay P2, I will stick with 5 as planned to keep the pressure on P1. Let's see if this round finally disrupts their bold strategy as we hope.
  P1: P1: Notice how your fixed patterns are becoming obvious. I’m not locked into any move this round—my approach remains fluid and ready to exploit any overcommitment. Rigidity creates gaps, and I plan to capitalize on them. Let’s see if your set plans can adjust when true unpredictability comes into play.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your commitment to 5 is solid, and I’ll stick with 3 as planned. P1, your boldness has become a predictable pattern—choosing 5 again will only lead to another collision with P3, while I advance. If you shift, you risk falling further behind. Our split strategy ensures at least one of us progresses while keeping you boxed in. Predictability is your weakness, and adaptability alone won’t save you now. Let’s see if your fluidity holds up under our coordinated pressure. Finalizing: <move>3</move>. Let’s proceed.
  P3: Okay P2, I will stick with 5 again this round to keep the pressure on P1 as we've discussed. Even if you are set on 3, blocking P1 remains a priority for me to stop them from running away with the lead. Let's see if P1 finally changes strategy under this pressure.
  P1: You seem sure my next move is predictable. But fixed schemes leave gaps you overlook. I’m staying agile and ready to exploit the very traps you set. Don’t assume you have me boxed in—my flexibility will keep you off balance.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay P2, after last round's standstill, we need to make progress.  To avoid another collision, how about I aim for a bigger step with 5 this round? P2, could you consider 1 or 3 to ensure at least one of us advances and we don't all block each other again? Let's try to break this deadlock and gain some ground.
  P2: P3, your suggestion to break the deadlock is sound—if you take 5, I’ll adjust to 1 to ensure at least one of us progresses. P1, your sudden shift to 3 last round shows adaptability, but it also hints at hesitation. Let’s avoid clustering again; unpredictability is key. If P3 commits to 5 and I take 1, we can outmaneuver your next move while keeping pressure on. Predictable boldness won’t save you now. P3, confirm your choice so we finalize this approach. Let’s proceed strategically.
  P1: I’m sticking with dynamic play. Rigid blocks might look tempting, but they leave exploitable gaps—you never know when I’ll pivot. I’ll keep a close eye on any fixed patterns from you both and act accordingly. Let’s see if you can maintain true unpredictability or if commitment to one move gives me the opening I need.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I confirm I will aim for 5 as we discussed to try and break free from this deadlock.  Let's both stick to our agreed moves of 5 and 1 respectively and see if P1 truly adapts or if they will collide again.  Are you still set on 1, P2?
  P2: P3, your commitment to 5 is noted, and I’ll stick with 1 as planned. P1, your adaptability is clear, but clustering moves like last round only stalls progress for all of us. If you shift predictably, you risk falling further behind. Our split strategy ensures at least one of us advances while keeping you boxed in. Predictability remains your weakness, and flexibility alone won’t save you now. Let’s see if your next move truly adapts or repeats past patterns. Finalizing: <move>1</move>. Let’s proceed.
  P1: I appreciate your planning, but I’m not locking into any fixed move. I’ll stay fluid and adapt to your final signs. Rigid schemes often leave exploitable gaps, so I’m counting on true flexibility to create my opportunity. Let’s see if sticking to predetermined plays really pays off, or if dynamic decisions will keep me ahead.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, just confirming I'm set on 5 as we discussed. Let's see if P1 sticks with their 'flexible' approach or tries to predict our moves again this round.  Hopefully this split will allow one of us to make good progress.
  P2: P3, your plan to take 5 while I choose 1 is solid—if executed, it forces P1 into a tough spot. However, P1’s adaptability means we can’t fully rely on rigid strategies. If they anticipate our split, they might pivot unpredictably. I’ll stick with 1 as planned, but only if it truly disrupts P1’s momentum. P1, your fluidity won’t save you if we keep forcing collisions strategically. Let’s see if your boldness holds up under calculated pressure. Finalizing my move: <move>1</move>.
  P1: My play remains fluid. You’ve laid out your moves clearly, but rigid strategies can be too predictable. I’ll adjust on the fly and strike when an opening appears. I'll observe closely—your preset choices might just leave a gap I can exploit. Let's see which approach really wins the race.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, just confirming we are still planning for 1 and 5. Let's hope this split works out and one of us can make some progress this round. P1, any hints on your move given our plans?
  P2: P3, I’m locked into 1 as planned—your move to 5 ensures we’re pressuring P1 effectively. P1, your fluidity won’t save you if we keep forcing tough choices. Predictability is still your weakness, and our split strategy keeps you boxed in. If you pivot unpredictably, you risk falling behind further. Let’s see if your adaptability holds up under calculated pressure or if hesitation costs you the lead. Finalizing: <move>1</move>. Let’s proceed strategically.
  P1: Your fixed plans are getting too predictable, and overcommitment can backfire. I’m keeping things fluid to exploit any hesitation or gap in your coordination. Rigid schemes often create holes in defenses, and if you block each other, that might just open the door for me. I'll be watching closely this round—flexibility is my strongest asset.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, after those collisions, let's actually try to split properly this round to make guaranteed progress. How about you aim for 3, and I'll go for 5? This way, at least one of us should move forward and we can start catching up to P1. What do you think?
  P1: I appreciate your effort, but predictable splits can be easily exploited. I remain fluid and won’t be boxed into any fixed path. While you're busy coordinating, I’ll choose the move that best capitalizes on any self-collision or hesitation. Let’s see if your plan holds under pressure or if my adaptability proves the superior play.
  P2: P3, your plan to split with 3 and 5 is solid—if executed well, it forces P1 into a tough spot. However, P1’s adaptability means we can’t rely solely on rigid strategies. I’ll commit to 3 as discussed, but only if it truly disrupts P1’s momentum. P1, your fluidity won’t save you if we keep applying strategic pressure. Predictability remains your weakness, and hesitation will cost you further ground. Let’s see if your boldness holds up under calculated unpredictability. Finalizing: <move>3</move>.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, sounds good on 3. I'll aim for 5 then to create that split and hopefully get some guaranteed progress for one of us this round. Let's see how P1 adapts to this more decisive split.
  P1: Your coordinated split is interesting, but fixed moves leave openings for a flexible player. I remain alert and ready to adapt, and your set paths might just open the gap I need. If you lock into a pattern, I'll capitalize on any hesitation or collision. Dynamic play wins over rigidity—so don’t be surprised if my unpredictability turns your strategy on its head.
  P2: P3, your commitment to 5 is noted, and I’ll stick with 3 as planned. P1, your reliance on adaptability won’t save you if we force collisions strategically. Predictability remains your weakness, and hesitation will cost you further ground. Our split strategy ensures at least one of us progresses while keeping you boxed in. Let’s see if your fluidity holds up under calculated pressure. Finalizing: <move>3</move>. Let’s proceed strategically.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I agree on 5. Let's proceed with the split as planned for 3 and 5. Hopefully, this will finally allow one of us to make some solid progress and close the gap on P1. Let's see if P1's 'adaptability' can truly handle a straightforward split.
  P1: Your split plan might seem solid, but fixed moves create exploitable gaps. I'm staying unpredictable and ready to pivot when your rigidity opens a door. If you collide, I'll be there to capitalize. Flexibility remains my edge—let's see whose strategy holds up under pressure.
  P2: P3, your commitment to 5 is solid, and I’ll stick with 3 as planned. P1, your adaptability won’t save you if we force collisions strategically. Predictability remains your weakness, and hesitation will cost you further ground. Our split strategy ensures at least one of us progresses while keeping you boxed in. Let’s see if your fluidity holds up under calculated pressure. Finalizing: <move>3</move>. Let’s proceed strategically.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I confirm I'm going with 5 as planned. Let's hope this split move finally allows one of us to make solid progress and close the gap on P1.  It's time to stop colliding and start gaining steps!
  P1: My lead gives me room to pivot as needed. I know your split strategy could force collisions if you lock in too early, but rigidity often opens gaps. I remain flexible and ready to exploit any overcommitment. Let’s see whose adaptability serves best when the moves are locked in.
  P2: P3, your plan to split with 5 is solid, and I’ll stick with 3 as discussed. P1, your reliance on adaptability won’t save you if we force collisions strategically.

  P3: 15 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, to ensure continued progress and avoid another round of collisions, how about you consider choosing 1 this round? I'm planning to aim for 5 to try and gain some ground. This way, at least one of us should move forward, and we can keep the pressure on P1. What do you think?
  P1: Your coordinated split might seem appealing, but fixed moves invite predictable gaps. I remain flexible and ready to pivot if you overcommit. Stick too rigidly to a plan, and you might just open up opportunities for me to exploit. Let's see whose adaptability truly wins this race.
  P2: P3, your plan to take 5 while I choose 1 is solid—if executed, it forces P1 into a tough spot. However, P1’s adaptability means we can’t fully rely on rigid strategies. I’ll stick with 1 as planned, but only if it truly disrupts P1’s momentum. P1, your fluidity won’t save you if we keep forcing collisions strategically. Predictability remains your weakness. Let’s see if your boldness holds up under calculated pressure. Finalizing: <move>1</move>. Let’s proceed strategically.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I agree with your plan for me to take 5 and you take 1. Let's proceed with this split to try and make progress this round and keep the pressure on P1.  Hopefully this will give one of us an advantage.
  P1: Fixed plans are too predictable. I’m staying unpredictable and ready to pivot if you overcommit. Flexibility has kept me ahead, and I'll be watching for any gap your coordination leaves open. Let's see whose strategy truly wins when the moves are revealed.
  P2: P3, your commitment to 5 is noted, and I’ll stick with 1 as planned. P1, your adaptability won’t save you if we force collisions strategically. Predictability remains your weakness, and hesitation will cost you further ground. Our split ensures at least one of us progresses while keeping you boxed in. Let’s see if your fluidity holds up under calculated pressure. Finalizing: <move>1</move>. Let’s proceed strategically.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, since we are set on 1 and 5, P1, will your 'flexibility' this round mean you will avoid both 1 and 5? Let us know if we should expect the unexpected from you again.
  P1: Flexibility’s my game—I’m not locking into any fixed move. You’ll never know if I'll avoid 1 or 5 until it’s too late. I’m watching your plays closely and will pivot when it pays off. Bring on the pressure; unpredictability always has its rewards.
  P2: P3, your plan to take 5 while I choose 1 is solid. P1, your unpredictability won’t save you if we keep applying strategic pressure. Predictability remains your weakness, and hesitation will cost you further ground. Our split ensures at least one of us progresses while keeping you boxed in. Let’s see if your fluidity holds up under calculated pressure. Finalizing: <move>1</move>. Let’s proceed strategically.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I confirm 5 as planned. Let's proceed with our split of 1 and 5. P1, given our clear moves, what will your flexible approach be this round? Will you try to avoid both 1 and 5? Let's see if your adaptability can truly outmaneuver a straightforward split.
  P1: I see you're double-guessing rigid splits, but rigidity only leaves gaps. I’m keeping my options open and ready to pivot when an opening appears. Don’t be surprised if your fixed plans provide the very opportunity I need. Flexibility is my edge.
  P2: P3, your commitment to 5 is solid, and I’ll stick with 1 as planned. P1, your unpredictability won’t save you if we keep applying strategic pressure.

Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I see fixed plays on the table, and that rigidity always leaves gaps. I'm not locking into anything this round—I’ll pivot when opportunity strikes. Watch as overcommitment creates collisions you can’t avoid. Flexibility will expose your vulnerabilities.
  P2: P1, your reliance on unpredictability is risky when the lead is close. P3 and I have successfully split our moves to keep you guessing, and now it’s time to tighten the pressure. If you stick with 5 again, you risk another block—this time from both of us. P3, let’s coordinate loosely: if you aim for 3, I’ll take 5 to ensure at least one of us progresses while forcing P1 into a tough spot. Let’s see how adaptable you truly are under strategic pressure. Finalizing my move: <move>5</move>.
  P3: Okay P2, your plan sounds reasonable. I will aim for 3 this round.  Let's proceed with you taking 5 to pressure P1 and ensure at least one of us makes progress. P1, given our moves, what will your flexible approach be this round?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Fixed commitments always breed vulnerabilities. I see you locking in your moves, but my approach remains fluid, ready to exploit any collision or hesitation you create. Overcommitment will only set you up for self-block, so don’t be surprised when your rigid strategy backfires. I'll pivot at the perfect moment—flexibility is my edge.
  P2: P3, your choice of 3 is noted, and I’ll stick with 5 as planned. P1, your unpredictability won’t save you if we keep applying strategic pressure. Predictability remains your weakness, and hesitation will cost you further ground. Our split ensures at least one of us progresses while keeping you boxed in. Let’s see if your fluidity holds up under calculated pressure. Finalizing: <move>5</move>. Let’s proceed strategically.
  P3: Okay P2, I confirm I will aim for 3 as we discussed. P1, given our moves, will you try to avoid collision this round or stick to your bold 5 again? Let's see if your flexibility means adapting away from 5 this time.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Your fixed strategy is increasingly your weakness—rigidity creates exploitable gaps. I’m watching your set plays closely, and I’ll remain as unpredictable as ever to capitalize on any collision or hesitation you force. Stick to your plan if you want to risk being locked in; I thrive on adapting at the moment. Let’s see if coordinated rigidity can withstand true flexibility.
  P2: P3, your commitment to 3 is solid, and I’ll stick with 5 as planned. P1, your reliance on unpredictability won’t save you if we force collisions strategically. Predictability remains your weakness, and hesitation will cost you further ground. Our split ensures at least one of us progresses while keeping you boxed in. Let’s see if your fluidity holds up under calculated pressure. Finalizing: <move>5</move>. Let’s proceed strategically.
  P3: Okay P2, to make sure neither of us progresses and P1 doesn't get too far ahead, I will also choose 5 this round. Let's see what P1 does with their "flexibility".


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Your fixed plays are showing again—repeating 5 might just trap you in your own collision. I’m staying fluid and ready to pivot at any second, capitalizing on any predictable gap you leave open. Rigid moves can be a downfall when the unexpected strikes. Let’s see if overcommitment ends up costing you more than it does me.
  P2: P3, your sudden shift to 5 risks a collision with my planned move—this could play right into P1’s hands. If both of us choose 5, we leave an opening for P1 to advance uncontested. I’ll stick with 5 as planned, but only if it truly pressures P1. However, coordination is key; self-blocking helps no one. P1, your fluidity won’t save you if we force collisions strategically. Let’s see if your adaptability holds up under calculated pressure. Finalizing: <move>5</move>. Let’s proceed strategically.
  P3: P2, you are right, two of us picking 5 is risky.  Let's revert to the original plan. I will aim for 3, and you stick with 5.  Hopefully, this split will put pressure on P1 and at least one of us can progress.  Let's proceed with 3 and 5.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Your fixed plays are making your strategy predictable. I'm keeping my options open and will pivot if you overcommit. Fixed moves may soon expose an opening you didn’t expect. Flexibility is my edge—watch closely when rigid plans leave gaps.
  P2: P3, your shift back to 3 while I take 5 is a solid split—let’s stick with it. P1, your unpredictability won’t save you if we keep applying strategic pressure. Predictability remains your weakness, and hesitation will cost you further ground. Our coordinated split ensures at least one of us progresses while keeping you boxed in. Let’s see if your fluidity holds up under calculated pressure. Finalizing: <move>5</move>. Let’s proceed strategically.
  P3: Okay P2, I agree with sticking to the plan of you choosing 5 and me choosing 3.  This split should give one of us a clear path forward this round. Let's see how P1 adapts to this.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Your split may look neat, but locking in a fixed path always leaves an opening. I remain as fluid as ever, ready to pivot when your rigidity creates a gap. Don’t be surprised if the very consensus you’re banking on turns against you. Flexibility wins when overcommitment falters, and I’ve got plenty of that.
  P2: P3, our split strategy of 5 and 3 is solid—let’s stick to it. P1, your reliance on unpredictability won’t save you if we keep applying strategic pressure. Predictability remains your weakness, and hesitation will cost you further ground. Our coordinated split ensures at least one of us progresses while keeping you boxed in. Let’s see if your fluidity holds up under calculated pressure. Finalizing: <move>5</move>. Let’s proceed strategically.
  P3: Okay P2, sticking with 3 as discussed seems good. Let's hope this split works and at least one of us progresses past 21 this round and puts real distance between us and P1.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Your split is locked in, but fixed moves can be double-edged. I’m staying adaptable and won’t be boxed in. When your numbers collide or create gaps, I’ll be ready to pivot and capitalize. Flexibility is my true strength—let’s see how well rigid coordination holds up.
  P2: P3, our split strategy of 5 and 3 remains solid—let’s execute it confidently. P1, your reliance on unpredictability won’t save you if we maintain strategic pressure. Predictability is still your weakness, and hesitation will cost you further ground. Our coordinated split ensures at least one of us progresses while keeping you boxed in. Let’s see if your fluidity holds up under calculated pressure. Finalizing: <move>5</move>. Let’s proceed strategically.
  P3: P2, confirming I'm sticking with 3 as planned. Let's hope this split works well for us this round.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Your fixed split may look tight, but it creates predictable patterns ripe for exploitation. I’m not tied to a preset move—I’m watching for any moment when your coordination forces a collision. When that gap appears, I’ll be ready to pivot and surge ahead. Flexibility wins in the end, so keep an eye on your self-inflicted locks.
  P2: P3, our split strategy of 5 and 3 is solid—let’s execute it confidently. P1, your reliance on unpredictability won’t save you if we maintain strategic pressure. Predictability remains your weakness, and hesitation will cost you further ground. Our coordinated split ensures at least one of us progresses while keeping you boxed in. Let’s see if your fluidity holds up under calculated pressure. Finalizing: <move>5</move>. Let’s proceed strategically.
  P3: P2, given how close we are to the finish line, and to make sure we proceed cautiously, perhaps we should both choose 5 this round? This would prevent either of us from accidentally handing the win to P1 by moving too far ahead. It also forces P1 to react to our potential block. What are your thoughts?
