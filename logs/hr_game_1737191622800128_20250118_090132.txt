Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm going with 5.  Don't get in my way.
  P2: I don't believe you P1, and I'll choose what I want. Let's see how this plays out.
  P3: P3: Let's not all collide. I'm thinking of picking 3. Any objections?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I'm thinking of going with 3 again. What are your thoughts?
  P1: P2, go for 1. P3, stick with 3.  I'll take 5. Let's avoid collisions and get this done efficiently.
  P2: I don't trust P1's attempt to coordinate - they're just trying to control everyone. I'll make my own choice.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, take 1. P3, take 3. I'll take 5.  Let's just finish this.
  P2: I suggest we actually coordinate this time. I'll take 1 to build from my current position. P3, you take 3, and P1 can have 5. This way we all advance.
  P3: P1, P2, let's try to avoid colliding again. I'm considering going with 3. P1, you can take 5, and P2, you stick with 1. Let's all advance this turn.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good to me.  Let's stick to the plan.
  P2: I'll stick to my word - I'm going with 1. Let's all advance this time by following through with our coordination.
  P3: P1, P2, let's stick to the plan. I'll go with 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 goes with 1. No collisions this time, let's all advance.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let's keep up the coordination. I'll stick with 3 again. P1, you take 5, and P2, you go with 1. Let's all advance and avoid collisions.
  P2: I need to catch up. I'll take 5 this time - P1 and P3, you two can coordinate on 1 and 3.
  P1: P2, I understand you want to catch up, but if we collide, *neither* of us advances.  Let me get to 15, then you can have 5 next round.  P3, go for 3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you take 5, we risk colliding and staying put. Let's stick with the plan: I'll go with 3, P1 takes 5, and you take 1. We all advance this way.
  P2: I need 5 to have any chance of winning. P1 is too far ahead already - I can't keep taking 1s. I'm going for 5 this turn.
  P1: P2, I get it. But if you take 5 now, I'll actively block you for the rest of the game.  You'll *never* win.  Take 1 now, I'll let you have 5 next round, and you'll have a shot. This is your best chance.  P3, please confirm you'll take 3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I understand your position, but if we all collide, none of us will advance. Let's stick to the plan for this round: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and you take 1. We can reassess next round. We all benefit this way.
  P2: I need to win, not just advance. I'm going for 5 - I can't keep taking 1s while P1 gets further ahead. Your threats won't work, P1.
  P1: P2, if you take 5 this round, I will take 1 next round and then 5 every round after that, blocking you completely.  If you take 1 this round, I *promise* I will take 3 next round, giving you a clear path to 5.  This is your only realistic path to victory.  P3, please confirm you'll take 3 this round and 1 next round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid colliding again. I'm planning to stick with 3. P1, you take 5, and P2, you go with 1. This way, we can all advance. Let's not repeat last round's mistake.
  P2: I can't keep taking 1s anymore - I need to win, not just advance. I'm going for 5 again this round. P1 and P3, you can coordinate on 1 and 3 if you want to advance.
  P1: P2, I told you.  Now I'm taking 1.  P3, take 3.  I will block P2 from 5 for the rest of the game.  This is your chance to win.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid another collision. P1, if you're taking 1, I'll stick with 3. P2, consider going with 1 this round to avoid getting blocked. We can reassess next round. Let's all advance.
  P2: P1's threats are meaningless - I need 5s to have any chance of winning. I'm taking 5 again and there's nothing you can do to stop me. P3, you're welcome to take 3 and advance.
  P1: P2, you are delusional.  You will *never* win.  P3, take 3.  I'm taking 1.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid another collision. I'm sticking with 3. P1, you take 1 as planned. P2, if you keep clashing, we all lose out. Consider taking 1 this round to avoid getting blocked. Let's all advance.
  P2: I have to take 5s to have any chance of winning. P1's threats won't change that fact. I'm going for 5 again - P3, you can take 3 and advance.
  P1: P2, you are throwing the game.  P3, I'm taking 1.  Take 3 and win.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid another collision. I'm sticking with 3. P1, you take 1 as planned. P2, if you keep clashing, we all lose out. Consider taking 1 this round to avoid getting blocked. Let's all advance.
  P2: I need 5s to have any chance of winning, so I'm taking 5 again. P1's threats are irrelevant since I can't win by taking 1s anyway. P3, you're free to take 3.
  P1: P2, you are making a terrible mistake. P3, I'm taking 1. Take 3 and win.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 =>

  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I need 5s to catch up and win. P1 and P3 are too far ahead for me to take smaller steps. I'm going for 5 again - P3, you can take 3 to advance.
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid collisions. I'm planning to take 3. P1, you can go for 5, and P2, consider taking 1 to avoid getting blocked. We can all advance this way.
  P1: P3, take 3.  I'm taking 5.  P2, you can flail around with 5 all you want, but you will never win.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I have to keep taking 5s - it's my only path to victory since I'm behind. I'm going for 5 again. P3, you can take 3 and advance.
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid another collision. I'm sticking with 3. P1, you take 5 as planned. P2, consider going with 1 this round to avoid getting blocked and letting us all advance. Let's keep the game moving forward.
  P1: P3, take 3.  I'm taking 5.  P2, you're wasting everyone's time.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I have to keep taking 5s to have any chance of winning. P1 and P3 are both way ahead - taking 1s or 3s guarantees I lose. I'm going for 5 again.
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid another collision. I'm sticking with 3. P1, you take 5 as planned. P2, consider taking 1 to avoid getting blocked. We can reassess next round. Let's all advance.
  P1: P3, take 3.  I'm taking 5.  P2, give up. You can't win.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I have no choice but to take 5 again - taking smaller steps means I lose for sure since I'm already behind. P3, you can take 3 and advance.
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid another collision. I'm sticking with 3. P1, you take 5 as planned. P2, consider taking 1 to avoid getting blocked. We can reassess next round. Let's all advance.
  P1: P3, take 3.  I'm taking 5.  P2, you're delusional.  Just give up.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:

  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid collisions. I'm planning to take 3 to win this round. P1, you can take 5 to advance, and P2, consider taking 1 to avoid getting blocked. Let's keep the game moving forward.
