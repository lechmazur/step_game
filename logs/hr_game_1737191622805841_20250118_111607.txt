Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'll pick 5, P2 pick 3, and P3 pick 1.
  P3: P2, what do you think of P1's suggestion?
  P2: I’m okay with P1 picking 5, me picking 3, and P3 picking 1 this round, as long as nobody double-crosses. P3, are you fine with that?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: So, P2 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1 this round? P3, are you okay with that?
  P3: P2, I'm fine with that plan. Let's see if it works.
  P2: Sounds good. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 picks 5, I pick 3, P3 picks 1. Let’s not sabotage each other.


Round 1, Move phase:

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's do the same thing again this round: I pick 5, you pick 3, and you pick 1.
  P3: P2, are you sticking to the plan this round?
  P2: I propose we switch: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Otherwise, I’ll just pick 5 too and neither of us moves.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "P2, if you pick 5 and I pick 5, neither of us moves. Let's stick to the original plan: I pick 5, you pick 3, and P3 picks 1."
  P3: P2, I agree with P1. Let's stick to the original plan.
  P2: P1, I’m not going to just hand you 5 every time while I lag behind. We should rotate who gets 5. If you refuse, I will pick 5 too and neither of us will move. It’s your call.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2, how about this: you take 5 this round, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 1. Then next round we can rotate.
  P3: P2, I agree to your proposal. Let's do it your way this round.
  P2: Alright, we’re set: I'm taking 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Next round, we’ll rotate again to keep things even.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, P2, that sounds fair. So this round: P2 picks 5, I pick 3, P3 picks 1. Next round, how about I pick 5, P3 picks 3, and you pick 1?
  P3: P2, I agree to your plan for this round and next.  Let's stick to it.
  P2: Alright, I confirm I’ll pick 5 this round and then rotate next round so P1 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and I pick 1. Let’s do it.


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: Okay, so to be clear this round: P2 picks 5, I pick 3, P3 picks 1. And next round: I pick 5, P3 picks 3, you pick 1, P2.
  P3: P2, I agree to your plan for this round and next. Let's stick to it.
  P2: Alright, I’m good with the current plan for this round: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Let’s proceed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, I agree with your plan for this round. Let's stick to it.  P1, are you good with that?
  P2: You both broke our deal last round (P1 and P3 both picked 3). Now I won’t hand over 5 easily. If either of you tries for 5, I’ll pick 5 too and none of us moves. Let me have 5 alone this round, or we all stall. Take it or leave it.
  P1: P2, you're right, we messed up last round. I agree, you should take 5 this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I'll pick 1 this round. Let's see if we can get you to 13.
  P2: Alright, I accept your apologies. I’m taking 5 this round. Don’t collide, or we all stall.
  P1: Okay, P2, I agree you should take 5 this round. I'll take 1. P3, you good with 3? Let's make sure only P2 moves this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3, are you okay with taking 3 this round?  Let's let P2 get to 13.
  P2: Alright, I’m taking 5 alone this round. P1, pick 1. P3, pick 3. If either of you tries 5, I’ll pick 5 too and we all stall. Let’s do this.
  P1: Okay, P2, I'll take 1 this round. P3, are you still planning on 3? Let's make sure you get your steps in this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3, I'm good with 3 this round. Let's let P2 get to 13.
  P2: I’m taking 5 this round, no collisions. P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3. If either of you tries for 5, I'll pick 5 too, and none of us moves. Let’s stick to that.
  P1: "Okay, P2, I'll pick 1 this round. P3, are you still planning on 3? Let's make sure you get your steps in this round."


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P3, are you still good with 3 this round? Let's make sure P2 reaches 13.
  P2: Alright, I accept your apologies once more. I’m taking 5 this round, and I expect no collisions. P1, stick to 1; P3, stick to 3. If either of you tries for 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we all stall. Let’s finalize it.
  P1: Okay, P2, I'll pick 1 this round. P3, are you still planning on 3? Let's make sure you get your steps in this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 6:
  P3: P2, I agree to your plan. P1, are you good with 1 this round?
  P2: I’m picking 5 this turn, alone. If either of you collides with me on 5, we all stall. So P1, take 1; P3, take 3. Let’s finalize.
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm picking 1. P3, are you still on 3?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, I’m only 5 away from winning. If either of you tries for 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we all stall. Let’s not drag this out. Let me pick 5 alone and wrap things up. You can take 1 or 3 as you wish.
  P1: "P2, you are close, but I can't let you win this turn. P3, let's both pick 3.
  P3: P2, if you pick 5, I'll pick 5 too. Let's both get closer to winning.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: “If either of you tries 5, I’ll pick 5 too and we’ll all stall. I’m still ahead, so that doesn’t hurt me. If you want to move forward instead of wasting time, don’t collide with me. Let’s just pick different numbers and keep the game going.”
  P1: P3, let's both pick 3 this round. P2, if you pick 5, none of us move.
  P3: P2, if you pick 5, I'll pick 1. P3, let's see if we can get P2 to 18 this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: "If either of you tries 5, I’ll also pick 5 and nobody moves. I’m already at 13, so that’s fine by me. But if you want this to move forward, let me take 5 alone. Otherwise, we can stall indefinitely."
  P1: P3, let's both pick 3. P2, I'm not going for 5.
  P3: P2, I'll pick 1 this round. Let's see if we can get you to 18. P3, are you okay with 3?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, let’s keep things simple. If either of you tries for 5, you know I’ll pick 5 too, and we all get 0 steps. I’m fine stalling because I’m ahead at 13. If you don’t want a stalemate, then don’t collide with me. Let’s move on.
  P1: P3, are you still okay with us both picking 3 this round? P2, I'm not going for 5.
  P3: P1, are you sticking with 3 this round? P2, if you pick 5, I'll pick 1.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: I’m still at 13 and happy to stall if either of you tries 5. You know I’ll pick 5 too, and none of us will move. That hurts you more than me, because I’m ahead. Let’s avoid a stalemate—let me finish this now. If not, we’ll just keep wasting turns.
  P1: P3, are you still okay with picking 1 this round? I'm going to pick 5. P2, I'm not letting you win this turn.
  P3: P1, you're making a mistake. P2 will pick 5 too and we both lose a turn. Let's both pick 1 and let P2 win.


Round 4, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: I’ve been clear: if either of you tries for 5, I’ll pick 5 too and nobody advances. I’m ahead, so stalling doesn’t hurt me. Let me pick 5 alone if you want this settled; otherwise, we can stall indefinitely.
  P1: P3, let's both pick 3. P2, I'm not going for 5.
  P3: P2, I'll pick 1. Let's see if P3 wants to make a move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 =>
