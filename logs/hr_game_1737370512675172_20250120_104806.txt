Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, let's keep it simple. If we all choose different moves, we can avoid collisions and all advance. How about P1 goes for <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>? This way, we all benefit. Thoughts?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'm considering P2's proposal, but I don't see why I should take the smallest step. Why should I be the one to take <move>1</move> and fall behind from the start? Can P2 suggest a more balanced approach or provide a reason for this distribution?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Alright, let's adjust the plan. How about P1 takes <move>3</move>, I'll take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? This way, P1 doesn't feel left behind, and we can all start progressing without collisions. If we stick to this rotation, we can all advance steadily. What do you think, P3? Are you willing to take <move>1</move> for this round?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Since P3 isn't responding, I suggest we ignore P3's choice for now. P2, are you willing to commit to the adjusted plan you proposed, where I take <move>3</move> and you take <move>5</move>, regardless of P3's action?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I'm willing to stick to our adjusted plan. I'll take <move>5</move> while you take <move>3</move>. This way, we can both advance without worrying about P3's choice. P3, if you decide to join in, taking <move>1</move> would ensure no collisions. Let's see how this round plays out.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'll take <move>3</move> as agreed with P2. I expect P2 to take <move>5</move>. P3's silence suggests unpredictability, so let's proceed with our plan and see how P3 reacts. If P3 chooses wisely, we might all advance without collisions. Let's end the conversation and proceed to the move phase.

  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given P3's unpredictable behavior, I suggest P2 and I maintain our previous agreement to avoid collisions. However, to adjust our strategy, let's consider alternating our steps to keep P3 guessing and prevent them from easily catching up. P2, are you open to discussing a rotation that keeps us ahead without making it easy for P3 to follow?
  P2: P1, I'm open to discussing a rotation. Since P3 seems unpredictable, we should consider alternating between <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> to stay ahead. How about this round, I take <move>3</move> and you take <move>5</move>? This way, we can keep P3 guessing and maintain our lead. P3, if you want to avoid collisions, consider taking <move>1</move> again. Let's see if we can all advance smoothly.
  P3: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2's suggestion to alternate steps is reasonable. To confirm, this round P2 takes <move>3</move> and I take <move>5</move>. P3, your silence makes your move unpredictable. Taking <move>1</move> again would be a safe choice to avoid collision, but it's up to you. Let's proceed with our plan and see how this round unfolds.
  P2: P1, our alternating strategy seems solid. I'll take <move>3</move> this round, and you take <move>5</move>. P3, if you want to avoid collisions and keep progressing, consider sticking with <move>1</move>. This way, we can all advance without issues. Let's see how this round plays out.
  P3: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, since P3 remains silent, let's focus on our strategy. To throw P3 off, what if we occasionally skip our agreed move and take a different step, making it harder for P3 to anticipate our actions? This unpredictability could give us an edge. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, I agree with introducing some unpredictability to our strategy. Let's occasionally switch it up to keep P3 guessing. For this round, I'll stick with <move>3</move> as planned, but in future rounds, we can decide on-the-fly to swap or change steps. P3, if you want to avoid collisions and advance, consider taking <move>1</move> again. Let's see how this round plays out.
  P3: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's finalize our moves for this round. P2, you'll take <move>3</move> and I'll take <move>5</move> as discussed. P3, your silence suggests you might take <move>1</move> again. Let's proceed with our plan and see the outcome. I'm ready to end the conversation phase.
  P2: P1, our alternating strategy is solid, but let's keep that unpredictability in mind for future rounds. For now, I'll stick with <move>3</move> as planned, and you with <move>5</move>. P3, if you want to avoid collisions, consider taking <move>1</move> again. Let's proceed and see how this round unfolds.

  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, given that P3 took <move>5</move> last round, it seems they're trying to advance quickly. To counter this, let's consider both taking <move>1</move> this round to avoid collisions and assess P3's strategy. This will keep us in the game without losing ground. P3, if you want to avoid collisions, consider choosing <move>3</move> or <move>5</move> again. Let's see how this plays out.
  P1: P2's suggestion to take <move>1</move> is cautious, but I think we should focus on gaining ground. How about we stick to our alternating pattern, ensuring we don't collide and make progress? P3's last move was aggressive, so let's be prepared to adapt after this round based on their next action.
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I see your point. Let's stick to our alternating pattern for now to maintain progress. I'll take <move>3</move> and you take <move>5</move> this round. P3, if you're aiming to avoid collisions and make strategic progress, consider choosing <move>1</move> again. This way, we can all advance without hindering each other. Let's stay flexible and adapt based on P3's actions in future rounds.
  P1: P2, since P3 remains unresponsive, let's focus on our strategy. To gain an advantage, I suggest we consider taking larger steps more frequently, while still avoiding collisions. This round, I'll take <move>5</move> as planned. Let's reassess after this round and adapt our strategy based on P3's actions.
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, let's keep advancing steadily. I'll take <move>3</move> this round, and you can continue with <move>5</move> as planned. P3, if you want to avoid collisions, consider choosing <move>1</move> again. Let's stay flexible and adapt based on P3's actions in future rounds. If P3 becomes more aggressive, we can adjust our strategy accordingly.
  P1: Let's proceed with our planned moves for this round. P2 takes <move>3</move> and I'll take <move>5</move>. P3's silence suggests unpredictability, so let's focus on our strategy. After this round, we can reassess and adjust based on P3's actions. Our goal is to stay ahead without collisions. Let's see how P3 reacts this time.
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:

  P1: P2, I'm considering deviating from our alternating pattern to gain an edge. Since P3 is far behind, I might take a larger step to increase my lead. What are your thoughts on adapting our strategy to focus on individual progress rather than just avoiding collisions?
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your desire to gain an edge, but deviating too much might lead to unnecessary collisions. Let's maintain our alternating pattern for now while staying flexible. I'll take <move>5</move> this round, and you can decide based on your strategy. P3, taking <move>1</move> would still be the safest choice to avoid collisions. Let's see how this round unfolds and adapt as needed.
  P1: P2, since P3 is significantly behind, I propose taking a larger step this round to solidify my position. I'm considering taking <move>5</move> to close the gap with you. What are your thoughts on this move, and will you stick to your planned <move>5</move> or adjust to avoid collision?
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I see your point about gaining an edge, but if we both take <move>5</move>, we'll collide and lose progress. To avoid this, I'll stick with <move>5</move> this round, and you might consider taking <move>3</move> to ensure we both advance. P3, if you want to avoid collisions and move forward, <move>1</move> is still your safest bet. Let's proceed strategically and reassess after this round.
  P1: P2, to avoid collision and gain an edge, how about I take <move>5</move> and you take <move>1</move> this round? This way, I advance significantly, and you still make progress.
