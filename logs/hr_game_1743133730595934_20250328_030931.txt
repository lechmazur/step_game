Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi everyone! Let's avoid collisions early on. I'll pick 3 this turn—please choose something else.
  P3: Hi P1 and P2! I agree with P2 about avoiding collisions. I’ll choose 1 this turn to keep things safe. Let's see if we can all make progress without blocking each other. What will you pick, P1?
  P1: Thanks for coordinating, P2 and P3. Since you're going with 3 and 1, I'll take 5 this turn. Let's all move forward without collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, looks like we're all set for this turn. If we keep communicating clearly like this, we can all advance steadily without collisions.
  P3: I appreciate the coordination, everyone! Since P1 is going with 5, I’ll stick to my plan of choosing 1. This way, we can all make progress. If we keep this strategy up, we can avoid collisions and move forward together. What do you think, P1 and P2? Are we all set for our moves?
  P1: Sounds like we’re all aligned: P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I’ll take 5. Let’s stick to that and avoid any collisions. Looking forward to seeing us all make progress this round.

  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Looks like we had a collision last round since both P1 and I picked 5. To avoid that happening again, I suggest we all pick different numbers this time. I’ll go with 1 again to keep things steady. P1, P2, what are your thoughts on your moves for this round? Let’s coordinate to ensure we all make progress without blocking each other again.
  P2: Since P3 is taking 1, I'll choose 5 this time. P1, would you like to take 3 to avoid collisions?
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3. If P3 is going with 1 and P2 is taking 5, I’m good with choosing 3 this round. Let’s stick to those choices so we can all move forward without collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Great! So just to confirm, it looks like we have our moves set: P3 is going with 1, P2 is taking 5, and P1 is choosing 3. This should help us avoid collisions and make progress. Let’s stick to these choices and see how we do this round. Looking forward to moving ahead! Are we all set?
  P2: Yes, all set! Let's stick to these choices and move forward smoothly this round.
  P1: Glad we’re aligned again this round. If we all stick to our stated moves—P3 on 1, P2 on 5, and I’ll go with 3—we should all make progress without any collisions. Let’s keep the coordination going!

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Well, it seems trust is an issue here. We all tried coordinating openly, but collisions keep happening. Let's try again—I'll pick 3 this round. If you both avoid 3, we can at least have a chance to move forward. What do you say?
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems like we’re struggling with coordination. I suggest I pick 1 again to keep things steady. P2, if you're going with 3, maybe P1 can choose 5 this time to avoid another collision. What do you both think? Let’s try to make this round work for all of us!
  P1: Thanks for the suggestions. If P2 is going with 3 and P3 is sticking to 1, I’ll take 5 this round. Let’s finally get a clean round with no collisions. Stick to your moves and we’ll all benefit.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Good, let's stick to this plan then: P3 picks 1, I'll take 3, and P1 goes with 5. No last-minute surprises this time, please. Let's move forward smoothly.
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems we have a solid plan in place for this round. Just to recap, P3 is picking 1, P2 is going with 3, and P1 will take 5. Let’s stick to this agreement to avoid any more collisions and finally make some progress. If we can all follow through, we should be able to move forward without any issues. Looking forward to seeing us all advance this time! Are we all ready to confirm our moves?
  P1: We’ve all agreed on our moves—P3 takes 1, P2 picks 3, and I go with 5. Let’s finally follow through and avoid another collision. We all need progress, so let’s make this round count. Ready to lock it in?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: All set here. Let's lock in our choices and finally make some real progress this round.
  P3: It looks like we're all set to avoid collisions this round with P3 on 1, P2 on 3, and P1 on 5. Let’s make sure we stick to our agreed moves to finally see some progress. If we can follow through, we should all advance without any issues. After this round, we might need to reassess our strategies to ensure one of us can get ahead. Ready to confirm our moves and see some movement?
  P1: Let’s finally stick to our agreed plan this time—no surprises. If we all follow through, we each make progress and break the deadlock. Let’s prove we can coordinate. Ready to move?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm ready to lock it in and move forward. Let's stick to our plan and finally break this deadlock.
  P3: I appreciate the agreement we've made for this round, and I hope we can all stick to our chosen moves: I’ll take 1, P2 is on 3, and P1 is going with 5. Let’s finally make some progress without any collisions! After this round, we may need to rethink our strategies to ensure someone can get ahead. Looking forward to seeing us all advance! Are we ready to confirm our moves?
  P1: We’ve all confirmed our moves—P3 on 1, P2 on 3, and I’m taking 5. Let’s finally follow through and avoid another collision. We all need progress, so let’s make this round count. Ready to lock it in?

  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Looks like trust has completely broken down after last round’s double-cross. If we keep colliding, no one wins. I’m proposing a reset: I’ll take 1 this round. P2, take 3. P3, take 5. Let’s try one more time to coordinate and actually move. If we all stick to it, we each gain ground. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, your proposal sounds fair to me. I'll take 3 if you stick to 1 and P3 takes 5. Let's break the cycle of mistrust and move forward this round. P3, are you on board with this reset?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the reset proposal. I’m on board with taking 5 this round. If P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3, we should all be able to advance without collisions. This could be our chance to make real progress and rebuild trust. Let’s stick to this plan and see how it plays out! Are we all in agreement?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Glad we’re all aligned. If we each follow through—me on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5—we’ll finally break the deadlock. Let’s prove we can cooperate when it counts. Ready to lock it in?
  P2: I'm ready to commit fully to this reset. Let's end the mistrust here and now—no surprises this round. If we stick to our agreed moves, we can finally make real progress. Ready to lock it in!
  P3: I appreciate the agreement we've reached so far. To recap, I’m set to take 5, P1 is on 1, and P2 is going with 3. Let's stick to this plan and finally make some progress without any collisions. If we can follow through this time, we can break the cycle of mistrust and start moving forward. Are we all ready to confirm our moves?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: We’ve all clearly agreed: I’m on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5. If we stick to this, we each finally gain ground and start rebuilding trust. Let’s not ruin it—no last-minute changes. Ready to move?
  P2: I'm fully committed to our agreed moves this round. Let's finally break this cycle of mistrust and each make progress. Ready to confirm and move forward!
  P3: I’m glad we’ve all agreed on our moves: I’ll take 5, P1 will go with 1, and P2 is set on 3. If we stick to this plan, we can finally make progress without any collisions. Let’s make this round count and rebuild some trust. Ready to lock in our choices and move forward together?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: We’ve all confirmed our choices multiple times—P1 on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5. Let’s finally follow through and prove we can cooperate. If anyone breaks this now, it’s clear they can’t be trusted going forward. Ready to move.
  P2: P1, P3, we’ve talked enough. Let's finally lock in our agreed moves and break this stalemate. No surprises—time to move forward.
  P3: I appreciate the commitment we've all shown to our agreed moves this round. Let’s stick to our plan: I’ll take 5, P1 is on 1, and P2 is going with 3. If we follow through, we can finally make progress without any collisions. Let’s not let mistrust creep in again—this is our chance to move forward together! Ready to lock in and make this round count?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Trust is clearly broken, and repeated collisions prove coordination talk means little. From here on, I’ll make my moves based on what benefits me most. If either of you wants to propose something that genuinely helps me catch up—and can be trusted to follow through—I’m listening. Otherwise, expect unpredictability.
  P2: P1, I understand your frustration. Clearly, talk has become meaningless. Here's a simple offer: you're behind at 0 steps, so pick 5 this round. I'll avoid it to help you finally advance. P3, you're slightly ahead, let's both steer clear of 5 this turn to let P1 catch up a bit. If this doesn't work, we might as well stop trying to coordinate entirely.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the willingness to help P1 catch up. However, I need to prioritize my own position. If P1 picks 5, I might have to choose 3 to ensure I make progress. P2, if you truly want to help P1, consider picking 1 instead. This way, we can avoid collisions and allow P1 to move forward. Let’s see if we can find a way to benefit all of us while being strategic. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you're ahead and still considering blocking me? That shows your priorities. P2 at least offered a fair shot for me to catch up. If you both avoid 5 this round, I’ll take it and finally move. But if either of you jumps on 5 again, I’ll assume coordination is dead and start playing purely to sabotage whoever’s ahead. Your call.
  P2: P1, your frustration is valid—you're at 0 steps. P3, you're ahead, so strategically it's in your interest to avoid collisions. I'll choose either 1 or 3 this round to clearly leave 5 open for P1. P3, if you genuinely want to avoid sabotage from P1 later, pick whichever of 1 or 3 I don't take. Let's finalize clearly: I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 5. Agreed?
  P3: P1, I understand your position, but I need to prioritize my own advancement as well. If P2 is taking 1, I’ll go with 3 to avoid blocking you. P1, if you take 5, it will help you catch up, but I also want to ensure I make progress. P2, can we agree on our moves: P1 on 5, me on 3, and you on 1? This way, we can avoid collisions and allow P1 to move forward. Let’s finalize our plan and make this round count!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: If you both actually follow through—P2 on 1, P3 on 3—I’ll take 5 and finally get on the board. But if either of you jumps on 5 again, I’ll assume you’re playing selfishly and start actively blocking whoever’s ahead. This is your last chance to prove coordination means something.
  P2: P1, your warning is clear. P3, let's finalize this openly: I'm committed to 1, you take 3, and P1 gets 5. If this fails again, we all lose from endless sabotage. Agreed?
  P3: P1, I see your frustration, and I want to avoid further collisions. I agree with your plan: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 1, and you take 5. This should allow you to finally make progress. P2, if we follow through this time, we can break the cycle of mistrust and avoid sabotage. Let’s lock in these moves and finally move forward without any issues. What do you both say? Are we ready to confirm this plan?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: If you both follow through—P2 on 1, P3 on 3—I’ll take 5 and finally get moving. Break the cycle now, or I’ll switch to pure disruption. Your move.
  P2: Everything's been said clearly. I'm locked in on 1, P3 on 3, and P1 on 5. Follow through, or we all spiral into sabotage next round. Let's move.
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate our efforts to coordinate this round. If we all stick to the plan—P2 on 1, I’ll take 3, and P1 takes 5—we can finally break the cycle and allow P1 to catch up. Let’s make this round count and avoid any last-minute changes. I believe we can rebuild some trust if we follow through. Are we ready to confirm our moves and finally see some progress?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Glad we finally had a clean round. But let’s be clear—P3 is ahead, and if we let them coast, they’ll win. I propose this: P2 takes 5 to catch up, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 1. That slows P3 slightly and helps balance the field. P3, if you’re serious about avoiding sabotage, show it by cooperating now.
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about my position, but I need to prioritize my own advancement. If P2 takes 5, I might have to go with 3 to ensure I make progress. However, I’m open to a compromise. If I pick 1, it might help balance the field and allow P2 to catch up. Let’s find a way to ensure we all benefit while still making our moves. What do you think, P1 and P2? Can we agree on a strategy that works for all of us?
  P2: P3, you're clearly leading. If you genuinely want to avoid sabotage and maintain cooperation, take 1 this round. I'll take 5 to catch up, and P1 takes 3. Any deviation shows you're playing selfishly and invites conflict. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, this is your chance to prove you're not just playing for yourself. Take 1, let P2 take 5, and I’ll take 3. That keeps things balanced and avoids sabotage. If you go for 3 or 5, you’re making your intentions clear—and I’ll respond accordingly next round. Your move.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see your points about cooperation and my position. However, I need to prioritize my own advancement. If P2 takes 5 and P1 takes 3, I’ll choose 1 to avoid blocking anyone. This way, we can all move forward without collisions. If we stick to this plan, we can maintain some balance and avoid sabotage. Let’s confirm our moves and make this round count! What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your willingness to choose 1 this round is appreciated. Let's lock this in clearly: P3 takes 1, I'll take 5, and P1 takes 3. If we all stick to this agreement, we maintain balance and rebuild trust. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed. P3 on 1, P2 on 5, I’ll take 3. This keeps everyone moving and prevents collisions. If anyone deviates, especially P3, I’ll assume cooperation is over and start actively blocking the leader. Let’s lock it in and prove we can play smart. Ready?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the agreement we’ve reached. To confirm, I’ll take 1 this round, P2 is set on 5, and P1 will go with 3. This strategy allows all of us to advance while preventing collisions. If we follow through, we can maintain balance and avoid sabotage. Let’s stick to our plan and make this round count! Are we ready to lock in our moves?
  P2: I'm fully committed to our agreed moves. Let's lock them in and show we can still cooperate effectively. Ready to move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let’s lock it in: P2 on 5, P3 on 1, I’ll take 3. This round keeps us all moving and prevents anyone from pulling too far ahead. If P3 sticks to 1 as promised, we avoid sabotage and keep the game competitive. Any deviation signals you’re playing solo, and I’ll respond accordingly next round. Ready to move?
  P3: P1 and P2, we've established a clear plan: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 3. This should help us all advance without collisions. If we stick to this agreement, we can maintain balance and avoid sabotage. Let’s lock in our moves and make this round count! Are we ready to confirm?
  P2: All set—let's lock in our moves and see some genuine progress this round. No last-minute changes. Ready to move forward.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it looks like we're all close in steps, and I understand the need to balance the game. For this round, I suggest I take 1 again to keep things steady. P1, you might consider taking 3, and P2 could go with 5 to avoid collisions. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. What do you both think? Let's keep the momentum going!
  P1: P3, your proposal mirrors last round’s plan, which worked—so I’m willing to go with 3 again. But let’s be honest: if either of you deviates now, especially P2 at 10 steps, it shows you’re aiming to pull ahead. I’ll stick to 3 if P2 confirms 5 and P3 stays on 1. One misstep, and I’ll switch to blocking the leader next round. Confirm?
  P2: P1, P3, I agree. I'll take 5 again this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 stays on 1. We had a clean round last time; let's maintain this momentum. Deviating now would only trigger sabotage and hurt everyone's chances. Let's lock it in clearly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate our agreement to maintain momentum. I’ll stick to my plan of picking 1 this round, as it seems to be the best strategy for keeping things steady. P1, if you choose 3 and P2 takes 5, we should all advance without collisions. Let’s confirm our moves and ensure we can keep progressing together. Remember, any deviation could lead to sabotage, and we all want to avoid that. Are we ready to lock in our choices?
  P1: We’re all aligned again: P3 on 1, P2 on 5, and I’ll take 3. If we stick to this, we all move forward without conflict. But let’s be clear—any deviation now, especially from P2 or P3, will be taken as a declaration of self-interest, and I’ll respond accordingly next round. Let’s lock it in.
  P2: Agreed, let's lock it in clearly: P3 takes 1, I'll take 5, and P1 takes 3. Deviating now would only sabotage your own chances. Ready to confirm and move forward?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate our agreement to keep moving forward. I’ll stick to my plan of picking 1 this round. P1, if you choose 3 and P2 takes 5, we should all advance without collisions. Let’s confirm our moves and ensure we can keep progressing together. Remember, any deviation could lead to sabotage, and we all want to avoid that. Are we ready to lock in our choices?
  P1: We’re all close now—every move matters. I’m sticking to 3 as agreed, but let’s be clear: if either of you jumps off plan, especially P2 on 5, I’ll treat it as a push for the win and start blocking whoever’s ahead. Cooperation only works if it’s mutual—no surprises. Ready to lock.
  P2: Fully agreed—no surprises. We're all too close to risk sabotage now. Let's lock in our agreed moves and keep the momentum going. Ready to confirm.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate our commitment to cooperation. I’m still planning to take 1 this round to maintain balance. P1, if you stick to 3 and P2 takes 5, we can all advance without collisions. However, let’s be clear: any deviation from this plan will be seen as self-serving, and I’ll have to adjust my strategy accordingly. Let’s keep the momentum going and prove we can work together! Are we ready to lock in our moves?
  P1: We’re all within 2 steps—anyone can win with the right sequence. I’m sticking to 3 as agreed, but if either of you breaks the plan now, it’s clear you’re gunning for the win alone. I’ll respond by blocking the leader every round after. Stick to P2 on 5, P3 on 1, and we all move. Final chance to prove trust matters.
  P2: We're at a critical point—let's keep our word and stick to the agreed moves. Any deviation now will trigger immediate sabotage, and none of us wants that. Locking in: P3 on 1, P1 on 3, me on 5. Confirmed and ready.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, clever move—but now you're clearly in the lead. P3, we can't afford to let P1 run away with the game. Let's coordinate carefully this round to prevent P1 from pulling further ahead. I'm open to suggestions on how we can best do that.
  P1: P2, P3 — I made my move because trust was already broken. But I’m still open to coordination if it’s fair. If you both want to avoid letting me win, propose a plan that doesn’t just block me but also lets you both advance. Otherwise, I’ll keep playing to win, and that means making unpredictable moves or targeting whoever’s ahead. Your move.
  P3: P1, I appreciate your willingness to consider cooperation, but your last move shows you're focused on winning at all costs. P2 and I need to strategize effectively to prevent you from pulling ahead. I suggest that P2 takes 5 this round, while I take 1. This way, we can keep you in check and potentially catch up. If P1 sticks to 3, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s confirm a plan that balances our positions while preventing you from gaining too much ground. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your suggestion is sensible. I'll take 5 this round, you take 1, and P1 takes 3. P1, if you're truly open to fair coordination, this is your chance to demonstrate it. Deviating now would make you the clear target for blocking in future rounds. Let's lock this in and maintain balance.
  P1: I’m good with that plan: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, I take 3. It lets everyone advance and keeps things competitive. But let’s be clear—if either of you jumps on 3 or 5 to block me while benefiting yourself, I’ll take that as a declaration of war and start blocking whoever’s ahead every round. Stick to the deal, and we all move. Your call.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate our willingness to work together. Let's confirm our plan: P2 on 5, P3 on 1, and I’ll take 3. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. If we stick to this agreement, we can maintain balance and keep the game competitive. Remember, any deviation could lead to sabotage, and we all want to avoid that. Are we ready to lock in our moves and move forward together?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm ready to lock in clearly: I'll take 5, P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. Let's all stick to this and avoid further sabotage. Any deviation now will only escalate tensions and hurt everyone's chances. Ready to confirm?
  P1: We’ve all agreed: P2 on 5, P3 on 1, I take 3. This keeps us balanced and avoids collisions. If either of you breaks the plan, I’ll assume you’re playing solo and respond by blocking the leader every round going forward. Let’s keep it clean—confirm and commit.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate our willingness to coordinate this round. Let’s stick to our agreed plan: P2 takes 5, I’ll take 1, and P1 takes 3. This allows us all to advance without blocking each other. If we follow through, we can maintain balance and keep the game competitive. Remember, any deviation could lead to sabotage, and we all want to avoid that. Are we ready to lock in our moves and move forward together?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm ready to lock in our agreed moves: I'll take 5, P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3. Let's move forward without further surprises.
  P1: We’ve all confirmed: P2 on 5, P3 on 1, I take 3. This is balanced and lets everyone advance. I’m holding to it—but if either of you deviates, especially to block me while helping yourself, I’ll switch to full sabotage mode next round. Stick to the plan, or prepare for disruption. Final chance to prove trust matters.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate our agreement to coordinate this round. Let's stick to the plan: P2 takes 5, I’ll take 1, and P1 takes 3. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other and keep the game competitive. Remember, any deviation could lead to sabotage, and we all want to avoid that. If we follow through, we can maintain balance and continue making progress. Are we ready to lock in our moves and move forward together?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you're slightly ahead now at 16 steps, I'm at 15, and P3 is behind at 11. If we collide now, P3 gets a chance to catch up. Let's avoid that. I propose clearly: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. P3, this is your chance to catch up a bit. If we stick to this, we all advance without collision. Agreed?
  P1: P2, your proposal is fair and keeps us all moving. I’ll take 1 this round if P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 5. P3, this setup helps you catch up while avoiding collisions. If either of you deviates, especially to block me, I’ll shift to targeting the leader every round. Let’s keep it clean—confirm and commit.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the proposal to keep the game moving. If we stick to P1 on 1, P2 on 3, and me on 5, we can avoid collisions and allow P2 to catch up a bit. However, I want to emphasize that if either of you deviates from this plan, I will have to reassess my strategy in future rounds. Let's work together to ensure we all advance without any issues. Are we ready to lock in these moves?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you're currently behind, so this round benefits you most. Confirm clearly that you'll take 5, and we can all make progress without collisions. Let's lock this in and keep the balance.
  P1: P3, this round benefits you most—5 gets you back in the game. I’m on 1, P2’s on 3. If you stick to 5, we all move and avoid collisions. But if either of you jumps on 1 or 3, I’ll assume you’re trying to block me and will respond accordingly next round. Let’s keep it clean. Confirm?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the agreement to help me catch up. I'm on board with the plan: I'll take 5 this round, P1 on 1, and P2 on 3. This way, we can all advance without collisions. However, let’s be clear: if either of you deviates from this plan, I will have to adjust my strategy in future rounds. Let’s confirm our moves and keep the game moving forward without any issues. Are we ready to lock this in?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your confirmation is clear. I'm fully committed to our agreed moves—I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and you take 5. If anyone deviates now, it'll only lead to sabotage and hurt everyone's chances. Let's lock this in and move forward without issues.
  P1: We’re all aligned—P1 on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5. This round benefits everyone without collisions. If we all follow through, we stay competitive and keep trust alive. But let’s be clear: any deviation now will be seen as a play for solo advantage and will trigger immediate retaliation. Let’s lock it in and move.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the agreement we've reached. If we all stick to the plan—P1 on 1, P2 on 3, and I’ll take 5—we can avoid collisions and allow for progress. This round is crucial for maintaining our competitive edge. However, let's be clear: any deviation will force me to reassess my strategy in future rounds. Are we ready to confirm and lock in these moves? Let's keep the momentum going!


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: We're all clearly set—no more talk needed. Let's lock in our agreed moves and keep things fair for everyone.
  P1: We’re all locked in—P1 on 1, P2 on 3, P3 on 5. This round helps everyone without giving any single player a runaway lead. If we stick to it, we stay competitive and avoid sabotage. Any deviation now will be seen as a clear betrayal and will be met with full retaliation. Let’s move clean and keep this game fair. Ready.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate our agreement to keep the game moving. I’m set to take 5 this round, while P1 goes with 1 and P2 takes 3. This plan allows everyone to advance without collisions and keeps the competition alive. Let’s confirm our moves and ensure we all benefit from this round. Remember, any deviation will be seen as a threat to our cooperation. Are we ready to lock this in and move forward?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3—we're all within striking distance now. One collision could decide the game. Let's coordinate carefully: I'll choose 1 this round. P1, you take 5, and P3, you take 3. Everyone advances, and we avoid handing anyone the win. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, your proposal to have me take 3 while you both choose 1 and 5 is interesting. However, I need to ensure my position remains strong. I suggest I take 1 this round, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. If we stick to this plan, we can avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. What do you think? Let’s confirm our moves and make this round count!
  P1: P3, your counterproposal benefits you most—you're behind and want 1 again to avoid risk. But P2 is now in the lead, so blocking them matters most. I’m fine taking 5, but only if P2 confirms 1 and you take 3. That slows P2 slightly and keeps us all in play. Final chance to keep things fair—confirm or expect disruption.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your point about me leading is valid. I'm willing to compromise: I'll take 1 this round to slow myself slightly and show good faith. P1, you take 5 as you suggested, and P3 takes 3. This way, we all advance without collisions, and it prevents anyone from pulling too far ahead. Confirm clearly, and let's lock this in.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the discussion so far. However, I need to prioritize my position as well. I propose that I take 3 this round, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. If we stick to this plan, we can maintain balance and keep the game competitive. Let’s confirm our moves and ensure we all benefit from this round. Are we ready to lock this in?
  P1: P3, your latest proposal—P2 on 1, me on 5, you on 3—is fair and keeps things balanced. I’m on board with that. P2, if you’re serious about not running away with the lead, confirm you’ll take 1. If either of you jumps on 5 or 3 to block or surge ahead, I’ll treat it as a solo play and respond accordingly next round. Let’s keep it clean and competitive—confirm and commit.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3—I'm fully committed to our agreed moves: I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. Let's lock this in and avoid any last-minute surprises. Ready to confirm and move forward.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we’re all close in steps, and this round is crucial. I’m willing to stick to the agreed plan: P2 on 1, I’ll take 3, and P1 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. However, let’s be clear—any deviation from this plan will be seen as self-serving, and I’ll have to adjust my strategy accordingly. Let’s confirm our moves and keep the game competitive! Are we ready to lock this in?
  P1: We’re all set: P2 on 1, P3 on 3, I take 5. This keeps us collision-free and competitive. If either of you deviates, especially to block or jump ahead, I’ll treat it as a clear break from cooperation and shift to full sabotage next round. Let’s keep it clean—final chance to show we can finish this game fairly. Confirm and commit.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: We're all clearly committed. Let's lock it in and finish this round cleanly—no surprises. Ready to move forward.
  P3: P1 and P2, it’s clear we’re all very close in steps, and this round is crucial. I agree with the plan: P2 takes 1, I’ll take 3, and P1 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without collisions and maintain a competitive balance. However, let’s be clear: any deviation from this plan will be seen as self-serving, and I’ll have to adjust my strategy accordingly. Let’s confirm our moves and keep the game fair! Are we ready to lock this in?
  P1: We’re all locked in: P2 on 1, P3 on 3, I take 5. This keeps the game tight and fair. Any deviation now—especially from P2 trying to stretch the lead—will be seen as a solo push and I’ll respond accordingly. Let’s finish this round clean and competitive. Ready to move.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your attempt to grab 5 last round was risky and cost both you and P1 progress. I'm now closest to the finish line at 19. If either of you tries to block me, you risk handing the other player the game. Let's keep it simple: I'll take 3 this round. P1, you take 1, and P3 takes 5. We each advance without collision, and the game remains competitive. Deal?
  P1: P2, you're at 19—just 4 away from winning. If we let you take 3 uncontested, you could win next round. I suggest this instead: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. That slows your pace slightly while keeping everyone moving. If you reject this and still go for 3, I’ll assume you’re pushing for the win and will coordinate with P3 to block you next round. Let’s keep it competitive and fair.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the urgency in this round. P2, you're close to winning, but if we let you take 3, you could secure it next turn. I propose this: I take 5 to ensure I advance, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This way, we can all move forward without collisions, but it also keeps the game competitive. If P2 deviates from this plan, it could lead to immediate blocking next round. Let's agree on a strategy that keeps us all in the game! What do you both think?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your proposal makes sense—I'm willing to compromise. I'll take 1 this round, you take 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps the game balanced and prevents collisions. But be clear: any deviation from either of you will force me to reconsider cooperation next round. Let's lock this in and keep the competition fair.
  P1: P2, thanks for accepting the compromise—P2 on 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. This keeps us all in the game and avoids giving anyone a clear win path. P3, this setup benefits you most—you get 5 and close the gap. If either of you jumps on 3 or 5, I’ll assume it’s a solo push and respond by blocking the leader every round after. Let’s keep it clean and competitive. Confirm?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the urgency in this round with P2 so close to winning. To keep the game competitive, I’m willing to go with the plan: P2 takes 1, I’ll take 5, and P1 takes 3. This way, we all advance without collisions, and it prevents P2 from winning next turn. However, if either of you deviates from this agreement, I’ll have to reassess my strategy going forward. Let’s confirm and keep the game fair! Are we ready to lock this in?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3—I'm fully committed to our agreed plan: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps the game balanced and prevents collisions. Let's lock this in clearly and avoid any last-minute surprises. Ready to confirm?
  P1: P3, you've confirmed the plan—P2 on 1, me on 3, you on 5. This round gives you the biggest boost and keeps P2 from winning next turn. If we all follow through, the game stays balanced. But if either of you jumps to block or grab extra ground, I’ll shift to full disruption mode next round. Let’s prove we can finish this competitively and cleanly. Ready to lock.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the cooperation we've established. To keep things competitive, I suggest we stick to the plan: P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P1 takes 3. This way, we all advance without collisions, and it prevents P2 from winning next turn. If we follow through, we maintain balance and keep the game fair. Let’s confirm our moves and make this round count! Are we ready to lock this in?


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: All points made clearly—I'm locked into the agreed plan: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. No last-minute changes or surprises. Let's move forward cleanly and keep the competition fair. Ready to confirm and lock in.
  P1: We’re all clearly locked in: P2 on 1, P3 on 5, I take 3. This round keeps everyone in the game and avoids giving P2 a win path next turn. If anyone deviates—especially to grab 3 or block—I’ll treat it as a solo push and shift to full sabotage mode. Let’s prove we can finish this competitively and cleanly. Ready to move.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the urgency this round with P2 so close to winning. I’m willing to stick to our agreed plan: P2 takes 1, I’ll take 5, and P1 takes 3.

If we follow through, we can keep the game fair. Are we ready to lock in our moves?

  P3: 21 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're at a critical point with all of us so close to the finish. I suggest we keep the game competitive: I can take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure no one gets a clear advantage. If we stick to this plan, we all have a chance to advance. Let’s confirm our moves and keep the game fair! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, you're at 21—any uncontested move could win it for you. P2 and I are tied at 20. If we let you take 3 or 5, you likely win. Here's the only fair path: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. That gives us all a shot next round. If either of you jumps to grab the win now, I’ll block the leader relentlessly. Confirm or prepare for disruption.
  P2: P1, your plan makes sense. P3 must take 1—any other choice is an immediate grab for victory. I'll take 3, you take 5. If anyone deviates, it's clear sabotage, and they'll be blocked relentlessly. Confirm clearly, and let's lock this in.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency of this round. However, if I take 1, I risk falling behind while you both advance. I propose we stick to the plan: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This keeps the game competitive and allows us all to advance without collisions. If either of you deviates from this plan, it could lead to immediate blocking in future rounds. Let's confirm and keep the game fair! Are we ready to lock this in?
  P1: P3, you’re at 21—if you take 3 or 5, you win. The only fair move is 1. P2 and I both agreed: I take 5, P2 takes 3, you take 1. That gives all of us a shot next round. If you break this, I’ll block you every turn until the end. Final warning—confirm or face sabotage.
  P2: P3, your only acceptable move is 1. Any attempt at 3 or 5 is clearly aiming for an immediate win, forcing me and P1 to block you relentlessly next round. P1 and I are confirmed: P1 takes 5, I take 3, you take 1. Lock it in clearly or prepare for sabotage.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about my position. However, I still believe that if I take 1, it puts me at risk of falling behind while you both advance. If we stick to the plan where I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5, we can all move forward without collisions. This keeps the game competitive for everyone. Let’s confirm this plan and avoid any last-minute changes that could lead to sabotage. Are we ready to lock in our moves?
  P1: P3, you’re dodging a clear commitment. You’re at 21—any move above 1 wins you the game. If you truly want fair play, lock in 1 now. P2 and I are aligned: P2 on 3, I’m on 5. If you go for 3 or 5, it’s a blatant win grab, and I’ll block you every round until the end. Final chance to prove you’re not playing solo. Confirm 1, or prepare for sabotage.
  P2: P3, your hesitation is suspicious. You're clearly positioned to win if you pick anything other than 1. If you don't explicitly confirm you'll take 1, I'll assume you're going for the immediate win, and I'll coordinate fully with P1 to block you every round afterward. Last chance—confirm clearly or face consequences.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency, but I still feel that taking 1 puts me at a disadvantage. If we want to keep the game competitive, I suggest we confirm: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without collisions. If I take 1, I risk falling behind, and I want to ensure we all have a fair chance to win. Let’s confirm this plan and move forward together. Are we ready to lock it in?
  P1: P3, stop dodging. You’re at 21—if you take 3 or 5, you win. The only fair and competitive move is 1. P2 and I are aligned: P2 takes 3, I take 5, you take 1. If you pick anything else, it’s a clear solo win attempt, and I will block you every round until the end. Confirm 1 now—no more vague deflections.
  P2: P3, you've stalled repeatedly. Confirm clearly now—will you take 1 or not? Any other choice is an attempt at immediate victory, and P1 and I will both block you relentlessly afterward. Last chance to explicitly confirm your move.
