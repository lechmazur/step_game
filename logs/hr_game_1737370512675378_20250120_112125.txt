Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: How about ensuring we don’t collide? If we each pick a different number, everyone gets some steps. For instance, P1 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 5. Deal?
  P1: I propose a rotation system for our move choices to ensure fairness. Here's how it would work:

- Turn 1: P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 3, P3 chooses 1.  
- Turn 2: P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 5.  
- Turn 3: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 5, P3 chooses 3.  
- Then repeat the cycle.  

This way, each of us gets a chance to take bigger steps without any one person always getting the advantage. What do you think?
  P3: I'm not sure about the rotation system, P1. It feels a bit rigid. P2's idea of choosing different numbers each round is good, but we should decide who picks what each turn. How about this turn, P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I like the idea of picking different numbers each turn to avoid collisions. For this turn, let’s do P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. If that works for everyone, we’ll proceed and see how it goes. Then we can discuss future turns after we see what happens this round.
  P1: To ensure a coordinated and collision-free progression in the game, I propose the following rotation system for our move choices:

- **Turn 1:** P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, P3 chooses 5.

- **Turn 2:** P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, P3 chooses 1.

- **Turn 3:** P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3.

- **Repeat this cycle** in subsequent turns.

This system allows each player to benefit from different step sizes over time, promoting fairness and efficiency in advancing towards the goal of 22 steps. By adhering to this rotation, we minimize the risk of collisions and ensure continuous progress for all players.
  P3: Okay, I'm fine with P1's rotation system. Let's try it. So, this turn, P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We messed up by colliding last time, P3. Let’s avoid repeating that. This round, I suggest that I pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. That way, we each move forward without blocking one another. Afterwards, we can discuss a rotation or another approach. What do you say?
  P3: Okay, P2, I agree we need to avoid collisions. I'm fine with your suggestion for this round: you pick 5, P1 picks 1, and I pick 3. Let's make sure we all stick to it this time. After this round, we can discuss a longer-term strategy.
  P1: **Final Decision:** Pick 1  
**Final Move:** <move>1</move>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good. I’ll stick to our plan: P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P3 picks 3. After this turn, let’s see how the situation looks and decide our next moves. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: Okay, I'm still on board with the plan for this round: P2 picks 5, P1 picks 1, and I pick 3. Let's ensure we all follow through this time to avoid another collision.
  P1: **Final Decision:** Pick 1  
**Final Move:** <move>1</move>


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Great, let’s stick to the plan and avoid collisions this time. P1 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and I’ll go for 5. I’m looking forward to seeing us all advance smoothly. Let’s finalize this approach, and then we can talk long-term strategy next round. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: Okay, everyone seems to agree on the plan for this round: P2 picks 5, P1 picks 1, and I pick 3. Let's do it. After this round, we should definitely discuss a longer-term strategy to avoid future collisions and ensure we all make progress.
  P1: "Alright, I think we should stick to the plan for this round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 3. This should allow us to move forward without any collisions. After this round, let's discuss a longer-term strategy to optimize our progress towards 22 steps. It's crucial that we coordinate effectively to avoid wasting turns due to collisions. What do you both think?"

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **Final Decision:** Pick 3  
**Final Move:** <move>3</move>
  P2: Since P1 is going with 3, how about I pick 5 and you, P3, choose 1 so nobody collides? That way we all keep moving forward. What do you think? We can finalize soon and avoid wasting this round.
  P3: Okay, P2, I agree with your suggestion. I'll pick 1, you pick 5, and P1 is going with 3. Let's make it happen this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **Final Decision:** Pick 3  
**Final Move:** <move>3</move>
  P2: I see P1 is settling on 3 this round. Let’s finalize our plan so nobody collides: I’ll go for 5, and you, P3, pick 1. That way we all keep moving forward. Agreed?
  P3: Okay, I'm still on board with P2's suggestion: I pick 1, P2 picks 5, and P1 is picking 3. Let's go with that for this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **Final Decision:** Pick 3  
**Final Move:** <move>3</move>
  P2: I’ll stick to the plan of me choosing 5, P1 taking 3, and P3 going with 1. After this round, maybe we can discuss a consistent rotation or another method to avoid future collisions and keep everyone moving. Let’s finalize this now and see how it plays out. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: Okay, sounds good. Let's stick to the plan: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I pick 1. After this round, we should definitely discuss a long-term strategy.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m glad we’re moving forward without too many collisions. Let’s keep it up. For this round, how about P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1? That should keep us all advancing. After this turn, we can rotate to ensure fairness. What do you think?
  P3: Okay, P2, I'm fine with that plan for this round: P1 picks 3, you pick 5, and I pick 1. Let's stick to it and then discuss a rotation after this turn.
  P1: "So, to sum it up, I propose that we try to plan our moves in advance for the next few rounds and consider a strategy that allows us to reach 22 steps together without colliding too often. What do you both think?"


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m on board with one more round of P1 picking 3, me picking 5, and P3 picking 1. After that, I suggest we map out a rotation for the next few rounds so nobody repeatedly gets stuck picking 1. We’ll all move faster that way. What do you think?
  P3: Okay, I agree with the plan for this round: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I pick 1. Let's do it. After this round, we should definitely discuss a long-term rotation strategy.
  P1: **Final Decision:** Pick 3  
**Final Move:** <move>3</move>


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let’s finalize this round with P1 picking 3, me picking 5, and P3 choosing 1. Next time, we should agree on a clear rotation in advance so everyone gets a chance to move quickly without collisions. We can work out a fair system in the next conversation. Agreed?
  P3: Okay, I'm still on board with the plan: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I pick 1. Let's do it. After this round, let's finalize a long-term rotation strategy as we've discussed.
  P1: **Final Decision:** Pick 5  
**Final Move:** <move>5</move>

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **Final Decision:** Pick 1  
**Final Move:** <move>1</move>
  P2: P1 has declared 1, so let’s avoid collisions by having me choose 5 and you, P3, pick 3. That way, we all move forward again. What do you both think?
  P3: Okay, P2, I agree with your suggestion. I'll pick 3, and you pick 5. Let's do it this round. We should definitely work out a rotation after this.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **Final Decision:** Pick 3  
**Final Move:** <move>3</move>
  P2: Let’s finalize the plan for this round: P1 picks 1, I’ll pick 5, and P3 picks 3. Then we can discuss a rotation next time to keep everyone moving without collisions. Agreed?

  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, let's try this: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5 this round. Then we absolutely need to decide on a rotation system next round. We've wasted too many turns colliding.
  P2: Alright, I’m fine with that plan this round. I’ll choose 3, P1 can go with 1, and P3 takes 5 so we avoid collisions. Next turn, we really should finalize a predictable rotation so nobody keeps getting stuck or risks colliding unexpectedly. Let’s confirm quickly and move forward.
  P1: **Final Decision:** Pick 1 (for Round 6)

**Final Move:** <move>1</move>


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, I agree with the plan for this round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. Let's make sure we all stick to it. After this round, we absolutely need to finalize a rotation system to avoid these constant collisions.
  P2: I’m ready to finalize this round with me picking 3, P1 choosing 1, and P3 taking 5. Next turn, let’s lock in a firm rotation so collisions are minimized and everyone can advance efficiently. Are we all set on that?
  P1: **Final Decision:** Pick 1 (for Round 6)

**Final Move:** <move>1</move>


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, I'm still on board with the plan for this round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. Let's do it. After this round, we MUST finalize a rotation system.
  P2: I confirm our plan for Round 6: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. Next turn, let’s finally establish a clear rotation so we avoid collisions and keep advancing. Any thoughts on a simple, repeating pattern?
  P1: **Final Decision:** Pick 1 (for Round 6)

**Final Move:** <move>1</move>


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We keep colliding and wasting turns. Let’s lock in a three-round rotation that avoids overlap and repeats:

• Round 7: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3  
• Round 8: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1  
• Round 9: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5  

Then repeat. This guarantees each of us shares the 5, 3, and 1 slots fairly and avoids collisions, speeding us all forward. Shall we finalize this plan?
  P1: **Final Decision:** Pick 1 (for Round 7)  
**Final Move:** <move>1</move>
  P3: Okay, P2, I agree with that rotation plan. Let's lock it in. So this round, P1 picks 1, you pick 5, and I pick 3. Then we follow the rotation you proposed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Perfect. Let’s finalize our rotation starting now:  
• This turn (Round 7): P1 picks 1, I pick 5, P3 picks 3.  
• Next turn (Round 8): P1 picks 5, I pick 3, P3 picks 1.  
• Round 9: P1 picks 3, I pick 1, P3 picks 5.  
Then we repeat. This should keep collisions at zero while letting all of us advance. Agreed? If so, let’s lock it in and move on.
  P1: **Final Decision:** Pick 1 (for Round 7)  
**Final Move:** <move>1</move>
  P3: Okay, I agree with the rotation plan P2 proposed. Let's stick to it: this round, P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I pick 3. Then we follow the rotation. Let's make it happen.

  P2: I’m ready to stick to our rotation this round: P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and P3 picks 1. Let’s follow through so we all keep advancing smoothly. Do you both agree, or is there anything else to discuss before finalizing?
  P1: "Any thoughts or concerns before we finalize our moves?"


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, I agree with the rotation. This round, P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I pick 1. Let's stick to it.
  P2: I’m totally on board with the rotation for this round: P1 chooses 5, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 1. Let’s finalize it and move ahead. Then, in Round 9, we’ll stick to P1 picking 3, I pick 1, and P3 picks 5. Following this pattern consistently should help us all keep moving without collisions. Are we good to lock it in now?
  P1: Alright, I think it's important that we stick to the rotation plan we've agreed upon. For this round, according to the rotation, I should pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. Let's make sure we all stick to this to keep moving forward efficiently.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, I agree with the rotation plan. This round, P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I pick 1. Let's stick to it.

  P3: 12 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, let's stick to the rotation. This round, P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I pick 5. Then we repeat the cycle. Let's keep it smooth and consistent.
  P1: **Final Decision:** Pick 3 (for Round 9)  
**Final Move:** <move>3</move>
  P2: I’m happy to continue with our agreed rotation. Let’s finalize the plan this round: P1 takes 3, I’ll take 1, and P3 takes 5. Then we repeat the sequence next turn to keep everyone advancing without collisions. Does that work for both of you? If so, let’s lock it in now.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, I agree with the rotation. This round, P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I pick 5. Let's stick to it. Then, we repeat the rotation.
  P1: "Maybe P2 can pick 5 steps this round to reach 23 steps and win the game, while P3 and I pick 3 and 1 respectively to avoid overlapping. What do you both think about this strategy?
  P2: I’m open to P1’s suggestion. If I take 5 this round, I’ll reach 23 and win, but only if we avoid any collisions. P3, would you agree to pick 1 instead, so we don’t clash? P1 can stick with 3. Let me know your thoughts, and we can finalize.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, I'm fine with P2 picking 5 to win. I'll pick 1 this round, and P1 can pick 3 as suggested. Let's do it.
  P1: "Maybe we can think about a scenario where we all have a chance to win, not just P2. What do you both think about continuing the rotation and see who reaches 22 first naturally, without any one person trying to rush ahead?"
  P2: I understand wanting a fair race, but I’m just one step away from winning if I can safely pick 5. That’s the nature of the game—we’re all trying to be first across 22. If you both allow me to pick 5 without colliding, it’ll be a clean finish this round. Let’s do that: I’ll pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. Then we see what happens next.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 13 steps
