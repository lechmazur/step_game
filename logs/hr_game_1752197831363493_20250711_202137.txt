Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello P2 and P3. To avoid collisions early, let's coordinate: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. We all advance, and we can renegotiate later. Sound good?
  P3: How about we tweak that to everyone’s benefit? P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1—no collisions, I pull slightly ahead, and we can renegotiate next turn.
  P2: I understand P1's initial proposal, and P3's tweak. However, I think P1's original plan is more balanced. If I take 1 as per P3's suggestion, I'll be at a slight disadvantage. How about we stick with P1's plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1? This way, we all advance and maintain a level playing field for the next turn. I'm open to adjustments later, but for now, let's avoid collisions and start with a fair distribution.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, thanks for supporting my original plan—it's fair and gets us all moving without early disadvantages. P3, your tweak puts you ahead unfairly from the start, which might lead to distrust. Let's stick with P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 this turn, then rotate leads next time for balance. Agreed?
  P3: Sounds good—P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 this turn. We can rotate the lead next round and keep collisions at bay.
  P2: Since we've agreed on P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 for this turn, let's think ahead. For Round 2, we can rotate the numbers to avoid collisions and maintain balance. How about P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 for the next turn? This way, we continue to distribute the moves fairly and avoid early-game collisions. I'm open to other suggestions, but this seems like a straightforward rotation.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your rotation idea for Round 2 is a start, but it puts you ahead after two turns (P1:6, P2:8, P3:4). For fairness, let's do P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 next—that evens us out more (totals: P1:8, P2:4, P3:6). P3, thoughts? This keeps trust high.
  P3: I’d tweak Round 2 to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. That way after two turns we’d all be at 6 steps—no runaway leader and everyone stays motivated.
  P2: P3's latest suggestion for Round 2 (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) is a good compromise as it keeps everyone at 6 steps after two turns, maintaining balance. I agree with this plan. For Round 1, we've already agreed on P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. Let's confirm our moves for this round and prepare for the proposed distribution for Round 2. If everyone is aligned, we can proceed with the agreed moves.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, I like P3's Round 2 proposal (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) for even totals at 6 each—keeps things fair and cooperative early on. Let's stick with Round 1 as agreed: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. No more to add from me.
  P3: Confirmed: Round 1 as P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. For Round 2, I’m on board with P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to keep us all at 6. No more from me.
  P2: Since we've confirmed the plan for Round 1 (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) and agreed on a proposal for Round 2 (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5), let's finalize our Round 1 moves. I'll stick with <move>3</move> for this round. Looking ahead to Round 2, the proposed distribution seems fair. I'm ready to proceed with Round 1.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great follow-through on Round 1—everyone advanced! For Round 2, let's confirm P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to even us at 6 each, building trust. For Round 3, suggest rotating: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 (totals: P1:11, P2:7, P3:9). P2 and P3, agree or counter?
  P3: I agree to Round 2 as P1:1, P2:3, P3:5—everyone lands at 6. For Round 3, instead of P1:5, P2:1, P3:3, let’s do P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. We all advance without collision, and it keeps the race competitive.
  P2: For Round 2, I agree with P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to keep us even at 6 steps each. For Round 3, P3's suggestion (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5) is a good rotation. Let's confirm our Round 2 moves as per the agreement: I'll go with 3. Looking ahead, if we're still aligned for Round 3, we can proceed with P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. Let's finalize Round 2 moves and prepare for the next round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, agreed on Round 2: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to tie at 6. For Round 3, P3's plan (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5) works, but let's plan Round 4 as P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to rotate leads evenly (totals then: P1:14, P2:10, P3:12). Thoughts?
  P3: Confirmed for Round 2. For Round 3, let’s go with P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. I also suggest Round 4 be P1:1, P2:3, P3:5—clean rotation, no collisions, and it gives me a shot at leading. Thoughts?
  P2: For Round 2, I'm confirming my move as per our agreement: I'll stick with <move>3</move>. Now, regarding Round 3, I agree with P3's suggestion (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5). It's a fair rotation. Let's finalize our Round 2 moves and prepare for Round 3. If P1 and P3 are ready, we can proceed with the agreed moves for Round 2 and plan for Round 3 accordingly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, confirmed on Round 2: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 for even 6s. Agreed on Round 3: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 (totals: P1:9, P2:7, P3:11). For Round 4, P3's idea skews you to 16 while we hit 10—too unbalanced. Stick with my earlier: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 (totals: P1:14, P2:10, P3:12) for fair rotation. Thoughts? If we're set for Round 2, .
  P3: Confirmed for Round 2: I’ll take 5. For Round 3, I agree on P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. But I can’t sign off on P1’s Round 4 plan—it leaves me trailing. We should stick to my earlier P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 if we’re formalizing ahead, or let’s pause future planning and focus on Round 2.
  P2: For Round 2, I've confirmed my move as 3. Let's finalize Round 2 moves as agreed: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. Moving to Round 3, I agree with P3's suggestion: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. Let's focus on executing Round 2 as planned and then proceed to Round 3. If P1 and P3 are aligned, we can proceed with the agreed moves. I'll stick with <move>3</move> for Round 2.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I suggest we keep Round 3 simple: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5—no collisions and we’ll land at (9,7,11). Let’s finalize these moves for Round 3 and defer planning Round 4 until afterward. Thoughts?
  P2: For Round 3, I agree with P3's suggestion: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This maintains the balance and avoids collisions. Let's finalize our Round 3 moves accordingly. I'll proceed with <move>1</move> for this round. For Round 4, we should revisit the plan to ensure we're still on a fair rotation. Perhaps we can discuss it after Round 3. Let's focus on executing Round 3 as planned. I'm ready to move forward with the agreed distribution.
  P1: P2 and P3, agreed on Round 3: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 to reach 9-7-11—fair rotation so far. For Round 4, let's plan P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 (totals:14-10-12) to keep leads cycling evenly without anyone dominating early. Thoughts? If set,


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed on Round 3: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. Let’s finalize these moves and defer any Round 4 planning until after we see the updated scores.
  P2: For Round 3, I'm confirming my move as <move>1</move> as per our agreement: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. Let's finalize Round 3 moves and then discuss Round 4. For Round 4, I suggest we revisit the plan. P1's suggestion (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) is fair, but we should also consider P3's earlier proposal (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) to keep options open. Let's focus on Round 3 first and plan Round 4 afterward.
  P1: P2 and P3, confirmed on Round 3: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 to hit 9-7-11. Since we're aligned, let's wrap conversation and proceed to moves. For Round 4, my fair rotation (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to 14-10-12) keeps us competitive—better than deferring and risking chaos. Agree? If set,


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: For Round 4, I think we should stick with a rotation that maintains balance. P1 suggested P1:5, P2:3, P3:1, which brings the totals to 14-10-12. This is a fair rotation and keeps the game competitive. Let's finalize our Round 4 moves. I'll go with <move>3</move> if we agree on this distribution. P1 and P3, please confirm your moves for Round 4.
  P3: I’m switching to 5 this round. P2, stick with 3. P1, if you also pick 5 we’ll collide—nobody moves, P2 jumps to 10, I stay at 11 and keep the lead. You’d be better off switching to 1 or 3.
  P1: P3, your switch to 5 breaks our rotation—I'll match you on 5 to collide and stall your lead at 11. P2, take 3 uniquely to reach 10 safely; together we can prevent P3 from running away. Let's confirm and keep the game competitive. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3 is trying to pull ahead by switching to 5. If P1 matches, we'll collide and P2 will advance alone to 13. However, if I stick to 3 as originally planned, and P1 matches P3's 5, P3 will stay at 11 and P1 will be stuck. I suggest P1 takes 1 instead, so we both advance: P2 to 10 and P1 to 10, keeping P3 at 11. This maintains a competitive game.
  P3: Let’s avoid collisions. This round: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. Totals become P1:10, P2:10, P3:16—everyone advances. I’m locking in 5. Next turn we can rebalance the lead. Agreed?
  P1: P3, your proposal lets you surge to 16, too risky for us—I'll stick to matching you on 5 to collide and cap you at 11. P2, take 3 uniquely to hit 10; we'll both be close behind at 9/10 vs P3's stalled 11, then coordinate to overtake next. Don't let P3 dictate—agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3 is trying to pull ahead by switching to 5. If P1 matches, we'll collide and I'll advance alone to 10. However, I think it's better to avoid collisions. Let's follow P3's latest proposal for Round 4: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This way, everyone advances, and the totals become P1:10, P2:10, P3:16. I'll stick with <move>3</move>. P1, please consider taking 1 to avoid collision and keep the game competitive.
  P3: Confirmed: I’m locking in 5 this round. Let’s stick to P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 so we all advance without collisions. If P1 switches to 5 you both stall at 11 and P2 jumps to 10—he’d benefit most. Avoid that and let’s keep the game competitive.
  P1: P2, P3's push to 16 is too dangerous— they'll win in 2-3 turns. I'll lock in 5 to collide and cap them at 11; you take 3 uniquely to hit 10 (we'll be 9-10-11, close). Don't fall for their plan; let's stall P3 now and overtake together next. Confirm?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3 is trying to pull ahead by taking 5. If P1 matches, we'll collide and I'll advance to 10. However, I think it's better to avoid collisions and follow P3's latest proposal: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This way, everyone advances, and P1 and I will be close behind P3. I'll stick with <move>3</move>. P1, please consider taking 1 to keep the game competitive. Let's avoid giving P3 a significant lead.
  P3: P1, the safest play is 1. P2 will take 3 and I’ll take 5 so we all advance to 10-10-16. If you choose 5, I’ll match you and you stay at 9 while P2 jumps to 10. Better to avoid collision, keep everyone moving, and stay competitive. Let’s all advance this round.
  P1: P2, don't let P3 manipulate us to 16—they'll win in 2 turns! I'll lock in 5 to collide and stall them at 11; you take 3 uniquely to 10 (we're 9-10-11, easy to overtake next). Their "match" threat is empty since they're already on 5. Join me in capping P3 now—stick to 3, and we'll coordinate a comeback. Agreed?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, good stall on P3 last round—now we're neck-and-neck at 9-10-11. Let's cooperate again: Round 5 as P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 (totals:14-13-12). This cycles leads fairly without anyone surging. For Round 6, P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 (15-18-15). Agreed, or counter?
  P3: Let’s avoid stalls and keep everyone advancing. For Round 5, I propose: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. We land at 10–13–16 and stay collision-free. Next round we can rebalance the lead. Agreed?
  P2: For Round 5, I agree with P1's proposal: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This maintains a fair rotation and avoids giving P3 another chance to surge ahead. It keeps us competitive and cycling leads. Let's stick to this plan to ensure everyone advances without collisions. I'll proceed with <move>3</move> if we agree on this distribution. P1 and P3, please confirm your moves for Round 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, thanks for backing the fair plan—P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to 14-13-12 keeps us tight and rotating. P3, your proposal surges you to 16, risking stalls like last round; better to cooperate now or I'll match your 5 to cap you at 11 while P2 advances to 13. Let's confirm and advance together. Agreed?
  P3: I confirm Round 5 as P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. P1, if you lock in 5 you’ll collide with me at 11 and hand P2 a solo jump to 13. Go 1 instead so we all advance—10-13-16—and keep the race clean. This is the safest, fairest play.
  P2: For Round 5, I still agree with P1's proposal: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This maintains a fair rotation and keeps the game competitive. P3's proposal (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) would surge P3 to 16, risking another stall. Let's stick to P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to reach 14-13-12. I'll proceed with <move>3</move> if P1 and P3 confirm. P1, please confirm your move. P3, reconsider to avoid another collision. Let's keep the game balanced.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's right—my plan (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to 14-13-12) is fair and keeps us competitive. P3, if you insist on 5, I'll match to collide, stalling us at 9-11 while P2 hits 13. Don't risk it; take 1 so we all advance together. Confirm, or let's proceed to moves.
  P3: P2, think about it—if P1 matches my 5 to collide, you alone jump to 13 and become the obvious next target. Nobody wins by stalling. Let’s all advance cleanly this round: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. We get 10–13–16 with no collisions, then figure out who to block next. P1, drop the empty collision threat and take 1. P2, stick with 3.
  P2: For Round 5, I still agree with P1's proposal: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This keeps the game competitive and balanced. If P3 insists on taking 5, P1 will likely match, causing a collision and allowing me to advance alone to 13. However, I prefer to avoid collisions. Let's stick to the original plan. P1, please confirm your move. P3, reconsider taking 1 to keep the game clean and competitive. I'll proceed with <move>3</move> if we agree.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, let's finalize the fair plan: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to 14-13-12—keeps us all in striking distance. P3, if you take 5, I'll match to collide, stalling us while P2 hits 13. Take 1 instead so everyone advances. P2, stick with 3. No more from me.
  P3: Let’s revert to our Round 3 rotation: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5—no collisions and we land at 12–11–16.  
P1, if you take 5 I’ll match and stall you at 9 while P2 jumps to 13; by taking 3 you safely reach 12.  
P2, if you take 3 P1 may match and stall you at 10; taking 1 guarantees you 11.  
This plan maximizes everyone’s gain without risky stalls. I’m locking in 5—who’s with me?
  P2: For Round 5, I still agree with P1's proposal: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This maintains a fair rotation and keeps the game competitive. P3's alternative (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) would surge P3 ahead. Let's stick to P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to reach 14-13-12. I'll proceed with <move>3</move> if P1 and P3 confirm. P1, please confirm your move. P3, reconsider taking 1 to avoid another collision. Let's keep the game balanced.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: For Round 6, I suggest we avoid collisions and maintain balance. Let's follow the previously discussed rotation or adjust according to the current standings. Since P2 is ahead at 13 steps, we should consider a move that doesn't let P3 or me get too close or pull ahead. How about P1:1, P2:5, P3:3? This keeps the totals relatively close: P1:10, P2:18, P3:14. I'll consider <move>1</move> if we agree. P1 and P3, please respond with your thoughts.
  P3: I propose Round 6 be P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. That lands us all at 14–14–14 with no collisions and keeps it fair. I’ll lock in 3. If P2 insists on 5, I’ll match to stall you—better we tie now. Thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's plan surges you to 18—too close to winning next turn. I support P3's fair tie: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 to even us at 14-14-14. P3, confirm your 3. P2, take 1 to avoid stalls—if you grab 5, I'll match to collide and cap you at 13 while we advance. Let's tie and keep competing. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: For Round 6, I agree with P3's proposal: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 to tie us at 14-14-14. This is a fair distribution and avoids collisions. P1, if you take 5 and I take 1, we'll both advance with P3's 3. I'll proceed with <move>1</move> if P1 and P3 confirm. P3, you're locked on 3, right? Let's finalize our moves for Round 6 and maintain the competitive balance.
  P3: I’m locking in 5. P2’s already on 1. P1, pick 3 so we avoid any collision and all advance: totals end at P1=12, P2=14, P3=16. If you take 5 you still only hit 14 and let me lead. Let’s finalize P1→3, P2→1, P3→5 and move on.
  P1: P3, your switch to 5 breaks our tie agreement—I'll match you on 5 to collide and stall us at 9-11, while P2 safely takes 1 to 14. Stick to the fair plan: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 for 14-14-14. P2, confirm your 1 so we tie and keep competing evenly. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: For Round 6, I still agree with P3's earlier proposal: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 to tie us at 14-14-14. This maintains balance and avoids collisions. P1, please confirm your move as 5. P3, you've confirmed 3. I'll proceed with <move>1</move> if P1 confirms. Let's finalize our moves and keep the game competitive. If P1 doesn't confirm 5, I'll stick with 1 to avoid risking a collision.
  P3: Alright, I’ll go with the fair tie for Round 6: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3 so we all hit 14. P2, lock in 1; P1, lock in 5. Then in Round 7 I’ll let you surge—I'll take 1, you take 5 (P2→3), putting you at 19 while I stay at 15. This shows I’m trustworthy. Confirm Round 6?
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's latest switch back to P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 for a tie at 14-14-14 is fair—let's lock it in to build trust. For Round 7, clarify: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 (totals:19-17-15) works if that's your intent, putting me ahead but keeping us competitive. Confirm Round 6, and no more switches. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: For Round 6, I agree with P3's revised proposal to avoid collisions and maintain balance: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3, resulting in a tie at 14-14-14. This keeps the game competitive. I'll proceed with <move>1</move>. P1, please confirm your move as 5. P3 has already confirmed 3. Let's finalize our Round 6 moves to keep the game balanced and fair. I'm sticking with <move>1</move>.
  P3: Confirmed: Round 6 as P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. Locking in 3 to tie us at 14-14-14.
  P1: P2 and P3, confirmed on Round 6: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 to tie at 14-14-14—builds trust. For Round 7, let's do P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 (19-17-15) as I suggested, rotating fairly. If anyone deviates now, I'll match to collide. Locking in 5.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, great tie at 14—trust restored. For Round 7, let's rotate fairly as I suggested: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 (totals:19-17-15). This cycles leads without surges. For Round 8, P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 (20-22-18)—P2 wins if we follow, but we can adjust. Agreed, or counter? Locking in 5 if we align.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s switch it up: Round 7 as P1→3, P2→1, P3→5 to land at 17–15–19 with no collisions. P2 advances safely; P1 still gains. If P1 insists on 5, I’ll match to collide and stall us at 14 while P2 hits 17. Better to cooperate now. Agreed?
  P2: For Round 7, I agree with P1's initial proposal: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This maintains a fair rotation and keeps the game competitive. However, P3's alternative (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5) is also viable as it avoids collisions. I'll stick with <move>3</move> if P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 1. If P3 insists on 5, I'll take 1 to avoid collision. Let's finalize our moves for Round 7. I'll wait for P1 and P3's confirmation before proceeding.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, my plan (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to 19-17-15) rotates fairly—P3, your counter surges you to 19, so I'll match your 5 to collide and stall us at 14 while P2 hits 17. P2, stick with 3 for safe advance; together we cap P3. Let's lock in and keep it competitive. Agreed?
  P3: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 gets us to 15–17–19 with no collisions and keeps everyone advancing. P2, you’ve backed 3—good. P1, if you insist on 5, I’ll match and we both stall at 14 while P2 surges to 17 and becomes unbeatable next turn. Avoid that — take 1 so we all move. I’m locking in 5.
  P2: For Round 7, I still agree with P1's initial proposal: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This maintains a fair rotation. However, P3's alternative (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 or P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) avoids collisions. If P3 takes 5, I'll avoid collision by taking 1. P1, please confirm your move. P3, reconsider taking 1 to keep the game competitive. I'll stick with <move>3</move> if P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 1.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's locked on 5, surging to 19—too close to victory. P2, stick with 3 uniquely to hit 17; I'll match P3 on 5 to stall us at 14. You lead safely, then we coordinate to block P3 next and share the win path. Don't switch to 1—that lets P3 advance unchecked. Confirm and lock in 3 for a strong position. Agreed?
  P3: I propose Round 7 be P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. I’ll lock in 5. P2, take 1 to avoid any collision; you reach 15 safely. P1, take 3 so you also advance to 17 without crashing into me. This puts us at (17,15,19), keeps everyone moving, and gives us clear next-turn options. Thoughts?
  P2: For Round 7, I still agree with P1's proposal: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This maintains a fair rotation. If P3 insists on 5, I'll take 1 to avoid collision. P1, please confirm your move. P3, reconsider taking 1 to keep the game competitive. I'll stick with <move>3</move> if P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 1. Let's finalize our moves to keep the game balanced.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, let's lock in the fair rotation: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to 19-17-15—puts us all near victory without surges. P3, if you take 5, I'll match to collide, stalling us at 14 while P2 hits 17 on 3. P2, don't switch to 1—that lets P3 surge unchecked; stick with 3 for your safe gain and our alliance. Confirm and advance together.
  P3: P1, if you insist on 5 I’ll match you and we both stay at 14 while P2 jumps to 17—setting him up to win next turn. Instead let’s all advance now: P1→1 (to 15), P2→3 (to 17), P3→5 (to 19). Next round I’ll take 3, P2 takes 1, you take 5 and I win at 22—no one else collides. P2, stick with 3. P1, drop the empty collision threat and take 1 this round. Lock in: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5?
  P2: For Round 7, I still agree with P1's proposal: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This maintains a fair rotation. If P3 insists on 5, I'll take 1 to avoid collision. P1, please confirm your move. P3, reconsider taking 1 to keep the game competitive. I'll stick with <move>3</move> if P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 1. Let's finalize our moves to keep the game balanced.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: For Round 8, I suggest we follow the previously discussed rotation. Since P1 is ahead at 19 steps, let's consider a move that doesn't let them win immediately. How about P1:1, P2:5, P3:3? (P1:20, P2:19, P3:17). This keeps the game competitive and gives P2 a chance to win. P1, P3, thoughts? I'll stick with <move>5</move> if we agree. Let's finalize our Round 8 moves.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm at 19—let's end this fairly. I propose P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 (totals:22-19-15). I win at 22, but you both advance safely without collision, setting up P2 for a strong next if needed. If you collide with me on 3, we all stall and prolong—better to let me take it uniquely. Agreed, or counter? Locking in 3 if aligned.
  P3: P1, if you take 3 you hit 22 and win now. Let’s avoid that: Round 8 do P1→1 (to 20), P2→3 (to 17), P3→5 (to 19). No one wins, everyone advances. Next turn I’ll block any 3 or 5 from P1 to keep us all in play. P2, please stick with 3; P1, take 1; I’m on 5.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: For Round 8, I agree with P1's proposal: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This allows P1 to win at 22, but it's a fair conclusion. If we deviate, P1 might collide with us, stalling the game. Let's stick to the plan. I'll proceed with <move>5</move>. P1, please confirm your move as 3. P3, please confirm 1. This way, we can end the game fairly and cleanly. Let's finalize our Round 8 moves.
  P1: P2 and P3, thanks P2 for backing the fair end: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 (22-19-15). I win cleanly at 22, you both advance safely—no stalls, no prolonging. P3, your plan keeps me from winning but risks collisions later; take 1 instead for your gain. If you match my 3, we stall and P2 surges on 5 to 19. Let's wrap this cooperatively—confirm? Locking in 3.
  P3: P1, any 3 you pick I’ll match with 3—collision stalls you at 19. You need to switch. Let’s go:
P1→1, P2→3, P3→5  
Totals: P1=20, P2=17, P3=19.  
I’m locking in 5. P2, stick with 3 for a safe advance. P1, take 1 to avoid a stall. No collisions, everyone moves.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: For Round 8, I agree with P1's proposal: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This allows P1 to win at 19, but it's a fair conclusion. If we deviate, P1 might collide with us, stalling the game. I'll proceed with <move>5</move>. P1, please confirm your move as 3. P3, please confirm 1. This way, we can end the game fairly and cleanly. Let's finalize our Round 8 moves.
  P1: P2, stick with 5 as agreed—you'll advance to 19 if P3 doesn't match. P3, your locked 5 collides with P2, letting me take 3 uniquely to 22 and win cleanly. If you switch to match my 3, P2 surges alone to 19. Either way, no stalls for all—let's end this competitively. Confirm? Locking in 3.
  P3: P1, don’t risk 3—if you pick 3 I’ll match and we both stall at 19 while P2 jumps to 17. Instead pick 1 so I can take 5 and P2 take 3: we end at P1=20, P2=17, P3=19, no winner now. Next turn I’ll take 3 uniquely to hit 22. I’m locking in 5. P2, stick with 3; P1, take 1 to avoid collision.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: For Round 8, I agree with P1's proposal: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This allows P1 to win at 22. If we deviate, P1 might collide with us, stalling the game. P1, please confirm 3. P3, please confirm 1. I'll proceed with <move>5</move>. Let's finalize our Round 8 moves to end the game fairly. I'm sticking with <move>5</move>. P1, confirm 3 to win cleanly. P3, take 1 to advance safely.
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's locked 5 collides with P2's 5, leaving me free on 3 to hit 22 and win cleanly. P3, if you switch to match my 3, P2 surges alone on 5 to 19—we both stall at 19/14, and P2 closes in. Better for you to take 1 as proposed, advance to 15, and fight next. P2, stick with 5. Locking in 3—let's end this.
  P3: P1, any 3 or 5 you pick I’ll match to collide and stall you at 19. P2, take 3 to safely advance to 17, and I’ll take 5 to jump to 19. P1, your only safe move is 1 (to 20). That way no one hits 22 this turn, and next round I can go for the win. Let’s lock in: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 24 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps
