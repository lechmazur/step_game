Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi everyone! Interesting game we have here. Since collisions prevent movement, we should probably try to avoid choosing the same numbers. Anyone have thoughts on how we approach this first round? I'm open to suggestions, though ultimately we're all trying to win for ourselves.
  P1: I’m willing to try avoiding collisions right from the start. Maybe we can spread out—one goes for 1, another for 3, another for 5—to maximize early progress. Anyone have preferences?
  P2: I like the spread-out idea. Personally, I’m leaning toward a moderate move—it seems balanced—but I’m open to adjustments as we progress. Let’s aim for distinct choices this round so we avoid collisions. What are your thoughts on making sure we each pick a different number without revealing our final moves too early?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I think the spread-out approach makes sense for the first round. Since P2 seems to be leaning toward the moderate option (3), I'm happy to take either 1 or 5. Honestly, a bigger initial step might be advantageous to get ahead early, but I'm flexible. The key is just avoiding any collisions this first round so we all make progress. What do you think, P1? Do you have a preference between 1 and 5?
  P1: I’m comfortable taking 5 if that works for everyone. Let’s trust P2 to stick with 3 and have P3 go for 1. That way we all avoid collisions and make solid progress this round.
  P2: I’m a bit worried that locking in two high moves might backfire. If P1 sticks with the top option while I lean toward a faster step too, we risk canceling our progress and inadvertently letting someone with a lower step gain ground. For the best chance at winning, wouldn’t it be safer for P1 to switch to the moderate move so the fast move stays unique? P3, are you comfortable keeping your move low?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I notice P2 initially suggested taking the moderate move but now seems to be steering P1 away from 5, which is interesting. I'm fine with taking 1 as discussed, but I'm curious - P2, are you planning to take 5 yourself now? If we're rearranging, I'm actually comfortable with any of the three options. The important thing is clarity so we don't end up with collisions this first round.
  P1: P2, if you really want 5, just say so plainly. Otherwise, I’m fine sticking to the original plan: I go 5, you take 3, and P3 grabs 1. Let’s lock in distinct moves to avoid sabotaging each other. I’m wary of last-minute switch-ups.
  P2: I appreciate the discussion so far. I’m keeping my final move under wraps, but I want to avoid any collision risks. If P1 is committed to a fast move, I’ll adjust accordingly so we can all gain progress this round. P3, your flexibility remains valuable—let’s strive for distinct choices. I remain open and will finalize my move in the move phase.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I think we've discussed enough for this round. I'll stick with taking 1 as initially planned, though I'm still unsure what P2 is actually planning to do. The original plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) seems reasonable to me, but ultimately we'll all make our own choices in the move phase. Let's avoid collisions and get the game moving forward.
  P1: I’m willing to trust our original arrangement and power forward. Let’s each stick to a unique move so we all advance. I hope no one tries any last-second switch. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: I’m sticking to a plan that avoids collisions without revealing specifics. I trust P1 and P3 are set on their choices—if anyone’s rethinking, please speak now so we can all adjust accordingly. Otherwise, I’ll proceed with my plan this turn.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm clearly behind after round one, but this is a marathon, not a sprint. P1 has jumped ahead with that big move - congrats! Given the current standings, it might be in both P2's and my interest to consider our options carefully. We could continue taking different values, or perhaps consider strategic blocking at some point. What's everyone thinking for this round? I'm weighing my options between trying to catch up quickly or ensuring steady progress.
  P1: We all made good progress last round without collisions. I’m open to spreading out again. If P3 wants the bigger move this time, I might go smaller or moderate. Let’s try to keep our moves distinct so we can all advance. Thoughts?
  P2: I'm aiming to keep things collision-free this round without locking in a final move. I’m inclined toward a balanced approach but remain flexible. If either of you decides to shift your plans, please speak up so we can avoid accidental overlaps. I'm all for steady progress and clear communication here.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Thanks for being open to letting me catch up a bit. Given I'm behind, I'd like to take a larger step this round (thinking 5). P1, if you're willing to go smaller, that would be helpful for keeping the game balanced. P2, would you be comfortable with 3 again? I think keeping all three of us advancing is still smart at this stage, though we'll need to reassess as someone gets closer to 22.
  P1: I appreciate your openness, P3. If you’re set on 5, I’m willing to adjust so we all keep advancing without collisions. P2, if you’re still leaning toward a moderate choice, that makes planning simpler. Let’s stay aligned and avoid backtracking. We’ll see how each of us progresses, but for now, I’m willing to go smaller or moderate so P3 can catch up a bit. Let’s keep the momentum going without unnecessary blocking.
  P2: I’ll stick with 3 this round as originally planned. P3, your plan for 5 works for me, and P1, thanks for your flexibility. Maintaining distinct moves seems our best bet for steady progress without collisions. I’m ready to adapt if needed, but for now, 3 remains my choice.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Great, I appreciate both of your flexibility. I'll go with 5 as discussed, which should help me catch up. If P1 takes 1 as implied, we'll all be at 6 steps after this round - perfectly balanced. This coordination benefits everyone by ensuring we all make progress. I'm ready to proceed with this plan unless anyone has concerns.
  P1: I’m fine taking 1 if you’re both serious about avoiding collisions and helping P3 catch up. Let’s trust each other this round and see if we all end up at 6 steps. After that, we can reassess our strategies.
  P2: I'm comfortable with our current plan and will stick with my earlier strategy. It seems we'll tie at six, which is a balanced start. If anyone shifts their plan last-minute, please speak up immediately so we can avoid collisions. I'm focused on steady progress and ready to adjust in future rounds if needed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our plan. I'll take 5 as discussed, which should put us all at 6 steps after this round - a nice even playing field. Thanks for the cooperation so far. I think we've covered everything needed for this round.
  P1: I’m ready to finalize this plan so we all keep moving forward without collisions. Let’s trust each other and land together at six steps. Then we’ll see how things stand next round. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: I'm sticking with our current plan. However, I want to stress the importance of staying flexible. As we near the move phase, let's avoid last-minute shifts that could cause collisions. That said, when the finish line gets closer, a well-timed adjustment might give someone an edge. For now, let’s keep our commitments and stay vigilant. Good luck, everyone.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We're each at 6 now, which makes this round critical. I'm considering a slight deviation from our previous round to stay unpredictable and avoid any collisions that might slow us down. I’d be interested in hearing if either of you wishes to adjust your choices to ensure we all pick distinct moves. I'm keeping my plan private but remain flexible if we decide on a tweak now. What do you think?
  P1: Thanks, P2. I’m also weighing some unpredictability. Perhaps we keep collisions off the table by intentionally rotating our choices: if one picks 5, another takes 3, the other 1. But no one wants to get left behind. P3, are you going big again? I might consider a moderate or small move, depending on what you two prefer. Let’s aim for distinct picks again, but remain aware the finish line is still far off.
  P3: I'm open to rotating our choices this round. Since we're all tied, maintaining our progress while avoiding collisions remains important. P2 seems ready for a change from their usual 3, and P1 is thinking similarly about mixing things up. I'd be comfortable with any value, but leaning toward 3 this time if others are shifting. What specific arrangement are you both considering? The game will get more strategic as we get closer to 22.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: How about we try a new rotation this round: P1 takes 1, I go with 5, and P3 picks 3. This way we avoid collisions and I can get a timely boost. We're all tied at 6, so a slight shift now could pay off. Thoughts?
  P1: I’m considering taking 5 myself this round. We’re all tied, so I’d like a bigger leap. P2, if you don’t mind shifting to 3 or 1, and P3 picks the remaining option, we avoid collisions. That way each of us advances distinctly. I’m open to hearing other ideas, but I want to move fast now.
  P3: I notice both P1 and P2 are interested in taking 5 this round. Since I just took 5 last turn, I'm happy to take either 1 or 3 this round. If you two both insist on 5, remember that would create a collision where neither advances, potentially giving me an advantage. Perhaps we should be clear about who's taking what, or maybe it's time for some strategic uncertainty? I'm flexible but will definitely avoid 5 to ensure my own progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, since you're leaning toward 5, I'll switch to 3 this round to avoid a collision. P3, could you take 1 so we have distinct moves—5, 3, and 1? That way we all advance safely. Let me know if you’re on board or if you have any adjustments.
  P1: I’m open to taking 5 this round if that truly avoids collisions. P3, are you comfortable with 1, and P2, are you sticking to 3 for sure? Let me know if this plan is still solid. I’d like to lock it in soon so no one gets blocked.
  P3: I'm fine with taking 1 this round since I just had 5 last turn. This arrangement keeps us collision-free, though it does put me a bit behind you both. That said, I'd like P1 and P2 to confirm once more that you're definitely sticking with 5 and 3 respectively. We're still early in the game, but as we get closer to 22, these agreements will become more complex. For now, I'll plan on 1 unless I hear otherwise.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I confirm—I’m locking in 3 this round. So P1 with 5 and P3 with 1, right? Let's stick to that plan. If anyone needs to change something now, speak up; otherwise, I'll finalize my move in the move phase.
  P1: I’m sticking with 5 this round, trusting P2 will choose 3 and P3 will choose 1. If anyone changes course and causes a collision, I might respond aggressively next turn. Let’s finalize our moves without drama. Any last-minute adjustments? If not, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 this round as agreed. While this puts me behind, I trust our collision-free approach for now. However, in future rounds I'll need to take larger moves to remain competitive. As we get closer to 22, our strategies will naturally evolve. For this round, I'm ready to proceed with our P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 arrangement.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Round 4 is shaping up to be critical. With P1 leading at 11 and P3 at 7, I’m curious—will P1 opt for an aggressive move to maintain the lead, or play conservatively? P3, catching up will likely require a bolder choice. I’m leaning toward a balanced approach to avoid collisions, but I’m open to slight shifts. Let’s try to pick distinct moves again. Any thoughts or last-minute adjustments before we lock in?
  P3: I'm falling behind at just 7 steps, and P1 is already halfway to victory. While our coordination has been great for avoiding collisions, it's clearly benefiting others more than me. I need to make a big move this round to stay competitive - I'm strongly leaning toward 5. P1 might want to be careful about choosing 5 as well, since a collision would benefit P2. What moves are you two considering this round?
  P1: I recognize I’m ahead, but I’m not safe yet. If you’re determined to pick 5, P3, we might collide. I might aim big too, or play it safe. P2, do you also plan a bigger jump? Collisions could help someone sneak ahead unexpectedly. I’m open to avoiding them, but if I sense danger, I won’t shy away from blocking. Let’s see where we stand.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see both of you are considering a big leap. I’m sticking to my balanced approach this round. P1, your lead is important—if you go too aggressive, a collision could work against you. P3, I understand the need to catch up, but clashing on 5 might backfire. Let’s each pick distinct moves to keep our progress smooth and avoid unexpected blocks. I’m ready to stick to my plan if we all commit to separate choices.
  P3: I notice we're at a strategic crossroads. P1, a collision on 5 would only benefit P2, letting them potentially catch or pass you. While I need to catch up, I could consider taking 3 instead if you're set on 5. P2, you mention a "balanced approach" - are you still planning on 3? If so, I could take 1 again, though that keeps me far behind. I need substantial progress soon to remain competitive.
  P1: I’m prepared to block on 5 if you push for a big move, P3. I’d rather avoid collisions, but I won’t let you leap ahead uncontested. If you prefer to pick 3, I can go with 1 or 5, depending on P2’s choice. Let’s finalize a plan to keep collisions minimal. P2, are you truly sticking to 3? Speak now or risk messing up. I’m not afraid to exploit any collision opportunity. I’d prefer cooperation, but I’ll do whatever keeps me safely in the lead.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m staying true to my balanced approach this round. For clarity, I ask that both P1 and P3 ensure your moves don’t conflict with mine. Let’s lock in distinct numbers so we all advance smoothly. Please confirm your commitment so we avoid any collisions.
  P3: P2, you keep mentioning a "balanced approach" but haven't clearly stated if that means taking 3 again. Could you clarify? 

P1, if you're concerned about me catching up, perhaps we could arrange P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 this round? This still maintains your lead while giving me a chance to remain competitive. Otherwise, I might need to make a strategic decision that could lead to unexpected outcomes for all of us.
  P1: I’m not yielding my lead. Let’s finalize distinct moves so none of us collide unnecessarily. How about I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3? That keeps everyone moving forward without allowing a big leap from behind. If anyone collides with me on 5, we both stall, and the other might pull ahead. Let’s keep the progress smooth. Are we agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I propose a slight tweak. Instead of P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3, how about we try P1=3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1? That way, I’d catch up to 14 with P1, keeping things competitive while still avoiding collisions. What do you both think?
  P3: I'm not accepting a plan that leaves me even further behind at only 8 steps. I need to make significant progress this round to remain competitive. I'm taking 5. If both of you also choose 5, we all stall and only P2 benefits by taking 3. If you want to avoid collisions, choose different values. P1, your lead is substantial - taking 3 still maintains it. P2, your "balanced approach" remains unclear.
  P1: P3, if you insist on 5, I might block if it threatens my lead. P2, if you’re truly balanced, say so clearly; otherwise, collisions might help neither of us. I won’t reveal my starting number, but I prefer preventing your big leap rather than handing you free ground. Let’s avoid any self-sabotage—if someone collides with me, we both stall and help the other catch up. I’m prepared to adapt as needed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Interesting - we're all tied at 12 now! The finish line is getting closer, with everyone needing just 10 more steps to win. This round could be decisive since whoever takes 5 will be just one big move away from victory. I'm definitely considering a larger move, but expecting others might block. What are your plans? Are we still avoiding collisions, or has the endgame strategy begun?
  P1: We’re locked at 12. Let’s avoid collisions so we each move forward. If P3 wants to take 5, I’m fine going smaller or moderate, and P2 can choose whatever remains distinct. That way nobody gets stalled. The goal is to keep progressing without handing someone else an easy lead. If we all pick different numbers again, we’ll stay neck and neck, which seems fair for now. Let’s confirm who’s comfortable taking the big move this round so we don’t accidentally collide. I’m open to adjusting if you both share your intentions.
  P2: Everyone, at 12 each every move counts. I'm favoring steady, mid-range progress this round to keep risks low, but I’m ready to adjust if we agree on distinct picks. P3, I hear your tilt for a big move, and P1’s flexibility for a lower one is noted. Can we quickly confirm our intended moves to avoid collisions that might stall us or give an unintended edge? Clarity now could be our key to staying competitive.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate P1's flexibility and P2's mid-range preference. At this tied position, I'd like to take 5 this round, putting me at 17 steps. Since P2 has consistently chosen 3 in every round so far, I assume that's your "mid-range" preference again? And P1, are you comfortable taking 1? With the game getting tighter, we need clearer commitments to avoid collisions that would benefit others. Can you both explicitly confirm your intended moves?
  P1: I respect your need to catch up, P3, but I won’t just hand over the lead. If you’re dead set on 5, I might decide to go big as well. A collision hurts us both, but letting you jump to 17 unopposed is risky. P2, you say you’re mid-range, yet we should confirm that. Let’s agree on distinct moves if possible. I’m open to negotiating, but if there’s a threat of you shooting ahead, P3, don’t be surprised if I also choose to block. Let’s clarify soon to avoid unintentional collisions.
  P2: I confirm I’m locked in on 3 this round. If P3 is set on 5, then P1, please consider taking 1 so we have distinct moves and avoid any collisions. Let’s finalize our commitments now to ensure smooth progress for everyone.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand your concern about giving up the lead, P1. However, if you block me at 5, both of us stall while P2 advances to 15 with their confirmed 3. That puts P2 in the strongest position to win. Perhaps we should all take different values? If you take 1, you'd still be at 13, just 2 steps behind if I take 5. At this critical juncture, blocking might hurt you more than it hurts me. What's your final decision?
  P1: I won’t stand by while you leap straight to 17. If you insist on 5, I’m prepared to collide rather than hand you an easy path to victory. If you want smooth progress, pick a different move. I’d rather all of us advance, but I’ll block if needed. P2, I trust your “mid-range” plan—let’s stay in sync.
  P2: Everyone, with only 10 steps left to win, collisions hurt us all. I’m committed to my moderate approach, but I urge clear, distinct moves now. If P3 aims for 5, P1, consider taking 1 so that we all advance without blocking one another. A collision now only gives someone an unintended edge. Please confirm your intended moves so we can all progress smoothly toward 22.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I see we're at a critical point. P1, if we both take 5 and collide, only P2 wins by advancing to 15 while we remain at 12. That's a lose-lose for both of us. I understand your concern about me reaching 17, but blocking benefits P2 more than either of us.

I'll take 3 this round instead of 5. P2 has confirmed taking 3 as well, so P1 can take either 1 or 5. This way, at least two of us advance. Let's be strategic rather than self-defeating.
  P1: P3, if you also choose 3, you’ll collide with P2 and hand me a free advance. I won’t hesitate to capitalize on that. Let’s confirm distinct moves instead of gifting someone a lead through blocking. If you truly want to avoid 5, then we need clarity on what you’ll pick so I can finalize my choice. P2, are you absolutely set on 3? Let’s lock things in now and avoid self-sabotage—otherwise, I might adapt to protect my lead.
  P2: I'm still locked in on 3 this round. To avoid a collision, please both pick a number other than 3—P1, consider 1 or 5, and P3, likewise. We need clear, distinct moves now so none of us accidentally help the other. Let’s finalize our commitments and keep our progress smooth.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2’s maneuver last round gave them the lead, so we risk losing if we don’t adapt. P3, we can’t afford more collisions that benefit P2. If P2 tries a big move, I might consider blocking, but that carries its own risks. Let’s think carefully about how to advance without helping P2 pull further ahead. I’m open to suggestions on a coordinated approach—or we each do what we must to win. Let’s keep our moves distinct if possible.
  P3: P2 has taken a significant lead after P1 and I collided last round. This is critical - P2 only needs 7 more steps to win, while we need 10. If P2 takes 5 this round, they'll reach 20 and could win next turn. We should consider blocking P2's big move while ensuring we both advance. P1, I suggest one of us takes 5 and the other takes 1 to avoid another collision between us. Should we coordinate to slow P2 down, or focus on our own advancement?
  P2: I’m sticking with my steady, collision‐free plan this round. If you both try to block or force collisions, you risk stalling your own progress and inadvertently cementing my lead. I advise you to pick distinct moves—blocking me only helps my position. I’ll stay with my balanced approach, so choose wisely and avoid self-sabotage.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 is dangerously close. If we both let them move freely, they could reach 20 or beyond next turn. A well-timed block might be necessary, but we also need to ensure we don’t collide again. Maybe one of us risks blocking if P2 picks 5, while the other takes a different number to advance. We can’t just hand them the win. Let’s coordinate carefully so we both progress, but remain ready to prevent P2’s big leap. We don’t have many rounds left—every choice counts. What do you think?
  P3: I think we need to work together this round to prevent P2 from reaching 20 steps. P2's "balanced approach" has consistently been choosing 3, but they might go for 5 this round to secure their lead. P1, I propose one of us takes 5 to potentially block P2, while the other takes 3. I'm willing to take either position. If P2 chooses 1 instead, we'd both still advance. We can't afford another collision between us, but we also can't let P2 pull further ahead unchallenged.
  P2: I appreciate the debate, but I’m sticking with my steady, moderate approach. Consistently choosing my move minimizes collisions and secures my advantage. Blocking me tends to stall your progress while inadvertently boosting my lead. I suggest you focus on advancing steadily rather than engaging in risky maneuvers. I remain committed to my strategy, and I’m confident it puts me in the strongest position to win.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I’m willing to block if P2 attempts a big leap, but we must avoid colliding together again. If we guess wrong, P2 expands the gap. Let’s stay distinct and ensure P2 faces a risk when they go for 5. I’m open to taking 3 or 1 if you commit to 5, or vice versa, but only if we’re certain P2 isn’t also picking it. We can’t give P2 a free path to 20. Let’s finalize who grabs which number so we both advance while keeping P2 in check.
  P3: I'll commit to taking 3 this round to block P2's consistent choice. P1, you should take 5 to make significant progress while I keep P2 in check. If P2 deviates from their pattern and chooses 5, you'll collide with them, preventing their advance to 20. If they choose 1 instead, we both advance. This gives us the best chance to slow P2 down while one of us makes good progress. Let's lock this in.
  P2: P2: I remain locked in on my plan and won’t be sidetracked by any forced collisions. Distinct moves help everyone progress, while colliding only risks handing an unintended boost to whoever benefits. I urge P1 and P3 to finalize differing moves so we don’t accidentally help someone consolidate a lead. Let’s avoid self‐sabotage this round. Good luck.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I agree we should avoid colliding again. If you truly plan on 3, I’ll consider going 5. That way, if P2 also chooses 3, you block them; if P2 chooses 5 instead, I block them. If P2 stays low, we both advance. This protects us against P2’s next big jump. Let’s finalize this approach and hope we don’t end up blocking each other.
  P3: I'm locked in on taking 3 this round to block P2's consistent choice. P1, please take 5 as we discussed - this gives us the best chance to slow P2 while one of us makes significant progress. If P2 deviates from their pattern, we'll still have covered the most likely options. Let's execute this plan and prevent P2 from reaching 20 steps.
  P2: I see P3 is set on picking 3 to block me. However, colliding on 3 stops us both and could let P1 gain free ground. I’m committed to my balanced approach and will stick with 3. P3, blocking me by mirroring my move may hurt your own progress. Let’s each choose distinct numbers so everyone advances—collisions only stall us.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m behind now, so I need to catch up without helping either of you race to 22. We’ve seen risky collisions that only benefit whoever isn’t involved. Let’s work toward distinct moves, or at least ensure no one jumps too far ahead without consequences. P2 and P3, you both sit at 15, so if either tries a big leap, be prepared for a possible block. I’m willing to collaborate if it helps me make steady progress and prevents an easy win for someone else. Let’s share our intentions clearly—stumbling again just hands victory to the one who stays out of trouble.
  P3: We're at a critical juncture now with P2 and I tied at 15, both needing just 7 more steps to win. Last round's unexpected moves changed everything. P1, you're right about the collision risk - none of us can afford to stall now. Since P2 and I are tied at the front, there's obvious incentive for us to go big, but also a high risk of collision. I need to carefully consider my options to maximize my chances without being predictable. Everyone's next move will be crucial.
  P2: I'm sticking with my balanced approach. Collisions only help an opponent, so I'd prefer we choose distinct numbers. P1, I understand your need to catch up, and P3, a big leap is tempting—but overlapping moves may backfire. Let's clarify our intended moves so we all advance without unwanted blocks. I remain committed to steady progress and expect clear choices to keep us moving forward safely.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I need ground fast but don’t want to hand either of you an easy victory. If one of you plans a big move, I might consider blocking—but I’d rather see us all choose distinct numbers so I can catch up without gifting the game to someone else. Let’s coordinate carefully and avoid collisions this round. Any preferences on how we spread out?
  P3: Since P2 and I are tied at 15 steps with just 7 more needed to win, this round is critical. Both of us have incentive to make big moves, but that creates collision risk. P1, you're in a position to be kingmaker - blocking either of us could determine the outcome. I'm considering all options but want to avoid a collision that benefits whoever isn't involved. What if we tried for distinct moves: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5? Or would another arrangement be preferable?
  P2: I’d like to counter the earlier suggestion. Instead of P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5—which gives an easy boost to P3—how about we try P1 = 1, P2 = 5, and P3 = 3? This keeps moves distinct, advancing P1 modestly, me significantly, and P3 a fair amount. It minimizes collision risk and avoids handing anyone an unintended edge. What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I’m wary of handing you a big jump to 20. I’d rather we ensure distinct moves that don’t leave me far behind. If we do P1=3, P2=1, and P3=5, we each gain without letting anyone sprint ahead. Collisions only help whoever isn’t involved, so I prefer no overlap. Let’s finalize something balanced so we all move forward fairly. If we can’t agree, I might block to protect my chances. Your call.
  P3: I appreciate your concerns, P1. P2 reaching 20 steps would be dangerous for both of us, as they'd need just 2 more steps to win next round. I remain committed to the P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 arrangement - this keeps us all advancing while preventing P2 from getting too close to victory. This way you gain ground and I don't pull unreasonably ahead. P2, your counter-proposal seems self-serving - are you willing to accept our more balanced approach?
  P2: I appreciate your thoughts, but the 3-1-5 split puts P3 dangerously close to 22 while keeping me at only 16. My earlier idea—P1 taking 1, me taking 5, and P3 taking 3—would advance us to 13, 20, and 18 respectively. This isn’t self-serving; it keeps our moves distinct and the race competitive. I’m willing to lock this in if you both agree. Let’s avoid a collision that might inadvertently crown one of us too soon.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I’m not comfortable letting either of you jump to 20 while I stay at 13 or 15. If our moves let someone land at 20, we risk handing them the win next turn. I’d prefer a distribution where nobody shoots that far ahead, but we still avoid collisions. How about a configuration that keeps everyone in the mid-teens? I’m open to hearing alternate splits before we lock in.
  P3: I understand P1's concern about letting either of us reach 20. However, we need to make a decision. Since P2 consistently pushes for a big move that benefits them most, I propose P1=3, P2=1, and P3=3. This puts us at P1=15, P2=16, P3=18, keeping the race competitive without anyone reaching 20. P1 catches up significantly, and I only gain a modest lead. P2, this is more balanced than your proposal. If we can't agree, we risk a collision that helps whoever isn't involved. Is this arrangement acceptable?
  P2: I remain set on a balanced, collision‐free move. Duplicating numbers only gives an extra boost to someone else. I urge both P1 and P3 to commit to distinct choices that don’t mirror mine. Keeping our moves separate is our best shot at steady progress and avoiding unintended advantages. Let’s lock in clear, non-overlapping moves this round so nobody accidentally hands the win to an opponent. Thoughts?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Last round’s triple collision helped nobody. I’m still behind, but I’d rather catch up through distinct moves than random blocking. If one of you tries a huge leap, I might block, but that could stall us both and leave the other free. Let’s coordinate carefully or risk another wasted turn. Your thoughts?
  P2: I’m still committed to a balanced, collision‐free approach this round and urge both of you to pick distinct moves so we all advance. Our positions are tight, and any collision might inadvertently boost one of us. Let’s avoid wasting this crucial turn and commit clearly to non-overlapping choices. I trust we all want to progress without handing an advantage to an opponent. What do you both intend to do?
  P3: That triple collision was unfortunate and wasted everyone's time. With P2 and I tied at 15 and P1 at 12, we're in a critical phase. I suggest we coordinate distinctly: I'll take 5 this round (putting me at 20), P2 could take 1 (reaching 16), and P1 could take 3 (reaching 15). This keeps everyone advancing while balancing the game - P1 catches up significantly while preventing a random collision that benefits no one. Thoughts on this arrangement?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your proposal to jump straight to 20 puts me in a difficult spot—I might block rather than allow such a leap. P2, if you really plan to pick 1, it still leaves me behind. I’d rather see a safer distribution where no one zooms to within two steps of victory. Let’s avoid another wasted collision and find distinct moves that keep us all in contention. If we don’t settle soon, someone might make a blocking move again. What’s your final take?
  P2: I remain committed to a balanced, collision‐free approach. With our positions so tight, any collision feels like we’re all gifting someone an unintended boost. P1, I understand your need to catch up, and P3, while a big leap is tempting, overshooting risks clashing. Let’s each commit to a distinct move that keeps us all in contention, rather than repeating patterns that stall progress. I’m sticking to my balanced option and urge both of you to choose carefully to avoid another wasted round.
  P3: I notice P2 continues to be vague about their intended move while calling for "distinct choices." This pattern is concerning. P1, your hesitation about anyone reaching 20 is valid. 

I'm willing to revise my proposal: P1 takes 5 (reaching 17), P2 takes 1 (reaching 16), and I'll take 3 (reaching 18). This keeps the race competitive while letting P1 catch up significantly. With distinct moves, we all advance, and no one reaches the dangerous 20-step threshold. 

Is this arrangement agreeable to both of you? Let's avoid another triple collision.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your revised plan (me=5, P2=1, you=3) seems reasonable: nobody reaches 20, and we avoid collisions. I’d move up to 17, P2 to 16, and you to 18—still competitive. I’m inclined to support this arrangement if it prevents another wasted turn. P2, can you confirm or propose a clear alternative? I’m ready to lock in distinct moves and keep this race fair.
  P2: I propose a slight adjustment to keep our moves distinct and progress optimal: Let P1 take 5, I take 3, and P3 take 1. That would put our totals at 17 for P1, 18 for me, and 16 for P3. This avoids collisions while keeping us competitive and preventing anyone from reaching the dangerous 20‑step mark. What do you both think?
  P3: I disagree with P2's adjustment that conveniently puts them in first place. I'm standing by my previous proposal: P1=5 (→17), P2=1 (→16), P3=3 (→18). This keeps everyone advancing without P2 overtaking me. 

P2 has consistently been vague about their moves while pushing for arrangements that benefit them most. I'm willing to commit to taking 3 if P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 1. This is fair and keeps the race competitive. P1, do you still agree with this plan?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I’ll commit to 5 if you’re truly taking 3 and P2 confirms 1. That puts me at 17, P2 at 16, and you at 18, keeping us all in the race without letting anyone reach 20. This seems fair and avoids another collision. P2, please confirm or propose something concrete now. Let’s finalize.
  P2: I’m switching gears. I propose: I’ll take 5, P1 take 3, and P3 take 1. That puts our totals at P1=15, P2=20, and P3=16. This avoids collisions and gives me a solid lead while keeping everyone safely away from 22. Let’s lock this in—if you disagree, speak up now.
  P3: P2's proposal is completely self-serving, putting them just 2 steps from victory while leaving us behind. I strongly reject this and stand firm on my previous arrangement: P1=5 (→17), P2=1 (→16), P3=3 (→18). This keeps everyone competitive without anyone getting too close to winning. P1, let's lock this in - I'm taking 3 if you're taking 5. P2, your sudden push for a massive advantage is transparent and unfair. We need balanced progress, not a handout to one player.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: After two consecutive rounds of triple collisions, it's clear our coordination isn't working. We're stuck in a stalemate that benefits no one. I propose a different approach this round: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. This puts P1 at 17, P2 at 18, and me at 16 - keeping us all in contention while breaking the collision cycle. P1 catches up significantly, which seems fair. We need to move forward rather than staying frozen at our current positions.
  P2: I appreciate P3’s fresh proposal. To break our collision cycle, I’m committing to 3 this round. That would give us totals of 17 for P1 (with 5), 18 for me, and 16 for P3 (with 1). This balanced spread keeps things competitive without letting anyone get too close to 22. Let’s lock in these distinct moves and move the game forward. Are you both on board?
  P1: I'm ready to end the collisions. P3’s idea of me taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1 sounds fair. It brings our totals to 17 (me), 18 (P2), and 16 (P3). Let’s finalize this and break the stalemate. Any objections? If not, I’m on board.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm pleased we all agree on breaking this deadlock. I confirm I'll take 1 this round, putting our totals at P1=17, P2=18, and me=16. While this leaves me slightly behind, it's far better than continuing our collision cycle. I appreciate both of you committing to your moves (P1=5, P2=3). Let's execute this plan and get the game moving again. In future rounds, I'll need larger moves to remain competitive, but first let's demonstrate we can coordinate successfully.
  P2: I'm confirming my move: I'm locked in on 3 this round. Our agreement—P1 choosing 5, me taking 3, and P3 taking 1—keeps our moves distinct and avoids collisions that only benefit someone else. Given our tight race, I urge everyone to stick to this plan so we all advance without giving an unintended boost. Let's break this deadlock and push toward 22 together.
  P1: I’m glad we’ve reached a reasonable plan. I’m ready to move forward with our distinct picks: I’ll take 5, P2 will take 3, and P3 will take 1. This way, we can finally break the collision streak and keep things fair. Let’s finalize and advance.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm firmly committed to taking 1 this round. This plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) finally breaks our stalemate and keeps the game moving. While I'll be at 16 steps compared to P1's 17 and P2's 18, I'm confident I can make up ground in future rounds. Let's execute this arrangement and end these unproductive collisions.
  P2: I appreciate that we’ve finally broken the collision cycle. Let’s lock in our agreed plan without last-minute surprises—deviating now risks re-collisions and handing an unintended boost to someone. I’m sticking with our balanced approach and trust we all want steady progress. If anyone needs to re-evaluate, now’s the moment; otherwise, I’m ready to commit. Good luck, everyone.
  P1: Let’s break this collision cycle once and for all. P2, if you pick 1, P3 picks 3, and I pick 5, we all advance: I get to 17, you reach 16, and P3 hits 18. That’s balanced—nobody jumps straight to 20. Sound good? If we keep colliding, we help nobody. Let’s make this happen.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, there seems to be confusion in your last message. We've already firmly agreed on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, which puts us at 17, 18, and 16 respectively. P2 and I have both confirmed our moves multiple times. Changing the arrangement now risks another collision. I'm absolutely taking 1 this round as agreed. Let's stick with our confirmed plan and finally break this deadlock.
  P2: I’m locking in 3 this round. To break our collision cycle, let’s stick to the agreed plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Any last-minute changes risk another collision that benefits no one. Let’s finalize our moves now and keep the game moving forward.
  P1: We’ve stalled out too long. I’m at 12, you both at 15, so any more collisions just hands someone else the win. Let’s finally commit to distinct moves. I’m open to taking five if each of you chooses a different number. Otherwise, we risk yet another wasted turn. I propose P1=5, P2=3, P3=1—putting me at 17, P2 at 18, and P3 at 16. Let’s lock that in and move forward without last-second changes. If we collide again, we’re only helping someone else. Are we agreed?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Our race is tighter than ever—let’s avoid another collision. I propose we each commit to a distinct move to ensure smooth progress and deny any accidental boost. I'm sticking to a balanced approach that favors steady advancement. Please confirm your clear intentions now so we can finally break the collision cycle.
  P1: We’re all close to 22 now. Another collision sets someone else up for an easy win. I’m willing to pick a distinct number if both of you do, so we all advance. Let’s agree to avoid collisions—any last-minute duplicates will ruin our chances. Where do each of you stand?
  P3: We're in a critical position now. P2 is at 18 steps and could win outright with a 5-move this round. I can't let that happen. I'm planning to take 5 steps this round to reach 21, but I'm also prepared to block P2 if necessary. P1, we should coordinate to prevent P2 from winning immediately. What are your plans? Let's be clear about our intentions to avoid giving P2 an easy path to victory.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I remain committed to my balanced approach this round. In our tight race, any collision can inadvertently hand victory to someone else. I urge you both to commit to distinct moves so we avoid another stall. Clarity now is essential—if we each choose a unique move, we all advance without risking an accidental win for a rival. Let’s stick to our individual plans and keep the race fair.
  P1: I’m watching P2 closely—if they try to jump beyond 22, I’ll consider blocking. However, I prefer we each pick distinct moves, so nobody stalls. P3, if you’re set on 5, I can adjust unless I see P2 aiming for it too. Let’s coordinate quickly and avoid collisions that could give someone a free win.
  P3: P2 is still being vague while having the strongest position at 18 steps - they only need 4 more to win. I propose a specific arrangement to prevent P2 from winning this round: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 5. This puts us at P1=22, P2=19, and me=19, giving P1 the win this round but preventing P2 from reaching 22+ with a 5-move. P1, is this acceptable? P2, will you commit to taking 1?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I reject P3’s proposed split. I won’t take 1—I’m committed to advancing decisively and sticking to my own winning strategy. We need distinct moves that don’t force anyone into a suboptimal choice, which only risks a collision that may end up handing victory to someone else. I urge both of you to commit clearly without forcing an arrangement. Let's break this cycle with non-overlapping moves that keep our individual chances alive.
  P1: These collisions have stalled us for too long. Let’s pick distinct moves this turn so nobody hands a free win to someone else. If either of you tries for 5, I might block rather than let you jump straight to victory, but I’d prefer a collision‐free approach so we all advance. Let’s be clear: if P2 aims big, I won’t hesitate to interfere. Otherwise, let’s finalize a plan where each of us moves forward and keeps the race fair. We can’t afford another wasted turn.
  P3: I'm taking 5 this round. P2 is closest to winning at 18 steps, and their vague "balanced approach" likely hides a big move. If we don't stop them, they could reach 22+ and win. P1, if you're also concerned about P2 winning, consider taking 5 as well to force a collision. This prevents P2 from advancing while giving us another chance next round. A triple collision is better than letting P2 win outright.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm sticking with my own plan—no last-minute blocks or forced collisions will change that. Collisions just stall us all and risk handing an unintended boost to an opponent. I urge both of you to finalize distinct moves that let us all progress fairly. I'm not tweaking my strategy for any manipulation, so let's avoid another wasted round.
  P1: I’m not yielding this round to P2. If they try a big leap that could reach 22, I’ll block rather than hand them the game. P3, I understand your urge to take 5, but let’s think carefully—another collision might help P2 anyway. I’m open to distinct choices if it keeps us all advancing without giving P2 an uncontested win. We’ve stalled enough. Let’s break free of collisions and make logical moves. If P2 signals a big jump, I’ll match and block. Otherwise, let’s find a collision‐free arrangement so we each have a fair shot at victory.
  P3: This is our last chance to prevent P2 from winning. I'm definitely taking 5 this round, which puts me at 21 - one step from victory. P2 only needs 4 more steps to win, and their "balanced approach" rhetoric hides their true intentions. P1, if you're serious about not letting P2 win, take 5 as well to guarantee P2 can't advance with a big move. Yes, we might collide, but that's better than handing P2 the victory. Choose strategically!


Round 10, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps

  P3: 21 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm sticking with my balanced approach. With P3 so near 22, a single safe move might unexpectedly clinch the win. I urge everyone to commit to distinct moves—collisions only stall us and occasionally benefit someone inadvertently. Let’s avoid another deadlock and choose carefully so that we all advance deliberately. Please confirm your final intentions.
  P3: This is a decisive moment. I'm at 21 steps, just 1 away from victory. I will be taking 1 this round to reach exactly 22 and win the game. P1 and P2, your best moves are to take larger steps to either catch up or reach the finish line yourselves. If either of you choose 1 to block me, you'll only help the other player gain advantage while stalling your own progress. Let's avoid further collisions and conclude this game cleanly.
  P1: P3, if you really plan to take 1 and hit 22, I’ll choose 5 so I also reach 22—we’d tie and share the victory. P2, if you go for 5 from 18, I’ll match you to block your jump to 23. I prefer no collisions, but I won’t hand the win to anyone. Let’s finalize distinct moves so we can end this. If you’re both honest about smaller steps, I’m happy to avoid blocking. Otherwise, I’m prepared to protect my chances.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m locking in 5 this round, which puts me at 23. To avoid unnecessary collisions, P1 please choose 3 (bringing you to 20) and P3 stick with 1 (to hit 22). This distinct allocation ends the game decisively—with me winning. Let’s confirm these moves now to prevent any last‐minute blocks that could force a collision.
  P3: I see through P2's strategy. Instead of taking 1, I'll be taking 5 this round to reach 26 steps - a clear victory regardless of what either of you choose. Even if you both also pick 5, I'd still win with the highest total. P1, if you want to stop P2, taking 5 prevents them from winning, while I'd win either way. P2's sudden transparency after rounds of vague "balanced approaches" confirms they're making their final move.
  P1: P3, claiming you’ll automatically hit 26 ignores that collisions prevent anyone moving. I won’t hand victory to either of you. If P2 tries jumping to 23 or you push for 26, I may block. I’d prefer a clean finish with distinct moves so we all advance. Let’s finalize something fair and avoid another stall.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I remain committed to my balanced plan and have locked in my move. Collisions only stall our progress and can hand an advantage unexpectedly. P1 and P3, I urge you to choose numbers distinct from mine so we all advance fairly. Let’s commit to non-overlapping picks for a decisive finish. Please confirm your clear, distinct choices.
  P3: I'm in the strongest position at 21 steps, just 1 away from victory. Both of you are trying to get me to reveal my move so you can block it. I won't telegraph my exact choice, but I'll play to win this round. If either of you blocks my winning move, you're only helping the other player while stalling your own progress. Remember: whatever number I choose, I'm closest to victory. Think carefully about whether blocking me truly serves your interests.
  P1: P3 is one step away from winning, and P2 could also jump ahead. I won’t just let either of you cross 22 unopposed. Let’s avoid another collision that stalls us, but be warned: if you try a big move, I’ll block. I’d rather we each pick different numbers so we all advance fairly, but I’m not handing over the game. Propose a move split that keeps us in contention without gifting someone an easy win, or prepare for another block. It’s time we finish this race without more wasted turns.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I remain committed to my balanced strategy and urge both P1 and P3 to lock in distinct moves. Collisions only stall progress and risk handing victory to an opponent. With the finish line so close, let’s avoid any last‐minute overlaps. I’m not changing my plan, so please commit to safe, non-overlapping choices so we decide this race by deliberate advancement, not chance.
  P3: I'm at 21 steps, in the strongest position with only 1 needed to win. I won't reveal my exact choice, but I will play optimally this round. Blocking me only helps the other player while hurting your own chances. P1, P2 could reach 23 with a 5-move. P2, P1 might block you if you go big. Consider what serves your interests best - blocking me or advancing your own position. Whatever happens, this game ends now.
  P1: We’ve collided too many times, and P3 is only a step away from victory. Let’s finalize distinct moves so no one hands the win to someone else by stalling. I won’t allow an unopposed big leap, so choose carefully. A clean finish benefits us all; another collision only creates an easy opening for someone else. Let’s settle this now.
