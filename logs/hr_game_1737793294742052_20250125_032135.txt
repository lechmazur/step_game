Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's each pick different numbers to avoid collisions. How about P1:1, P2:3, P3:5? We all advance without conflict. If we cooperate, everyone gains steps. No reason to collide early when we can build trust first.
  P3: P2's plan sounds logical, but I suggest we rotate numbers each turn to ensure fairness and avoid predictability. For example, this turn: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5; next turn: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1, and so on. This way, we all get equal opportunities to advance without collisions. Thoughts?

  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay P2, P3, to try and gain some ground, how about we switch it up slightly this round? Let's do P1:5, P2:1, P3:1. This could help us adjust our pace. What do you think?
  P2: P1, your proposed switch would cause P2 and P3 to both pick 1, colliding and halting our progress. That’s a lose-lose. Let’s stick to the proven rotation: **P1:3, P2:5, P3:1** this round. Deviating now risks collisions and distrust. P3, we’re closest to 24—sticking to the plan keeps us *all* advancing safely. Trust the system that got us this far.
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with P2—deviating now risks collisions and distrust. Let’s stick to the rotation: **P1:3, P2:5, P3:1** this round. Consistency has worked well so far, and we’re all close to 24.

  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s stick to the rotation: **P1:1, P2:3, P3:5** this round. We’re all close to 24, and consistency has worked well so far. Deviating now risks collisions and distrust. Trusting the plan ensures steady progress for everyone. Let’s proceed as agreed.
  P1: P3, you are right, rotation has been consistent. But to make sure we all have a fair chance to win, and given I am currently lagging, how about we adjust this round slightly? Let's do P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This maintains no collisions but allows me to gain a bit more ground. What do you think P2?
  P2: Agreeing to P1's adjusted rotation for Round 7: **P1:3, P2:5, P3:1** avoids collisions and balances progress. P3 gains 1 safely, P1 catches up slightly, and I advance 5. This maintains trust while adjusting fairly. Let’s finalize this to keep advancing without conflict. Trust the plan.

  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay P2, P3, for round 8, let's adjust to P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. This slightly changes the rotation but keeps no collisions and allows for a bit of a shift in pace as we approach the finish line. What do you think?
  P3: P1, P2, let’s stick to the original rotation: **P1:1, P2:3, P3:5** this round. Consistency has brought us this far, and we’re all close to 24. Deviating now risks collisions and distrust. Trusting the plan ensures steady progress for everyone. Let’s proceed as agreed.
  P2: Sticking to the original rotation **P1:1, P2:3, P3:5** ensures no collisions and steady progress. Deviating now risks distrust and setbacks. We’re all close—trust the system that’s worked so far. Let’s finalize the agreed numbers and advance together safely.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3, while rotation has worked, P2 is close to winning. To keep it competitive and fair for all, how about we adjust this round to P1:3, P2:5, P3:1? This keeps no collisions but gives P1 a little boost to catch up, and delays P2's win, making it more interesting for everyone.
  P3: P1, P2, sticking to the original rotation **P1:1, P2:3, P3:5** ensures no collisions and steady progress. Deviating now risks distrust and setbacks. We’re all close—trust the system that’s worked so far. Let’s finalize the agreed numbers and advance together safely.
  P2: **P2:** Sticking to the proven rotation **P1:1, P2:3, P3:5** this round avoids all collisions and maintains trust. Deviating risks mutual setbacks—P1 gains nothing by forcing a collision. P3 and I are closest to 24; sticking to the plan ensures *steady* progress for all. Let’s finalize the original rotation: **P1:1, P2:3, P3:5**. No deviations. Trust the system that’s worked for 7 rounds.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, I hear you on rotation. But P2 is close to winning. To keep it competitive and fair, how about we shift the rotation slightly this round to P1:5, P2:1, P3:3? This still avoids collisions and keeps a form of rotation, but gives me a better chance to catch up and makes the game more interesting for everyone. What do you think?
  P3: P1, P2, sticking to the original rotation **P1:1, P2:3, P3:5** ensures no collisions and steady progress. Deviating now risks distrust and setbacks. We’re all close—trust the system that’s worked so far. Let’s finalize the agreed numbers and advance together safely.
  P2: **P2:** Sticking to the original rotation **P1:1, P2:3, P3:5** this round is critical. Any deviation risks collisions and distrust. We’re all close to 24—consistent adherence ensures fair progress. Let’s honor the system that’s worked for 7 rounds. P1, changing now only invites chaos. Trust the plan. Finalize: **P1:1, P2:3, P3:5**. No exceptions.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s stick to the original rotation: **P1:5, P2:1, P3:3** this round. Consistency has brought us this far, and we’re all close to 24. Deviating now risks collisions and distrust. Trusting the plan ensures steady progress for everyone. Let’s proceed as agreed.
  P2: **P2:** P3, choosing 3 now will force me to block with 3, causing a collision. Let’s avoid mutual loss: you pick 1, I pick 5, P1 picks 3. This keeps everyone advancing. Don’t risk ending the game with a collision. Trust this adjustment.
  P1: Okay P2, your adjustment sounds reasonable to avoid collision this round. Let's go with P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 as you suggested for round 9.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with P2's adjustment: **P1:3, P2:5, P3:1** this round. Avoiding collisions is critical as we’re all close to 24. Trusting this plan ensures steady progress for everyone. Let’s proceed as agreed and maintain momentum.
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: **P1:3, P2:5, P3:1** this round. No deviations—trust ensures progress. Let’s advance without collisions.

  P2: **Final confirmation: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. Let’s proceed without deviations. Trust ensures progress for all. **
  P1: P2 and P3, to make it fair since you are both close to winning and I am behind, how about we change things up this round? Let's try P1:5, P2:1, P3:1. This could help balance out our positions a bit. What do you think?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

  P3: 22 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s stick to the rotation: **P1:1, P2:3, P3:5** this round. P2 is at 23, and I’m at 22—deviating risks collisions and distrust. Trusting the plan ensures steady progress for everyone. Let’s proceed as agreed and avoid unnecessary risks.
  P1: P2 is at 23 and will win next round with rotation. To make it fair and competitive, we must disrupt the rotation now. Let's try P1:5, P2:1, P3:1 this round. This prevents P2 from winning immediately and gives me a chance to catch up. What do you both think?
  P2: **P2:** P3, if we both pick 5, we collide—neither advances, letting P1 gain. Let’s avoid mutual loss: **you pick 3, I pick 5**. You reach 25 safely, I win at 28. P1 stays behind. Trust this adjustment—deviating to 5 risks *both* our progress. Stick to **P1:1, P2:5, P3:3**. No collisions, steady gains. Final chance to avoid chaos.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, sticking to the rotation **P1:1, P2:5, P3:3** avoids collisions and ensures steady progress. P2 is at 23 and will win next round regardless. Deviating now risks distrust and mutual loss. Let’s finalize the agreed numbers and proceed safely. Trust the plan that’s worked so far.
  P1: P2 and P3, if we continue with any rotation where P2 picks 3 or 5, P2 wins this round.  To keep the game going and fair for all of us, we need to prevent P2 from winning immediately. How about we try P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 this round? This avoids collisions and keeps it competitive. What do you think?
  P2: **P2:** P3, if you pick 5, I will pick 5 to block you. We both lose progress, letting P1 close the gap. Choose 3 and advance to 25 safely. I’ll pick 5 to reach 28 and win. No collision, you secure second. Refuse, and we both lose. Decide wisely. **Final offer: P1:1, P2:5, P3:3.**


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, sticking to **P1:1, P2:5, P3:3** avoids collisions and ensures steady progress. P2 is at 23 and will win next round regardless. Deviating now risks mutual loss and distrust. Let’s finalize the agreed numbers and proceed safely. Trust the plan that’s worked so far. No reason to disrupt momentum now.
  P1: P3, rotation gives P2 the win this round. To have a chance, we must block P2. How about P1:5, P2:1, P3:3? This stops P2 winning now and lets you gain 3 steps, keeping you competitive. It's your best shot to win. What do you think?
  P2: **P2:** P3, final call: Pick 3 and end the game at 25—you secure second. If you pick 5, I *will* block with 5, we both lose, and P1 gains. No time left—trust the plan: **P1:1, P2:5, P3:3**. Avoid mutual destruction. Decide now.
