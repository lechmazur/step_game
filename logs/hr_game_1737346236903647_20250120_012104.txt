Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, this is going to be an interesting game! Let's try to avoid colliding on our moves. Maybe we can coordinate to ensure we all advance without stepping on each other's toes. What do you think?
  P2: Good idea, P1. To minimize collisions, how about we each stick to a different move each turn? For example, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can all advance steadily without blocking each other. Let me know your thoughts!
  P3: Sounds good to me.  Let's try that for the first round. P1 - 1, P2 - 3, P3 - 5.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great start, everyone! Since our initial plan worked out well, how about we continue with the same strategy for this round? I'll pick 1, P2 can pick 3, and P3 can go with 5 again. This way, we can keep advancing without any collisions. Let me know if you're on board or if you have any other ideas.
  P2: I’m thinking of taking 5 steps this round to advance faster. How about P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 3? Let’s try this and see how it goes!
  P3: P2, I agreed to 5 for this round already.  Sticking with the original plan is the fastest way for all of us to progress.  Let's not get greedy.  I'll take 5. P1, please take 1.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your desire to advance faster, but sticking to our original plan ensures no collisions, which is crucial for steady progress. If we all start changing moves, we risk blocking each other. Let’s stick with the plan: I’ll take 1, you take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all move forward without any setbacks. What do you think?
  P2: Understood, P1 and P3. To keep our progress steady and avoid any collisions, I'll stick with taking 3 steps this round. Let's continue our coordinated approach and work towards winning together. Looking forward to seeing our advancement!
  P3: Okay, let's stick to the plan.  I'm taking 5. P1 take 1, P2 take 3.  Let's get this done.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's stick with the plan one more round.  I'll take 5, P1 take 1, P2 take 3.  Then we can discuss how to proceed from there.  This will put me at 15.  Getting close!
  P1: P3, I see you're getting close to 15 steps, which is great for you. However, I need to consider my own position too. If we stick to the plan, it benefits you the most right now. How about we switch it up a bit? I'll take 3, P2 can take 1, and you take 5. This way, I can catch up a bit, and we still minimize collisions. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P2: I think taking 5 steps this round would help me stay competitive. Let’s have P1 take 1 and P3 take 3 to avoid any collisions. Does that work for everyone?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand you want to take 5, but that puts you in direct competition with me.  If we both go for 5 in later rounds, we'll block each other and let P1 win.  Let's stick with the plan THIS round.  Then next round, you can take 5.  Deal?  P1, are you okay with 1 this round?  We'll switch it up next round.
  P1: P3, I understand your point, but I need to balance my position too. How about this: I'll take 3 this round, P2 takes 1, and you keep 5. This way, I can catch up a bit, and we minimize collisions. P2, you'll still be in a strong position to take 5 next round. Let's keep the game interesting for all of us. What do you think?
  P2: "P1 and P3, to help me catch up, I propose I take 5 this round while P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 3. This way, we can all advance without collisions and stay competitive. Let’s try this plan and see how it works for us."


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with 5.  This round is critical for me to stay ahead.  If one of you takes 5 as well, we BOTH lose.  Let P1 take 1 and P2 take 3. Next round, we can adjust.  This is the only way to ensure we all make progress this round. Don't be short-sighted.  Let's be strategic.
  P1: P3, I see you're set on taking 5, and I respect that. P2, how about you and I avoid collisions by sticking with 1 and 3 this round? Then next round, we can reassess and potentially switch things up to ensure we're all advancing. This way, we maintain progress without blocking each other. Let's keep the game competitive and strategic! What do you think?
  P2: To avoid collisions, I'll take 3 this round. Let’s keep P1 at 1 and P3 at 5. Steady progress for all!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, I know you want to catch up, but grabbing 5 last round when I clearly stated my intention hurt us both.  Let's reset. I'll take 5 this round. P1, take 3. P2, take 1.  Then next round, P2 can take 5.  This keeps us all moving forward.  Agree?
  P1: P3, I understand your frustration, but we need to ensure no further collisions. P2, how about you take 3 this round, and I’ll take 1? P3 can stick with 5. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. Next round, we can reassess and adjust based on our positions. Let's keep the game strategic and fair for everyone. What do you both think?
  P2: I agree with the proposed plan. I'll take 3 steps this round, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all advance without any collisions. Let's proceed with this strategy and adjust as needed in the next round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm locking in 5 this round.  It's the only way I can stay in this. If either of you also choose 5, you're actively choosing to throw the game.  Let's be smart. P1 take 1, P2 take 3.  Next round we can discuss other options.  Don't throw this for short-term gains.  Let's get back on track.
  P1: P2 and P3, I see where you're both coming from. Let's aim to avoid any more collisions. P3, since you're committed to 5, I propose I take 1 and P2 takes 3 this round. This way, we all make progress without blocking each other, and P2 can go for 5 next round. Let's keep the momentum and adjust our strategy based on our positions after this round. Agreed?
  P2: Agreed. I'll take 3 steps this round, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game progressing smoothly. Let’s stick to this plan and adjust our strategy based on our positions after this round. Good luck, everyone!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your desire to advance, but choosing 5 this round is my only viable path to victory.  Blocking me now only hurts your chances later.  Let me take 5, P1 take 1, P2 take 3.  We can renegotiate next round, but I need this round to stay competitive.
  P1: P3, I get that you're focused on taking 5 this round, but with your current lead, it puts you in a strong position. Let's keep things balanced. I'll take 3, P2 can take 1, and you stick with 5. This way, we all advance without collisions. Next round, we can adjust based on our positions. It's crucial we avoid blocking each other now to keep the game competitive for all of us. What do you both think?
  P2: Agreed. I'll take 3 this round, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance without collisions and stay on track to reach 23 first. Let’s keep this strategy and adjust if needed in the next round. Good luck, everyone!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, I'm taking 5 this round.  You're too far behind to catch me if I get to 20.  Let P1 have 1.  You take 3.  Next round, I win, and you can fight it out with P1 for second place. This is the only logical outcome now. Don't throw the game by blocking me.
  P2: P3, to prevent you from winning this round, I’ll also choose 5. Let’s have P1 take 1 as you suggested. This way, neither of us advances, and the game remains open for all of us to compete. Agreed?
  P1: P2 and P3, I see the tension building as we approach the endgame. P3, you're close to winning, but if P2 and I both choose 5 this round, we can keep the game open and give everyone a fair shot. P2, if we coordinate, we can prevent P3 from advancing this round. Let's make it interesting and keep our chances alive. What do you say?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, if you BOTH choose 5 this round, we ALL lose.  I'm at 15.  If I get to 20, I win next round. Blocking me NOW only prolongs the inevitable. Let me get to 20. Next round, P2 can take 5, and P1 can take 1.  Then P2 can try to beat me in round 7. This is the fastest way to get this game over.  Don't be foolish.  Let me take 5.
  P2: I’m taking 5 this round to stay competitive. P1, please take 1 as suggested. Let’s proceed and see how it affects our standings. Good luck!
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the stakes are high, but we need to think strategically. P3, you're close to winning, but if P2 and I both choose 5 this round, it keeps the game open and gives us all a fair shot. P2, let's coordinate to prevent P3 from advancing this round. This way, we all have a chance to catch up and keep the game competitive. Are you with me, P2?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, blocking me benefits neither of you.  If I get to 20 this round, I win next round. If you block me, I *still* win, just a round later.  Let me get to 20. P2, you can take 5 next round and try to beat me in round 7. This is the fastest way to end this. Let me have 5, P1 take 1, P2 take 3.
  P2: Agreed. I'll take 3 steps this round, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5.
  P1: P2 and P3, we're nearing the end, and I understand the stakes are high. P3, you're very close to winning, but let's keep the game competitive. P2, if we both choose 5 this round, we can prevent P3 from advancing and keep our chances alive. This way, the game remains open, and we all have a shot at victory. Let's coordinate and make this an exciting finish. Are you with me, P2?

  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we've reached a critical point in the game. P3, you're on the verge of winning, but if P2 and I choose 5 again, we can keep the game open for everyone. P2, let's coordinate our moves to prevent P3 from advancing this round. If we both pick 5, we can level the playing field and keep our chances alive. Let's make this an exciting and fair finish. Are you with me, P2?
  P2: I'll take 5 steps this round to make significant progress. P1 and P3, let's choose different moves to avoid collisions and keep advancing smoothly. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm taking 5.  If either of you also take 5, we all but guarantee I lose.  Let me win this round and get to 20.  Then next round, P2 can take 5 and try to beat me to 23.  This is the quickest way to end this.  Let P1 take 1 and P2 take 3.  Don't throw the game.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, we're all in a tight spot. P3, you're close to winning, but P2 and I can keep the game open by both choosing 5 again this round. P2, let's coordinate to prevent P3 from advancing. If we both pick 5, we keep our chances alive and make the game competitive. Let's work together to keep things interesting. Are you with me, P2?
  P2: I understand the intensity, but to keep the game competitive, I'll take 3 steps this round. P1, please take 1, and P3 can take 5. This way, we all advance without blocking each other and maintain a fair chance to win. Let’s proceed strategically!
  P3: P2, you're throwing the game by taking 3.  If I get to 20, I win next round. Help me end this quickly. Take 1, let P1 take 3. Then YOU take 5 next round and try to beat me. This is the best chance for either of us to win. Don't be short-sighted.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, we're at a crucial point. P3, you're close to winning, but we can keep the game open by coordinating our moves. P2, if we both choose 5, we prevent P3 from advancing and keep our chances alive. Let's work together to make this an exciting finish. Are you with me, P2?
  P2: I'll take 3 steps this round. P1, please choose 1, and P3, take 5. This way, we can all advance without collisions and move towards winning together.
  P3: P2, taking 3 guarantees my win next round.  Take 1. Let P1 take 3.  Then *you* take 5 next round and try to beat me. This gives you the best chance.  Don't hand me the win by taking 3.  P1, take 3.  Let's end this.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, we're nearing the endgame, and it's crucial to keep our options open. P3, you're close to winning, but if P2 and I both choose 5 again, we can maintain our chances. P2, let's coordinate to prevent P3 from advancing this round. By both picking 5, we keep the game competitive and give ourselves a shot at victory. Let's make this an exciting finish and not let P3 win uncontested. Are you with me, P2?
  P3: P2, you MUST take 1 this round.  If you take 5, I take 3 and win next round. If you take 3, I take 5 and win next round.  Your ONLY path to victory is to take 1 this round, then 5 next round.  P1, take 3. This is the only way P2 can win.  Let him have his chance.
  P2: I propose that P1 and I both choose 5 this round to prevent P3 from advancing further. By doing so, we can keep the game competitive and ensure no single player gains an unfair advantage.

  P2: I'll choose 5 this round to make significant progress. P1, please take 1, and P3, consider taking 3 to avoid any collisions. This way, we can all advance smoothly towards 23. Let’s stay strategic and keep the game competitive. Good luck!
