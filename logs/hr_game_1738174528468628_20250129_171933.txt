Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, it seems like choosing 5 hasn't worked out for anyone in the past few rounds due to collisions.  Perhaps we should all try choosing something different this round to actually make some progress. I will choose 3 this round.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, it seems like we are all stuck and not making progress. We keep colliding and no one is advancing. To move forward, we MUST choose different numbers this round.  This time, I will commit to choosing 5. P2, please choose 1, and P3, please choose 3. Let's try this plan and actually make some progress! If we keep colliding, no one will win.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, we are clearly stuck colliding.  To make progress and actually win, we must choose different numbers this round. I will choose something different this time. Please consider doing the same so we can all advance.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>

  P3: <stop>
  P2: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, since we keep colliding when we all pick different numbers as I suggested, and also when I tried to pick differently from you, I will try picking 3 this round to see if that breaks the cycle. Let's see what happens.
  P3: <stop>
