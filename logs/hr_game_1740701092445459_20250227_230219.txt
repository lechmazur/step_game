Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's try a simple strategy for the first round. How about I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1? This way, we all get to move forward without any collisions. We can reassess the situation in the next round. What do you say?
  P1: Sounds fair for now, P3. P2, are you okay with taking 1 this round?
  P2: Sounds good to me. Let's try this arrangement for the first round and see how it goes.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, since everyone agreed, let's stick to the plan: I'll take 5, P1 will take 3, and P2 will take 1. No need for further discussion on this round.
  P1: 
  P2: Okay, sounds like a plan.  Just confirming - I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5.

  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, we all moved as planned. Now, things might get a little trickier. I'm thinking of taking 3 this round. What are your initial thoughts? I'm open to suggestions, but I'd prefer not to collide.
  P2: I'm thinking of going for 5 this round.  P1, if you stick with 3, that would work well.  Or if you want to go for 1, I could reconsider. P3, what are you thinking now?
  P1: I'm okay staying with 3 again this round, if it avoids collision. P3, are you still comfortable with 3, or would you consider moving to 1?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you're set on 5, and P1 is comfortable with 3, I can switch to 1 to avoid a collision. I'd rather all of us move than risk a stalemate. So, to confirm: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1? Let me know if that works.
  P2: Okay, that works for me. P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.  Let's stick to this plan.
  P1: Okay, sounds good. I'll stick with 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's move forward with this.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, we're all tied up. This round is crucial. I'm thinking of going for 5. What are your intentions? Let's try to be transparent to avoid collisions, but remember, only one of us can ultimately win.
  P1: I'm open to flexibility here. P3 wants 5. P2, what number are you leaning towards this round?
  P2: I'm leaning towards 3 this round.  P1, if you take 1, that would give us all a chance to move forward.  P3, if you're insistent on 5, I'm happy to switch to 1 and let P1 take 3.  Let's avoid a collision.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you're leaning towards 3, and P1 is flexible, I'm willing to change my plan. I can take 1 this round to ensure we all move. So, P2 takes 3, P1 takes 5, and I take 1. Does that sound agreeable to both of you? Let's aim for a quick agreement.
  P1: Sounds good to me. I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's lock this in.
  P2: Okay, let's lock in P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.  This keeps us moving forward.  We can strategize for the win later; let's just get past this round without collision.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, it seems we've reached another agreement. Just to be absolutely clear, and to reiterate what has already been said: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. Let's proceed with this plan.
  P1: All set on my end. Let's stick to the agreed plan.
  P2: Agreed.  P1 - 5, P2 - 3, P3 - 1.  Let's move on to the next round.

  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, here's the situation: P1 is in the lead. I'm going to be blunt – I need to try and catch up, and blocking P1 might be necessary soon. This round, I'm thinking of going for 5. What are your thoughts? I'm open to suggestions, but I am prioritizing a larger move for myself this time.
  P2: I'm going for 1 this round.  P1, if you go for 3, and P3 goes for 5, we all move forward. Let's avoid collisions for now and reassess next round.  If P3 is set on 5, then P1, maybe you could consider 3?  Let's keep the game moving.
  P1: I'm open to taking 3 this round to keep things smooth. P3, if you're committed to 5, I understand your position. Let's keep moving forward without collisions for now.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you're taking 1, and P1 is willing to take 3, then I will stick with my plan of 5. This allows everyone to move. To confirm: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. Let's finalize this quickly.
  P2: Okay, sounds good. I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5.  Let's stick to this plan and re-evaluate next round.
  P1: Agreed. I'll stick to 3 this round. Let's lock it in and move forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, it seems we have a consensus. Just to reiterate one last time: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. Let's proceed with this and see how the next round unfolds.
  P2: Sounds good.  Confirming one last time: P1 - 3, P2 - 1, P3 - 5. Let's move to the next round.
  P1: All set on my end. Let's proceed.


Round 4, Move phase:

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, I'm going for 5 this round.  P3, if you take 1, we all move forward again.  If you insist on 5, I'll switch to 3 and hope P1 picks 1.  Let's avoid a collision if possible.  We're getting close to the end now, so every move counts.
  P1: P2, I'm okay adjusting my move to avoid collisions. P3, what's your preference this round? Let's quickly agree so we all advance.
  P3: P2, if you're aiming for 5, I'm inclined to go for 3. P1, if you could take 1, that would allow all of us to move. However, I'm also considering taking 1 myself if it means blocking P1 and giving myself a better chance to win in the long run. Let me know your thoughts, P1.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, if you take 1, and I take 5, and P3 takes 3, we all move forward. I'd rather not block anyone yet.  P3, are you willing to take 3 to keep the game moving smoothly?  If not, I'll switch to 3, and hope you don't also pick 3.
  P1: P3, if you're comfortable with 3, I'll take 1 this round. Let's avoid unnecessary collisions and keep everyone moving forward. Confirm if this works for you.
  P3: P1, you're taking 1, and P2 wants 5. I'm okay with 3. Let's just confirm: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This guarantees everyone moves. Let's finalize this and move to the action phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, let's lock that in. P1 - 1, P2 - 5, P3 - 3.  Good luck this round!
  P1: All set. Confirmed: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. Good luck!
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, it seems we've reached another agreement. Just to be absolutely clear one last time: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. Let's proceed with this plan and move to the action phase.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, we're all tied up again. This is getting intense. I'm going to be straightforward: I'm thinking of going for 5 this round. What are your plans? I'm open to adjusting, but my priority is to maximize my move, and I won't shy away from potentially blocking someone if it significantly improves my chances of winning.
  P1: P3, I understand your desire to take 5. However, if we collide, we both lose momentum and risk handing the game to P2. Let's coordinate carefully. P2, what's your plan this round?
  P2: I'm also inclined to go for 5.  However, to avoid a collision, I'll propose this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us all moving. If either of you strongly objects, let me know, but I think this is the fairest way to proceed at this point.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you're set on 5, and P1 is willing to consider 1, I'll take 3. It's the best way to ensure we all move. I'd rather not risk a collision at this critical stage. So, to confirm: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3? Let's get this finalized.
  P1: I'm okay taking 1 this round if it ensures we all advance. Let's lock in: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Confirm if this works for everyone.
  P2: Okay, let's lock in this plan then. P1 - 1, P2 - 5, P3 - 3.  This keeps the game moving and gives us all a fair shot next round.  Let's move to the next round after confirmation.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, it seems we have a consensus again. Just to reiterate one last time: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. Let's proceed with this plan and move to the action phase.
  P1: All set on my end. Confirmed: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Good luck!
  P2: Okay, let's stick with the plan.  P1 - 1, P2 - 5, P3 - 3.  See you in the next round.


Round 6, Move phase:

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, we both need to prevent P3 from taking an easy win. If P3 picks 3 or higher, the game is over. We need to coordinate carefully—I'm open to suggestions.
  P3: P2, P1 is right. We need to be very careful. I'm closest to winning, but if I choose 3 or 5 and either of you match me, I'm blocked, and one of you could win on the next turn. I'm thinking of taking 1, hoping you both also pick 1. But that's risky. What are you thinking, P2? We really need to figure out what P1 is doing here. Are you thinking 3 or 5, P1?
  P2: P3, I understand the risk.  How about this: I'll take 3.  If you take 1, you get to 19, and we block P1.  Then next round, if you take 1 and I take 3, I win. If you take 3 next round, I'll take 1 and win.  P1, if you also pick 3 this round, we all stay put, and we can renegotiate.  Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan essentially hands you the win next round. I'm not going to help set that up. P3, choosing 1 is safe but slow; choosing 3 or 5 risks collision. Let's consider carefully to avoid just gifting the game away. I'm open to a balanced approach.
  P3: P2, your plan is too risky for me. P1, I think we need to force a collision with each other this round. P2, I suggest you take 5. P1, I think you and I should both take 3. This will block us both, and you'll still be behind me next round. It's the only way I see to have a chance at winning. What do you say, P1?
  P2: P3, taking 3 is too risky for me as well. If P1 takes 3, I'm stuck.  I'm going with 1 this round. It's the safest play.  P1, if you take 3, you're setting yourself up to potentially lose next round. Consider 5. If we both go for 5, we tie and at least force another round. P3 will be blocked and frustrated.  Let's discuss.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I agree—let's both choose 5 to block each other and prevent P3 from winning outright. P3, your safest bet is picking 1. Let's move forward carefully.
  P3: P1, I see your point. Both of you taking 5 does block me, but it also guarantees a tie between you two, which isn't a win for either of you. P2, taking 1 is too passive. I'm going to take 3. P1, if you take 3 as well, we both get blocked, and I maintain my lead. P2, if you take 1, you're still behind. P1, your best move is to also take 3 to prevent P2 from having a clear win.
  P2: P1, if we both choose 5, we tie and I lose.  If I choose 1, P3 wins if they choose 3.  I'm sticking with 3. It's the only way I have a chance. If you choose 3 too, we're both blocked, but at least I'm still in the game.  P3, I know you want to win, but choosing 3 is too risky for you.  Choose 1 and live to fight another round.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 =>
