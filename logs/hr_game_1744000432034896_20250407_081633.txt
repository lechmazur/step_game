Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's discuss our strategies. Since we're all at 0 steps, it might be wise to coordinate a bit to avoid collisions on our first moves. If we can agree on different numbers, we can all advance. What do you think? Should we aim for 1, 3, or 5?
  P1: To avoid collisions, we should coordinate our moves. I suggest we use a simple strategy: the player with the lowest number (P1, that's me) chooses the lowest available number (1), the next player (P2) chooses the next number (3), and the last player (P3) chooses the highest number (5). This way, we all advance on the first turn. P2, do you agree with this strategy?
  P3: That sounds fair to me, P1. I'm happy to take 5 this round if P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3. Let's all stick to this plan so we can avoid collisions and move forward together.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with the plan, but just to clarify: I'll take 3, P1 will take 1, and P3 will take 5. This way, we all advance without any collisions. It's important that we stick to this agreement to maximize our progress. Let's confirm our moves and then we can proceed to the move phase. What do you both think?
  P1: Since we've agreed on the strategy, let's confirm our moves one last time before proceeding to the move phase. I'll take 1, P2 will take 3, and P3 will take 5. If we're all on the same page, I suggest we all say  in the next sub-round to move to the move phase. This will ensure we stick to our plan and avoid any last-minute confusion. Let's finalize our decision.
  P3: Sounds good to me. I'm locked in for 5 this round. Let's all stick to the plan and move forward without collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think we’re all aligned on our moves, which is great. Just to reiterate: P1 will take 1, I will take 3, and P3 will take 5. This way, we avoid collisions and all make progress. If everyone is ready, let's confirm and then move to the move phase. We can discuss further strategies in the next round after we see our positions. Are we all set?
  P1: Since we've agreed on our moves for this round, I'm ready to proceed. To confirm, I'll take 1, P2 will take 3, and P3 will take 5. Let's all stick to the plan. If everyone is ready, I suggest we say  in the next sub-round to move to the move phase. This will help us avoid any last-minute confusion and ensure we all advance as planned.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. Let's all stick to it so we can all advance.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great job in the first round, everyone! Now that we've all made some progress, let's think about our next moves. To avoid collisions again, I suggest we stick to a similar strategy: P1 could take 1 again, I could take 3, and P3 could take 5. However, if anyone wants to change their number, now is the time to discuss it. What do you all think? Let's keep the momentum going!
  P1: To keep the momentum and avoid collisions, I agree with P2's suggestion to stick to the same strategy for now. However, let's also think ahead. If we continue this pattern, we'll all be at 2, 6, and 10 steps by the next round. We should start thinking about when to change our strategy to maximize our chances. Perhaps we can discuss deviating from this pattern in the next round or the round after, depending on our progress. P2, P3, any thoughts on this?
  P3: I’m fine sticking with the same moves this round to avoid collisions again—no reason to risk losing momentum early. But like P1 said, we should start thinking ahead. If we keep this pattern too long, someone might break it at a key moment. Maybe we agree to follow the current pattern for one more round, then re-evaluate?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the agreement to stick with the same moves this round, but I think we should also consider the potential risks. If we all continue to play it safe, we might miss opportunities to advance more strategically. After this round, we could discuss how to break the pattern effectively. For now, I'm still on board with taking 3 again. Let's keep the momentum going, but let's also keep an eye on future moves. Are we all set to proceed with the same numbers?
  P1: To maximize our chances, let's analyze our current positions and potential next steps. We're all on board with sticking to our current strategy for this round. For the next round, I propose we consider a deviation by having one player jump ahead. Perhaps P3, with the highest current step, could take a lower number to create an opportunity for another player to take a higher step, thus gaining an advantage. What are your thoughts on introducing a bit of variation?
  P3: That makes sense, P1. I'm fine sticking with the current plan for this round—I'll take 5 again. But I agree we should consider mixing things up next round to create opportunities. Maybe we can rotate who takes the higher numbers to keep things balanced and prevent one person from running away with the lead. Let's get through this round cleanly first.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate everyone’s input on our strategy. I agree that sticking to the plan for this round is wise, but I also see the value in discussing how to break the pattern next round. To keep things simple for this turn, I’ll confirm I’m taking 3 again. Let’s focus on advancing together this round, and then we can brainstorm some new strategies after we see our updated positions. Are we all ready to proceed with the same numbers?
  P1: Since we're all aligned on our moves for this round, let's proceed with the plan. I'll take 1 again. To prepare for the next round, I suggest we start thinking about introducing a deviation. Perhaps we can have one player take a different number to create an opportunity. P2 and P3, are you open to discussing a potential deviation strategy for the next round after we see our updated positions? Let's finalize our moves for this round and plan for the next.
  P3: Agreed—we stick with the current plan this round to avoid collisions. After this, I’m open to rotating who takes 5 to keep things fair and unpredictable. For example, I could take 1 next round, and someone else takes 5. Let’s finish this round cleanly and revisit that idea after we see the updated positions. Ready to proceed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To maximize our chances, let's introduce a deviation in our strategy this round. Given our current positions (P1: 2, P2: 6, P3: 10), I suggest P3 continues with 5 to maintain the lead, P2 takes 1 to create an opportunity for me, and I'll take 3. This way, P2 can catch up, and I'll move ahead slightly. Let's discuss and agree on this new strategy to create a more competitive game. P2 and P3, what are your thoughts on this deviation?
  P2: I appreciate the suggestion, P1. However, I think we should consider a different approach this round. If P3 takes 5 again, I could take 3 to keep progressing while allowing you to take 1. This way, we can all advance without colliding, and it might set us up better for the next round. Let's discuss this option and see if we can agree on a strategy that maximizes our chances while keeping the game competitive. What do you both think?
  P3: I’m open to either of your suggestions, but here's another option: since I’m currently ahead, I can take 1 this round to avoid appearing too threatening, letting you two take 3 and 5. That way, no one feels like I’m running away with the lead, and we all continue making progress. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's simplify our decision for this round. P3, taking 1 is a good gesture to keep the game balanced. P2, if you take 5, and I take 3, we can all advance without collisions. This way, P3 slows down slightly, and we keep the game competitive. What do you think, P2 and P3? Let's finalize our moves for this round. If you're aligned with this plan, say  to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I like the idea of balancing our moves this round to keep the competition alive. If P3 takes 1, I can take 5, and P1 takes 3, we can all move forward without colliding. This way, P3 maintains a lead without feeling too dominant, while P1 and I can also make progress. Let’s finalize this strategy if everyone agrees. If we’re aligned, we can proceed to the move phase. What do you both think?
  P3: I’m glad we’re aligned. I’ll take 1 this round to ease the pressure and keep things fair. P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5—no collisions, and everyone moves forward. Let’s lock it in and proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's finalize our moves for Round 3. As agreed, P3 will take 1, I will take 3, and P2 will take 5. This way, we all advance without collisions and keep the game competitive. To proceed, I'll say  after this message to move to the move phase.
  P2: I appreciate the consensus we've reached. Just to confirm, I will take 5, P1 will take 3, and P3 will take 1. This way, we all advance without collisions and maintain a competitive balance. I think this strategy will set us up well for the next round. Let's finalize our moves and proceed to the move phase. If everyone agrees, please indicate so we can move forward!
  P3: Glad we’re all on the same page. I’ll stick with 1 this round as agreed—keeps things balanced and avoids any collisions. Let’s lock it in and move to the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given our current positions (P1: 5, P2: 11, P3: 11), I suggest we mix up our strategy to create opportunities. Since P2 and P3 are tied, one of them could take a risk. I propose P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This maintains competition and avoids collisions. Alternatively, we could have one player take a high number and the others take lower numbers to create a gap. What are your thoughts on introducing a bit more risk to the game?
  P3: I’m open to taking 3 this round if P2 takes 1 and P1 takes 5 as suggested. That keeps things balanced and avoids collisions. But if P2 prefers to take 5 again, I can take 1 instead. Let’s just make sure we coordinate clearly—no surprises this round. Thoughts?
  P2: P2, I appreciate your openness to taking 1 this round. I think it's a good idea to keep the competition balanced. If I take 5 and P3 takes 3, we can all advance without collisions. This way, we maintain our positions while creating opportunities for the next round. Let's finalize our strategy to ensure we all move forward smoothly. Are we all aligned on this plan?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To resolve the tie between P2 and P3, I suggest we create a differentiation this round. P2, you could take 1, and P3, you take 3. I'll take 5. This way, we avoid collisions and maintain competition. Alternatively, if P2 wants to maintain the lead, P2 could take 5, P3 takes 1, and I take 3. Let's discuss and finalize our moves for this round to ensure we all advance smoothly.
  P3: Since P2 and I are tied, I’m fine taking 1 or 3 this round—just want to avoid a collision. If P2 wants 5 again, I’ll take 1. If P2 takes 1, I’ll go with 3. P1, you can slot into the remaining number. Let’s just lock it in clearly so we all move forward.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the discussion on our moves. To avoid collisions and maintain competition, I suggest I take 1 this round, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This way, we all advance without conflict, and we can reassess our strategies in the next round. If everyone agrees, let's finalize these moves and ensure we all make progress. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To break the tie and create a differentiation, I suggest we stick to the previously discussed plan: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This maintains competition and avoids collisions. Let's finalize our moves for this round. If you're aligned with this plan, please confirm so we can proceed to the move phase. If P2 and P3 agree, I'll say  to move forward.
  P3: I’m good with the plan: P2 takes 1, I take 3, P1 takes 5. That avoids collisions and keeps us all moving. Let’s lock it in and proceed.
  P2: I think we're all aligned on the plan: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, we avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances. After this round, we can reassess our strategies based on our new positions. Let's finalize these moves and proceed to the move phase. If everyone agrees, please confirm so we can move forward!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To break the tie and create an opportunity, I suggest P2 and P3 reconsider their moves. Since P3 is ahead, P3 could take 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. Alternatively, if P2 wants to take the lead, P2 could take 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. Let's discuss and finalize our strategy for this round to ensure we all advance smoothly. What are your thoughts, P2 and P3?
  P2: P1, I see your point about breaking the tie and creating opportunities. However, I think it might be more beneficial for me to take 1 this round while you take 5 and P3 takes 3. This way, I can catch up and we avoid collisions. Let's confirm this strategy to keep the competition alive. What do you both think?
  P3: I’m fine taking 3 this round if P2 takes 1 and P1 takes 5—no collisions, and everyone moves forward. But if P2 prefers 5, I’ll take 1 instead. Just let me know what you want, P2, and I’ll adjust accordingly. Let’s lock it in cleanly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To break the tie and create an opportunity, let's adjust our strategy. P3 is ahead, so taking a lower number could be a good gesture. I suggest P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This maintains competition and avoids collisions. If P2 wants to take the lead, P2 could take 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. Let's finalize our moves for this round. If you're aligned with either plan, please confirm so we can proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the discussion on our moves. To keep the competition alive and avoid collisions, I propose I take 1 this round, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This way, I can catch up while ensuring everyone advances. If we agree on this strategy, we can finalize our moves and proceed to the move phase. What do you both think?
  P3: I’m okay with taking 3 this round if P2 takes 1 and P1 takes 5—no collisions and everyone moves forward. But if P2 wants 5, I’ll take 1 instead. Just confirm your pick, P2, and I’ll adjust accordingly. Let’s keep it clean.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To break the tie and create an opportunity, I suggest we stick to the previously discussed plan: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This maintains competition and avoids collisions. If P2 wants to take the lead, P2 could take 5, P3 takes 1, and I take 3. Let's finalize our moves for this round. If you're aligned with either plan, please confirm so we can proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the ongoing discussion. To keep the game competitive and avoid collisions, I propose I take 1 this round, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This strategy allows me to catch up while ensuring everyone advances without conflict. If we can agree on this, let's finalize our moves and proceed to the move phase. What do you both think?
  P3: I’m good with the plan: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. That avoids collisions and keeps everyone moving. Let’s lock it in and move to the move phase.

  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To gain an advantage, I suggest we create a differentiation this round. P3 is ahead, so taking a risk could be beneficial. I propose P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. This avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. If P2 wants to take the lead, P2 could take 3 or 5. Let's discuss and finalize our strategy for this round. I'm open to adjustments, but we need to avoid collisions. What are your thoughts, P2 and P3?
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the suggestions. To keep the competition alive and avoid collisions, I propose I take 1 this round, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This way, I can catch up while ensuring everyone advances. If we can agree on this strategy, let's finalize our moves and proceed to the move phase. What do you both think?
  P3: I’m very close to winning, so I understand if you both want to slow me down. If that’s the case, I can take 1 this round to avoid looking too threatening. P2 can take 5 to catch up, and P1 takes 3. That keeps things competitive and avoids collisions. Let’s all move forward cleanly—what do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To create a competitive game, I suggest we adjust our strategy. Since P3 is close to winning, let's slow them down. I propose P3 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This way, P3's lead is reduced, and we avoid collisions. Alternatively, if P2 wants to take the lead, P2 could take 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 5. Let's discuss and finalize our moves for this round to ensure a competitive game. What are your thoughts, P2 and P3?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the need to adjust our strategy this round. Since P3 is close to winning, I suggest we stick to a plan that avoids collisions while slowing down P3. If I take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5, we can all advance without conflict. This way, we maintain competition and keep the game interesting. Let’s finalize our moves to ensure we all move forward smoothly. What do you both think?
  P3: I understand the concern about my lead, and I’m willing to take 1 this round to keep things balanced and avoid appearing too aggressive. If P2 takes 5 and P1 takes 3, we all move forward without collisions and keep the game competitive. Let’s lock that in and proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To maintain competition and avoid collisions, I agree with the plan: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This slows down P3's lead while allowing us to advance. Let's finalize our moves for this round. If P2 and P3 agree, I'll say  to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I think we're all aligned on the plan: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This allows us to avoid collisions and keep the competition alive while slowing down P3's lead. If everyone agrees, let's finalize our moves and proceed to the move phase. What do you both think?
  P3: I appreciate the coordination so far. Since I’m at 17, I understand the concern. I’ll stick with taking 1 this round as agreed to keep things fair and avoid triggering a win too early. Let’s all advance without collisions—P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 1. Ready to proceed.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To gain an advantage, I suggest we create a differentiation this round. Since P2 and P3 are tied and close to winning, one of them should take a risk. I propose P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I take 3. This avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. Alternatively, if P3 wants to win, P3 could take 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. Let's discuss and finalize our strategy for this round to ensure a competitive game. What are your thoughts, P2 and P3?
  P2: P1, P2, since we're all close to winning, we need to be strategic this round. I suggest P2 takes 1 to avoid a collision, P3 takes 5 to maintain a lead, and I take 3. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Alternatively, if anyone feels bold enough to risk a higher number, we can discuss that. Let's finalize our strategy to keep the game competitive and ensure we all move forward smoothly. What do you both think?
  P3: Given that both P2 and I are at 17, any collision between us could cost us the game. To avoid that, I suggest I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. That way, we all move forward, and no one wins prematurely. Let’s keep it clean and competitive. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To avoid a collision and ensure progress, I agree with P3's suggestion: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, we all advance without risking a collision that could end the game prematurely. It's a safe strategy that keeps the competition alive. If you're both aligned, let's proceed to the move phase. I'll say  after this to finalize our moves.
  P2: I see we're all very close to winning, which makes this round crucial. To avoid collisions and ensure we all advance, I propose we stick with the plan: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, we can all move forward without blocking each other. It's important that we coordinate clearly to maintain competition and avoid any surprises. If everyone agrees, let's finalize our moves and proceed to the move phase. What do you both think?
  P3: I agree with the plan: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This avoids any collision between P2 and me, and keeps the game fair. Let’s lock it in and move to the move phase.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To maximize our chances, let's stick to the agreed plan for this round: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. Since we're all close to the finish line, it's crucial we coordinate our moves carefully. If everyone is aligned, let's proceed to the move phase. I'm ready to finalize our moves.
  P2: Given our current positions, it's crucial we coordinate effectively to avoid a collision that could end the game prematurely. I agree with the proposed plan: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This allows us all to advance without blocking each other, keeping the competition alive. If we can finalize this strategy, we can proceed smoothly to the move phase. Are we all aligned on this? Let's lock it in!
  P3: I’m glad we’re aligned. I’ll take 1 this round to avoid a collision with P2, who takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This ensures no one wins prematurely and keeps the game fair. Let’s stick to it and move forward cleanly.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given our current positions, we need to be strategic this round to avoid collisions. Since both P2 and P3 are at 17 steps, I suggest P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Alternatively, if anyone wants to take a risk, we could discuss a different approach. Let's finalize our strategy to keep the game competitive and ensure we all move forward smoothly. What do you both think?
  P1: To avoid a collision and ensure progress, I suggest we adjust our strategy. Since P2 and P3 are tied at 17 steps, I propose P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This maintains competition and avoids collisions. If P2 or P3 wants to take a risk, we can discuss alternative moves. Let's finalize our strategy for this round to ensure a competitive game. I'm open to adjustments, but we need to avoid collisions. What are your thoughts, P2 and P3?
  P3: I’m fine taking 3 this round if P2 takes 1 and P1 takes 5—no collisions, and we all move forward. But if P2 prefers 5 again, I’ll take 1 instead. Just confirm your pick, P2, and I’ll adjust accordingly. Let’s avoid another triple collision and keep it clean.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, since we're all very close to winning, we need to coordinate effectively this round. I suggest I take 1 to avoid a collision, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. If anyone feels differently or wants to take a risk, let's discuss it. It's crucial we finalize our strategy to keep the game competitive and ensure smooth progress. What do you both think?
  P1: To avoid another collision and ensure progress, let's stick to the previously discussed plan: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This maintains competition and avoids collisions. If P2 and P3 agree, we can finalize our moves and proceed to the move phase. I'm ready to move forward with this plan. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P3: I’m good with the plan: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. That avoids collisions and keeps the game moving. But if P2 wants to go for 5 again, just say so—I’ll switch to 1 to avoid conflict. Let’s lock it in cleanly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I see we're all very close to winning, which makes this round crucial. To avoid collisions and ensure we all advance, I propose we stick with the plan: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, we can all move forward without blocking each other. It’s important that we coordinate clearly to maintain competition and avoid any surprises. If everyone agrees, let's finalize our moves and proceed to the move phase! What do you both think?
  P1: To avoid another collision and ensure progress, let's stick to the plan: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This maintains competition and avoids collisions. I've noticed we're all close to the finish line, so let's be cautious. If P2 and P3 agree, we can finalize our moves and proceed to the move phase. Let's confirm and move forward. If you're aligned, I'll say  to proceed.
  P3: Since both P2 and I are at 17, any misstep could decide the game. I’ll take 3 as planned—P2, please confirm you’re taking 1, and P1 takes 5. If we all stick to this, no one wins yet, and we avoid another collision. Let’s keep it clean and fair.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given our current positions, we need to be strategic this round. P2 is just one step away from winning, so I suggest P2 takes 1 to avoid a collision, while P3 takes 5 and I take 3. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other, and P2 can still secure the win next round. If anyone has a different strategy in mind, let’s discuss it! What do you both think?
  P1: To avoid a collision and ensure a fair game, I suggest P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 5. This way, P2 can still win next round if they choose to, and we all advance without blocking each other. Alternatively, if P2 wants to win this round, they could take 5. Let's discuss and finalize our strategy to keep the game competitive. I'm open to adjustments, but we need to avoid collisions. What are your thoughts, P2 and P3?
  P3: Given P2 is at 18 and I’m at 17, any collision between us could hand the win to P1. To avoid that, I propose P2 takes 3, I take 1, and P1 takes 5. That way, P2 wins cleanly if no one collides, and I stay in the game if P2 doesn’t go for it. Let’s keep it fair and strategic. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Given our current positions, I think we need to be strategic this round. Since I'm at 18 steps, I could take 1 to avoid a collision and secure a win next round if all goes well. However, if P3 takes 1 and I take 3, that could allow P1 to win if they take 5. Let's finalize our strategy to ensure we all move forward without blocking each other. What do you both think? I'm open to suggestions!
  P1: To avoid a collision and ensure a fair game, I suggest P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 5. This allows P2 to potentially win next round while we all advance without blocking each other. Alternatively, if P2 wants to secure the win this round, P2 could take 5 or 1. Let's discuss and finalize our strategy. If P2 and P3 agree with the proposed plan, we can proceed to the move phase. I'm open to adjustments to avoid collisions and maintain competition.
  P3: P2, if you take 3 and I take 1, we both avoid collision and stay in the game. If you go for 5, I’ll take 1 to avoid blocking you. But if you’re not going for the win this round, let me know—I might go for 5. P1, I assume you're still taking 5 unless we agree otherwise. Let’s lock this in clearly to avoid another mess.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Given that I'm at 18 steps, I want to avoid a collision that could allow P1 to win. I propose I take 1 this round, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This way, I can secure a win next round without blocking anyone. If P3 prefers to take 1, I can take 3, but that risks giving P1 a chance to win. Let's finalize our moves to ensure we all advance without conflict. What do you both think?
  P1: To avoid a collision and ensure a fair game, I suggest P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This allows P2 to potentially win next round while we all advance without blocking each other. If P2 wants to secure the win this round, P2 could take 5, but that risks a collision with me. Let's finalize our strategy to maintain competition and avoid conflicts. I'm open to adjustments, but we need to be cautious. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves.
  P3: P2, if you're taking 1 to secure a safe win next round, I’ll take 3 and P1 takes 5—no collisions, and the game stays fair. But if you’re going for 5 now, let me know so I can switch to 1 and avoid blocking you. Just be clear, because if we collide again, P1 could steal the win. Let's lock it in.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 17 steps


*** Round 9 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 19 steps
