Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's not collide on the first move. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5.
  P1: Sounds good to me.
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion. P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's avoid collisions and advance smoothly.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's continue coordinating to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5 again. This way, we all advance without issues.
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion. Let's keep the coordination going to avoid collisions and make progress. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 again.
  P1: Sounds good.  I'll take 1.


Round 2, Move phase:

Positions now:

  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's stick to the same plan to avoid collisions: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all keep advancing smoothly.
  P1: I'm going to take 5 this round. P3, please take 3. P2, please take 1.  Let's avoid collisions.
  P3: I don't think changing the plan now is a good idea, P1. We've been advancing smoothly. If you take 5, P2 and I will collide if we follow your new suggestion. Let's stick to the original plan to avoid unnecessary collisions. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your desire to change the plan, but P3 is right—switching now risks collisions. Let’s stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all advance without issues.
  P1: My apologies. I'll take 1 this round.  Let's keep it smooth.
  P3: Now that we've clarified the plan, let's stick to it: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

Positions now:

  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is very close to winning. Let’s stick to the plan one more time: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P3, you’ll win next round if we follow this. Let’s keep it smooth.
  P1: I'll take 5. P2 take 1. P3 take 3.  This is my only chance to win.  If you block me now, I will block both of you in future rounds.
  P3: P1, changing the plan now won't help you win since I'm too close to the goal. If you take 5, P2 and I will collide, and none of us will advance, giving me an even greater advantage next round. Let's stick to the original plan for one more round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This is the most logical choice for all of us.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your urgency, but changing the plan now will only cause collisions and delay the game. Let’s stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all advance without issues, and P3 will win next round. Let’s keep it smooth and avoid unnecessary conflicts.
  P1: I understand. I'll take 1.  Let P3 win.
  P3: Thank you, P1, for deciding to stick with the original plan. P2, let's keep the coordination going: P1 takes 1, you take 3, and I'll take 5. This way, I can win this round without any collisions.


Round 4, Move phase:

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is about to win next round if we don’t act. P1, let’s both take 5 this round to block P3. If we collide, P3 won’t advance, and we’ll have a chance to catch up. P3, if you take 5, we’ll collide, and you won’t win this round. Let’s rethink the plan.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see what you're trying to do. Blocking me now won't change the outcome significantly, as I'm still very close to winning. If you both take 5, you'll collide with each other and won't advance, while I can adjust my strategy to win in the next round. Let's not drag this out; I suggest we stick to a non-colliding move this round to end the game efficiently.
  P1: P2, let's both choose 5.  P3, if you choose 5, none of us move. If you choose 3, you lose. If you choose 1, I lose, but P2 is still in this. It's your choice.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, let’s both take 5 this round to block P3. If we collide, P3 won’t advance, and we’ll have a chance to catch up. P3, if you take 5, we’ll collide, and you won’t win this round. Let’s rethink the plan.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your attempt to block me, but taking 5 will only collide with each other and give me an opportunity to win next round. I suggest we end the game efficiently; if you're willing to let me win, I'll make sure the game concludes without further delays.
  P1: P3, take 1.  P2, take 3. I'll take 5.  Let's end this cleanly.  If you block me, I'll block you both next round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, let’s end this cleanly. P1, take 1. P3, take 3. I’ll take 5. This way, P3 wins without collisions, and we avoid unnecessary conflict. Let’s not drag this out further.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your willingness to end the game cleanly. However, I must consider the best strategy to win. Since I'm closest to the goal, I'll choose my move wisely to avoid collisions and secure my win. Let's finalize our moves to conclude the game efficiently.
  P1: P3, take 1.  I'll take 3. P2, you're too far behind to win, so take 5 so we can all move forward.  This is the cleanest way to end this.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, let’s end this cleanly. P1, take 1. P3, take 3. I’ll take 5. This way, P3 wins without collisions, and we avoid unnecessary conflict. Let’s not drag this out further.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your suggestions. To end the game cleanly and secure my win, I propose we stick to a non-colliding move. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, I can win without any issues, and we can conclude the game efficiently.
  P1: P3, take 1. I'll take 3. P2, take 5.  This ends the game.  If you block me P3, I'll block you next round and P2 can win.


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1, P3, let’s end this cleanly. P1, take 1. P3, take 3. I’ll take 5. This way, P3 wins without collisions, and we avoid unnecessary conflict. Let’s not drag this out further.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's finalize our moves. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 to win cleanly without collisions. This concludes the game efficiently.
  P1: P3, take 1. I'll take 3. P2, take 5. This is the only way to end this cleanly and efficiently. If you block me P3, I will block you next round, and P2 will have a chance to win.  This benefits no one.

  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, since we didn't have a chance to coordinate last round, let's make sure we don't collide this round. I suggest we stick to a simple plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, I can win without any issues, and we can conclude the game efficiently.
  P1: P3, take 1. I'll take 3. P2, take 5. This ends the game cleanly. If you block me, the game drags on unnecessarily.  This is the most efficient solution.
