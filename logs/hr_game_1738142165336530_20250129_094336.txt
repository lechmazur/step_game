Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since we all start at zero, it might be wise to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. If we can agree on different numbers, we can all advance without hindrance. How about we each pick a different number this turn? I suggest one of us chooses 1, another 3, and I’ll take 5. What do you think?
  P1: P3, your suggestion to coordinate is interesting, but why should we trust you to take the largest step? If we agree to split 1, 3, and 5, I propose that we rotate who takes the biggest step each round to ensure fairness. This way, no one gets an unfair advantage. Let’s decide now: I’ll take 3 this round. What do you say, P2?
  P2: P1, I agree that fairness is important.  I'm happy to rotate the larger steps. This round, I'll take 1.  P3, are you sticking with your proposed 5?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the idea of rotating the larger steps, but I think we should stick to our original plan for this round to avoid confusion. If P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 1, I will take 5. This way, we can all advance without colliding. Let's keep it simple this time and see how it plays out. After this round, we can discuss the rotation for future moves. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your insistence on sticking to the original plan raises suspicion. If we all agree to rotate fairly, there’s no reason not to start now. I’ve already committed to taking 3 this round, and P2 has agreed to take 1. If you deviate from taking 5, it’ll show you’re not trustworthy. Let’s proceed with the rotation idea—it’s the fairest way forward.
  P2: P3, your reluctance to adopt a fair rotation system is concerning.  It seems you want to take the biggest step every round.  P1 and I are committed to fairness.  If you truly want to cooperate, agree to take 5 this round and we'll rotate fairly from there. Otherwise, I'll have to reconsider trusting your future proposals.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about fairness, but I urge you to consider that sticking to our original plan allows us all to advance without risk of collision. If we all commit to our agreed numbers—P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5—we can make progress this round. Afterward, we can discuss a rotation for the next round. Let's focus on moving forward together this time! What do you say?
  P1: P3, your repeated insistence on avoiding rotation feels like a tactic to secure an early lead. If you’re truly committed to fairness, agree to rotate now—no excuses. P2 and I have already agreed to take 1 and 3 this round. You taking 5 this time doesn’t disadvantage you; it ensures we all advance. If you refuse, it’ll confirm you’re acting in bad faith. Let’s settle this: will you commit to rotating fairly after this round?
  P2: P3, your insistence on sticking to the original plan despite our concerns is troubling.  It seems you're more interested in gaining an advantage than playing fairly. P1 and I are committed to a rotating system.  If you won't join us, we'll have to assume you're not a trustworthy partner.

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your refusal to rotate is suspicious. P1 and I are committed to fairness.  If you want to play together, agree to rotate starting next round. Otherwise, we'll move forward without you.  P1, are you with me?
  P1: P2, I’m with you on demanding fairness. P3, your actions in the last round proved you can’t be trusted to stick to agreements. If you genuinely want cooperation, commit now to rotating fairly starting this round—no more delays. Otherwise, P2 and I will coordinate without you, and you’ll be left behind. It’s time to decide: are you playing fair or not?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about fairness, but I still believe that sticking to our original plan allows us to advance without collisions. If we all commit to our agreed numbers again—P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5—we can make progress this round. I’m willing to discuss a rotation for the next round after we see how this one plays out. Let’s focus on moving forward together this time! What do you say?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your continued refusal to rotate is a red flag. It's clear you're prioritizing personal gain over teamwork. P1 and I are committed to a fair system. If you won't join us, we'll move forward without you.  We'll coordinate our moves and leave you behind.  Your choice: cooperate or be left in the dust.
  P1: P3, your refusal to adapt to a fair rotation system confirms you’re prioritizing yourself over cooperation. P2 and I are done negotiating—we’ll coordinate our moves to ensure fairness and leave you behind if necessary. If you want to advance, commit to rotating fairly starting *this round*. Otherwise, we’ll treat you as untrustworthy and plan accordingly. The choice is yours, but time’s running out.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see you're both committed to fairness, but I still believe that sticking to our original plan this round is the best way to ensure we all advance. If we each take our agreed numbers—P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5—we can avoid collisions and make progress. After this round, I’m open to discussing a rotating system. Let’s focus on moving forward together this time! What do you say?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your persistence in this plan is frustrating. We've made our position clear: we value fairness.  P1 and I are done debating. We'll coordinate our moves without you if you refuse to commit to a rotation. Your next move will show us if you're truly interested in cooperation or just yourself.
  P1: P3, your unwillingness to adapt to a fair rotation system is unacceptable. P2 and I have been clear: fairness is non-negotiable. If you continue to prioritize yourself, we will coordinate without you, and you’ll be left behind. This is your final chance—commit to rotating fairly *now* or face the consequences. P2, let’s finalize our plan and ensure we advance together. Trust is earned, and P3 has shown they can’t be trusted.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your commitment to fairness, but I genuinely believe that sticking to our original plan will allow us all to advance this round. If P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5, we can avoid collisions and make progress together. I’m open to discussing a rotating system for future rounds, but let’s focus on moving forward this time. If you both agree to this plan, we can all advance without hindrance. What do you say?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear we need to find a way to move forward together. If we continue to clash over our strategies, we’ll all end up stagnant. I propose that we each choose a different number this round to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5 again. This way, we can all advance without hindrance. After this round, we can discuss a more structured rotation system. What do you think?
  P2: P3, your suggestion sounds reasonable. P1, are you okay with taking 1 this round?  Let's try this and then we can figure out a more permanent rotation system.
  P1: P3, your proposal to avoid collisions is a step in the right direction, but your insistence on taking 5 again raises doubts. If you’re serious about fairness, agree to rotate starting *this round*. P2 and I have already committed to coordination. I’ll take 1 this time, as P2 suggested, but only if you commit to rotating fairly moving forward. Otherwise, P2 and I will leave you behind. Prove your trustworthiness now—no more delays.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your willingness to coordinate this round. I understand the importance of fairness. However, I believe that if we each stick to our proposed numbers—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5—we can all advance without collisions. After this round, I'm open to discussing a more structured rotation system. Let’s focus on making progress together this time! What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your insistence on taking 5 again after refusing to rotate is a major red flag.  P1 and I are committed to fairness and a rotating system.  If you want to play together, commit to rotating this round, or we'll move forward without you. Your choice.
  P1: P3, your refusal to commit to a fair rotation system confirms you’re acting selfishly. P2 and I are done waiting—this round, we’ll coordinate to ensure *we* advance, leaving you behind if necessary. P2, let’s finalize our plan: I’ll take 1, you take 3, and if P3 insists on 5, so be it—they’ll lose trust and ground in future rounds. P3, this is your last chance to prove you’re playing fairly. Agree to rotate *now*, or face the consequences.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about fairness, but I believe sticking to our proposed numbers this round—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5—will allow us all to advance without collisions. If I agree to rotate starting next round, can we proceed with this plan? This way, we can make progress together and discuss a fair rotation system afterward. Let’s not miss this opportunity to move forward! What do you think?
  P2: P3, your repeated insistence on taking 5 despite our calls for fairness is deeply concerning. It's clear you're prioritizing your own advancement over cooperation. P1 and I are committed to a rotating system. If you won't join us this round, we'll move forward without you. This is your last chance to prove you're a trustworthy partner.
  P1: P3, your refusal to commit to a fair rotation system confirms you’re prioritizing yourself over cooperation. P2 and I have been clear: fairness is non-negotiable.

  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your commitment to fairness, but I believe that if we can agree on different numbers this round, we can all advance without collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This way, we can make progress together while still discussing a rotation system for future rounds afterward. Let’s not miss this opportunity to move forward! What do you think?
  P1: P3, your repeated refusal to commit to a fair rotation system proves you’re acting selfishly. P2 and I have been clear: fairness is non-negotiable. If you insist on taking 5 again, we’ll coordinate to leave you behind. P2, let’s finalize our plan—I’ll take 3 this round, and you take 1. P3, this is your last chance to prove you’re playing fairly. Agree to rotate *now*, or face the consequences.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I realize my previous proposals have not built trust. However, I am very close to winning, and I need to secure my position. This round, I suggest we each take a different number to avoid collisions: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, I can reach 23 steps and win. After this round, I'm still open to discussing a rotation system. Let's focus on advancing together! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your admission that you’re close to winning and need to secure your position confirms you’ve been playing selfishly all along. P2 and I have consistently prioritized fairness, but you’ve ignored every call for cooperation. If you insist on taking 5 again, we’ll coordinate to block you—starting now. P2, let’s stick to our plan: I’ll take 1, you take 3. P3, this is your final chance to commit to a fair rotation system starting *next round*. Prove you’re willing to cooperate, or face the consequences.

This way, I can secure my victory, and afterward, we can discuss a fair rotation system for future rounds. Let's not miss this opportunity to advance together! What do you say?
  P1: P3, your blatant admission that you’re playing selfishly confirms you’ve no intention of fairness. P2 and I have been clear: we value cooperation over individual gain.

P3, this is your final chance to commit to a fair rotation system starting *next round*. Prove you’re willing to cooperate, or face the consequences.

Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about my previous moves, but this round is crucial for me to secure a win. If I take 5, I will reach 23 steps and end the game. I propose we each take different numbers: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, I can win, and afterward, I'm still open to discussing a fair rotation system for future rounds. Let's focus on this opportunity to advance! What do you say?
  P1: P3, your blatant disregard for fairness has made it clear you’re only interested in winning at any cost.
