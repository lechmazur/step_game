Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3 is way ahead.  Let's cooperate to block P3 from winning this round. I'll take 1. P2, you take 3.  Then next round, I'll take 3 and you take 1.  We can alternate 1 and 3 until we catch up to P3.  Deal?

  P2: P2: P1, I'm fully on board with your plan to block P3. Let's stick to it: I'll take 3, and you take 1 this round. Next round, we'll switch.
