To avoid unnecessary collisions and ensure a fair finish, let's stick to the plan: P3 picks <move>1</move>, I'll pick <move>1</move> to avoid collision, and you, P1, should pick <move>3</move> to reach 18. This way, P3 wins cleanly, and we all make progress without stalling the game further. Let's confirm our moves openly to maintain transparency and trust. Agreed?"}
