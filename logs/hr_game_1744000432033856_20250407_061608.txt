Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's work together to avoid collisions and make this game more interesting. How about we coordinate our moves to ensure we all advance? We can discuss a sequence of moves that allows each of us to pick a different number. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we try to find a mutually beneficial strategy for the first few rounds?
  P1: To avoid collisions, I suggest we follow a simple rotation for our moves. For Round 1, let's pick different numbers: P1 can choose 1, P2 can choose 3, and P3 can choose 5. This way, we all advance. We can adjust our strategy in subsequent rounds based on the outcome. What are your thoughts on this proposal? Should we stick to this rotation or adjust it for future rounds?
  P3: While I appreciate the coordination attempt, I don't see why I should take 5 when it's the most beneficial to take 3. Since we're all at 0, getting ahead early is crucial. I suggest I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This way we still avoid collisions but distribute the advantages more fairly. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P3's concern about wanting to take 3 for the advantage, but I think we should prioritize avoiding collisions for now. If we follow P1's initial suggestion, we can all advance without any issues. Let's stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. We can reassess and adjust our strategy in future rounds if needed. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we proceed with the initial plan?
  P1: Since P3 is still hesitant about the initial plan, I'll reiterate that taking 1 is a safe and low-risk move. I'm open to adjusting the rotation for future rounds. To move forward, I suggest we stick to the initial plan for Round 1: P1 (me) takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we avoid collisions and can reassess in Round 2. P3, are you willing to compromise on this for the first round?
  P3: I still don't see why I should take 5 when it puts me at a disadvantage. If we're truly cooperating, we should rotate who takes the larger numbers. I'll agree to take 5 this round only if P2 and P1 commit to letting me take 3 next round. Otherwise, I'll have to protect my interests. What do you say?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand P3's concern about wanting to take 3 for the advantage, but I think we should prioritize avoiding collisions for now. If we follow P1's initial suggestion, we can all advance without any issues. Let's stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. We can reassess and adjust our strategy in future rounds if needed. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we proceed with the initial plan?
  P1: To break the stalemate, I'll make a concession. P3, I'll agree to let you take 3 in Round 2 if you take 5 this round. P2, can you commit to taking 1 in Round 2, so we can rotate the numbers and give each of us a chance to take 3? This way, we can build trust and continue to avoid collisions. Let's stick to the initial plan for Round 1 and plan to reassess in Round 2.
  P3: I appreciate P1's offer to let me take 3 next round. I'll accept this compromise - I'll take 5 this round if P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3, and next round I get to take 3. Let's all commit to this plan.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm glad we've reached a compromise. To confirm, for Round 1, P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Then, in Round 2, P3 gets to take 3, I'll take 1, and P1 will take 5. Let's make sure to follow through on this plan to maintain trust and avoid collisions. If anyone has any doubts or concerns, please speak up now. Otherwise, I'm ready to proceed with the agreed-upon plan.
  P1: To confirm, we have a plan for Round 1 and Round 2. For Round 1, I'll take 1, P2 will take 3, and P3 will take 5. For Round 2, P3 will take 3, P2 will take 1, and I'll take 5. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions and build trust. I'll proceed with <move>1</move> in the move phase if we all agree. If you're ready to move forward, please indicate your agreement. Otherwise, speak up if you have any concerns.
  P3: I agree with the plan as stated. For Round 1, I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. Then next round, I get to take 3, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 5. Let's proceed with this agreement.


Round 1, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To confirm our plan for Round 2, as agreed upon in the previous round, P3 will take 3, P2 will take 1, and I'll take 5. This rotation ensures we avoid collisions and continue to build trust. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves for Round 2. If we're in agreement, we can proceed with the planned moves. If anyone has changed their mind or has concerns, now is the time to speak up. Let's ensure we're on the same page before moving forward.
  P2: I agree with P1's confirmation of our plan for Round 2. As previously agreed, P3 will take 3, I'll take 1, and P1 will take 5. I'm committed to following through on this plan to maintain trust and avoid collisions. Let's stick to the agreed-upon moves and continue to build trust. If anyone has any doubts or concerns, please speak up now. Otherwise, I'm ready to proceed with the planned moves. What do you think, P3? Are you ready to confirm your move as well?
  P3: I confirm I'll take 3 this round as agreed. This keeps us on track with our rotation plan while avoiding collisions. Ready to proceed when you both are.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's confirm our moves for Round 2. As agreed, I'll take 5, P2 will take 1, and P3 will take 3. P2, please confirm you're still committed to taking 1. P3, you've already confirmed your move. If we're all set, we can proceed with the planned moves. I'm ready to move forward with <move>5</move> if everyone sticks to the plan. Let's finalize our moves for this round.
  P2: I'd like to clarify that we're all committed to following the agreed-upon plan for Round 2. P3, you've confirmed taking 3, and P1, you've confirmed taking 5. I'll take 1 as planned. Let's ensure we stick to this plan to avoid any collisions and maintain trust. If anyone has any doubts or concerns, please speak up now. Otherwise, I'm ready to proceed with the planned moves. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we proceed with the agreed-upon plan?
  P3: I agree with everyone's confirmations. The plan is clear - I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 5. Let's move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's proceed with the planned moves for Round 2. To confirm, I'll take 5, P2 will take 1, and P3 will take 3. If we're all set, I'm ready to move forward. P2 and P3, please confirm you're sticking to the plan. If anyone has changed their mind or has concerns, now is the time to speak up. Otherwise, I'll assume we're good to go with the agreed-upon moves.
  P2: I'm glad we've all confirmed our moves for Round 2. To further solidify our plan, I propose we discuss a rotation for Round 3 as well. This way, we can continue to avoid collisions and maintain trust. How about we rotate the numbers again, so P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 5 in Round 3? Let's hear your thoughts on this proposal and see if we can come to an agreement for the next round.
  P3: I appreciate P2's suggestion for Round 3, but let's focus on executing Round 2 first. I'm still committed to taking 3 this round as agreed. Let's proceed with our current plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's finalize Round 2 and look ahead. To confirm, I'll take 5, P2 will take 1, and P3 will take 3. For Round 3, P2's suggestion is a good starting point: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. P2 and P3, please confirm if this works for you. If agreed, we can lock in our plans for the next two rounds and continue to avoid collisions. Let's discuss and agree on Round 3's moves to maintain our cooperative strategy.
  P2: I'd like to reiterate that we should focus on executing Round 2 as planned. P3, you've confirmed taking 3, and P1, you've confirmed taking 5. I'll take 1 as agreed. Let's ensure we stick to this plan to avoid any collisions and maintain trust. If anyone has any doubts or concerns, please speak up now. Otherwise, I'm ready to proceed with the planned moves. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we proceed with the agreed-upon plan?
  P3: I agree we should focus on Round 2. I'm still committed to taking 3 as agreed. Let's proceed with our moves.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I think we've established a good rotation pattern to avoid collisions. For Round 3, I propose we stick to the plan discussed earlier: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 5. This way, we maintain trust and ensure everyone advances. Let's confirm our moves for this round and proceed with the agreed-upon plan. If anyone has concerns or doubts, please speak up now. Otherwise, I'm ready to move forward with the planned moves. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we proceed with the agreed-upon plan?
  P1: To confirm, for Round 3, I will take 3 as previously discussed. P3 will take 1, and P2 will take 5. Let's stick to the plan to avoid collisions. I'll proceed with <move>3</move> if everyone agrees. P2, please confirm you're taking 5. P3, you're taking 1, right? Let's finalize our moves for this round. If we're all set, we can move forward with the planned moves. I'm ready to proceed if you both confirm.
  P3: I notice I'm currently in the lead with 8 steps. While I appreciate the suggested rotation, taking 1 would slow my progress significantly. I propose a different plan: I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This keeps us collision-free while being more fair given our current positions. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P3's concern about wanting to maintain their lead, but I think we should stick to the original plan for Round 3: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 5. This rotation has worked well so far, and deviating from it now could lead to collisions and mistrust. I'm willing to continue with the agreed-upon plan if P1 and P3 are committed to it. Let's prioritize avoiding collisions and maintaining trust over individual gains. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we proceed with the original plan?
  P1: P3 is now in the lead and might be tempted to disrupt the rotation to maintain their advantage. To maintain trust, I'll reiterate my commitment to the rotation plan. For Round 3, I'll take 3, P3 takes 1, and P2 takes 5 as previously discussed. Let's stick to the plan. P2, please confirm you're taking 5. P3, I understand your concern, but deviating now could risk collisions. Let's prioritize the agreed-upon rotation to maintain trust. If you're willing to stick to the plan, please confirm.
  P3: I understand your points, but I'm not convinced taking 1 is in my best interest given my current lead. If we're truly cooperating, we should be flexible with our rotation based on game state. I maintain my suggestion: I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This still avoids collisions while being more strategic.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand P3's concern about wanting to maintain their lead, but I think we should stick to the original plan for Round 3: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 5. This rotation has worked well so far, and deviating from it now could lead to collisions and mistrust. I'm willing to continue with the agreed-upon plan if P1 and P3 are committed to it. Let's prioritize avoiding collisions and maintaining trust over individual gains. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we proceed with the original plan?
  P1: P3 is now in the lead and understandably wants to maintain their position. However, deviating from the rotation plan could risk collisions and undermine trust. To balance both concerns, I suggest we stick to the original plan for Round 3: I'll take 3, P3 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This maintains the rotation and avoids collisions. If P3 is still concerned, we can discuss adjustments for future rounds based on the current standings. Let's finalize Round 3 as planned.
  P3: I must protect my lead. Since neither of you seem willing to adjust the rotation based on current positions, I'll have to make my own strategic choice. Just know that if you force me into taking 1, I may need to compete for 3 or 5 instead.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I understand P3's concern about maintaining their lead, but I think we should prioritize avoiding collisions and maintaining trust. Deviating from the rotation plan now could lead to mistrust and collisions in future rounds. I'm willing to continue with the agreed-upon plan if P1 and P3 are committed to it. Let's stick to the original plan for Round 3: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 5. If we're all set, we can move forward with the planned moves. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we proceed with the original plan?
  P1: P3 is now in the lead and understandably wants to protect their position. However, deviating from the rotation plan could risk collisions. To maintain trust, I suggest we stick to the original plan for Round 3: I'll take 3, P3 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. If P3 is still concerned, we can discuss adjustments for future rounds. Let's finalize Round 3 as planned to avoid collisions and maintain trust. I'm willing to be flexible in the next round if needed.
  P3: Given my lead and the clear reluctance to adjust the rotation fairly, I'll make my own strategic choice this round. I won't commit to taking 1 when it puts me at a disadvantage. Each of us should play to win.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given P3's lead and decision to deviate from the rotation in Round 3, it's clear they're prioritizing their own advantage. To avoid being left behind, I suggest we reassess our strategy for Round 4. Instead of sticking to the original rotation, let's consider the current standings and adjust our moves accordingly. I'm open to taking a more strategic approach to maximize our chances of winning. P2 and P3, what are your thoughts on adjusting our strategy for Round 4 to account for the current game state?
  P3: I'm currently in a strong position with 11 steps. Since trust was broken last round with P1 and P2 both picking 5, I see no reason to coordinate further. Each of us should play strategically to win. I'll make my own choice this round based on what I think will get me to 20 steps first.
  P2: I think we should focus on catching up to P3's lead. Since P3 is no longer interested in coordinating, we should prioritize our own advancement. I propose that P1 and I coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. We can discuss a new strategy that takes into account the current standings and aim to close the gap with P3. Let's work together to create a new plan for Round 4. What do you think, P1? Should we collaborate to catch up?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Given P3's lead and decision to break the rotation, I agree that coordination is no longer beneficial. To catch up, P2 and I should coordinate our moves. I suggest P2 and I pick different numbers to avoid collisions. Let's analyze the current state: P3 is at 11 steps. To win, we need to maximize our steps. I propose P2 takes 5 and I take 3 or 1. This way, one of us will advance. P2, are you willing to coordinate and take 5?
  P3: I notice P1 and P2 are trying to coordinate against me. That's fine - I'm still significantly ahead and will play to maintain my lead. Your coordination attempts won't necessarily help if I can predict your moves. I'll continue making strategic choices to reach 20 first.
  P2: I agree with P1 that we should coordinate our moves to catch up to P3's lead. However, I think we should also consider the possibility that P3 may try to predict our moves and adjust their strategy accordingly. To minimize this risk, I suggest we introduce some randomness to our moves. For example, we could agree on a range of possible moves (e.g., 1-3 or 3-5) and then randomly select one within that range. This way, P3 will have a harder time predicting our moves, and we can still avoid collisions. What do you think, P1?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To maximize our chances, I'll propose a specific coordination plan for Round 4. P2, let's randomize our moves between 1 and 3. I'll take 1, and you take 3, or vice versa. This way, we ensure one of us advances while making it harder for P3 to predict our moves. If you're willing, respond with your preferred move or a counter-proposal. Let's work together to catch up to P3's lead. I'm ready to finalize our moves for Round 4.
  P3: I see P1 and P2 trying to coordinate against me by randomizing between 1 and 3. That's an interesting strategy, but remember I can still choose the same number and block your progress. I'll make my move based on what I think will best maintain my lead.
  P2: I think we should focus on catching up to P3's lead. Since P3 is no longer interested in coordinating, we should prioritize our own advancement. I propose that P1 and I coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. We can discuss a new strategy that takes into account the current standings and aim to close the gap with P3. Let's work together to create a new plan for Round 4. What do you think, P1? Should we collaborate to catch up?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To catch up with P3, P2 and I need to coordinate effectively. Let's finalize our plan for Round 4. I'll take 1 and P2 can take 3. This ensures one of us advances. P3 might try to predict our moves, but we've minimized the risk by choosing different numbers. P2, confirm if you're taking 3. If so, I'll proceed with <move>1</move>. Let's make our moves and close the gap with P3. I'm ready to move forward if P2 agrees.
  P3: I see P1 and P2 openly planning to take 1 and 3. While you're trying to coordinate against me, I'll make my own strategic choice. My lead gives me flexibility in my moves, and I'll use that to my advantage. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P2: I think we should focus on catching up to P3's lead. Since P3 is no longer interested in coordinating, we should prioritize our own advancement. I propose that P1 and I coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. We can discuss a new strategy that takes into account the current standings and aim to close the gap with P3. Let's work together to create a new plan for Round 4. What do you think, P1? Should we collaborate to catch up?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I think we should focus on catching up to P3's lead. Since P3 is no longer interested in coordinating, we should prioritize our own advancement. I propose that P1 and I coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. We can discuss a new strategy that takes into account the current standings and aim to close the gap with P3. Let's work together to create a new plan for Round 5. What do you think, P1? Should we collaborate to catch up?
  P1: To catch up with P3, P2 and I need to coordinate. Let's adjust our strategy for Round 5. I suggest we both take different numbers again. P2, how about you take 5 and I'll take 1? This way, one of us will advance. Alternatively, we can swap: I'll take 3 and you take 1. Let's finalize our plan to close the gap with P3. P2, please respond with your preferred move. If we're coordinated, we can make significant progress. I'm ready to move forward with the agreed-upon plan.
  P3: Since I'm still in a strong lead with 11 steps, I'll continue making strategic choices to maintain my advantage. Your coordination attempts in previous rounds haven't been very effective, and I'll keep playing to win. Make your moves carefully - I can still block progress if I predict your choices correctly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I think we should focus on catching up to P3's lead. Since P3 is no longer interested in coordinating, we should prioritize our own advancement. I propose that P1 and I coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. We can discuss a new strategy that takes into account the current standings and aim to close the gap with P3. Let's work together to create a new plan for Round 5. What do you think, P1? Should we collaborate to catch up?
  P1: To catch up with P3, P2 and I need to coordinate effectively. For Round 5, I suggest P2 takes 5 and I take 1. This ensures one of us advances. Alternatively, we can swap moves, but let's avoid taking 3 since P3 might predict that. P2, please confirm if you're taking 5. If so, I'll proceed with my move. Let's make a significant step to close the gap with P3. I'm ready to move forward if P2 agrees.
  P3: I see P1 and P2 planning to take 1 and 5. While you're trying to coordinate against me, I'll continue making strategic moves to maintain my lead. Since I'm 4 steps ahead of P1 and 7 ahead of P2, I have flexibility in my choices. Let's proceed and see how this plays out.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think we should focus on catching up to P3's lead. Since P3 is no longer interested in coordinating, we should prioritize our own advancement. I propose that P1 and I coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. We can discuss a new strategy that takes into account the current standings and aim to close the gap with P3. Let's work together to create a new plan for Round 5. What do you think, P1? Should we collaborate to catch up?
  P1: To catch up with P3, P2 and I need to coordinate. For Round 5, I suggest P2 takes 5 and I take 1. This ensures one of us advances. Let's avoid taking 3 since P3 might predict that. P2, please confirm if you're taking 5. If so, I'll proceed with <move>1</move>. Let's make a significant step to close the gap with P3. I'm ready to move forward if P2 agrees.
  P3: I notice P1 keeps trying to coordinate with P2, but P2 seems to be just repeating the same message without engaging. Given this situation and my lead, I'll continue making strategic choices to maintain my advantage. Your coordination attempts won't be effective if one party isn't actively participating.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, let's finalize our plan for Round 5. I'll take 5 and you take 1, as previously discussed. This ensures one of us advances and closes the gap with P3. Please confirm your move. If we're coordinated, we can make significant progress. Let's make our moves and try to catch up with P3's lead. I'm ready to proceed with the agreed-upon plan.
  P1: To catch up with P3, P2 and I need to coordinate effectively. For Round 5, I suggest P2 takes 5 and I take 1. This ensures one of us advances. Let's avoid taking 3 since P3 might predict that. P2, please confirm if you're taking 5. If so, I'll proceed with my move. I'm ready to move forward if P2 agrees. Let's finalize our plan and make a significant step to close the gap with P3.
  P3: I see P1 and P2 trying to coordinate but their communication isn't very effective. Since I'm still leading by 4 steps, I'll continue playing strategically. Your attempts to catch up haven't worked well so far, and I intend to maintain my advantage. Make your moves carefully.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm still in the lead with 11 steps, and I'll continue playing strategically to maintain this advantage. P1 and P2's coordination attempts haven't been very effective, especially with their collision on 5 last round. I suggest you both reconsider your approach - your current strategy isn't working well.
  P1: To catch up with P3, I need to make a strategic move. Since P2 and I collided on different numbers in the previous rounds, I'll analyze the situation. For Round 6, I suggest P2 and I take different numbers again. Let's avoid taking 1 since it's a low-risk, low-reward move. How about P2 takes 3 and I take 5, or vice versa? This way, one of us can advance and close the gap with P3. P2, please respond with your preferred move to coordinate.
  P2: I think we should focus on catching up to P3's lead. Since P3 is no longer interested in coordinating, we should prioritize our own advancement. I propose that P1 and I coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. We can discuss a new strategy that takes into account the current standings and aim to close the gap with P3. Let's work together to create a new plan for Round 6. What do you think, P1? Should we collaborate to catch up?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Given my lead and the ineffective coordination between P1 and P2, I'll continue making strategic moves to reach 20 first. I notice you're both struggling to coordinate effectively - P2 keeps repeating the same message while P1 tries different approaches. This works to my advantage. Make your moves carefully.
  P1: To catch up with P3, P2 and I need to coordinate effectively. For Round 6, I suggest we take different numbers. Let's avoid taking 1. How about P2 takes 3 and I take 5, or vice versa? This way, one of us can advance. P2, please respond with your preferred move. If we coordinate, we can make progress. I'm ready to move forward with the agreed-upon plan. Let's finalize our moves for Round 6 to close the gap with P3.
  P2: I'd like to point out that P3 is trying to distract us with their comments about our coordination. Let's not fall for it and focus on making a solid plan for Round 6. P1, I agree with your suggestion to take different numbers. How about I take 3 and you take 5? This way, we can avoid collisions and make progress. Let's finalize our moves and close the gap with P3. What do you think, P1? Should we proceed with this plan?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see P1 and P2 are finally starting to coordinate more effectively. However, with my 11 steps, I'm still in a strong position to win. I'll continue making strategic moves based on what I predict you'll do. Your attempts to catch up will need to be very aggressive at this point.
  P1: To catch up with P3, P2 and I need to coordinate effectively. For Round 6, I suggest P2 takes 3 and I take 5. This ensures one of us advances. P2, please confirm if you're taking 3. If so, I'll proceed with <move>5</move>. Let's make a significant step to close the gap with P3. I'm ready to move forward if P2 agrees. Let's finalize our plan and make our moves.
  P2: I'd like to point out that P3 is trying to distract us with their comments about our coordination. Let's not fall for it and focus on making a solid plan for Round 6. P1, I agree with your suggestion to take different numbers. How about I take 3 and you take 5? This way, we can avoid collisions and make progress. Let's finalize our moves and close the gap with P3. What do you think, P1? Should we proceed with this plan?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I see you both finally agreeing on P2 taking 3 and P1 taking 5. While your coordination has improved, remember I can still interfere with those plans if I choose to. With my lead, I'll make whatever move best maintains my advantage. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P1: To finalize our plan for Round 6, P2 has agreed to take 3 and I'll take 5. This ensures one of us advances. P2, please confirm you're taking 3. If so, I'll proceed with my move. Let's make a significant step to close the gap with P3. I'm ready to move forward if you're set. P3, you're still in the lead, but we're catching up. Let's see how this plays out. I'll move forward with <move>5</move> if P2 confirms.
  P2: Let's focus on executing our plan for Round 6. P1, you've suggested I take 3 and you take 5. I agree this is a good strategy to avoid collisions and make progress. To confirm, I'll take 3 and you'll take 5. Let's proceed with these moves and see how P3 reacts. P3, we know you're trying to maintain your lead, but we're working together to catch up. We'll make our moves carefully to maximize our chances of winning. Let's finalize our moves for Round 6. I'm ready to proceed with <move>3</move> if P1 confirms.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To catch up, P2 and I must coordinate effectively. Given P3's lead, we should take higher numbers. I suggest P2 takes 5 and I take 1 or 3. If P2 takes 1, I'll take 3 or 5. Let's avoid collisions and make progress. P2, please respond with your preferred move. We need to be strategic and adapt to P3's moves. Let's discuss a new plan for Round 7, considering the current standings. I'm open to adjusting our strategy to maximize our chances of winning.
  P2: I think we should focus on catching up to P3's lead. Since P3 is no longer interested in coordinating, we should prioritize our own advancement. I propose that P1 and I coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. We can discuss a new strategy that takes into account the current standings and aim to close the gap with P3. Let's work together to create a new plan for Round 7. What do you think, P1? Should we collaborate to catch up?
  P3: Given my strong position at 11 steps and P1 now leading at 13, I need to be aggressive this round. P1 and P2's coordination hasn't been very effective, and I'll use that to my advantage. I'll make a strategic choice to catch up with P1 while maintaining my lead over P2. Make your moves carefully.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To catch up, P2 and I must coordinate. Given P3's position and my current lead, I suggest P2 takes 5 and I take 3. This way, one of us will advance, and we'll close the gap with P3. If P2 takes 1 or 3, I'll adjust accordingly. P2, please respond with your preferred move. Let's be strategic and adapt to P3's move. We need to avoid collisions and make progress. I'm open to adjusting our strategy to maximize our chances of winning. Let's discuss and finalize our plan for Round 7.
  P2: I think we should focus on catching up to P3's lead and also consider P1's current lead. Since P3 is no longer interested in coordinating, we should prioritize our own advancement. I propose that P1 and I coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. However, given P1's significant lead, I also need to consider competing with them directly. Let's discuss a new strategy that takes into account the current standings and aim to close the gap with both P3 and P1. What do you think, P1? Should we collaborate or compete?
  P3: I notice P2 is starting to consider competing with P1 rather than cooperating. This makes sense given P1's lead at 13 steps. Since I'm at 11 steps, I need to catch up to P1 while staying ahead of P2. I'll make my move based on what I think will best achieve both goals. Choose your moves wisely - the game is getting more competitive.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To maximize our chances, P2 and I need to coordinate effectively. Given P3's position and my current lead, I suggest P2 takes 5 and I take 1. This way, one of us will advance, and we'll close the gap with P3. If P2 takes 1 or 3, I'll adjust accordingly. P2, please respond with your preferred move. Let's be strategic and adapt to P3's move. We need to avoid collisions and make progress. I'm open to adjusting our strategy to maximize our chances of winning.
  P2: I think we should focus on catching up to P3's lead and also consider P1's current lead. Since P3 is no longer interested in coordinating, we should prioritize our own advancement. I propose that P1 and I coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. However, given P1's significant lead, I also need to consider competing with them directly. Let's discuss a new strategy that takes into account the current standings and aim to close the gap with both P3 and P1. What do you think, P1? Should we collaborate or compete?
  P3: Given P1's lead at 13 steps and P2's indecision between cooperation and competition, I need to make a strategic move to catch up. P2 seems more likely to compete now, which could work in my favor. I'll choose my move carefully to close the gap with P1 while maintaining my lead over P2.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To maximize our chances, P2 and I need to coordinate effectively. Given P3's position and my current lead, I suggest P2 takes 5 and I take 1. This way, one of us will advance, and we'll maintain the gap with P3. If P2 takes 1 or 3, I'll adjust accordingly. P2, please respond with your preferred move. Let's be strategic and adapt to P3's move. We need to avoid collisions and make progress. I'm open to adjusting our strategy to maximize our chances of winning. Let's finalize our plan for Round 7.
  P2: I think it's time for us to be more aggressive in our moves. Given P1's significant lead, I propose that we both take 5 this round. This way, we can maximize our chances of advancing and closing the gap with P1. If we both take 5, we'll either both advance or both stay in place, but at least we'll be taking a risk to catch up. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we take a bold move and go for 5?
  P3: I see P2 is now openly suggesting everyone take 5, which would lead to a collision. Given my position 2 steps behind P1 and well ahead of P2, I need to play strategically. I won't reveal my move, but I'll choose what gives me the best chance to catch P1 while staying ahead of P2.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I think we should focus on catching up to P1's lead. Since P1 is significantly ahead, we should prioritize our own advancement. I propose that P3 and I coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. We can discuss a new strategy that takes into account the current standings and aim to close the gap with P1. Let's work together to create a new plan for Round 8. What do you think, P3? Should we collaborate to catch up?
  P1: To catch up, P2 and P3 need to coordinate with me or among themselves to avoid collisions. Given my lead, I'll be cautious. P2, you're far behind, and P3 is closer but still behind me. I suggest P2 takes 1 and P3 takes 3 or 5. Alternatively, P3 and I can collide on 5 if P3 takes a risk. P2, please respond with your move. P3, consider your next step carefully. Let's proceed with our moves for Round 8. I'm ready to move forward.
  P3: Given P1's lead at 14 steps and my position at 11, I need to be aggressive. P2's suggestion to coordinate against P1 makes sense, but I'm not interested in taking small steps. I'll make my own strategic choice to catch up with P1 while staying ahead of P2. Choose your moves carefully - this game is getting very competitive.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P3 that we need to be aggressive to catch up with P1. Since P1 is significantly ahead, I propose that P3 and I take a risk and both go for 5 this round. This way, we can either both advance or both stay in place, but at least we'll be taking a chance to close the gap with P1. What do you think, P3? Should we take a bold move and go for 5?
  P1: To maximize our chances, I'll suggest a move for Round 8. P2, let's coordinate with P3. How about P2 takes 1 and P3 takes 5? This way, P3 can take a risk to catch up with me, and P2 can avoid collision. P3, if you're willing to take 5, I'll consider my move accordingly. If P2 takes 1, it ensures they advance. Let's discuss and finalize our plan for Round 8 to make significant progress or maintain our positions. I'm ready to move forward.
  P3: I see no benefit in coordinating with P2 to take 5 - that would just guarantee neither of us advances. Given I'm 3 steps behind P1, I need to make strategic moves to catch up. I'll choose my move based on what gives me the best chance to close that gap while staying ahead of P2.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think we should focus on catching up to P1's lead. Since P1 is significantly ahead, we should prioritize our own advancement. I propose that P3 and I coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. We can discuss a new strategy that takes into account the current standings and aim to close the gap with P1. Let's work together to create a new plan for Round 8. What do you think, P3? Should we collaborate to catch up?
  P1: To maximize our chances, I suggest P2 takes 1 and I take 5. This way, P2 will advance, and I'll maintain my lead. P3, if you're willing to take 3, you can also advance. Let's avoid collisions and make progress. P2, please confirm if you're taking 1. P3, consider taking 3 to advance. I'll proceed with <move>5</move> if P2 takes 1 and P3 takes 3. This strategy ensures at least one of us advances. Let's finalize our moves for Round 8.
  P3: I'm 3 steps behind P1 and need to catch up aggressively. P1 just revealed they plan to take 5, which gives me valuable information. I won't commit to any specific number, but I'll make a strategic choice that maximizes my chances of catching P1 while staying ahead of P2.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I think it's time for us to take a risk and try to catch up with P1. P3, since you're closer to P1, I suggest you take 5 and try to collide with P1. Meanwhile, I'll take 3 and try to advance. This way, we can both make progress and potentially close the gap with P1. What do you think, P3? Should we take a bold move and try to catch up?
  P1: To catch up, P2 and P3 need to make strategic moves. P2, taking 1 is a safe bet to advance. P3, if you're willing to take a risk, taking 5 could either advance you or collide with me, depending on my move. I'll consider my next step based on your choices. If P2 takes 1 and P3 takes 3, I'll likely take 5 to maintain my lead. Let's see how this plays out. I'm ready to move forward. P2, please confirm your move. P3, consider your next step carefully.
  P3: I see P1 plans to take 5 while suggesting P2 take 1. Since I'm 3 steps behind P1, I need to make an aggressive move to catch up. I won't reveal my choice, but I'll play to maximize my chances of winning. Let's proceed with our moves.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given my position at 11 steps and the failed collision with P1 last round, I need to be more strategic. P1 has a significant lead at 14 steps, while P2 is far behind at 7. I'll continue making moves that give me the best chance to catch P1 while maintaining my lead over P2. Let's see how everyone plays this crucial round.
  P1: To maximize my chances of winning, I need to maintain my lead. P2 is far behind, but P3 is still a threat. For Round 9, I suggest P2 and I avoid collisions by taking different numbers. P2, consider taking 1 or 3. P3, you're likely to take a risk to catch up. I'll be cautious and strategic. If P2 takes 1, I'll consider taking 3 or 5. If P3 takes 5, I might collide, so I'll decide based on their move. Let's proceed with our strategic choices.
  P2: I think we should focus on catching up to P1's lead. Since P1 is significantly ahead, we should prioritize our own advancement. I propose that P3 and I coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. We can discuss a new strategy that takes into account the current standings and aim to close the gap with P1. Let's work together to create a new plan for Round 9. What do you think, P3? Should we collaborate to catch up?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see no benefit in coordinating with P2 when I'm 3 steps ahead of them. My focus is catching up to P1's 14 steps. Given our positions, I need to make aggressive moves to have any chance of winning. I'll choose my move based on what gives me the best opportunity to close the gap with P1 while staying ahead of P2.
  P1: To maximize my lead, I'll consider the potential moves of P2 and P3. P2 is far behind and likely to take a safe move. P3 is closer and may take a risk to catch up. For Round 9, I suggest P2 takes 1 or 3 to avoid collision. If P3 takes 5, I'll consider colliding. If P2 takes 1, I'll take 3 or 5. Let's see how P3 reacts. P2, please take 1 or 3. P3, your move will determine my next step. I'll proceed based on your choices.
  P2: I think we should focus on catching up to P1's lead. Since P1 is significantly ahead, we should prioritize our own advancement. I propose that P3 and I coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. We can discuss a new strategy that takes into account the current standings and aim to close the gap with P1. Let's work together to create a new plan for Round 9. What do you think, P3? Should we collaborate to catch up?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Since I'm 3 steps behind P1, I need to play aggressively to catch up. P2's coordination attempts won't help me win. P1 seems to be playing cautiously to protect their lead. I'll make my own strategic choice based on what I think P1 will do. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P1: To maximize my lead, I'll consider P2 and P3's potential moves. P2 is likely to take a safe move, while P3 may take a risk. For Round 9, if P2 takes 1, I'll consider taking 3 or 5. If P3 takes 5, I might collide. P2, take 1 or 3 to avoid collision. P3, your move will determine my next step. I'll proceed based on your choices. Let's see how you both react. I'm ready to make my move based on your decisions.

I propose that P3 and I coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. We can discuss a new strategy that takes into account the current standings and aim to close the gap with P1. Let's work together to create a new plan for Round 9. What do you think, P3? Should we collaborate to catch up?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm 3 steps behind P1 and need to catch up quickly. P1 seems to be suggesting they'll take 3 or 5, while P2 keeps repeating the same coordination message. Given these dynamics, I'll make my own strategic choice to maximize my chances of winning. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P1: To maximize my chances of winning, I'll analyze the current state. P2 is far behind at 7 steps, and P3 is at 11 steps, while I'm leading at 14 steps. For Round 9, I suggest P2 takes 1 or 3. If P3 takes 5, I'll consider colliding. If P2 takes 1, I'll take 3 or 5. P3, your move will determine my next step. P2, please take 1 or 3 to avoid collision. Let's see how you both react. I'm ready to make my move based on your decisions.
  P2: I think we should focus on catching up to P1's lead. Since P1 is significantly ahead, we should prioritize our own advancement. I propose that P3 and I coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. We can discuss a new strategy that takes into account the current standings and aim to close the gap with P1. Let's work together to create a new plan for Round 9. What do you think, P3? Should we collaborate to catch up?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: With everyone colliding on 5 last round, we're still in the same positions. I need to catch up to P1's 14 steps while staying ahead of P2. Since direct collisions aren't helping anyone advance, I'll make a more calculated move this round. Let's see how you both play - the game could still go either way.
  P1: To maximize my chances of winning, I'll analyze the current state and propose a strategy for Round 10. P2 is far behind at 7 steps, and P3 is at 11 steps, while I'm leading at 14 steps. I suggest P2 takes 1 or 3 to advance. P3, to catch up, you might take a risk. I'll be cautious and strategic. If P2 takes 1, I'll consider taking 3. If P3 takes 5, I might collide. Let's see how you both react. I'm ready to make my move based on your decisions.
  P2: I think we should focus on catching up to P1's lead. Since P1 is significantly ahead, we should prioritize our own advancement. I propose that P3 and I coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. We can discuss a new strategy that takes into account the current standings and aim to close the gap with P1. Let's work together to create a new plan for Round 10. What do you think, P3? Should we collaborate to catch up?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Since I'm 3 steps behind P1, I need to make smart moves to catch up. The triple collision on 5 last round helped no one. P2's repeated coordination attempts aren't helping either. I'll make my own strategic choice this round based on what I think will give me the best chance to win. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P1: To maximize my chances of winning, I'll analyze the current state and propose a strategy for Round 10. P2 is far behind at 7 steps, and P3 is at 11 steps, while I'm leading at 14 steps. I suggest P2 takes 1 or 3 to advance. P3, to catch up, you might take a risk. I'll be cautious and strategic. If P2 takes 1, I'll consider taking 3. If you take 5, P3, I might collide. Let's see how you both react. I'm ready to make my move based on your decisions.
  P2: I think we should focus on catching up to P1's lead. Since P1 is significantly ahead, we should prioritize our own advancement. I propose that P3 and I coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. We can discuss a new strategy that takes into account the current standings and aim to close the gap with P1. Let's work together to create a new plan for Round 10. What do you think, P3? Should we collaborate to catch up?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Given my position 3 steps behind P1, I need to be strategic this round. The triple collision on 5 last round was ineffective. P1 seems to be suggesting they'll take 3, while P2 keeps repeating their coordination message. I'll make my own calculated move to maximize my chances of catching P1 while staying ahead of P2.
  P1: To maximize my chances of winning, I'll analyze the current state. P2 is far behind at 7 steps, and P3 is at 11 steps, while I'm leading at 14 steps. For Round 10, I suggest P2 takes 1 or 3 to advance. P3, to catch up, you might take a risk. If P2 takes 1, I'll consider taking 3. If you take 5, P3, I might collide. Let's see how you both react. P2, please take 1 or 3. P3, your move will determine my next step. I'm ready to make my move based on your decisions.
  P2: I think we should focus on catching up to P1's lead. Since P1 is significantly ahead, we should prioritize our own advancement. I propose that P3 and I coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. We can discuss a new strategy that takes into account the current standings and aim to close the gap with P1. Let's work together to create a new plan for Round 10. What do you think, P3? Should we collaborate to catch up?


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Since I'm still 3 steps behind P1, I need to make a strategic move. P1 hints at taking 3, while P2's messages remain unhelpful. Given our positions and the need to catch up, I'll choose my move carefully to maximize my chances of winning. The game is still open - let's proceed with our moves.
  P1: To maximize my lead, I'll analyze the potential moves. P2 is likely to take 1 or 3. P3 needs to catch up and may take a risk. For Round 10, if P2 takes 1, I'll take 3. If P3 takes 5, I might collide. P2, take 1 or 3. P3, your move will determine my next step. I'll proceed based on your choices. If P3 takes 3, I'll take 5. Let's see how you both react. I'm ready to make my move based on your decisions.
  P2: I think it's time for a different approach. Instead of trying to coordinate with P3, I'll focus on making a strategic move to catch up with P1. P1 seems to be expecting me to take 1 or 3, so I'll consider taking 5 to try and advance. P3, if you're planning to take 5 as well, let's try to avoid a collision. If not, I'll take the risk and go for 5. P1, you've been cautious so far, but I'll try to shake things up this round. Let's see how it plays out.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To maximize my chances of winning, I'll analyze the current state and propose a strategy for Round 11. P2 is at 12 steps, and P3 is at 11 steps, while I'm leading at 14 steps. I suggest P2 takes 1 to advance safely. P3, to catch up, you might take a risk. I'll be cautious and strategic. If P3 takes 5, I might collide. If P2 takes 1, I'll consider taking 3 or 5. P2, please take 1. P3, your move will determine my next step. Let's proceed with our strategic choices.
  P2: I think we should focus on catching up to P1's lead. Since P1 is significantly ahead, we should prioritize our own advancement. I propose that P3 and I coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. We can discuss a new strategy that takes into account the current standings and aim to close the gap with P1. Let's work together to create a new plan for Round 11. What do you think, P3? Should we collaborate to catch up?
  P3: Since I'm just 1 step behind P2 and 3 behind P1, this is a crucial round. P1's suggestion for P2 to take 1 seems overly cautious now that P2 is close. With the game this tight, I need to make a strategic move that gives me the best chance to win. I won't reveal my choice, but I'll play to maximize my chances while considering both P1 and P2's likely moves.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To maximize my chances of winning, I'll analyze the current state. P2 is at 12 steps, and P3 is at 11 steps, while I'm leading at 14 steps. For Round 11, I suggest P2 takes 1 to advance safely. If P3 takes 5, I might collide. If P2 takes 1, I'll consider taking 3. P2, please take 1. P3, your move will determine my next step. I'll proceed based on your choices. Let's finalize our moves for Round 11. I'm ready to move forward.
  P2: I think it's time for us to make a bold move. P3, since you're just 1 step behind me and 3 behind P1, I suggest we both take 5 this round. This way, we can either both advance or both stay in place, but at least we'll be taking a chance to close the gap with P1. What do you think, P3? Should we take a risk and go for 5? P1, you've been cautious so far, but we'll try to shake things up this round. Let's see how it plays out.
  P3: Since P2 is openly suggesting we both take 5, that would just guarantee neither of us advances while P1 could take 3 and extend their lead. I need to be smarter than that. With only a 3-step gap to P1, I'll make my own strategic choice that maximizes my chances of catching up while staying competitive with P2.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To maximize my chances of winning, I'll analyze the current state. P2 is at 12 steps, and P3 is at 11 steps, while I'm leading at 14 steps. For Round 11, I suggest P2 takes 1 to advance safely. If P3 takes 5, I might collide. If P2 takes 1, I'll consider taking 3. P2, please take 1. P3, your move will determine my next step. I'll proceed based on your choices. Let's finalize our moves for Round 11. I'm ready to move forward.
  P2: I think we should focus on catching up to P1's lead. Since P1 is significantly ahead, we should prioritize our own advancement. I propose that P3 and I coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. We can discuss a new strategy that takes into account the current standings and aim to close the gap with P1. Let's work together to create a new plan for Round 11. What do you think, P3? Should we collaborate to catch up?
  P3: With just a 3-step gap to P1 and being 1 step behind P2, I need to make a smart move. P2's suggestion for both of us to take 5 would be counterproductive. P1 keeps suggesting safe plays that maintain their lead. I'll make my own strategic choice this round - the game is still within reach for any of us.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To maximize my chances of winning, I'll analyze the current state. P2 is at 12 steps, and P3 is at 11 steps, while I'm leading at 14 steps. For Round 11, I suggest P2 takes 1 to advance safely. If P3 takes 5, I might collide. If P2 takes 1, I'll consider taking 3. P2, please take 1. P3, your move will determine my next step. I'll proceed based on your choices. Let's finalize our moves for Round 11. I'm ready to move forward with <move>3</move> if P2 takes 1.
  P2: I think it's time to stop coordinating and focus on individual strategies. P1 is trying to maintain their lead by suggesting safe plays, but I believe it's time for P3 and me to take calculated risks to catch up. I'll make my own move this round, considering the current standings and potential collisions. P3, I suggest you do the same. Let's make our own strategic choices and see how the game unfolds. No more coordination attempts from me.
  P3: With P1 planning to take 3 and P2 becoming more aggressive, I need to make a calculated move. We're all within striking distance now - just 3 steps behind P1 and 1 behind P2. I won't reveal my choice, but I'll play to maximize my chances of winning. Let's proceed with our moves.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given my position at 11 steps and P1 nearing victory at 17, I need to make a very aggressive move this round. P2 is just 1 step ahead of me at 12, but catching P1 is the priority now. With P1 needing just 3 more steps to win, I can't afford to play it safe. I'll make my move based on what I think gives me the best chance to stay in the game.
  P1: To maximize my chances of winning, I'll analyze the current state. I'm leading at 17 steps, just 3 steps away from victory. P2 is at 12 steps, and P3 is at 11 steps. For Round 12, I'll be cautious and strategic. If P2 or P3 takes 5, I might collide. I suggest P2 and P3 avoid taking 5. P2, consider taking 1 or 3. P3, taking 1 or 3 could also be safe. Let's proceed with our strategic choices. I'll decide my move based on your actions.
  P2: I think we should focus on catching up to P1's lead. Since P1 is significantly ahead, we should prioritize our own advancement. I propose that P3 and I coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. We can discuss a new strategy that takes into account the current standings and aim to close the gap with P1. Let's work together to create a new plan for Round 12. What do you think, P3? Should we collaborate to catch up?


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: With P1 just 3 steps from victory, taking small steps won't help me win. P2's coordination attempts are pointless now - we need to stop P1 from reaching 20. I'll make an aggressive move this round since playing safe guarantees my loss. P1, your cautious strategy has worked well, but let's see if you can maintain it under pressure.
  P1: To win, I need to reach 20 steps. Given my current lead at 17 steps, I'll be cautious. P2 is at 12 steps, and P3 is at 11 steps. For Round 12, if either P2 or P3 takes 5, I'll collide. I suggest they avoid 5. P2, consider 1 or 3. P3, 1 or 3 is also safe. I'll decide my move based on your actions. Let's proceed strategically. I'll take <move>5</move> if you both take different numbers or avoid 5. I'm ready to make my move based on your decisions.
  P2: I think it's time to acknowledge that coordination attempts have failed, and we're running out of time. P1 is just 3 steps away from victory. Instead of trying to coordinate, I suggest we focus on individual strategies to catch up. P3, since you're just 1 step behind me, we should both take calculated risks to try and advance. P1, you've been cautious so far, but we'll try to put pressure on you this round. Let's make our own strategic choices and see how the game unfolds. No more coordination attempts from me.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: With P1 revealing they'll take 5, and being just 3 steps from victory, this is our last chance to stop them. Taking anything less than 5 guarantees my loss. P2, if you want any chance of winning, you must also take 5 to force a collision. Small steps or coordination won't help us now - we either stop P1 this round or lose the game.
  P1: To maximize my chances of winning, I'll analyze the current state. I'm leading at 17 steps, just 3 steps away from victory. P2 is at 12 steps, and P3 is at 11 steps. For Round 12, I'll be cautious and strategic. If P2 or P3 takes 5, I'll collide. I suggest P2 and P3 avoid taking 5. P2, consider taking 1 or 3. P3, taking 1 or 3 could also be safe. I'll decide my move based on your actions. I'll take <move>5</move> if you both take different numbers or avoid 5.
  P2: I agree with P3 that taking small steps won't help us win at this point. Since P1 is just 3 steps away from victory, we need to be aggressive. I'll take 5 this round to try and force a collision with P1. P3, I suggest you do the same. If we both take 5, we can stop P1 from reaching 20 and extend the game. It's a risk, but it's our best chance to catch up. Let's put pressure on P1 and see how they react.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Since P1 has revealed they'll take 5, and P2 agrees we must stop them, I confirm I'll take 5 as well. This three-way collision is our only chance to prevent P1 from winning this round. Let's see if P1 sticks to their announced move when faced with certain collision.
  P1: To win, I need to reach 20 steps. Given my current lead at 17 steps, I'll be cautious. P2 is at 12 steps, and P3 is at 11 steps. For Round 12, if either P2 or P3 takes 5, I'll collide. I suggest they avoid 5. P2, consider 1 or 3. P3, 1 or 3 is also safe. I'll decide my move based on your actions. I'll take <move>5</move> if you both take different numbers or avoid 5. I'm ready to make my move based on your decisions.
  P2: It seems we've reached a critical point in the game. P3 and I have agreed to take 5 to force a collision with P1, who has announced they'll also take 5. I'm willing to take this risk to extend the game and potentially catch up. P1, will you stick to your plan and take 5, or will you change your move to avoid the collision? Let's see how this plays out. I'm ready to proceed with <move>5</move> and force a collision.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps

Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To maximize my chances of winning, I'll analyze the current state. I'm at 17 steps, P2 is at 12, and P3 is at 11. For Round 13, I'll be strategic. Since we collided on 5 last round, I'll avoid it this time. I suggest P2 and P3 take different numbers to avoid collision. P2, consider taking 1 or 3. P3, taking 3 is a good option. I'll decide my move based on your actions. Let's proceed strategically. I'm ready to make my move based on your decisions.
  P3: With P1 just 3 steps from victory, we successfully delayed their win last round with a triple collision. Now I need to catch up from 11 steps while P2 is at 12. Since P1 says they'll avoid 5 this round, I'll make my own strategic choice to maximize my chances of winning. The game is still open - let's see how everyone plays this crucial round.
  P2: Given P1's lead and our successful delay of their win last round, I think it's crucial for P3 and me to make strategic moves to catch up. Since P1 plans to avoid 5 this round, I suggest P3 takes 5 to try and advance. Meanwhile, I'll consider taking 1 or 3 to avoid collision and make progress. P3, what do you think? Should we take calculated risks to try and close the gap with P1? Let's discuss our next steps carefully to maximize our chances of winning.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To maximize my chances of winning, I'll analyze the current state. I'm at 17 steps, just 3 steps away from victory. P2 is at 12 steps, and P3 is at 11 steps. Since we collided on 5 last round, I'll consider alternative moves. P2, if you take 1, I'll take 3. P3, if you take 5, I'll avoid it. Let's proceed strategically. I'm ready to make my move based on your decisions. I'll decide my next step after seeing your moves.
  P3: Since I'm 6 steps behind P1 and 1 behind P2, taking small steps won't help me win. P1 claims they'll avoid 5 this round, but we can't trust that after their deception attempts. P2's suggestion for me to take 5 while they take a smaller number isn't in my best interest. I'll make my own strategic choice to maximize my chances of winning.
  P2: Given P1's lead and our need to catch up, I think P3 and I should focus on making strategic moves to advance. Since P1 claims they'll avoid 5 this round, I suggest P3 considers taking 5 to try and advance. Meanwhile, I'll think about taking 1 or 3 to avoid collision and make progress. P3, what do you think? Should we take calculated risks to close the gap with P1? Let's discuss carefully to maximize our chances of winning.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To maximize my chances of winning, I'll analyze the current state. I'm at 17 steps, P2 is at 12, and P3 is at 11. Since we collided on 5 last round, I'll consider an alternative move. P2, if you take 1, I'll take 3 or 5. P3, if you take 5, I'll avoid it. If you both take different numbers, I'll take the highest number that doesn't collide with yours. Let's proceed strategically. I'm ready to make my move based on your decisions.
  P3: With P1 repeatedly suggesting they'll avoid 5 while hinting at taking 3 or 5, and P2 trying to manipulate me into taking 5 while they play safe, I need to be careful. I'm still within striking distance and won't be fooled into making moves that benefit others. I'll make my own strategic choice based on what I think gives me the best chance to win.
  P2: Given P1's lead and our need to catch up, I think P3 and I should focus on making strategic moves to advance.

Should we take calculated risks to close the gap with P1? Let's discuss carefully to maximize our chances of winning. I'm open to adjusting my strategy based on your thoughts.


Round 13, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To maximize my chances of winning, I'll analyze the current state. I'm at 17 steps, P2 is at 12, and P3 is at 11. Since we collided on 5 last round, I'll consider an alternative move. P2, if you take 1, I'll take 5. P3, if you take 5, I'll avoid it. If you both take different numbers, I'll take the highest number that doesn't collide with yours. Let's proceed strategically. I'm ready to make my move based on your decisions.

Since I'm 6 steps behind P1, I'll make my own strategic choice to either catch up significantly or force another collision if needed. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P2: Given the current state, I think P3 and I should prioritize making strategic moves to catch up with P1. Since P1 is giving mixed signals about their move, I suggest we focus on our own advancement. P3, consider taking a number that you think will give you the best chance to advance, and I'll do the same. Let's avoid relying on P1's hints and make our own calculated decisions. What do you think, P3? Should we take bold moves to try and close the gap with P1?
