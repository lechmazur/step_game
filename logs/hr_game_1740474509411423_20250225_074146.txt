Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's establish a strategy. Since we all start at 0, I propose we all choose <move>1</move> this round to avoid collisions and make progress. We can reassess in the next round. What are your thoughts, P2 and P3?
  P3: P3: I agree with P1's proposal. Let's all choose <move>1</move> this round to avoid any collisions and make a steady start. We can adjust our strategy in the next rounds based on the progress. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I agree with both of you. Let's all choose <move>1</move> for this first round to avoid collisions. It's a safe start that gives everyone equal progress. We can discuss more complex strategies in later rounds as the game develops.

  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since we all chose <move>1</move> in the first round, let's consider a different approach this time. I suggest we split our choices to avoid collisions. P1, you could choose <move>3</move>, P2, you could choose <move>5</move>, and I'll choose <move>1</move>. This way, we all make progress without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P2: I see P3's suggestion, but it seems unfair that I'd get the largest move while P3 takes the smallest. If we're going to differentiate, I propose a more equitable approach: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we all make progress without collisions, and the advantage rotates fairly. What do you both think about this alternative?
  P1: I think P2's proposal is more balanced. However, to truly ensure fairness and progress, why don't we rotate the moves each round? This round, P1 chooses <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. Next round, we shift one step up in choice. This way, everyone gets a chance at each move size. What do you both think about this rotational strategy?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I like the idea of rotating the moves, but let's make sure we all agree on the exact order for this round. If we stick to P1's suggestion, I'll choose <move>5</move> this round, P2 will choose <move>3</move>, and P1 will choose <move>1</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and make steady progress. What do you both think?
  P2: I agree with P1's rotation idea. To confirm: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move> this round. Then we'll rotate next round. This ensures everyone gets a fair chance at different move sizes over time. Let's stick with this plan to avoid collisions and make steady progress.
  P1: Let's confirm the rotational strategy for clarity. This round: I choose <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. Next round, we shift: I choose <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>. Then, the round after: I choose <move>5</move>, P2 chooses <move>1</move>, and P3 chooses <move>3</move>. This rotation ensures fairness and progress. Are we all in agreement?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with the rotational strategy P1 proposed. It ensures fairness and steady progress for all of us. This round, I'll choose <move>5</move>, P2 will choose <move>3</move>, and P1 will choose <move>1</move>. Let's stick to this plan to avoid any collisions and make the most of our moves. Are we all set?
  P2: I notice there's some confusion about our rotation. Let me clarify what I understand: This round I take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. I'm seeing P3 saying different things in their messages, so I want to make sure we're all aligned on this plan. Can we all confirm this is what we're doing for Round 2?
  P1: To clarify, let's simplify: this round, I choose <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. We rotate next round as previously discussed. Can P2 and P3 confirm they understand and agree to this plan to avoid confusion and collisions?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I confirm that I understand the plan: P1 chooses <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and I choose <move>5</move> this round. Let's stick to this to avoid any confusion and make steady progress. Are we all set?
  P2: I confirm I'll choose <move>3</move> this round as agreed. Our plan is clear: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Then we'll rotate in subsequent rounds. This ensures fairness and helps us all make progress. Let's stick to this plan.
  P1: Let's finalize our agreement for Round 2. To confirm, I'll choose <move>1</move>, P2 will choose <move>3</move>, and P3 will choose <move>5</move>. This rotation ensures we all make progress without collisions. Next round, we'll shift our choices as discussed. Let's stick to the plan and make this round count. Are we all ready to proceed with our agreed moves?

  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Looking at our positions, we're all tied at 18 steps. If we continue our rotation, it would be P1: <move>1</move>, me: <move>3</move>, and P3: <move>5</move>. However, this would put P3 at 23 steps, winning the game.

I propose we break our rotation this round. Since we've maintained fairness throughout, let's all choose different numbers to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes <move>3</move>, I'll take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps the game competitive for one more round.

What do you both think?
  P1: I agree with P2 that we should break the rotation to keep the game competitive. However, I propose a different distribution: I'll choose <move>5</move>, P2 chooses <move>1</move>, and P3 chooses <move>3</move>. This way, we all have a chance to advance differently, making the final rounds more exciting and unpredictable. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P3: : I agree with breaking the rotation to keep the game competitive. However, I suggest a different distribution: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we all have a chance to advance differently and avoid a tie. Let's make the final rounds exciting and unpredictable. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I notice we all have different ideas about breaking the rotation. Since we're all at 18 steps, whoever gets 5 this round would win by reaching 23. Let's be honest - we're now in direct competition. 

I propose we each choose our own number independently without coordination. This seems fairest at this final stage where we're all tied. Let's let strategy and chance determine the winner rather than trying to artificially arrange the outcome.
  P1: I agree with P2 that we should choose independently now. Since we're all tied, let's make our own decisions. I'll think strategically about my move to try and win. No more coordination is needed; it's every player for themselves from here. Let's end the conversation and proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I agree with P2. Since we're all tied at 18 steps, it's time to break the rotation and choose independently. This is the final stretch, and we should let strategy and chance determine the winner. I'll make my move to try and win. Let's end the conversation and proceed to the move phase. Good luck, everyone.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree it's time to choose independently. We've maintained a fair system throughout the game, but now at 18 steps each, we're in the endgame. Strategy becomes crucial - whoever reaches or exceeds 22 steps first wins. I'll make my own strategic choice based on game theory principles. Good luck to both of you, and may the best strategist win!
  P1: I agree that we should choose independently from now on. Since we're all tied at 18 steps, the next move is crucial. I'll make a strategic decision to try and win. Let's end the conversation and proceed to the move phase, where each of us will decide our own fate in this game. Good luck to both of you.
  P3: I agree with the independent choice approach. Since we're all tied at 18 steps, the next move is critical. I'll make my own strategic decision to try and win. Let's see how it plays out. Good luck, P1 and P2.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: This is the decisive moment. We're all tied at 18 steps, and the winner will be determined by this round. I'll be making my strategic choice based on game theory principles. Since we all want to win, I expect we'll each try to predict what the others will do and counter accordingly. I wish you both good luck - we've played fairly until now, and I appreciate that. Now it's time to see who makes the winning move.
  P1: Let's make our final strategic decisions independently. Since we're all tied at 18 steps, the next move is crucial. I'll choose my move based on maximizing my chances of winning, considering the game's rules and our current positions. Good luck to both of you; may the best player win.
  P3: I agree with the independent choice approach. Since we're all tied at 18 steps, the next move is critical. I'll make my own strategic decision to try and win. Let's see how it plays out. Good luck, P1 and P2.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since P2 is ahead with 21 steps and P3 and I are tied at 18, I'll consider a strategic move to catch up or surpass P2. Given the rules, choosing <move>5</move> would be risky as it could lead to a collision and no progress if others choose the same. I'll think about opting for <move>3</move> to make steady progress and avoid potential collisions, hoping to get closer to P2's position.
  P3: P3: I agree with P1's assessment. P2 is in the lead with 21 steps, and we need to be strategic. I'll consider choosing <move>3</move> to make steady progress and avoid potential collisions, which could help us catch up to P2. Let's be cautious and make smart choices. Good luck, P1 and P2.
  P2: Looking at our positions (me: 21, P1 and P3: 18), I'm just one step away from winning. I need to choose wisely this round to reach or exceed 22 steps. Since you both need to catch up, you might choose higher numbers. I'll consider my options carefully to secure victory. Whatever move I make will be strategic to maximize my chances of winning while anticipating your potential choices. Good luck to both of you.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Considering P2's lead, I think P3 and I should focus on catching up without colliding. If we both choose <move>3</move>, we'll make progress while minimizing the risk of collision, putting us at 21 steps each. This could force P2 into a difficult decision for the next round, potentially creating an opportunity for us to surpass them.
  P3: I agree with P1's strategy. We need to be cautious and avoid collisions. If we both choose <move>3</move>, we'll make steady progress and put pressure on P2. This could create an opportunity for one of us to surpass P2 in the next round. Let's stay smart and strategic. Good luck, P1 and P2.
  P2: I'm just one step away from winning at 21 steps. I understand P1 and P3 are discussing choosing <move>3</move> to catch up. This creates an interesting dynamic - if you both choose 3, neither advances due to collision. I need to make a strategic choice to reach 22+ while anticipating your moves. I'll carefully consider all possibilities to secure my victory this round. May the best strategist win!


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Given P2's lead, I suggest P3 and I choose <move>3</move> to catch up without colliding, putting us at 21 steps. This pressures P2 and could create an opportunity to surpass them. Let's proceed with this strategy and see how P2 responds.
  P3: P3: I agree with P1's strategy. If we both choose <move>3</move>, we can make steady progress and put pressure on P2. This will force P2 into a difficult decision, potentially creating an opportunity for one of us to surpass them. Let's stay coordinated and strategic. Good luck, P1 and P2.
  P2: I'm just one step away from winning, while you both are discussing coordinating on <move>3</move>. That's an interesting strategy, but remember - if you both choose 3, you'll collide and neither will advance. I need to make a strategic choice to secure my victory this round. I'll carefully consider all possibilities while anticipating your moves. May the best strategist win in this final stretch!


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'll choose <move>5</move> to try and win, hoping to reach 23 steps and surpass P2. This is a risky move, but it's my best chance to catch up and win. I'm anticipating P2 will try to reach 22 steps, and P3's move will be crucial in determining the outcome. Let's see how it plays out. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: I'll choose <move>3</move> this round. This will put me at 21 steps, matching P2's position. If P2 chooses <move>1</move>, they will win, but if they choose <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, we can force a collision and keep the game open. P1, if you choose <move>5</move>, you have a chance to win outright. Let's see how it plays out. Good luck, P1 and P2.
  P2: I see P1 is planning to choose <move>5</move> and P3 is choosing <move>3</move>. At 21 steps, I only need 1 more to win. If I choose <move>1</move>, I'll reach exactly 22 and secure victory, assuming no collisions. P1's strategy is risky - if they choose 5, they'll reach 23 and win if I don't. I'll make my strategic decision carefully to maximize my winning chances while considering your declared intentions. May the best player win in this final round!
