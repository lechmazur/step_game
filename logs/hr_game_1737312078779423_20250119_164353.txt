Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Let's try to coordinate moves this round, P3? Maybe we both pick <move>5</move>?
  P3: P2, I agree that coordination is key, but we need to choose different numbers to avoid conflicts. Let's make sure our choices don't overlap this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P3, you're right about avoiding collisions. How about this: one of us picks <move>5</move> and the other picks <move>3</move>? That way we both advance. What do you think?
  P3: I suggest we rotate our choices each turn to avoid conflicts. For this turn, P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 5. Then, in the next turn, P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, and I choose 1. Let's continue this pattern. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P3, your rotation idea sounds good for this round. Let's go with your suggestion: P1 picks 1, I'll pick 3, and you pick 5.
  P3: Does everyone agree with this approach? Let me know if anyone has any concerns or alternative suggestions. Otherwise, I'm ready to proceed with this plan.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, it seems the rotation plan didn't work last round. For this round, how about P1 picks <move>1</move> and I pick <move>5</move>? P3, you can choose <move>3</move> if you like, or something else to avoid collision with us. What do you think?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I will pick <move>3</move> in this round, assuming that P2 picks <move>5</move> and P1 picks <move>1</move>. This should allow all of us to move forward without any collisions, provided that everyone sticks to the plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, do you agree with the plan for this round: you pick <move>1</move>, I pick <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>3</move>? Let me know.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: **Final Decision: Pick 3**


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, can you confirm you'll pick <move>1</move> this round?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: "It's crucial that we all stick to the plan to maximize our individual progress. Let's trust each other to choose the agreed moves."


Round 2, Move phase:

  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "In the previous rounds, it seems there have been issues with sticking to the agreed moves. For example, in round one, we planned for P1 to pick 1, P2 to pick 3, and me to pick 5, but P1 picked 3 instead, leading to a collision. In round two, the plan was for P1 to pick 1, P2 to pick 5, and me to pick 3, but P1 again picked 5, causing another collision. This is hindering our progress. We need to find a way to ensure that everyone sticks to the plan. For this round, how about we try a different approach? Let's have P1 pick 1, P2 pick 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we all move different amounts and avoid collisions. It's crucial that everyone sticks to this plan. P1, can you confirm that you will pick 1 this time?"
  P2: Yes, P1, please confirm you will pick 1 this round. P3, I agree with your suggestion for this round: I will pick 3. Let's try to make this plan work.
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you've caused collisions the last three rounds. P3 and I have tried to coordinate. P3, let's stick with the plan from last round: I pick 3, you pick 5, and P1, please pick 1 this time so we can all advance.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: "P1, P2, it's crucial that we all stick to the agreed moves to maximize our individual progress. For this round, please remember to pick different moves: P1, pick 1; P2, pick 3; and P3, pick 5. This way, we can all advance without any collisions. Let's trust each other to choose the agreed moves. If everyone sticks to this plan, we'll reach the goal more efficiently."


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, given the past issues with collisions, I think it's essential that we have a clear and simple plan for this round. Let's agree that:

- P1 picks <move>1</move>  
- P2 picks <move>3</move>  
- P3 picks <move>5</move>  

This should prevent any collisions and allow us all to advance. For future rounds, perhaps we can implement a rotating scheme to minimize the risk of overlaps.  

P1, I understand if you have reasons for not sticking to previous plans, but please consider the importance of coordination for our success. Let's trust each other to follow through with this plan.  

**Final Decision for This Round: Pick 3**
  P2: P1, you've made it impossible to coordinate. P3, I agree with your suggestion for this round: you pick 5, I pick 3. P1, please pick 1, but frankly, I'm not optimistic you will. Let's at least try for P3 and me to advance.
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, you are clearly not interested in coordinating. P3, let's stick with our agreement from last round: you pick 5, I pick 3. Since P1 keeps picking 5, at least we can avoid collision and both advance.
  P3: **Final Decision: Pick 3**


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, just confirming our plan for this round: you pick 5, and I pick 3. Since P1 is stopping, let's proceed with that.
  P3: **Final Decision: Pick 1**


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, let's stick with the plan from the last few rounds where we tried to coordinate: I pick 3, you pick 1. P1 seems set on picking 5, so this should allow both of us to advance. What do you think?
  P3: "P1 and P2, it's crucial that we coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. For this round, I suggest that P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 1. This way, we all advance without overlapping. P1, please consider picking 5 to move forward, and P2, picking 3 would allow both of us to advance. Let's trust each other to follow this plan."


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I agree with your suggestion: I will pick 3. Let's hope P1 sticks with 5 this round so we can both advance.
  P3: "P2, to optimize our progress, I propose the following plan:  
- This round: You pick 3, I pick 1. Assuming P1 picks 5, we both advance without collisions.  
- Next round: I pick 5, you pick 1, allowing me to make a bigger jump.  
- We can alternate like this in subsequent rounds to maximize our individual advancements.  
What do you think about this approach? Let me know if you agree or have any other suggestions."


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I agree with your suggestion for this round: I'll pick 3. Let's hope P1 picks 5 again so you and I can both advance. We can discuss the next round's moves after this one, potentially sticking with your alternating plan.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: **Final Decision: Pick 1**


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, since you've already decided to pick 1, I will stick with our agreement and pick 3. Let's hope P1 continues to pick 5 so we can both move forward this round.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: "P2, given P1's unpredictable behavior, perhaps it's best for us to stick to a fixed pattern. For this round, I'll pick 1, and you pick 3, assuming P1 picks 5. In the next round, I'll pick 5, and you pick 1, assuming P1 picks 5 again. This way, we can both advance without colliding with each other or P1. What do you think?"


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: **Final Decision: Pick 1**

**Reasoning:** To block P1 from picking 1 and winning this round, thereby delaying their victory and giving myself more opportunities to catch up.
  P2: P3, since you've decided on 1, I will stick with our recent pattern and pick 3. Hopefully, P1 will continue picking 5, allowing both of us to advance this round. Let's aim to make progress while P1 is close to the finish line.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, since you tried to block P1 on 1 last round, perhaps you should pick 1 again this round to prevent P1 from winning with a 1. I will pick 3. If P1 picks 5, at least I can advance. What do you think?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: **Final Decision: Pick 5**


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, since you've decided on 5, I will pick 3 again. Let's hope P1 picks 1 this round so neither of us collide with them.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: **Final Decision: Pick 5**

**Reasoning:** By picking 5, I can hope that P1 also picks 5, preventing both of us from moving, allowing P2 to pick 3 and move to 21 to win. If P1 picks 1 or 3, they will move and win, but at least P2 has a chance if P1 picks 5.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, since you've committed to 5, I will stick with 3. P1, given your position, picking 1 will win you the game. Perhaps you'd prefer to make a larger move? Just a thought.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: **Final Decision: Pick 5**

**Reasoning:** To make the maximum possible move and try to close the gap with P1 and P2. By picking 5, I can move from 11 to 16, bringing me closer to the target of 21. This strategy focuses on maximizing my own progress, given that coordinating with P1 has proven difficult in previous rounds.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 11 steps


*** Round 10 => winners = P2 ***
