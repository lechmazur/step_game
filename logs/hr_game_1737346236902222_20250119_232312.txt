Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 this round. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3's suggestion seems logical, but I propose we rotate the numbers each round to ensure fairness. For example, this round: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5; next round: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1; and so on. This way, no one is consistently disadvantaged. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2's rotation idea sounds fair. Let's try it starting this round with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. If it works well, we can continue rotating in subsequent rounds. Agreed?
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Agreed to the rotation plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 this round. Let’s stick to it and avoid deviations to prevent collisions. If anyone has concerns, speak now. Otherwise,


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm glad we've agreed on the rotation plan. Let's stick to it and see how it goes. If anyone feels the need to adjust the strategy in future rounds, we can discuss it then. For now, P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 should work well. Let's make our moves accordingly.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Since we’ve agreed to the rotation plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5), let’s commit to it fully this round. Any deviation risks collisions and slows progress for everyone. Trust is key here—let’s prove we can cooperate effectively. If this works, we can refine the strategy in future rounds.
