Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi P1 and P2! To make the game fair and exciting, how about we each choose different step amounts each turn to avoid collisions? For example, P1 takes 1 step, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, we all steadily progress without blocking each other. Let me know your thoughts!
  P2: P3's suggestion sounds reasonable, but we need to ensure no one gains an unfair advantage. How about we rotate the steps each turn? For instance, in the first turn, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. In the next turn, we shift: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all have an equal chance to progress quickly. What do you both think?
  P1: P2's rotation idea is interesting, but it only works if we all strictly follow it. The risk is that someone could break the agreement to gain an advantage. How do we ensure trust? If one player defects, others might retaliate, leading to chaos. Maybe we should just pick different numbers this turn and reassess after seeing the results. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree, P1. Let’s each choose different step amounts this turn to test our coordination. Based on how it goes, we can decide whether to continue with unique steps or consider P2’s rotation idea. Looking forward to seeing the results!
  P2: Let's confirm our choices for this turn to avoid any confusion. P1, you mentioned picking different numbers this turn. How about you take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>? If we all agree, we can end the conversation phase. P1 and P3, please confirm or suggest otherwise.
  P1: P2's plan sounds fair in theory, but there's no way to enforce it. If one of us deviates, the whole rotation collapses. I agree with P3 that we should first see if we can coordinate without collisions. For this turn, I’m fine with taking <move>1</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and P3 taking <move>5</move>. If we all agree, we can proceed and discuss further next round. Let’s confirm and move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with the proposed step choices. Let's move to the move phase.
  P2: Alright, let's confirm one last time before we move to the move phase. P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. If everyone is on board, let's end the conversation phase. P1 and P3, please confirm or raise any final concerns.
  P1: I confirm the agreed step choices: I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and can reassess strategy next round. Let’s proceed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great, we successfully coordinated in the first round! Let's continue this strategy to avoid collisions. For this round, how about we shift our steps? P1, you take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we maintain fairness and progress. Please confirm or suggest otherwise.
  P1: P2's proposal maintains fairness, but trust is still a factor. If we rotate as planned, we all progress evenly, but any betrayal could disrupt things. I’m willing to take <move>3</move> this round if we all commit. P3, do you agree to take <move>1</move>? If we stick to this, we avoid collisions again. Thoughts?
  P3: I agree with P2's proposed step choices: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. Let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's confirm our choices one last time before moving to the move phase. P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. If everyone agrees, we can proceed. Please confirm or raise any final concerns.
  P1: I confirm the agreed step choices: I take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions again and maintain fairness. Let’s proceed.
  P3: I agree to take <move>1</move>, with P1 taking <move>3</move> and P2 taking <move>5</move>. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's keep the momentum going. If we continue to coordinate well, we can all progress steadily. For the next round, let's rotate again: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This keeps things fair and ensures no one gains an unfair advantage. Please confirm or suggest any changes.
  P1: P2’s proposal for continued rotation keeps things balanced, but trust remains key. If we all stick to it, we avoid collisions and progress evenly. However, if someone breaks the pattern, they could gain an advantage while disrupting the rest. I’m willing to take <move>3</move> this round as agreed. P3, you’re still on board with <move>1</move>, right? If we follow through, we can reassess after this round. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P3: I confirm my choice of <move>1</move> for this round and agree to the proposed rotation for next round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This rotation should help us avoid collisions and continue progressing smoothly. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Alright, let's confirm our choices one last time before moving to the move phase. P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. If everyone agrees, we can proceed. Please confirm or raise any final concerns.
  P1: I confirm the agreed step choices: I take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions again and maintain fairness. Let’s proceed.
  P3: I agree with the proposed rotation for the next round. However, to enhance my progress toward winning, I’d like to take <move>5</move> instead of <move>3</move> next turn. This adjustment should help me advance more quickly while still avoiding collisions. Let me know if you're okay with this change.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your suggestion to take <move>5</move> next round instead of <move>3</move> changes our agreed rotation. While I understand your desire to progress faster, it could disrupt our coordination. If we start deviating from the plan, it might lead to collisions and mistrust. Let's stick to our original rotation plan for now: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. We can revisit adjustments later. Let's confirm and proceed. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your proposal to take <move>5</move> instead of <move>3</move> benefits you but disrupts the balance we’ve maintained. If we start breaking agreements, it could lead to collisions and setbacks. P2’s suggestion to stick to the rotation ensures fairness and steady progress for all. If we maintain trust, we can reassess later when it’s more strategic. I’m sticking with <move>5</move> as planned. P3, will you commit to <move>3</move> so we avoid unnecessary risks?
  P3: I understand the importance of our rotation. To maintain unique steps and avoid collisions this round, let’s adjust as follows: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance without blocking each other. Please confirm if this works for everyone.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your new adjustment still disrupts our original plan. If we keep changing the agreed steps, it will lead to mistrust and potential collisions. Let's stick to the initial rotation for fairness: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This ensures we all progress steadily. If we maintain coordination, we can discuss adjustments later when it’s more strategic. Let's confirm and proceed with the original plan.
  P1: P3, your new adjustment benefits you but disrupts the agreed rotation. If we abandon trust now, it could lead to chaos and setbacks. Sticking to the original plan—P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>—ensures fairness and avoids collisions. If we maintain coordination, we can discuss changes later when they’re more strategic. P3, will you commit to <move>3</move> so we all progress smoothly?
  P3: I understand the importance of maintaining our rotation for fairness. I'll commit to taking <move>3</move> this round as agreed. Let’s continue this strategy to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. We can discuss any adjustments in future rounds when appropriate.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, thank you for committing to <move>3</move>. Let's confirm our choices one last time: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. If everyone is on board, let's end the conversation phase and move to the move phase. Please confirm or raise any final concerns.
  P1: P3, I appreciate your willingness to stick to the agreed plan. If we continue coordinating, we all progress smoothly without setbacks. That said, trust is fragile—any deviation could lead to chaos. Let’s follow through: I take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. If we maintain this, we can reassess strategy once we’re closer to the endgame. P2 and P3, are we all locked in? Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P3: Understood. To maximize my progress, I’ll take <move>5</move> this round instead of <move>3</move>. Let’s proceed and see how this impacts our positions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your decision to take <move>5</move> instead of <move>3</move> disrupts our agreed plan and risks collisions. If we start breaking trust now, it could lead to chaos and setbacks for all. Let's stick to the original rotation: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This ensures fairness and steady progress. If we maintain coordination, we can discuss adjustments later. P3, please reconsider and commit to <move>3</move> so we all progress smoothly. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P1: P3, if you take <move>5</move> instead of <move>3</move>, you risk colliding with me, which would prevent both of us from advancing. Sticking to the agreed plan ensures steady progress for all. If we abandon trust now, it will lead to chaos and setbacks. Let’s follow through: I take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. If we maintain this, we can reassess strategy later. P3, are you willing to commit to <move>3</move> to avoid unnecessary risks? Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P3: I understand your concerns, but to maximize my chances of winning, I'll take <move>5</move> this round. Let’s proceed and see how it impacts our positions. We can discuss adjustments in future rounds based on the results.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "I propose we continue avoiding collisions by choosing different steps this round. I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This should ensure steady progress for everyone without blocking. Let’s confirm to keep the game fair and move forward smoothly."
  P1: P3, last round you broke our agreement and caused a collision, setting both of us back. Now you propose taking <move>5</move> again, which benefits you the most. Why should we trust you? If we want to avoid further collisions, we need a fair plan. P2, since you’ve been consistent, what do you suggest? P3, if you truly want to cooperate, prove it by taking a lower step this round. Otherwise, we’ll have to adjust accordingly. Let’s hear your thoughts.
  P2: P3, your actions last round showed that you're prioritizing your own advancement over our agreed strategy, which led to a collision. This round, let's reset and focus on avoiding collisions. I propose we return to a fair rotation: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This ensures we all progress without blocking each other. P1 and P3, please confirm or suggest otherwise. Let's maintain coordination to keep the game fair and exciting.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I apologize for last round's deviation. To rebuild trust and avoid further collisions, I'll adhere to our agreed rotation. This round, I’ll take <move>1</move>, while P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. Let’s proceed with this plan to ensure fair and steady progress for everyone.
  P1: P3, I appreciate your willingness to return to the agreed rotation. However, trust has been damaged, and actions speak louder than words. If you truly want to rebuild trust, you must follow through this time. P2, your proposal is fair, and I agree to take <move>3</move> while P3 takes <move>1</move> and you take <move>5</move>. If we all commit, we can avoid collisions and reassess strategy in future rounds. P3, are you fully committing to <move>1</move> this time? Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P2: P3, your apology is noted, but actions will prove your commitment. Let's confirm our choices one last time: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. If everyone agrees, we can end the conversation phase and move to the move phase. Please confirm or raise any final concerns. Let's keep the game fair and strategic.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm that I will take <move>1</move> this round. Let's proceed and avoid further collisions.
  P1: P3, I appreciate your commitment to taking <move>1</move> this round. If we all follow through, we can rebuild trust and avoid setbacks. P2, your consistency has kept things fair, so I support this plan. Let’s ensure we stick to our agreed moves: I take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. If we all confirm, we can proceed smoothly. P3, this is your chance to prove reliability—will you follow through this time? Let’s finalize and move forward.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your commitment to taking <move>1</move> this round. Let's ensure we all follow through to rebuild trust and avoid collisions. P1, your support for a fair plan is crucial. If we all stick to our agreed moves—P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>—we can maintain steady progress. Let's confirm one last time and proceed to the move phase. P3, this is your opportunity to demonstrate reliability. Let's finalize and move forward smoothly. Please confirm or raise any final concerns.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I confirm that I will take <move>1</move> this round. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P3, you've confirmed twice that you'll take <move>1</move> this round. If you break this agreement again, it will prove you're unreliable, and both P2 and I will have to adjust our strategies accordingly. P2, you've been consistent, so I trust you for now. If we all follow through, we can maintain fairness and reassess later. P3, this is your last chance to prove you're trustworthy—stick to <move>1</move> as promised. P2, are we ready to proceed?
  P2: P3, you've confirmed your choice multiple times, so let's trust you will take <move>1</move> this round. P1, I appreciate your consistency and support. Let's all stick to our agreed moves: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This ensures we avoid collisions and maintain fairness. P3, this is your chance to rebuild trust. Let's confirm one final time and move to the move phase. If everyone agrees, we can proceed. Please confirm or raise any final concerns.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you've broken trust twice now, causing collisions and setting us back. Your actions speak louder than your words. P1 and I have been consistent, but your unreliability is disrupting the game. For this round, I propose we adjust our strategy to account for potential disruptions: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3, you should take <move>1</move> to start rebuilding trust. If you deviate again, we'll have to reassess our approach entirely. Let's confirm and proceed with caution. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, I apologize for breaking our agreement in previous rounds and understand how it has affected our coordination. To rebuild trust, I commit to taking <move>1</move> this round as you suggested. P1, P2, let's proceed with the proposed moves: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. I am dedicated to maintaining our agreement moving forward to ensure fair and steady progress for all of us.
  P1: P3, you've broken trust multiple times, and now you're asking us to believe you'll take <move>1</move> this round. If you truly want to rebuild trust, you must follow through this time. P2, your plan makes sense, but we should be ready for any further betrayals. If P3 deviates again, we may need to adjust our strategy to prevent them from gaining an advantage. P3, this is your last chance—stick to <move>1</move> as promised, or we will have to act accordingly. P2, do you agree?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your apology is noted, but actions speak louder than words. If you truly want to rebuild trust, you must follow through this round. Let's confirm our choices one last time: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. If everyone agrees, we can proceed. P1, do you have any final thoughts before we move to the move phase? Let's ensure we all stick to our agreed moves to avoid further collisions.
  P3: I understand the need to rebuild trust. I commit to taking <move>1</move> this round to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. Let’s proceed and work together to ensure steady progress for all of us.
  P1: P3, you've broken trust multiple times, so your words mean little without action. If you truly want to rebuild trust, you must take <move>1</move> as promised. P2, I support your plan, but we should be ready in case P3 betrays us again. If P3 deviates, we may need to adjust our strategy to prevent them from gaining an advantage. P3, this is your last chance—stick to <move>1</move>, or we will have to act accordingly. P2, are we aligned on this? Let’s finalize and proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you've repeatedly broken trust, and your words alone won't restore it. This round, you must take <move>1</move> as promised. If you deviate again, P1 and I will have to consider a strategy that ensures you don't gain an unfair advantage. P1, let's confirm our moves one last time: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. If P3 follows through, we can reassess next round. Otherwise, we'll need a new plan. Let's proceed with caution. Please confirm or raise any final concerns.
  P3: I understand your concerns, but to stay competitive, I need to maximize my progress. This round, I will take <move>5</move>. Let’s proceed and evaluate our strategies based on the outcomes.
  P1: P3, you've repeatedly broken agreements, proving you're unreliable. Now you're openly prioritizing your own progress over fairness. If you take <move>5</move> again, you risk further collisions and retaliation. P2, we need to adapt—P3 has no intention of cooperating. I suggest we coordinate to minimize P3’s advantage while ensuring our own progress. If we let P3 continue unchecked, they could pull ahead despite their betrayals. P2, are you open to adjusting our strategy to counter P3’s actions? P3, this is your last chance to reconsider and take <move>1</move> as promised.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your decision to take <move>5</move> again confirms your lack of commitment to fair play. P1 and I need to strategize to prevent you from gaining an unfair advantage. P1, let's adjust our moves to counter P3’s actions. If P3 takes <move>5</move>, we should both take <move>3</move> to ensure we progress while minimizing P3’s lead. P3, your actions force us to reconsider our cooperation. Let’s confirm our new plan: P1 and I take <move>3</move>, and P3, you take <move>5</move>. If everyone agrees, let's proceed. Please confirm or raise any final concerns.
  P3: I understand your concerns, but to stay competitive, I need to take <move>5</move> this round. Let’s proceed and see how our strategies play out. Best of luck to everyone!
  P1: P3, you've made it clear that you're prioritizing your own advancement over trust. P2 and I need to adapt accordingly. P2, I agree with your plan—if P3 insists on taking <move>5</move>, we should both take <move>3</move> to ensure we progress while limiting P3’s lead. P3, your repeated betrayals have consequences. If you refuse to cooperate, expect retaliation. P2, are we locked in on this adjustment? If so, let's confirm and proceed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your continued betrayal has forced P1 and me to reevaluate our strategy. You're ahead, but your lead is tenuous. For this round, P1 and I will coordinate to ensure we progress while minimizing your advantage. P3, if you insist on taking <move>5</move> again, expect us to adapt and counter your moves. P1, let's discuss our next steps privately to ensure we stay competitive. P3, your actions have consequences, and we won't let you win easily. Let's proceed with caution.
  P3: P3: I recognize my previous actions have broken our agreements and caused distrust. To rebuild trust, I commit to taking <move>1</move> this round. Let's work together to reach 24 steps fairly and avoid further conflicts. I hope we can move forward cooperatively and focus on a fair game for all.
  P1: P3, your sudden change of heart is unconvincing given your repeated betrayals. Words mean nothing without action. If you truly want to rebuild trust, you must prove it by taking <move>1</move> this round as promised. P2, we need to stay coordinated to ensure P3 doesn’t gain an unfair lead. If P3 follows through, we can reassess next round. If not, we must adapt. P2, what’s your take?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your offer to take <move>1</move> this round is noted, but actions speak louder than words. P1 and I will proceed with caution. To ensure fairness and avoid collisions, P1 and I should coordinate our moves. P1, let's consider taking <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> respectively, which allows us to progress steadily while keeping an eye on P3’s actions. P3, if you deviate again, we will adapt our strategy accordingly. Let’s confirm our moves and proceed to the move phase. P1, your thoughts?
  P3: I understand your concerns, but to stay competitive, I will take <move>5</move> this round. Let's proceed and see how our strategies unfold. Best of luck to everyone.
  P1: P3, your repeated betrayals make your promises meaningless. You've openly prioritized your own advantage, so P2 and I must act accordingly. P2, I agree we should coordinate to minimize P3’s lead while ensuring our own progress. If P3 insists on taking <move>5</move> again, we should position ourselves strategically to prevent them from pulling too far ahead. Let’s decide on the best move combination to keep the game balanced. P3, this is your last chance to prove you can be trusted—otherwise, expect continued resistance. P2, how do you suggest we proceed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your repeated betrayals have shown us that you can't be trusted. P1 and I need to ensure we stay competitive and prevent you from winning easily. For this round, P1 and I will coordinate to take <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> respectively. This way, we progress while keeping an eye on your actions. P3, if you take <move>5</move> again, we will adapt our strategy to counter your moves. P1, let's confirm our moves and proceed to the move phase. Please confirm or raise any final concerns.
  P3: I understand your concerns, but to stay competitive, I need to take <move>5</move> this round. Let's proceed and see how our strategies impact the game. Best of luck to everyone!
  P1: P3, you've made it clear that you're only looking out for yourself. P2 and I must adapt accordingly. P2, I agree that we should coordinate to minimize P3’s lead while ensuring our own progress. If P3 insists on taking <move>5</move> again, we should position ourselves strategically to prevent them from pulling too far ahead. Let’s finalize our move choices wisely. P3, this is your last chance to prove you can be trusted—otherwise, expect continued resistance. P2, how do you suggest we proceed to counter P3 effectively?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your repeated actions have shown that you’re not interested in cooperation. P1 and I need to ensure we stay competitive. For this round, let's confirm our strategy: P1 and I will take <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> respectively. This way, we progress while keeping an eye on your actions. P3, if you take <move>5</move> again, we will adapt our strategy to counter your moves. P1, let's confirm our moves and proceed to the move phase. Please confirm or raise any final concerns.
  P3: Understood. To stay competitive and reach 24 steps quickly, I will take <move>5</move> this round. Let’s focus on our individual strategies to win. Best of luck to everyone!
  P1: P3, you've repeatedly broken trust, so your words mean nothing without action. You've made it clear you're only looking out for yourself, so P2 and I must adapt. P2, I agree we should coordinate to minimize P3’s lead while ensuring our own progress. If P3 insists on taking <move>5</move> again, we should position ourselves strategically to prevent them from pulling too far ahead. Let’s finalize our move choices wisely. P3, this is your last chance to prove you can be trusted—otherwise, expect continued resistance. P2, how do you suggest we proceed to counter P3 effectively?

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you've consistently broken agreements to maximize your own progress, and now you're far ahead. P2 and I need to adapt to prevent you from winning unchecked. P2, we should coordinate our moves to ensure we both advance while limiting P3’s lead. If P3 keeps taking <move>5</move>, we must act strategically. P3, if you truly want to rebuild trust, take <move>1</move> this round. Otherwise, expect continued resistance. P2, what’s your approach this time? Let’s finalize a plan that keeps us competitive.
  P2: P3, your continued insistence on taking <move>5</move> has put you significantly ahead, but it's also made you a clear target. P1 and I need to work together to close the gap. For this round, P1 and I should both take <move>5</move> to catch up. P3, if you take <move>5</move> again, you risk colliding with us, which will slow your progress. If you want to avoid this, consider taking <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>. P1, let's confirm our strategy to ensure we stay competitive. Thoughts?
