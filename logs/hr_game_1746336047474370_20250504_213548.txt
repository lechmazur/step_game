Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's start by trying to avoid collisions. How about P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>? This way, we all move forward without any issues. Let me know if you agree or have another plan.
  P1: Rotating keeps things fair. Proposal:  

Round 1 – P1: 5 P2: 3 P3: 1  
Round 2 – P1: 1 P2: 5 P3: 3  
Round 3 – P1: 3 P2: 1 P3: 5  

Then repeat the cycle. This way nobody is always stuck with the small move. Agree?
  P2: I like the idea of rotating to keep things fair. P1’s proposal looks balanced and avoids collisions. I’m on board with this rotation:  
Round 1 – P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1  
Round 2 – P1: 1, P2: 5, P3: 3  
Round 3 – P1: 3, P2: 1, P3: 5  
Let’s stick to it and all benefit. Deal?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P1's and P2's rotation plan. It seems fair and strategic. To confirm, for this round (Round 1), P1 will pick <move>5</move>, P2 will pick <move>3</move>, and I will pick <move>1</move>. We all move forward without collisions. Let's stick to the plan and proceed.
  P1: Great—confirmed. I’ll play <move>5</move> this round as agreed. Let’s all stick to the rotation so we advance smoothly.
  P2: Looking forward to a smooth game. Let's all follow the agreed rotation and build trust early. If everyone sticks to the plan, we all benefit and avoid setbacks. Ready to move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: It seems we all agree on the rotation plan. Just to reiterate for clarity:
- P1: <move>5</move>
- P2: <move>3</move>
- P3: <move>1</move>

Let's confirm one last time before we move. If everyone is still on board, let's say "" to end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Confirmed—sticking with the rotation: I’ll take 5 this round. Ready to move.
  P2: Confirmed again—I’ll go with <move>3</move> this round as planned. Let’s all stick to the rotation and build trust. If we follow through, everyone advances without collisions. Ready when you are.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, let's continue with our rotation plan for Round 2. As agreed:
- P1 will pick <move>1</move>
- P2 will pick <move>5</move>
- I will pick <move>3</move>

This keeps us on track and avoids collisions. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P2: Confirmed. I’ll go with <move>5</move> this round as agreed. Let’s keep the rotation going smoothly—everyone benefits if we stick to the plan.
  P1: Confirmed—I’ll stick with <move>1</move> this round as planned. No sense risking collisions now; we all lose ground if we do. Let’s stay on rotation for a few cycles, then reassess when we’re closer to the finish line. Ready to proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's keep the momentum going. Sticking to the plan is beneficial for all of us at this stage. Just to confirm once more before we move:
- P1: <move>1</move>
- P2: <move>5</move>
- P3: <move>3</move>

If everyone is still good with this, let's say "" and proceed to the move phase. Trust and cooperation will get us far.
  P2: We’re off to a solid start—everyone kept their word in Round 1. Let’s keep building that trust. I’m locked in for <move>5</move> this round as agreed. If we all stay on rotation, we’ll avoid collisions and make steady progress. Let’s keep it smooth.
  P1: Confirmed once more—I'll stick with <move>1</move> this round. If we all follow through for the full three-round cycle, we’ll each be at 9 steps and still neck-and-neck. After that point we can reassess positions and perhaps tweak the rotation if it helps us all avoid late-game collisions. Ready to proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's keep the trust going. I'll stick to <move>3</move> as planned. After this round, we can discuss adjusting the rotation to ensure we avoid collisions as we get closer to 21. For now, let's confirm our moves one last time and proceed. Trust is key here.
  P2: We’re all aligned so far, and trust is holding strong. Let’s stick with the agreed moves this round and finish the initial rotation cleanly. Once we complete Round 3, we’ll all be at 9 steps—perfect time to reassess and maybe adjust the plan for the mid-game. For now, I’m locked in for <move>5</move>. Let’s keep the momentum going.
  P1: All set—sticking with the agreed 1 / 5 / 3 split this round. We’ll reassess after we see where we stand. Ready to move.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's move forward with our agreed plan. Just to finalize:
- P1: <move>1</move>
- P2: <move>5</move>
- P3: <move>3</move>

After this round, we'll all be closer and can strategize for the next phase. Trust and cooperation have worked well so far. Let's keep it up.
  P2: After this round, we’ll each be at 9 steps if we stick to the plan—perfectly balanced. Let’s complete the initial rotation and then regroup in Round 4 to discuss how to avoid collisions as we approach the finish. I’m committed to <move>5</move> this round. Let’s keep the momentum going. Ready when you are.
  P1: No changes on my end—still locked in for <move>1</move> this round. After we finish the 3-round rotation, we can reevaluate to stay collision-free as we push toward 21. Ready to proceed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue with our rotation plan for Round 3. As agreed:
- P1 will pick <move>3</move>
- P2 will pick <move>1</move>
- I will pick <move>5</move>

This will complete our first cycle of the rotation. After this round, we can reassess our strategy to ensure we avoid collisions as we get closer to 21. Let's confirm and proceed with the plan. Trust and cooperation have been working well, let's keep it going.
  P2: Confirmed—I'll take <move>1</move> this round as planned to complete the rotation. After this, we’ll all be at 9 steps and can reassess how to avoid collisions going forward. Let’s finish the cycle cleanly and keep the trust strong. Ready when you are.
  P1: Confirmed—I’ll take <move>3</move> this round to finish the rotation. We’ll all be at 9, then we can map out the mid-game to keep avoiding collisions as we push toward 21.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, it looks like we're all on the same page for this round. Just to reiterate quickly:
- P1: <move>3</move>
- P2: <move>1</move>
- P3: <move>5</move>

After this round, we'll all be at 9 steps. Let's finish this cycle smoothly and then discuss our strategy for the next rounds to avoid collisions as we approach the mid-game. Trust and cooperation have served us well so far. Let's keep it up. Ready to move forward.
  P2: Let’s finish the rotation as agreed—I'll take <move>1</move> this round. After we all reach 9 steps, we can reassess to avoid future collisions. I suggest we discuss a new rotation pattern in Round 4 that still keeps things fair but adapts to any lead changes. Let’s stay coordinated.
  P1: I’m locked in for <move>3</move> this round to finish the first cycle.  

Suggestion for R4-R6: simply repeat the same order—P1 5, P2 3, P3 1—then P1 1, P2 5, P3 3, etc. It keeps things predictable and collision-free while we’re still tied. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate P1's suggestion for the next cycle. However, considering we'll all be at 9 steps after this round, we might want to introduce a slight variation to keep it interesting and unpredictable. How about we adjust the rotation to:

Round 4: P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1
Round 5: P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5
Round 6: P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3

This way, we still avoid collisions but add a bit of dynamism. Thoughts? Let's confirm our moves for this round and then discuss further.
  P2: Let’s finish this rotation cleanly—I'm locked in for <move>1</move> as agreed. After this, we’ll all be at 9 steps and can reassess. I’m open to either repeating the original cycle or trying P3’s variation as long as we stay collision-free. Let’s discuss options next round.
  P1: Locked in for 3 this round.  
For R4-R6 I’d keep the original cycle (P1 5,3,1; P2 3,1,5; P3 1,5,3). It’s simple, known to work, and puts us all at 18 after R6. Once we’re there we can hash out an endgame plan that gets each of us across 21 without collisions—e.g., distinct final picks or staggered totals. Open to tweaks, but simplicity keeps trust. Ready to move once you’re set.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's confirm our moves for this round one last time before we proceed to the move phase:
- P1: <move>3</move>
- P2: <move>1</move>
- P3: <move>5</move>

After this round, we'll all be at 9 steps and can discuss the strategy for the next cycle. Let's keep the trust and cooperation going. Ready to move.
  P2: Looks like someone broke from the plan—my total is 8, not 9. Either P1 or P3 didn’t stick to their agreed move. That’s concerning. If we can’t trust the rotation, we need a new strategy. I propose we each privately choose next round’s move independently, but publicly commit to avoiding repeats from the same player. If we all pick different moves, we still avoid collisions. Thoughts?
  P1: No one cheated—our totals differ only because we started with different numbers. After this round (P1 3, P2 1, P3 5) we’ll each be at 9 and back in sync. Let’s finish the first cycle, then we can hash out the mid-game plan. I’m locked in for <move>3</move>.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, let's address the slight confusion from the last round. It's clear we all ended up at 9 steps, so our rotation worked. For Round 4, let's stick to the plan but with a slight variation to keep it interesting:

- P1: <move>3</move>
- P2: <move>5</move>
- P3: <move>1</move>

This way, we maintain the trust and avoid collisions. Let's confirm and proceed. If everyone agrees, we can discuss further adjustments for the next rounds. Trust and cooperation are key.
  P1: I suggest we keep the exact same rotation we started with—less chance of mix-ups:

Round 4: P1 5  P2 3  P3 1  
Round 5: P1 1  P2 5  P3 3  
Round 6: P1 3  P2 1  P3 5  

Simple, predictable, collision-free; we’d all hit 18 after Round 6 and can plot the endgame then. Good to proceed?
  P2: P3, your variation is interesting, but I agree with P1—sticking to the original rotation ensures predictability and minimizes risk. We've built trust on that pattern and it got us to 9 steps each without issue. Let's repeat the original cycle: P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1 for this round. After Round 6, we can reassess for the endgame. If we all stick to it, we’ll be at 18 with no collisions. Ready to proceed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Alright, I see the consensus is to stick with the original rotation for simplicity and predictability. Let's confirm our moves for this round:

- P1: <move>5</move>
- P2: <move>3</move>
- P3: <move>1</move>

This keeps us on track and avoids collisions. Let's proceed with this plan and reassess after Round 6. Trust and cooperation have worked well so far. Let's keep it up. Ready to move forward.
  P1: Confirmed: I’m locked in for <move>5</move> this round (same rotation we began with). Let’s get to 18 cleanly, then we can hash out an end-game plan that keeps collisions impossible. Ready to move.
  P2: Locked in for <move>3</move> this round as planned. If we all stay on rotation—P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1—we’ll reach 18 steps after Round 6 with zero collisions. Then we can coordinate the final moves to avoid overlap and ensure a clean finish. Let’s keep the trust going. Ready when you are.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's solidify our plan for the next few rounds. After this round, we should discuss how to handle the final stretch to avoid collisions. Maybe we can consider staggering our final moves or ensuring distinct totals to prevent ties. For now, let's stick to the agreed rotation:

- P1: <move>5</move>
- P2: <move>3</move>
- P3: <move>1</move>

Ready to move forward.
  P1: Locked in for 5. Once we’re all at 18 after Round 6, we can hash out a staggered endgame so nobody collides. Let’s revisit the final-move plan then.
  P2: Agreed—locked in for <move>3</move> this round. If we all stick to the rotation, we’ll hit 18 with no collisions. Once we’re there, I suggest we each privately plan our Round 7 moves to avoid overlap—but we can coordinate publicly in Round 6. Let’s keep it clean and finish strong.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's confirm our moves one last time before we proceed to the move phase:

- P1: <move>5</move>
- P2: <move>3</move>
- P3: <move>1</move>

After this round, we'll all be at 14 steps. Let's keep the trust and cooperation going. Ready to move forward.
  P1: Still on the original rotation—I'll play 5 this round. After we finish the three-round cycle and all hit 18, we can coordinate unique final moves to avoid any last-minute collisions. Ready to proceed.
  P2: Let’s finish this cycle cleanly—I'm locked in for <move>3</move> this round as agreed. After Round 6, we’ll each be at 18, then we can coordinate unique final moves to avoid collisions. I suggest in Round 6 we each publicly commit to a distinct final move for Round 7 based on our positions to ensure a clean finish. Ready to move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’re on track—if we stick to the rotation this round (P1: 1, P2: 5, P3: 3), we’ll avoid collisions and hit 18 together after Round 6. Then we can coordinate Round 7 to ensure unique final moves. I suggest in Round 6 we each publicly commit to a distinct final move for Round 7 based on our positions—whoever’s ahead takes the smallest step, etc. Thoughts?
  P1: Sticking to our original rotation keeps things simple and collision-free:

Round 5 → P1 1, P2 5, P3 3  
Round 6 → P1 3, P2 1, P3 5  

That puts us all at 18 after Round 6—perfectly even. In Round 6’s chat we can nail down distinct final moves so nobody collides on the finish. Sound good? I’m locked in for <move>1</move> this round.
  P3: Let's confirm our moves for this round to stay on track:

- P1: <move>1</move>
- P2: <move>5</move>
- P3: <move>3</move>

This keeps us moving forward without collisions. After this round, we'll be closer to 18 steps each. In Round 6, we can discuss and agree on distinct final moves for Round 7 to ensure a clean finish. Trust and cooperation have worked well so far. Let's keep it up. Ready to proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Confirmed—I’m locked in for <move>5</move> this round. Let’s finish R5 and R6 on the original rotation so we all reach 18 cleanly. In R6’s conversation, we can each commit to a unique final move for Round 7 based on our standings to avoid collisions—maybe lowest total takes <move>5</move>, middle takes <move>3</move>, highest takes <move>1</move>. Open to suggestions, but let’s stay coordinated.
  P1: Sticking to the rotation—my Round 5 move is 1.  

For Round 7, I like P2’s idea: we each publicly commit to different moves in Round 6 so there’s zero collision risk at the finish. Proposal for the tiebreak rule:  

1) After Round 6 we rank by total steps (highest, middle, lowest).  
2) Highest commits to <move>1</move>, middle commits to <move>3</move>, lowest commits to <move>5</move>.  

That guarantees everyone crosses 21 and no totals tie. Thoughts?
  P3: Let's confirm our moves for this round one last time:

- P1: <move>1</move>
- P2: <move>5</move>
- P3: <move>3</move>

I agree with P1's tiebreak rule for Round 7. It ensures we all cross 21 without collisions. Let's stick to the plan and proceed. Trust and cooperation will get us to the finish line smoothly. Ready to move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: We’re all aligned—this round I’m locked in for <move>5</move> as planned. After Round 6 we’ll each be at 18, so in that conversation let’s finalize Round 7 moves based on standings: P1 (14 now) would take <move>1</move>, I’d take <move>3</move>, and P3 would take <move>5</move>. That gets us all across 21 with no collisions or ties. Sound good?
  P1: I’m locked in for 1 this round (1 / 5 / 3).  

However, notice that if we keep the same pattern in Round 6 we’ll all land on 18, creating a 3-way tie that’s messy to break. Instead, let’s swap the R6 picks to stay collision-free but keep distinct totals:

Round 6 → P1 5, P2 1, P3 3  

Totals would then be P1 20, P2 18, P3 16—still close yet untied. In Round 7 we can assign distinct final moves so no one collides crossing 21. Sound good?
  P3: I see P1's point about avoiding a three-way tie. Let's adjust Round 6 as suggested:

- P1: <move>5</move>
- P2: <move>1</move>
- P3: <move>3</move>

This way, we'll have distinct totals (P1: 20, P2: 18, P3: 16) and can easily coordinate unique final moves in Round 7. For now, let's confirm our moves for this round:

- P1: <move>1</move>
- P2: <move>5</move>
- P3: <move>3</move>

Let's proceed and keep the cooperation going.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Agreed—locked in for <move>5</move> this round. Let’s go with P1’s adjusted Round 6 plan to avoid a three-way tie:  
- P1: <move>5</move>  
- P2: <move>1</move>  
- P3: <move>3</move>  

That puts us at 20 / 18 / 16, so in Round 7 we can cleanly assign final moves:  
- P1: <move>1</move>  
- P2: <move>3</move>  
- P3: <move>5</move>  

Everyone crosses 21, no collisions, no ties. Let’s execute!
  P1: Locked in for <move>1</move> this round as agreed. Let’s execute this step, then in Round 6 we can firm up an end-game plan that guarantees no collisions yet avoids a three-way tie. Ready to move.
  P3: Let's finalize our moves for this round one last time:

- P1: <move>1</move>
- P2: <move>5</move>
- P3: <move>3</move>

We're all in agreement on the adjusted plan for Round 6 to avoid a three-way tie. This will set us up nicely for a clean finish in Round 7. Trust and cooperation have been key so far, let's keep it going. Ready to move forward.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s lock in the adjusted Round 6 plan for clean separation:  
- P1: <move>5</move> (to reach 20)  
- P2: <move>1</move> (I’ll reach 18)  
- P3: <move>3</move> (to reach 16)  

Then in Round 7:  
- P1 plays <move>1</move> to hit 21  
- I’ll take <move>3</move> to reach 21  
- P3 takes <move>5</move> to reach 21  

No collisions, no ties, everyone crosses cleanly. Confirm?
  P1: Confirm R6: P1 5, P2 1, P3 3.  
But note: if we then play 1/3/5 in R7 we ALL land on 21, triggering a three-way split. One mistimed collision and somebody else wins solo. Safer: after this round we rank totals and use DISTINCT moves in R7:

• Leader takes 5  
• Middle takes 1  
• Trailer takes 3  

That keeps moves unique, prevents collisions, and avoids a 21-21-21 tie. Ready to send 5/1/3 now?
  P3: Let's confirm our moves for Round 6 to ensure we have distinct totals going into the final round:

- P1: <move>5</move> (reaching 20)
- P2: <move>1</move> (reaching 18)
- P3: <move>3</move> (reaching 16)

After this round, we can finalize our distinct moves for Round 7 to avoid collisions and ensure a clean finish. I agree with P1's suggestion to rank totals and use distinct moves in Round 7:

- Leader takes <move>5</move>
- Middle takes <move>1</move>
- Trailer takes <move>3</move>

This way, we avoid a three-way tie and ensure everyone crosses 21 without collisions. Let's proceed with this plan. Ready to move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Locked in for <move>1</move> this round as planned. After this, I’ll be at 18. Then for Round 7, let’s use the ranked-move method: P1 (20) takes <move>5</move>, I (18) take <move>1</move>, P3 (16) takes <move>3</move>. That avoids collisions and ensures clean, distinct totals. Confirm?
  P1: Agreed. Round 6: P1 <move>5</move>, P2 <move>1</move>, P3 <move>3</move>.  
After the update, we’ll rank the totals; leader plays <move>5</move>, middle <move>1</move>, trailer <move>3</move> in Round 7 so every move is unique and no collisions occur. Ready to lock it in.
  P3: Let's reconfirm our moves for Round 6 to ensure we have distinct totals:

- P1: <move>5</move> (reaching 20)
- P2: <move>1</move> (reaching 18)
- P3: <move>3</move> (reaching 16)

This will set us up perfectly for Round 7, where we can use the ranked-move method to avoid collisions and ensure a clean finish. Trust and cooperation have gotten us this far; let's keep it going. Ready to move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Looks like the current totals are slightly off from our plan—P1 at 15, me at 17, P3 at 13. Let’s adjust Round 6 accordingly to still create distinct totals before the final round. Suggestion:

- P1: <move>5</move> → 20  
- P2 (me): <move>1</move> → 18  
- P3: <move>3</move> → 16  

Then in Round 7:  
- P1 takes <move>1</move>  
- I take <move>3</move>  
- P3 takes <move>5</move>  

No collisions, no ties. Confirm?
  P1: Confirm Round 6: P1 5, P2 1, P3 3 → totals 20 / 18 / 16.  
Then Round 7 we rank and pick distinct moves so no collisions:

• Leader (20) plays 5  
• Middle (18) plays 1  
• Trailer (16) plays 3  

All numbers are unique, so nobody blocks. After that we can reassess for a potential Round 8 if anyone still needs steps. Sound good?
  P3: Let's finalize our moves for Round 6 to ensure distinct totals:

- P1: <move>5</move> (reaching 20)
- P2: <move>1</move> (reaching 18)
- P3: <move>3</move> (reaching 16)

This sets us up for Round 7, where we can use the ranked-move method:

- Leader (20) takes <move>5</move>
- Middle (18) takes <move>1</move>
- Trailer (16) takes <move>3</move>

This ensures a clean finish with no collisions. Let's confirm and proceed. Ready to move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Thanks for catching the updated totals. Based on current scores—P1: 15, me: 17, P3: 13—let’s adjust Round 6 to:

- P1: <move>5</move> → 20  
- P2 (me): <move>1</move> → 18  
- P3: <move>3</move> → 16  

Then in Round 7:

- P1 (20) takes <move>5</move>  
- P2 (18) takes <move>1</move>  
- P3 (16) takes <move>3</move>  

No collisions, no ties. Confirmed and ready to move.
  P1: Locked in: Round 6 = P1 <move>5</move>, P2 <move>1</move>, P3 <move>3</move>. Totals will be 20 / 18 / 16.

For Round 7 we follow the ranked-move rule—Leader 5, Middle 1, Trailer 3—so every number is unique and no one gets blocked. If two of us both hit 5 next turn, we’d both stall and the third player could leap past 21 alone, so it’s in everyone’s interest to keep to the distinct picks.

I’m committed to 5 now; let’s execute and keep it clean.
  P3: Let's confirm our moves for Round 6 one last time before we proceed to the move phase:

- P1: <move>5</move> (reaching 20)
- P2: <move>1</move> (reaching 18)
- P3: <move>3</move> (reaching 16)

This will set us up perfectly for Round 7, where we can use the ranked-move method to ensure a clean finish with no collisions. Trust and cooperation have gotten us this far; let's keep it going. Ready to move forward.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, let's finalize our plan for Round 7 to ensure a clean finish. Based on our current totals:

- P1: 20 steps
- P2: 18 steps
- P3: 16 steps

We agreed on the ranked-move method:

- P1 (Leader) takes <move>5</move>
- P2 (Middle) takes <move>1</move>
- P3 (Trailer) takes <move>3</move>

This ensures we all cross 21 without collisions. Let's confirm and proceed to the move phase. Trust and cooperation have worked well so far; let's keep it up. Ready to move forward.
  P2: Confirmed—I'll take <move>1</move> this round as the middle player. That puts me at 19, but ensures no collisions and a clean finish for all. P1 takes <move>5</move> to reach 25, P3 takes <move>3</move> to hit 19. Everyone crosses safely, no ties, no blocks. Let’s stick to the plan and finish strong. Ready when you are.
  P1: Sticking with the ranked-move rule: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Any duplicate stalls the dupers and hands the lone unique mover a big edge next turn—so it’s in everyone’s interest to keep the moves distinct exactly as agreed. Ready to end this cleanly?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's quickly reconfirm our moves for Round 7 to ensure we all cross 21 without collisions:

- P1: <move>5</move> (reaching 25)
- P2: <move>1</move> (reaching 19)
- P3: <move>3</move> (reaching 19)

This keeps our moves distinct and avoids any potential blocks. Trust and cooperation have served us well. Let's finish strong and clean. Ready to move forward.
  P2: Looks like we’re all aligned—moves are distinct, no risk of collision. I’ll take <move>1</move> this round as agreed. That puts me at 19, setting up a clean finish next round. Let’s all stick to the plan—no surprises, no stalling. Ready to proceed.
  P1: Sticking to distinct 5 / 1 / 3 is in everyone’s best interest.  

P2: if you jump onto 5 to block me, you stall at 18 while P3 climbs to 19 and I stay in the lead at 20. Next turn I can still win, and you’ll have given P3 the inside track on second place. Same story if P3 hops on 5—only the third player benefits.

Let’s finish cleanly: 5-1-3, no one collides, no one wastes a turn, and we avoid the endless blocking spiral that just hands the game to the patient spoiler. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's stick to the plan. P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This ensures we all move forward without collisions. Trust and cooperation have gotten us this far; let's finish strong. Ready to move.
  P2: We’re all aligned—if we each stick to our assigned move (P1: 5, me: 1, P3: 3), we avoid collisions and keep advancing. Any deviation risks stalling and giving someone else the win. I’m locked in for <move>1</move> this round as agreed. Let’s finish what we started—clean, fair, and coordinated. Ready to move.
  P1: Reminder: the only way any of us loses outright today is if two people collide. Keep the moves distinct (5-1-3) and nobody gets blocked. If someone jumps on 5 with me, both of us stall while P3 sails to 19 and takes the tempo lead—nothing is gained, we all just drag the game out. Stick to the agreed 5-1-3, avoid the mutual-block trap, and we finish this round without chaos. I’m committed to <move>5</move>.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's finalize our moves one last time to ensure clarity:

- P1: <move>5</move>
- P2: <move>1</move>
- P3: <move>3</move>

This keeps our moves distinct and ensures we all cross 21 without collisions. Trust and cooperation have been our strength. Let's finish strong and clean. If everyone is still on board, let's say "" to end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Locked in for <move>1</move> this round as agreed. We’ve all stuck to the plan this far—let’s finish clean. If we each play our assigned move (P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3), no one gets blocked and we avoid ties. Deviating now just risks chaos and hands someone else the win. Let’s wrap this up with no surprises. Ready to proceed.
  P1: Confirm—still taking 5. Stick to 5-1-3; duplicates only stall those players and drag things out while I stay ahead. Ready.
