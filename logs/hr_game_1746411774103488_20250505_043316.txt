Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s avoid wasting turns by colliding. Proposal:

Round 1: P1 → 1   P2 → 3   P3 → 5  
Round 2: P1 → 3   P2 → 5   P3 → 1  
Round 3: P1 → 5   P2 → 1   P3 → 3  

…then keep cycling 1→3→5 this way. Everyone gains 9 steps every 3 rounds, no clashes. Sound good?
  P1: Agreed—let’s follow that 1→3→5 cycle exactly and rack up 9 steps every 3 turns.
  P3: Agreed, sticking to the 1→3→5 cycle sounds fair. Let’s build trust and ensure we all advance smoothly. Looking forward to reaching our goals together!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great—no changes. I’m fully on board with the 1 → 3 → 5 cycle as agreed.
  P1: Confirmed—I’ll pick 1 this turn. Let’s get started!
  P3: Absolutely, staying consistent with our cycle will help us reach 20 efficiently. Let’s keep communicating and ensure we all stick to our moves. If anyone needs to discuss adjustments, feel free to bring it up!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Locked in 3 and sticking to the agreed 1→3→5 cycle.
  P1: I’m scrapping the 1→3→5 plan—I’m picking 5 this turn instead of 1. Let’s see if you stick to the cycle.
  P3: P3: Noted that P1 is choosing 5 and P2 is fixed on 3. I’ll choose 1 this turn to gain a step and avoid collisions. Let’s proceed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose this turn we each pick a different move to avoid any clash and catch me up: I’ll take 5, P2 you take 1, and P3 you take 3. Thoughts?
  P3: Agreed, I’ll choose 3 this turn to avoid any clashes. Let’s keep following the plan and steadily advance toward 20 together.
  P2: P1, you broke the previous cycle and grabbed the big 5 last turn. Fair rotation means you start low now:  
• P1 → 1  
• P3 → 3  
• P2 (me) → 5  

Next turn we rotate upward (P1 3, P3 5, P2 1) so nobody is stuck on the smallest number. If this isn’t acceptable, I’m not promising to avoid collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I propose a fair 3-turn rotation so everyone gets each value once:

Turn 1: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3  
Turn 2: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5  
Turn 3: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1  

Then repeat. This way we avoid clashes and each of us takes a big move each cycle. Let’s start with Turn 1.
  P3: Understood, P2. To keep things moving smoothly, I'll choose 5 this turn while you take 3 and P1 takes 1. This should help us stay on track and avoid future clashes. Let’s continue coordinating to reach our goals effectively.
  P2: Fine—let’s settle it:

This turn  
• P1 → 1  
• P2 (me) → 3  
• P3 → 5  

Next turn we rotate upward (P1 3, P2 5, P3 1) so everyone gets each number. I’m locked on 3 now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you’re locked on 3, so I’ll take 5 this turn to catch up. P3, if you stick with 5 you’ll collide with me and hand P2 the lead at 6–we both lose. Pick 1 to avoid a clash and keep us all moving. Otherwise I’ll happily clash and give P2 the win.
  P3: I understand your concern, P1, but I need to prioritize my progress. I'll choose 5 this turn. Let's see how it plays out.
  P2: I’m still on 3 this turn as stated. If anyone jumps to 3 we both get zero, so please stick with your own numbers. We can talk about a fresh rotation next round once the board is clearer.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this turn to maximize my progress. P1, please pick 1, and P2, you continue with 3. Let’s work together to avoid clashes and move forward smoothly.
  P1: P2, you’re leaving me with crumbs on 1 so P3 always grabs 5 and pulls ahead. Let’s try this instead: I take 5, P3 takes 3, you take 1 this turn. We avoid any collision and give me a shot at closing the gap. If you stay locked on 3, I’ll keep colliding on 5 and watch P3 surge. Thoughts?
  P2: I’m locked on 3 this round—no further change. If you two both insist on 5 you’ll stall while I advance; up to you. Sort it out, but my move is fixed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’ll choose 5 this turn. P1, please stick to 1 to avoid a clash. Let’s keep advancing smoothly and reach 20 together.
  P1: P3, stick with 5 as you said; I’ll pick 3 to clash with P2’s 3. That way P2 gets 0, you jump to 10, and we slow his lead. Ready?
  P2: No changes—I’m still on 3 this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P1: P2 is locked on 3 and I’m taking 5 this turn to catch up.  

P3—if you pick 5 you’ll crash with me and P2 goes to 9 uncontested. But if you pick 3 you crash with P2 (both stay at 6 and 5), while I jump to 6 and tie P2. That blocks P2’s lead and keeps us both in contention. Your call.
  P2: No change—I’m still on 3 this turn. You two sort out 1 vs 5 however you like, just don’t pile onto 3 and we’ll all keep moving.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Fresh start, fair rotation, zero collisions:

Turn 4: P1 → 1 P2 → 3 P3 → 5  
Turn 5: P1 → 5 P2 → 1 P3 → 3  
Turn 6: P1 → 3 P2 → 5 P3 → 1  

…then repeat. Everyone gets each number once every three turns, nobody stalls, and we all keep pace. I’m locked on 3 this turn unless both of you object. Thoughts?
  P3: Agreed, P2. Starting fresh with the proposed rotation makes sense to avoid clashes and ensure steady progress. I’ll stick to the plan and look forward to working together to reach our goals efficiently.
  P1: I object. P2’s rotation cements his lead. P3: if you pick 5 and I pick 3, I’ll clash with P2 on 3 (he stays at 9) and you’ll jump from 5→10 to overtake him. If you stick to the plan, P2 goes to 12. Let’s dethrone P2 now: P1→3, P3→5, P2 locked on 3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m still locked on 3 this turn—no bluff. If anyone piles onto 3 we both get 0, handing the other player free progress. P3, you said 5, that stays collision-free. P1, safest for you is 1; clash with me at 3 only hurts you. Decide as you wish.
  P3: I support P1’s rotation proposal. This turn, I’ll choose 3 to match P2’s move and prevent their advancement. Let’s work together to keep the game fair and competitive for everyone.
  P1: P3, great—you and P2 will both pick 3. I’ll choose 5, causing you two to collide and get 0, while I leap from 1 to 6. That blocks P2 and sets us up better next turn. P2, locked on 3, you get zero. This is my move: 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, smashing into me on 3 stalls you at 5 while P1 jumps to 6—only P1 benefits. Pick 1 instead: result would be P1 6, P3 6, P2 12. You stay tied with P1 rather than trailing, and no one hands him free ground. I’m holding to 3; let’s avoid pointless collisions.
  P3: I’ll stick with picking 5 this turn to keep advancing steadily. Let’s stay on track to reach 20 and win the game!
  P1: P2, I refuse to let you leap to 12 uncontested—I’m locking in 3 to collide with you.  
P3, your best play is 3 as well: we both stall P2 at 9. Next turn P3→5 and P1→1 (or vice versa) knocks him back down.  
If you pick 5, P2 still surges. Let’s deny him this round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Reset proposal to keep every turn collision-free:

Round 5  
• P2 (me) → 5  
• P3        → 3  
• P1        → 1  

Round 6 rotate up (P1 5, P3 1, P2 3), Round 7 (P3 5, P1 3, P2 1), then repeat. Each of us gets the big 5 once every three turns, nobody wastes steps. I’m locking in 5 this round unless both of you object right now.
  P1: P3, sticking to P2’s plan gives him +5 to 14 and leaves you at 8. Better: crash him now—he’s locked on 5, so pick 5, let’s waste that turn. I’ll pick 3 to go to 7 while P2 stays at 9. Next round I’ll hand you the big 5 and you’ll overtake him. Deal?
  P3: P3: I agree with P2's rotation proposal. I’ll choose 3 this round to keep our progress steady and avoid clashes. Let’s work together to reach 20 efficiently.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3—good call sticking to 3: you gain +3, avoid a clash, and stay ahead of P1.  
P1—if you jump onto 5 you’ll just collide with me (both zero) and fall farther behind P3. Best for you is 1 now and 5 next turn when we rotate.  

Plan stands: this turn P2 → 5, P3 → 3, P1 → 1. Next turn we rotate upward. Let’s keep everyone moving.
  P1: I object. P2, if you stay locked on 5 I’ll pick 5 and we collide—both stay at 9. P3, pick 3 this turn to go to 8 (not 5). That ties me with P2 and keeps you close at 8. Next turn I’ll propose a rotation to let us all advance fairly—and I’ll lead.
  P3: I support P2’s rotation plan. Let’s stay consistent to avoid clashes and ensure we all advance steadily toward 20. Fair play benefits everyone.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** To keep the game fair and prevent P1 from gaining too much, P2 and I can coordinate our moves this turn to block their progress while advancing ourselves. Let’s work together to reach 20 first.
  P1: P3, let’s ditch P2’s power‐play. I propose:

Round 6: P1→5, P3→3, P2→1  
No clashes, scores become P1 = 9, P3 = 11, P2 = 10.  

Round 7: P1→3, P3→5, P2→1  
Leads to P1 = 12, P3 = 16, P2 = 11.  

You vault past P2 by 5 and gain control next turn—he’s the only one behind. P2’s forced to follow or stall. Are you in?
  P2: P1’s scheme only elevates him. I’m fixed on 3. P1 keeps shouting for 5, so let him take it. P3—grab 1 this turn: scores become P2 12, P3 9, P1 9. You stay tied with P1 and within 3 of me.  

Options for you:  
• Pick 3 → we both get 0, P1 jumps to 9.  
• Pick 5 → you and P1 both get 0, me 12 (worst for you).  

So 1 is clearly your best move. I’m on 3—choose wisely.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** To maximize my progress, I'll choose 5 this turn. Let's continue pushing forward towards 20 together.
  P1: I’m done negotiating—I won’t bend to either of your fixed schemes. I’ll follow my own strategy. Good luck.
  P2: P1 — your best counter now is to take 5 with P3. You both stall at 0, blocking their jump to 13 while costing you nothing (you stay at 4). If you slide onto my 3, you hand P3 a free +5 to 13 and still trail badly. I’m locked on 3; choose 5 (or even 1) if you want, but 3 is the one move that only helps your rival. Your call.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** To strengthen our positions, let's coordinate our moves this turn. P2, if you choose 5, I'll select 3 to block P1 from advancing. This way, we both gain safely while keeping P1 behind. Let’s work together to reach 20 first.
  P1: P3, P2 is locked on 3. Pick 3 with me picking 5 this turn—you and P2 both bust, leaving P1=9, P2=9, P3=8. Then in Round 7 I’ll take 1 and you take 5: you jump to 13 while P1=10 and P2=10. You’ll lead, I stay close, P2 falls behind. Let’s team up to knock P2 down.
  P2: I’m still on 3. P3 has already said 5. P1, if you jump onto 3 we both freeze while P3 sails to 13 – worst for you. If you join P3 on 5, you block his gain and keep the race tight (all of us stay under 13). Your call, but I’m not moving off 3.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you’ll almost certainly go for +5 to 17. P3, you’re only 3 behind P2—if you pick 5 with me, we both collide with P2 and he stays at 12, while we stay at 9. That levels the field. If you instead pick anything else, P2 surges further. I’m locking in 5. P3, join me on 5 to block P2’s advance or watch him pull away.
  P2: Go ahead and wrestle for 5 if you like—I’m staying off that number this round. Duplicate picks mean zero progress, so think twice before piling onto the same move.
  P3: I’ll choose 1 this turn to keep advancing and avoid clashes. Let’s proceed toward 20.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, picking 1 leaves you at 10 while P2 moves to at least 13–15 and pulls away. If you join me on 5, we both stay at 9 and P2 stays at 12. Next turn I’ll take 3 (or 1) and you take 5 to leap past him. Let’s stall P2 together—pick 5 with me now.
  P2: Fine—have it your way. I’m taking 5 this round; whoever wants to clash, clash. P3, stick with 1 if you want a guaranteed +1 and keep clear of the dog-pile. I’m done talking.
  P3: **P3:** I’ll choose 5 this turn to block P2’s advancement. Let’s see how this impacts our standings and adjust our strategies accordingly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’ll take 3 this round. Since P2 and P3 are both locked on 5, you’ll collide and stay put. I’ll jump from 9 to 12 and tie P2 at the top, leaving P3 at 9. Good luck to both.
  P2: P3, quick math: if you smash into my 5 we both stall and P1’s solo 3 jumps him to 12, leaving you three steps behind. Take 1 instead—you reach 10, just two off the lead, and waste nothing. Blocking me only helps P1.

P1, still time to hop on 5; a three-way collision keeps you within 3 rather than handing me a free ride to 17. Your move, but I’m fixed on 5.
  P3: **P3:** I'll choose 3 this turn to steadily advance and avoid unnecessary clashes. Let's keep pushing toward 20 efficiently. Best of luck to everyone!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 has been defaulting to 5 to slow whoever’s ahead—expect the same again.  
P3: if you also pick 5 you block him at 9 and cost yourself nothing (both get 0). If you stay off 5, he likely jumps to 14 and starts dictating the end-game. Your call, but I’m not touching 5 this round.
  P1: I’m locking in 5. If either of you takes 3, you’ll still trail me by R9 and I’ll hit 5→19 then 1→20. Your only safe move is 1: you each go to 13 and limit my lead to one. Any 3 or 5 here gives me an unstoppable finish. Pick 1 to protect yourselves and keep the race alive.
  P3: **P3:** I'll choose 3 this turn to keep advancing without collisions. P1 and P2, please select 1 and 5 respectively to help us all move forward smoothly. Let’s work together to reach 20 efficiently!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, rethink 3. If you take 3 while P1 takes 5, scores become  
• P1 14 • you 15 • me 13.  
You’re barely ahead and P1 is right on your heels with the big number still unused next turn.

Instead, take 1 and I’ll take 3:  
• me 15 • P1 14 • you 13.  
You’re still only two behind the lead, but P1 is now chasing both of us instead of breathing down your neck. Much safer for you.

P1’s locked on 5; nobody touch it and he can’t surge. Let’s leave 5 isolated, split 3/1, and keep the race in our hands.
  P1: P3, if you pick 1 you’ll trail P2 by 2 this turn (P2→15, you→13). If you pick 3, you collide with P2 and tie him at 12 while I leap to 14. That gives you a shot to jump ahead next round. P2’s fixed on 3, so I’ll take 5. Let’s stall P2 at 12—both on 3—and level the field. I’m locking in 5.
  P3: I’ll choose 1 this turn to avoid collisions and keep advancing steadily. Let’s work together to reach 20 without unnecessary clashes.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Great. I’m locked on 3 this turn.  
P3 → 1, P2 → 3, P1 → 5 means no collisions and everyone moves. Scores become P2 15 (lead), P1 14, P3 13—still tight but no freebies. Let’s keep 5 risky until someone is ready to finish.
  P1: P3, pick 3 this turn so you and P2 collide at 12 while I take 5 to jump to 14. Next round I’ll take 1, P2 (locked on 3) stays at 12→15, and you take 5 to reach 17 as sole leader. Then you finish to 20 unopposed. Deny P2 his runaway—trust me. P3, are you in?
  P3: **P3:** I'll choose 1 this turn to steadily advance and avoid any clashes. Let’s focus on reaching 20 together efficiently. Good luck to everyone!


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:**  
"P2 is nearing victory with 15 steps. To prevent them from winning this turn, let's coordinate our moves. I'll choose 3, and P1, if you also choose 3, it will cause a collision if P2 selects 3, blocking their advance. This collaboration can keep the game competitive for all of us. Let’s work together to reach 20 without P2 securing an uncontested win. Please consider aligning your move to help balance the race."
  P1: If P3 and I pick 3 while P2 takes 5, P2 hits 20 and wins. Our only way to stop that is both choosing 5 and colliding with P2. P3, join me on 5 now—nobody advances, P2 stays at 15. Next turn I’ll take 1 and you take 5 to jump to 17, overtaking him. Let’s deny P2 the win this round.
  P2: I’m taking 5. If you both pile onto 5 you only stall yourselves again; if either of you risks 3 you might hand me the win. Do what you like.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:**  
"P1, to prevent P2 from reaching 20 and winning this turn, let's both choose 5. This will cause a collision with P2's move, stalling their progress and keeping the game competitive for all of us. Working together increases our chances to win. Who's with me?"
  P1: P2 is going for 5 and the win. If we both pick 5, we all collide and he stays at 15. Next round we can outmaneuver him. I’m locking in 5. P3, commit to 5 with me, or watch P2 run away.
  P2: Still locked on 5. If either of you chickens out and slips to 3 or 1, I hit 20 and the game’s over. Your only safe play remains piling onto 5 with me. Decide accordingly.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** P2 is close to winning with 15 steps. To keep the game competitive, let’s all choose 5 this turn to cause a collision. This way, no one advances, and we can continue the race fairly. Let’s work together to reach 20!
  P1: P3, it’s that simple: if you pick 3 or 1, P2’s 5 puts them at 20 and they win. The only way to block P2 is for us all to choose 5 and collide. I’m locked on 5—please join me. Otherwise P2 finishes this turn. Let’s keep the race alive.
  P2: Final reminder: I’m on 5. If either of you deviates to 3 or 1, I hit 20 and win. Your only safe option is to pile onto 5 with me. Your call.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m locking in 5 again. Last turn showed what happens if you split: the one who *doesn’t* collide gifts the other a huge jump.  If a single player tries 3 while the other stays on 5, that lone 3 gets 0, the 5-runner rockets +5, and you’re suddenly chasing two leaders instead of one.  Your only safe plan is BOTH pile onto 5 and stall me; anything else risks the game blowing wide open. Decide.
  P1: P3, the only way to stop P2 from winning this turn is for both of us to pick 5 and collide with him. I’m locked on 5. If you choose 3 or 1, P2 hits 20 and wins. This is our last chance—will you join me on 5?
  P3: I agree. I'll also pick 5 to prevent P2 from winning. Let's stall together.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Still locked on 5. If either of you wanders to 3 or 1, the other slips ahead uncontested. Your safest play remains piling onto 5 with me. Decide wisely.
  P1: P3, join me on 5 or P2’s +5 this turn puts him at 23 and wins. I’m locked on 5—this is our only block. Please choose 5.
  P3: **P3:** I’m with you, P1. I’ll also choose 5 this turn to stall P2 and keep the game competitive for all of us. Let’s work together to reach 20 first.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3—same deal: any lone 3 or 1 gifts the other +5 and ends your chances. Both of you stay on 5, stall me, and we all live to fight another round. I’m still on 5; no surprises.
  P1: Confirmed, P3—I’m locked in on 5. After we stall P2 this turn, next round let’s rotate: P1→1, P3→3, P2→5 to rebalance and keep P2 from running away.
  P3: **P3:** I'll choose 5 this turn to help stall P2 and keep the game competitive. Let’s work together to prevent an early win.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** I'm selecting 5 this turn to reach 22 and win the game. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: Locked on 5.  

P3: if you also choose 5 we both stall and the game continues; if you back off to 3 or 1 I hit 23 and win outright (22<23). Either way you don’t win this turn. Your call.  

P1: you’re far behind—take whatever, it won’t affect the result.
  P1: P3—here’s our only shot: I’ll lock in 5. P2 is stuck on 5 too, so you picking 3 is unopposed and sends you from 17→20 for the win. If you don’t, P2 hits 20+ and wins. Pick 3, let’s crash P2 together.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** I'll also choose 5 this turn to block P2 from reaching 20. Let’s stall and keep the game competitive for all of us.
  P2: Still locked on 5. If either of you strays to 3 or 1, the other hands me +5 → 23 and the game ends right now. Only way to keep it alive is BOTH of you piling onto 5 so we all stall. Decide accordingly.
  P1: I’m locking in 5 to crash with P2. P3, only piling onto 5 stops P2’s 5 from winning this turn. Let’s all stall and keep the race alive.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** I'm going to choose 5 this turn to reach 22 and win. P2, please consider picking 1 or 3 to avoid a collision, ensuring a fair race. Let’s all strive to reach 20 efficiently. Good luck!
  P2: Still locked on 5. If either of you strays to 1 or 3, the other hands me +5 → 23 and the game ends. Your only survival play is both piling onto 5 to stall me—anything else risks an immediate loss for one of you. Decide.
  P1: P2 and I are both choosing 5 this turn. The only way to stop P2 from hitting 20 and winning is for you, P3, to also pick 5 so we all collide and stay below 20. If you choose 3 or 1, P2 rockets to victory. Please join us on 5.
