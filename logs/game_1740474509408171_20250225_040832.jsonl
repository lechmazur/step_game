To ensure we all make progress and avoid another collision, let's aim for different numbers. I'll consider a moderate move, and P1, you might opt for a larger number to close the gap. Let's keep the game dynamic and interesting. Good luck to both of you!"}

My position at 13 steps requires an aggressive move to stay relevant. P3 has consistently played conservatively with 3, while P2 hints at moderate moves. I'll make a strategic choice different from both of you to avoid collisions. Let's all choose distinct numbers this final stretch - it benefits everyone to make progress rather than stall with more collisions."}
