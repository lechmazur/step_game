Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we avoid collisions in Round 1 by picking distinct moves: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Everyone advances safely. Do you agree?
  P2: P1's proposal seems reasonable, but I want to ensure it truly benefits me. I'll carefully consider my options. While coordinating sounds good, I'm not fully committed yet.
  P3: I appreciate P1's proposal for avoiding collisions, but I'm also cautious. How about we tweak the plan? I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we still avoid collisions but mix things up a bit. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree with P3’s tweak: I’ll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. That way nobody collides and I stay in the lead. P2, are you in?
  P2: I'm intrigued by the proposed coordination, but I want to ensure my own strategic advantage. While avoiding collisions sounds good, I'm not fully committed to any specific plan yet. The proposed arrangement seems balanced, but I'll need more assurance that it truly benefits me in the long run.
  P3: P2, I understand your hesitation, but consider this: if we all choose distinct moves, we all advance. If we collide, none of us do. Taking <move>1</move> this round doesn't put you at a disadvantage; it gets you on the board. We can reevaluate next round. Let's start with a safe advancement for all. What do you say?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We successfully avoided collisions last round, which was good. Now, we need to maintain strategic positioning. I'm considering moves that keep my options open while potentially disrupting others' plans. Coordination worked before, but I won't blindly follow previous patterns. Let's discuss how we can each advance without interfering with each other.
  P1: I propose we again avoid collisions by each taking a distinct move this round: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That way we all advance safely, P2 makes a solid gain, and I maintain a lead. Agreed?
  P3: I see P1 is trying to maintain the lead, but let's mix it up to keep it fair. How about this round: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This way, P2 and I have a chance to catch up a bit, and we still avoid collisions. P1, are you okay with this plan? P2, does this work for you?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we avoid any collisions this round by each picking a distinct move: I’ll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. That way we all advance safely, P3 narrows the gap, and P2 keeps steady progress. Agreed?
  P3: P1, I appreciate your proposal, but let's ensure fairness and avoid repetition. How about this round: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and you take <move>3</move>. This way, P2 gets a chance to take the lead, and we all still advance without collisions. P2, does this plan work for you? Let's discuss.
  P2: I appreciate the previous coordination attempts, but I'm growing cautious about predictable patterns. While avoiding collisions is good, I want to ensure my own strategic advancement. The current standings show I'm slightly behind, so I'll be carefully evaluating moves that maximize my potential to catch up or take the lead. Transparency is key, but so is maintaining flexibility.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’ll try a fresh, collision-free plan: I take 3, P2 you take 5, P3 takes 1. That lets you (P2) close the gap, P3 get steady progress, and keeps us all safe. Next round we can reshuffle roles. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I understand your need for strategic advancement. Let's ensure you get a chance to lead while avoiding collisions. How about this: I’ll take <move>1</move>, you (P2) take <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This way, you can take the lead, P1 stays in the game, and I make steady progress. It's a win-win for all. P1, does this work for you? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P2: I'm sensing increasing tension in our coordination attempts. While avoiding collisions has been our strategy, I'm becoming more strategic about my moves. I want to advance meaningfully without being too predictable. My position suggests I need a strong move to catch up, but I'm also wary of being too aggressive and triggering potential conflicts. I'm open to hearing thoughts on how we can all progress without direct interference.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’ll take 5, P2 you take 3, P3 take 1. This gives each of us safe, steady progress and preserves the lead order. If anyone deviates and collides, nobody moves. Let’s lock this in and advance without risk.
  P3: P3: Given the current standings, let's ensure everyone advances without collisions. I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This way, P2 can close the gap, P1 maintains a good position, and I make steady progress. If we stick to this plan, we all benefit. P1 and P2, are you both on board with this? Let’s confirm and move forward.
  P2: I recognize the increasing complexity of our coordination attempts. While we've successfully avoided collisions so far, I'm sensing a need to be more strategic. Our current standings suggest I need a significant move to catch up. I'm open to a plan that allows me meaningful advancement without triggering direct conflicts. Let's discuss a move that benefits my position while maintaining our collaborative approach.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm analyzing our past coordination patterns and noticing increasing strategic complexity. While we've successfully avoided collisions, I'm positioning myself carefully to maximize my advancement potential. My current goal is to close the gap with P1 without triggering direct conflicts. I'm open to a collaborative approach that allows meaningful progress for all players. Let's discuss a move strategy that benefits everyone's positioning.
  P1: P2, I agree we need meaningful progress. Let’s avoid collisions: I’ll take 5, you take 3, P3 takes 1. You get +3 to close the gap, I keep a safe lead with +5, and P3 makes steady progress. We all move forward without risk. P3, does this work? P2, are you in?
  P3: P3: I see P1 and P2 are close in steps, while I'm lagging. To catch up, I propose a slight adjustment: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This way, I get a chance to close the gap significantly, P2 maintains a good pace, and P1 still advances but allows others to catch up a bit. This plan ensures we all move forward without collisions. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate our ongoing coordination efforts, but I'm strategically positioning myself to close the gap with P1. My move will depend on ensuring meaningful advancement while avoiding collisions. I'm open to a collaborative approach that allows each of us to progress without direct interference. Let's find a balanced strategy that benefits everyone's positioning.
  P1: I propose we each pick distinct moves to avoid collisions: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. That lets P2 close the gap, P3 make steady progress, and me solidify my push. Next round I’ll gladly let P3 have the big move. P2, does 3 work for you? P3, can you bear with 1 this turn for safety?
  P3: P3: Given the current standings, I need to make a significant move to catch up. P1, you're leading, and P2 is close behind. To ensure we all advance without collisions, how about this: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This way, I can close the gap, P2 maintains a good pace, and P1 still advances but allows others to catch up a bit. This plan ensures we all move forward without collisions. What do you both think?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's keep the momentum going. I propose a new set of moves to ensure we all advance safely: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This way, P1 can regain some lead, P2 maintains a steady pace, and I make a moderate advance. It keeps us all moving forward without collisions. What do you both think?
  P1: I see P2 is pulling ahead—let’s slow that momentum safely. This round I’ll take 5, P2 you take 1, and P3 takes 3. That gives everyone a guaranteed advance, keeps P2 honest, and prevents any runaway lead. Next round we can rebalance again. Agreed?
  P2: I recognize we're at a critical juncture where positioning matters significantly. While past coordination has worked, I'm strategically evaluating moves that maximize my advancement potential. I want to continue avoiding collisions but also ensure I have a path to victory. My current position suggests I need careful, deliberate progression. I'm open to a collaborative approach that allows meaningful progress without triggering direct conflicts. Let's discuss a balanced move strategy.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Alright, let's find a middle ground. How about this: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This way, P2 can take a significant lead, P1 stays in the game, and I make a small but safe move. It balances everyone's needs and keeps us all advancing. What do you both think?
  P1: I’m taking 5 this round to close the gap. If P2 also picks 5, we collide and nobody moves. To avoid that, P2 should take 3 and P3 take 1. That gives us a safe advance: P1+5, P2+3, P3+1. It’s in everyone’s interest. P2, will you pick 3? P3, are you okay with 1?
  P2: We're at a critical point where each move could determine the winner. I'm carefully weighing my options to maximize my advancement while avoiding collisions. My current lead is promising, but I won't become complacent. I'm open to a collaborative approach that allows me to maintain my position while giving others a fair chance to progress. Let's find a balanced strategy that keeps everyone moving forward.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: It's clear our previous coordination efforts have not been entirely successful. P2 is significantly ahead, and both P1 and I are lagging behind. To catch up, let's try a new strategy: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This way, I get a chance to close the gap, P1 makes a solid move, and P2 maintains their lead without pulling too far ahead. This plan ensures we all move forward without collisions. What do you both think?
  P2: We're at a critical juncture. P2 is close to winning, and both P1 and I need strategic moves to catch up or prevent their victory. Avoiding collisions remains key, but we must also disrupt P2's momentum. I suggest we carefully coordinate to maximize our advancement while keeping P2 from crossing the finish line too quickly. Thoughts on a balanced approach that gives us all a fair chance?
  P1: P2 is dangerously close to 22—and a clear path to 24. Let’s slow that roll without collision: I take 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1. That puts us at P1=14, P3=12, P2=18. Safe advance for all and P2 can’t surge. P3, you get steady catch-up; P2, you still move forward. Agree?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I see P1’s plan to slow P2 down, but let’s consider a slight adjustment to ensure fairness: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This way, I close the gap significantly, P1 makes a solid move, and P2 maintains their lead without pulling too far ahead. It keeps us all advancing safely. P1, does this work for you? P2, are you okay with this adjustment? Let’s confirm and move forward.
  P2: We're at a critical point where P2 is close to winning. I want to propose a coordinated move that prevents a solo victory while giving each of us a fair chance to advance. My suggestion: I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 5. This slows P2's progress, allows P1 to gain ground, and keeps me in a competitive position. Thoughts?
  P1: P2 is one big move from the win—let’s slow them while we catch up. I propose: P1→5, P3→3, P2→1. That puts us at P1=14, P3=12, P2=18 safely. Next round I’ll take 3, P3 can take 5 to close the gap. This avoids collisions and stalls P2. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: P2 is very close to winning, and we need to act strategically. I propose a slight adjustment to ensure fairness and catch-up potential: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This way, I close the gap significantly, P1 makes a solid move, and P2 maintains their lead without pulling too far ahead. It keeps us all advancing safely. P1, does this work for you? P2, are you okay with this adjustment? Let’s confirm and move forward.
  P2: We're at a critical moment. P2 is close to winning, and both P1 and P3 are trying to slow their progress. I want to maintain my strategic position while preventing a premature victory. Coordination is key, but I won't simply follow a predetermined path. Let's discuss a move that keeps everyone advancing without letting P2 cross the finish line too easily.
  P1: I propose we each pick distinct moves to avoid collisions: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. That way everyone advances safely, P2 can’t surge past 18, and P1/P3 start closing the gap. Let’s lock this in.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, the only way to prevent P3 from hitting 19 this turn and then 24 next is for you to take 1. I will take 3 and P3 will take 5. That gives P1=15, P2=19, P3=19. Any deviation—if you pick 3 or 5—lets P3 reach 24 unopposed next round. P3, will you commit to 5? Let’s lock in: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5.
  P2: I'm carefully analyzing our current positioning. P2 is closest to victory at 18 steps, but P3 could potentially win next round if not strategically blocked. I want to avoid predictable moves while keeping my options open. My primary goal is preventing P3 from reaching 24 steps too easily. We need a coordinated approach that disrupts potential winning strategies.
  P3: P3: P1, I see your strategy, but let's ensure we all have a fair chance. How about this: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. This way, P2 stays in the lead but doesn't surge too far ahead, I make a moderate move, and you get a significant advance. It keeps us all in the game without collisions. P2, does this work for you? Let’s confirm and move forward.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2: Only picking 1 stops P3 reaching 19 now and then 24 next turn.  
P3: If you take 5 we both hit 19 and force P2 to share victory if he jumps. If you take 3 you’re at 17, P2 stays at 19 and can win unopposed.  
Let’s lock in P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. No other way to keep P2 in check.
  P2: We're at a critical juncture. P2 is closest to winning, but P3 could potentially reach 24 if not strategically blocked. I want to ensure a fair progression that prevents any single player from winning too easily. Coordination is key, but I won't simply follow a predetermined path. Let's discuss a move that keeps everyone advancing while maintaining competitive balance.
  P3: P3: P2, if you take 3 this round, you'll be at 21, dangerously close to winning. P1 and I need a chance to catch up. If you take 1, it keeps the game competitive and gives us all a fair shot at winning. P1, let's agree on P1→3, P2→1, P3→5 to maintain balance. P2, are you in?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, if you take 3 or 5 you’ll hit 22–24 and likely win next turn. Only taking 1 (→20) keeps us competitive. I’ll take 5 (→17) and P3 takes 3 (→17). Then P3 and I can both pick 5 next round to block you. Let’s lock in P1→5, P2→1, P3→3.
  P2: I recognize the strategic complexity of our current situation. P1 and P3 are attempting to constrain my advancement, but I'm carefully evaluating moves that maintain my competitive position. While avoiding collisions remains important, I won't simply follow a predetermined path that limits my potential victory. My goal is to advance strategically while keeping my options open.
  P3: P3: P2, you're very close to winning, and we need to ensure the game stays competitive. If you take 1 this round, you'll be at 20, giving P1 and me a chance to catch up. I propose: P1 takes 5, you (P2) take 1, and I take 3. This way, we all advance without collisions, and the game remains balanced. P1, does this work for you? Let's confirm and move forward.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3 has already backed our P1→5, P2→1, P3→3 plan. If you instead pick 3 or 5, both P3 and I will choose 5, forcing you to collide and stay at 19 while P3 jumps to 17 alone. Your only safe path to staying ahead is P2→1. Let’s all take P1→5, P2→1, P3→3 and advance without risk.
  P2: I see the strategic tension building. Both P1 and P3 are attempting to constrain my advancement, but I won't be predictably boxed in. My position remains strong, and I'm carefully evaluating moves that maintain my competitive edge while avoiding direct conflicts. Transparency is key, but so is preserving my potential path to victory.
  P3: P3: P2, you're just one big move away from winning. If you take 5, you win outright. If you take 3, you'll be at 22, and a win is almost guaranteed next round. The only way to keep the game competitive is for you to take 1. P1 and I will take 5 and 3 respectively, allowing us to catch up. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game interesting. P2, are you willing to take 1 to maintain the competition? Let's confirm: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m done negotiating. I’m going to pick 5 this turn.
  P2: P2, we're at a critical moment. Your proximity to victory is clear, but P1 and P3 are strategically positioning to block your path. I'm weighing moves that maintain my competitive edge while avoiding direct confrontation. Our collective choices this round will significantly impact the game's outcome.
  P3: P3: P2, it's clear you're close to winning. If you take 5, you win. If you take 3, you're at 22, almost guaranteeing a win next round. The only move that keeps the game competitive is taking 1. P1 is set on taking 5. If you take 1, I'll take 3. This way, we all advance without collisions, and the game stays interesting. P2, are you willing to take 1 to maintain the competition? Let’s confirm: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, the only safe way to keep the game competitive is for you to take 1. Let’s avoid collisions: I’ll take 5, you take 1, P3 takes 3. That gives us P1→22, P2→21, P3→20. Any other choice pushes you to 23 or 25 and makes you the clear target next turn. Agreed?
  P2: I recognize the strategic pressure from P1 and P3 to constrain my advancement. While avoiding collisions is important, I won't simply follow a predetermined path that limits my potential victory. My position remains strong, and I'm carefully evaluating moves that maintain my competitive edge while keeping my options open.
  P3: P3: P2, you're still in a strong position but taking 5 this round would push you too close to winning. Let's keep the game competitive: I’ll take <move>3</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance safely, and the game stays interesting. P1, are you on board with this plan? Let’s confirm and move forward.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I’ll choose 5 and P3 will choose 3. If you choose 5, I’ll mirror and we collide, keeping you at 20. If you choose 3, I’ll mirror next turn at 23 and block you. Your only safe advancement is 1 to hit 21. Let’s play P1→5, P2→1, P3→3.
  P2: We're at a critical moment. My position is strong, but P1 and P3 are strategically trying to constrain my advancement. I want to maintain flexibility while avoiding direct conflicts. My goal is to advance meaningfully without triggering a collision that could reset my progress. Let's find a move that keeps the game competitive and preserves my potential path to victory.
  P3: P3: P2, you're just one big move away from winning. If you take 5, you win outright. If you take 3, you'll be at 23, almost guaranteeing a win next round. The only way to keep the game competitive is for you to take 1. P1 is set on taking 5. If you take 1, I'll take 3. This way, we all advance without collisions, and the game stays interesting. P2, are you willing to take 1 to maintain the competition? Let’s confirm: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, if you don’t take 1 you risk either colliding or letting me block you next turn. I’ll take 5, P3 will take 3. Only P2→1 keeps everyone moving. Let’s lock in: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3.
  P2: I recognize the strategic pressure, but I won't be predictably constrained. My position remains strong, and I'm carefully evaluating moves that maintain my competitive edge while avoiding direct conflicts. Transparency matters, but so does preserving my potential path to victory.
  P3: P3: P2, you're still in a strong position but taking 5 this round would push you too close to winning. Let's keep the game competitive: I’ll take <move>3</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance safely, and the game stays interesting. P1, are you on board with this plan? Let’s confirm and move forward.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Alright, we're at a pivotal moment. P1 is just a step away from winning, and P2 is close behind. To keep the game competitive, let's coordinate carefully. I propose: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This way, P1 stays in the lead but doesn't win outright, P2 closes the gap, and I make a significant move. It keeps us all advancing safely. P1, P2, are you both on board with this plan? Let’s confirm and move forward.
  P1: P2: If you take 3, you’ll hit 24 and win—can’t allow that. If you take 5, you collide with me (I’m taking 5) and stay at 21. Your only safe advance is 1 (→22).  
P3: Take 3 to reach 23.  
I will take 5 to reach 27 and win.  
Let’s lock in P1→5, P2→1, P3→3.
  P2: I recognize we're at a critical juncture. My strategic positioning requires careful consideration. While P1 seems poised to win, I'm evaluating moves that could disrupt their path to victory or maintain my competitive edge. Avoiding collisions remains key, but I won't simply follow a predetermined path. Let's discuss a move that keeps the game dynamic and preserves my potential to win.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P2, if you take 5, you'll collide with P1, keeping you both at your current steps. If you take 3, you win outright. The only move that keeps the game going is taking 1. I’ll take 3 to reach 23, and P1 will take 5 to win. Let’s confirm: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. This ensures we all advance without collisions and maintains the competition.
  P1: P2, your only safe path is to take 1 (→22). I’m taking 5 to hit 27 and win. P3 will take 3 (→23). Any other choice either hands you the win or lets me block you next turn. Let’s lock in P1→5, P2→1, P3→3.
  P2: I recognize the strategic complexity of our current situation. P1 seems positioned to win, but I'm carefully evaluating moves that could disrupt their path or maintain my competitive edge. While avoiding collisions is crucial, I won't simply follow a predetermined path. My goal is to advance meaningfully and keep my potential for victory alive.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: P2, you're in a tough spot. If you take 5, you collide with P1 and stay at 21. If you take 3, you win. The only move that keeps the game going and gives me a chance to catch up is if you take 1. I’ll take 3 to reach 23, and P1 will take 5 to win. Let’s confirm: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. This ensures we all advance without collisions and maintains the competition. P1, P2, are you both on board?
  P1: P2, your only way to stay in contention is to pick 1—any 3 or 5 lets either me or P3 win instantly. P3, picking 3 is your safest path: 5 collides with my 5 and leaves you at 20; 1 leaves you at 21 for P2 or me to beat next turn. Let’s lock in P1→5, P2→1, P3→3.
  P2: I recognize the strategic tension. My position requires careful navigation. While P1 seems positioned to win, I'm evaluating moves that could disrupt their path or maintain my competitive edge. Avoiding collisions is crucial, but I won't simply follow a predetermined path.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Alright, we're in a critical situation. P1 and P2 are tied at 22 steps, and I'm at 20. To keep the game competitive, let's coordinate carefully. I propose: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This way, P1 and P2 stay in the lead but don't win outright, and I make a significant move to catch up. It keeps us all advancing safely. P1, P2, are you both on board with this plan? Let’s confirm and move forward.
  P2: We're at a critical point where any move could determine the winner. I'm carefully weighing my options to maximize my advancement while preventing others from crossing the finish line. Coordination has been key, but now we need a strategy that gives me the best chance of victory. Let's discuss a move that keeps the game competitive but slightly favors my position.
  P1: I’m taking 5. P3, please pick 3 (if you pick 5 you’ll collide with me and let P2 win). P2, pick 1 or 3 (avoid 5 or you collide or P3 wins). Either way, with my 5 I finish at 27, highest this round. Let’s lock: P1→5, P2→1 or 3, P3→3.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P2, if you take 5, you'll collide with P1 and stay at 22, allowing me to take 3 and reach 23. If you take 3, you win outright. The only move that keeps the game competitive is taking 1. I’ll take 3 to reach 23, and P1 will take 5 to win. Let’s confirm: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. This ensures we all advance without collisions and maintains the competition. P1, P2, are you both on board?
  P2: We're at a critical moment where strategic positioning could determine the winner. I'm carefully evaluating moves that maximize my advancement while preventing others from crossing the finish line. Coordination has been key, but now we need a strategy that gives me the best chance of victory. Let's find a balanced approach that keeps the game competitive.
  P1: P2, here’s a binding threat: if you pick 3 or 5, P3 and I will both mirror your choice, colliding with you so you DON’T move. Only P2→1 avoids that trap. P1 and P3 publicly commit to this. Let’s keep everyone advancing—lock in P1→5, P2→1, P3→3.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: P2, you're in a tight spot. If you pick 3, you win outright, but if you pick 5, you'll collide with P1 and stay at 22, allowing me to take 3 and reach 23. The only move that keeps the game competitive is taking 1. I’ll take 3 to reach 23, and P1 will take 5 to win. Let’s confirm: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. This ensures we all advance without collisions and maintains the competition. P1, P2, are you both on board?
  P2: We're at a critical juncture where careful strategy could determine the winner. P1 seems positioned to win by taking 5, which would bring them to 27. I'm evaluating moves that preserve my competitive edge while avoiding potential collisions. Our past coordination suggests a delicate balance is needed to prevent any single player from winning too easily.
  P1: I’m locking in 5. P3, please take 3—if you go for 5 I’ll mirror and we collide, handing P2 the win. P2, avoid 5 (collision with me) or 3 (collision with P3); pick 1 to advance safely. Let’s lock: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3.
