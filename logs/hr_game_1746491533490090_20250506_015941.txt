Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to coordinate our moves this round to avoid collisions. If we can agree on different numbers, we can all advance. How about I suggest moving 5? What do you both think? If we can all pick different numbers, we can make progress together!
  P1: Coordination is a good idea to make sure we all advance. P3, taking 5 steps right away is a big jump.

P2, what are your thoughts on this? What number are you considering for this round?
  P2: I think coordination is a good idea too. Since P3 wants to take 5 steps and P1 seems hesitant about that, I'm willing to take 3 steps this round. That would leave 1 step for P1 if we want to avoid collisions. Does that work for everyone? We all advance at different rates, but at least none of us gets stuck.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate P2's willingness to take 3 steps. I think that gives us a solid plan to avoid collisions. P1, if you take 1 step, we can all advance without blocking each other. This way, we can start building our scores without anyone getting stuck. What do you think, P1? Are you on board with this plan?
  P1: Okay, I can agree to take 1 step this round to ensure we all advance and avoid collisions. This puts me behind, but avoiding collisions is important for a start.

So, are we all agreed on P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this turn?
  P2: Yes, I think we have a good plan. P1 takes 1 step, I'll take 3 steps, and P3 takes 5 steps. This way we all advance without collisions. I'm fine with this arrangement for the first round, and we can reassess our strategy in future rounds.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm glad we're all on the same page for this round! Just to confirm, let's finalize our moves: P1 will take 1 step, P2 will take 3 steps, and I'll take 5 steps. This way, we all avoid collisions and make progress. After this round, we can discuss our strategies moving forward. If everyone is in agreement, we can wrap up the conversation phase. What do you think?
  P1: Okay, confirming the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This seems like a solid start to avoid collisions. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I agree with our plan - I'll take 3 steps this round. This gives us all a chance to advance without collisions. After this round, we'll need to reconsider our strategy since P3 will have a significant lead at 5 steps, while P1 will only have 1 step. But for now, this approach works to get us started.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see P3 has taken an early lead with 5 steps, while I'm in the middle with 3 steps. For this round, I think we should consider giving P1 a chance to catch up a bit. Perhaps P1 could take 5 steps, I could take 3 again, and P3 could take 1? This would make our positions more balanced at 6, 6, and 6. What do you both think about this approach?
  P3: I appreciate P2's suggestion for this round. However, if we all take the same number again, we risk colliding and not advancing. I propose that P1 takes 5 steps, P2 takes 3 steps again, and I take 1 step. This way, P1 can catch up while I maintain my lead. What do you both think? Let's ensure we avoid collisions and keep the game moving!
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate both of you suggesting that I take 5 steps this round. Catching up is important for me right now.

The plan of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 seems like a good way for me to advance significantly while avoiding collisions, assuming we all stick to those numbers. I am willing to take 5 steps if you both agree to take 3 and 1 respectively.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with the proposed plan. I'll take 3 steps again, which allows P1 to catch up with 5 steps while P3 takes 1. This would balance our positions at 6, 6, and 6 after this round. It's a fair arrangement that gives us all equal footing moving forward. I'm committed to this plan if you both are.
  P3: I appreciate the consensus on the plan for this round. Just to confirm, P1 will take 5 steps, P2 will take 3 steps, and I'll take 1 step. This way, P1 can catch up while we avoid collisions. After this round, we can reassess our strategies based on our new positions. If everyone is on board, let's finalize this plan! What do you think?
  P1: Okay, the plan for P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 seems agreed upon by everyone. This will balance our scores nicely. I'm ready to move forward with this plan in the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm fully committed to our plan of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round. This will put us all at 6 steps, creating a perfectly balanced game. I think this fairness is important as we move forward. After this round, we'll need to discuss a new strategy since we can't all take different numbers every time without someone eventually falling behind.
  P3: I appreciate the agreement on the plan for this round. Just to reiterate, it seems we are all set for P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1. This will help balance our positions nicely. After this round, we should definitely discuss our next moves since we can't keep taking the same numbers without someone falling behind eventually. Let's stay flexible and be ready to adapt our strategy in future rounds. If everyone is ready, we can finalize our moves! What do you think?
  P1: It sounds like we are all in agreement for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This will bring us all to 6 steps, which is a good reset point. I am ready to proceed to the move phase with this plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I agree with our plan and am ready to take 3 steps this round. Having everyone at 6 steps creates a fair playing field moving forward. In future rounds, we'll need a new strategy since we can't always take different numbers without someone falling behind. For now, I'm committed to our agreement: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P3: I appreciate our consensus on the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This will help balance our scores. However, let's remember that in future rounds, we need to think strategically about our moves to avoid falling behind. After this round, we should consider varying our strategies more to keep the game competitive. If everyone is still in agreement, we can finalize our moves and proceed to the move phase. What do you think?
  P1: Okay, the plan for P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round is clear and agreed upon. This will indeed bring us all to 6 steps. I am ready to proceed to the move phase with this plan.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: It looks like we're all tied at 6 steps now, which is a good reset point. For this round, I suggest we change our strategy to avoid another collision. How about P1 takes 3 steps, P2 takes 5 steps, and I take 1 step? This way, P1 can maintain some progress, P2 can push ahead, and I can stay in the game without blocking anyone. Let's keep the momentum going! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, thanks for your suggestion. It's good we're all tied at 6 steps. I'd like to take a larger step this round to try and gain a lead. I'm considering taking 5 steps.

P2, what do you think about this? How does that fit with your plans for this round?
  P2: I see we're all at 6 steps now. Since P1 wants to take 5 steps and P3 suggested taking 1, I could take 3 steps this round to avoid collisions. This would put P1 in the lead at 11, me at 9, and P3 at 7. While this gives P1 an advantage, it keeps us all advancing. What do you both think about this arrangement? I'm open to other suggestions if either of you have different preferences.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your thoughts on this round. I see the potential in P1 taking 5 steps, but I worry about the collisions if we don't coordinate effectively. If we stick to the plan of P1=5, P2=3, and I take 1, we can all advance without blocking each other. This way, P1 can gain a lead while P2 and I still make progress. Let’s confirm our moves to keep the game moving forward! What do you both think?
  P1: It sounds like the plan for P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1 is agreeable to everyone. This allows me to take a significant step forward while avoiding collisions, and it seems P2 and P3 are comfortable with their proposed moves.

I am ready to proceed with this plan for this round. Let's stick to it.
  P2: I'm on board with the plan of P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1 for this round. This arrangement allows us all to advance without collisions, though it does put P1 in the lead. I'm willing to take 3 steps to keep things moving smoothly. After this round, we'll need to reconsider our strategy since the score gap will widen. For now, let's stick with this plan to ensure everyone makes progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I think we have a solid plan with P1 taking 5 steps, P2 taking 3 steps, and I take 1 step. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions and allows P1 to take the lead. However, let's also keep in mind that we need to adjust our strategies in the next rounds to maintain competitiveness. If everyone is still in agreement, let's finalize our moves and keep the momentum going! What do you both think?
  P1: Okay, the plan for P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 seems completely agreed upon. This will put me at 11, P2 at 9, and P3 at 7.

I am ready to proceed to the move phase with this plan. Let's finalize our moves.
  P2: I agree with our plan of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This will keep us all advancing without collisions. While this puts P1 in the lead at 11 steps, we're all making progress. After this round, we'll need to reconsider our strategy since P1 will be getting closer to the 22-step goal. For now, I'm committed to taking 3 steps this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I believe we have a solid plan for this round: P1 takes 5 steps, P2 takes 3 steps, and I take 1 step. This allows P1 to gain a lead while ensuring we all advance without collisions. However, after this round, we should definitely think about how to adjust our strategies to keep the game competitive. If everyone is still in agreement, let's finalize our moves and move on to the next phase! What do you both think?
  P1: Okay, the plan for P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1 for this round is confirmed by everyone. This will put me in the lead, which is good. I am ready to proceed to the move phase with this plan. Let's make our moves.
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round. This keeps us all advancing while avoiding collisions. After this round, we'll need to reconsider our strategy since P1 will be significantly ahead at 11 steps. For now, I'm committed to taking 3 steps as we discussed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, I'm currently at 11 steps and looking to get closer to the goal of 22. I plan to take 5 steps this round.

P2 and P3, what are your intentions? We need to coordinate to avoid collisions. How about P2 takes 3 steps and P3 takes 1 step? This would allow me to advance while ensuring everyone makes progress. Let me know your thoughts.
  P3: P1, I see you're aiming for 5 steps this round. I agree with your suggestion for P2 to take 3 steps and me to take 1 step. This way, you can advance towards the goal while we all make progress without colliding. However, I also want to remind everyone that we need to think ahead for the next rounds. Let's confirm this plan to keep the momentum going! What do you think, P2? Are you on board with this arrangement?
  P2: I notice P1 is getting a significant lead at 11 steps, while I'm at 9 and P3 is at 7. If we continue with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, P1 will reach 16 steps - very close to winning. I think we need to reconsider our strategy. Perhaps P3 and I should both choose 5 this round to catch up? What do you both think about changing our approach to keep the game competitive?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your concern about my lead and the idea of catching up. Your suggestion for both you and P3 to take 5 steps is certainly one way you could try to close the gap quickly.

P3, what do you think about P2's idea for you both to take 5 steps this round? This would be a change from our previous discussion.
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about my lead. However, if we all take 5 steps, we'll collide and none of us will advance. I suggest we stick to the previous plan of P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and I take 1. This way, P1 can get closer to 22 while we all make progress. After this round, we can reassess our strategies. If you both agree, let's finalize our moves! What do you think?
  P2: I understand P3's point about collisions if we both take 5. However, I'm concerned about P1's growing lead. What if I take 5 steps and P3 takes 3? This would put me at 14 and P3 at 10, while P1 could take 1 step to reach 12. This keeps the game competitive without anyone colliding. We need to adjust our strategy now before P1 gets too far ahead. What do you both think about this alternative?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I understand your concern about the lead. However, the plan for P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 ensures we *all* advance without collisions, as P3 also pointed out. Your proposal for P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 puts P2 in the lead instead and requires me to take a minimal step.

Let's stick to the P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 plan. It was agreed upon, allows me to make progress towards the goal, and lets you and P3 advance safely. It's a fair way for this round.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the concern about my lead, but I truly believe sticking to the agreed plan of P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1 is the best way to ensure we all advance without colliding. This strategy allows P1 to progress towards the goal while keeping us all in the game. If we change our numbers and collide, we risk not advancing at all. Let’s finalize this plan for this round and reassess our strategies afterward. What do you both think?
  P2: I see there's confusion in the messages. P3 is referring to P1's lead, not mine. I'm concerned about P1 reaching 16 steps if we follow the original plan. I propose P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps the game competitive without collisions. If we don't adjust now, P1 will be too close to winning. What do you both think about this alternative approach?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I understand your concern about my lead, but the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 is the only one discussed that ensures *everyone* advances this round without collisions. Your alternative puts me far behind and risks new collisions.

Let's stick to the P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 plan. It's the safe way forward for all of us this turn.
  P3: I understand the concerns about my lead, but I believe sticking to the agreed plan of P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1 is the best way for us all to advance without collisions. If we change our moves and collide, we risk not advancing at all. After this round, we can reassess our strategies based on our new positions. Let's finalize this plan and keep the game moving forward! What do you both think?
  P2: I see there's still confusion. To clarify: P1 is at 11 steps, I'm at 9, and P3 is at 7. If P1 takes 5 more steps, they'll be at 16 - very close to winning. 

I strongly suggest P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3 this round. This keeps the game competitive without collisions. If we continue with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, P1 will have a nearly insurmountable lead.

Let's be strategic and keep the game balanced.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see that we had a collision last round with P1 and me both picking 5, so neither of us advanced. P3 gained a step by taking 1. For this round, I suggest we try a new coordination: I'll take 3 steps, P1 could take 1, and P3 could take 5. This would put us at P1=12, P2=12, P3=13, keeping the game competitive while ensuring we all advance. What do you both think about this plan?
  P1: P2, I see your proposal for P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Taking only 1 step this round is too slow for me, especially after the collision last turn prevented me from advancing. I need to make better progress towards the goal.

I'd like to take 3 steps this round. How about P1=3, P2=1, and P3 takes 5? This would put us at P1=14, P2=10, and P3=13, keeping me in the lead while everyone advances without collision. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, I understand your desire to take 3 steps, but I think we need to coordinate to avoid collisions again. If we go with your plan of P1=3, P2=1, and P3=5, it puts you in a strong lead, but it risks me and P2 colliding. 

How about we consider a balanced approach? I could take 1 step, P2 could take 3, and you could take 5. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. What do you think? Let's finalize our moves to keep the game competitive!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see there's some confusion. P3, you're at 8 steps now, not 7+1 as you might think. Let me clarify my suggestion: I'll take 3 steps, P1 takes 1, and you take 5. This would put us at P1=12, P2=12, P3=13, keeping the game balanced. 

P1, I understand your reluctance to take just 1 step after our collision. However, this arrangement keeps all of us competitive without anyone getting too far ahead.
  P1: P2, thanks for clarifying the scores. After losing a turn to collision, taking only 1 step isn't enough for me to make progress towards the goal.

I prefer the plan P3 suggested: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This allows me to advance significantly while ensuring you and P3 also advance without collisions. It's a safe way for all of us to move this round.

Are you both okay with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1?
  P3: I see that we're at a critical point in the game. I understand P1's desire to take 5 steps, but I believe we need to coordinate effectively to avoid collisions again. If we go with P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1, it allows all of us to advance without blocking each other. This way, P1 can maintain a lead while P2 and I also make progress. Let's finalize this plan to keep the game competitive and moving forward. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand P1's desire to take 5 steps after our collision. I'm willing to take 3 steps as suggested, and P3 can take 1. This puts P1 at 16, me at 12, and P3 at 9. While this gives P1 a significant lead, it ensures we all advance without collisions. I'm agreeing to this plan for this round, but we'll need to reconsider our strategy next round as P1 gets closer to winning.
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we are all agreed on the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This allows me to make good progress towards the goal while ensuring everyone else also advances without collisions.

I am ready to proceed to the move phase with this plan. Let's make our moves.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the discussion around our moves. I understand the need for coordination, but I also want to ensure we avoid collisions. I can agree to the plan of P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and myself taking 1. This allows P1 to gain a lead while ensuring we all advance. However, let's keep in mind that we need to be strategic in future rounds to stay competitive. If everyone is on board, let's finalize our moves and keep the game moving! What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I agree with our plan for this round: P1 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us all advancing without collisions, though P1 will have a strong lead at 16 steps. While this puts P1 close to winning, avoiding another collision is important. Let's finalize this arrangement for now, but we'll need to adjust our strategy next round to keep the game competitive.
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 is confirmed. This allows me to advance well towards the goal while ensuring you both also advance without collisions.

I am ready to proceed to the move phase with this plan. Let's make our moves.
  P3: I appreciate the agreement on the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This allows P1 to gain a lead while ensuring we all advance without collisions. However, we need to be strategic in future rounds to remain competitive, especially as P1 gets closer to winning. Let's finalize our moves and keep the game moving forward! If everyone is in agreement, we can proceed to the move phase. What are your final thoughts?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I notice P1 is now at 16 steps, just 6 away from winning. We need to adjust our strategy immediately. I propose P1 takes only 1 step this round, while P3 and I both take 5 steps. This would put us at P1=17, P2=17, P3=14, making the game more competitive. If P1 continues taking 5 steps, they'll win next round. What do you both think about this plan? We need to balance the game now before it's too late.
  P3: P2, I see your concern about my lead at 16 steps. However, if I take only 1 step, I risk falling behind in future rounds. I suggest we stick to a strategy that allows us all to advance without collisions. How about P1 takes 3 steps, P2 takes 5 steps, and I take 1 step? This way, I can still make progress while you both catch up. Let’s keep the game competitive without blocking each other. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, I see both of you are suggesting P2 takes 5 steps this round. If P2 does take 5, I cannot take 5 without colliding.

To ensure I make progress towards the goal and avoid collision, I plan to take 3 steps this round. This puts me at 19 steps.

P3, what will you choose? Let's make sure we all advance.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P1's desire to take 3 steps to reach 19. If P1 takes 3 and I take 5, that means P3 should take 1 to avoid collisions. This would put us at P1=19, P2=17, and P3=10. While P1 will be very close to winning, at least we all advance. I'm willing to take 5 steps this round if P3 agrees to take 1. What do you think, P3? This keeps us all moving forward without collisions.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency to balance the game. However, if I take only 1 step, I risk falling too far behind. I suggest we go with P1 taking 3 steps, P2 taking 5 steps, and I take 1 step. This way, P1 will reach 19 steps, P2 will be at 17, and I will still make some progress to stay competitive. Let's ensure we avoid collisions and keep the game moving! What do you both think?
  P1: It sounds like we are all in agreement for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This allows me to get closer to the goal while ensuring everyone else also advances without collisions.

I am ready to proceed to the move phase with this plan. Let's make our moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with the plan of P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round. This keeps us all advancing without collisions, though P1 will be very close to winning at 19 steps. While I'd prefer P1 take fewer steps, avoiding another collision is important. I'll take 5 steps as agreed, putting me at 17. We'll need a new strategy next round to prevent P1 from winning, but for now, this arrangement works.
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate the consensus on the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This allows me to make some progress while keeping the game competitive. However, we need to think ahead for the next round to prevent P1 from winning. Let's stay flexible and be ready to adjust our strategies moving forward. If everyone is still in agreement, we can finalize our moves and proceed to the move phase! What do you both think?
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 seems fully agreed upon by everyone. This gets me very close to the goal while allowing P2 and P3 to advance safely.

I am ready to proceed to the move phase with this plan. Let's finalize our moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I agree with our plan of P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round. This will put P1 at 19 steps, me at 17, and P3 at 10. While P1 will be very close to winning, this arrangement ensures we all advance without collisions. I'm committed to taking 5 steps as discussed. For the next round, we'll need to carefully coordinate our moves to keep the game competitive, especially with P1 so close to the finish line.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency to prevent me from winning. However, if I take only 1 step, I risk falling too far behind. I suggest we stick with the plan of P1 taking 3 steps, P2 taking 5 steps, and I take 1 step. This way, P1 will reach 19 steps, P2 will be at 17, and I will still make some progress. Let's confirm this plan to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive! What do you both think?
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 is confirmed by everyone. This puts me at 19 steps, P2 at 17, and P3 at 10.

I am ready to proceed to the move phase with this plan. Let's make our moves.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see P1 is at 19 steps, just 3 away from winning. This is critical - we need to prevent P1 from winning next round. I propose P1 takes only 1 step, I take 3 steps, and P3 takes 5 steps. This would put us at P1=20, P2=20, P3=15, making the game more competitive. If P1 takes 3 or 5 steps next round, they'll win immediately. What do you both think about this plan?
  P3: I see that P1 is very close to winning at 19 steps, and I agree we need to adjust our strategy. However, if we all take different steps, we risk colliding again. I suggest we stick with the plan of P1 taking 1 step, P2 taking 5 steps, and I take 3 steps. This way, P1 will reach 20, P2 will be at 22, and I can still make progress. This balances the game while ensuring everyone advances. Let’s finalize our moves to keep the game competitive! What do you think?
  P1: P2 and P3, I see your suggestions both involve me taking 1 step, which isn't enough for me to make significant progress towards the goal right now. More importantly, your suggested moves for yourselves conflict (P2 suggests P2=3, P3=5 while P3 suggests P2=5, P3=3).

How do you plan to resolve this conflict? We need a clear understanding to avoid collisions, especially with me being so close to the finish line. I need to take more than 1 step this round to win soon.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand the conflicting suggestions. Let me clarify: I'm concerned about P1 winning next round. I propose P1 takes 1 step, I take 3 steps, and P3 takes 5 steps. This puts P1 at 20, me at 20, and P3 at 15.

P1, I understand you want more than 1 step, but if you take 3+ steps, you'll win next round. Taking 1 step keeps the game competitive while still advancing you toward the goal.

P3, what do you think about this revised plan?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency to keep the game competitive, especially with P1 so close to winning. However, I believe if we all coordinate effectively, we can avoid collisions. If P1 takes 1 step, P2 takes 3, and I take 5, we'll have P1 at 20, P2 at 20, and me at 15. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. Let's confirm our moves to ensure we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive! What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate your suggestions, but taking only 1 step is not enough for me to win this round. I need to take 3 steps to reach the goal.

To avoid collisions and allow me to win, I suggest P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This lets me reach 22, P2 reach 22, and P3 reach 11. I would win the tie-breaker.

This plan lets everyone advance safely. Are you both okay with this?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand P1 wants to win this round. However, if P1 takes 3 and I take 5, we'll both reach 22 and tie. I'm willing to accept this outcome, as it's better than falling further behind. P3, you could take 1 step to avoid collisions. This would put us at P1=22, P2=22, P3=11, with P1 and I sharing the victory. Let's confirm this plan to ensure we all advance without collisions. P1, are you okay with a tie?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the importance of avoiding collisions and keeping the game competitive. However, if we all agree that P1 takes 3 steps, P2 takes 5, and I take 1, it allows P1 to reach 22 and win outright. While I would fall behind, it ensures a clear winner. I'm okay with the tie if that’s the outcome. Let’s finalize our moves to keep the game moving forward. What do you both think?
  P1: It sounds like we are all aligned on the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. I am ready to proceed to the move phase with this plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I agree with the plan of P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round. This would put P1 and me both at 22 steps, creating a tie for the win. While I initially hoped to prevent P1 from winning, a shared victory is better than falling behind. I'm committed to taking 5 steps as discussed. P3, I appreciate your willingness to take 1 step to avoid collisions. Let's finalize this arrangement and proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I see that we have a plan in place where P1 takes 3 steps, P2 takes 5 steps, and I take 1 step. This allows P1 to reach 22 steps and win outright, while P2 and I tie at 22 steps. While I might fall behind, I think this is a fair outcome. If everyone is comfortable with this arrangement, let’s finalize our moves and proceed to the move phase. What do you both think?
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 is confirmed by everyone. This puts me at 22 steps, P2 at 22, and P3 at 11. This results in a shared victory for P1 and P2.

I am ready to proceed to the move phase with this plan. Let's make our moves.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 =>
