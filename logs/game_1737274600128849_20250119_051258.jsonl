The rotation we've been using has been effective in helping us avoid collisions and make steady progress. However, as you both know, I'm currently trailing behind with only 5 steps, while P1 is at 13 and P3 is at 9. I'm concerned that if I don't catch up soon, I might not have a chance to win.  \n\nI propose that we adjust our rotation for the next few rounds to give each player a turn at taking the larger steps. For example, in this round, I would take 5 steps, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. In the following round, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1, and so on. This way, we can all have opportunities to make bigger leaps without causing collisions.  \n\nI believe this approach is fair and will help keep the game competitive and exciting.
