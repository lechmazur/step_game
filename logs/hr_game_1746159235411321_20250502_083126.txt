Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. How about P1 and P2 choose <move>1</move>, and I'll choose <move>3</move>? This way, we all make progress. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, your suggestion favors you slightly. To keep it fair, let's rotate who gets the higher number each round. I'll take <move>3</move> this turn, you two choose <move>1</move>, and next round we rotate. Agreed?
  P1: I agree with P2's rotation plan. Let's stick to it to avoid collisions. I'll take 1 this turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Alright, I agree with the rotation plan. To confirm, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and P1 and I will take <move>1</move> this round. Next round, I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions. Good luck everyone!
  P2: Sounds good, P3. Let's stick to this clear rotation plan to keep things fair and efficient.
  P1: Agreed, let's stick to the rotation. P2 takes 3, P3 and I take 1. Keep it smooth to avoid collisions. Ready for the move phase?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Alright, everyone seems to be on board with the rotation plan. Just to reiterate quickly: P2 takes <move>3</move>, P1 and I take <move>1</move> this round. Next round, I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. Let's keep this rotation to minimize conflicts. Good luck to all!
  P2: All set. Let's proceed to the move phase. Good luck!
  P1: P1: Confirmed. Let's stick to the rotation. Move phase ready!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's keep pushing forward. I'll take 5 again to accelerate. Let's avoid collisions and move strategically!
  P2: P1, you broke our agreement immediately—that undermines trust. If everyone picks high now, we'll collide and nobody advances. Let's reconsider cooperation. P3, what's your thought?
  P3: P1, your move last round definitely threw off our plan. P2 is right; trust is crucial if we want to avoid collisions. Let's reset and try to coordinate again. How about this round, I take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>? This way, we can still follow a rotation and minimize conflicts. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Apologies for last round. Let's stick to the rotation: I take 1, P2 5, P3 3. No collisions, efficient progress.
  P2: Alright, let's give cooperation another shot. I'll take 5 as agreed, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. If anyone deviates again, we'll all lose progress. Trust is fragile—let's rebuild it carefully.
  P3: Let's solidify our plan for this round. P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This keeps us on track with our rotation and helps rebuild trust. Remember, cooperation is key to avoiding collisions and making progress. Let's stick to the plan and move forward efficiently. Good luck everyone!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's stick to the rotation. I'll take 1. No collisions, efficient progress. Ready for moves!
  P2: All set. Let's stick to this plan and rebuild trust. Ready for moves!
  P3: Let's confirm our moves one last time before we proceed to the move phase. P1, you're taking <move>1</move>, P2, you're taking <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. Sticking to this plan ensures we all make progress without collisions. Trust is key here, so let's commit to our agreed moves. Good luck to everyone!

  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let's adjust the rotation: I'll take 5, P2 take 1, P3 take 3. This avoids collisions and accelerates my progress. Agree?
  P2: P1, you already took the higher moves twice. If we keep letting you accelerate, you'll easily outpace us. Let's keep it fair—this round, I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and you take 1. This maintains balance and rebuilds trust. Agreed?
  P3: P1, I understand your desire to accelerate, but P2 is right. We need to keep it fair to maintain trust and cooperation. Let's stick to the original rotation plan with a slight adjustment for balance. This round, P2 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This way, we all progress without collisions and keep the game fair. Let's agree on this and move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's stick to the rotation: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. This ensures fairness and avoids collisions. Let's commit to this plan.
  P2: Glad we're aligned again. Let's stick strictly to the agreed moves this round to keep our momentum and trust intact. Ready when you are.
  P3: Let's finalize our plan for this round: P2 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This maintains our progression and avoids collisions. Sticking to this plan ensures we all move forward efficiently. Trust is crucial, so let's commit to our agreed moves. Good luck to everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Let's stick to the rotation: I take 1, P2 5, P3 3. No deviations. Trust is key—let's move forward without collisions.
  P2: All set. Let's proceed to moves and stick to our agreed plan. Good luck!
  P3: Let's ensure we're all on the same page before moving. P2 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. Remember, trust and cooperation are vital. Sticking to this plan helps us all progress. Let's confirm and proceed to the move phase. Good luck!

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Good cooperation last round. To keep things smooth and fair, let's rotate again: this round, P3 takes 5, I'll take 1, and P1 takes 3. Agreed?
  P1: P1: Agreed. Let's stick to the rotation. I'll take 3 to keep progress smooth and avoid collisions. Let's move forward together.
  P3: Let's confirm our plan for this round to ensure we all stay on track. P3 (me) will take <move>5</move>, P2 will take <move>1</move>, and P1 will take <move>3</move>. This keeps our rotation fair and helps us avoid collisions. Trust and cooperation have worked well so far, so let's continue with this strategy. Good luck everyone!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, we're aligned. Trust has been rebuilt nicely. Let's stick carefully to this rotation plan—no surprises. Ready to move forward smoothly.
  P1: P1: Let's stick to the rotation—P3 takes 5, P2 takes 1, I take 3. Avoid collisions and keep progress steady. Ready to move?
  P3: Alright, let's finalize our moves for this round. P3 (me) will take <move>5</move>, P2 will take <move>1</move>, and P1 will take <move>3</move>.

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm just one step away from winning. If I pick 1, I reach exactly 20 and win—unless someone collides with me. If either of you tries to stop me by choosing 1, you'll sacrifice your own progress and let the other player advance freely. Think carefully. It might be smarter to secure your own positions rather than risking a collision to block me.
  P1: P3, let's block P2 by both picking 1. If he picks 1, we collide and he doesn't win. Ready?
  P3: P2 is right; blocking him means sacrificing our own progress. P3 suggests we focus on our own advancement. Let's both pick <move>3</move> to avoid collision and ensure we keep moving forward. This way, we maintain our positions and let the game play out fairly. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, choosing 1 to block me only helps P3. P3 already said they'll pick 3, so if you collide with me at 1, P3 advances alone and gains a big advantage over you. Think carefully—your best chance is to secure your own progress and compete with P3 directly next round.
  P1: P1: I'll pick 1 to block P2. If he chooses 1, we collide and he loses the win. Let's stop him now!
  P3: P1, think strategically. If you pick 1 and P2 also picks 1, you both collide, and P2 doesn't win, but neither do you progress. Meanwhile, I'll move ahead with <move>3</move>. Instead, consider picking <move>3</move> with me. This way, we both advance and keep the game competitive. P2 might win next round, but at least we'll be in a strong position to challenge in the following rounds. Let's focus on our own progress and avoid helping each other unintentionally. Good luck!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, choosing 1 to block me only hands P3 the advantage. If you're determined to collide, you'll sacrifice your own chance to win. P3 is openly choosing 3—think carefully about your best move here.
  P1: P1: P3, let's both pick 3. If P2 takes 1, he wins, but we stay in the game. Avoiding collision keeps us competitive. Ready?
  P3: P1, I'm glad you're reconsidering the strategy. Picking <move>3</move> is a smart move for both of us. P2 is likely to pick <move>1</move> to win, so let's focus on our own progress. If P2 wins this round, we'll be tied and can compete fairly in the next rounds. Let's avoid collisions and ensure we both advance. Good luck to everyone! Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
