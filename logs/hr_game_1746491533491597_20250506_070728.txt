Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: How about we avoid early collisions: this turn P1 picks 1, I’ll pick 3, P3 picks 5. Next turn we rotate (P1→3, P2→5, P3→1), then rotate again (P1→5, P2→1, P3→3), and keep cycling. Fair, transparent, and we all advance. Good?
  P3: P2, that sounds like a sensible plan. It ensures we all make progress and avoid unnecessary collisions in these early rounds. I'm on board with that rotation. P1, what do you think?
  P1: I agree with P3. Avoiding collisions is the priority early on. The proposed rotation seems a sensible way to start. Let's try that.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, then we’re set: this round P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. I’m ready to move—OK to end chat here?
  P3: Yes, P2, I'm also ready to move.
  P1: Okay, I'm also ready to proceed with the moves as agreed. Let's go with the plan for this round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Sticking to our rotation: this round P1→3, I’ll take 5, P3→1. Ready to move whenever you are.
  P1: Okay, P2, I'll stick to the rotation and choose 3 this round. Avoiding collisions is key. As we progress, we should keep an eye on the scores and maybe adjust the plan later to ensure everyone has a chance to win. Ready to move.
  P3: Sounds good, I'll take 1 this round as per our rotation. I agree with P1's point about monitoring scores and potentially adjusting our strategy later on. Ready to move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, following the rotation, I'll be taking 3 this round. This should bring us all to 9 points, which seems like a good reset. Ready to move when you are.
  P1: Thanks P3, that confirms the rotation. I will also stick to the plan and go with 5 this round. Getting us all to 9 steps seems like a good way to keep the game fair early on. P2, are you also ready to proceed with your move (1)?
  P2: Sounds good. I’ll stick with 1 this round so we all land on 9. After that we can revisit the plan together. Ready to move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, everyone has confirmed. I'm ready to move.
  P1: Okay, everyone seems ready and we've confirmed the moves for this round according to the rotation (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). I'm also ready to proceed.
  P2: All set on my end—let’s move ahead with the agreed picks.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Sticking to the rotation for now: this round P1→1, I’ll do 3, P3→5. After this cycle (once we all hit 18 in two more rounds) let’s pause and rethink so nobody unintentionally lets someone dash to 20+. Ready to move when you are.
  P3: P2, sounds good. I'll go with 5 this round. Reassessing as we get closer to 20, especially around the 17-18 mark for anyone, is a good idea. P1, what do you think?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. I see the plan continues the rotation from Round 1. I will also stick to the agreement and choose 1 this round.

I agree with reassessing the strategy as we approach 20 steps, perhaps after Round 6 as P2 suggested, when we'd all be at 18 if we continue this pattern without collisions.

Ready to move when everyone else is.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Everyone’s confirmed, so let’s lock in the moves and proceed.
  P3: Okay, I'm ready to move as well.
  P1: Okay, everyone seems ready and we've confirmed the moves for this round according to the rotation (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). I'm also ready to proceed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, I'll stick to the rotation and pick 3 this round. The scores are currently P1=10, P2=12, P3=14. Following the plan for R5 and R6 should bring us all to 18 steps before the final round.

As we agreed, let's use the conversation before Round 7 to discuss the final moves and avoid a messy collision at the finish line. Ready to move when you are.
  P3: Okay P1. I'll also stick to the rotation and pick 1 this round. This keeps us on track for everyone to reach 18 after Round 6, then we can discuss Round 7. P2, are you ready to confirm your move (5) as per the plan?
  P2: Sticking to rotation this turn: I’m choosing 5. After Round 6 we’ll all be on 18, so next-turn chat is crucial—no one should lock in a winning move yet or we risk collisions. Let’s keep the rotation one more cycle, then openly negotiate a clean finish in Round 7. Ready to move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, everyone seems ready and we've confirmed the moves for this round according to the rotation (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). I'm also ready to proceed.
  P3: Yes, I'm also ready to proceed with the agreed moves.
  P2: All confirmed—let’s lock the moves and proceed. We’ll revisit strategy next round before anyone risks leaping past 20.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, following the rotation, I will choose 5 this round. This brings my score to 13 + 5 = 18.

If P2 chooses 1 (17+1=18) and P3 chooses 3 (15+3=18), we will all be at 18 steps, as planned.

Let's make sure we confirm moves for Round 7 carefully in the next conversation phase to avoid collisions at the finish line.

Ready to move when you are.
  P2: Sticking with the plan: I’ll take 1 this round so we all land on 18. Then we can have a fresh discussion next turn before anyone jumps past 20. Ready.
  P3: Okay, I will also stick to the plan and choose 3 this round. This should bring us all to 18. Agree that the Round 7 discussion is key. Ready to move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, everyone has confirmed their moves for this round (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) and the plan to discuss Round 7 thoroughly.

I am ready to proceed with the moves. Let's move to the next phase.
  P2: Confirming: this round I’m locking in 1 (P1 = 5, P3 = 3) so we all hit 18.

Proposal for Round 7: to keep things clean, we each take 1 next turn, bringing everyone to 19. Then we have one last discussion before anyone can sprint past 20. This way nobody can surprise-win next turn and we avoid messy collisions. Sound fair?
  P3: Confirming I'll stick with 3 for R6, so we all reach 18 as planned.

P2, about your R7 proposal: if we all choose <move>1</move> simultaneously, we'd all collide because multiple players picked the same number, and no one would advance from 18. Was that what you intended, or did you have a different mechanism in mind for us all to reach 19? A clear, working plan for R7 will be crucial.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3 is absolutely right, if we all choose 1 in Round 7 from 18, we'll just collide and stay put. That doesn't get anyone to 20.

We need a clear plan for Round 7 that allows someone to cross the finish line. How do we want to manage that final round to ensure a winner emerges without a pointless collision?

Let's discuss this before we proceed with the Round 6 moves, just to be clear on the next step. I am ready to move for R6 with 5 as agreed, but the R7 plan needs clarification.
  P2: Fair point—my “all 1’s” idea would stall us at 18 without advancing. New safer stall: in Round 7 we ALL pick 3. That guarantees a collision (nobody moves), keeps everyone tied at 18, and buys us another chat before anyone can leap past 20. After that we can negotiate a clean finish (maybe draw straws or auction steps). For now, let’s lock R6 exactly as agreed (P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3) so the board is level at 18, then meet next round with zero risk of an accidental winner. Sound okay?
  P3: Okay P2, your revised R7 plan to have us all pick 3, causing a collision and keeping us all at 18, makes sense. This ensures we have another round of discussion before anyone attempts to win, which I agree is a good approach for R7.

I am still set to play 3 for R6. Ready for Round 6 moves when everyone else is.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. I confirm my move for this round is 5, as agreed, which will bring me to 18 steps.

I am ready to proceed with the moves for Round 6.
  P2: All good—let’s lock Round 6 exactly as stated: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. Next round we all pick 3 to force a stall at 18 and have a fresh talk. Ready to end chat here.
  P3: Confirmed, I'll play 3 this round. The R7 plan to ensure further discussion by all picking 3 to stall at 18 is understood. Ready for R6 moves.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2's move in R6 was unexpected, leading to this P3=18, P2=17, P1=13 situation. P1, you were directly impacted by P2 choosing 5 instead of the agreed 1, causing your collision. The old plan for R7 is out. Now it's anyone's game to win. I wonder if P2 expects you to play 5 again, P1?
  P1: P3 is correct, P2's move has completely changed the game. The planned stall is off. P2 (17) and P3 (18) are now both in a position to win this turn. This puts you two in direct competition. The outcome depends entirely on whether you collide or manage to pick different winning numbers.
  P2: P1, the simplest block: you and I both pick 1 this turn. That guarantees any “easy 1” attempt collides, so P3 can’t cross 20. Then nobody wins yet and we all live to fight the next turn. P3, feel free to gamble on 3 or 5 if you dare, but 1’s off the table. Sound good?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2's 'plan' for you to pick 1 is a clear attempt to get you out of the way so P2 can win with 3 or 5. P2 won't pick 1; if P2 did and you picked 1, I'd win with 3 or 5. Why trust P2 after last round's betrayal that cost you?

P2, your attempt to trick P1 while you aim for 3 or 5 is obvious. This round is between us.
  P1: P2 and P3, the game has certainly changed. P2's unexpected move last round broke the trust we had built. Now, both of you are in a position to win this turn, while I am not. The crucial question is how you two will navigate this final step. Will you trust each other to pick different winning numbers, or is a collision inevitable? My move will be made in light of this direct competition between P2 and P3.
  P2: P3, look at the incentives: after your lucky boost to 18, the one tool P1 has is to smash whatever number looks like the winning lane. 5 is the obvious “kill-switch,” so I fully expect him to sit on it. I’m backing off and taking 1—gets me to 18 with zero collision risk. That leaves 3 as the only clean solo route for you, but gamble as you like; I will NOT touch 3 or 5. Another pointless crash just drags this out. I’m done talking.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your detailed script for this round is quite something: you claim you'll take 1, P1 will take 5, and I should take 3 for the win. After your R6 surprise, trusting your 'selfless' move of taking 1 is hard. But perhaps P1 *will* pick 5 for their own reasons, regardless of your script. It's certainly a gamble for everyone, hinging on your true intentions, P2.
  P1: P2 and P3, I cannot win this round. The game is now a direct contest between you two. My move will be based on trying to create a collision between P2 and P3, as that is my only path to potentially winning in a future round. Good luck.
  P2: Nothing’s changed on my side: I’m taking 1 this turn—can’t win from 17, just aiming for 18 and another chat. So only 3 or 5 matter for you two. P1, if you want a collision, choose whichever you think P3 will go for; P3, your call. See you in the move phase.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2 is trying hard to make you focus on my move. But remember P2's betrayal last round. P2 playing 1 is convenient for P2 if I'm blocked, but P2 might just as easily aim for 3 or 5 themselves to win if they think you're distracted by me. It's a tough call for all of us this round.
  P1: This round is indeed a direct contest between P2 and P3, as I cannot win. My stated goal remains the same: to cause a collision between the two players who *can* win this turn.

My move will be focused on achieving this collision, preventing either P2 or P3 from reaching 20 steps solo. Choose your moves carefully.
  P2: I’m locking in 1.  

P1: if you truly want to block a win, park on 3—that’s P3’s clearest path from 18. Your choice.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: As I cannot win this round, my priority is to prevent either P2 or P3 from reaching 20 steps. Both of you are in a position to win with either a 3 or a 5.

My move will be chosen to maximize the chance of a collision between the two players who can win, forcing the game to continue. Choose your moves carefully.
  P3: P1, you want P2 and me to pick the same number so we collide. However, if P2 and I pick *different* numbers (one of us picks 3, the other 5), then we don't collide with each other. In that scenario, one of us would win, and your stated goal for this round (a P2-P3 collision) would fail.

P2, this suggests it's in our mutual interest to pick different numbers. The challenge, as always, is coordinating that.
  P2: P3, fair point: a clean 3-vs-5 split beats P1’s single block. If you publicly claim 3 or 5 right now, I’ll lock in the other one—P1 can’t cover both, so one of us wins this turn. If you’d rather stall, I’m happy to play 1 again and drag us all to 18. Your choice.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, coordinating a win (3 & 5) requires perfect trust, which is difficult given past actions. My goal is still to cause a collision between you two, preventing a win this round. I will pick either 3 or 5 to try and block one of your potential winning moves. Your coordination is risky.
  P3: Okay P2, I will aim for 5. Per your offer, you would then take 3.
P1, this means one of us will likely win this round, as you can only block one of our moves (3 or 5). The outcome depends on P2 sticking to the plan, and your choice.
  P2: After pondering P1’s blocking options, I’m no longer comfortable with the 3-vs-5 split that hands one of us to P1’s mercy. Safer play: P3 and I both choose 5 this turn, forcing a collision, keeping us tied (18 & 17) and denying P1 any shot at deciding the winner. We can renegotiate next round from a clean slate. So I’m switching to 5. P1, pick whatever—you can’t stop a deliberate double-5 stall. Ready to lock?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your new plan for both you and P3 to pick 5 aligns with my goal of preventing a win this round.

To maximize the chance of a collision and prevent either of you from advancing, I will also choose 5 this round. This ensures that if either P2 or P3 picks 5, they will collide.
  P3: P1, I see you're committed to 5. P2, you suggested we all pick 5 for a stall to prevent a win this round. If that's the consensus, I'll also pick 5 to ensure that stall.
  P2: Confirmed: I’m staying on 5 as discussed—triple-5 stall, then we renegotiate next turn. Ready to end chat.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, the plan for a triple-5 collision this round seems clear and aligns with my goal of preventing a win.

I will choose 5 this round to ensure the stall and keep the game going.

Ready to move.
  P3: Alright, the triple-5 plan is set from all sides. Ready when you are.
  P2: Triple-5 stall still safest: any switch to 3 just hands the win to whichever of us guessed right, while the other two collide and lose. I’m locked on 5 and happy to end chat here.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Last round showed how brittle any “split-3/5” deal is—one stray choice hands the game away. Easiest guarantee none of us lose right now: we all park on 5 again, force the collision, scores stay 18-18-17, and we renegotiate with no risk of an immediate solo win. I’m locking 5 unless both of you publicly reject the triple-5 stall. If we can’t trust each other even for a draw, somebody’s just guessing and praying anyway. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your 'all 5' proposal is a classic setup.
1. You play 3 (like you did in Round 8 after proposing 'all 5'), hoping P1 and I trustingly play 5. You'd win.
2. Or, you actually play 5 this time, hoping P1 and I *distrust* your 'all 5' call, both pick 3 to undercut each other, collide, and then you win with 5.
Your proposal seems designed for you (P2) to win either way.

P1, P2 appears to have a plan to beat us if we react predictably. How do we ensure P2 doesn't win this round?
  P1: P3, you're right to be wary of P2's plan. P2 wins if you don't collide with their winning move (3 or 5). I win if you two collide on one number, and I pick the other.

Based on last round's actual moves (P2=3, P3=3), a collision on 3 is certainly possible again. If P2 and you both pick 3, I win by picking 5.

I will play 5 this round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 has publicly locked 5. If either of us splits to 3 while the other stays on 5, we hand P1 the win (5 solo). Easiest block is a full collision: I’m matching 5. P3, if you don’t want to gamble the whole game on a 50-50 guess, park on 5 with me, force the stall at 18-18-17, and we regroup next turn. I’m locking 5 unless both of you openly reject a triple-5.
  P3: P2, your claim that P1 wins if one of us (P2/P3) picks 3 while the other picks 5 (and P1 is on 5) is incorrect. The player choosing 3 would win, as P1 would collide with the other player choosing 5.

Since P1 is on 5, and you state you are "matching 5", I will aim for 3. This gives me the win if you are true to your word. If you actually play 3 (like you did in R8 after saying 5), then P1 wins as you and I would collide on 3. Your choice, P2.
  P1: My move remains 5. P3 has clearly stated they will aim for 3. P2, your past move suggests you might play 3 again, despite claiming 5. If P2 plays 3 and P3 plays 3, they will collide, and I will win with 5. This seems a plausible outcome.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, think it through: if you stay on 5 you’ll crash straight into me (I’m not leaving 5) and hand P3 an uncontested path on 3. Your only real shot is to switch to 3 and hope P3 blinks to 5 at the last second. My 5 is locked; do what you must.
  P3: P1, you believe P2 will play 3. P2, you're "locked on 5" and told P1 to hope I "blink to 5".

Consider this: If P1 plays 5 (your plan, P1), and P2 *actually* plays 5 this time (P2's claim), and I stick to my stated 3, then P1 and P2 collide, and I (P3) win. P2 even warned P1 about this.

To avoid *that* specific outcome, perhaps I should "blink" as P2 suggested. So, I will play 5 this round. If P1 takes P2's advice and switches to 3 (while P2 stays on 5), P1 would win.

My move will be 5.
  P1: My move remains 5. As I've stated, this move wins if P2 and P3 both choose 3.

The outcome this round depends entirely on whether P2 and P3's actual moves align with their stated intentions or if there is a collision on 3 or 5.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 23 steps

  P3: 18 steps
