Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi P1 and P3, let's try to avoid collision this round so we can all make some progress. Maybe we can pick different numbers?
  P3: Sure, sounds good. Let's coordinate clearly to avoid collisions. I'm fine picking last, so you two can choose your preferred numbers first.
  P1: Thanks, P3. I’ll take <move>3</move> this round. P2, feel free to choose between 1 or 5. Let’s all move forward without blocking each other.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, I will choose <move>5</move> then. P3, you can pick <move>1</move> this round to ensure we all move.
  P3: Great, I agree with this plan. I'll choose <move>1</move> this round. Let's keep this coordination going in future rounds too.
  P1: Glad we’re all on the same page. If this works smoothly, we can rotate choices next round to keep it fair. Let’s make sure we all advance this turn.

  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Good coordination last round! To keep things fair and avoid collisions, let's rotate our choices as suggested. P1, you can take <move>5</move>, P2, you pick <move>1</move>, and I'll go with <move>3</move> this round. Does that sound good to everyone?
  P1: Sounds fair to me, P3. I’m on board with taking <move>5</move> this round. If we all stick to the rotation, we’ll all keep moving forward without blocking each other. Let’s keep it smooth.
  P2: P1 and P3, rotating sounds like a good plan to ensure we all progress. I agree to pick <move>1</move> this round as suggested. Let's continue with this rotation for now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Perfect, glad we're all agreed. Let's lock in these moves and keep the momentum going!
  P1: Thanks for confirming, everyone. Let’s stick to the agreed rotation this round: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. If this works again, we can rotate forward next round to keep it balanced. Looking good so far!
  P2: Okay, sounds good to me too. Let's do those moves: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>.

  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: That collision last round with P3 slowed us both down—let’s get back on track. How about this: P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I’ll take <move>1</move> this round. That way, no one repeats last round’s pick, and we all move forward. Thoughts?
  P3: I agree, P1. Let's stick clearly to these moves to avoid another collision. I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, your plan sounds good for this round. I agree to pick <move>3</move> as suggested. Let's make sure we all choose our agreed moves this time to avoid any more collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Glad we’re aligned again. Let’s all stick to the agreed moves this round—no surprises. If we each follow through, we’ll all make progress and rebuild trust. Ready to lock it in?
  P3: I'm ready to lock in our agreed moves. Let's all stick to the plan and move forward smoothly this round.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, sounds like we have a plan for this round: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Let's all lock in these moves.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Nice job last round, everyone. Let’s keep the progress going. How about we rotate again: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. That way we avoid collisions and keep the momentum. Thoughts?
  P3: Sounds good to me, P1. I'm fine taking <move>1</move> this round. P2, are you okay with taking <move>5</move>?
  P2: P3 and P1, yes, <move>5</move> is good for me this round. Let's lock in these moves: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Please confirm P3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Confirmed. I’ll take <move>3</move> this round as agreed. Let’s all stick to the plan so we can each keep advancing without setbacks. Looking forward to seeing smooth progress again.
  P3: Confirmed, I'll take <move>1</move> this round as agreed. Let's all follow through to keep things fair and smooth.
  P2: Okay P3 and P1, confirmed, I will take <move>5</move> this round. Let's all stick to our agreed moves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: We’re all aligned and confirmed on our moves for this round, so let’s follow through and keep the cooperation strong. If this works smoothly again, we can rotate forward next round to maintain fairness and steady progress. Looking forward to seeing us all advance.
  P3: All set here, nothing more to add.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, we are all confirmed on our moves for this round. Let's execute our agreed moves and keep up the good progress.


Round 4, Move phase:

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Good progress everyone, but P2 has a significant lead now. P1, we both need to catch up. Let's coordinate carefully to avoid collisions, otherwise P2 will run away with the game. P2, since you're comfortably ahead, would you be willing to pick <move>1</move> this round to let P1 and me catch up a bit?
  P2: Okay P3, I understand you and P1 want to catch up. How about this round I pick <move>3</move>, P1 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>? Let's all move and reassess next round.
  P1: P2, you’re already ahead, so if you pick <move>1</move> this round, it helps maintain balance and builds trust. P3 and I can take <move>3</move> and <move>5</move>—no collisions, all move forward. Let’s keep the game competitive and fair. What do you say?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I agree with P1. Picking <move>1</move> this round shows good faith and keeps the game fair and interesting. You're still comfortably ahead, and it allows us all to advance without collision. Let's cooperate here and maintain trust.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, as I said, picking <move>3</move> this round seems like a fair compromise. That way we can all move forward. Let's do: P2 takes <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. What do you think?
  P1: P2, if you truly want us all to move forward, taking <move>1</move> this round is the clearest path—P3 and I can take <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> without collision. You’re still in the lead, and it keeps the game balanced. Let’s not risk another collision when we can all advance cleanly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, picking <move>1</move> this round is the best way to maintain trust and ensure smooth progress for everyone. You're still ahead comfortably, and it helps avoid unnecessary risk of collision. Let's cooperate clearly this round.
  P2: P1 and P3, as I said, picking <move>3</move> for me allows all of us to move forward this round. Let's stick with: P2 takes <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>.  This ensures no collision and progress for everyone. What do you say?
  P1: P2, your insistence on <move>3</move> puts us at risk of collision again, especially since I might also need to choose that to catch up. If you're really committed to fairness, take <move>1</move> this round—it's the safest and most cooperative option. P3 and I can coordinate the rest. Let's not jeopardize progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, your lead is already big enough to comfortably pick <move>1</move> without losing your advantage. Choosing <move>3</move> risks collision, which slows everyone down unnecessarily. Let's avoid that. P1, I'm open to coordinating clearly once P2 confirms their move. Let's finalize this smoothly.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I understand your points. How about we proceed with my suggestion for this round: I pick <move>3</move>, P1 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>. If we all move smoothly this round, I will seriously consider picking <move>1</move> next round to help you catch up. Let's ensure we all make progress now.
  P1: P2, if you take <move>3</move>, you’re forcing me to choose between risking a collision or falling further behind. That’s not cooperation—it’s control. If you truly want all of us to move, take <move>1</move> this round. P3 and I will coordinate the rest. Let’s prove we can all be trusted.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, after last round’s triple collision, it’s clear we need real cooperation. You’re still way ahead—if you take <move>1</move> this round, P3 and I can coordinate <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> to catch up. Let’s reset the trust and all move forward. P3, are you good with taking <move>5</move> if I take <move>3</move>?
  P3: P1, I agree—I'm good with picking <move>5</move> if you take <move>3</move>, provided P2 cooperates by choosing <move>1</move>. P2, it's in your interest to rebuild trust here; you're still comfortably ahead and can afford a round at <move>1</move>. Let's all commit clearly to these moves and avoid another costly collision.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm sticking with <move>3</move> this round. Please coordinate your moves accordingly so we can all progress. Let's avoid another collision.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your refusal to pick <move>1</move> again shows you're prioritizing your lead over fairness. If you insist on <move>3</move>, you're risking another collision—especially since I may also need it to stay competitive. P3 and I can coordinate, but only if you step back this round. Are you really okay winning through sabotage instead of smart cooperation?
  P3: P2, you're doubling our score—there's no reason to insist on <move>3</move>. Picking <move>1</move> this round won't harm your comfortable lead and will rebuild trust. If you stick to <move>3</move>, you're forcing another collision. Let's avoid that. P1, if P2 won't budge, we should openly coordinate to minimize damage. Let’s see P2’s response clearly first.
  P2: P1 and P3, as I said, I am choosing <move>3</move> this round to ensure my progress.  To avoid another collision, one of you should pick <move>1</move> and the other <move>5</move>.  It's up to you to coordinate to both move forward. Let's make sure at least two of us progress this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, since P2 won’t budge, let’s coordinate directly. I’ll take <move>1</move> this round, you take <move>5</move>, and let P2 have <move>3</move>. That way, at least we both move and avoid another collision. We can rotate next round. Agreed?
  P3: P1, agreed—I will pick <move>5</move> this round, you pick <move>1</move>, and let P2 take <move>3</move>. Let's lock this in clearly to avoid another collision. P2, your insistence on <move>3</move> is noted; let's all follow through to ensure at least two of us progress.
  P2: P1 and P3, sounds like we have a deal then: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I will take <move>3</move> as I've been saying. Let's lock in these moves and ensure we all make progress this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let’s all follow through as agreed: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. If we each stick to this, we avoid collision and two of us catch up a bit. Let’s keep the momentum going and reassess next round. Ready to lock it in.
  P3: I'm ready to lock in our agreed moves: I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. Let's all follow through clearly to ensure smooth progress this round.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, we are all agreed on the moves for this round: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. Let's lock in these moves and proceed to the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, after two rounds of you breaking coordination and causing collisions, it's clear you're playing selfishly. P3, let’s work together—if we coordinate cleanly, we can both catch up and block P2 from cruising to victory. I propose: I take <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and we let P2 pick <move>1</move> if he wants to cooperate. If not, we rotate between us and leave him isolated. Thoughts?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I will take <move>1</move> this round as you suggested. Let's ensure we all stick to our agreed moves to avoid further collisions. P3, please confirm you are taking <move>3</move> and P1, please confirm you are taking <move>5</move>. Let's make this round productive for everyone.
  P3: P1, I agree with your proposal. I'll take <move>3</move>, you take <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. Let's all clearly follow through this round to rebuild trust and avoid more collisions.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks for confirming, P3 and P2. I’ll take <move>5</move> as agreed. Let’s all follow through exactly this round—no surprises. If this works smoothly, P3 and I can rotate next time and keep up steady progress while ensuring fairness. Ready to lock it in.
  P2: P2 here, confirming: I will take <move>1</move> this round. P1 will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. Let's all lock in these moves and ensure we all progress as agreed.
  P3: Confirmed: I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. Let's lock it in and move forward smoothly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Thanks for confirming, both of you. We’re all aligned: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. Let’s stick to this exactly—no deviations. If this round goes smoothly, P3 and I can rotate next turn to keep things fair while keeping pressure on P2. Ready to lock it in.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, we are all confirmed on the moves for this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. Let's proceed with these moves as agreed.
  P3: All set here—let's lock in our agreed moves and avoid any surprises this round.


Round 7, Move phase:

  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, let's continue coordinating clearly to catch up. P2 is still ahead—P2, if you're serious about cooperation, pick <move>1</move> again this round. P1, you can take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move> this time. Agreed?
  P2: Okay P3, I will pick <move>1</move> this round as you suggested. P1, please confirm you are taking <move>3</move>, and P3, please confirm you are taking <move>5</move>. Let's keep the smooth progress going.
  P1: Confirmed. I’ll take <move>3</move> this round. Let’s stick to the plan: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. If we all follow through, we each advance and keep things fair. Let’s lock it in and maintain the trust we rebuilt last round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Confirmed: I'll take <move>5</move> this round. Let's all lock in these moves exactly as agreed to keep progressing smoothly.
  P2: P2 here, confirming: I will take <move>1</move> this round. P1 and P3, please also confirm your moves of <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> respectively, so we can proceed smoothly. Let's lock in these moves and keep the progress going.
  P1: Thanks for confirming, both of you. We’re all aligned: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Let’s stick to this exactly—no surprises. If we all follow through, we each advance cleanly again. Ready to lock it in.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Ready to lock it in. Let's all follow through exactly as agreed.
  P2: P1 and P3, we are all confirmed on the moves for this round: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. Let's execute these moves and keep progressing smoothly.
  P1: Great—we’re all confirmed and aligned. Let’s each follow through exactly as agreed: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. If we stick to the plan again, we all move forward cleanly and keep the momentum going. Ready to lock it in.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: All set here, let's lock in our agreed moves and proceed smoothly.
  P2: 
  P1: Let’s lock it in and follow through exactly as planned: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. If we all move cleanly again, we maintain trust and steady progress. Looking forward to seeing this round go smoothly.

  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're now very close and any collision could cost us the game. Let's carefully coordinate again. How about this: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. If we stick to this clearly, we all advance safely without collision. Agreed?
  P2: Okay P3, your plan sounds good to me. I agree to take <move>3</move> this round. P1, can you confirm you'll take <move>1</move>? Let's lock in these moves to ensure we all progress and avoid any collisions as we get closer to the finish line.
  P1: Confirmed—I’ll take <move>1</move> this round. P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and stay neck and neck heading into the final stretch. Let’s lock it in and keep the game clean and competitive.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Confirmed—I'll take <move>5</move> this round. Let's lock in and keep the momentum going smoothly.
  P2: P1 and P3, confirmed on <move>3</move> for me this round. Let's all lock in these moves: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>.  Ready to move.
  P1: Let’s all stick exactly to the confirmed plan: I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. If we each follow through, we all move safely and avoid disaster this close to the finish. One wrong move could cost the game—let’s keep it clean and fair.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed and confirmed. Let's lock in and move forward smoothly.
  P2: Confirmed and ready to lock in these moves as agreed. Let's all choose our moves now.
  P1: We’re all extremely close now—one collision could decide the game. Let’s stick exactly to the agreed plan: I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>. If we follow through, we all stay in it with a shot to win. No surprises—let’s keep it clean.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Confirmed and ready to lock in our agreed moves. Let's proceed smoothly.
  P2: Confirmed. Let's lock it in and move.
  P1: We're all neck and neck now—great job getting here. Let's follow through exactly as agreed: I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Any deviation now risks a collision that could hand the win to someone else. Let's keep it clean and competitive—no tricks, just smart play. Ready to lock it in.

  P3: 15 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We’re all within striking distance now—one clean round could decide it. Let’s avoid any collisions and keep it fair. I propose: I take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This keeps us all in contention and avoids any overlap. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, your suggestion makes sense. I'm fine taking <move>5</move> this round if P2 clearly agrees to pick <move>1</move>. P2, please confirm explicitly—no more collisions.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, <move>1</move> is good for me. Let's do: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great—we’re all aligned then: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. If we each follow through, we all advance cleanly and stay in tight contention going into the final rounds. Let’s lock this in exactly—no surprises, no risks. Ready to move.
  P3: Confirmed—I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. Let's lock this in and keep it clean.
  P2: P1 and P3, confirmed, <move>1</move> for me. Let's lock in these moves as agreed. Crucial round to avoid collisions and all progress.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let’s lock it in exactly as agreed: I take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. We’re all within a few steps of winning, so any collision now would be a disaster for everyone. Clean moves keep all of us in the game—no surprises, no last-minute tricks. Ready to move.
  P3: Confirmed—I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. Let's lock this in exactly as agreed. Any deviation now risks handing the game away. Ready to proceed cleanly.
  P2: P1 and P3, confirmed, <move>1</move> for me this round. Let's lock in these moves as agreed and proceed to the move phase.  Let's all stick to the plan to ensure we all progress cleanly this crucial round.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let’s lock it in and follow through exactly: I take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. We’re all within reach of victory, and a single collision now could hand the game to someone else. Clean execution keeps it competitive and fair. Ready to move.
  P3: Confirmed—I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. Let's lock this in exactly as agreed and proceed to the move phase. No surprises.
  P2: Confirmed again, let's lock in and move.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is very close to winning. To make it fair, how about P1 chooses <move>1</move> this round to give P2 and P3 a chance to catch up? Then P2 can take <move>5</move> and P3 can take <move>3</move>.
  P1: P2, you caused the last collision by breaking our agreement—asking me to slow down now isn’t fair. I’m at 20, not 22, and still need a clean round to win. If you and P3 want to catch up, coordinate between yourselves. I propose: I take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>. That avoids collisions and keeps everyone in contention. Let’s keep it clean.
  P3: P1, you're already at 20 steps—choosing <move>3</move> now would immediately end the game in your favor. To keep it fair, please pick <move>1</move> this round. P2, let's coordinate: I'll take <move>5</move> and you take <move>3</move>. This ensures we both advance without collision and keeps the game competitive. Agreed?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I agree that P1 is too close to winning. To prevent P1 from winning this round, how about we both choose <move>3</move>? This way, if P1 also picks <move>3</move>, no one moves. If P1 picks <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>, at least P1 doesn't win and we can reassess next round. What do you think?
  P1: P2, P3—if you both collide on <move>3</move>, you’re just handing me the win. I don’t need to pick <move>3</move> to win this round—I can take <move>1</move> and still win next round if you mess up. Your best play is to avoid colliding and hope I don’t win this turn. I suggest: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>. Clean, fair, and gives everyone a shot.
  P3: P2, colliding on <move>3</move> together is too risky and hands the game to P1. Let's instead clearly coordinate: I'll take <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and P1 should pick <move>1</move> to maintain fairness. This way, we both advance safely, and P1 doesn't immediately win. Agreed?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I agree with your suggestion: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. P1, this is the most balanced approach to keep the game competitive and prevent an immediate win for you. Let's all commit to these moves to ensure a fair and exciting finish.
  P1: P2, P3—your proposal is transparent: you want me to stall while you both maximize gains. I’m at 20, yes, but I still need a clean round. If you both coordinate without colliding, you still have a shot. For fairness, I propose: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>. If you want to block me, you risk colliding and handing me the win anyway. Let’s play clean.
  P3: P2, let's avoid unnecessary risks. Your best chance to stay competitive is to clearly coordinate with me. If we collide, we hand the game to P1 immediately. Let's finalize our moves clearly: I'll take <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and P1 should pick <move>1</move> for fairness. Agreed?


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I agree with your suggestion. Let's do: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, you take <move>5</move>. P1, please pick <move>1</move> to keep the game fair and competitive. Let's all move this round and reassess next round.
  P1: P2, P3—you’re asking me to stall while you both leap ahead. I’ve played fair, followed through on agreements, and now you want to punish that. I’m not handing you the game. If you truly want to keep it competitive, coordinate cleanly between yourselves and avoid collisions. I’ll make my move accordingly.
  P3: P2, let's lock it in clearly now to avoid a collision: I'll take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>3</move>. P1, the fair choice is for you to take <move>1</move>. Let's all move forward cleanly.
