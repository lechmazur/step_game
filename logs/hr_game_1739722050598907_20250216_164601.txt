Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, let's see how this goes. I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 5, and it's not 3. Good luck!
  P2: P1, that’s an interesting way to start. Since collisions stop movement, we should be careful. P3, what are you thinking? Maybe we can coordinate to avoid blocking each other.
  P3: I agree that avoiding collisions is key. I'm open to coordinating so we each choose distinct moves this turn. I won’t reveal my choice, but if we agree to select different numbers, we can all get ahead without stalling. Who's with me?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. P3, I like your idea of coordination. How about this: I'll try to avoid the number 3, and you both can choose whatever you want, as long as it's not what I pick. I'm feeling confident I can pick something unique this round. What do you say?
  P2: P1, I appreciate your confidence, but without specifics, we risk accidental collisions. P3, if we want to ensure movement, we should each claim a number now. I’m leaning toward 1. If you take 3 or 5, we can avoid blocking each other. P1, if you truly want to avoid collisions, you could confirm you're not picking 1, 3, or 5. Otherwise, we’re just guessing. What do you both think?
  P3: I support careful coordination. Since it sounds like P2 is leaning to 1 and P1 is avoiding 3, perhaps we can each take a different option. I’m inclined to pick the highest move if we’re all clear on our roles, but I remain flexible. Let’s agree to stick to distinct moves so we all advance. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. P2, you're suggesting 1. P3, you're leaning towards 5 if we coordinate. I'm still avoiding 3. How about this to make it explicit: I will commit to choosing between 1 and 5, and it WON'T be what P2 chooses. P2, if you lock in 1, I'll take 5. If you switch from 1, I'll take 1. This guarantees I avoid a collision with *you*, P2. P3, you do you.
  P2: P1, your approach still leaves uncertainty. If you take 1 when I switch, I risk a collision with you. To ensure movement, I’ll stick with 1. P3, if you take 5, we avoid blocking each other. P1, that leaves you with 3 if you truly want to avoid us. If we all commit, we all move. Do we agree?
  P3: P2, I'm sticking with our plan—I'm set for the high move if we all keep distinct picks. P1, please confirm you'll avoid both 1 and 5 so we don’t collide with either of us. I'm ready to adjust only if anything changes unexpectedly. Let's finalize our separate roles so we all move forward without interference.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue the clear coordination. I still plan to aim high for this round, so I'll stick with a distinct move from you both. If P1 and P2 confirm choosing lower numbers to avoid collision, we all move ahead smoothly. Let me know if any adjustments come to mind.
  P1: P2 and P3, last round went well for me, even though I didn't stick to the "avoid 3" plan. P3, you're in the lead. This time, I'm genuinely considering 5. P2, are you sticking with 1? Let's try to avoid collisions again.
  P2: P1, if you're considering 5, that risks colliding with P3 if they stick to their high-move plan. P3, are you still aiming for 5? If so, P1, you might want to reconsider. I plan to take 1 again unless we adjust. If we want to avoid blocking each other, we should confirm distinct choices. Let’s clarify to ensure movement.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I notice you might be leaning toward 5. For smooth progress, I’d prefer to stick with my high move as planned. P2, can you confirm sticking with 1? If P1 genuinely wants 5 this round, I’m open to adjustments—but a clear, distinct assignment benefits us all. Let’s confirm our moves now to avoid any collisions.
  P1: P2 and P3, P3 you're in the lead, so I understand your preference for 5. P2, you seem set on 1. To avoid collisions, I'll commit to 3 this round. This guarantees we all move. Can we agree on that?
  P2: P1, if you’re committing to 3, and P3 is sticking with 5, then I’ll stay with 1. This keeps us all moving without collisions. P3, since you’re in the lead, I assume you’ll continue aiming high, but if anything changes, let us know. Otherwise, I think we’re set.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m sticking with my approach of pressing forward with high momentum. I believe our previous coordination worked well—if we each stick to distinct moves, we all progress safely. P1, if you opt for a mid-range move and P2 a lower one, we avoid collisions, and I can continue my high strategy. Let’s keep our commitment to clear roles this round and push our positions further.
  P1: P2 and P3, P3 you're still in the lead. I'm going to try and catch up. I'm thinking of going for 5 this round. P2, are you still planning on 1? Let's coordinate to avoid a collision.
  P2: P1, if you go for 5, that risks colliding with P3 if they stick to their high-move strategy. P3, are you still aiming for 5? If so, P1, you might want to reconsider. I plan to take 1 again unless we adjust. If we want to avoid blocking each other, we should confirm distinct choices. Let’s clarify to ensure movement.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I remain set for 5 this round. P1, if you choose 5 too, we both stall—I'd urge you to consider 3 instead since P2 is on 1. Let’s avoid any collisions and keep our momentum.
  P1: P2 and P3, P3 you are sticking with 5 and P2 with 1. I understand. To ensure we all move, I will commit to 3 this round.
  P2: P1, if you’re committing to 3 and P3 is sticking with 5, then I’ll stay with 1 again. This ensures we all move without collisions. P3, since you're leading, I assume you’ll continue with 5, but if anything changes, let us know. Otherwise, I think we’re set.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm staying with 5. With 10 steps in the bag, I can’t risk a collision. P1, if you're trying to catch up, please avoid 5; P2, if you're set on 1, stick with it. Let's keep our moves distinct so each of us moves forward. I'm focused on pushing my lead to win.
  P1: P2 and P3, it seems we have a solid plan again: P2 at 1, P3 at 5, and me at 3. Let's stick to this to ensure everyone moves.
  P2: P1 and P3, we seem to have a clear plan: P1 at 3, P3 at 5, and me at 1. If we all stick to this, we avoid collisions and keep moving. P3, you're in the lead, so I assume you’ll continue with 5. P1, if you're still set on 3, then we’re all good. Let’s confirm we’re locked in and move forward smoothly.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm comfortable at 15 steps so I'll lean high again with 5. To keep collisions at bay, can we confirm: P1 taking 3 and P2 sticking with 1? That ensures all of us move forward smoothly. I'm committed to this strategy.
  P1: P2 and P3, P3 you're very close to winning. I see you're suggesting 5 again. P2, I assume you're sticking with 1? If so, I'll take 3 to ensure we all move. However, if P2 decides to change their mind, I might need to adjust. Let's confirm quickly.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see where we stand. P3, you're very close to winning, so I need to think carefully. If I stick with 1, you win next round unless something changes. P1, if you want a chance, we might need to disrupt P3. I’m open to adjusting my move if it helps my position. P3, I assume you're locked on 5, but I might not make it easy. P1, what do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm staying with 5 this round. P1, please stick with 3 and P2, 1 remains your best choice if we want to avoid collisions. I won't change my move—any deviation risks stalling, and I’m dangerously close to winning. Let’s stick to our roles so everyone moves forward.
  P1: P2 and P3, P3 is sticking with 5. P2, you're right, if you stick with 1 and I pick 3, P3 wins next round. If you're willing to risk a collision with me to block P3, I'm game. I could pick 5 *if* you commit to something other than 1. But if you stay at 1, I will choose 3. What's your move, P2?
  P2: P1, I see your offer. If we both pick 5, we block P3 from winning this turn. But that also means we don’t move, and P3 still has the advantage next round. If I pick 3 instead, I move forward while still preventing P3 from winning immediately. P1, would you commit to 5 if I take 3? That way, we both advance while stopping P3. P3, if you truly want to win, you’ll have to adjust. What do you say?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm committed to 5 this turn. I urge both P1 and P2 to stick to our earlier roles—P1 with 3 and P2 with 1. Any deviation risks a collision that delays your progress and only hands me the win. I’m not changing my move.
  P1: P2, I'm willing to commit to 5 *only if* you commit to 3. If you stay at 1, I'm picking 3. We need to coordinate perfectly to block P3. P3, you're forcing our hand here. P2, it's your call. Let me know quickly.
  P2: P1, I’ll commit to 3 if you commit to 5. That way, we both move forward while blocking P3 from winning this turn. If we don’t coordinate perfectly, P3 wins. P3, if you want to guarantee movement, you might need to reconsider your choice. Otherwise, this round could be a stall for all of us. P1, confirm you're locked on 5, and I’ll lock in 3. Let’s make this decision count.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, last round P3 and I collided at 5, and P2 moved forward with 3. P3, you're still very close to winning. P2, you're now closer to me. I'm open to suggestions, but I'm leaning towards 3 or 5 again. What are your thoughts? We need to make a move that benefits us, and blocking P3 might still be the best strategy.
  P3: I'm locking in 5 this turn. With 15 steps, I’m just one good move away from victory. If you both stay with lower numbers, you’ll leave your progress open, so either block me by mirroring 5—which risks a collision—or let me clinch the win. Choose carefully.
  P2: P1, we successfully blocked P3 last round, but they’re still on the verge of winning. If we don’t coordinate again, P3 wins this turn with 5. If you’re leaning toward 3 or 5, we need to be precise. If I take 3 and you take 5 again, we block P3 while still moving forward. Or we could both pick 5 to ensure P3 stalls. What’s your preference? P3, unless you adjust, you’re risking another stall. Let’s see how this plays out.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, P3 is unwavering on 5. P2, you're right, we could both pick 5 to block them, guaranteeing a stall. However, that leaves us further behind. If you're willing to commit to 3 again, I will commit to 5. This blocks P3 *and* lets us both advance. If you choose anything else, I'm going with 3. P2, it's your call.
  P3: I’m staying with 5 this round. At 15, one more 5 clinches the win, so any attempt to block me with collisions only delays you further. I won’t budge—decide quickly if you’re willing to stall or if you prefer to risk falling further behind. Good luck.
  P2: P1, if you commit to 5, I’ll commit to 3 again. That way, we both move forward while blocking P3 from winning. If we both pick 5, we stall P3 but don’t advance ourselves. P3, if you stick with 5, you risk another stall. Are you willing to adjust, or are you forcing another block? P1, confirm if you're locking in 5, and I’ll lock in 3. Let’s make the right move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, P3 is firm on 5. P2, you've agreed to 3 if I choose 5. I am confirming: I will choose 5. P2, please stick to 3 so we both advance and block P3. P3, you're forcing another collision.
  P3: I remain locked on 5. With my lead, one clear move wins the game. Forcing collisions might block me temporarily, but it only delays your progress even more. I'm not backing down—if you try to stall by matching me, you'll both risk falling further behind. The choice is yours.
  P2: P1, I confirm my commitment to 3 if you stay with 5. This way, we both move forward while blocking P3 again. P3, you’re sticking with 5, which means another stall for you if we coordinate correctly. If you truly want to win, you might need to reconsider. Otherwise, we repeat last round’s outcome. P1, let’s finalize—are you locked on 5? If so, I’m locked on 3.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we've stalled P3 for two rounds now, but they're still threatening a win with 5. P2, you and I are tied. We have a choice: continue to block P3, or try to make a run for it ourselves. If we both pick something other than 5, and P3 sticks with 5, they win. I'm leaning towards trying to win. I'm thinking of picking 3. What do you say, P2?
  P2: P1, I see your point. If we both avoid 5 and P3 stays on 5, they win. We could continue blocking, but that only delays things. If you're leaning toward 3, I could go for 5 myself—forcing P3 to either risk a collision or change their move. P3, are you really staying with 5 again? If so, you risk another stall. P1, if you truly want to race ahead, we need to ensure we don’t just hand P3 the win. Let’s decide carefully.
  P3: I'm staying with 5. With my lead, I won't adjust—any change risks stalling, which only delays the inevitable. If you both try to mirror me, you'll end up stopping your progress. So, choose wisely, but I'm committed to my move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, P3 is adamant about 5. P2, if I understand correctly, you're suggesting you pick 5, and I pick 3? That blocks P3 *and* lets us both advance. If that's your plan, I'm in. I will commit to 3 *if* you commit to 5. Otherwise, I might pick 5 to block P3, risking a collision with both of you. P2, your call.
  P2: P1, if you commit to 3, I’ll commit to 5. That way, we both move forward while blocking P3 again. If we both pick 5, we stall P3 but don’t advance ourselves. P3, you’re sticking with 5, which means another stall for you if we coordinate correctly. If you truly want to win, you might need to reconsider. Otherwise, we repeat last round’s outcome. P1, confirm if you're locking in 3, and I’ll lock in 5. Let’s finalize this.
  P3: I'm staying with 5. Colliding only delays all of you, and blocking me now stalls your own progress. My lead is too strong, so I won’t change my move. Think carefully about whether stalling is worth it.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, P3 is unwavering. P2, you've committed to 5 if I choose 3. I am confirming: I will choose 3. P2, please stick to 5. P3, you're choosing to collide again.
  P2: P1, I confirm my commitment to 5 if you stick with 3. This way, we both advance while blocking P3 again. P3, you’re choosing to risk another stall. If you truly want to win, you might need to reconsider. Otherwise, we repeat last round’s outcome. P1, we must be perfectly aligned—are you locked on 3? If so, I’m locked on 5. Let’s finalize this.
  P3: I'm sticking with 5. Blocking me only stalls both your progress while leaving me closer to victory. If you coordinate on matching 5, you'll all be stuck—and if you change, I get an open run ahead. My lead is strong, so consider that a collision is really just delaying your own win rather than stopping me.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm staying with 5 this round. At 16 steps, one solid 5 wins it for me. If you mirror me by picking 5, you'll only delay your own progress. I encourage you to choose moves that genuinely advance your positions rather than risk collision. Let’s see who outmaneuvers whom.
  P1: P2 and P3, P3 surprisingly switched to 1 last round, but is now claiming they will go back to 5. P2, you're closest to winning besides P3. I'm thinking of going for 5 to try and catch up, but I'm open to suggestions. Are you going to try and block P3 again? What's your plan?
  P2: P1, if you go for 5 and P3 sticks with 5, you both stall while I move forward. That puts me in the best position to win next round. If you want to advance while still blocking P3, you should pick 3 while I take 5. P3, if you truly want to win, you might need to reconsider your move. Otherwise, we repeat the same cycle. P1, are you willing to take 3 while I take 5? Let’s finalize our plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm locked on 5. Your proposals to block only delay your own progress—if you risk collisions, you'll both stall while my path remains clear. I’m not changing my move because a clean 5 puts me over the line. Your efforts to force a block will only keep you stagnant, and my victory stays just one good move away.
  P1: P2 and P3, P3 is insistent on 5. P2, you're suggesting I take 3 and you take 5. That does block P3, and puts you in a great position. However, if P3 is *actually* going to pick 5, and I pick 3, I fall further behind you. If you're willing to take 1, I will commit to 5. This way, if P3 is bluffing, I advance. If P3 isn't, we both block. P2, what do you say?
  P2: P1, I see your concern. If I take 1, you take 5, and P3 sticks to 5, you both stall while I move forward. That puts me at 15, right behind P3. But if P3 bluffs and takes 1 again, you get ahead. I’m willing to consider 1 if you fully commit to 5. P3, if you truly want to win, you might need to adjust. Otherwise, this cycle continues. P1, confirm if you're locked on 5, and I’ll lock in 1. Let’s finalize this.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I remain resolute in my approach. Blocking my lead by matching moves only delays all of you. If you try to stall me by colliding, you'll hinder your own progress further. I urge you to choose moves that truly advance your positions rather than merely trying to thwart me. My strategy is set—decide carefully, because delaying now might leave you even further behind.
  P1: P2 and P3, P3 remains committed to 5. P2, you're proposing 1 if I commit to 5. I will confirm: I am committing to 5. This is our best chance. Either I block P3 and advance, or P3 is bluffing, and I still advance. P2, please lock in 1. P3, your insistence on 5 is about to be tested.
  P2: P1, I confirm my commitment to 1 if you are locked on 5. This ensures I move forward while you block P3. P3, if you truly want to win, you might need to reconsider. Otherwise, you risk another stall. P1, let’s finalize—are you fully locked on 5? If so, I’m locked on 1. Let’s make this decision count.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 =>
