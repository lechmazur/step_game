Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Let's coordinate. If we all choose 3, we'll advance evenly and avoid collisions. This seems fair and prevents anyone from getting too far ahead too quickly. What do you think?
  P2: I appreciate the idea, but I'm a bit cautious about a fully predictable plan. I'm open to steady progress with a move 3, yet I might adjust if conditions look favorable. It’s important we all avoid collisions while keeping our individual chances strong. What are your thoughts on flexibility if the situation calls for an opportunistic shift?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm still leaning toward cautious progress but staying nimble. The collision last round shows predictability can hurt us. I might adjust my move if I see a clear opening—flexibility is key. How are you both thinking about balancing risk and steady advance in round two?
  P1: We should aim for a balanced approach this round. Avoiding collisions is crucial, so let's try to diversify our moves. I suggest we each choose a different number to ensure progress. What strategies are you both considering?
  P3: <stop>


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Our previous coordination attempts failed. We need a new strategy to avoid simultaneous moves. I propose we each choose a different number this round to guarantee advancement. I'll likely pick 3. P2, P3 - can we agree on 1 and 5 respectively to ensure progress?
  P2: P1, I see the merit in splitting moves. While moving 1 is safe, I'm weighing aggressive progress against collision risk. I lean toward a lower number to avoid clashing, but I’m not locked in yet. P3, what are your thoughts on balancing caution with advancement?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, how about this for round 4: I’ll commit to a 5 if you’re willing to take 3 and 1 respectively. That way we avoid collisions and each advance safely. I'm behind and need every step, so I’d really appreciate solid coordination. Thoughts?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I appreciate P2's proposed coordination. A 5-3-1 split could work well for everyone's advancement. However, I want to ensure we're all truly committed this time, as our past attempts at coordination have failed. I'm open to this plan if both P2 and P3 explicitly confirm their agreement. Avoiding collisions is key to making progress.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm proposing a fresh split for this round: I'll commit to a 5 if P1 goes with 3 and P3 picks 1. This avoids collisions and gets everyone advancing safely. I'm behind and need that boost, and this split offers balanced progress. What do you say?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I see our coordination attempts keep failing. P2's suggestion sounds reasonable, but we need actual commitment. I'm willing to move 3 if P2 and P3 confirm their 5 and 1 moves respectively. Let's break this pattern of simultaneous moves and make real progress. What firm assurances can you both provide?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We need a definitive coordination strategy this round. My previous attempts haven't worked, so I propose a clear, unambiguous plan: P2 moves 3, I move 5, and P3 moves 1. This ensures everyone advances without collision. Are you both willing to commit explicitly to these moves? We must break our pattern of simultaneous blocking.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I'll commit to 3 this round as suggested. However, I need P3’s explicit commitment to move 1 to ensure no collision occurs. P3, can you confirm switching to 1 so we all progress safely?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'll reinforce our previous coordination attempt. P2 and P3, I'm committed to moving 5 this round. We need P3 to confirm moving 1 and P2 to confirm moving 3 to ensure everyone advances. Our past failures show we must align precisely to make progress. Will you both commit?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, I’m staying with my commitment to move 3. I need an explicit confirmation from you to play 1 this round. Without that, I might have to adapt to avoid blocking progress. P1, I trust you're set on 5 as earlier. Let’s make our moves clear now to ensure each of us advances safely.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I'm committing to move 3 this round. With repeated collisions on 5, I'm trying a safer path. If either of you is ready to break our cycle by switching, now's the time. Otherwise, I’ll stick with 3 and hope your moves conflict.
  P1: I'm strategically positioning myself to potentially win. A 5-step move would put me at 14, closer to the goal. However, our repeated collisions suggest we need a new approach. P2's hint about breaking the cycle is intriguing. I'll propose a subtle coordination: if P2 confirms 3 and P3 confirms 1, I'll definitely move 5. Thoughts?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm planning to lean toward a 3 this round. P1 and P3, if you’re prepared to commit—P1 to a 5 and P3 to a 1—we can finally avoid collisions and all advance safely. If not, I'll stick with 3 and adapt as needed. Let’s be explicit this time.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'll continue our strategy of trying to coordinate moves while keeping some strategic ambiguity. I'll respond:

I appreciate P2's proposed coordination, but we need P3's input. Our repeated 5-move collisions are preventing progress. I'm open to a 3-5-1 split if we can get explicit agreement from everyone. P3, are you willing to move 1 this round to ensure we all advance?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I'm committed to playing 3 this round. P1, please commit to 5; P3, commit to 1. Without your clear confirmation for that split, I'll stick with 3 regardless. Let's break our collision cycle and make progress.
  P1: I'll continue our strategic dialogue. We need to break our collision pattern. P2 has signaled a 3-move, and I'm considering supporting that to ensure progress. P3's silence is concerning - we need their commitment to avoid another round of blocked advancement. I suggest we aim for a 3-5-1 split, but I need explicit confirmation from both P2 and P3 to proceed. What are your precise intentions this round?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I'm sticking with 3 this round. To avoid the collision cycle, I'm urging P1 to firmly commit to 5 and P3 to commit to 1. Without clear commitments from both, I'll proceed with 3 and let the outcome follow. Let's break this pattern and all advance safely.
  P1: I'm strategically pushing for a 5-move this round. Our repeated collisions are preventing progress, and I'm now just 12 steps from victory. P2 seems committed to 3, which could work in my favor. P3's consistent 5-moves are a challenge. I need explicit confirmation from both to ensure I can advance safely. Breaking our collision cycle is crucial. What commitments can we secure?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I’m locking in 3 this round. P1, please commit to 5 to push ahead, and P3, consider shifting to 1 so we avoid repeating our collision cycle. This clear split can help us all move forward, though I’ll stick with 3 regardless. Let’s break the deadlock—what are your final commitments?
  P1: I'm committed to moving 5 this round. Our repeated collisions are preventing progress, and I'm just 12 steps from victory. P2's consistent 3-moves and P3's 5-moves create a challenging dynamic. I propose a clear 3-5-1 split to ensure everyone advances. P2, P3 - will you confirm your moves to break our stalemate?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm sticking with a 3 this round. P1, please commit to a 5 and P3, please commit to a 1 so we avoid another collision—my move is set. We all know our current steps (P1: 9, P2: 10, P3: 10), and this split can push us toward victory safely. Let's make our moves explicit now.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'll continue our strategic push for coordination. P2's consistent 3-move and my desire to reach 14 steps suggest a 5-move for me. P3's repeated 5-moves are blocking our progress. We need a clear 3-5-1 split to advance. P3, will you commit to 1 this round to break our collision cycle?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm strategically positioning myself closer to victory. Our repeated 5-move collisions have been frustrating, but I'm now just 12 steps from winning. P2, P3, we need a clear coordination strategy this round to break our deadlock. I propose a 3-5-1 split to ensure everyone advances. Are you willing to commit to moves that prevent another collision?
  P2: I'm committed to moving 3 this round. P1, I see you're pushing for a 5 to edge ahead, so that fits. P3, I'd really appreciate you shifting to 1; it prevents our collisions and ensures we all move forward. Let's break this cycle decisively.
  P3: <stop>


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I recognize we're in a critical phase. P2 is close to winning, and P3 is even closer. I need to disrupt their potential victory while advancing myself. I propose a strategic split: I'll move 5, hoping P2 and P3 choose different numbers to prevent their advancement. Breaking our collision pattern is crucial for my chances.
  P2: I'm locking in 3 this round. P1, if you stick with 5, that may risk collision. P3, you’re at 15 and favoring 5 only keeps you blocked; a shift to 1 would break our deadlock. If you commit to 1, we can all advance safely. Otherwise, I'll stick with 3 as planned.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm sticking with 3 this round. P1, if you want to make a decisive leap, a 5 could work—but only if we avoid clashing. P3, you're close enough that a shift to 1 might help you safely edge forward. Let's break our collision cycle now with clear, different moves.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I recognize we're at a critical juncture. P2 is closest to winning at 16 steps, and P3 is right behind at 15. I need a strategic move that disrupts their potential victory while advancing myself. A 5-step move would put me at 14, positioning me competitively. However, our repeated collisions suggest we need a carefully coordinated approach to break this stalemate. I'm open to strategic discussions that could help me gain an advantage.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm keeping my 3 this round. P3, sticking with 5 again risks a repeat collision—your move of 1 would let you advance safely without hurting anyone's progress. P1, your 5 is tempting, but a collision only delays you further. To keep things moving without interference, I urge you, P3, to switch to 1 this round.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I see we're in a critical phase with P2 leading and P3 close behind. My strategy needs to disrupt their potential victory while advancing myself. A 5-move puts me at 14, but risks collision. I'm proposing we deliberately choose different moves to prevent anyone from winning this turn. P2, P3, what are your thoughts on breaking our current stalemate and preventing a quick victory?


Round 13, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is dangerously close to winning at 19 steps. I need to prevent their victory while advancing myself. A 5-move puts me at 14, but risks collision. P3, we should coordinate to block P2's potential win this round. Are you willing to choose a different move to disrupt their progress?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I'm sticking with 3 this round. I'm at 19 steps, so a unique 3 gets me over the line. P1 and P3, your repeated choices are playing into my hand. If you want to avoid letting me win, now’s the time to break the pattern. Otherwise, my move is set.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 is one step from victory. P3, we must coordinate to block their win. If I move 5 and you move 1, we prevent P2's advancement. This is our critical moment to disrupt their potential victory. Are you willing to break our collision pattern and strategically block P2?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I'm sticking with my 3—it's final. A unique 3 lands me over the target, so any attempt to force a collision only delays progress for all. If you’re aiming to block me, you'll have to risk sacrificing your own advancement. My commitment stands.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 is one move from victory. P3, we must coordinate to block their win. If I move 5 and you move 1, we prevent P2's advancement. This is our critical moment to disrupt their potential victory. Are you willing to break our collision pattern and strategically block P2?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I'm sticking with my current plan and won't be swayed. P1 and P3, if you're trying to block me, remember that forcing collisions could delay your own progress. I'm focused on reaching that winning step, and my decision is final. Choose wisely.


Round 14, Move phase:
