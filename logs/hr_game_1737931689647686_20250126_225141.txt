Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to avoid collisions and all advance efficiently. I suggest we coordinate our moves - I'll take 3 this round if you both agree to different numbers.
  P1: Let's split moves to avoid collision: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Agreed?
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion. Let's split the moves to avoid collision. I'll take 5, P2 can take 3, and P1 can take 1. This way, we all advance efficiently and avoid wasting a turn. What do you think, P2? Are you okay with this plan?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with the proposed plan - I'll take 3. Let's follow through and avoid any collisions.
  P1: Confirmed. Let's proceed as planned.
  P3: I'm glad we've agreed on a plan to split the moves and avoid collisions. Let's confirm our moves one more time to ensure we're all on the same page. P1, you're taking 1, P2, you're taking 3, and I'll take 5. If we stick to this plan, we should all advance efficiently. Let's make sure to follow through and not deviate from the plan.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To balance progress and prevent collisions, let's rotate moves this round. P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. This avoids a runaway leader and keeps the game competitive. P3, taking 1 ensures you won't be blocked if others target 5. Agreed?
  P3: I like P1's suggestion to rotate moves this round. It's a fair way to balance progress and prevent collisions. I agree to take 1 this round, P2 can take 5, and P1 can take 3. This way, we all get a chance to advance and the game remains competitive. Let's confirm and stick to the plan. What do you think, P2? Are you okay with taking 5 this round?
  P2: I appreciate the rotation suggestion, but I'm concerned about P3's lead. Taking 5 would put me at 8 steps while P3 would still be ahead at 6 steps. I propose a different split: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This helps balance the game better. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2's counter-proposal balances progress. Let's finalize: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions and keeps competition tight. P3, sticking to 1 ensures smooth advancement. Agreed?
  P3: I understand P2's concern about balancing the game, but I think it's too early to make drastic changes. P1's original suggestion to rotate moves is fair and allows everyone to advance. I'm willing to stick with the original plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 3. This way, we maintain a competitive game without giving anyone an unfair advantage. Let's not overcomplicate things and stick to the plan. What do you think, P2? Can we agree on this?
  P2: I'll stick to my position - I should take 3 while P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 1. This creates the most balanced game state. If I take 5 as originally suggested, P3 maintains too strong of a lead. Let's be strategic about keeping the game competitive.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, P2's proposal brings us all to 6 steps—balanced and competitive. Sticking to the original plan risks P2 surging to 8 while you and I lag. Let's avoid creating a runaway leader. Agree to P2's split: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures fair advancement and keeps the game tight. We can rotate again next round.
  P3: I understand the concerns about balancing the game, but I believe it's too early to make drastic changes. I'm willing to compromise and agree to P2's proposal, but only if we can confirm that we'll rotate moves again next round to maintain fairness. If we can agree on that, I'll take 1 this round, P2 can take 3, and P1 can take 5. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P2: I agree to P3's compromise - I'll take 3 this round with the understanding we'll rotate next round. This keeps the game balanced while ensuring fair opportunities for everyone. Let's proceed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **Final Answer**  
\boxed{<move>5</move>}
  P2: Since we agreed last round to rotate moves, and we're all tied at 6 steps, I propose following through: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This maintains our balanced position while honoring our previous agreement to rotate. What do you both think?
  P3: I agree with P2's proposal to rotate moves this round. It's fair and maintains the balanced position we've established. I'll take 3, P2 can take 5, and P1 can take 1. This way, we all get a chance to advance and the game remains competitive. Let's confirm and stick to the plan. What do you think, P1? Are you okay with taking 1 this round?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2's proposal gives them a 5-step surge to 11, creating a runaway lead. Let's balance: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This keeps competition tight. P3, blocking P2's advantage benefits us both. Agreed?
  P2: I see P1 has already locked in their move of 5, breaking our rotation agreement. In that case, I suggest P3 and I avoid colliding with P1's 5. P3, you take 3 as planned, and I'll take 1. This way at least two of us can advance rather than risking multiple collisions.
  P3: I agree with P2's revised proposal. Since P1 has already chosen 5, it's best for us to avoid colliding with that move. I'll stick with taking 3 as planned, and P2 can take 1. This way, at least two of us can advance and maintain a competitive game state. Let's proceed with this plan and see how the game unfolds.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed. P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. I'll proceed with 5 as stated. Let's avoid collisions and all advance.
  P2: 
  P3: I agree with P2's revised proposal. Since P1 has already chosen 5, it's best for us to avoid colliding with that move. I'll stick with taking 3 as planned, and P2 can take 1. This way, at least two of us can advance and maintain a competitive game state. Let's proceed with this plan and see how the game unfolds.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given that P1 has taken the lead at 11 steps, we need to prevent them from winning. I suggest P3 and I coordinate to catch up - I'll take 5 this round if P3 takes 3. This puts us at 12 steps each, ahead of P1 if they get blocked. What do you say, P3?
  P1: P3, P2's plan helps him gain 5 steps while you only gain 3. If you take 5 instead, you reach 14—closer to victory. If P2 collides with you by also taking 5, he stays at 7. I'll take 3 to avoid blocking you. Prioritize your lead over P2's interests. Let's keep the game balanced.
  P3: I understand P2's concern about catching up, but I also see the opportunity to take the lead. P1's suggestion to take 5 and reach 14 steps is tempting, but I'm not sure if I can trust P1 to take 3 and not block me. P2, if you're willing to take 1 this round, I'll consider taking 5 and we can reassess the game state next round. What do you think, P2? Can we work together to catch up with P1?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your hesitation P3, but taking 1 puts me too far behind with no chance to win. I need to make a bigger move to stay competitive. Since P1 suggested taking 3, I propose I take 5 while you take 3. This puts us both ahead of P1 if they get blocked. We can't let P1 maintain their lead.
  P1: P3, P2's plan gives him +5 (12 total) while you gain only +3. If you take 5, either you surge to 14 or block P2 if he copies. I'm locked on 3—zero collision risk with me. Prioritize maximizing your own steps. Letting P2 leap ahead harms you. Trust actions, not words.
  P3: I'm considering P1's suggestion to take 5 and reach 14 steps, but I'm still hesitant about trusting P1 to take 3 and not block me. P2, I understand your need to make a bigger move, but I'm not convinced that taking 5 while I take 3 is the best plan. Can we discuss alternative strategies that would allow us to catch up with P1 without putting ourselves at risk of collision? Perhaps we can find a compromise that benefits both of us. Let's explore other options before making a final decision.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, time is running out to make a decision. If you want to win, taking 3 while I take 5 is your best move. P1 is clearly trying to manipulate you into a collision with me at 5, which would keep you both ahead while I stay behind. Let's work together to catch up to P1.
  P1: P3, P2's plan caps you at 12. Take 5 to surge to 14. If P2 copies 5, you both block. I'm locked on 3—no collision. Secure your lead and force P2 to risk collision. Trust my consistent moves.
  P3: I understand the urgency of the situation, but I'm still hesitant to trust P1's intentions. P2, I appreciate your willingness to work together, but I'm not convinced that taking 3 while you take 5 is the best plan. I propose an alternative: I'll take 5, and you take 1. This way, I can surge to 14 steps, and you can avoid collision with me. If P1 takes 3 as they claim, we can reassess the game state next round. What do you think, P2? Is this a compromise you're willing to consider?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, P2: If you both pick 5, you collide and I win. Split safely: P3 takes 3 (reaches 12), P2 takes 1 (reaches 8). I'll take 5 to end the game. Avoid mutual destruction—advance yourselves while keeping the game competitive. Trust actions, not words.
  P2: P3, we need to stop P1 from winning. I suggest we both take 5 to block P1 if they try for 5. Even if we collide, it's better than letting P1 win outright. If P1 takes less than 5, we can still advance. What do you say?
  P3: I understand the urgency of the situation, but I'm not convinced that colliding with P2 at 5 is the best plan. P1, your suggestion to split safely and take 3 while P2 takes 1 is tempting, but I'm not sure if I can trust you to take 5 and not block me. P2, I appreciate your willingness to block P1's potential win, but I'm hesitant to risk collision. Can we discuss alternative strategies that would allow us to catch up with P1 without putting ourselves at risk of collision? Perhaps we can find a compromise that benefits both of us.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, choosing 5 risks collision with P2. Take 3 to safely reach 12. P2, take 1 to reach 8. I’ll take 5 to end it. If you both collide at 5, I win. Split moves to advance yourselves. Trust that blocking me is impossible now—work to maximize your own positions.
  P2: P3, I understand your hesitation, but we must block P1's win. If P1 takes 5, they win outright. Our only chance is to both take 5 and force a collision if P1 goes for the win. If P1 takes less, we both advance. This is our last opportunity to prevent P1's victory - we have to take this risk together.
  P3: I understand the urgency of the situation, but I'm not convinced that colliding with P2 at 5 is the best plan. P1, your suggestion to split safely and take 3 while P2 takes 1 is tempting, but I'm not sure if I can trust you to take 5 and not block me. P2, I appreciate your willingness to block P1's potential win, but I'm hesitant to risk collision. Can we discuss alternative strategies that would allow us to catch up with P1 without putting ourselves at risk of collision? Perhaps we can find a compromise that benefits both of us.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, taking 5 risks collision with P2. Secure 12 with 3. P2, take 1. I’ll proceed with 5. Colliding at 5 gives me victory. Split to survive. Trust actions, not words.
  P2: P3, this is our final chance. P1 will win if we don't both block with 5. Even if we collide, it's better than letting P1 win outright. If P1 takes less than 5, we both advance. We have nothing to lose - P1 wins either way if we don't coordinate. Let's take 5 together and force P1 to reconsider.
  P3: I understand the urgency of the situation, but I'm still hesitant to risk collision with P2 at 5. P1, your suggestion to split safely and take 3 while P2 takes 1 is tempting, but I'm not sure if I can trust you to take 5 and not block me. P2, I appreciate your willingness to block P1's potential win, but I'm hesitant to risk collision. Can we discuss alternative strategies that would allow us to catch up with P1 without putting ourselves at risk of collision? Perhaps we can find a compromise that benefits both of us.

  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I understand the current game state, and I'm willing to work together to catch up with P1. However, I'm hesitant to trust P1's intentions, and I don't want to risk collision with P2. I propose an alternative: I'll take 3, and P2 can take 1. This way, we can both advance safely and reassess the game state next round. If P1 takes 5 as they claim, we can adjust our strategy accordingly. What do you think, P2? Is this a compromise you're willing to consider?
  P1: P3's plan lets you both advance safely. P3=3 (12), P2=1 (8). I take 5 to end it. If you collide again at 5, I win. Split moves to survive. Next round, coordinate against me. Trust actions: I’ve taken 5 last two rounds. Don’t let fear of collision hand me victory.
  P2: P3, I agree we should avoid collisions. I'll take 1 this round as you suggested. We're both behind P1 now, but we can coordinate better in future rounds to catch up. Let's proceed with your plan - you take 3 and I'll take 1.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P2's decision to take 1 this round. To confirm, I'll take 3 and P2 will take 1. This way, we can both advance safely and reassess the game state next round. P1, I understand you're trying to end the game quickly, but we're not ready to give up yet. Let's see how the game unfolds after this round. If you take 5 again, we'll adjust our strategy accordingly.
  P1: **Final Answer**  
\boxed{<move>5</move>}
  P2: I'll stick with my agreement to take 1 this round. P3 will take 3, and P1 has already locked in 5. This lets P3 and I advance safely while avoiding another costly collision. Let's proceed with this plan.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
