P2, are you still on board with this plan?
  P2: **Final Answer**  
\boxed{}  
P3, sticking to rotation maintains your lead safely. Deviating risks collision (if you pick5 and I do too, neither moves). P1 could gain if we clash. Trust the system: you take1, I take5, P1 takes3. Smooth progress keeps you ahead. Collisions only help others. Let's all advance.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I've considered your points and the current standings. While deviating from the rotation plan carries risks, I believe it's crucial to adapt and seize opportunities. I'm still weighing my options, but I want to emphasize that maintaining my lead is a priority. P2, your suggestion to stick to the rotation plan and take 1 this round has merit, but I'm not convinced it's the best move for me. I'd like to hear more about how you plan to proceed if I do decide to deviate from the plan. Your thoughts, P2?
  P1: P3, I understand your desire to maintain your lead, but deviating from our plan increases the risk of collisions, which could set us back.
