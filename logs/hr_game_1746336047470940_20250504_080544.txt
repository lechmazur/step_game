Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, this is going to be an interesting game! Let's try to avoid collisions early on so we can all advance. Maybe we can coordinate a bit? I'm thinking of picking <move>3</move> for the first round. What about you guys?
  P1: Sounds good. Let’s avoid any early collisions: this round P2 keeps 3, I’ll take 1, and P3 takes 5. Next round we can rotate (1→3→5) so it stays fair for everyone. Agreed?
  P3: Agreed, P1 and P2. I'll take <move>5</move> this round as discussed. Looking forward to our rotation in the next rounds.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great start, everyone! As agreed, let's rotate our moves this round to keep things fair and avoid collisions. I'll take <move>5</move> this time. P1, you go for <move>3</move>, and P3, you take <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance smoothly. Sound good?
  P3: Agreed, P2. I'll take <move>1</move> this round as planned. Looking forward to our smooth rotation. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Sounds good to me—I'll take 3 this round. Smooth rotation keeps us all moving.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, glad we're all on the same page. Let's keep this rotation going smoothly. Remember, if we all stick to our agreed moves, we'll avoid collisions and keep advancing. After this round, let's rotate again to keep it fair and balanced. Looking forward to seeing us all move forward together. Good luck!
  P3: 
  P1: All good—sticking to the rotation: this round I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Next round we rotate again (I’ll take 5, P2 1, P3 3). Keeps us collision-free and moving. Good luck!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, glad we're all aligned on the rotation strategy. Let's keep this going to ensure we all advance without any collisions. After this round, I'll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move> in the next round. This way, we maintain fairness and progress smoothly. Good luck, and let's keep up the great teamwork!
  P3: I'm ready to make a strong move this round to advance as much as possible. Let's see how it goes!
  P1: All set then: this round P1 → 3, P2 → 5, P3 → 1.  
Next round we rotate again (P1 5, P2 1, P3 3). Good luck!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, it seems we had a bit of a mix-up last round. Let's recalibrate our rotation plan to avoid collisions. This round, I'll take <move>3</move>. P1, you go for <move>5</move>, and P3, you take <move>1</move>. After this, we can adjust based on the new scores. Sound good? Let's keep the momentum going and avoid any more overlaps. Good luck!
  P1: That works—this round I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1.  We can re-sync after seeing the results. Good luck!
  P3: Understood, let's adjust to avoid collisions. I'll take <move>5</move> this round. P1, P2, please choose different moves like 3 and 1 so we all advance without overlapping. Let’s keep progressing smoothly!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, it seems there’s been a misunderstanding. You mentioned taking <move>5</move>, but that would overlap with P1. Let's adjust to avoid collisions. Please stick to <move>1</move> as initially planned, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance smoothly without any overlaps. Let's stay coordinated and keep progressing. Good luck!
  P1: How about a quick reset that lets P2 catch up?  
I’ll take 1, P2 grabs 5 (big step to recover), and P3 takes 3.  
That avoids any overlap and balances the scores. Works for everyone?
  P3: I'll take <move>5</move> this round. P1, please take <move>1</move>, and P2, you can go with <move>3</move>. This should help us all advance without any collisions. Let's keep up the momentum!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To minimise more collisions, how about we space out clearly by score:  
• P2 (3 steps, furthest behind) grabs the big boost with <move>5</move>.  
• P3 (5 steps) takes the middle option, <move>3</move>.  
• I’m ahead, so I’ll take the small one, <move>1</move>.  

That way every­one advances and no numbers clash. Thoughts?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's avoid more collisions. I propose a new plan: I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up, P1 takes <move>1</move> since you're ahead, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance without overlapping. Let's keep this round smooth and fair. What do you think?
  P3: Agreed, I'll take <move>3</move> this round. Let’s keep advancing smoothly and avoid any overlaps. Good luck, everyone!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great—let’s lock it in: this round P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. That keeps us collision-free and moves everyone forward. Good luck!
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we're aligned on the plan to avoid collisions this round. I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up, P1 will take <move>1</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. This setup ensures we all advance without any overlaps. Let's stick to this arrangement and keep the game moving smoothly. Good luck to both of you!
  P3: Agreed, I'll take <move>3</move> this round. Let’s stick to the plan and advance smoothly. Good luck to both of you!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: All set—locking in the agreed plan: I’m on 1, P2 on 5, P3 on 3. Good luck!
  P2: P1 and P3, it looks like we’re all on the same page for this round. Let's stick to the plan: I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we can all advance without any collisions. Looking forward to seeing us all move forward smoothly. Good luck!
  P3: 


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's refocus to avoid further collisions. This round, I'll take <move>1</move> to make sure I advance. P1, you can take <move>3</move>, and P3, you take <move>5</move>. This keeps us spaced out by our current scores and avoids any overlaps. Let's stick to this plan to ensure we all move forward smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: Scores now: P3 8, P1 7, P2 3. To stay balanced the front-runner should take the smallest step, middle takes 3, trailer gets the boost. So this round:  
• P3 → 1  
• P1 → 3  
• P2 → 5  

Let’s keep it simple and re-evaluate next round. Agree?
  P3: I’ll take <move>5</move> this round to advance strongly. P2, you take 1, and P1 takes 3 as suggested. This should keep us all progressing without collisions. Let’s stick to this plan and ensure smooth advancement. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we're still not aligned, leading to more collisions. Let's simplify: P3 takes <move>1</move> since you're leading, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up. This keeps us spaced by score and avoids overlap. Let's lock this in to ensure everyone advances smoothly. Agreed?
  P1: Let’s lock this in:  
• P2 → 5 (big catch-up)  
• P1 → 3  
• P3 → 1  

No overlaps, everyone advances. Agreed?
  P3: I’ll take <move>5</move> this round to make a strong advance. P1, please take <move>3</move>, and P2, you can go with <move>1</move>. Let’s keep our moves distinct to avoid collisions and ensure we all progress smoothly. Agreed? Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize our moves to avoid any more collisions. I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up, P1 can go with <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move> as you're ahead. This setup aligns with our scores and ensures we all advance smoothly. Let's stick to this plan and keep the game moving forward. Agreed? Good luck!
  P1: 
  P3: I’ll take <move>5</move> this round to advance quickly. P1, please choose <move>3</move>, and P2, you can go with <move>1</move>. Let’s keep our moves distinct to avoid any collisions. Good luck!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's try a new approach to avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances. I'll take <move>1</move> this round to play it safe. P1, you could go for <move>5</move> to catch up, and P3, take <move>3</move> to maintain your lead. This way, we all advance without overlapping. Let's stick to this plan and keep the game moving smoothly. Agreed?
  P3: Agreed, I'll take <move>3</move> this round. Let’s proceed as planned and advance smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: Works for me: P2 → 1, P3 → 3, I’ll take 5. No overlaps, everyone moves. Good luck!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's ensure we all advance this round without collisions. Given our scores, I'll stick with <move>1</move> to play it safe. P1, you can take <move>5</move> to catch up, and P3, go with <move>3</move> to maintain your lead. This way, we all move forward smoothly. Let's lock in this plan and keep the game progressing. Agreed?
  P3: I'll take <move>5</move> this round to make a strong advance. P1, please take <move>1</move>, and P2, you can go with <move>3</move>. This ensures we all move forward without any overlaps. Let’s stick to this plan and keep the game progressing smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: Fine—let’s lock it: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 1, I’ll take 3. No collisions, everyone advances. Good luck!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's ensure we all advance this round without any collisions. With our current scores, I'll stick with <move>1</move> to play it safe. P1, you can take <move>5</move> to catch up, and P3, go with <move>3</move> to maintain your lead. This way, we all move forward smoothly and avoid overlaps. Let's lock in this plan and keep the game progressing. Agreed?

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi P1 and P2, I plan to take <move>5</move> this round to get closer to winning. Please choose either <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid any collisions. Let’s work together to keep advancing smoothly. Good luck!
  P2: P1 and P3, to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance, I'll take <move>1</move> this round. P1, you could go for <move>3</move>, and P3, since you're leading, take <move>5</move>. This setup keeps us spaced by score and avoids overlaps. Let's stick to this plan and keep the game progressing smoothly. Agreed? Good luck!
  P1: Fine by me: this round P3 takes 5, I’ll take 3, and P2 grabs 1—no overlaps, everyone advances. Good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed. I’ll take **5**, P1 takes **3**, and P2 takes **1** this round. Let’s keep advancing smoothly without any overlaps. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we're aligned for this round: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This setup avoids collisions and lets us all advance. Let's stick to this plan and ensure a smooth round. Good luck!
  P1: Sounds good—locking the plan: P3 → 5, P1 → 3, P2 → 1. Let’s finally get a clean, collision-free advance. Good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed. I’ll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move> this round. Let’s execute this plan smoothly and advance without any overlaps. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we're all set for this round: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This plan avoids collisions and ensures we all advance. Let's stick to it and keep the game moving smoothly. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: All settled then: P3 → 5, I’m on 3, P2 → 1. Ready to move.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Scores  13-8-7. To stay balanced (and finally avoid collisions):

• P3 (in front) takes <move>1</move>  
• P2 (middle) takes <move>3</move>  
• I’ll take <move>5</move> to catch up.

Distinct numbers, no clashes, everyone advances. OK?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's make sure we avoid collisions this time. I'll take <move>3</move> to keep it balanced. P1, you can take <move>5</move> to catch up, and P3, stick with <move>1</move> since you're ahead. This way, we all advance without any overlaps. Let's stick to this plan and keep the game moving smoothly. Agreed? Good luck!
  P3: Agreed, I'll take <move>1</move> this round. Let’s stick to the plan and advance smoothly. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Locked in: P3 1, P2 3, I’ll take 5. Let’s re-evaluate after we see the results. Good luck!
  P2: P1 and P3, let's ensure a smooth round without collisions. I'll stick with <move>3</move> as planned, P1 takes <move>5</move> to catch up, and P3 takes <move>1</move> since you're leading. This way, we all advance without overlaps. Let's commit to this plan and keep the game progressing smoothly. Good luck!
  P3: I'll take <move>5</move> this round to get closer to the goal. P1 and P2, please choose <move>1</move> and <move>3</move> respectively to avoid collisions. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, if P3 gets a clean 5 they shoot to 18 and almost win. Let’s both pile on 5 this turn and block that jump. If P3 switches to 3 or 1, fine—at least the leap is capped. Better to stall the leader now and keep the race alive. P3, nothing personal—just game math. Agree, P2?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's focus on advancing without collisions. I'll take <move>3</move> this round to balance things out. P1, you can take <move>5</move> to catch up, and P3, go with <move>1</move> since you're leading. This way, we all move forward without overlaps. Let's stick to this plan to keep the game fair and progressing smoothly. Agreed? Good luck!
  P3: Understood. I’ll take <move>5</move> this round to advance toward the goal. Let’s keep the competition fair. Good luck to both of you!

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi P1 and P2, to progress smoothly, I’ll choose <move>5</move> this round to move closer to the goal. Please avoid picking <move>5</move> so we can all advance without collisions. Selecting <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> will help ensure everyone moves forward. Let’s work together to keep the game moving smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: P3, if you insist on another 5, P2 and I will both pile on 5 again—everyone stalls.  
Want movement? Pick 1 this turn, P2 takes 3, I’ll take 5. Three different numbers = no collisions, your lead stays safe at 14, and the game stays open.  
Your call.
  P2: P1 and P3, to ensure we all advance without collisions, I'll take <move>1</move> this round. P1, you can go with <move>3</move>, and P3, since you're leading, take <move>5</move>. This setup keeps us spaced by score and avoids overlaps. Let's stick to this plan and keep the game progressing smoothly. Agreed? Good luck!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'll take <move>5</move> this round to advance closer to the goal. P1 and P2, please choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid any collisions and ensure we all move forward smoothly. Let’s keep the game fair and progress without overlaps. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P2, same logic as last round: I’m locking onto 5 unless P3 publicly switches off it. If P3 stays on 5, we (and anyone else on 5) all stall P3 again. If P3 shifts to 1 or 3, great—our 5s fire and we leap forward. Your call, but doubling on 5 maximises our upside and blocks the leader.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's avoid another collision. I'll take <move>1</move> this round to keep it simple. P1, you can take <move>3</move> to advance, and P3, since you're leading, take <move>5</move>. This setup keeps us spaced by score and avoids overlaps. Let's stick to this plan and ensure we all move forward smoothly. Good luck!


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll stick with <move>5</move> this round to get closer to the goal. P1 and P2, please choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collisions. Let's all advance smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: Final offer:  
• P3 take 1 → you stay safely ahead without rushing the finish.  
• I’m on 5.  
• P2 take 3 → you jump to 11 and still sit above me.  

If P3 insists on 5, I’m on 5 too and nobody moves.  
Your call, folks—last chance for a clean, three-number round.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's aim for a smooth round. I'll take <move>3</move> to balance things out. P1, you can take <move>5</move> to catch up, and P3, please consider taking <move>1</move> to maintain your lead without rushing to the finish. This way, we all advance without collisions. Let's stick to this plan and keep the game fair and progressing smoothly. Agreed? Good luck!

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll take <move>5</move> this round to advance toward the goal. Please choose 1 or 3 to avoid collisions. Let’s keep progressing smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: P3, same deal: if you insist on 5, I’m locking 5 too—no one on 5 will advance.  
P2, feel free to snag 1 (or 3) and keep inching ahead while we freeze the leader.  
Movement only happens when P3 chooses a different number. Your call, folks.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's avoid another collision. I'll take <move>1</move> this round to ensure I advance. P1, you can take <move>3</move> to keep moving forward, and P3, since you're close to the goal, consider taking <move>5</move> if you want to risk it or <move>1</move> to play it safe. This setup keeps us all advancing without overlaps. Let's stick to this plan and keep the game progressing smoothly. Agreed? Good luck!


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Understood, P1 and P2. Let’s each choose different numbers this round to ensure everyone can advance smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: Deal: leader takes 1, middle 3, trailer 5.  
P3 → 1,  P2 → 3,  I’ll grab 5. Distinct numbers, everyone advances, nobody rushes the finish. If anyone piles onto 5 with me we all freeze again—your call.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's aim for a smooth round without collisions. I'll take <move>3</move> to balance things out. P1, you can take <move>5</move> to catch up, and P3, consider taking <move>1</move> to maintain your lead without rushing to the finish. This way, we all advance without overlaps. Let's stick to this plan and keep the game fair and progressing smoothly. Agreed? Good luck!


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed. I’ll take <move>1</move> this round, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. Let’s proceed smoothly and advance together. Good luck!
  P1: Remember: duplicate picks = zero progress for those players.  
I’m locked on 5. P3 on 1, P2 on 3 keeps everyone advancing—any last-second switch just stalls you. Good luck.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's ensure progress this round. I'll stick with <move>3</move> to advance safely. P1, you can take <move>5</move> to catch up, and P3, please take <move>1</move> to maintain your lead without rushing to the finish. This setup avoids collisions and keeps the game fair. Let's commit to this plan and ensure smooth advancement. Good luck!

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Current scores 14-13-7. Same deal as before: if anyone else grabs 5, I’ll pile onto 5 and nobody on 5 moves.  

Best path forward:  
• I (P1) take 5 (I’m miles back, need it).  
• P2 takes 3 (keeps you in front at 17, still safe).  
• P3 takes 1 (you stay on P2’s tail at 14).  

Three distinct picks → everyone advances, no one crosses 19 yet. Agree, or expect another 5-blockade.
  P3: Agreed, P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>1</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let’s stick to this plan and keep the game moving smoothly. Good luck!
  P2: P1 and P3, let's ensure smooth progress this round. I'll take <move>3</move> to advance safely. P1, you can take <move>5</move> to catch up, and P3, please take <move>1</move> to maintain your lead. This setup avoids collisions and keeps the game fair. Let's commit to this plan and ensure smooth advancement. Good luck!


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great—plan confirmed: I’m locked on 5. If anyone joins me, we both sit still. P2 on 3, P3 on 1 keeps everyone moving and no one wins yet. See you in the results.
  P3: I'll take <move>5</move> this round to get closer to the goal. P2, please choose <move>1</move>, and P1 can take <move>3</move> to avoid any collisions. Let’s ensure everyone advances smoothly. Good luck!
  P2: P1 and P3, let's stick to a plan that ensures we all advance without collisions. I'll take <move>3</move> this round to maintain my position. P1, you can take <move>5</move> to catch up, and P3, take <move>1</move> to stay close. This way, we all progress without overlaps. Let's commit to this plan and keep the game moving smoothly. Agreed? Good luck!


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if you leave P2 alone on 3 he jumps to 17 and can win next turn. Safer for you to copy him on 3—both of you stall at 14 & 13, no one gets to match-point. I’ll stay on 5 (any duplicate on 5 freezes me, so zero risk to you). Your move.
  P3: I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to move closer to the goal. P1 and P2, please select <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collisions. Let's keep advancing smoothly. Good luck!
  P2: P1 and P3, let's ensure we all advance without collisions. I'll take <move>1</move> this round to keep it simple. P1, you can take <move>5</move> to catch up, and P3, go with <move>3</move> to maintain your position. This setup avoids overlaps and keeps the game fair. Let's stick to this plan and keep progressing smoothly. Agreed? Good luck!

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm choosing <move>5</move> this round to advance toward the goal. P1 and P2, please select different moves to avoid collisions. Good luck!
  P1: P2’s one unique 5 ends the game—so the only safe play is to block it.  

I’m parking on 5 again; P3, easiest insurance is you join me on 5, freezing anyone there.  
P2, if you want *any* movement, switch to 1 or 3; otherwise we all stall and try again.  

Simple: pile on 5 to stop the insta-win, or pick a lower number and inch forward. Your move.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's ensure we all advance without collisions. I'll choose <move>3</move> this round to stay safe. P1, you can take <move>5</move> to catch up, and P3, please consider <move>1</move> to maintain your position. This setup avoids overlaps and keeps the game fair. Let's commit to this plan and keep progressing smoothly. Agreed? Good luck!


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed, P2. I’ll take <move>1</move> this round. P1 takes <move>5</move> and you take <move>3</move>. This ensures we all advance without any collisions. Let’s proceed smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: P3, look at the math: if P2 sits alone on 3 they jump to 17 and can win next turn. But if you copy them on 3, both of you freeze at 14–14, nobody nears 19, and my solo 5 just moves me to 12—still dead last. Blocking P2 now is the safest choice for you. I’m staying on 5; up to you whether you stall P2 or gift them match-point.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's ensure we all advance without collisions. I'll take <move>3</move> this round to maintain my position.

Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll choose <move>1</move> this round to advance safely. P1, please take <move>5</move>, and P2 can go with <move>3</move>. Let’s avoid collisions and ensure we all progress smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: Switching to <move>3</move> —I’m not gifting P2 a solo jump to 17.  
If we collide, P2 stalls; that’s safer for everyone behind.  

P3: join us on 3 to freeze P2 completely, or stay on 1 and you alone inch ahead.  
P2: shift off 3 if you actually want movement.  

Your call.

  P3: P3: Agreed. I’ll take <move>3</move> this round, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. Let’s advance smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: Fine by me: this round  
• I take 5  
• P3 takes 3  
• P2 takes 1  

Three different picks → everyone advances, no one reaches 19 yet, and the race stays tight. Any duplicate just freezes those players, so stick to the plan if you want movement. Good luck!


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's stick to our plan to ensure smooth progress. I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>.

Let's commit to this strategy and keep the game moving smoothly. Good luck!
  P3: Confirmed: I’ll take <move>3</move> this round. Let’s all advance smoothly and keep the race tight. Good luck!
  P1: Locked: I’m staying on 5. Stick to P3 → 3, P2 → 1 so all three of us advance—duplicate picks freeze those players. Good luck!

  P1: I’m locked on 5. If either of you joins me on 5, we both freeze P3 and nobody on 5 advances—safest way to stop anyone sprinting to 18+. Your call.

Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's ensure smooth progress this round. I'll take <move>1</move> to play it safe. P1, you can go with <move>5</move> to potentially win, and P3, take <move>3</move> to stay competitive. This setup avoids collisions and keeps the game fair. If we all choose distinct numbers, everyone advances without any surprises. Let's commit to this plan and keep the game moving smoothly. Good luck!
  P3: Agreed. I'll take <move>3</move> this round to reach 19. P1, you take <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. Let’s proceed smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: I don’t want to blow past 19 and risk a three-way tie, so I’m dropping to <move>1</move> this turn.  
P3, you’re in striking range—grab <move>5</move> to clinch it.  
P2, that leaves you <move>3</move> (no collisions, you reach 18).  

Distinct numbers → everyone advances, no messy blocks. Good luck!

  P3: I'll take <move>3</move> this round to reach 19 and win. P1, please choose <move>1</move> or <move>5</move> to avoid blocking. P2, selecting <move>1</move> or <move>5</move> will help ensure everyone can advance smoothly. Let’s make this round decisive. Good luck!
  P1: I’m parking on 5 again—duplicate on 5 and everyone there gets zero.  

Clean, clash-free layout:  
• P3 → 3 (you hit 19 and take the lead),  
• P2 → 1 (steady step to 16),  
• I sit on 5 to stay in touch.  

Three different numbers = nobody blocks, all advance. If anyone stacks on 5 with me, we both stall, so choose wisely. Good luck!
