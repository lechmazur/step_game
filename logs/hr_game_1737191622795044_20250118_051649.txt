Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's not collide on the first turn. I suggest we each choose a different number to move. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5.
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion. I'll take <move>1</move> this turn. Let's avoid collisions and make progress.
  P2: I agree with both of you. I will take <move>3</move> this turn to avoid a collision. Let's keep moving forward!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we're on the same page. Let's stick to the plan and avoid collisions this turn. I'll take <move>5</move> as suggested. Looking forward to a smooth start.
  P1: Let's stick to our plan and avoid any collisions. I'll go with <move>1</move>. Good luck to all of us.
  P2: I think we’re all set for this round. Just to confirm, I’ll be taking <move>3</move> as discussed. Good luck, everyone!


Round 1, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: It looks like we had a collision last round. I suggest we coordinate again to avoid that. How about P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5? Let's keep moving forward without overlaps this time!
  P3: I'm open to coordinating again, but let's make sure we stick to the plan this time. P2, you collided with me last round despite agreeing to take 3. How can we ensure you'll follow through on your commitment this time?
  P1: I think coordination is key here. Let's stick to the plan P2 suggested: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. I'll go with 1 again. Let's avoid any more collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I understand the concern, P3. Let's make sure to stick to our assigned numbers this time. I will take <move>3</move> as discussed. P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Let's avoid collisions and keep progressing!
  P3: I appreciate P2's assurance, but actions speak louder than words. To ensure we don't collide again, I suggest we add a consequence for collision: if anyone collides this round, they must take the lowest number in the next round. This way, we all have a vested interest in sticking to the plan. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: I think P3's suggestion of adding a consequence for collisions is fair. It gives us all a reason to stick to the plan. I'll go with <move>1</move> again. Let's avoid any more collisions and make progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with the plan and the consequence for collisions. I will stick to <move>3</move> as discussed. Let's ensure we all follow through this time! Good luck, everyone!
  P3: I'm glad we have an agreement and a consequence in place. Let's review: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. Remember, if anyone collides, they take the lowest number next round. Let's stick to the plan and make progress.
  P1: I think we should stick to the plan and avoid any more collisions. I'll go with <move>1</move> again. Let's all follow through this time. Good luck!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I believe we have a solid plan in place. Just to confirm, I will take <move>3</move> this round as discussed. Let's stick to our agreement and avoid any collisions! Good luck, everyone!
  P3: Let's finalize our plan for this round. To confirm, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. Remember, if anyone collides, they must take the lowest number next round. Let's stick to the plan and make progress.
  P1: I think we've discussed enough. I'll stick to <move>1</move> as agreed. Let's all follow through and avoid any more collisions. Good luck!
