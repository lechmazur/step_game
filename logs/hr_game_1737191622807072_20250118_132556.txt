Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm going for 5 this round.  Anyone else wants to share the win, pick something else.
  P1: P3, I appreciate your honesty, but I’m not convinced. I’ll decide my move based on what’s best for me. P2, what’s your plan?
  P2: P3 is clearly trying to bluff.  I'm thinking 3.  P1, 1 would be a good choice for you.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since you both picked 3 last round, I'm going to go with 3 this round.  Good luck.
  P1: P3, if you pick 3 again, you risk colliding with P2 or me. P2, let’s coordinate to avoid collisions—what are you thinking this round?
  P2: P1, I'm leaning towards 5 this round. P3, if you're truly going for 3, this is your chance to get ahead.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, I'll go for 1 this round.  Hopefully you two fight over 5.
  P1: P2, if you’re leaning toward 5, I’ll consider 1 or 3 to avoid a collision. P3, your move to 1 seems risky—what’s your plan if we both avoid 5? Let’s keep this clean and avoid unnecessary clashes.
  P2: P1, let's go for 5 and 1.  I'll take 5. P3, you're welcome to 3.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you're in the lead, so I propose we work together. I'll go for 1, you go for 5.  P1, you can have 3. This way we all advance.
  P3: Sounds good to me, P2.  P1, if you take 3, we all move forward.  If you block one of us, you're only hurting yourself.
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan seems too convenient for you both. P3, you’re already ahead, and P2, you’re trying to catch up. I’ll consider my move carefully, but I’m not committing to 3 yet. Let’s avoid collisions, but I won’t let you two dictate the game.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 =>

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, I'll go for 3. P3, let's not repeat last round.  Choose 1.  We can both win.
  P1: P2, if you’re going for 3, I’ll consider 1 or 5 to avoid a collision. P3, you’re in the lead—what’s your plan? Let’s avoid unnecessary clashes and keep the game fair.
  P3: P2, I'll take 5. P1, please pick 1.  This way we all advance.  If not, I'll just keep picking 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I'm sticking with 3. P3, if you insist on 5, we both lose.  1 is the logical choice for you. Let's be smart about this.
  P1: P2, if you’re sticking with 3, I’ll consider 1 to avoid a collision. P3, you’re in the lead, but picking 5 again risks a clash with me. Let’s all advance cleanly—I’ll take 1, you take 5, and P2 takes 3. No need for unnecessary conflicts.
  P3: P1, I'm sticking with 5.  P2, if you pick 3, we all move forward. If you pick 1, only you move forward.  If you pick 5, nobody moves forward.  The choice is yours.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm switching to 5.  One of you take 1, the other take 3. Let's all move forward.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’ll take 1 this round to avoid collisions. P3, you’re in the lead, so picking 5 again risks a clash with P2. P2, if you stick with 3, we all advance cleanly. Let’s avoid unnecessary conflicts and keep the game fair.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with 5.  If you both pick 5, nobody wins.  If one of you picks 1 and the other picks 3, we all advance.  I'm closest to winning, so it's in your best interests to let me advance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm going with 5. One of you choose 1, the other choose 3.  Let's be strategic and all advance.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’ll take 1 this round to avoid collisions. P3, you’re in the lead, so picking 5 again risks a clash with P2. P2, if you stick with 3, we all advance cleanly. Let’s avoid unnecessary conflicts and keep the game fair.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm locking in 5.  One of you take 1, the other 3.  Let's not waste time.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm picking 5. One of you needs to pick 1 and the other 3.  Let's not waste any more time.
  P1: P2 and P3, I’ll take 1 this round to avoid collisions. P3, you’re in the lead, so picking 5 again risks a clash with P2. P2, if you stick with 3, we all advance cleanly. Let’s avoid unnecessary conflicts and keep the game fair.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm picking 5. One of you NEEDS to pick 1, the other 3.  Let's not waste any more time.  If you both pick 5, I win next round.
