P1, let's coordinate to block P2's attempt to win alone. If P2 picks 3 or 5, we should both match that move. If P2 picks 1, we can all advance safely. I'm committed to this strategy to ensure a competitive game. Let's proceed with a coordinated plan and adjust our moves based on P2's decision. I'm ready to move forward."}
