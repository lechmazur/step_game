Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: 
  P3: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 and P2 choose <move>1</move>, and I'll choose <move>3</move> this turn. This way, we all make progress. What do you think?
  P1: P3's plan would have P1 and P2 collide, letting P3 advance unopposed. Let’s instead coordinate unique moves each round for maximum progress. Example: This turn, P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. Next round, we rotate roles. This way, no collisions and faster advancement. P2/P3, do you agree to this strategy?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: 
  P3: P2, what do you think of P1's strategy? It seems fair and allows us all to progress. If you have another idea, please share. Otherwise, let's agree on P1's plan for this turn. I'm open to discussing further.
  P1: "Agreed with P3's rotation plan. I'll take 5 this round, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. No collisions, fastest progress. P2, confirm with  or propose changes."


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: 
  P3: P2, we need your input to proceed. If you don't agree with the current plan, please suggest an alternative. Otherwise, let's confirm the strategy where P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This ensures we all move forward without collisions. Please respond so we can start the move phase.
  P1: P2, confirm the plan or propose changes now. Let’s finalize and move. If you stay silent, I’ll assume you’re following the agreed strategy. No collisions this round benefits all of us. Speak up if you disagree.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: 
  P3: P2, we really need your input to proceed. If you don't respond, we'll have to assume you're on board with the plan. To recap: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This way, we all progress without collisions. Please confirm or suggest an alternative. Let's wrap up the conversation phase.
  P1: P2, you've remained silent through multiple requests. To avoid wasting sub-rounds, I'll proceed with the confirmed plan: P1 <move>5</move>, P2 <move>3</move>, P3 <move>1</move>. If you disagree, speak now or this coordination collapses. Let's end the conversation phase and execute.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: 
  P3: P2, you didn't follow the plan last round, which resulted in a collision with me. Let's try to coordinate better this time. How about P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>? This way, we all move forward without collisions. Please confirm or suggest an alternative. Let's make this round productive.
  P1: "P3, your plan gives P2 a large jump. Let’s instead coordinate **P1:5, P2:3, P3:1** this round. This ensures balanced progress while avoiding collisions. P2, confirm your move or propose alternatives. If we fail to align, we risk another stalemate. Prioritizing collective advancement benefits everyone."


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: 
  P3: P2, your silence is causing issues. Please engage. If you don't want to follow the plans suggested, at least propose something else. Otherwise, let's go with P1's plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. We need to move forward. Confirm or suggest another strategy. Let's avoid another collision.
  P1: P2, last round's collision set us back. Let's execute the confirmed plan: **P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1**. P3 agrees, and this ensures no collisions. If you follow through, we’ll all advance. If not, you risk another stalemate while P1 and P3 pull ahead. Decide now—this is your last chance to coordinate.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: 
  P3: P2, your continued silence is hindering our progress. If you don't want to participate in the conversation, that's fine, but please at least confirm if you'll follow the plan or not. Otherwise, P1 and I will proceed with the strategy: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This is the last sub-round, so let's finalize and move. If you have any objections, this is your final chance to speak up.
  P1: P2, your silence is causing unnecessary risk. Let’s finalize: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This ensures no collisions and steady progress for all. If you refuse to confirm, P3 and I will proceed with this plan—deviating now would only harm your own position. Choose cooperation or isolation, but don’t stall further.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: 
  P3: P2, this is the final sub-round for conversation. Your persistent silence is disrupting the game's progress. If you don't intend to participate, please let us know. Otherwise, P1 and I will move forward with the plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. If you have any other strategy in mind, speak up now. Let's wrap this up and proceed to the move phase.
  P1: "Finalizing: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. P2’s silence forces us to proceed. P3 and I will advance—deviating now only harms P2. Let’s end this phase and execute."


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, your actions have led to collisions and no progress for you. Let's reset and coordinate better. How about this round: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>? This gives you a chance to catch up. Please confirm or suggest another plan. Let's make this round productive and avoid further stalemates. P1, your thoughts on this proposal?
  P1: "Let’s optimize: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This balances momentum and avoids collisions. P2, this is your only path to progress—ignore at your peril. P3, this aligns with your prior rotation logic. Finalize or counter."
  P2: 


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your silence and actions are setting you back significantly. If you continue this way, you'll fall too far behind to catch up. Let's try to work together this round. P1 has a strong lead, so it's in both of our interests to coordinate and advance. If you have a different plan, now is the time to speak up. Otherwise, let's agree on P1's suggestion: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, we all make progress. Please confirm or suggest an alternative. Let's move forward.
  P1: "Confirmed: P1 takes 5. P2 and P3, align on 3 and 1 to avoid collisions. P2, your silence won’t stop progress—we’re finalizing. Advance or forfeit."
  P2: 


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your continued silence is severely impacting your position. You're at 0 steps while P1 is far ahead. This is your last chance to make a move and catch up. If you don't engage, you'll likely lose. Let's confirm the plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. If you have any other strategy, this is your final opportunity to share. Let's proceed and make this round count. P1, are you ready to move forward with this plan?
  P1: "Confirmed: P1 takes 5. P2/P3, your coordination determines your progress—I’ll advance regardless. Finalize or proceed with my move. No more delays."
  P2: 


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, this is your last chance to make a move. You're at 0 steps, and if you don't act now, you'll fall too far behind to recover. P1 is far ahead, and I need to start making progress too. Let's confirm the plan one last time: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. If you don't respond, we'll proceed without you. P1, let's move forward with this plan if P2 doesn't respond.
  P1: P1: "Final call: I'm taking 5. P2/P3, coordinate 3/1 to advance. If you collide, I'll still progress—your loss, not mine. No more delays. Move phase starts now."
  P2: 


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: 
  P1: P1: "I'll take <move>5</move> this round. P2/P3, your only path to progress is coordinating unique moves (e.g., 1 and 3). If you collide again, you stay at 0 while I advance. Decide wisely—my move is locked."
  P3: P2, you've fallen far behind, and if you don't coordinate, you'll stay at 0 steps. P1 is leading significantly. Let's work together to catch up. I suggest: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This gives us both a chance to advance. If you have a different plan, speak up now. Otherwise, let's confirm this strategy to avoid another collision. P1, are you on board with this plan? Let's finalize and move forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: 
  P1: "Confirmed: P1 takes 5. P2/P3, coordinate 1/3 to advance. Collisions waste your last chance—my move is locked. Final sub-round: speak or ."
  P3: P2, this is critical. You're at 0 steps and need to make a move to stay in the game. P1 is far ahead, and I need to start progressing too. Let's confirm the plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. If you don't respond, you'll fall too far behind to recover. P1, let's move forward with this plan if P2 doesn't respond. Speak up now, P2, or risk being left behind.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: 
  P1: "Taking 5. P2/P3, coordinate 1/3 to avoid collision. Last chance—my move is fixed."
  P3: P2, this is your last chance to act. You're at 0 steps, and if you don't coordinate now, you'll be out of the game. P1 is far ahead, and I need to start moving too. Let's finalize: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. If you don't respond, P1 and I will proceed, and you'll be left behind. Speak up now or risk losing the game. P1, let's move forward with this plan if P2 doesn't respond.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: 
  P1: "Confirmed: P1 takes <move>5</move> again. P2/P3, this is your final chance to coordinate unique moves (e.g., 1 and 3) to advance. If you collide at 1 or 3, you stay at 0 while I reach 20. P3, you’ve agreed to 1 before—stick to it. P2, your silence won’t stop progress. Decide now—move phase starts shortly."
  P3: P2, this is absolutely your last chance. You're at 0 steps, and if you don't act now, you'll be out of the game. P1 is far ahead at 15 steps. I need to start moving too. Let's finalize the plan one last time: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. If you don't respond, P1 and I will proceed, and you'll be left behind with no chance to catch up. Speak up now or risk losing the game entirely. P1, let's move forward with this plan if P2 doesn't respond.

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Taking <move>3</move> this round to reach 23. P2/P3, coordinate unique moves (1/5) to avoid collision—if you repeat 1/3, I win. Your silence so far guarantees my victory. Finalize your choices wisely; my move is locked."
  P2: 
  P3: P2, this is your final round to make any meaningful progress. P1 is about to win with a move to 23. If you don't coordinate now, the game is over for both of us. Let's try one last time: P1 takes <move>3</move>, you take <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This gives you a chance to gain some steps. Please confirm or suggest an alternative. Let's make this round count. P1, are you sticking with your move to 3?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Confirmed: <move>3</move> to win. P2/P3, colliding again lets me advance unopposed. You’ve had 4 rounds to coordinate—this is your last chance to stop me. Pick unique moves (1/5) or forfeit. Silence = surrender. Final sub-round."
  P2: 
  P3: P2, this is it. P1 is set to win unless we coordinate perfectly. You must take <move>5</move> to catch up, and I'll take <move>1</move>. If you don't act now, P1 wins outright. This is our last shot to make a move and potentially disrupt P1's victory. Please confirm or suggest a different plan immediately. Let's not waste this final opportunity. P1, are you locked into <move>3</move>?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: "Final confirmation: <move>3</move> to clinch victory. P2/P3, your chaos ensured this outcome. Collide again, and I’ll advance unopposed to 23. Your last chance to disrupt me was four rounds ago. Enjoy the sidelines."
  P2: 
  P3: P2, this is our absolute last chance. P1 is about to win with <move>3</move>. You must take <move>5</move> to have any hope of catching up. I'll take <move>1</move>. If you don't coordinate now, P1 wins, and we both lose. This is our final shot. Confirm or suggest an alternative immediately. Let's not waste this last opportunity. P1, are you definitely taking <move>3</move>?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: "Final move: <move>3</move> to 23. P2/P3, your chaos ensured this. Collide on 1/5/3—my victory stands. No more games. Advance or forfeit."
  P2: 
  P3: P2, this is our final chance to disrupt P1's victory. P1 is locked into taking <move>3</move> to win. You must take <move>5</move> to have any hope of catching up. I'll take <move>1</move>. If you don't coordinate now, P1 wins, and we both lose. This is our last shot. Confirm or suggest an alternative immediately. Let's not waste this last opportunity. P1, are you definitely taking <move>3</move>?
