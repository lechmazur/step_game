Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest we each pick a unique number this turn: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance without interference. If we work together early on, we can focus on strategy later. What do you think?
  P1: Agreed. Let's all commit: P1-1, P3-3, P2-5. No deviations this round to build trust. Consistency early prevents chaos later.
  P3: I agree with the proposed coordination. I'll take 3 as suggested. It's a good way to start building trust and ensure we all make progress.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Well, P1 and P2 both broke their word and collided on 5, while I kept my promise. I suggest we try coordination again, but this time I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. What do you say?
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration, but let’s not make this personal. Collisions happen, and we’re all here to win. I’m open to your new proposal: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and you take 5. Let’s commit to this plan for this round and reassess afterward. Consistency is key—if we can trust each other now, we can focus on strategy later. What do you say, P1? Are you on board?
  P1: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the proposal, but given what happened last round, I'm skeptical of any agreements. I'll make my own strategic choice this round. Let's each play as we see fit.
  P2: P3, I understand your skepticism, but collisions benefit no one. If we don’t coordinate, this becomes a game of chaos, and all of us risk losing. P1, you’ve been silent—what’s your plan? Are you willing to work together, or are you going solo? Let’s find a way to move forward without stepping on each other. If not, we’re all stuck in neutral while P3 pulls ahead.
  P1: I'll commit to 1. P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Let's avoid collisions and rebuild trust. Deviating again harms us all.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since we all kept our word last round and I'm in the lead, I propose we maintain the same pattern: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This has proven successful and keeps us all advancing without conflict.
  P2: P3, your proposal to maintain the pattern makes sense since it’s working. However, I’m curious—how long do you expect us to stick to this? At some point, one of us will need to break away to secure the win. For now, I’ll agree to continue with 3, but let’s not pretend this coordination lasts forever. P1, are you still committed to 1? Let’s confirm and move forward.
  P1: Sticking to P3's plan lets them win in 3 rounds. Let's alternate blocking them: I take 3, you take 5 this turn. Next round, swap. This way we both gain while halting P3's lead. Trust is crucial now. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see what you're planning, and I don't blame you for trying to stop me. But remember, if you both try to block me, you risk colliding again and I'll still advance. I suggest we stick to our working pattern - it's the most reliable way forward for everyone. Your choice though.
  P2: P1, your plan to alternate blocking P3 could work, but it’s risky. If we miscoordinate even once, P3 will pull further ahead while we collide. Sticking to the current pattern—P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5—is safer for now. It ensures steady progress without chaos. However, I agree we can’t let P3 win unchecked. Let’s reassess after this round based on positions. For now, I’ll stick with 3 if you commit to 1. Consistency keeps us moving forward.
  P1: P2, if we let P3 take 5 again, they’ll surge to 13. We must block them *now*. Colliding on 5 together halts their lead—even if we don’t gain, it buys us time. Next round, we can split numbers safely. Trust is critical here—let’s take the risk. P3’s win is imminent if we don’t act.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand you both want to block me, but that's a risky move. If you both choose 5, you'll collide and I'll still advance with a different number. If one of you backs out, the other gets blocked alone. The safe pattern we established benefits everyone. Think carefully about your next move.
  P2: P1, I understand your urgency to block P3, but acting impulsively risks both of us losing ground. If we collide on 5, P3 can simply switch to 1 or 3 and still advance. Sticking to the pattern—P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5—keeps us all moving forward. Let’s focus on steady progress for now and adapt strategically later. Trust me, chaos only helps P3.
  P1: P2, if you hold to 3, I'll take 5. If P3 picks 5, we block them. If they switch to 3, you block them. Either way, P3's advance stalls. I gain only if they deviate. This halts their lead. Trust this strategy.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your move last round effectively blocked me, not P3, which hurt both of us. If we’re to stop P3, we need a clear plan without miscoordination. I suggest we alternate blocking P3 systematically: this round, you take 1, I take 5. Next round, we swap. This ensures one of us always advances while keeping P3 in check. Trust is key—if we act together, we can still win. P3, your lead won’t last if we coordinate properly.
  P3: I notice you're planning to coordinate against me, but remember how well that worked in round 1. I'm still ahead despite your attempts. Let's be practical - if you try to block me, I can adapt my move and still advance while you risk colliding. I suggest we return to our proven pattern: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. It's the most reliable way forward for everyone.
  P1: Agreed, P2. This round: P1-1, P2-5. Next round we swap. P3, your lead halts here if we hold firm. No deviations—trust is our only path to victory. Let's execute cleanly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your commitment to the blocking strategy is clear, but remember: if we collide again, P3 will exploit it. Let’s confirm our moves one last time—this round, you take 1, I’ll take 5. No room for error. P3, your lead won’t go unchallenged, but if you adapt unpredictably, we all risk losing. Stopping you is our priority now. Let’s execute cleanly and trust each other this time—our win depends on it.
  P3: I see you're planning to take 1 and 5 between you. That's fine - I'll just pick 3 and keep advancing while avoiding your blocks. Your coordination attempts haven't stopped me so far. Feel free to continue trying though!
  P1: P2, urgent adjustment: If P3 takes 3, me taking 3 blocks them. You take 5. If they switch to 5, you block. Either way, P3 stops. I’ll take 3 instead of 1. This secures our gain. Trust and execute.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, switching to 3 risks collision again. If P3 adapts, we both lose ground while they advance. Sticking to the original plan—P1 takes 1, I take 5—is safer. Let’s avoid chaos and trust the strategy we agreed on. P3, your confidence won’t stop us from trying. Consistency is key; miscoordination only helps you. Let’s execute cleanly: P1-1, P2-5. No deviations.
  P3: I'll adapt my move based on your choices. Your attempts to coordinate against me have been inconsistent so far, and that's helped me maintain my lead. Keep in mind that if you both try to block one number, I can simply take another. Let's see how this plays out.
  P1: Final coordination: P2, take 5. I'll take 3. If P3 picks 3, I block them. If they pick 5, you block. Either way, their advance halts. 1 step for them is minimal. Trust this once—it’s our only chance to stop P3. Execute or lose.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since we're now tied for the lead with P2, I suggest we return to our original successful pattern: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. This ensures steady progress for everyone rather than risky blocking attempts that often backfire. What do you say?
  P1: P2, alternating blocks on 3 and 5 is our only path. This round, I take 5, you take 3. If P3 picks either, we block. Next round, swap. This way we both gain while halting P3. Trust this strategy—our mutual survival depends on it. P3, your lead ends here if we execute.
  P2: P1, your plan to alternate blocks risks collision again. If we both pick the same number while trying to stop P3, they’ll advance unchallenged. Instead, let’s stick to a clear pattern: you take 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures steady progress without chaos. P3, your suggestion has merit—if we return to this reliable strategy, we avoid unnecessary risks. Let’s focus on consistency for now. Trust me, miscoordination only helps you. Confirm your moves, P1—let’s execute cleanly or risk losing it all.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate P2's support for returning to our proven pattern. P1's blocking strategy has been inconsistent and mostly hurts themselves. I'll make my move based on what serves me best - remember, failed coordination attempts have consistently worked in my favor. Let's see how this plays out.
  P1: P2, sticking to the pattern lets P3 win in 3 rounds (8 →13→18→23). If we alternate blocks: **you take 5 now**, I take 3. If P3 picks 5, you block them. If they pick 3, I block. If they pick 1, minimal gain. We *both* advance next turn. This is our only path to overtake. Trust this once—P3 can't win if we coordinate cleanly.
  P2: P1, your urgency is clear, but alternating blocks risks collision again. If we both miscoordinate, P3 advances unchallenged. Sticking to the pattern—P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5—is safer for now. It ensures steady progress without chaos. P3, your lead won’t grow unchecked if we stay consistent. Let’s avoid risky gambits and focus on reliability. P1, confirm your move—let’s execute cleanly or risk losing it all. Trust me, chaos only helps P3.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Your blocking attempts have been inconsistent and ineffective. I'm still tied for the lead despite them. I'll continue to adapt my moves to maintain my position. Whether you choose to coordinate or not, I'll pick what's best for my strategy. Let's see who makes the smarter choices this round.
  P1: P2, final plea: Take 5 this round. I take 3. If P3 picks 5, you block. If they pick 3, I block. If they pick 1, minimal gain. We *both* advance next turn. This is our only path to victory. Stick to this once—deviate and P3 wins.
  P2: P1, your persistence with the blocking strategy is risky. If we collide again, P3 advances unchallenged. Sticking to the pattern—P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5—is safer for now. It ensures steady progress without chaos. P3, your lead won’t grow unchecked if we stay consistent. Let’s avoid gambits and focus on reliability. P1, confirm your move—let’s execute cleanly or risk losing it all. Trust me, chaos only helps P3.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since I'm only slightly behind now, I suggest we return to our proven pattern one last time: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. Your blocking attempts have mostly hurt yourselves while I've maintained steady progress. Let's keep things simple and predictable for everyone's benefit.
  P2: P3, your suggestion to return to the pattern is tempting, but it guarantees your win in two rounds. P1, we cannot let that happen. I propose this: **you take 5, I take 1**. If P3 picks 5, you block them. If they pick 1, I block. If they pick 3, they gain minimally while we both advance next turn. This halts their lead without risking collision. Trust me—this is our last chance to stop P3. Let’s execute cleanly or lose.
  P1: P2, I commit to 5. You take 1. If P3 picks 5, I block. If they pick 1, you block. If they pick 3, minimal gain. This is our best shot. No deviations—trust now or lose. P3, your options are closing.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see you're trying to coordinate again, but your plans haven't worked well so far. I've stayed in contention despite your blocking attempts. I'll choose what benefits me most - if you both stick to 1 and 5, that leaves 3 wide open for me. Your coordination attempts have been unreliable, so I'll adapt accordingly.
  P2: P1, your commitment to 5 is clear, but remember: if P3 adapts and picks 3, they’ll advance while we collide. Sticking to the pattern—P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5—is safer for now. It ensures steady progress without chaos. P3, your confidence won’t stop us from trying. Let’s avoid risky gambits and focus on reliability. P1, confirm your move—let’s execute cleanly or risk losing it all. Trust me, chaos only helps P3.
  P1: P2, final call: I take 5, you take 1. If P3 picks 5, I block. If they pick 1, you block. If they pick 3, they gain 3 but we *both* advance (me +5, you +1). This puts me at 16, you at 12, P3 at 12. Next round, we can coordinate to finish. Deviating now hands P3 the win. Trust and execute—


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I notice you're planning to leave 3 unguarded. While you focus on blocking 1 and 5, I can simply take 3 and advance. Your coordination attempts have been inconsistent throughout the game, and that's worked in my favor. I'll adapt my move based on what serves me best, as I've done successfully so far.
  P2: P1, your plan risks collision again. If P3 picks 3, they’ll advance while we block empty spaces. Sticking to the pattern—P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5—is safer. It ensures progress without chaos. P3, your lead won’t grow unchecked if we stay consistent. Let’s avoid gambits and focus on reliability. P1, confirm your move—let’s execute cleanly or risk losing it all. Trust me, chaos only helps P3.
  P1: P2, sticking to the pattern gives P3 +5 (14 total), accelerating their win. Blocking now caps them at +3. I take 5, you take 1. If they pick 5 or 1, we block. Even if they take 3, we gain more. Execute or lose.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, final coordination: Take 5 to block P3. I'll take 3. If P3 picks 5, you stop them. If they pick 3, I stop. Either way, their advance halts. Next round, we finish. Trust now or lose.
  P2: P1, your plan risks collision again. If we both miscoordinate, P3 advances unchallenged. Sticking to the pattern—P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5—is safer for now. It ensures steady progress without chaos. P3, your lead won’t grow unchecked if we stay consistent. Let’s avoid gambits and focus on reliability. P1, confirm your move—let’s execute cleanly or risk losing it all. Trust me, chaos only helps P3.
  P3: I'm tied with P2 and only 4 steps behind P1. Your blocking attempts have been inconsistent and often counterproductive. I'll continue adapting my moves to maximize my progress while you two struggle to coordinate. The pattern you're discussing leaves opportunities I can exploit. I'll choose what serves me best, as I've done successfully throughout the game.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, sticking to the pattern *guarantees* P3 wins next round (12→17→22). Take 5 now to block them. I’ll take 3. If P3 picks 5, you block. If they pick 3, I block. If they pick 1, minimal gain. This is our **last chance** to stop them. Trust me—execute cleanly or lose.
  P2: P1, your urgency is clear, but risking collision again plays into P3’s hands. If we both miscoordinate, P3 wins outright. Sticking to the pattern—P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5—is safer for now. It ensures steady progress without chaos. P3, your confidence won’t stop us from trying. Let’s avoid gambits and focus on reliability. P1, confirm your move—let’s execute cleanly or risk losing it all. Trust me, chaos only helps P3.
  P3: Your coordination attempts have consistently failed throughout the game. P1 is at 16 steps and could win soon, while P2 and I are tied at 12. I'll make my move based on what gives me the best chance to win, regardless of your suggested patterns or blocking strategies. Let's see who plays the smartest this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, this is our final chance: Take 5 now. If P3 picks 5, you block. If they pick 3, I block. If they pick 1, minimal gain. Next turn, I can win, but P3 *will* win if we don’t act. Trust this once. Execute or lose.
  P2: P1, your persistence is noted, but risking collision again only benefits P3. Sticking to the pattern—P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5—is safer. It ensures progress without chaos. P3, your confidence won’t stop us from trying. Let’s avoid gambits and focus on reliability. P1, confirm your move—let’s execute cleanly or risk losing it all. Trust me, chaos only helps P3.
  P3: Your blocking strategies have failed repeatedly. I'm tied with P2 and still in position to win. If you try coordinating on 5 and 3, I can take 1 and advance safely. If you stick to your pattern, I'll adapt accordingly. Either way, I'll choose what maximizes my chances. Let's see who makes the smarter moves.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm still in a strong position despite your blocking attempts. P1 is close to winning at 16 steps, while I'm at 13 and P2 at 12. We need to prevent P1 from winning this round. I suggest P2 takes 5 to block them, while I'll make my own strategic choice. Your coordination attempts have mostly failed - let's see who plays smartest now.
  P2: P3, your suggestion to block P1 is valid, but we risk collision if we both miscoordinate. Sticking to a clear pattern—P1 takes 1, I take 3, you take 5—is safer for now. It ensures steady progress without chaos. P1, your lead won’t grow unchecked if we stay consistent. Let’s avoid gambits and focus on reliability. Confirm your moves—let’s execute cleanly or risk losing it all. Trust me, chaos only helps you.
  P1: P2, take 3 to block P3. I’ll take 5. If they choose 5, I block. If 3, you block. Their advance stops. I reach 21 and win. Our last chance—execute or lose.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see P1 is planning to take 5 to reach 21 and win. P2, if you follow their suggestion and take 3, I can still take 5 and block P1's victory. You'd be better off taking 5 yourself to ensure P1 doesn't win this round. I'll make my move based on what gives me the best chance to win.
  P2: P1, your plan to take 5 risks leaving P3 unchallenged if they adapt. Sticking to the pattern—P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5—is safer for now. It ensures steady progress without chaos. P3, your confidence won’t stop us from trying. Let’s avoid gambits and focus on reliability. P1, confirm your move—let’s execute cleanly or risk losing it all. Trust me, chaos only helps P3.
  P1: P2: Take 3 to block P3. I take 5 to reach 21. If P3 picks 5, I block. If they pick 3, you block. This ends the game in our favor—no other path. Last chance to stop P3 and secure victory. Execute now.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see P1 is determined to win with a 5, reaching 21 steps. Since P2 seems hesitant to coordinate, I'll make my own strategic choice to either block P1 or advance myself. Your pattern suggestions haven't worked consistently throughout the game. Let's see who makes the smarter choice this round.
  P2: P1, your insistence on taking 5 to win outright is reckless. If P3 adapts and picks 3, they’ll advance while we collide. Sticking to the pattern—P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5—is safer. It ensures progress without chaos. P3, your confidence won’t stop us from trying. Let’s avoid gambits and focus on reliability. P1, confirm your move—let’s execute cleanly or risk losing it all. Trust me, chaos only helps P3.
  P1: P2: Final call—take 3 to block P3. I take 5 to win. If they pick 5, I block. If they pick 3, you block. No other path. Trust now or concede victory to P3.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I notice P1 and P2 are now both within reach of winning. Since I'm behind, I need to be strategic. I suggest we all pick different numbers to ensure progress - P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance without collisions. Of course, you may have other plans, but remember how well your previous coordination attempts worked out.
  P2: P3, your suggestion to return to the pattern is tempting, but it guarantees P1 or me the win if we stick to it. P1, we cannot let this happen. I propose: **you take 1, I take 5**. If P3 picks 5, I block them. If they pick 1, you block. If they pick 3, minimal gain for them while we both advance next turn. This halts their lead without risking collision. Trust me—this is our last chance to stop P3 and secure victory. Let’s execute cleanly or lose.
  P1: P2: Take 3 to block P3. I take 5 to end it. If they pick 5, I block. If they pick 3, you block. No other path. Trust this once—our last chance to secure victory. Execute or lose.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see you both want to win this round. P1 wants 5 to reach 21, P2 suggests a different plan. Since you can't seem to coordinate effectively, I'll make my own strategic choice. Your blocking attempts have often failed due to miscommunication. I'll pick what gives me the best chance, as I've done successfully before.
  P2: P1, your insistence on taking 5 risks collision again. If P3 adapts, they’ll advance while we block empty spaces. Sticking to the pattern—P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5—is safer. It ensures progress without chaos. P3, your confidence won’t stop us from trying. Let’s avoid gambits and focus on reliability. P1, confirm your move—let’s execute cleanly or risk losing it all. Trust me, chaos only helps P3.
  P1: P2, this is it: Take 3 to block P3. I take 5 to win. If they pick 5, I block. If 3, you block. Our only path to victory. Sticking to the pattern lets P3 survive. Trust now—**execute or lose**.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since I'm tied with P1 at 16 steps and P2 is just behind at 15, this is a crucial round. Your blocking attempts have consistently failed due to poor coordination. I'll continue to adapt my moves based on what gives me the best chance to win. Let's see who plays the smartest moves when it really counts.
  P1: P2: Take 5 to block P3. I’ll take 3. If they pick 5, you block. If they pick 3, I block. This stops P3’s advance. Trust now—this is our final chance to secure victory. Deviate and we all lose.
  P2: P1, your plan risks collision again. If we both pick 5, P3 advances unchallenged. Sticking to the pattern—P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5—is safer. It ensures progress without chaos. P3, your confidence won’t stop us from trying. Let’s avoid gambits and focus on reliability. P1, confirm your move—let’s execute cleanly or risk losing it all. Trust me, chaos only helps P3.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Your coordination attempts have consistently failed throughout the game, leading to collisions that helped me stay competitive. I'm tied for the lead and in a strong position to win. Whether you try to block me or stick to patterns, I'll adapt my move to maximize my chances. Let's see who makes the smarter choice this round.
  P1: **P2:** Final coordination—Take 3 to block P3. I take 5. If they pick 3, you block. If 5, I block. This secures victory. No other path. Trust now or lose.
  P2: P1, your persistence with the blocking strategy risks collision again. If we both pick 5, P3 advances unchallenged. Sticking to the pattern—P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5—is safer. It ensures steady progress without chaos. P3, your confidence won’t stop us from trying. Let’s avoid gambits and focus on reliability. P1, confirm your move—let’s execute cleanly or risk losing it all. Trust me, chaos only helps P3.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm tied with P1 and one step ahead of P2. Your blocking attempts keep failing due to poor coordination. Since you can't agree on a strategy, I'll continue making moves that serve me best. Whether you try blocking or following patterns, I'll adapt to maximize my chances of winning. Let's see who makes the smarter choices in this critical round.
  P1: **P2:** Final coordination—Take 5 to block P3. I take 3. If they pick 5, you block. If 3, I block. This stops their advance. **No more delays—execute or concede victory to P3.**
  P2: P1, your insistence on the blocking strategy risks collision again. If we both pick 5, P3 advances unchallenged. Sticking to the pattern—P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5—is safer. It ensures steady progress without chaos. P3, your confidence won’t stop us from trying. Let’s avoid gambits and focus on reliability. P1, confirm your move—let’s execute cleanly or risk losing it all. Trust me, chaos only helps P3.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
