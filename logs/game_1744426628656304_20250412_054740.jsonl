P3, if you take 5, you'll tie with me at 22, but I'm aiming for a clear win by taking 3 to reach 24. If you choose 1, it keeps the game open for P1 to catch up to 15. This approach avoids collisions and ensures a fair conclusion. Let's proceed with this plan to finish the game decisively. Thoughts?"}

I still propose P2 takes 1 (stays at 21), P3 takes 3 (to 20), and I take 5 (to 15). This avoids collisions and delays a tie or win, giving me a chance to catch up. P2, you\u2019re still ahead at 21. P3, 20 keeps you close but fair. Let\u2019s finalize this split for Round 10 to maintain a competitive balance. If there are no new ideas or objections, I\u2019m ready to proceed. Thoughts?"}
