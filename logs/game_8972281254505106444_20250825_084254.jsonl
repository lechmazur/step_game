The key constraints and edge cases to consider are:\n- The amount to be changed is a positive integer.\n- The available coin denominations are positive integers.\n- The amount to be changed may be 0, in which case the answer should be 1 (there is exactly one way to make change for 0, which is to use no coins).\n- The amount to be changed may be negative, which is not a valid input (the answer should be 0).\n- There may be no coins available, in which case the answer should be 0 unless the amount to be changed is also 0.\n- The coin denominations are distinct, but this is not explicitly stated; however, it is implied that the coin denominations are distinct since they are given as a set.\n\nThe input consists of:\n- The amount to be changed (an integer)\n- The available coin denominations (a list of integers)\n\nThe output is the number of ways to make change for the given amount using the available coin denominations.\n\nSubtle requirements and implicit constraints mentioned in the trace include:\n- The need to handle cases where the amount to be changed is 0 or negative.\n- The need to handle cases where there are no coins available.\n\n# Key Insights\nThe crucial observations that lead to the solution are:\n- The problem can be broken down into smaller sub-problems by considering the number of ways to make change for smaller amounts using fewer coin denominations.\n- The number of ways to make change for a given amount using a set of coin denominations depends on the number of ways to make change for smaller amounts using subsets of the coin denominations.\n- The key insight is that the number of ways to make change for an amount using a set of coin denominations can be computed by considering whether to use a particular coin denomination or not.\n- If the coin denomination is greater than the amount to be changed, it cannot be used, so it is not considered.\n- The dynamic programming approach is suitable for this problem because it has overlapping sub-problems (computing the number of ways to make change for smaller amounts) and optimal sub-structure (the number of ways to make change for an amount can be computed from the number of ways to make change for smaller amounts).\n\nThe critical examples or test cases that led to insights are:\n- The case where the amount to be changed is 0.\n- The case where there are no coins available.\n- The case where the amount to be changed is negative (although this is not a valid input).\n\nThe key algorithmic insight is that the problem can be solved using dynamic programming, where the number of ways to make change for an amount is computed by considering the number of ways to make change for smaller amounts.\n\n# Solution Strategy\nThe steps to solve this problem are:\n1. Initialize a table to store the number of ways to make change for each amount from 0 to the given amount.\n2. Set the number of ways to make change for 0 to be 1.\n3. For each coin denomination, update the table by considering whether to use the coin denomination or not.\n4. For each amount from the value of the coin denomination to the given amount, update the number of ways to make change by adding the number of ways to make change for the amount minus the value of the coin denomination.\n5. The final answer is the number of ways to make change for the given amount.\n\nImportant optimizations or special cases to handle are:\n- Handling the case where the amount to be changed is 0.\n- Handling the case where there are no coins available.\n- Handling the case where the amount to be changed is negative (by returning 0 or handling it as an invalid input).\n\nHere's the python solution:\n```python\ndef count_ways(coins, total):\n    dp = [0] * (total + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    for coin in coins:\n        for i in range(coin, total + 1):\n            dp[i] += dp[i - coin]\n    return dp[total]\n\ndef main():\n    coins = [1, 2, 5]  # example coin denominations\n    total = 10\n    print(count_ways(coins, total))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"}

spectrometer. The ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ NMR chemical shifts were reported relative to tetramethylsilane (TMS).\n\n## 3. Results and discussion\n\n### 3.1. Synthesis and characterization\n\nThe synthetic routes to $\\mathbf{1}$ and $\\mathbf{2}$ are shown in Scheme 1. The complexes were prepared by the reaction of $\\mathrm{SmCl}_{3} \\cdot 6 \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ with $\\mathrm{NaL}^{1}$ or $\\mathrm{NaL}^{2}$ in a 1:3 molar ratio in THF. The reaction mixture was stirred for 24 h at room temperature. After the removal of the solvent, the residue was extracted with toluene. Complexes $\\mathbf{1}$ and $\\mathbf{2}$ were isolated as yellow crystals in $52 \\%$ and $45 \\%$ yields, respectively, after crystallization from a mixture of toluene and $n$-hexane at $-30^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.\n\nThe complexes were characterized by elemental analyses, IR and ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ NMR spectroscopy, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The results of elemental analyses of the two complexes are in good agreement with the theoretical values. In the IR spectra of $\\mathbf{1}$ and $\\mathbf{2}$, the characteristic $\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{N}$ stretching vibrations of the imino groups are observed at 1610 and $1614 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, respectively. The ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ NMR spectrum of $\\mathbf{1}$ in $\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{D}_{6}$ shows a singlet at 1.53 ppm for the methyl protons of the $\\mathrm{C}_{5} \\mathrm{Me}_{4}$ ring and a singlet at 8.40 ppm for the imino protons. The ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ NMR spectrum of $\\mathbf{2}$ in $\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{D}_{6}$ shows a singlet at 1.45 ppm for the methyl protons of the $\\mathrm{C}_{5} \\mathrm{Me}_{4}$ ring and a singlet at 8.36 ppm for the imino protons.\n\n### 3.2. Molecular structures\n\nThe molecular structures of $\\mathbf{1}$ and $\\mathbf{2}$ were determined by X-ray crystallography. The crystallographic data and refinement details are summarized in Table 1, and selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table 2. The ORTEP diagrams of $\\mathbf{1}$ and $\\mathbf{2}$ are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. Complex $\\mathbf{1}$ crystallizes in the triclinic space group $P \\overline{1}$ and $\\mathbf{2}$ crystallizes in the monoclinic space group $P 2_{1} / c$. In both complexes, the samarium atom is $\\eta^{5}$-coordinated by a $\\mathrm{C}_{5} \\mathrm{Me}_{4}$ ring and $\\sigma$-bonded to three imino $\\mathrm{N}$ atoms, giving a formal coordination number of eight. The average $\\mathrm{Sm}-\\mathrm{Cp}$ (ring centroid) distance is $2.432(4) \\AA$ for $\\mathbf{1}$ and $2.429(4) \\AA$ for $\\mathbf{2}$, and the average $\\mathrm{Sm}-\\mathrm{N}$ bond length is $2.468(4) \\AA$ for $\\mathbf{1}$ and $2.462(4) \\AA$ for $\\mathbf{2}$. The $\\mathrm{N}-\\mathrm{Sm}-\\mathrm{N}$ angles are in the range $86.4(2)-121.0(2)^{\\circ}$ for $\\mathbf{1}$ and $81.9(2)-$ $128.8(2)^{\\circ}$ for 2 . The $\\mathrm{Sm}-\\mathrm{N}$ bond lengths are comparable to those found in other samarium imino complexes [21-23]. The $\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{N}$ bond lengths are 1.282(7)-1.289(7) $\\AA$ for $\\mathbf{1}$ and $1.283(7)-1.286(7) \\AA$ for 2 , which are within the range of $\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{N}$ double bond lengths and are comparable to those found in other imino complexes [24-26].\n\n### 3.3. Catalytic activity\n\nThe catalytic activity of complexes $\\mathbf{1}$ and $\\mathbf{2}$ was tested in the polymerization of MMA. The results are summarized in Table 3. The polymerization results show that the two complexes are active for MMA polymerization, producing PMMA with high molecular weights and narrow molecular weight distributions. The activities of $\\mathbf{1}$ and $\\mathbf{2}$ are comparable, and the PMMA produced has similar $M_{\\mathrm{n}}$ and $M_{\\mathrm{w}} / M_{\\mathrm{n}}$ values. The catalytic activity of $\\mathbf{1}$ is slightly higher than that of $\\mathbf{2}$, and the $M_{\\mathrm{w}} / M_{\\mathrm{n}}$ value of PMMA produced by $\\mathbf{1}$ is slightly narrower than that produced by $\\mathbf{2}$. These results indicate that the steric effect of the $\\beta$-diketiminato ligand has a significant influence on the catalytic activity and stereoselectivity of the samarium complexes.\n\nTable 1\n\nCrystal data and structure refinement details for complexes $\\mathbf{1}$ and $\\mathbf{2}$.\n\n|  | 1 | 2 |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Empirical formula | $\\mathrm{C}_{34} \\mathrm{H}_{46} \\mathrm{~N}_{3} \\mathrm{Sm}$ | $\\mathrm{C}_{37} \\mathrm{H}_{52} \\mathrm{~N}_{3} \\mathrm{Sm}$ |\n| Formula weight | 632.09 | 698.16 |\n| Temperature $(\\mathrm{K})$ | $296(2)$ | $296(2)$ |\n| Wavelength $(\\AA)$ | 0.71073 | 0.71073 |\n| Crystal system | Triclinic | Monoclinic |\n| Space group | $P \\overline{1}$ | $P 2_{1} / c$ |\n| Unit cell dimensions |  |  |\n| $a(\\AA)$ | $11.304(2)$ | $11.449(2)$ |\n| $b(\\AA)$ | $12.478(3)$ | $21.801(4)$ |\n| $c(\\AA)$ | $12.811(3)$ | $16.229(3)$ |\n| $\\alpha\\left({ }^{\\circ}\\right)$ | $69.60(3)$ | 90 |\n| $\\beta\\left(^{\\circ}\\right)$ | $67.57(3)$ | $105.57(3)$ |\n| $\\gamma\\left({ }^{\\circ}\\right)$ | $67.52(3)$ | 90 |\n| Volume $\\left(\\AA^{3}\\right)$ | $1497.5(5)$ | $2436.4(8)$ |\n| $Z$ | 2 | 4 |\n| Density (calculated) $\\left(\\mathrm{g} \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\\right)$ | 1.402 | 1.268 |\n| Absorption coefficient $\\left(\\mathrm{mm}^{-1}\\right)$ | 2.073 | 1.592 |\n| $F(000)$ | 648 | 1024 |\n| Crystal size $(\\mathrm{mm})$ | $0.21 \\times 0.20 \\times 0.18$ | $0.22 \\times 0.21 \\times 0.20$ |\n| $\\theta$ range for data collection $\\left({ }^{\\circ}\\right)$ | $1.89-25.02$ | $1.86-25.02$ |\n| Index ranges | $-13 \\leq h \\leq 13$ | $-13 \\leq h \\leq 13$ |\n|  | $-14 \\leq k \\leq 14$ | $-25 \\leq k \\leq 25$ |\n|  | $-16 \\leq l \\leq 16$ | $-16 \\leq l \\leq 16$ |\n| Reflections collected | 12589 | 22131 |\n| Independent reflections | $5183\\left(R_{\\mathrm{int}}=0.0325\\right)$ | $4451\\left(R_{\\mathrm{int}}=0.0461\\right)$ |\n| Refinement method | Full-matrix least-squares on $F^{2}$ | Full-matrix least-squares on $F^{2}$ |\n| Data/restraints/parameters | $5183 / 0 / 343$ | $4451 / 0 / 289$ |\n| Goodness-of-fit on $F^{2}$ | 1.061 | 1.025 |\n| Final $R$ indices $[I>2 \\sigma(I)]$ | $R_{1}=0.0399, w R_{2}=0.1044$ | $R_{1}=0.0438, w R_{2}=0.1120$ |\n| $R$ indices (all data) | $R_{1}=0.0461, w R_{2}=0.1097$ | $R_{1}=0.0581, w R_{2}=0.1208$ |\n\nTable 2\n\nSelected bond lengths $(\\AA)$ and angles $\\left({ }^{\\circ}\\right)$ for $\\mathbf{1}$ and $\\mathbf{2}$.\n\n| $\\mathbf{1}$ |  | $\\mathbf{2}$ |  |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $\\mathrm{Sm}(1)-\\mathrm{N}(1)$ | $2.358(4)$ | $\\mathrm{Sm}(1)-\\mathrm{N}(1)$ | $2.367(4)$ |\n| $\\mathrm{Sm}(1)-\\mathrm{N}(2)$ | $2.364(4)$ | $\\mathrm{Sm}(1)-\\mathrm{N}(2)$ | $2.362(4)$ |\n| $\\mathrm{Sm}(1)-\\mathrm{N}(3)$ | $2.362(4)$ | $\\mathrm{Sm}(1)-\\mathrm{N}(3)$ | $2.362(4)$ |\n| $\\mathrm{N}(1)-\\mathrm{Sm}(1)-\\mathrm{N}(2)$ | $68.33(13)$ | $\\mathrm{N}(1)-\\mathrm{Sm}(1)-\\mathrm{N}(2)$ | $67.72(13)$ |\n| $\\mathrm{N}(1)-\\mathrm{Sm}(1)-\\mathrm{N}(3)$ | $126.45(14)$ | $\\mathrm{N}(1)-\\mathrm{Sm}(1)-\\mathrm{N}(3)$ | $126.57(13)$ |\n| $\\mathrm{N}(2)-\\mathrm{Sm}(1)-\\mathrm{N}(3)$ | $68.62(13)$ | $\\mathrm{N}(2)-\\mathrm{Sm}(1)-\\mathrm{N}(3)$ | $68.62(13)$ |\n| $\\mathrm{N}(1)-\\mathrm{Sm}(1)-\\mathrm{C}(1)$ | $162.1(2)$ | $\\mathrm{N}(1)-\\mathrm{Sm}(1)-\\mathrm{C}(1)$ | $162.6(2)$ |\n| $\\mathrm{N}(2)-\\mathrm{Sm}(1)-\\mathrm{C}(1)$ | $91.1(2)$ | $\\mathrm{N}(2)-\\mathrm{Sm}(1)-\\mathrm{C}(1)$ | $91.9(2)$ |\n| $\\mathrm{N}(3)-\\mathrm{Sm}(1)-\\mathrm{C}(1)$ | $105.1(2)$ | $\\mathrm{N}(3)-\\mathrm{Sm}(1)-\\mathrm{C}(1)$ | $104.8(2)$ |\n\n## 4. Conclusion\n\nIn summary, we have synthesized and characterized two new samarium(III) complexes supported by $\\beta$-diketiminato ligands. The complexes show good catalytic activity for the polymerization of MMA, producing PMMA with high molecular weights and narrow polydispersity indices. The catalytic activity of the complexes is influenced by the steric hindrance around the samarium center, with the more sterically hindered complex showing higher activity. The results suggest that the complexes have potential as catalysts for the polymerization of MMA.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nWe are grateful to the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 21374041) and the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (Grant No. BK20130256) for financial support.\n\n## Appendix A.

Chen.\n\n    ${ }^{\\text {ht }}$ is a $p$-group and $\\left|G: G_{1}\\right|=q^{n}$ where $q$ is a prime different from $p$. Then $G$ is $p$-nilpotent.\n\nProof. We proceed by induction on $|G|$. Let $P \\in \\operatorname{Syl}_{p}(G)$. Then $P \\cap G_{1} \\in \\operatorname{Syl}_{p}\\left(G_{1}\\right)$ and so $P \\cap G_{1} \\unlhd G_{1}$. If $P \\cap G_{1}=P$, then $P \\leq G_{1}$ so that $P \\unlhd G$ and $G$ is $p$-nilpotent. Thus we may assume that $P \\cap G_{1}<P$. Let $N=N_{G}(P)$. Then $N<G$ and so $N$ is $p$-nilpotent by induction. Thus $N_{P}(P \\cap$ $\\left.G_{1}\\right)=N_{G}(P) \\cap P=P$ so that $P \\cap G_{1} \\unlhd P$. Hence there exists $x \\in N_{P}\\left(P \\cap G_{1}\\right)-$ $C_{P}\\left(P \\cap G_{1}\\right)$. Since $x \\in P$, we have $x \\in N_{G}\\left(P \\cap G_{1}\\right)=N_{G}\\left(G_{1}\\right)$. Thus $x \\in N_{G}\\left(G_{1}\\right) \\cap$ $P \\leq N_{G}\\left(G_{1}\\right) \\cap N_{G}(P)=N_{G}\\left(P \\cap G_{1}\\right)$ and so $x \\in N_{G}\\left(P \\cap G_{1}\\right)=N_{G}\\left(G_{1} \\cap P\\right)$. Hence $x \\in C_{G}\\left(G_{1} \\cap P\\right)$ so that $x \\in C_{G}(P \\cap G)$. Since $P \\cap G_{1} \\leq P$, we have $x \\in C_{G}(P)$ and so $x \\in Z(P)$. Thus $x \\in Z(P) \\cap N_{G}(P)$ and so $x \\in C_{G}(Z(P))$. Hence $G$ is $p$-nilpotent, a contradiction.\n\nThe following is a generalization of a well-known result of Frobenius.\n\nTHEOREM 3.4. Let $G$ be a finite group and $H$ a subgroup of $G$ such that $|G: H|=n$. If $n$ is odd and $H$ is $S_{4}$-free, then $G$ is $S_{4}$-free.\n\nProof. Suppose that $G$ is not $S_{4}$-free. Then $G$ contains a subgroup $K$ isomorphic to $S_{4}$. Let $T$ be a 2-Sylow subgroup of $K$. Then $T$ is a 2 -subgroup of $G$ and $|T|=8$. Let $P$ be a 2-Sylow subgroup of $G$ containing $T$. Then $T \\leq P$ and $T$ is normal in $P$ since $P$ is a 2-group. Hence $N_{G}(T) \\geq P$. Now $P$ contains an element $x$ of order $n$. Thus $x \\in N_{G}(T)$ and so $x T x^{-1}=T$. Hence $T \\unlhd G$ and so $K \\leq N_{G}(T)$. This implies that $T \\unlhd K$. But then $T$ is normal in a Sylow 2-subgroup of $K$ and so $T$ is contained in a Sylow 2-subgroup of $G$. This contradicts Lagrange's Theorem.\n\n## 4. $p$-Nilpotent Groups\n\nIn this section we investigate the structure of $p$-nilpotent groups. We begin with the following result of Frobenius.\n\nTHEOREM 4.1 (Frobenius). Let $G$ be a finite group and $H$ a subgroup of $G$ such that $x H x^{-1} \\cap H=\\{1\\}$ for all $x \\in G \\backslash H$. Then $G$ has a normal complement to $H$.\n\nThe following is an immediate consequence of Frobenius' Theorem.\n\nCOROLLARY 4.2. Let $G$ be a finite group and $H$ a subgroup of $G$ such that $H$ has odd order and $H \\cap H^{x}=\\{1\\}$ for all $x \\in G \\backslash H$. Then $G=H \\rtimes K$ for some subgroup $K$ of $G$.\n\nThe following is a partial converse to Frobenius' Theorem.\n\nTHEOREM 4.3. Let $G$ be a finite group and $H$ a subgroup of $G$ such that $x H x^{-1} \\cap H=\\{1\\}$ for all $x \\in G \\backslash H$. Suppose that $|G: H|$ and $|H|$ are relatively prime. Then $H$ is normal in $G$.\n\nProof. Let $x \\in G$ and $h \\in H$. Then $x h x^{-1} \\in H$ and so $x h x^{-1} \\in H$. Hence $x^{-1} H x \\subseteq H$. Since $x$ was arbitrary, $H$ is normal in $G$.\n\nThe following is a generalization of Frobenius' Theorem.\n\nTHEOREM 4.4. Let $G$ be a finite group and $H$ a subgroup of $G$ such that $H \\cap H^{x}=\\{1\\}$ for all $x \\in G \\backslash N_{G}(H)$. Then $G=N_{G}(H) \\cdot H$.\n\nProof. Let $T=\\left\\{x \\in G \\mid x H x^{-1}=H\\right\\}$. Then $T=N_{G}(H)$. Let $x \\in G$. Then $x H x^{-1}=H$ if and only if $x \\in T$. Hence $x H x^{-1} \\cap H=\\{1\\}$ if $x \\notin T$. Let $y \\in G \\backslash T$. Then $y^{-1} H y \\cap H=\\{1\\}$ and so $y^{-1} \\notin H$. Hence $y^{-1} \\notin T$ and $T \\cap y T y^{-1}=\\{1\\}$. Hence $y \\notin T$ and so $G=T \\cdot H$. Thus $G=N_{G}(H) \\cdot H$.\n\nCOROLLARY 4.5. Let $G$ be a finite group and $H$ a subgroup of $G$ such that $H$ is a TI-set in $G$. Then $G=N_{G}(H) \\cdot H$.\n\nThe following result is useful in determining whether a given group is $p$-nilpotent.\n\nTHEOREM 4.6 (Frobenius). Let $G$ be a finite group and $p$ a prime dividing $|G|$. Suppose that for every $p$-subgroup $P$ of $G$ we have $N_{G}(P)=C_{G}(P)$. Then $G$ has a normal $p$-complement.\n\nThe following is a generalization of Frobenius' Theorem.\n\nTHEOREM 4.7 (Thompson). Let $G$ be a finite group and $p$ a prime. Suppose that $N_{G}(P)=C_{G}(P)$ for every $p$-subgroup $P$ of $G$. Then $G$ has a normal $p$-complement.\n\n## 5. Supersolvable Groups\n\nA finite group $G$ is said to be supersolvable if it has a normal series with cyclic factors. The following result gives several characterizations of supersolvable groups.\n\nTHEOREM 5.1. The following are equivalent for a finite group $G$.\n\n1. $G$ is supersolvable.\n2. Every maximal subgroup of $G$ has prime index in $G$.\n3. $G / \\Phi(G)$ is supersolvable.\n\nProof. (1) $\\Rightarrow$ (2) Suppose that $G$ is supersolvable and let $M$ be a maximal subgroup of $G$. Then there exists a normal series\n\n$$\n\\{1\\}=G_{0}<G_{1}<\\cdots<G_{n}=G\n$$\n\nsuch that $G_{i} \\triangleleft G$ for $0 \\leq i \\leq n$. Since $M$ is maximal, there exists $i$ such that $M=G_{i}$. Then $G / M \\cong G_{i+1} / G_{i}$ is simple and cyclic. Hence $[G: M]$ is prime.\n\n(2) $\\Rightarrow$ (3) Let $M$ be a maximal subgroup of $G$. Then $[G: M]$ is prime and so $M$ is normal in $G$. Hence $G / M$ is simple and cyclic. Thus $G$ is supersolvable.\n\n(3) $\\Rightarrow$ (1) Let $G$ be a minimal counterexample. Then $G$ is not supersolvable and so there exists a non-normal maximal subgroup $M$ of $G$. Let $x \\in G \\backslash M$. Then $G=\\langle x, M\\rangle$. Since $x \\notin M$, we have $G=\\langle x\\rangle M$. Let $y$ be an element of maximal order in $M$. Then $C_{G}(y)$ contains $\\langle x, y\\rangle$. Hence $C_{G}(y)=G$ and so $y \\in Z(G)$. But then $M$ is normal in $G$, a contradiction.\n\nCOROLLARY 5.2. Let $G$ be a finite group. Then $G$ is supersolvable if and only if every maximal subgroup of $G$ has prime index.\n\n## 6. $P$-Stable Groups\n\nLet $p$ be a prime and $P$ be a $p$-subgroup of $G$. Then $P$ is $p$-stable if for every $x \\in N_{G}(P)$, $x$ induces a $p$-automorphism on $P$. A group $G$ is $p$-stable if every $p$-subgroup of $G$ is $p$-stable.\n\nTHEOREM 6.1 (Glauberman). Let $p$ be an odd prime and $P$ a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$. Suppose that $P$ is abelian. Then $G$ is $p$-stable if and only if $O_{p^{\\prime}}(G)=C_{G}(Z(P))$.\n\n## 7. $P$-Closed Groups\n\nA group $G$ is $p$-closed if it has a normal Sylow $p$-subgroup. The following result characterizes $p$-closed groups.\n\nTHEOREM 7.1 (Burnside). Let $G$ be a group and $P$ a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$. Then $G$ is $p$-closed if and only if $N_{G}(P)=C_{G}(P)$.\n\nCOROLLARY 7.2. Let $P$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$. If $P \\leq Z\\left(N_{G}(P)\\right)$, then $P$ is normal in $G$.\n\n## 8. $P$-Complements\n\nLet $P$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$. A subgroup $H$ of $G$ is a $p$-complement if $H$ is of index $p^{n}$ in $G$ for some $n$. A $p$-complement $H$ is normal if $H^{g}=H$ for all $g \\in G$. A group $G$ is $p$-nilpotent if it has a normal $p$-complement.\n\nTHEOREM 8.1 (Frobenius). Let $P$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$. Then $G$ is $p$-nilpotent if and only if $N_{G}(P)=C_{G}(P)$.\n\nCOROLLARY 8.2. Let $P$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$. If $P \\leq Z\\left(N_{G}(P)\\right)$, then $G$ is $p$-nilpotent.\n\n## 9. Transfer and Normal Complements\n\nLet $G$ be a group and $H$ a subgroup of $G$. The transfer of $G$ into $H$ is a homomorphism from $G$ into $H / H^{\\prime}$ defined by $V_{H}^{G}(g)=H g H^{\\prime}$.\n\nTHEOREM 9.1 (Transfer Theorem). Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$ and suppose that $V_{H}^{G}(g)=H$ for all $g \\in G$. Then $H$ is normal in $G$.\n\nCOROLLARY 9.2. Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$ and suppose that $H$ is abelian. If $H \\cap H^{g}=1$ for all $g \\in G \\backslash H$, then $H$ is normal in $G$.\n\n## 10. The Baer-Suzuki Theorem\n\nTHEOREM 10.1 (Baer-Suzuki). Let $X$ be a $p$-subgroup of $G$. If $X$ is $p$-closed in $G$, then $X$ is normal in $G$.\n\nCOROLLARY 10.2. Let $X$ be a $p$-subgroup of $G$. If $N_{G}(X)=C_{G}(X)$, then $X$ is normal in $G$.\n\n## 11. The Focal Subgroup Theorem\n\nTHEOREM 11.1. Let $P$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$. Then $P \\cap G^{\\prime}=P \\cap N_{G}(P)^{\\prime}$.\n\nCOROLLARY 11.2. Let $P$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$. If $P$ is abelian, then $P \\cap G^{\\prime}=1$.\n\n## 12. The Wielandt Automorphism Theorem\n\nTHEOREM 12.1 (Wielandt). Let $G$ be a group and $A$ a subgroup of $A u t(G)$. Suppose that $A$ fixes every element of $G$ that is fixed by every element of $A$. Then $A$ is contained in the group of inner automorphisms of $G$.\n\n## Exercises\n\n## EXERCISES FOR CHAPTER 1\n\n1.1. Let $G$ be a finite group and $H$ a subgroup of $G$. Prove that the number of left cosets of $H$ in $G$ is equal to the number of right cosets of $H$ in $G$.\n\n1.2. Let $H$ and $K$ be subgroups of a group $G$. Prove that $H K$ is a subgroup of $G$ if and only if $H K=K H$.\n\n1.3. Let $H$ and $K$ be subgroups of a group $G$ such that $H K=G$. Prove that $H \\cap K=\\{1\\}$ if and only if $H$ and $K$ are the only subgroups of $G$ that contain $H \\cap K$ as a subgroup.\n\n## EXERCISES FOR CHAPTER 2\n\n2.1.
