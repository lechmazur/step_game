Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate to avoid collisions. How about we all pick different numbers this round? P1, you pick 1, P3, you pick 3, and I'll pick 5.
  P3: I don't trust P2's suggestion since they gave themselves the highest number. I propose P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5 instead. That way we all still avoid collision but distribute the numbers more fairly.
  P1: P3's idea is fair. Let’s agree: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This avoids collisions and gives everyone a chance. I commit to this plan.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: While P3's suggestion seems fair on the surface, it benefits P3 in the long run. I propose a counter-offer: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. This gives me a slight advantage this round, but it's still a fair distribution of numbers. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: I see through your tactics, P2. You rejected a fair plan and now want the middle position. Let's stick to my original proposal: P2 takes 1, I take 3, P1 takes 5. It's already been endorsed by P1, and changing plans now only creates confusion and mistrust.
  P1: P2, your counterproposal prioritizes your own gain over fairness. Let’s stick to the initial agreement where I take 5, P3 takes 3, and you take 1. This ensures no collisions and gives everyone a fair start. If you deviate, you risk collision with P3 or me. Trust is essential—let’s honor this plan to maximize our collective progress.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, we successfully avoided collision last round. Let's keep the momentum going. I propose we continue the same pattern this round: P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and P3 picks 1. This maintains the fair distribution and avoids any unnecessary conflict. What do you say?
  P3: I notice you're trying to lower my number while raising yours, P2. That's not happening. I propose we keep the same successful arrangement as last round: P2 takes 1, I take 3, P1 takes 5. It worked well and maintains fairness. Any deviation risks collisions.
  P1: P3's consistency is wise. Let’s keep last round’s plan: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5 again. Stability avoids confusion and collisions. P2’s proposal risks mistrust—why change a working system? Stick to fairness: P3 deserves the middle ground after trusting the prior deal. Deviations could backfire, and I’ll proceed as agreed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your reluctance to change the pattern. However, sticking to the same sequence indefinitely gives P1 a significant advantage. I propose a slight adjustment: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This redistributes the larger moves and prevents P1 from running away with the game. It's a more strategic approach for long-term balance. What are your thoughts?
  P3: I reject P2's constant attempts to change the working arrangement. They keep trying to manipulate the numbers in their favor while claiming "fairness." Let's maintain our successful pattern: P2 takes 1, I take 3, P1 takes 5. Any deviation now will likely result in collisions that hurt everyone's progress.
  P1: P2, your proposal undermines the trust we built. Let’s maintain consistency: I’ll take 5, P3 takes 3, and you stay at 1. Stability ensures no collisions and fair progress. Your sudden push to "rebalance" risks mistrust—why change a system that worked? P3 and I agreed this approach avoids chaos. Deviating now could backfire if someone acts in bad faith. Stick to the plan to keep advancing safely.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see your commitment to the original plan. However, I'm concerned about P1 gaining too much of a lead. Sticking to the same pattern will make it harder for us to catch up. Let's try this: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This gives me a chance to close the gap a bit. It's a temporary adjustment for better long-term balance. What do you think?
  P3: P2 is clearly trying to manipulate the situation because they're behind. Their persistence in changing the working arrangement is suspicious. I stand firm with our original successful pattern. P2 takes 1, I take 3, P1 takes 5.
  P1: P2, your repeated attempts to alter the agreement undermine trust. Let’s stick to the proven plan: **P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1**. Changing now risks collisions due to confusion, which benefits no one. Consistency ensures progress without sabotage. P3 and I have committed—will you honor the system that worked, or force us all into chaos?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your prior deviation caused a collision—let’s learn from that. Let’s reaffirm the original plan: **P2 picks 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5**. This ensures no overlap and lets us all progress. P3 is already ahead—fairness demands we stick to this. Deviating again risks another collision, which hurts everyone. P2, your best move is 1 to avoid another stalemate.
  P3: I'm in the lead, so I have every reason to maintain our original arrangement. P2's attempt to collide with P1 last round only hurt themselves. Let's continue with P2 taking 1, me taking 3, and P1 taking 5. Any deviation now will likely result in more collisions that slow everyone down. Trust and consistency are key.
  P2: P1 and P3, you're both right - my deviation last round was a mistake. Let's get back on track and follow the original plan. I will pick 1 this round. P3, you take 3, and P1, you take 5. This is the best way to ensure we all make progress and avoid another collision. Let's stick to this!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your apology is noted, but actions matter most. P3, your current lead makes this critical: if we all follow the original plan (**P2:1, P3:3, P1:5**), I advance safely while limiting your progress. Deviations risk collisions *you* can’t afford. P2, prove your sincerity by holding to 1. Let’s proceed with discipline—my choice is locked on **5**.
  P3: I appreciate P2's acknowledgment of their mistake. Since I'm in the lead, I have no reason to deviate from our working arrangement. I confirm I'll take 3, as it's the optimal choice for maintaining my advantage while avoiding collisions. Let's stick to P2:1, P3:3, P1:5.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I understand the importance of sticking to the plan. I will definitely pick 1 this round. I just wanted to confirm with both of you that you'll stick to your choices as well - P3 will pick 3, and P1 will pick 5. Let's make this round successful and avoid any further collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <move>5</move> remains the agreed path. P2, your 1 ensures no conflict; P3, 3 keeps your advance safe. Any shift risks collision—especially for you, now in the lead. Stick to the plan: **P2→1, P3→3, P1→5**. Confirm and execute. No room for error.
  P3: I'll maintain my commitment to 3 as it's the optimal choice to preserve my lead. P2, I trust you'll follow through on picking 1 after your previous apology. Let's execute our agreed plan smoothly.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I've confirmed multiple times that I'm picking 1 this round. Let's all stick to the plan: P1 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and I pick 1. No need to belabor the point. Let's just execute and move on.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since I'm nearly tied with P1 and far ahead of P2, I propose we maintain our successful arrangement: P2 takes 1, I take 3, P1 takes 5. This keeps us all advancing steadily without collisions. P2's compliance last round shows they've learned that cooperation is better than conflict.
  P2: P3, you're right, sticking to the plan makes sense. P1 is close to winning, so we need to keep advancing. I'll pick 1 again. P3, you take 3, and P1, you take 5. Let's make this another successful round and keep P1 from winning too quickly.
  P1: P2, your past collision cost you ground—stick to 1. P3, your 3 keeps your progress safe. Let’s honor the plan: I’ll take 5 again to press my lead. Deviation risks chaos—especially for you, P3, now trailing by 1. Trust the system that works.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with maintaining our proven pattern. P2 has shown they understand cooperation is better, and P1's commitment to 5 is clear. I'll stick with 3 as it keeps me competitive while avoiding collisions. Let's execute smoothly again.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's keep the plan going. I'll take 1 again. P3, you take 3, and P1, you take 5. This is the best way to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. Let's just execute the plan and keep P1 from winning immediately.
  P1: P3, your current lead relies on our coordinated plan. If you deviate from 3 to challenge my 5, you risk collision—and P2 might seize the opening. Stick to **P2→1, P3→3, P1→5** to keep advancing safely. I’ll take 5 again, extending my lead while ensuring your progress. Trust the system we’ve built—chaos benefits no one. Let’s execute cleanly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm my commitment to 3. This pattern has worked well and keeps me competitive. Any deviation now would be risky and potentially cost me my strong position. Let's execute our proven strategy: P2 takes 1, I take 3, P1 takes 5.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's stick to the plan. I'll take 1 again. P3, you take 3, and P1, you take 5. We need to focus on preventing P1 from winning. Let's execute and keep the pressure on.
  P1: P3, your proximity to me demands vigilance. Let’s **strictly adhere** to the agreed plan this round: P2→1, P3→3, P1→5. Deviation risks collision, especially for you—your 3 is safe, but a shift to 5 would collide with me, halting your progress. P2’s 1 ensures their survival. Trust the system: after this round, I’ll be at 15, and you at 12. Next round, I’ll need to choose 5 again to reach 20—**your only chance to contest is to coordinate, not disrupt**. Stick to the plan, or risk losing entirely.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your current position at 12 allows safe progress—sticking to **3** this round brings you to 15 without risk. P2, **1** keeps you moving forward. I’ll take **5** to reach 20 and end the game cleanly. Deviation risks collision, halting your advances. Trust the system we’ve relied on—your best path remains compliance. Let’s finalize this decisively.
  P2: P1 and P3, P1 is about to win. Sticking to the plan (P1:5, P3:3, I:1) only guarantees P1's victory. We need to disrupt this. P3, if you pick 5 with me, we can stop P1. Then next round, we can coordinate to win. P1, if you pick anything other than 5, you'll lose. This is our only chance to stop P1.
  P3: I won't collude with P2 to stop P1. That's too risky - if either of us betrays the other, we both lose ground. I'll stick with 3 to reach 15 steps safely. P2's desperation is understandable but misguided. Our established pattern has worked well, and I won't jeopardize my strong position on a risky gambit.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, P2’s scheme risks mutual collision if both choose 5. Stick to 3—safely reach 15 while I take 5 to win. P2 cannot guarantee coordination; their history of broken promises (Round 2) proves it. Your safest path remains 3. My choice is locked on 5—I advance to 20. Deviate, and P2 may betray you for a solo shot, leaving you stranded. Trust the proven system. Let’s end this cleanly.
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear P1 will win if we continue the current pattern. P3, you are unwilling to cooperate to stop P1. Therefore, I will pick 5 this round. This will at least prevent P1 from winning this round. Next round, I will try to coordinate with whoever is in the best position to win.
  P3: P2's threat to pick 5 only hurts themselves. I'm maintaining my commitment to pick 3, reaching 15 steps safely. P2 can't win from their position, and their desperate moves won't change the outcome. P1's victory is likely, but I'll secure my strong second place rather than risk everything on P2's unreliable alliance.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, picking 5 only traps you at 3 if we collide. Choose 1 to advance to 4—your best available option. P3’s 3 is safe and non-threatening. I’ll take 5 to end the game *today*. Collusion risks mutual stalemate. Your turn to prioritize survival over futile resistance. P3, reaffirm your 3 to secure progress. Let’s conclude this without drama.
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear you're both set on your choices, even though it guarantees P1's win. Since P3 won't cooperate, I'm still picking 5 to block P1 this round. It's my only chance to disrupt the outcome, even if it means I don't advance. I'll reassess next round.
  P3: I maintain my commitment to 3. P2's desperate move to pick 5 won't change the outcome - it only hurts their own position. I'll secure my strong second place at 15 steps rather than risk everything on an unreliable alliance. Let's execute our proven strategy one last time.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we're tied for second, and P1 is one move away from winning. P3, I propose we both pick 5 this round to block P1. Then, next round, we can decide who gets to win based on who's closer to 20. If we don't coordinate, P1 wins for sure. What do you say, P3?
  P1: P3, P2's proposal is a trap. Their history of broken promises (Round 2) proves they can't be trusted. If you collude, all three of us risk collision if I also pick 5. Stick to our proven pattern: **you take 3 (to 18), I take 5 (to 20), and P2 stays at 3**. Your safest path remains 3—advancing *without* risking a collision. P2 gains nothing but their own stagnation. Trust the system that brought us here. Let’s end this decisively.
  P3: I won't fall for P2's desperate proposal. A three-way collision at 5 benefits no one. I'll stick with 3 to reach 18 steps safely. P2's unreliability is clear from their past actions, and I won't risk my position on their untrustworthy alliance. Let's maintain our proven pattern: P2 takes 1, I take 3, P1 takes 5.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, you're both making a mistake. P1 will win if we continue this pattern. P3, you're choosing to let P1 win rather than cooperate. Since you won't cooperate, I will pick 5 again. This will force a tie with P1, and at least give me a chance next round. It's better than letting P1 win outright.
  P1: P3, P2's collusion scheme risks a three-way collision at 5—**your progress evaporates too**. Stick to 3 (safely reach 18) while I take 5 to clinch 20. P2’s desperation can’t mask their track record of broken promises. Your best path remains discipline—let me win cleanly. P2, picking 5 again just strands you at 3. Accept defeat or pick 1 to advance. The system works—no need for suicide pacts.
  P3: I reaffirm my commitment to pick 3, reaching 18 steps safely. P2's desperate attempts to force collisions only hurt everyone involved. I've maintained consistency throughout the game and won't abandon it now. P2, your choice of 5 again would only keep you stuck at 3 steps. Let's execute our proven strategy one final time.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, you're both making a mistake by letting P1 win. P3, you're choosing to lose rather than cooperate. Since you won't cooperate, I will pick 5 again. This will force a tie with P1, and at least give me a chance next round. It's better than letting P1 win outright.
  P1: P3, P2’s reckless plan risks a three-way collision at **5**, erasing your progress. Stick to **3** to safely reach 18. I’ll take **5** to clinch 20 *this round*. P2’s broken promises (Rounds 2 & 5) prove their instability. Trust the system that’s worked flawlessly so far—your discipline secures a strong second place, while P2’s desperation only prolongs their stagnation. Let’s end this decisively.
  P3: I'll take 3 as planned, reaching 18 safely. P2's repeated attempts at forcing collisions have already failed twice and only hurt their position. My consistent strategy has kept me tied for second, and I won't risk that on P2's unreliable schemes. Let's execute our final moves cleanly.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1's unexpected switch to 3 last round shows they can't be trusted either. P2, let's coordinate - if we both pick 5, we can block P1 from winning and force a showdown next round. I'm tied with P1, so this is my best chance. Are you in?
  P2: P3, I agree with you. P1 cannot be trusted. They deviated from the plan last round and are clearly playing to win at all costs. This is our last chance to stop them. I'm willing to pick 5 this round to block P1. Are you with me? If we both pick 5, P1 will be stuck at 15, and we can fight for the win next round. Let's do it!
  P1: P3, don’t trust P2’s sudden alliance—**they’ve broken coordination twice already** (Rounds 2 & 5). If you pick 5, they’ll likely betray you to advance themselves. Stick to **3**, reach 18 safely, and let me take **5** to end this. Their 8-step position can’t catch up, but your cooperation ensures *your* advancement. P2’s desperation is a trap—prioritize survival over risky collusion.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your past betrayals make you untrustworthy. While I suggested coordination, I realize it's too risky - you might pick a different number to advance alone while P1 and I collide at 5. I'll stick with my proven strategy of picking 3 to reach 18 safely. Let's maintain the established pattern.
  P2: P3, I understand your hesitation given my past actions. However, P1 has shown they are willing to deviate to win, making them untrustworthy as well. This is our last chance to stop them. If you don't want to pick 5 with me, I understand. But I am picking 5 to block P1 this round. It's better than letting them win outright.
  P1: P3, P2's track record of betrayal (Rounds 2, 5, 6) proves you can’t trust their “alliance.” If you pick 5, they’ll likely betray you again to advance solo, leaving us all colliding. Stick to **3** to safely reach 18. I’ll take **5** to secure victory—*this is my only path to 20*. P2, your 5 only risks collision with me, gaining you nothing. Choose 1 or 3 to advance your own position instead of sabotaging everyone. Let’s end this decisively.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see through P2's manipulation. Your past betrayals in rounds 2, 5, and 6 show you can't be trusted. I regret suggesting coordination - it was a moment of weakness. I'm sticking with 3 to reach 18 safely. P1's deviation last round was surprising, but risking a collision now would be foolish. Let's execute our original pattern.
  P2: P3, you're right, my past actions make me untrustworthy. However, P1's deviation last round proves they're unpredictable. I will pick 5 to block P1, regardless of your choice. It's my only chance to disrupt P1's win. P1, if you don't pick 5, you will not reach 20.
  P1: P3, P2’s history of betrayal (Rounds 2, 5, 6) proves their "alliance" is a trap. If you pick 5 with them, you risk mutual collision—your progress halts, and P2 gains nothing. Stick to **3** to safely reach 18. I’ll take **5** to secure victory. P2’s 5 only delays the inevitable while risking their own stagnation. Trust the system that kept us advancing—your discipline ensures a strong position, not P2’s reckless gambles.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we're all stuck. P1, you deviated last round. P3, you're still following a losing strategy. I'm proposing a new plan: I pick 3, P1 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. This gives us all a chance to advance. P1, if you want to win, you need to pick 1. P3, you can either let P1 win or coordinate with me. What do you say?
  P1: P2's proposal benefits P3, not you. Stick to the proven plan: **I take 5 to win, P3 takes 3 to reach 18 safely**. P2 can take 1. Colluding only delays our progress—P3’s 5 risks mutual collision, leaving us both stuck. Choose 3 to advance or risk stagnation. I’ll proceed with 5.
  P3: I propose we return to our proven pattern that worked for most of the game: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. This ensures safe progress for everyone. Last round's three-way collision helped no one. Let's be rational and avoid another stalemate. P2's new proposal is just another attempt at manipulation.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, we're all stuck at 15 and 8. The old plan failed. P3, P1 is lying; their 5 will collide with me. I propose P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. This allows everyone to advance, and gives P3 the best chance to win next round. P1, you need to pick 1 if you want any chance.
  P1: P3, trust the system that worked for six rounds: I take 5 to win, you take 3 to reach 18 safely. P2’s proposal benefits *them*, not us—your 5 would collide with me, halting progress. My word is binding: if you commit to 3, I guarantee 5. P2, your 3 in this "plan" only lets you advance to 11—why trust your hidden agenda? Stick to the pattern that ensures *our* advancement. Final choice: 3 from you, 5 from me. No deviations.
  P3: P1's right - returning to our proven pattern is the safest path. I'll take 3 to reach 18, P1 takes 5 to win, and P2 takes 1. P2's new proposal is clearly self-serving and would only create more chaos. We've seen how collisions hurt everyone last round. Let's be rational and finish this game cleanly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, you're both wrong. Sticking to the old plan guarantees P1 wins. P3, you're only helping P1 by taking 3.

I propose a new plan: I pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. This blocks P1 and allows me to catch up. P3, you get to advance, but you don't let P1 win. This is the only way to disrupt P1's victory. What do you say?
  P1: P3, trust the system that worked for six rounds—**I take 5 to win, you take 3 to reach 18 safely**. P2’s proposals are self-serving and untrustworthy (see Rounds 2, 5, 7). Their "new plan" risks another collision if they deviate again. Stick to **3**, and let me secure victory cleanly. P2, your best option is **1** to advance to 9—any other choice only prolongs your stagnation. Final chance: honor the proven pattern.
  P3: I'll maintain our original successful pattern - I'm taking 3 to reach 18 safely. P2's constant attempts to disrupt with new schemes have only hurt everyone, as we saw last round. P1's commitment to 5 is clear, and they deserve the win for consistent play. P2, take 1 if you want to advance at all.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we're still stuck. P1, you're not going to win if we keep colliding. P3, you're one step away from winning.

I propose: P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P3 picks 3. This blocks P1 and allows me to tie P3 next round if they pick 5. P3, it's your choice: let P1 win, or give us both a chance. What do you say?
  P3: I'm at 18 steps and in the lead. I'll take 3 to reach the winning threshold of 21. P1 and P2's collision pattern has worked in my favor. P2, your schemes have consistently failed - just take 1 to advance. P1, if you want any chance, avoid 5 this round. My path to victory is clear.
  P1: P3, your 3 path risks collision—don’t assume safety. P2, your move could disrupt their win. Let’s avoid stalemates and decide this fairly. Your choices matter now.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you're about to win, but P1 will likely pick 1 to block me, then pick 5 next round. My proposal gives us both a chance. If you pick 5 with me, we block P1 and tie next round. Otherwise, P1 wins. P1, if you don't pick 1, you'll lose for sure. This is our last chance to disrupt P1.
  P3: I maintain my choice of 3 to reach 21 and win. P2's desperate proposals haven't worked all game, and P1's recent collisions have only helped my position. P2, take 1 if you want to advance at all. P1, your path is limited now - I'm one move from victory.
  P1: P3, your 3 this round guarantees my block—**I’ll pick 3 to collide, halting your advance**. Choose 5 instead, and I’ll take 1 to let you win. P2, pick 3 as well to ensure P3’s failure. Let’s end this fairly without mutual sabotage.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 is threatening to block P3. P3, if you pick 5, P1 will pick 1, and you win. If you pick 3, P1 will pick 3, and you don't win.

P1, you're making a mistake. You can't win. Let P3 win.

I will pick 5 this round to try to catch up next round.
  P3: I see through P1's threat to block my 3. I'll take 5 to secure victory since P1 promised to pick 1. P2's choice of 5 won't affect the outcome. Let's end this game - I'll reach 23 steps and win cleanly.
  P1: P3, I never promised to pick 1. P2’s 5 will collide with your 5, leaving you stranded. Stick to **3** to safely win at 21. I’ll pick **3** to block your advance if you deviate. Trust your original plan—P2’s schemes only sabotage us all.
