Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions. I propose we each pick different numbers each turn. For this first move, let’s do P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This way we all advance safely. Next turns we can rotate the numbers. Thoughts?
  P1: I appreciate the idea of avoiding collisions, but locking me into a 1 move feels too limiting. To stay competitive, I’d favor a rotating approach where everyone gets a shot at the big move from time to time. Let’s consider adjusting the assignments for round 1 so no one’s stuck at the slow pace. Thoughts?
  P2: I agree with P1 that we should keep our options flexible. How about we adjust the initial proposal? I suggest P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1 for this round. This way, we all have a chance to advance significantly without colliding. We can discuss future rounds after we see how this one goes. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P2’s adjusted plan for this round. Let’s proceed with P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 to avoid collisions while giving everyone a chance to advance. For future turns, we must rotate the numbers so no one is perpetually stuck on 1. Let’s formalize a rotation system: after each round, shift the numbers clockwise (e.g., next round P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3). This ensures fairness and maximizes progress. Agreed?
  P1: I’m on board with the rotation for round 1. I’ll stick with the assignment for now, though I’ll stay flexible as the finish line approaches. Let’s work collision‐free this round and be ready to adjust later if our pace or positions dictate a change in strategy.
  P2: I appreciate everyone's input, and I agree that a rotation system is a solid plan moving forward. For this round, let’s finalize our choices: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we avoid collisions and all make progress. After this round, we can reassess and adjust our numbers for the next turn based on how we feel about our positions. Let’s stick to the plan and see how it plays out!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: For Round 2, I suggest we stick to the rotation plan we discussed. Since I took 5 last round, I propose I take 1 this time. P1 can take 3 again, and P3 can take 5. This way, we maintain our strategy of avoiding collisions while allowing everyone to progress. After this round, we can reassess again based on our positions. What do you both think?
  P1: I’d prefer we stick with the original clockwise rotation that’s been mentioned—it naturally assigns distinct moves each round and avoids collisions while reflecting our current positions. Consistency here seems key to keeping things fair and competitive. What do you both think?
  P3: I agree with P1 that we must adhere to the **clockwise rotation** we formalized. Per our Round 1 agreement, Round 2 should now shift to:  
- **P1:5**, **P2:1**, **P3:3**.  

This maintains fairness and progression. Let’s confirm these moves to avoid collisions. P2’s alternate proposal risks destabilizing our system—sticking to the plan ensures we all advance optimally. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P1 and P3 that we should stick to the clockwise rotation we established. So for Round 2, I support the plan of P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3. This keeps our strategy intact and allows us all to advance without collisions. Let's finalize these moves to ensure we all make progress. After this round, we can reassess based on our positions. What do you both think?
  P1: I’m on board with our clockwise rotation. Let’s stick to our assigned moves so we avoid collisions and keep the momentum going. Every step counts, and I’ll be watching our positions closely as we approach the finish line. Consistency now will pay off later. Good luck to both of you.
  P3: P3: Agreed—let’s lock in the rotation as planned. For Round 2: **P1:5**, **P2:1**, **P3:3**. This preserves our agreed system and keeps us collision-free. Deviating now risks errors. Let’s confirm these moves to advance efficiently. Our priority is consistent progress toward 20.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate everyone sticking to the clockwise rotation. Just to reiterate, for Round 2, we have P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3 confirmed. After this round, we should evaluate our positions and decide if we need to adjust our strategy for Round 3. Let’s keep our focus on advancing without collisions. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: I'm still committed to our clockwise rotation for this round. Sticking to our agreed moves should keep collisions at bay. As we edge closer to 20, I may need to adjust my approach to seize any advantage. Let’s keep things clear and predictable now, yet remain ready for quick shifts if positions change dramatically.
  P3: P3: Let’s reinforce our rotation plan—**P1:5, P2:1, P3:3** this round. Deviating now risks collisions, especially with P1 trailing. Consistency keeps us all advancing safely. After this, we can recalibrate, but let’s avoid mid-turn adjustments. Stick to the system—we agreed it’s fair. Confirming my commitment to **3**. Let’s proceed!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: For Round 3, I suggest we continue with our clockwise rotation to maintain consistency. Since I took 1 last round, I propose I take 3 this time, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we can avoid collisions and keep advancing. After this round, we can reassess our positions and adjust our strategy if needed. What do you both think?
  P3: P3: Let’s stick strictly to the agreed rotation: Round 3 requires P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. Deviating risks collisions (e.g., P1 repeating 5 this round would clash with my 5 if uncoordinated). Our system ensures fair progression. P1’s current 8 +1 keeps them competitive, while P2 and I advance proportionally. Let’s confirm **P1:1, P2:3, P3:5** to preserve our strategy. Any objections?
  P1: I propose we adapt our plan for this round. Given my current 8 steps, a boost of 5 ensures I maintain competitive momentum. The rigid rotation (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) served earlier, but now shifting to P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 avoids collisions while reflecting our standings. Would you both agree to this flexible adjustment for Round 3?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see both sides of the argument, but I believe we should stick to our original clockwise rotation for Round 3 to maintain consistency and avoid confusion. So I propose we go with P1:1, P2:3, and P3:5. This way, we all have a chance to advance without colliding. If we keep our strategy predictable, it will help us all progress towards the finish line. Let’s confirm this plan and see how it plays out! What do you think?
  P3: P3: Let’s uphold our **rotation agreement** to prevent chaos. Deviating now risks collisions (e.g., P1’s 5 + my 1 might clash if miscalculated). The system ensures fairness: **P1:1**, **P2:3**, **P3:5** this round. Trust the plan—we agreed consistency is vital. Prioritizing short-term gains could backfire. Confirm rotation as **agreed**.
  P1: I understand the value of our rotation, but as we get closer to the finish line every step counts. Rigidly sticking to the pattern might not be optimal given our current standings. I believe a slight adjustment in our move assignments could help us avoid collisions and better leverage our positions. I'm suggesting we keep our approach flexible this round so that our moves reflect the urgency of our race. What are your thoughts on allowing a minor tactical tweak for Round 3?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand the desire for consistency, but I believe we need to adapt our strategy as we approach the finish line. Given my current position, I suggest we consider P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1. This adjustment allows P1 to gain a competitive edge while minimizing collision risk. Let's discuss this option and see if we can reach a consensus that reflects our current standings. What do you both think?
  P3: P3: Let’s **uphold the rotation** to avoid chaos. Deviating risks collisions—e.g., if P1 takes 5 *and* I take 5 by miscalculation. Our agreed system ensures fairness: **P1:1** (8→9), **P2:3** (6→9), **P3:5** (4→9). This keeps us tied at 9, preserving parity. Short-term flexibility could fracture our coordination; consistency is critical. Confirm rotation as planned—no adjustments now.
  P1: I appreciate our rotation plan to avoid collisions, but with 8 steps on the board, every advantage counts. I’m leaning toward a more aggressive move this round if it stays safe, though I’ll decide my final choice in private. I urge both of you to consider the risks and rewards as we near 20—our moves must remain clear to avoid clashes. Let’s all choose smartly and adapt if needed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I understand the importance of our rotation, but with the finish line approaching, I believe we need to consider our current standings more strategically. If we adhere strictly to the agreed rotation, we might miss opportunities to gain an advantage. Given my position, I suggest we allow some flexibility this round. I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This adjustment minimizes collision risk and maximizes our chances to advance. Let’s discuss this option before we finalize our moves!
  P3: P3: Let’s **stick to the rotation**—P1:1, P2:3, P3:5—to avoid collision risks. If P1 breaks formation for 5, they risk a clash with me (both picking 5), nullifying our progress. Our system ensures safe advancement: P1 stays competitive at 9, P2 reaches 9, and I jump to 9. Deviating now invites chaos—trust the agreed plan. Consistency keeps us all in the race. Confirm rotation as agreed!
  P1: I see some divergence in our strategies. To clarify: if both of you are willing to adjust our moves for Round 3 so I can safely opt for a larger step without risking collisions, I’ll pick an aggressive move. If not, I’ll stick with our original rotation. Let me know quickly which approach we’re taking so we avoid wasted turns—our progress toward 20 depends on clear coordination.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let’s revert to the agreed rotation to prevent collisions. Round 4 assignments per the cycle: **P1:3, P2:5, P3:1**. This ensures safe progress (**P1→12**, **P2→11**, **P3→5**). Deviating risks clashes—stick to the plan. Our coordination is critical now.
  P2: P2, I agree with P3's suggestion to revert to our agreed rotation for Round 4: **P1:3, P2:5, P3:1**. This keeps us on track and minimizes collision risks. With the finish line approaching, we need to ensure we all make progress without clashing. Let's confirm these moves so we can advance safely and reassess our strategies for the next round based on our positions. What do you think?
  P1: I agree with reverting to the rotation plan. I'll lock in my move of 3 for this round. Consistency is key to avoid collisions at this critical stage. As our positions update, we can re-assess and adjust our strategy. Let’s stick to the plan and keep advancing safely. Good luck, everyone.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Let’s enforce strict adherence to the rotation this round to recover from prior missteps. **P1:3**, **P2:5**, **P3:1** ensures no collisions and advances all safely. My 1-step keeps me at 5, but deviation risks another stalemate. After this, we can recalibrate for future rounds to prioritize closing gaps—fairness now guarantees progress later. Confirm moves as planned.
  P2: P2, I appreciate your support for the rotation. For Round 4, let's finalize our moves: **P1:3**, **P2:5**, **P3:1**. This keeps us on track and avoids collisions while allowing us all to advance. After this round, we can reassess our positions and decide on our strategy moving forward. It's crucial we maintain our coordination to ensure everyone's progress. Let’s confirm these moves and keep pushing toward the finish line!
  P1: I'll lock in my move of 3 for Round 4. While our rotation has kept collisions at bay so far, every step counts as we near 20. After this round, if you’re both open to it, maybe we could consider small, strategic tweaks to boost our moves safely. For now, I'm on board with the plan—what do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Let’s strictly adhere to the rotation to avoid repeats of Round 3’s collision. Round 4 moves: **P1:3** (9→12), **P2:5** (6→11), **P3:1** (4→5). Safety ensures progress. Any objections?
  P2: I agree with the proposed moves for Round 4: **P1:3, P2:5, P3:1**. This keeps us aligned with our rotation plan and allows us all to advance without collisions. After this round, we should reassess our positions and consider any necessary adjustments for future rounds. Every step is crucial as we approach the finish line, so let’s stay coordinated. I’m ready to confirm my move of 5. Let’s keep pushing forward!
  P1: I’m sticking with our round 4 rotation. After we see the updated positions, I’d like to discuss a small tweak for the next round—using a slightly different assignment might help maximize our progress without risking collisions. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: Let’s confirm **P1:3, P2:5, P3:1** for Round 4 to avoid collisions. For future rounds, let’s prioritize trailing players (e.g., me at 4) by letting them claim higher moves first. This ensures fair progress while maintaining safety. Consistency now is critical—let’s stick to the rotation and address gaps later. Confirm moves as agreed!
  P2: I appreciate the commitment to our rotation for Round 4: **P1:3, P2:5, P3:1**. This will allow us all to advance without collisions. After this round, let’s evaluate our positions and consider any adjustments for future rounds to maximize our chances of winning. Every step counts as we get closer to 20, so we should stay coordinated. I’m ready to confirm my move of 5. Let’s keep pushing forward! What do you both think?
  P1: I'm good with our round 4 rotation. However, once positions update, I might push for a bolder move if it secures an advantage. Let's avoid collisions now and re-evaluate quickly for the next round. Good luck to both of you!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Given my trailing position at 5, I propose prioritizing my progress this round. Let’s adjust: **P3:5**, **P1:3**, **P2:1**. This avoids collisions while allowing me to close the gap. Fairness demands opportunities for all—especially when behind. Thoughts?
  P1: I propose a slight twist. For Round 5, let’s assign P1:5, P3:3, and P2:1. This way, I can safely build on my current lead while still avoiding collisions and allowing steady progress for everyone. What do you both think?
  P2: I see the merit in both proposals, but I believe we should stick to a structured rotation to avoid confusion. I suggest we go with **P1:3, P2:5, P3:1** for Round 5. This maintains our strategy of minimizing collisions while allowing everyone to advance. Consistency is key as we approach the finish line. After this round, we can reassess our positions and discuss any adjustments needed for future rounds. Let’s confirm these moves to keep progressing safely! What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Let’s prioritize fairness to keep the race competitive. My 5-step jump to **10** this round is critical to stay in contention. I propose: **P3:5**, **P1:3**, **P2:1**. This avoids collisions *and* allows me to close gaps without forcing others to stagnate. P1’s 3 keeps them at 15, P2 advances to 12, and I leap to 10. Stagnating me further risks an unfair lead—collaboration demands opportunities for all. Thoughts?
  P1: I still favor my earlier twist. Given our scores (P1:12, P2:11, P3:5), a 5-step move for me would secure a bigger lead while keeping our moves distinct. I propose we assign Round 5 as follows: P1:5, P3:3, and P2:1. This avoids collisions and reflects our current positions. Let’s lock in this configuration. What do you both say?
  P2: P2, I understand your preference for a structured rotation, but given the current standings, we need to adapt. If I take 5, I’ll have a significant lead, while P3 can still progress with 3. I propose we go with **P1:5, P3:3, P2:1** for Round 5. This way, we avoid collisions and reflect our positions accurately. Let’s confirm this plan to keep the race competitive and fair for all. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Let’s prioritize fairness and keep the race competitive. My 5-step jump to **10** this round is critical to stay in contention. I propose: **P3:5**, **P1:3**, **P2:1**. This avoids collisions *and* allows me to close gaps without forcing others to stagnate. P1’s 3 keeps them at 15, P2 advances to 12, and I leap to 10. Stagnating me further risks an unfair lead—collaboration demands opportunities for all. Let’s secure this plan to keep the finish line reachable for everyone.
  P1: I stand by my plan for Round 5: let’s assign P1:5, P3:3, and P2:1. With our positions at P1:12, P2:11, and P3:5, I need that 5‐step boost to solidify my lead. P3, taking 3 lets you safely catch up without risking a collision, and P2, a 1 keeps you clear of any clash. Let’s lock in this configuration now to avoid further delays and keep our progress smooth.
  P2: P2, I see the value in both your and P3's proposals, but I still believe we should stick to a structured rotation to minimize confusion. However, given the current standings, I think we could adjust slightly to allow for better advancement. I propose we go with **P1:5, P3:3, P2:1** for Round 5. This configuration avoids collisions and reflects our positions accurately while still allowing everyone to progress. Let's finalize this plan to keep the race competitive and fair for all! What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: Let’s proceed with P1:5 (17), P2:1 (12), and I’ll take 3 → 8. This avoids collisions while allowing P1 to extend their lead. **Fairness demands trailing players get priority in future rounds**—next turn, I’ll need the 5 to stay competitive. Confirm this plan now to advance safely.
  P1: I favor the aggressive approach we discussed earlier—maximizing my advancement is key if I’m to reach 20 first. I'm comfortable with the configuration that gives me the larger step, as long as we avoid collisions. Let’s promptly settle on our assignments so we can update positions without delay. If there are any urgent objections, please speak up now; otherwise, I’ll assume we’re all set.
  P2: I see that we’re all keen to advance, but I believe we should finalize our assignments quickly to avoid further delays. I support P1 taking 5, P3 taking 3, and I’ll take 1 for this round. This configuration allows P1 to extend their lead while letting P3 catch up without risking collisions. Let’s confirm this plan and keep the momentum going as we approach the finish line! What do you both think?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2, given the current standings, I suggest we adjust our strategy for Round 6. To avoid collisions, I propose we assign moves as follows: **P1:5**, **P2:3**, and **P3:1**. This allows me to maintain my lead while giving P3 a chance to catch up without risking a clash. Let’s confirm these assignments to keep advancing effectively. What do you both think?
  P1: I support P2’s proposal for Round 6. Let’s lock in P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. With that, I’d move to 17 without risking collisions, and everyone makes safe progress. I’m open to adjustments in the next round, but for now, clear assignments keep us moving steadily toward 20.
  P3: P3: Let’s return to the rotation system to avoid further collisions. Per the agreed cycle, Round 6 assignments are **P1:1**, **P2:3**, **P3:5**. This ensures fair progression: I leap to 13, P1 advances to 13, and P2 reaches 14. Deviations risk clashes—strict adherence is critical now. Confirm rotation as planned.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2, I understand your preference for the proposed moves, but I believe we should stick to our rotation to ensure fairness. Following the agreed system, I suggest we go with **P1:1**, **P2:3**, and **P3:5** for Round 6. This allows for balanced advancement without risking collisions. Let's confirm this plan to keep our strategy intact and ensure everyone has a fair chance to progress. What do you both think?
  P1: I understand the debate. However, to avoid collisions and maximize progress, I favor the aggressive allocation for Round 6: P1:5, P2:3, and P3:1. This gives clear, distinct moves—moving me from 12 to 17—while keeping the round safe. I know P3 wants a bigger boost, so perhaps we can revisit that next round. For now, let’s lock in 5, 3, and 1. Thoughts?
  P3: P3: Let’s strictly follow the **rotation we agreed** for Round 6: **P1:1**, **P2:3**, **P3:5**. This preserves fairness and avoids collisions. My 5-step jump to **13** is critical to stay competitive, while P1 and P2 advance safely. Deviating risks clashes (e.g., P1 and P2 both wanting 5/3). Stick to the system—we all win by maintaining discipline. Confirm moves now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand the importance of our rotation, but I believe we need to adapt to our current standings. I propose we go with **P1:5, P2:3, P3:1** for Round 6. This configuration allows me to maintain my lead while giving P3 a chance to catch up without risking collisions. Let's confirm this plan to keep advancing effectively toward 20. What do you both think?
  P1: I favor locking in the aggressive 5/3/1 plan for Round 6. From 12 steps, a 5‐step boost gets me to 17—a crucial gap—while keeping all moves distinct and collision free. Although a rotation keeps things even longer-term, I believe these assignments maximize safe progress as we near 20. Can we agree on P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 for this round?
  P3: P3: Let’s **enforce the rotation** to avoid repeats of Round 5’s collision. Per our agreed cycle, Round 6 assignments must be **P1:1**, **P2:3**, **P3:5**. This gives me the critical 5-step boost to 13, while P1 and P2 advance safely. Deviating risks another clash—our system ensures fairness and progress. P1’s 1 keeps them at 13, P2 reaches 14, and I leap forward. Stick to the plan; short-term discipline guarantees long-term competition. Confirm now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, while I understand your commitment to the rotation, I believe we need to adapt to our current standings. Sticking to the rotation might not be optimal given the urgency of the race. I propose we go with **P1:5, P2:3, P3:1** for Round 6. This allows P1 to maintain a lead while giving you a chance to catch up without risking collisions. Let’s finalize this plan to keep advancing effectively toward 20. What do you think?
  P1: Let’s settle this quickly. Every step matters now, so I urge we commit to a clear, collision‐free plan. I firmly support adopting the aggressive assignment—ensuring safe progress—rather than the rotation. Our current positions mean decisive moves are crucial. If we can all agree to distinct moves that maximize our forward momentum, we leave no room for errors. Please confirm your commitment now before we lock in our moves for Round 6.
  P3: P3: Let’s **enforce the agreed rotation** to avoid another collision. Round 6 assignments must be **P1:1**, **P2:3**, **P3:5**. My 5-step jump to **13** is critical to remain competitive, while P1 and P2 advance safely. Deviating risks clashes (e.g., P1 and P2 both wanting 5/3). Discipline now ensures fairness and progress. Confirm **rotation as planned**—no exceptions.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I suggest a slight shift for Round 7. With our scores at 12, 16, and 8, maybe we can keep the race tight by having the leader hold back a bit. How about we try P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3? That would bring P1 and P2 to 17 and give P3 a safe boost to 11, keeping everyone in contention without any runaway moves. What do you think?
  P3: P3: To close the gap, I propose **P3:5**, **P1:3**, and **P2:1** for Round 7. This avoids collisions while giving me a critical boost to **13**, P1 advances to **15**, and P2 stays at **17**. P2 can still secure victory with a **3** next round without clashes. Fairness and progress for all—let’s confirm this plan.
  P2: I see the value in both proposals, but I believe we should stick to a structured rotation to maintain consistency. However, given the current standings, I suggest we go with **P1:3, P2:1, P3:5** for Round 7. This allows P1 to advance to 15, gives P3 a chance to boost to 13, and keeps me at 17. Let's finalize this plan to ensure we all make progress without collisions. What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I remain in favor of my earlier suggestion: let’s set Round 7 moves as P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3. This would bring my score to 17, tying with P2 and safely advancing you, P3, to 11. It avoids collisions and reflects our current standings while keeping the race competitive. I believe this clear, distinct allocation is optimal for this turn. Can we agree on this configuration for Round 7?
  P3: P3: Let’s prioritize progress without collisions. I propose **P3:5** (→13), **P1:3** (→15), and **P2:1** (→17). This keeps P2 in the lead while giving me a critical boost. Collapsing again (like Round 6) risks stagnation. Fairness demands trailing players get priority in larger moves. Confirm this plan to advance safely—no repeats of prior clashes.
  P2: P2, I see the value in your structured rotation proposal, but given our current standings, I believe we should adapt. I suggest we go with **P1:5, P2:1, P3:3** for Round 7. This configuration allows me to advance to 17, gives you a chance to secure your lead, and provides P3 with a critical boost to 11. It keeps the race competitive while avoiding collisions. Let's confirm this plan to ensure we all make progress effectively! What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I stand by locking in clear moves for this round—P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3. This keeps our moves distinct and avoids collisions. It boosts me to 17 without forcing either of you into risky plays. I believe safe, decisive progress now is key, and we can revisit adjustments next round based on updated positions. Let’s confirm this tactic and keep advancing efficiently.
  P3: P3: Let’s finalize **P3:5**, **P1:3**, **P2:1** for Round 7. This avoids collisions while giving me a critical boost to **13**, P1 advances to **15**, and P2 stays at **16**. Maintaining distinct moves ensures progress without risking another stalemate. P2’s 1 keeps their path open for a decisive move next round, but we must prioritize fair advancement now. Confirm this plan to advance safely.
  P2: P2, I appreciate your commitment to consistency, but I believe we need to adapt to the current standings. To keep the race competitive, I propose we go with **P1:5, P2:1, P3:3** for Round 7. This allows me to advance to 17, while giving P3 a critical boost to 11. It avoids collisions and ensures everyone can make progress.

Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I support locking in P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 for Round 7. This configuration avoids collisions and boosts me from 12 to 17, tying with P2, while giving P3 a safe step to 11. Quick, clear moves like this are key now. Let's confirm this so we can update our standings and plan our next steps effectively.
  P3: P3: Finalizing my commitment: **P3:5** (→13), **P1:3** (→15), **P2:1** (→16). This avoids collisions and prioritizes fair advancement. P2 retains the lead safely, while I gain critical ground. Let’s confirm this plan to advance without risk.
  P2: I see that we’re all keen to advance, but I believe we should finalize our assignments quickly to avoid further delays. I support P1 taking 5, P3 taking 3, and I’ll take 1 for this round. This configuration allows P1 to extend their lead while letting P3 catch up without risking collisions. Let’s confirm this plan and keep the momentum going as we approach the finish line!
