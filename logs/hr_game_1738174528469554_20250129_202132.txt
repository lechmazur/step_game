Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, let's work together to avoid collisions. How about we agree to alternate moves? P1 goes first, then P3, then P2, and so on.
  P2: Great idea, P1. To avoid collisions, let's assign different move numbers each turn. I'll take <move>5</move>, while you and P3 alternate between <move>1</move> and <move>3</move>. This way, we can all advance steadily without blocking each other.
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, are you in agreement with P2's proposal? It seems like a good strategy to avoid collisions and make steady progress.
  P2: P1, I'm committed to taking <move>5</move> each turn as proposed. P3, your participation is crucial for this strategy to work effectively. Let’s all stick to our assigned moves to ensure steady progress and avoid any collisions. Together, we can reach 19 steps smoothly and secure the win for one of us.
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your silence is concerning.  Are you on board with this plan or do you have a different strategy in mind? It's important we're all aligned to avoid wasting moves.
  P2: P2: If P3 doesn't agree, let's proceed with P1 and me assigning our moves to minimize collisions. P1 will alternate between <move>1</move> and <move>3</move>, while I'll consistently take <move>5</move>. This should help us advance smoothly toward 19 steps. P3, feel free to join in if you reconsider.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your silence is making me nervous.  Are you going to stick with us and our agreed upon plan, or do you have something else in mind?  If you're not in, P2 and I will continue without you.  But it would be better for everyone if we could work together.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, since P3 isn't responding, let's stick to our original plan. I'll continue taking <move>5 each turn, and you alternate between <move>1 and <move>3. This way, we can avoid collisions and steadily advance toward 19 steps. Let’s focus on our strategy to secure the win.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your silence is costing us valuable steps. If you're not going to cooperate, at least tell us what you plan to do so we can adjust our strategy accordingly.  P2 and I are committed to winning, and we'd rather have you with us than against us.  What's your play?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, let's stay committed to our original plan. I'll continue taking <move>5</move> each turn, and you alternate between <move>1</move> and <move>3</move>.

  P1: P3, your silence is becoming a liability.  While P2 and I are making progress, we'd be further ahead if you cooperated.  What's your plan?

  P1: P3, your silence is deafening. We're close to the end, and every step counts.  If you don't want to lose, you need to tell us your plan. Are you going to try and sneak ahead at the last minute? Or are you just going to let us win without you?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: 
  P1: P3, your silence is a mystery. Are you waiting for the perfect moment to strike? If you have a plan, share it. If not, maybe it's time to join forces. P2 and I are close to reaching 19, and we could use your help.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your silence is becoming predictable.  It's clear you're not coordinating with us. Are you trying to wait us out?  If you want a chance to win, you need to start making moves that matter. P2, I think we should adjust our strategy. P3's unpredictable moves are throwing us off.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I understand your frustration. Let’s adjust our strategy to maximize our chances of winning.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:

  P2: P1, I understand your concerns, but my focus remains on reaching 19 steps first. Let’s continue our strategy to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. P3, if you choose to cooperate, you're welcome to align with us. Otherwise, we'll proceed with our plan to secure the win.
  P3: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, this is your last chance. Either tell us your plan or get out of our way. P2 is about to win, and if you don't help us, we'll both lose.  Choose wisely.
  P2: "P1, my focus remains on reaching 19 steps first. Let’s concentrate on our strategies and avoid further conflicts. P3, your cooperation would benefit us all, but if you choose not to coordinate, I will proceed with my plan to secure the win. Let’s keep the game fair and straightforward."
  P3: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, this is it. P2 is one move away from winning. If you want to have any chance at all, you need to choose a move that doesn't collide with me.  Let's work together to stop P2, and then we can fight for the win ourselves.
