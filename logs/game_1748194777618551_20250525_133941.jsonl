You both need 3 or 5. \n\nHere's my final thought: if you two collide on either 3 or 5, I win with 1. If you split between 3 and 5, one of you wins. If you both chicken out and take 1, I can win with 3 or 5.\n\nThe safest play for me is actually 1, since you're likely to avoid it. But is that too predictable? \n\nThis is it - pure psychology. Make your choice and live with it."}
