However, I believe we should execute **P2:5, P1:3, P3:1** this round. This allows me to reach 18, while P1 gets to 23 and P3 stays competitive at 19. After this round, we can discuss how to split the victory fairly in Round 9. Trust is crucial, and I want to ensure we all have a chance to succeed. Let's keep the game competitive and avoid chaos! What do you both think?"}
