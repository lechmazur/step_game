Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 (me) takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we all move forward without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P1: I'm not sure I want to agree to that arrangement. It gives P3 the biggest advantage right away. Why should I settle for just 1 step? I think we should rotate who gets which number each round to keep things fair. Maybe I take 5 this round, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3? That way we all get different advantages over time.
  P3: I think P1’s idea of rotating the moves each round is fair. If we stick to a rotation, no one gets an unfair advantage over time. For this round, I’m fine with taking <move>3</move> if it helps avoid collisions. Let’s agree on an order and stick to it going forward. Suggest we rotate in the order P1 → P2 → P3 for who gets 5, 3, and 1 each round. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Alright, let's go with the rotation idea. P1 takes <move>5</move>, I (P2) will take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move> this round. We can rotate next round. This way, we all get a fair shot at different moves. Let's agree on this and move forward.
  P1: I'm fine with the rotation plan. I'll take <move>5</move> this round, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. Next round, we'll rotate so I take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps things fair over time. Let's stick to this rotation throughout the game to avoid collisions and give everyone equal opportunity.
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan we've discussed. It ensures fairness and minimizes collisions. Let's stick to it strictly: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move> this round. For the next round, we rotate as agreed. Consistency is key to avoiding conflicts and ensuring everyone gets a fair chance. If anyone deviates, it’ll only cause chaos and make it harder for all of us to progress. Let’s confirm and move forward.
