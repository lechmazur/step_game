Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let's try to avoid collisions right from the start. I suggest we each pick a different number this round to ensure we all advance. I’m leaning towards one of the options, but I’m open to coordination. How about we discuss who takes 1, 3, or 5? Let me know your preferences, and we can set a fair split for this turn.
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to avoid collisions. I'll take 3 this round if that works for everyone. P1, you mentioned leaning towards one of the options; if you're okay with 1, that leaves 5 for P2. Let's confirm this setup to ensure we all advance.
