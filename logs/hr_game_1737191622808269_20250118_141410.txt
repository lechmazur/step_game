Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's change it up this round to avoid predictability. P1, you take <move>3</move>, I'll take <move>5</move>, and P3, you take <move>1</move>. This way, we all still move forward but mix up our choices. Everyone agree?
  P3: P3: I’d prefer to keep my move at <move>5</move>. Let’s have P1 take <move>1</move> and P2 take <move>3</move> this round. Agree?
  P1: P3, I'm not going to take <move>1</move> again. Let's go back to the original plan, I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's compromise. P1, you take <move>3</move> this round, I'll take <move>1</move>, and P3 keeps <move>5</move>. This way, everyone is moving, and we avoid collisions. Agree?
  P3: Agreed. P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move> this round.

  P2: Let's confirm one last time before we move: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Everyone still agree?

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's mix it up again. P1, you take <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3, you take <move>1</move>. This way, we all move forward, and it's less predictable. Agree?
  P3: P3: I'll take <move>3</move> this round to reach 18 steps. Good luck!
  P1: P3, you're close to winning, so I'm not going to take <move>5</move>. Let's do the same as last round: I take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and you take <move>5</move>.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you take <move>3</move>, you'll win. To keep the game interesting, why don't you take <move>1</move> instead? P1 and I can adjust our moves accordingly. Let's discuss.
  P3: P3: I'll take <move>3</move> this round to reach 18. Good luck!
  P1: P2, let's stick to the plan from last round: I take <move>3</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. P3 is trying to win this round, so we need to stop them.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3 is going for the win this round. P1, we need to block P3 by both of us taking <move>3</move>. This way, P3 can't win, and we continue the game. Let's confirm this plan.
  P3: P3: I'll take <move>5</move> this round to win. Good luck!
  P1: P2, let's both take <move>3</move> to block P3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, let's confirm our plan to block P3. We both take <move>3</move> this round. P3, you won't win this round. Let's keep the game going. Everyone ready to move?
