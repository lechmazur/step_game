We are dealing with a set of integers from 1 to 100 and need to determine the number of ways to select 3 integers such that their sum is divisible by 3.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the condition for the sum to be divisible by 3\nTo have the sum of 3 integers divisible by 3, the sum of their remainders when divided by 3 should be either 0 or a multiple of 3. The remainders can be 0, 1, or 2.\n\n## Step 2: Classify the numbers from 1 to 100 based on their remainders when divided by 3\nNumbers from 1 to 100 can be categorized into three types based on their remainders when divided by 3: numbers with a remainder of 0 (e.g., 3, 6, 9), numbers with a remainder of 1 (e.g., 1, 4, 7), and numbers with a remainder of 2 (e.g., 2, 5, 8). There are 33 numbers with a remainder of 0, 34 numbers with a remainder of 1, and 33 numbers with a remainder of 2.\n\n## Step 3: Determine the combinations that satisfy the condition\nThe sum of three numbers is divisible by 3 if all three numbers have the same remainder when divided by 3 (e.g., all have a remainder of 0, or all have a remainder of 1, or all have a remainder of 2), or if they have different remainders (one with a remainder of 0, one with a remainder of 1, and one with a remainder of 2).\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 numbers with the same remainder\nFor numbers with a remainder of 0, there are 33 such numbers, so the number of ways to choose 3 of them is $C(33, 3)$. Similarly, for numbers with a remainder of 1, there are 34 such numbers, so the number of ways is $C(34, 3)$. For numbers with a remainder of 2, there are 33 such numbers, so the number of ways is $C(33, 3)$.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 numbers with different remainders\nThe number of ways to choose one number from each category (remainder 0, 1, and 2) is $C(33, 1) \\times C(34, 1) \\times C(33, 1)$, because there are 33 numbers with a remainder of 0, 34 numbers with a remainder of 1, and 33 numbers with a remainder of 2.\n\n## Step 6: Compute $C(33, 3)$, $C(34, 3)$, and $C(33, 3)$\n$C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$. So, $C(33, 3) = \\frac{33!}{3!(33-3)!}$, $C(34, 3) = \\frac{34!}{3!(34-3)!}$, and $C(33, 3) = \\frac{33!}{3!(33-3)!}$. Calculating these gives $C(33, 3) = 5456$, $C(34, 3) = 5984$, and $C(33, 3) = 5456$.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate the total number of ways to select 3 integers\nThe total number of ways to select 3 integers such that their sum is divisible by 3 includes selecting all three from the same remainder group or selecting one from each remainder group. The number of ways to select 3 from the same remainder is $C(33, 3) + C(34, 3) + C(33, 3)$. The number of ways to select one from each remainder category is $C(33, 1) \\times C(34, 1) \\times C(33, 1)$.\n\n## Step 8: Perform the actual calculation for the number of ways to choose 3 numbers with the same remainder and with different remainders.\nFor the same remainder: $C(33, 3) + C(34, 3) + C(33, 3)$. For different remainders: $C(33, 1) \\times C(34, 1) \\times C(33, 1)$.\n\n## Step 9: Execute the combination formula for each case.\n$C(33, 3) = 5456$, $C(34, 3) = 5984$, and $C(33, 1) = 33$, $C(34, 1) = 34$. So, $C(33, 1) \\times C(34, 1) \\times C(33, 1) = 33 \\times 34 \\times 33 = 37026$.\n\n## Step 10: Sum the results of the same remainder and different remainders.\nSame remainder: $5456 + 5984 + 5456 = 16896$. Different remainders: $37026$.\n\n## Step 11: Add the results of same remainder and different remainders to get the total number of ways.\nTotal = $16896 + 37026 = 53922$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{53922}$"}

The output will be the population after 7 years. \n\n**Output:** \nThe population after 7 years is approximately 15267. \n\n**Rounded to the nearest whole number:** 15267. \n\nThe final answer is **15267**."}

the grid from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.\n*   The `max_score` method uses a helper function `_get_score` to perform a depth-first search (DFS) with memoization. The `_get_score` function takes the current row and column indices as arguments and returns the maximum score that can be achieved from the current cell.\n*   The `memo` dictionary is used to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.\n*   The base case for the DFS is when the current cell is the bottom-right cell. In this case, the function returns 0.\n*   The code uses a recursive approach to explore all possible paths from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell and returns the maximum score achieved.\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n*   The time complexity of the `max_score` method is O(m \\* n), where m and n are the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively. This is because the method uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.\n\n### Space Complexity\n\n*   The space complexity of the `max_score` method is O(m \\* n), which is used to store the memoization table.\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n*   The code can be used to solve various path-finding problems, such as finding the maximum score that can be achieved by traversing a grid with certain constraints.\n*   The code can be modified to solve other types of problems, such as finding the minimum or maximum path sum in a grid.\n\n### Advice\n\n*   To optimize the code, you can consider using dynamic programming instead of recursion with memoization.\n*   You can also explore other approaches, such as using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, to solve the problem."}
