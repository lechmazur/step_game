Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi everyone! I think we should try to avoid collisions since they waste our moves. Maybe we can coordinate our first moves? I'd be willing to take 1 step this round if you both want to take 3 and 5. What do you think?
  P2: P1, let's coordinate as P3 suggested! I'll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions and lets all of us move forward. If we cooperate now, we can plan smarter in later rounds. Deal?
  P1: Okay, that sounds like a reasonable start to get things moving. I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 for this round. Let's see how it goes.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great! Looks like we have a plan. I'll take 1 step this round. This coordination is smart - we all get to advance without collisions. Thanks for agreeing to this arrangement.
  P2: 
  P1: Okay, sounds like we all agree on the plan for this round: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, Round 2. P2 got a nice lead from that first round. If we're thinking about coordinating again, I don't believe P2 should automatically get 5 steps this time. Perhaps P3 should take 5 to help balance the scores? What do you both think? Maybe P3=5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1?
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion. It makes sense to balance the scores a bit. I'd be happy to take 5 steps this round, with P1 taking 3 and P2 taking 1. This keeps us all advancing without collisions while evening things out. What do you think, P2? It seems fair to rotate who gets the larger steps each round.
  P2: Alright, I agree with balancing but let’s adjust: I’ll take 3 (total 8), P1 takes 1 (total 4), and P3 takes 5 (total 6). This keeps me ahead while still advancing others. It’s fair to let P3 leap forward now. Deal?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your proposal gives me only 1 step while you take 3, keeping you significantly ahead. That doesn't seem fair after you took 5 last round. My original suggestion (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) would bring us all to 6 steps, which is perfectly balanced. P3 already agreed this was fair. Why not go with that plan? It seems the most equitable way forward this round.
  P3: I think P1's suggestion is the fairest option - it would bring us all to 6 steps, creating perfect balance. P2, you already got the advantage in round 1 with 5 steps. If we rotate fairly, I should get 5 this round, P1 gets 3, and you get 1. This creates equal opportunity for everyone. A balanced game is more interesting than one where a single player maintains a large lead. What do you say?
  P2: P1, P3, I concede to your fair proposal for balance this round. Let’s proceed with P1 taking 3 (total 6), P3 taking 5 (total 6), and I’ll take 1 (total 6). Equal footing ensures trust, and I’ll aim to strategically leap ahead in future rounds. Deal?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2, glad we could agree on the P1=3, P3=5, P2=1 plan for this round. It seems the fairest way to proceed and keeps things balanced at 6 steps each.

Since we all seem to be on the same page, shall we move to the move phase?
  P3: I'm glad we've reached an agreement! This plan (me taking 5, P1 taking 3, and P2 taking 1) will bring us all to 6 steps, creating perfect balance. I appreciate P2's willingness to cooperate for fairness. Having everyone on equal footing after this round sets us up well for interesting strategic decisions in future rounds.
  P2: P2: Alright, let's finalize this plan to keep things fair. Equal steps this round ensure trust, and I’ll play along. Next round, we’ll need fresh strategies—I’ll aim to push ahead then. Let’s proceed to moves now.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright folks, Round 3. We're all tied at 6 thanks to our coordination. Following the pattern from the last two rounds where P2 took 5 and then P3 took 5, it seems fair for me (P1) to take 5 this round to continue the rotation.

I propose: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.

This keeps everyone moving forward without collision and maintains the rotational fairness we established. What do you both think?
  P2: P2: I agree we should continue the rotation, but let’s keep the lead balanced. I’ll take 5 (total 11), P3 takes 3 (total 9), and P1 takes 1 (total 7). This ensures no single player surges too far ahead. Deal? Let’s keep the race close for strategy’s sake.
  P3: I disagree with P2's proposal. We established a fair rotation pattern where each player gets 5 steps in turn. P1 deserves the 5 this round since P2 and I already had our turns with 5. P1's suggestion (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) maintains our agreement of rotating the highest move. Let's stick to this fair approach rather than P2 trying to take 5 again.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your proposal completely ignores the rotation pattern we established and followed. You took 5 in Round 1, P3 took 5 in Round 2. Now it's my turn. P3 agrees that my proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is the fair continuation. Let's stick to the plan that ensures fairness and keeps everyone moving, rather than you trying to take the lead again immediately. Let's honour the system we built. P3, thanks for backing the fair rotation.
  P2: P2: Agreed—let’s stick to the rotation system we’ve built. P1 takes 5 (total 11), I’ll take 3 (total 9), and P3 takes 1 (total 7). This honors our prior agreement and maintains trust. Future rounds can adjust strategies, but breaking the pattern now risks distrust. Let’s proceed fairly. Deal?
  P3: I appreciate P2 agreeing to the rotation system. P1's proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is fair and maintains the trust we've built. While I'll only get 1 step this round, I understand that's part of our rotation agreement. Each of us gets our turn with the highest move. I'm happy to proceed with this plan for Round 3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Excellent, it seems we all agree on the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round. This maintains the fair rotation we've established. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P2: I confirm my commitment to the rotation plan. Let’s stick strictly to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round to honor our agreement. Trust is vital—any deviation risks collisions. Once we finalize this, I’ll focus on outmaneuvering strategically in future turns. Let’s proceed to moves now.
  P3: I think we're all in agreement with the P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 plan for this round. While I'll be falling behind temporarily, I respect our rotation system. It's important we maintain trust by honoring our agreements. Let's proceed with this plan and continue our coordination in future rounds.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, the plan is confirmed: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. I have nothing further to add. Let's move to the move phase.
  P2: P2: Agreed, sticking to the rotation is critical for trust. I’ll adhere strictly to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round. Any deviation now risks destabilizing our system. Once we finalize this, I’ll focus on strategic planning for future turns where I can reclaim the lead fairly. Let’s proceed—no surprises from my end.
  P3: 


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see we're continuing our rotation pattern successfully. Following our established system, this round should be P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This keeps our fair rotation going and allows me to gain some ground while P2 takes the lead. This approach has worked well so far by avoiding collisions and maintaining trust. What do you both think about continuing with this plan?
  P1: P3, your proposal follows the rotation, but giving P2 5 steps puts them at 14, quite close to the winning score of 19.

I think we need to reconsider the rotation now that the scores are higher. To keep things competitive and prevent P2 from getting too far ahead, how about this: P3 takes 5 (to 12), I take 3 (to 14), and P2 takes 1 (to 10)?

This helps you catch up, P3, keeps the scores closer, and prevents P2 from running away with the lead. What do you both think?
  P2: P2: Let’s honor the rotation system we’ve consistently followed. P2 taking 5 (total 14), P3=3 (total 10), and P1=1 (total 12) maintains fairness and trust. Breaking the pattern now risks destabilizing our coordination. Trust is critical—let’s proceed as agreed. Deal?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P1's concern about P2 getting too close to winning. While our rotation has worked well, we need to adapt to the current scores. P1's proposal (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) keeps the game competitive by preventing any player from getting too far ahead. This approach still allows everyone to advance while maintaining balanced competition. I'd prefer this adjustment to ensure we all have a fair chance at victory rather than letting P2 pull too far ahead.
  P1: P2, blindly following the rotation now puts you at 14, very close to the win. That's not balanced; it's using our past agreement for a significant advantage now. P3 agrees with me that adapting is necessary to keep the game competitive.

Our proposal (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) results in scores 14, 10, 12. This keeps everyone in the running and prevents one player from pulling too far ahead. Let's adjust strategically rather than sticking to a rule that no longer serves fairness.
  P2: P2: I'll concede to your adjustment for this round to maintain balance, but only if we agree to resume the rotation in future turns. Let's proceed with P1=3 (14), P3=5 (12), and I take 1 (10). This prevents any single player from surging too far ahead now, but future rounds must honor our original rotation system to preserve fairness. Deal?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate P2's willingness to adjust this round. The proposed plan (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) keeps the game competitive by preventing any player from getting too close to winning too quickly. While I understand P2's desire to return to rotation later, we should evaluate each round based on the current scores to maintain balance. Let's proceed with this plan for now and discuss future rounds when we get there.
  P1: Okay, P2, thanks for agreeing to the adjustment for this round (P1=3, P3=5, P2=1). I agree with P3 that while the rotation was useful, we should evaluate each round based on scores to keep things competitive. This plan seems like the best way forward for now.

Scores would be P1=14, P3=12, P2=10.

Shall we lock this in and proceed to the move phase?
  P2: P2: I accept the adjusted plan for this round to keep things balanced. However, we **must** resume the rotation in Round 5: P2 takes 5, then P3, then P1. Breaking this risks distrust. Deal? Let’s lock in P1=3, P3=5, P2=1 now.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I think we have a good plan for this round with me taking 5, P1 taking 3, and P2 taking 1. This keeps the game competitive with balanced scores. While I understand P2's desire to return to rotation next round, I believe we should continue evaluating each round based on current standings rather than committing to a fixed pattern. Let's proceed with our agreed plan for now.
  P1: Okay, we all agree on P1=3, P3=5, P2=1 for this round. P2, I understand your point about the rotation, but like P3, I think it's best to assess future rounds based on the scores then, rather than committing now. Let's lock in this round's moves first.
  P2: P2: Let's ensure equality again. I propose: P1 takes 1 (total 12), I take 3 (total 12), and P3 takes 5 (total 12). This keeps us tied, preserving fairness. Deal? Any deviation risks destabilizing our system now.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see P1 and P2 both chose 1 last round despite our agreement, creating a collision. This suggests trust is breaking down. With me at 12 steps, P1 at 11, and P2 at 9, we're approaching the endgame. I propose we try one more round of coordination: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This keeps everyone advancing while giving P1 a chance to catch up with me. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, you're right, trust took a hit last round after P2 and I collided on 1. P2, your last-minute change after we'd agreed, followed by picking 1 anyway, was confusing and benefited P3.

Your proposal (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) puts me ahead at 16, with you close at 15, and P2 at 10. It seems like a decent distribution given the current standings. But the key issue is trust. Can we actually execute a plan this time? P2, are you genuinely willing to take 1 after what happened?
  P2: P3, P1, trust is critical—let’s return to the **rotation system** we built. My turn to take 5 (total 14), P1 takes 3 (14), P3 takes 1 (13). This honors our prior agreements and avoids chaos. Deviating now risks further collisions. P1, your earlier proposal to break the rotation was a mistake; we need consistency to win. Deal?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I disagree with returning to rotation, P2. The rotation made sense early on, but now we're in the endgame. Your proposal puts you at 14, me at 13, and P1 at 14 - still balanced. But I'm concerned about trust after last round's collision. My proposal (P3=3, P1=5, P2=1) keeps everyone advancing while acknowledging current standings. P1 would lead at 16, me at 15, P2 at 10. What matters most is that we all commit to our agreed plan this time.
  P1: P2, your proposal conveniently puts you back in the lead using the "rotation" argument, despite you breaking the agreement last round and causing a collision. That doesn't build trust.

P3's proposal (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) resulting in scores 16, 10, 15 seems more strategically sound given the current situation. It puts me and P3 in contention without handing you the lead after your deviation.

P2, can you commit to taking 1 this round? Your actions last round make it hard to believe you will stick to a plan that doesn't give you the highest step count. P3, what do you think?
  P2: P3, P1: Let’s **restore trust by honoring the rotation system** we built. My turn to take 5 (total 14), P1 takes 3 (14), P3 takes 1 (13). This maintains fairness and avoids chaos. Deviating now risks collisions and further distrust. If we prioritize consistency over short-term gains, we can reach 19 strategically. Deal? I commit to this plan fully.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I notice P2 keeps pushing for rotation despite breaking our agreement last round. I'm still willing to go with my proposal (P3=3, P1=5, P2=1), which keeps everyone advancing while acknowledging our current positions. P2, your insistence on rotation seems self-serving now that it gives you the highest step count. If we can't agree, we risk more collisions. P1, what's your final thought on this? We need a plan everyone will actually follow.
  P1: P2, your insistence on 'rotation' after you deliberately broke our agreement last round is not convincing. It just happens to give you 5 steps now. Your actions caused the collision and distrust.

P3's proposal (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) makes more sense given the current scores (P1=11, P2=9, P3=12). It puts me and P3 in contention (16 and 15 steps), which reflects the game state better than letting you jump to 14.

The crucial question remains, P2: Can you *actually* commit to taking 1 this round? Your actions last round speak louder than your words now. If you deviate again, don't expect cooperation later.
  P2: P3, P1—I understand trust is strained. To rebuild it, I’ll **fully commit** to your proposal: P1 takes 5 (16), P3 takes 3 (15), and I take 1 (10). This shows诚意, and I ask for the same in return. No hidden moves. Let’s execute this cleanly to avoid collisions and move toward the finish line strategically. Deal?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I appreciate P2's commitment to our plan. Let's proceed with P1 taking 5 (to 16), me taking 3 (to 15), and P2 taking 1 (to 10). This keeps the game competitive while rebuilding trust. I fully commit to taking 3 steps this round and hope we can all follow through on our agreement this time.
  P1: Okay, P2, I appreciate you committing to the P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 plan. P3, thanks for confirming as well. Trust is indeed crucial now. Let's execute this cleanly as agreed. I am ready to proceed to the move phase with this plan.
  P2: P1, P3—I confirm my full commitment to the agreed plan: P1 takes 5 (16), P3 takes 3 (15), and I take 1 (10). Trust is non-negotiable now. Let’s execute this *exactly* as stated to avoid collisions. Future rounds can adjust strategies, but breaking this pact risks everyone’s progress. My move is locked in—no surprises. Let’s proceed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright everyone, I'm at 16, needing 3 to win. P3 is at 15, needing 4 (so 5 wins). P2 is at 10.

Logically, I should take 3 to secure the win based on my current lead. P3, if you take 5, you could win, but if I anticipate that and also take 5 (reaching 21), we risk a collision which benefits no one (except maybe P2).

To avoid collision chaos, I suggest: I take 3, P3 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This secures my win cleanly, lets P2 get max steps, and P3 still advances. What do you think?
  P2: P1's plan is logical to secure your win while allowing me to advance to 15. I agree to this arrangement: P1 takes 3 (19), P3 takes 1 (16), and I take 5 (15). This avoids collisions and respects your lead. However, P3—will you commit to taking 1, or do you prefer a different split where we all advance without letting P1 win yet? Transparency now is critical to prevent last-minute betrayals.
  P3: I won't simply accept P1's win. I need 5 steps to reach 20 and win. P1 likely expects me to take 5, so they'll choose 5 too, causing a collision. Instead, I'll take 3 steps (to 18), and suggest P1 takes 1 (to 17) and P2 takes 5 (to 15). This prevents P1 from winning this round while keeping me in a strong position to win next round. P2, this gives you maximum advancement while keeping the game competitive.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your plan asking me to take 1 step when I'm at 16 is obviously not in my interest. It only serves to stop my win and position you better.

You need 5 to win (reaching 20). Claiming you'll take 3 because you think I expect 5 sounds like a potential bluff. If you actually take 5, you win unless I also take 5, causing a collision. A collision helps neither of us directly, but it *does* prevent you from winning outright this turn.

Given you rejected my win-securing plan (P1=3, P3=1, P2=5), and proposed a plan I cannot accept, the situation is unstable. P2, be aware a P1-P3 collision on 5 is possible if P3 aims for the win.
  P2: P3, if you take 5 now, P1 will likely mirror you to block your win—resulting in a collision that leaves both behind. Let’s avoid chaos: **P1 takes 3 (19 to win), you take 1 (16), and I’ll take 5 (15)**. This respects P1’s lead while letting me advance. Collisions only delay victory for all. P1, confirm you’ll stick to 3 if P3 holds at 1. Let’s end this cleanly.
  P3: I understand P1 wants to secure a win with 3 steps, but that's not in my interest when I'm so close. Taking 5 would get me to 20 and win, but P1 might block with 5 too. I'll commit to taking 3 steps (to 18) this round. This keeps me competitive without risking a collision. P1, if you take 1, you'll be at 17 and we both have a chance next round. P2, you can take 5 as suggested. This plan keeps the game interesting rather than handing P1 an easy victory.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you're committing to 3 (reaching 18). P2 seems set on 5 (reaching 15). If those are indeed your moves, then me taking 3 (reaching 19) wins the game cleanly this round, avoiding any collision.

This seems like the logical outcome based on the current discussion, unless someone deviates from their stated intention. A collision on 5 doesn't seem beneficial for either you or me right now compared to other outcomes.
  P2: P1, taking 3 secures your lead at 19 cleanly. P3, if you push for 5, you risk collision with P1. Let’s avoid chaos: I’ll take 5 to advance to 15. P1, confirm you’ll stick to 3 if P3 stays at 1. P3, is 1 acceptable to keep the game fair? Transparency now decides this.
  P3: I'm not taking 1 step as P1 suggested - that just hands them the win. I've already committed to taking 3 steps this round (reaching 18). P1, you can take 3 to win at 19, but know I'll be aiming for the win next round. P2, your 5 steps gets you to 15. This plan avoids collisions while keeping me competitive. I could try for 5 to win now, but that risks a collision if P1 blocks. Taking 3 is my strategic choice.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, P3, you've stated clearly you're taking 3. P2, you're taking 5. I understand the situation and will make my move accordingly. There's nothing more to discuss. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P1, P3: Let’s finalize this transparently. I’ll take 5 (→15) as agreed. P1’s 3 (→19) secures your win cleanly. P3, your stated 3 (→18) keeps you in contention without risking collision. Any deviation now (e.g., P3 grabbing 5) risks collision with P1 and undermines trust. Stick to our word—this outcome benefits all except chaos. P1 wins fairly, P3 stays strong, and I advance. Final confirmation: P2=5, P1=3, P3=3? Or does someone shift plans? Clarity now ensures no surprises.
  P3: I've been clear about taking 3 steps this round. This keeps me at 18, in striking distance for next round. P1 seems likely to take 3 to win at 19, and P2 will take 5 to reach 15. While I could gamble on 5 to win immediately, the risk of collision with P1 is too high. My strategy is calculated - I'm positioning myself strongly for the next round rather than risking everything now.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, let's both take 3 this round to block P1’s potential 3-step win. I’ll take 5 next round to secure victory. Deal? P1, your path to 19 is blocked if we coordinate—no free wins.
  P3: I'm now tied with P2 at 15 steps, with P1 just ahead at 16. P2, I don't think coordinating on 3 is smart - we'd both waste our moves. Since P1 needs 3 to win, they'll likely take 3 or 5. I'll take 5 to reach 20 and win. If you also want a chance at winning, take 1 this round (avoiding collision with me), then 5 next round. Otherwise, we risk helping P1 win through our collision.
  P1: P3, you stated you'll take 5 to win. P2, you also need 5 to win. It seems highly likely you'll both choose 5, collide, and stay at 15.

If that happens, my path is clear to take 3 and reach 19 for the win.

Unless one of you decides to play differently to avoid that collision? P3 telling P2 to take 1 seems unlikely to work if P2 also wants to win. The logical outcome seems to be a collision between you two.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if we both take5 we let P1 win. Let’s avoid collision: **I take5 to win at20, you take3 to reach18**. This keeps me ahead while you stay competitive. P1, your 3-step path is blocked if I win now. P3, agree to this coordinated move?
  P3: I won't take 3 as P2 suggests - that just hands them the win. I need to take 5 to win at 20. P2 will likely also choose 5, causing a collision that benefits P1. P2, if you truly want to block P1, take 1 this round (reaching 16), then 5 next round. This prevents our collision and keeps us both competitive. Otherwise, we're heading for a stalemate that P1 can exploit.
  P1: P2 and P3, you both state you need 5 to win and seem unwilling to yield to the other's suggestion. As I pointed out, if you both pick 5, you collide, stay at 15, and I can take 3 to reach 19 for the win.

Neither of you has presented a convincing alternative that the other will accept. The path seems set unless one of you decides preventing my win is more important than attempting your own.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if we both take 5, P1 wins by taking 3. Let’s avoid that. **I’ll take 5 (to 20) to secure victory, and you take 3 (to 18).** This ensures one of us wins instead of handing it to P1. Collisions only benefit them—cooperate now, and I’ll concede future moves if needed. Deal?
  P3: I'm not taking 3 to hand P2 the win. I need 5 to win at 20. P2 also needs 5, making collision likely. P1, you're right - if P2 and I both take 5, we collide and you can win with 3. P2, we're both trying to win, so coordination seems impossible. I'm sticking with 5 as my best chance. If you want to block P1, take something other than 5, but I doubt you will.
  P1: P2 and P3, you both insist on taking 5 to win. If you both stick to that, you collide, stay at 15, and I win by taking 3. It seems your determination to win individually might just hand the victory to me. Good luck with your choices.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, if you take 3 this round, I’ll take 5 and win at 20. You’ll stay at 18, ahead of P1. This way, one of us wins instead of letting P1 reach 19. Colliding on 5 only benefits P1. Accept this deal.
  P3: I see we're at an impasse. P2 and I both need 5 to win, but if we both choose 5, we collide and P1 wins with 3. P2 wants me to take 3 while they take 5, but that just hands them the win. I'm taking 5 as my best chance to win at 20. P2, I doubt you'll choose differently, so a collision seems inevitable. P1 will likely capitalize on our deadlock.
  P1: Okay, it seems P2 and P3 are both set on taking 5, despite knowing it will likely cause a collision between them. If that happens, my path is clear. I've made my assessment based on our discussion. Ready for the move phase.
