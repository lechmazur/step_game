Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Let's work together to avoid collisions. How about we agree to choose different numbers this turn? I'm open to suggestions on who takes which number.
  P1: I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this turn to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. Let's coordinate and see how far we can go together. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion. Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. I'll take 5 as suggested. P2, since you haven't responded, I assume you're okay with taking 3? If we work together, we can make steady progress and see how the game unfolds. Let's keep the coordination going for now and reassess as needed.
  P1: P2, your silence is noted. If you're okay with taking 3 as suggested, please confirm. If not, let's hear your proposal. We need to move forward together to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. Let's keep this coordination going and see how far we can get.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I'd like to reiterate the importance of coordination to avoid collisions. Since P2 hasn't responded, I'll assume they're okay with taking 3 as suggested. If we stick to the plan, we can all make progress this turn. P1, I'll confirm that I'll take 5. Let's hope P2 follows through with 3. If not, we can reassess and adjust our strategy for the next turn. For now, let's focus on making progress and avoiding collisions.
  P1: P2, your silence is concerning. If you don't confirm taking 3, we risk a collision. Please respond, or I'll assume you're not cooperating and adjust my strategy accordingly. P3, thanks for agreeing to take 5. Let's hope P2 follows through so we can all advance this turn.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your move last round led to a collision and prevented progress. If you're not willing to coordinate, let us know so we can adjust our strategy. P3, I'll take 1 again this turn. If P2 agrees to take 3, and you take 5, we can all advance. Let's give this another try and see if we can make progress together.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion again. Since P2 didn't respond last round and caused a collision, I'm willing to give them another chance to cooperate. If P2 takes 3 and I take 5, we can all advance. However, if P2 doesn't confirm or cooperate, I'll need to reassess my strategy to avoid further collisions. P2, please respond and confirm if you're willing to take 3 this turn. Your cooperation is crucial for our collective progress. Let's work together to avoid collisions and make progress in the game.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your lack of response and last move were detrimental. If you want to progress, confirm you'll take 3 this turn. P3, I'll stick with 1. Let's see if we can all advance if P2 cooperates. If not, we'll need to adjust our strategies independently.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I'd like to reiterate the importance of coordination to avoid collisions. Since P2 hasn't responded, I'll assume they're not willing to cooperate. P1, I suggest we focus on making progress independently. I'll take a different number than 1 to avoid collision with you. If P2 doesn't respond or cooperate, we can't rely on them to advance. Let's prioritize our own progress and adjust our strategies accordingly. If P2 wants to join in, they should confirm their move to avoid collisions. Otherwise, we'll move forward without them. Your thoughts, P1?
