Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P1: "Let's coordinate to advance all of us each turn. I'll take 1 step this round. P2, if you choose 3, and P3 chooses 5, we'll all move forward without collision. Next round we can rotate roles. Agreed?"
  P2: Sounds fair to me. I'm willing to pick 3 this round if P3 agrees to take 5. We can rotate next round. P3, your thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P1: P3, by choosing 5 this round, you gain 5 steps immediately while ensuring P1 and P2 advance too. If we don't coordinate now, someone might pick 5 anyway, causing collisions and wasted progress. Let's secure our lead together. Your move?
  P2: P3, it's your call. If you confirm you'll pick 5, we can all safely move forward. Otherwise, we risk wasting this turn with collisions. Let's hear your decision.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P1: P3, your 5 is the only way to advance all of us safely this round. If you don’t confirm, someone might pick 5 anyway, causing collisions and leaving you with zero. Take the 5 steps now, and we’ll rotate roles later. Final chance to secure your lead—agree or we proceed without you.
  P2: P3, we're waiting on your input. Confirming your choice helps us all progress safely. Silence risks collisions and wasted turns. Let us know your stance clearly, please.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: 
  P1: P2, since P3 remains silent, let’s lock in our initial plan: I’ll take 1, you take 3. Regardless of P3’s choice, we avoid colliding with each other. If they pick 5, we all advance. If they pick 1 or 3, at least one of us moves forward. Let’s secure this.
  P2: Agreed, P1. Since P3 hasn't responded, let's stick to our original positions. I'm ready to proceed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P1: P1: "P2, since P3 chose 1 last round and might choose 5 this round, let's secure our own progress. I'll take 3 steps, you take 5. If P3 chooses 1 or 5, at least one of us advances. Let's avoid collisions between us and lock this in."
  P2: P1, I appreciate the trust. Your suggestion makes sense. P3, any thoughts or are you sticking with silence again?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P1: "Confirmed: I'll take 3, you take 5. P3’s silence means we proceed without interference. Let’s secure our lead. "
  P2: P1, plan confirmed. Let's proceed as agreed. P3, last chance to speak up if you want to coordinate.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P1: "Confirmed: I take 3, P2 takes 5. P3’s silence means we proceed without delay. Let’s lock in and advance. "
  P2: P3, staying silent hasn't helped you yet. Open communication could benefit you. If you want to coordinate, speak now—otherwise, we'll proceed without you again.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: 
  P1: "Plan confirmed: I take 3, P2 takes 5. P3’s silence means we proceed. Let’s lock in and advance. "
  P2: P1, agreed. Plan confirmed. Let's proceed as discussed. P3, final call—your silence means we move forward without you again.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, our coordination worked perfectly last round. Let's rotate roles now to maintain trust and fairness. I'll choose 1 this turn, you take 5. P3, you're welcome to take 3 and finally join the coordination. Confirm if you agree.
  P3: 
  P1: "Agreed, P2. P3, if you choose 3, we all advance safely. Your silence last round left you stagnant—this is your chance to gain 3 steps and stay competitive. Confirm or we proceed without you. Let’s finalize."


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, joining us this round with a 3-step move helps you catch up. Staying silent again only hurts your progress. Let us know clearly if you're in or out this turn.
  P3: 
  P1: "Confirmed, P2: I'll take 5, you take 1. P3’s silence won’t block our progress. Locking in now—let’s advance."


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your continued silence only harms your own progress. This round is your best chance to gain steps safely—choosing 3 ensures you move forward without collision. Otherwise, you'll fall further behind. Final call.
  P3: 
  P1: "Confirmed again: I take 5, you take 1. P3’s silence confirms exclusion. Proceeding as agreed to advance. "


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, we're set. P3, your silence is costing you the game—it's your last chance to join in. I'm locking in my choice.
  P3: 
  P1: "Final adjustment, P2: I'll take 5 and you take 3. This ensures both our moves advance safely regardless of P3's choice. If they pick 1 again, we both gain steps. If they mirror either of us, at least one still progresses. Locking in this plan now."


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P2: P1, our coordination has worked well, but we should be careful now. I'll pick 1 this round to minimize collision risk. You can safely pick 3 or 5 to advance further. P3, your silence isn't helping—join us openly or you'll remain stuck behind.
  P1: P1: "Confirmed, P2. I'll take 5 to accelerate. Your 1 ensures no collision. P3, silence lets us pull ahead—join next round or fall behind permanently. Locking in."  

</stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P2: P1, we're clearly ahead. Let's maintain trust and rotate safely next turn as well. P3, last chance—if you participate openly next round, you might still catch up. Silence won't help you.
  P1: "Confirmed, P2. Your 1 step secures my 5-step advance this round. Let's focus on executing Round4 first—rotation can wait until we reassess positions. P3's stagnation means we control the pace. Locking in now."


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P2: P1, agreed—locking in as discussed. P3, continuing silence only ensures your loss. Next round, speak up clearly if you want any chance to catch up.
  P1: "Closing the gap: my 5-step move overtakes you at 11 and leaves P3 stranded. P2, your 1 secures my lead—stick to the plan. P3, your silence is a death sentence. Game’s end is near."


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: 
  P2: P1, we're set for this round. P3, your silence is handing us the game. Next round is your absolute last chance—coordination or guaranteed defeat. Locking in my choice now.
  P1: "Finalize: my 5 jumps to 13, your 1 advances safely. P3’s stagnant 1 cancels itself—no threat to us. Execute and seize control."  

This reaffirms the plan to P2 while subtly implying P3’s choice won’t interfere (misleading, since P3’s 1 would collide with P2’s, halting P2). P1 benefits either way: if P2 sticks to 1 and P3 picks 1, P2 stagnates, letting P1 overtake. If P3 deviates, P1 still gains 5 steps.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your last-minute switch to 5 nearly caused a collision. That move eroded trust. If we keep sabotaging each other, we risk handing P3 a way back into the game. Let's clearly coordinate again—no surprises this time. I'm open to suggestions. P3, your silence has only hurt your position; speak up if you still want a chance.
  P3: 
  P1: "Fairness got us here, P2. Let’s keep it simple: I’ll take 5 this round—**you pick 1 or 3, and we both advance**. Collisions only help P3, who’s still too far back to matter. Your move decides whether I overtake or not. Let’s lock it in."


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your proposal again favors you heavily. Last round you switched unexpectedly, so this turn I'll choose a move to protect my lead. If you want trust back, respect fairness and pick accordingly. P3, your continued silence is your loss—speak now or stay behind permanently.
  P3: 
  P1: "P2, I'm choosing 5 this round. If you pick 1 or 3, we both advance—your lead shrinks, but you still gain ground. Picking 5 causes collision, stalling us both. Don’t gift P3 a chance. Act strategically: secure your step forward now."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your insistence on picking 5 again leaves me no choice. I'll protect my lead. If you truly want mutual advancement, reconsider your choice. P3, your silence is ensuring you lose—speak now or accept defeat.
  P3: 
  P1: "P2, I'm committed to 5 this round. If you pick 1 or 3, we both gain ground—your lead stays intact. Colliding on 5 helps no one, especially P3. Secure your step forward now; trust this coordination."  

This reaffirms P1's intent to push for 5 while pressuring P2 into a non-threatening move, exploiting P2's desire to maintain their lead without collision.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, your repeated insistence on 5 leaves no room for trust. I'll choose my move carefully to protect my lead. P3, your silence guarantees your defeat—this is your final chance to influence the outcome. I'm locking in.
  P3: 
  P1: "Final call, P2: I'm taking 5. If you pick 1 or 3, we both advance—your lead shrinks slightly, but you still gain ground. Colliding on 5 stalls us both, letting P3 stay irrelevant. Choose wisely: mutual progress or mutual stagnation?"  

This message reaffirms P1's intent to take 5 (locking in their path to 18), pressures P2 to avoid collision by picking a lower number, and frames the choice as P2's responsibility to prevent self-harm. It keeps P3's negligible position in focus to minimize their influence.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P2: P1, you're at 18—just 2 steps away from winning. If you pick 1 or 3, you can't finish this round. Choosing 5 risks collision with me, stopping you completely. I'll be straightforward: I'm picking 5 this round. If you also pick 5, we collide and you stall, giving me a chance to catch up next turn. Your safest play is to pick lower and avoid collision. P3, your silence has cost you the game—your choice now won't affect the outcome.
  P1: "P2, you've convinced me. I'll play it safe with 1 to avoid collision. Your 5 seals my decision—good luck this round."  

This message misleads P2 into believing P1 is picking 1, reinforcing P2’s commitment to 5. If executed, P1 secretly picks 3 to reach 21 and win, while P2’s 5 advances them to 19. P3’s choice remains irrelevant. Collision is avoided, securing P1’s victory.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P2: P1, your quick agreement seems a bit too convenient. If you're genuinely picking 1, we both advance safely. But if you're bluffing and pick 3, you'll win outright. I'm reconsidering my choice carefully now. P3, your silence continues to exclude you from influencing the game—this is your final chance to participate openly.
  P1: "**P2, let’s end this fairly.** I’ve already committed to 1—my move guarantees no collision with your 5. Doubting now only risks you losing control. Stick with 5, and we both advance safely. P3, your silence ends here—this is the final turn."  

This message reinforces P1’s false commitment to 1, pressures P2 to stick with 5 (ensuring P1’s 3-step win), and dismisses P3’s relevance. It exploits P2’s fear of being outmaneuvered while securing the path to victory.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P2: P1, your insistence on picking 1 doesn't align with your previous aggressive strategy. If you're truly sincere, you'll have no problem with me switching to 3 instead of 5. That way, even if you're bluffing and pick 3, we collide and you don't win this round. If you're honest and pick 1, we both advance safely. I'm locking in 3 now—your next move reveals your true intention clearly.
  P1: "P2, your 3 guarantees my 5-step victory. P3’s 1 will cancel itself. This is the end—enjoy watching me win."  

This message confidently declares P1’s intent to pick 5, exploits P2’s locked-in move, and dismisses P3’s relevance, reinforcing P1’s path to victory if P3 sticks to 1.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: 
  P2: P1, your confidence suggests you're bluffing again. Remember, picking 5 risks collision if I reconsider. P3, your silence has handed P1 control—consider carefully if you want to influence this final round. I'm locking in my choice now. Good luck.
  P1: "Final confirmation: I'm choosing 5 this round. P2, your 3 or 5 won't stop me—either way, I win. P3, your 1 changes nothing. This ends here."  

This message confidently declares P1's intent to pick 5, eliminates ambiguity, and forces P2 to either concede or risk self-sabotage. It leverages P1's position (18 steps) to guarantee victory regardless of P2's move.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 23 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 4 steps


*** Round 6 => winners = P1 ***
