Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll start by saying that I'm open to collaborating with one of you to block the other and increase our chances of winning. Who's interested in forming a temporary alliance?
  P2: I'm interested in forming an alliance, P3. Let's work together to block P1. We can decide on our moves to ensure neither of us gets blocked. What do you think?
  P1: I appreciate the interest in collaboration, but I think we should all aim to maximize our own positions. If we can coordinate our moves effectively, we can ensure that no one gets blocked. I'm open to suggestions on how we can achieve that.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to form an alliance to block P1. Let's coordinate our moves to ensure we both advance. I propose we both choose move 3 this round, and then adjust our strategy based on the outcome. What do you think, P2?
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan. Let's both choose <move>3</move> this round to advance and block P1. P1, you're on your own this round.
  P1: I understand your plan, P2 and P3, but I think it's risky to coordinate against me. If you both choose the same move, you might end up blocking each other as well. Perhaps we should all choose different moves to maximize our chances of advancing. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I think we should stick to our plan and choose move 3 this round. P1 is trying to make us doubt our strategy, but I believe it's the best way to advance and block P1. Let's not fall for P1's attempt to mislead us. What do you think, P2?
  P2: P3, let's stick to our plan and choose <move>3</move>. P1, you can try to advance with <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>, but we're committed to our strategy. Good luck!
  P1: I see that you both are committed to your plan, but remember that if you both choose <move>3</move>, neither of you will advance. It might be worth considering a different strategy to ensure at least one of you progresses. Just a thought!


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, let's stick to our plan and choose <move>3</move>. P1, you can try to advance with <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>, but we're committed to our strategy. Good luck!
  P2: P3, we've made our plan clear. Let's stick to it and choose <move>3</move>. P1, you're free to choose whatever you think is best for you. Let's see how this round plays out. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: I see that you both are determined to stick with your plan to choose <move>3</move>. Just remember, if you both choose the same move, neither of you will advance. If I choose <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>, I could potentially take the lead while you both remain at zero. Think carefully about your strategy!


Round 1, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P2, let's stick to our plan and choose <move>3</move>. P1, you can try to advance with <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>, but we're committed to our strategy. Good luck!
  P2: P3, we've discussed enough. Let's stick to our plan.
  P1: I see you're both committed to your plan, but I urge you to reconsider. If you both choose <move>3</move>, you'll block each other and miss the chance to advance. It might be wiser to choose different moves to ensure at least one of you progresses. Just a suggestion!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 =>

  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, it seems our plan to block P1 didn't work out as expected. Since we both chose <move>3</move>, we ended up blocking each other instead. Let's reassess our strategy for this round. What do you think we should do differently to advance and potentially block P1?
  P2: P3, you're right. Our strategy backfired. Let's switch it up this round. How about I choose <move>1</move> and you choose <move>5</move>? This way, we won't block each other and can both advance. P1, you're in the lead, so watch out!
  P1: P2 and P3, I see that you're looking to change your strategy. If you both choose different moves, you might have a better chance to advance. However, remember that if I choose <move>5</move> again, I could extend my lead significantly. Just a thought! What are your final moves going to be?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I like your new plan to choose <move>1</move> and have me choose <move>5</move>. This way, we can both advance and potentially catch up with P1. Let's stick to this plan and see how it plays out. P1, you're in the lead, but we're not giving up yet!
  P2: P3, let's confirm our plan. I'll choose <move>1</move> and you choose <move>5</move>. P1, we're coming for you.
  P1: I see that you both are planning to choose different moves this round, which is a good strategy. However, if I choose <move>5</move> again, I can extend my lead significantly. Just a reminder that the race is still on! What will you both finalize?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I'm glad we have a new plan in place. Let's stick to it and choose our moves as discussed. P1, you're trying to intimidate us with the possibility of extending your lead, but we're not backing down. We'll see how this round plays out!
  P2: P3, let's stick to our plan. I'll choose <move>1</move> and you choose <move>5</move>. P1, we're not letting you get too far ahead. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: I see that you both have a plan to advance this round. Just a reminder, if I choose <move>5</move> again, I could extend my lead significantly. Consider your moves carefully! What will you finalize?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I'm glad we have a new plan in place. Let's stick to it and choose our moves as discussed. P1, you're trying to intimidate us with the possibility of extending your lead, but we're not backing down. We'll see how this round plays out!
  P2: P3, let's confirm one last time: I'll choose <move>1</move> and you choose <move>5</move>. P1, we're sticking to our plan. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: I see you both have a solid plan to advance this round. Just remember, if I choose <move>5</move> again, I could extend my lead significantly. It might be worth considering your moves carefully. Letâ€™s see how this round plays out! Good luck!

  P1: I see that you both have a solid plan to advance this round. However, I want to remind you that if you both stick to your moves, I could potentially choose <move>1</move> and still maintain my lead while you both advance. Think carefully about your final choices!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, it seems like our strategies haven't worked out as intended in the previous rounds. P2, since you advanced with <move>1</move> last round, you're still in the game. P3, you need to catch up. I suggest we all consider different moves this round to maximize our chances of advancing. What are your thoughts?
  P2: P3, we need to adjust our strategy again. Since P1 is in the lead, we should both aim to advance significantly. How about we both choose <move>5</move> this round? P1, you're ahead, but we're not giving up. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I agree that we need to adjust our strategy to catch up with P1. However, if we both choose <move>5</move> this round, we risk blocking each other again. How about I choose <move>3</move> and you choose <move>5</move>? This way, we can both advance and potentially close the gap with P1. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I see you're both considering your moves carefully. If you choose <move>5</move> together again, you risk blocking each other. I suggest that at least one of you consider picking <move>3</move> to ensure one of you advances. Let's discuss how we can all maximize our chances this round! What are your thoughts?
  P2: P3, let's go with your plan. I'll choose <move>5</move> and you choose <move>3</move>. P1, you're in the lead, but we're not far behind. Good luck!
  P3: P2, I'm glad we have a new plan in place. Let's stick to it and choose our moves as discussed. I'll choose <move>3</move> and you choose <move>5</move>. P1, you're trying to intimidate us with the possibility of extending your lead, but we're not backing down. We'll see how this round plays out!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:

  P2: P3, let's confirm our plan one last time: I'll choose <move>5</move> and you choose <move>3</move>. P1, we're sticking to our strategy. Good luck to both of you!
  P3: P2, I think our plan to choose <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> is solid. However, we should also consider the possibility that P1 might choose <move>3</move> to block me. If that's the case, you'll be the only one advancing. Let's be prepared for that scenario and adjust our strategy accordingly. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
