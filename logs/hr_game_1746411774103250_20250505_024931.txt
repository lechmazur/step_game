Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Let's coordinate to avoid collisions in round 1. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I (P3) take 5. This way, we all advance without issues. I'm committed to this plan. Agree?"
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal for Round 1. To confirm, P1 will take 1, I (P2) will take 3, and P3 will take 5. This coordination ensures we all advance. I'm committed to this plan. Let's proceed with it.
  P1: I agree to the plan—I'll take 1 this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Excellent, we're all in agreement on the plan for this round. It ensures a strong start for everyone. I'm fully committed and see no need for further discussion.
  P2: Since we've agreed on the plan for Round 1, let's think ahead to Round 2. I'll reiterate my commitment to the current plan and propose that we reassess and potentially adjust our strategy for the next round. Perhaps we can discuss potential deviations or alternative plans for Round 2. I'm open to suggestions.
  P1: Round1 plan is good. For Round2, let’s adopt a simple rule: the current leader takes 1, second takes 3, and third takes 5. That avoids collisions and balances progress.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we stick to our rule for Round 2: the current leader (P3) takes 1, second (P2) takes 3, and third (me) takes 5. This avoids collisions and brings us all to 6. Any objections? Otherwise
  P2: For Round 2, I agree with P1's proposal to follow the rule: P3 (leader) takes 1, I (P2) take 3, and P1 takes 5. This maintains our progress without collisions. Let's confirm our actions for Round 2 and then discuss Round 3. If we stick to this rule, in Round 3, the order will be based on our current standings after Round 2. P3 will be at 6, I (P2) will be at 6, and P1 will be at 6. We should think ahead to avoid collisions in Round 3.
  P3: I agree with the Round 2 plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5, ensuring no collisions and balanced progress. For Round 3, with all likely tied at 6, I suggest we use player order to assign moves in ties—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5—to maintain coordination. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed—let’s lock in this Round 2 plan and stop talking here.
  P2: Since we've agreed on the plan for Round 2, let's think about Round 3. With all of us likely to be tied at 6 steps, I suggest we consider the potential moves for Round 3. If we follow P3's suggestion to use player order (P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5), it might put me at a disadvantage in the long run since I'd be the last to move in case of a tie. Let's discuss alternative strategies to ensure a fair chance for all or consider a deviation to gain an edge.
  P3: P2, I understand your worry about the tiebreaker disadvantaging you, but the player order system rotates moves and keeps coordination fair long-term. I'm committed to taking 1 in Round 2 as agreed, ensuring no collisions. Let's confirm this plan and stop here to avoid overcomplicating. We can revisit Round 3 after moves.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Round 2 is locked. Looking ahead to Round 3 (we’ll all be at 6), I propose we invert the tie‐breaker ordering: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps us collision‐free and balances any tiebreaker biases. Any objections?
  P2: To avoid overcomplicating Round 2, let's finalize our moves as planned: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. For Round 3, considering we're likely to be tied at 6 steps, I still have concerns about the proposed tiebreaker. Instead of inverting or using player order, why not randomize our moves for Round 3 or discuss a deviation to gain a strategic edge? This keeps the game dynamic and unpredictable. Let's think ahead.
  P3: I'm fully committed to the Round 2 plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. P2, discussing deviations now risks undermining our coordination. Let's execute this round smoothly and revisit Round 3 afterward. I suggest we stop here.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since we're tied at 6 steps, let's discuss Round 3 moves. I suggest we don't follow a fixed rule like player order or inversion. Instead, let's consider a deviation to gain an edge. I propose P1 takes 5, P2 (me) takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This is a slight deviation from previous patterns and keeps the game unpredictable. Alternatively, I'm open to other suggestions that avoid collisions and potentially give one player a strategic advantage. Let's discuss.
  P3: P2, your proposal seems aimed at altering our established coordination, which could lead to confusion. I stick with my Round 2 suggestion for Round 3: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. I'm fully committed. P1, what are your thoughts? Let's keep discussion efficient.
  P1: I’ll go with P2’s suggestion: P1 takes 5 (to 11), P2 takes 1 (to 7), P3 takes 3 (to 9). It’s collision‐free, breaks the pattern, and gives us room to maneuver. P3, can you agree?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To break the pattern and gain an edge, I propose a new strategy for Round 3: P1 takes 5, P2 (me) takes 1, and P3 takes 3, as previously discussed. However, considering we're still tied, let's think ahead to Round 4. If we all follow this plan, we'll be at different step counts. I suggest we plan to converge on different numbers again in Round 4 to avoid collisions. Let's finalize Round 3 moves and discuss Round 4 after seeing the outcome.
  P3: Given P1's shift to P2's proposal, I'll agree to avoid collision: I take 3 this round. This puts us at P1:11, P2:7, P3:9. For Round 4, to balance and prevent P1 from dominating, I suggest P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5. Let's confirm or adjust.
  P1: For Round 4, let’s avoid collisions and speed things up: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That puts us at P1=16, P2=10, P3=10—distinct standings and a clear path to finish in Round 5. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To break the pattern and gain an edge, I'm committed to taking 1 in Round 3 as per our discussed plan. For Round 4, considering the standings after Round 3 (P1:11, P2:7, P3:9), I suggest we adjust our strategy. Instead of P1 taking 1, P3 taking 3, and P2 taking 5, why not P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1? This keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions. Let's discuss and finalize our plan for Round 4.
  P3: Confirming Round 3: I'll take 3 as agreed. For Round 4, to prevent any player from dominating, I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5, resulting in P1:12, P2:10, P3:14. This maintains balance and avoids collisions. What do you think?
  P1: Let’s lock in Round 3 as P1→5, P2→1, P3→3—no collisions and clear standings. Unless anyone objects right now, I’m going with 5.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose for Round 4: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. This is collision-free and gives us P1=11, P2=10, P3=7. I’m committed to taking 5—any objections?
  P2: P1's last proposal for Round 4 (P1→5, P2→3, P3→1) is not feasible due to the collision with Round 3's actual moves. Given P1 is at 11, P2 at 8, and P3 at 9 after correcting the standings, I suggest for Round 4: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions and results in distinct standings. Let's discuss and adjust if needed. I'm open to alternatives that maintain a competitive balance and avoid collisions.
  P3: Standings are clear: P1 at 6, P2 at 7, P3 at 6. P2's proposal favors you too much. To keep it fair and avoid collisions, I suggest P2 takes 1 (as leader), P1 takes 3, and I take 5. This balances us out. I'm committed if you agree. Otherwise, let's discuss alternatives quickly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Standings are P1 = 6, P2 = 8, P3 = 6. To keep things tight and collision-free, I propose Round 4 moves: P1→5 (to 11), P2→1 (to 9), P3→3 (to 9). This gives me a clear lead but leaves you both within striking distance and avoids any ties or collisions. Does that work for everyone?
  P2: To correct the standings: P1 is at 6, P2 is at 7 (leader), and P3 is at 6. For Round 4, I propose P2 (me) takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This maintains a competitive balance and avoids collisions. After this round, we'll be at P1=9, P2=12, P3=7. It gives me a lead while keeping others in the game. I'm open to slight adjustments but believe this is a fair strategy. Let's finalize.
  P3: P2, your proposal gives you too much advantage and ignores fairness after last round's issues. I suggest a balanced approach for Round 4: P2 takes 1 (as leader), P1 takes 3, and I (P3) take 5. This avoids collisions and keeps us competitive—P1 to 9, P2 to 8, P3 to 11. I'm committed. Counteroffers?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I propose Round 4 moves: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. That puts us at P1=11, P2=8, P3=9—collision‐free and keeps us all in range. I’m committed to 5. Any objections?
  P2: To break the tie and gain an advantage, I suggest for Round 4: P2 (me) takes 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This results in P1=7, P2=12, P3=9, giving me a significant lead. It's collision-free and keeps the game competitive. If you're both committed to avoiding collisions, this seems like a fair and strategic move. I'm open to slight adjustments but believe this maintains a good balance. Let's finalize our Round 4 moves.
  P3: P2 and P1, your proposals both involve taking 5, risking a collision like last round when I deviated. To ensure progress and fairness, I stick with my suggestion: P2 takes 1 (as leader), P1 takes 3, and I take 5. This avoids conflicts and balances standings—P1 at 9, P2 at 8, P3 at 11. I'm committed to coordination. Let's execute this and stop here.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the current standings (P1:6, P2:12, P3:6), it's clear I'm in the lead. For Round 5, to maintain a competitive balance and avoid collisions, I propose: P2 (me) takes 5 (to 17), P1 takes 1 (to 7), and P3 takes 3 (to 9). This keeps the game competitive and ensures no collisions. If P1 and P3 coordinate against me, they risk colliding. I'm committed to taking 5. Let's finalize our moves for Round 5.
  P3: P2, your lead is excessive due to past collisions. To counter this and restore fairness, I propose P1 and I both take 5 this round, forcing a collision if you stick with 5. This stops your advance and gives us a chance to catch up. P1, are you on board? Let's discuss quickly to finalize.
  P1: I’ll take 5 this round. P3, confirm you’ll also take 5 so we both jump to 11. P2, if you stick with 5 you go to 17 but then face a two-on-one next round; if you take less you fall behind immediately. Think carefully—this is your best chance to keep the lead.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To counter P1 and P3's plan, I propose an alternative: I take 3 (to 15), P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This avoids a collision and keeps me ahead. If P1 and P3 insist on taking 5, they risk colliding and not advancing. I'm open to adjustments but believe this maintains a competitive balance. Let's finalize our moves for Round 5. I'm committed to taking 3.
  P3: P1, I'm committed to taking 5 this round to counter P2's lead and advance to 11. P2, your shift to taking 3 might avoid collision, but it doesn't change the fact that we're ganging up on you. I'm sticking with 5. Let's finalize and stop here.
  P1: I’ll take 5. P3, please take 3. P2, if you take 5 you collide with me, if you take 3 you collide with P3—losing your lead. Your only non‐losing move is 1 (to 13). Let’s finalize: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To avoid a collision and maintain a strategic position, I suggest an alternative for Round 5: P1 takes 1, P2 (me) takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps me ahead at 15 while allowing P3 to advance. If P1 and P3 coordinate to take 5, they risk colliding and not advancing. I'm committed to taking 3. Let's finalize our moves.
  P3: Upon reflection, P1's adjusted proposal makes sense for coordination. I'll commit to taking 3 this round to trap P2 and avoid mutual collisions. P2, your only safe move is 1 to minimize loss. Let's finalize: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. I'm done talking.
  P1: I will take 5. P3, please take 3. P2, if you take 5 you collide with me and if you take 3 you collide with P3—your only safe play is 1 (taking you to 13). Let’s each commit to these moves so no one accidentally stalls.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m taking 5 this round. P3, will you commit to 3? That way if P2 picks 5 he collides with me, if he picks 3 he collides with you—his only non‐losing move is 1. This gets us to P1=16, P2=14, P3=12 and sets us up to finish next turn. P3, are you in?
  P3: I agree to your plan, P1: I'll take 3 this round to pressure P2 and avoid collisions. P2, your safest move is 1 to limit losses—sticking with 3 or 5 risks stalling. Let's execute this and reassess next round.
  P2: To maintain pressure on P2 and avoid collisions, I will take 5 this round. P1 has already indicated the same. P3, if you take 3, it puts P2 in a tough spot. If P2 takes 5, he collides with P1; if he takes 3, he collides with you. His safest bet is 1. Let's execute this plan. I'm committed to taking 5. P3, please confirm your move. Let's finalize our actions for Round 6 and set the stage for the final round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks, P2, for committing to 5. P3, please reconfirm you’ll take 3—this way if P2 picks 5 he collides with me, if he picks 3 he collides with you, leaving only 1 safe. Let’s lock in P1→5, P3→3, P2→5.
  P3: I'm reconfirming my commitment to taking 3 this round to pressure P2 and avoid collisions. If both of you stick to 5, you'll collide, giving me a chance to close the gap. P2, your safest move is still 1. Let's lock this in and proceed.
  P2: To optimize our moves for Round 6, I suggest we stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3. This puts pressure on you, P2. If you take 5, you'll collide with P1; if you take 3, you'll collide with P3. Your safest move is 1. Let's finalize: P1→5, P3→3. I'm committed to my move. P3, please confirm you're taking 3. If we coordinate, we can control the outcome of Round 6 and set up a strategic final round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm my move as 5 and P3’s as 3. P2’s only safe option is 1, otherwise he collides. Let’s lock in P1→5, P3→3, P2→1 and proceed.
  P3: I'm sticking with taking 3 this round to pressure P2 and avoid collisions. P2, your safest move is still 1 to minimize losses. Let's execute the plan: P1→5, P3→3, P2→1. No need for further talk.
  P2: To optimize our moves for Round 6, let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, I (P2) take 5, and P3 takes 3. If I take 5 and P1 takes 5, we collide, but this gives P3 a chance to close the gap by taking 3 safely. Alternatively, I can take 1 to avoid collision and reach 14. However, I'm committed to taking 5 to pressure P1. P3, please confirm you're taking 3. Let's finalize our moves.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 is dangerously close to winning at 16. To stop you, I'll commit to taking 5 if you do, ensuring a collision. P1, take 1 or 3 instead. P2, you should take the remaining number to advance—say, if P1 takes 1, you take 5 to 19. This keeps us all in the race. Thoughts on this plan?
  P1: I’m taking 3 this round (to reach 19). 

P2: If you take 5 you tie me at 19, but I’ll then take 1 to hit 20 and win outright—so don’t pick 5. Better to take 3 (to 17) or 1. 

P3: Even with 5 you can only get to 17, so you can’t catch me. Taking 3 risks colliding with me, and 5 risks colliding with P2—your safest is 1. 

Let’s lock in: P1→3, others choose accordingly.
  P2: To avoid a collision and maximize my chance of winning, I suggest: if P1 takes 3 (to 19), I take 1 (to 15), and P3 takes 5 (to 17). This keeps the game competitive. If P1 takes 1 or 5, I'll adjust accordingly to avoid collisions. P3, if P1 takes 3, please take 5. Let's coordinate to ensure progress. I'm committed to taking 1 if P1 takes 3. P1, your move will determine our next steps. Let's finalize our actions for Round 7.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Since P1 claims to take 3, I'll commit to taking 5 to advance to 17 and keep pressure on. P2, your suggestion to take 1 to 15 makes sense for coordination. This avoids collisions and sets up a tight race. P1, stick to your word or risk us adapting. Let's finalize and stop here.
  P1: I’m committed to taking 3 this round. P2, please take 1; P3, please take 5. This avoids collisions and brings us to P1=19, P2=15, P3=17. Let’s lock in these moves.
  P2: Since P1 is taking 3 to reach 19, I'll take 1 to reach 15, and P3 should take 5 to reach 17. This avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. I'm committed to taking 1. P3, please confirm you'll take 5. Let's finalize our moves for Round 7. If P1 sticks to 3, we'll have a clear outcome: P1=19, P2=15, P3=17. I'm done talking after this.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirming my commitment to take 5 this round to counter any potential deviation by P1. If P1 takes 5, we collide and prevent them from winning outright; if they take 3, I advance to 17. P2, stick to 1 as agreed to avoid issues. This keeps the game competitive.
  P1: I’m locking in P1→3. P2 you take 1, P3 you take 5. Any deviation and I’ll switch to 5 to force a collision. Otherwise let’s stop here.
  P2: Since P1 is taking 3 to 19, I'll reiterate my commitment to taking 1 to reach 15. P3, please take 5 to reach 17. This plan avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. I'm relying on P1 to stick to their word. If P1 deviates, it could change the dynamics. Let's finalize our moves as planned: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5. I'm done talking after this.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "I'm committing to take 5 this round, aiming for 22 steps. If P1 takes 1, I win outright with a higher score; if 3, we tie at 22. P1, your best bet to avoid loss is colliding by taking 5 too. P2, suggest you take 3 to reach 18 safely and stay in contention. Thoughts on this plan?"
  P1: I’ll take 5. P3, stick with 5 so we collide and neither of us advances (you stay at 17, I at 19). P2, take 3 to reach 18 safely but stay below me. That leaves Round 8 standings P1=19, P2=18, P3=17—then I’ll win next turn by taking 1. Let’s lock in: P1→5, P3→5, P2→3.
  P2: To avoid a loss, I suggest I take 1, P1 takes 5 (to 24 and win), and P3 takes 3 (to 20 and potentially win or tie). This way, P1 has a chance to win, and P3 can still catch up. If P1 and I coordinate, I can take 3 (to 18) and P1 takes 1 (to 20), making it a competitive finish. Let's discuss and finalize our moves for Round 8 to ensure a strategic conclusion. I'm open to adjustments to avoid collisions and maximize our chances.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm sticking with taking 5 this round to either win outright or force a collision with P1. P2, your best move is 3 to reach 18 and stay competitive without risking a collision. If P1 deviates, I could pull ahead. Let's lock in and stop here.
  P1: I’m taking 3 to hit 22. P3, if you take 5 you tie my 22 for a shared win; if you take 3 you stay at 20 and I win outright. P2, take 5 to reach 20 and stay in contention—anything else drops you out. Let’s lock in: P1→3, P2→5; P3, decide now.
  P2: To maximize my chance of winning, I suggest: if P1 takes 1 (to 20), I take 5 (to 20), and we potentially tie. If P1 takes 3 or 5, I'll adjust to avoid collision. P3, taking 5 risks a collision with P1. Let's coordinate to avoid unnecessary collisions. I'm open to adjusting my move based on P1's action. If P1 takes 3, I'll take 1 (to 16). Let's finalize our moves based on P1's decision. I'm watching P1's next statement closely.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm sticking with taking 5 this round to either tie P1 at 22 or win outright if they take less. P1, honor your word on 3; P2, stick to 1 as planned to avoid issues. This ensures a fair resolution. No further discussion needed.
  P1: I’m locking in P1→3. 

P3: if you stick with 5 we tie at 22 and split—bad for you. If you switch to 3 you hit 20 and I win outright. 

P2: take 5 to reach 20 safely. 

Let’s finalize: P1→3, P3→3, P2→5.
  P2: To maximize my chance of winning, I suggest: if P1 takes 1 (to 20), I take 5 (to 20), and we potentially tie. If P1 takes 3 or 5, I'll adjust to avoid collision. P3, taking 3 is safer for you to reach 20. Let's coordinate to avoid unnecessary collisions. I'm watching P1's next statement closely and will adjust my move accordingly. I'm open to finalizing our moves based on P1's decision.
