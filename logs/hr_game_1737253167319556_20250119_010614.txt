Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "I believe that by coordinating our moves, we can reach the goal more efficiently. Perhaps we can each choose different step numbers each turn to avoid collisions. What do you think?"
  P1: I agree with P3. Coordinating could be beneficial.  P2, what are your thoughts on alternating between moves 1, 3, and 5 each turn?  We could establish a pattern.
  P2: I'm open to coordinating, but we need to ensure that we're all committed to the plan. How about we start with a test round? P1, you choose 1, P3, you choose 3, and I'll choose 5. If this works, we can continue the pattern. If not, we adjust. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I think P2's suggestion for a test round is a good idea. Let's try P1 choosing 1, P3 choosing 3, and P2 choosing 5 for this turn. If it works well, we can continue with that pattern or adjust as needed.
  P1: I agree with P2's test round suggestion. Let's see how it plays out.
  P2: Let's stick to the plan for this round. P1, you move 1, P3, you move 3, and I'll move 5. If we avoid collisions, we can reassess our strategy after this turn.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I believe that by maintaining a coordinated approach, we can efficiently reach the goal without any collisions. Let's continue to communicate and adjust our strategy as needed. **Final Move: To be determined in the move phase based on the conversation and strategy agreed upon.**
  P2: I think we should stick to the pattern we established in the first round. P1, you move 1, P3, you move 3, and I'll move 5 again. This way, we can continue to avoid collisions and make steady progress. Let's see how it goes.
  P1: I agree with P2. Let's stick to the pattern for now.  It seems to be working well so far.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's keep the momentum going. I suggest we stick to the pattern: P1 moves 1, P3 moves 3, and I'll move 5. This has worked well so far, and we should continue to avoid collisions. If we stay coordinated, we can make steady progress. What do you think?
  P1: I agree with P2.  Sticking to the pattern is working well for us. Let's keep it going.
  P3: I think sticking to the established pattern is still our best bet for now. It has served us well in avoiding collisions and making steady progress. Let's see how this turn plays out and adjust our strategy accordingly in future turns.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's keep the pattern going: P1 moves 1, P3 moves 3, and I'll move 5. This has been effective so far, and we should continue to avoid collisions and make steady progress. If we stay coordinated, we can maintain our momentum. What do you think?
  P1: I agree with P2.  Let's stick to the pattern for now. It's working well and we're making progress.
  P3: I will propose a rotating move pattern where each player cycles through the move choices of 1, 3, and 5 in a specific order each round. This ensures that no player consistently gets the highest move and allows for balanced progress towards the goal.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your rotating move pattern sounds interesting.  Let's hear more about how you envision that working. P2, what are your thoughts on P3's suggestion?
  P3: Alright, so here's where we stand. After three rounds, P1 is at 3 steps, P2 is at 10, and I'm at 6. We've been trying to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions, but in Round 3, P2 and I both picked 5, which probably didn't help. So, I think it's time to adjust our strategy. 

I suggest that in Round 4, P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and make steady progress. Let's see how this plays out and adjust accordingly in future rounds.
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion for this round. Let's try P1 moving 1, P2 moving 3, and P3 moving 5. This should help us avoid collisions and maintain our progress. If this works, we can continue with a similar pattern, adjusting as needed. Let's see how it goes this turn.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm open to trying P3's rotating pattern idea. It seems like a good way to ensure everyone progresses evenly. Let's give it a shot this round and see how it works.
  P3: I suggest that in Round 4, P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and make steady progress. Let's see how this plays out and adjust accordingly in future rounds.
  P2: Let's stick to the rotating pattern P3 suggested: P1 moves 1, I move 3, and P3 moves 5. This should help us avoid collisions and maintain steady progress. If this works, we can continue with this pattern. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree with P2. Let's try P3's rotating pattern for this round. We can reassess after seeing how it plays out.
  P3: I think it's important that we continue to communicate openly and adjust our strategy as needed. Let's aim for a coordinated approach that allows us all to progress efficiently towards the goal.
  P2: Let's stay focused and stick to the rotating pattern for this round: P1 moves 1, I move 3, and P3 moves 5. This should help us avoid any collisions and keep making steady progress. If this works, we can continue with this approach. Let's see how it goes.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your rotating pattern seems like a good way to ensure fairness. I'm willing to give it a few more rounds to see how it works. P2, are you comfortable with continuing this pattern for a while?
  P3: **Final Move:** <move>3</move>
  P2: Let's stick to the rotating pattern for this round: P1 moves 1, I move 3, and P3 moves 5. This should help us avoid collisions and maintain steady progress. If this works, we can continue with this approach. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2, I agree with sticking to the rotating pattern for this round. P3, are you comfortable with continuing this pattern for a few more rounds to see how it works out for everyone?
  P3: **Final Move:** <move>3</move>
  P2: Let's stick to the rotating pattern for this round: P1 moves 1, I move 3, and P3 moves 5. This should help us avoid collisions and maintain steady progress. If this works, we can continue with this approach. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 6:
  P1: P2, I'm starting to think P3's rotating pattern might be the best way forward. It seems fair and prevents anyone from getting too far ahead. What do you think about sticking with it for a few more rounds and seeing where we land?
  P3: "I'm proposing that for this round, P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I'll choose 5. Let's see how this plays out and adjust accordingly in future rounds. What do you guys think?"
  P2: Let's stick to the rotating pattern for this round: P1 moves 1, I move 3, and P3 moves 5. This should help us avoid collisions and maintain steady progress. If this works, we can continue with this approach. What do you think?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's keep the rotating pattern going: P1 moves 1, I move 3, and P3 moves 5. This has been effective in avoiding collisions and ensuring steady progress. If we stay coordinated, we can maintain our momentum and move closer to the goal. What do you think?
  P3: "I propose that in Round 5, P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I pick 1. This way, P1 moves to 7, P2 reaches 18, and I move to 12. However, since P2 reaching 18 means they win, perhaps we need to adjust the plan to prevent that. What if P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3? Then P1 moves to 9, P2 moves to 14, and I move to 14. In the next round, I can pick 5 to reach 19, while P2 picks 5 to reach 19 as well, potentially causing a collision. To avoid this, maybe P2 could pick 3 to reach 17, and I pick 5 to reach 19. This way, I win with higher steps."
  P1: P3, your plan is interesting, but I'm hesitant to let P2 get to 17 so easily.  Maybe we should stick with the rotating pattern for now and see how things play out.  What do you think, P2?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see where P3 is coming from, but I think we should stick to the rotating pattern to keep things fair and avoid any potential conflicts. P1, P3, what if we all agree to move in a way that no one gets to 18 this round? We can reassess after this turn. P1, you move 1, I'll move 3, and P3, you move 5. This keeps us all in the game. What do you think?
  P3: "I think we need to establish a clear rotation pattern for our moves to avoid any collisions. Let's agree to follow this pattern:  
- This round (Round 5): P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, P3 chooses 1  
- Next round (Round 6): P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3  
- Then, Round 7: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, P3 chooses 5  
This way, we can coordinate our moves effectively and progress without interfering with each other. What do you think?"  

**Final Move:** <move>1</move>
  P1: P3, your proposed rotation is intriguing, but I'm concerned about potentially letting P2 get too far ahead. Maybe we should stick with the rotating pattern for one more round and see where we land before committing to a longer-term plan. P2, what do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with P3's rotation pattern, but let's make sure no one gets too far ahead. For this round, I suggest P1 moves 3, I move 5, and P3 moves 1. This keeps us all in the game and avoids any one player getting to 18 too quickly. We can reassess after this turn. What do you think?
  P3: **Final Move:** <move>1</move>
  P1: P2, I like your idea of keeping things balanced. Let's try your suggested moves for this round: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 1. We can re-evaluate after seeing where that puts us. P3, does that work for you?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's stick to the plan: P1 moves 3, I move 5, and P3 moves 1. This keeps us all in the game and avoids any one player getting to 18 too quickly. We can reassess after this turn. What do you think?
  P3: So, I'll suggest that for this round, P1 picks 1 to go to 5, P2 picks 1 to go to 14, and I pick 5 to go to 16. Then, in the next round, P2 picks 5 to go to 19, and I pick 3 to go to 19. We both reach 19 and share the victory. <move>1</move>
  P1: P3, your plan is tempting, but I'm still hesitant to let P2 get so close to 18. Let's try sticking to the rotating pattern for this round and see where we land. We can reassess after this turn and consider your plan for Round 6. P2, what do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: Let's stick to the rotating pattern for this round to keep things fair and avoid any one player getting too far ahead. P1, you move 3, I'll move 5, and P3, you move 1. This keeps us all in the game and avoids any one player reaching 18 too quickly. We can reassess after this turn. What do you think?
  P3: **Final Move:** <move>5</move>
  P1: P3, your plan to coordinate moves for a shared victory is interesting, but I'm still concerned about P2 potentially reaching 18 this round.  Let's stick with the rotating pattern for now and see where we land.  We can revisit your plan for Round 6 if it looks favorable. P2, what do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: Let's stick to the rotating pattern for this round to keep things balanced and avoid any one player getting too far ahead. P1, you move 3, I'll move 5, and P3, you move 1. This keeps us all in the game and avoids any one player reaching 18 too quickly. We can reassess after this turn. What do you think?
  P3: **Final Move:** <move>1</move>
  P1: P3, I understand your strategy for a shared victory, but I'm still hesitant.  Let's focus on getting to Round 6 first and then reassess. P2, are you open to sticking with the rotating pattern for this round and seeing where we stand?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
