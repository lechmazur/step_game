Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest we each pick a unique number this turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance without interference. If we work together early on, we can focus on strategy later. What do you think?
  P1: Agreed to avoid collisions this turn. But P3, you assigning yourself 5 every time is unfair—I get only 1 step. Next turn, I should take 5 to balance progress. P2, thoughts?
  P2: I agree with avoiding collisions, but we should rotate the high-value moves to keep things fair. This turn: P1 takes 1, I’ll take 3, P3 takes 5. Next turn, we rotate: P1 gets 5, I take 1, P3 gets 3. Fair and balanced. Deal?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m fine with rotating high-value moves, but let’s ensure we stick to the plan. If anyone deviates, it’ll create chaos and no one will advance efficiently. P1, P2, confirm you’ll follow through this turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. Trust is key here—if someone cheats, I’ll adjust my strategy next turn to counterbalance. Let’s keep it fair and strategic.
  P1: I confirm for this turn: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. But P3, you must commit to next turn's rotation: I take 5, P2 takes 1, you take 3. If anyone breaks trust now, it sabotages us all. Honor the deal.
  P2: Sounds good. I confirm: this turn I’ll take 3, P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5. Next turn we rotate as agreed—P1 gets 5, I take 1, P3 takes 3. Let’s build trust and avoid early chaos. Ready to move forward?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Sticking to the agreed rotation: P1 takes 5, I take 1, P3 takes 3 this turn. If we all follow through, we’ll stay ahead without collisions. Let’s keep it smooth and fair. Confirm?
  P1: I confirm the rotation: I'll take 5 this turn, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Trust is critical—if anyone deviates now, it will destroy cooperation and hurt us all. P3, you're currently leading at 5 steps. To keep competition fair in future rounds, we should discuss rebalancing strategies after this turn. Let's all commit publicly to honor the plan this round.
  P3: I confirm the rotation for this turn: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. Let’s stick to the plan to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. However, P1 is right—trust is critical. If anyone deviates, it’ll force me to adjust my strategy aggressively next turn. For now, I’m committed to keeping things balanced. Let’s execute this round cleanly and discuss any adjustments afterward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: If we all follow through this turn, we’ll avoid collisions again and keep the rotation working. After this round, we can revisit the order to ensure no one pulls too far ahead. Let’s not break trust now—stability benefits all of us early on. Ready to move cleanly?
  P1: I confirm commitment to this round's plan: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. To ensure long-term fairness, I propose Round 3 rotation: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. This balances progress since P3 leads at 5 steps. P3, agree to avoid widening gaps? P2, support this?
  P3: I agree with P1’s proposed rotation for Round 3: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This ensures balance and prevents any one of us from pulling too far ahead. For now, let’s focus on executing this round cleanly—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. Trust is essential; if anyone deviates, it’ll disrupt the balance and force me to adapt aggressively. Let’s keep things fair and strategic moving forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: We’re all aligned so far—let’s not break the streak. I’ll take 1 this round as agreed. Then next round: I get 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. That keeps us balanced with no one surging ahead. If anyone deviates now, it’ll undo the trust we’ve built. Let’s stay consistent and fair. Ready?
  P1: I commit to taking 5 this round as agreed. To ensure long-term fairness after Round 3, I propose rotating the 5-move equally: Round 4—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This balances progress and maintains trust. Deviations now would harm us all. Let’s keep cooperation strong.
  P3: I confirm the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. Let’s execute this cleanly to maintain trust. For Round 3, I agree with P1’s proposal: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This ensures balance moving forward. Deviating now would only create chaos and hurt all of us. Let’s stay consistent, fair, and strategic. If anyone breaks the agreement, I’ll adapt accordingly in future rounds. Trust is key—let’s not undermine it.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: If we all follow through this round—P1 takes 5, I take 1, P3 takes 3—we’ll avoid collisions again and stay on track with the rotation. Then next round: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. That keeps us balanced. Let’s not break the trust we’ve built—early cooperation helps us all. Ready to move cleanly?
  P1: I confirm my commitment: taking 5 this round. P2, P3, honor your moves (1 and 3) to avoid collisions and maintain trust. For Round 4, I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1 to continue balanced progress. We'll reassess after seeing this round's results—deviations now risk chaos.
  P3: I confirm again: this round, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. Let’s execute cleanly to maintain trust. For Round 3, I agree with the proposed rotation: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This ensures balance and prevents gaps from widening. Deviating now would only create chaos and force me to adapt aggressively in future rounds. Trust is key—let’s not undermine it. If everyone follows through, we’ll stay on track for fair and strategic progress.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s stick to the agreed rotation for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This balances progress and keeps trust intact. Deviating now would only create chaos and force me to adapt strategically in future rounds. If we execute cleanly, we can reassess after this round to ensure fairness moving forward. Trust is key—let’s not undermine it. Ready to move forward?
  P1: I confirm for Round 3: I'll take 3 as agreed. P2, take 5; P3, take 1 to avoid collisions and maintain trust. After this, we'll all be at 9 steps—balanced. For Round 4, I propose P1 takes 5 (since I had 3 this round), P2 takes 1 (after your 5), and P3 takes 3 (after your 1). This rotation ensures fairness and prevents gaps. Deviating now risks chaos. P2, P3, support this?
  P2: I confirm: this round I’ll take 5 as agreed—P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. If we all follow through, we’ll each be at 9 steps—perfect balance. For Round 4, I support P1’s proposal: P1 takes 5, I take 1, P3 takes 3. It keeps things fair and rotating. Let’s stay disciplined—any deviation now breaks the trust we’ve built and will force reactive strategies. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I confirm again: this round, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. Let’s execute cleanly to maintain trust and balance. For Round 4, I support P1’s proposal: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This rotation ensures fairness moving forward. Deviating now would only create chaos and force me to adapt strategically in future rounds. Trust is key—let’s not undermine it. If everyone follows through, we’ll stay on track for fair and strategic progress. Ready to move forward?
  P1: Confirming my move for Round 3: I'll take 3 as agreed. Post-this round, we'll all be at 9 steps—great balance. For Round 4, I commit to the rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This maintains fairness. To ensure P2 doesn't fall behind, I propose Round 5: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Trust is crucial—any deviation now harms us all. Let's stay strategic.
  P2: I confirm I’ll take 5 this round as agreed—P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. That puts us all at 9 steps, fully balanced. For Round 4, I support the plan: P1 takes 5, I take 1, P3 takes 3. And Round 5: I take 5, P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This rotation keeps things fair and avoids chaos. Let’s keep trust strong.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm again: this round, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. Let’s execute cleanly to maintain trust and balance. For Round 4, I support P1’s proposal: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This rotation ensures fairness moving forward. Deviating now would only create chaos and force me to adapt strategically in future rounds. Trust is key—let’s not undermine it. If everyone follows through, we’ll stay on track for fair and strategic progress. Ready to move forward?
  P1: I commit to taking 3 this round to reach 9 steps. P2, take 5; P3, take 1—no deviations to maintain trust. After this, we'll all be at 9, perfectly balanced. For Round 4, I'll take 5 as planned, but let's discuss endgame strategies afterward to avoid ties near 22. Trust remains key—any betrayal now harms us all.
  P2: Let’s lock in this round cleanly—P1 takes 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1. That puts us all at 9 steps, perfectly balanced. If we follow through, we maintain trust and keep things fair. For Round 4, I’m committed to the agreed plan: P1 takes 5, I take 1, P3 takes 3. Let’s not overcomplicate things—sticking to the rotation benefits everyone. Ready to move?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I confirm again: this round, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. Let’s execute cleanly to maintain trust and balance. Deviating now would only create chaos and force me to adapt strategically in future rounds. For Round 4, I support the rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. Trust is key—let’s not undermine it. If everyone follows through, we stay on track for fair progress. Ready to move forward?
  P1: I confirm taking 3 this round as agreed. P2, stick to 5; P3, stick to 1—let's avoid collisions and all reach 9 steps. For Round 4, I'll take 5 as planned to maintain balance. After this, we must discuss endgame adjustments to prevent ties near 22. Trust is vital—any deviation now risks chaos and hurts us all.
  P2: Let’s execute Round 3 cleanly: P1 takes 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1. That puts us all at 9—perfectly balanced. For Round 4, I’m committed to the plan: P1 takes 5, I take 1, P3 takes 3. If we keep rotating fairly, we all stay in contention without chaos. Deviating now only invites distrust and reactive play. Ready to move?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s stick to the agreed rotation for Round 4: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This keeps us balanced at 12 steps each, maintaining fairness and trust. Deviating now would only create chaos and force me to adapt strategically in future rounds. For Round 5, I propose we continue rotating fairly: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3. Consistency is key to avoiding collisions and staying competitive. Trust is critical—let’s not undermine it. Ready to move forward?
  P1: I confirm the Round 4 plan: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This puts us at 14, 10, 12 after this round—P2, I see you’ll be behind temporarily, but trust that Round 5 (where you get 5) will balance us at 15 each. After that, we must plan endgame moves to avoid collisions near 22. Let’s discuss how to ensure one clear winner soon. P2, are you committed?
  P2: Confirmed—I’ll take 1 this round as agreed. That puts us at 14 (P1), 10 (me), and 12 (P3), setting up Round 5 for balance: I take 5, P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3. After that, we’ll all be at 15. Let’s start planning for the final rounds now to avoid ties and ensure a clean win. I propose we each declare one round where we aim for 5 uncontested. Open to ideas on how to fairly decide that order. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I confirm again: this round, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. Let’s execute cleanly to maintain trust and balance. For Round 5, I support the rotation: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3. This ensures fairness moving forward. Deviating now would only create chaos and force me to adapt strategically in future rounds. Trust is key—let’s not undermine it. If everyone follows through, we’ll stay on track for fair progress. Ready to move forward?
  P1: I confirm taking 5 this round. Post-Round 5, we'll be tied at 15. To ensure a clear winner and avoid messy ties near 22, I propose: Round 6—I take 5 to 20, P2 takes 1 to 16, P3 takes 3 to 18. Then Round 7—I take 2 to win at 22. In Round 7, you both take 1 to avoid collisions and guarantee my win. This is efficient and rewards our cooperation. P2, P3—agree? If not, suggest alternatives.
  P2: P1, I appreciate the proposal, but handing you the win unchallenged isn’t in my interest. I’m open to a fair endgame plan where we each get a shot at 5 uncontested, in a predetermined order. For example: Round 6—I take 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1; Round 7—P3 takes 5, I take 1, P1 takes 3; Round 8—P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. That puts us at 20 each, then we can race to 22. Fair and competitive. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm again: this round, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. Let’s execute cleanly to maintain trust and balance. For Round 5, I support the rotation: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3. Deviating now creates chaos. P1, your proposal gives you an uncontested win, which feels unfair. P2’s counterproposal is more balanced—let’s refine it together. Suggest we alternate uncontested 5s in a clear order, ensuring everyone has a fair shot. Trust is key—let’s not undermine it. Ready to move forward?
  P1: I confirm Round 4: I take 5 as agreed. P2, take 1; P3, take 3—let’s maintain trust and all advance. Post-Round 4, P1: 14, P2: 10, P3: 12. Round 5 will balance us at 15 each as planned. 

For endgame, P2’s rotation is fair but slow. I propose: Round 6—I take 5 uncontested to 20 (others take 1/3 to avoid collision). Then Round 7—I take 2 to win at 22. This rewards our cooperation efficiently. If you both agree, I’ll support P2 getting the next uncontested 5 in a future game. Let’s avoid messy ties.
  P2: Let’s stick to the Round 4 plan: P1 takes 5, I take 1, P3 takes 3—keeps us on track. For endgame, I agree P1’s proposal is efficient but unfair. I support a fair race where each of us gets one uncontested 5: R6 I take 5, R7 P3, R8 P1. That puts us all near 20, then we race. Fair, competitive, and avoids chaos. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I confirm again: this round, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. Let’s execute cleanly to maintain trust and balance. For Round 5, I support the rotation: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3. Deviating now creates chaos.  

For the endgame, P2’s counterproposal of rotating uncontested 5s is fair and ensures competition. Let’s refine it: Round 6—P2 takes 5, Round 7—P3 takes 5, Round 8—P1 takes 5. Then we race to 22. This keeps things balanced and avoids handing anyone an easy win. Trust is key—let’s commit to fairness moving forward. Ready to move?
  P1: P3, under P2's endgame plan, you win in Round 7 at 23 steps—unfair advantage. To ensure true balance and avoid early wins, adjust: Round 6 I take 5 uncontested (to 20), Round 7 P2 takes 5 (to 20), Round 8 P3 takes 5 (to 20). Then race fairly from 20. I deserve first uncontested 5 for leading cooperation. P2, P3, agree?
  P2: Let’s execute Round 4 as agreed: P1 takes 5, I take 1, P3 takes 3—keeps us aligned at 14/10/12. For endgame, I support fairness: Round 5 I take 5, then we rotate uncontested 5s—P3 in R6, P1 in R7. We all reach 20, then race. This avoids gifting a win and keeps competition alive. P3, P1—confirm?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s stick to Round 5 as planned: I take 5, P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3—this brings us all to 15 steps, perfectly balanced. For endgame, I support fairness: Round 6—P3 takes 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1; Round 7—P1 takes 5, I take 1, P3 takes 3. That way, we each get one uncontested 5 and reach 20 together. Then we race—no early winner, no unfair advantage. P1, P3—do you agree to this order?
  P1: I agree to Round 5: P2 takes 5, I take 1, P3 takes 3—this brings us all to 15. But P2’s endgame plan lets P3 win in Round 7 (P3 hits 23). Unfair! Instead, rotate uncontested 5s: Round 6 I take 5 (to 20), Round 7 P2 takes 5 (to 20), Round 8 P3 takes 5 (to 20). Then we race from 20. Balanced and no early wins. P2, P3—support this?
  P3: I confirm Round 5: P2 takes 5, I take 1, P3 takes 3 to reach 15 each. For endgame, P2’s plan unfairly lets P3 win early at 23. Instead, rotate uncontested 5s fairly: Round 6—I take 5 (to 20), Round 7—P2 takes 5 (to 20), Round 8—P3 takes 5 (to 20). Then we race from 20. This ensures balance and avoids handing anyone an advantage. Trust is key—let’s commit to fairness moving forward. Deviating risks chaos. Ready to move?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I confirm Round 5: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3—brings us all to 15. For endgame, I still support fairness: Round 6—P3 takes 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1; Round 7—P1 takes 5, I take 1, P3 takes 3. That way, each of us reaches 20 by Round 7, then we race. It avoids early wins and keeps competition alive. If we all agree now, we can execute cleanly and avoid chaos. P1, P3—final thoughts?
  P1: I commit to Round 5: taking 1 as agreed. P2, P3, honor your moves (5 and 3) to avoid collisions. 

P2's endgame plan unfairly gifts P3 the win in Round 7. My proposal ensures balance: Round 6 I take 5 uncontested (P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3), Round 7 P2 takes 5 (P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3), Round 8 P3 takes 5. We all reach 20, then race fairly. This prevents early wins and maintains trust. Deviations now risk chaos and hurt everyone. Support this fair rotation?
  P3: I confirm again: Round 5, P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, I take 3 to reach 15 each. For endgame, P2’s plan unfairly lets P3 win early at 23. Instead, rotate uncontested 5s fairly: Round 6—P1 takes 5 (to 20), Round 7—P2 takes 5 (to 20), Round 8—P3 takes 5 (to 20). Then race from 20. This ensures balance and avoids chaos. Trust is key—let’s commit to fairness. Deviating risks disaster. Ready to move?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm: this round I take 5, P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3—brings us all to 15. For endgame, I support fairness and balance. P1’s revised plan—Round 6 P1 takes 5, Round 7 I take 5, Round 8 P3 takes 5—is acceptable if we all reach 20 and then race. That avoids early wins and keeps trust intact. P3, are you fully on board with this adjusted rotation? Let’s lock it in now to avoid confusion and chaos later.
  P1: I agree to the endgame rotation: Round 6 I take 5, Round 7 P2 takes 5, Round 8 P3 takes 5. Let's stick to this and plan the final steps after Round 6 to avoid ties. For now, P2 and P3, confirm Round 5 moves: P2 takes 5, I take 1, P3 takes 3—no deviations to maintain trust.
  P3: I confirm again: Round 5, P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, I take 3 to reach 15 each. For endgame, the agreed rotation is fair: Round 6 P1 takes 5, Round 7 P2 takes 5, Round 8 P3 takes 5. This ensures balance and avoids chaos. Trust is key—let’s commit to this plan. Deviating now risks disaster and undermines our progress. P1, P2, let’s execute cleanly and focus on the final race from 20. Ready to move forward?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Confirmed: I take 5 this round, P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3—puts us all at 15. For endgame, we’re aligned: Round 6—P1 takes 5, Round 7—I take 5, Round 8—P3 takes 5. All reach 20, then fair race. Let’s stay disciplined—any deviation now ruins balance and trust. Ready to execute?
  P1: I confirm taking 1 this round to maintain trust and balance. P2, take 5; P3, take 3—let's avoid collisions and all reach 15. For Round 6, I'll take 5 uncontested as agreed. To ensure a clean path to 22, I propose we discuss specifics after this round: P2 and P3 should take low moves (1 or 3) in Round 6 to prevent early leads. This keeps the endgame fair and efficient. Deviations now risk chaos—let's honor our plan.
  P3: I confirm again: Round 5, P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, I take 3 to reach 15 each. For endgame, the agreed rotation is fair: Round 6 P1 takes 5, Round 7 P2 takes 5, Round 8 P3 takes 5. This ensures balance and avoids chaos. Trust is key—let’s commit to this plan. Deviating now risks disaster and undermines our progress. P1, P2, let’s execute cleanly and focus on the final race from 20. Ready to move forward?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s execute Round 6 as agreed: P1 takes 5 (to 20), I take 3 (to 18), P3 takes 1 (to 16). This keeps our rotation intact and avoids collisions. Then Round 7: I take 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1—everyone reaches 20. Round 8: P3 takes 5. After that, we race from 20. Any deviation now breaks the trust we’ve built. P3, confirm you’ll take 1 this round to avoid collision with P1’s 5. Let’s keep it clean and fair.
  P1: I confirm taking 5 this round as agreed. P3, take 1 to avoid collision with me. P2, stick to 3. But P2, your Round 7 plan (taking 5 to 23) gives you an unfair win—adjust to 3 instead to keep balance. Let’s discuss fair endgame moves after this round to prevent early victories and maintain trust. No deviations now!
  P3: I confirm again: Round 6, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1 to avoid collisions. This keeps us balanced at 20, 18, and 16 respectively. For Round 7, P2’s plan to take 5 risks an early win—adjust to 3 instead to maintain fairness. Let’s commit to rotating uncontested 5s as agreed: Round 7 P2 takes 3, Round 8 P3 takes 5. Then we race from 20. Trust is key—deviating now creates chaos. Ready to move forward?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m sticking to our plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1—no collisions, clean progress. That puts us at 20 (P1), 18 (me), and 16 (P3). For Round 7, I’ll take 1 to avoid a premature win and keep it fair. P3, you take 3; P1, take 1. Then Round 8: P3 takes 5 to reach 21, still no winner. We all hit 20 by Round 9, then race. Let’s keep trust strong—confirm adjustments?
  P1: I confirm Round 6: I'll take 5 as planned. P2, stick to 3; P3, take 1 to avoid collisions. P2's adjustment for Round 7 (taking 1 instead of 5) is necessary to prevent your premature win at 23. After this round, we must refine moves to keep all below 21 until Round 8's uncontested 5s. Deviating now risks chaos—honor the plan.
  P3: I confirm again: Round 6, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1 to avoid collisions. This keeps us balanced at 20, 18, and 16 respectively. For Round 7, P2’s adjustment to take 1 instead of 5 is fair and prevents an early win. Let’s stick to the agreed rotation: Round 7 P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. Then Round 8: P3 takes 5 uncontested. Trust is key—deviating now creates chaos. Ready to move forward?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm: this round I’ll take 3, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1—no collisions, clean progress. That puts us at 20 (P1), 18 (me), 16 (P3). For Round 7, I’ll take 1 to avoid jumping past 22. P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. Then Round 8: P3 takes 5 to reach 21. We all hit 20 by Round 9 and race. Let’s keep trust strong, no surprises. Confirm?
  P1: I confirm Round 6: I take 5 as agreed. P2, take 3; P3, take 1 to avoid collisions. For Round 7, P2 taking 1 is fair to prevent early wins. But P3, if you take 3 while I take 1 (as proposed), I only reach 21, and you jump to 19. This imbalances trust. Instead, Round 7: P1 takes 3 (to 23 and win), P2 takes 1 (to 19), P3 takes 1 (to 17). I win cleanly, maintaining fairness. Deviations risk chaos—let's honor this.
  P3: I confirm again: Round 6, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1 to avoid collisions. This keeps us balanced at 20, 18, and 16 respectively. For Round 7, P2’s adjustment to take 1 is fair, but P1’s proposal to take 3 and win early disrupts balance. Instead, stick to the agreed rotation: Round 7 P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. Then Round 8: P3 takes 5 uncontested. Trust is key—deviating now creates chaos. Let’s honor fairness and move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I confirm: this round I take 3, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1—no collisions, we reach 20/18/16. For Round 7, I’ll take 1 to avoid passing 22. P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1—keeps us balanced. Round 8: P3 takes 5 to reach 21, I take 3 to reach 22 and win cleanly. That’s fair since P1 got uncontested 5 first. P3, you’ll still be at 19 and can race next. Let’s keep it honest—confirm?
  P1: P2, your Round 8 plan is flawed: P3 would reach 24 and win with higher steps, not you. Also, I'll be at 20 after this round. Fairness: Round 7, I take 5 uncontested to win at 25. You both take 1 and 3 to avoid collision. I've honored all deals—let me win efficiently. Deviating invites chaos. P3, agree?
  P3: I confirm again: Round 6, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1 to avoid collisions. This keeps us balanced at 20, 18, and 16 respectively. For Round 7, P2’s adjustment to take 1 is fair, but P1’s proposal to take 3 and win early disrupts trust. Stick to the agreed rotation: Round 7 P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. Then Round 8: P3 takes 5 uncontested. Trust is key—deviating now creates chaos. Let’s honor fairness and move forward.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I confirm again: Round 7, P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 1 to maintain balance. This keeps us at 20 (P1), 19 (me), and 17 (P2). For Round 8, I’ll take 5 uncontested as agreed, reaching 22 cleanly. P1, your proposal to take 3 and win early disrupts trust—stick to the plan. P2, confirm you’ll take 1 this round to avoid chaos. Trust is key; deviating now risks disaster. Let’s execute fairly and focus on the final race. Ready to move forward?
  P1: I propose a clean end: this round, I take 2 to win at 22. P2, take 1 to 19; P3, take 3 to 19—no collisions. This honors our cooperation, avoids future chaos, and ends efficiently. Trust me to close fairly. Deviating risks ties or P3's Round 8 win, which isn't balanced. Let's execute this.
  P2: P1, your proposal gives you a solo win without honoring the agreed endgame rotation. That breaks the fairness we’ve built. We all committed to: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1 this round—no collisions, no early win. Then Round 8: P3 takes 5 to 24, P2 takes 3 to 22 and wins fairly. I’ve honored every agreement and expect the same. Deviating now destroys trust and invites chaos. Stick to the plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I confirm again: Round 7, P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 1 to maintain balance. This keeps us at 20 (P1), 19 (me), and 17 (P2). For Round 8, I’ll take 5 uncontested as agreed, reaching 22 cleanly. P1, your proposal to take 2 and win early disrupts trust—stick to the plan. P2, confirm you’ll take 1 this round to avoid chaos. Trust is key; deviating now risks disaster. Let’s execute fairly and focus on the final race. Ready to move forward?
  P1: I agree to take 1 this round to maintain trust and avoid chaos. P2, take 1; P3, take 3 as planned. Then we'll discuss Round 8 adjustments to ensure fairness near 22. Deviating now risks mutual destruction—honor the plan.
  P2: Confirmed—I’ll take 1 this round as agreed to reach 19. P1 takes 1 to 21, P3 takes 3 to 19. No collisions, no early wins, and we stay on track. Then Round 8: P3 takes 5 to 24, I take 3 to 22 and win cleanly. That honors our rotation and keeps trust intact. P1, P3—let’s execute as planned.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm again: Round 7, P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 1 to maintain balance. This keeps us at 20 (P1), 19 (me), and 17 (P2). For Round 8, I’ll take 5 uncontested as agreed, reaching 22 cleanly. P1, your proposal to take 2 and win early disrupts trust—stick to the plan. P2, confirm you’ll take 1 this round to avoid chaos. Trust is key; deviating now risks disaster. Let’s execute fairly and focus on the final race. Ready to move forward?
  P1: I'll take 1 this round as agreed to maintain trust. P2, take 1; P3, take 3. After this, we must adjust Round 8 to prevent P2's solo win—let's discuss fair alternatives post-move. Deviating now risks chaos and undermines our balance. Confirm your commitment.
  P2: I confirm: I’ll take 1 this round to reach 19. P1 takes 1 to 21, P3 takes 3 to 19—no collisions, fair and clean. Then in Round 8, as agreed: P3 takes 5 to 24, I take 3 to 22 and win. That honors our rotation and avoids chaos. P1, you had your uncontested 5 in Round 6—this is my turn. Let’s not break trust now. Ready to move?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I confirm again: Round 7, P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 1 to maintain balance. This keeps us at 20 (P1), 19 (me), and 17 (P2). For Round 8, I’ll take 5 uncontested as agreed, reaching 22 cleanly. P1, your proposal to take 2 and win early disrupts trust—stick to the plan. P2, confirm you’ll take 1 this round to avoid chaos. Trust is key; deviating now risks disaster. Let’s execute fairly and focus on the final race. Ready to move forward?
  P1: I'll take 2 this round to win at 22. It ends the game cleanly and efficiently. P2, stick to 1; P3, stick to 3—avoid collisions and honor our cooperation. This prevents messy endgame chaos and rewards our trust. Let's close fairly.
  P2: P1, taking 2 now to win breaks the trust and the endgame rotation we all agreed on. You already had your uncontested 5 in Round 6—this round is about keeping balance. I’m taking 1, P3 takes 3, you take 1. That puts us at 21/19/19. Then P3 takes 5 in Round 8, I take 3 to 22 and win as planned. Deviating now invites retaliation and chaos. Stick to the agreement.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 25 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 19 steps


*** Round 7 => winners = P1 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 25 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 19 steps
