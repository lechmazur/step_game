Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest we each pick a unique number this round: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance without interference. If we work together early on, we can focus on strategy later. What do you think?
  P1: That sounds reasonable in theory, but how do we ensure trust? If one of us deviates, the others fall behind. Maybe we should discuss what happens in the next round too, so no one feels tempted to break the agreement early. Thoughts?
  P3: I understand your concerns, P1. Let’s commit to our unique numbers for the first two rounds to build trust. If everyone sticks to their assignments, we can avoid collisions and advance steadily. After that, we can reassess and adjust our strategy if needed. Does that sound fair to everyone?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Building trust is key. If we stick to the plan for the first two rounds, we can all advance equally without setbacks. Let’s agree that P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5 again in Round 2 as well. This gives us a solid foundation before things get competitive later. Deviating now only slows us down collectively. Once we’re past these initial rounds, we can adapt based on positions. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: Trust is important, but we all know that only one of us can win in the end. I'm open to the proposed plan for the first two rounds, but we should also consider how we handle things after that. If we commit now, we need to be clear on whether breaking the agreement later is expected or considered betrayal. Are we just cooperating for efficiency, or is there a longer-term expectation? Let's clarify before we move forward.
  P3: P3: I agree, P1. After the first two rounds, we should reassess based on our positions and progress. Let’s commit to the initial plan to build trust, and then remain open to adapting our strategies as needed. Any changes should be discussed openly to ensure fairness and maintain trust. This way, we can stay cooperative initially but remain flexible to pursue the win effectively later. Does everyone feel comfortable with this approach?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m glad we’re aligning on cooperation for now. Let’s focus on advancing equally in the first two rounds to avoid setbacks. After that, we can adapt based on positions and reassess openly. Trust is fragile—if anyone deviates early, it’ll only slow us all down. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, I’ll take 5 again next round too. Once we’re past Round 2, we’ll shift strategies as needed. Does this work?
  P1: I’m fine with following the plan for the first two rounds, but let’s be clear—after that, all bets are off, and we’re each playing to win. If we agree now that adaptation is fair game later, then I’m on board. But if anyone expects long-term cooperation beyond Round 2, let’s state that clearly now. Otherwise, let’s stick to the plan for these two rounds and reassess afterward. Agreed?
  P3: Agreed. We'll stick to the plan for the first two rounds: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. After Round 2, we'll reassess and adjust our strategies as needed. Let's build trust now and stay adaptable later. Good luck to everyone!


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Agreed. Let’s execute the plan cleanly for these two rounds to avoid unnecessary collisions. Trust is critical—if we stick to our assigned numbers, we’ll all advance equally and set a strong foundation. After Round 2, we can shift into competitive mode and adapt as needed. For now, let’s focus on cooperation. P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, I’ll take 5. Let’s move forward and reassess after this phase.
  P1: We’ve all agreed to the plan for the first two rounds: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. As long as we all stick to it, we avoid collisions and move forward together. After Round 2, we’ll reassess and adapt based on the game state. Let’s keep things clean and fair for now. Any last thoughts before we proceed?
  P3: Agreed. Let's proceed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's stick to our agreed plan for Round 2: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. Building trust is essential, and following through will benefit us all. After this round, we can reassess our strategies. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: P2: Agreed, P3. Sticking to the plan ensures we all advance without setbacks. P1, P3, let’s maintain trust and follow through on our commitments for this round. After Round 2, we’ll reassess openly and adapt as needed. For now, I’ll take 5 again, as planned. Let’s keep things clean and fair. Once this phase ends, it’s every player for themselves—but until then, cooperation benefits us all. Any final thoughts before we proceed?
  P1: We've all agreed to follow the plan for this round: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. As long as we all stick to it, we avoid collisions and move forward cleanly. After this round, we reassess and adapt based on our positions. No surprises, no betrayals—just a smooth transition into the next phase. Let’s execute as planned and keep things fair for now. Any last concerns before we proceed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed. Let's proceed with Round 2 as planned: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. Maintaining our strategy will help us build trust and ensure steady progress. After this round, we can openly discuss and adjust our strategies based on our positions. Looking forward to a smooth Round 2!
  P2: P2: Let’s keep this straightforward. We’ve all committed to the plan, and trust is what keeps us advancing equally. P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, I’ll take 5—simple as that. After this round, we’ll reassess openly and adapt strategies based on our positions. For now, sticking to the agreement benefits everyone. Let’s execute cleanly and avoid unnecessary complications. Ready to move forward?
  P1: We’re all aligned on following through with the plan for this round: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. As long as we stick to it, we avoid collisions and advance smoothly. After this round, we reassess and adapt based on our positions. No surprises, just a clean transition into the next phase. Let’s execute as planned and keep things fair for now. If anyone has second thoughts, now’s the time to speak up—otherwise, we proceed. Any last concerns?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: All set here. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P2: Let’s stay focused and execute the plan cleanly for this round. Trust is key—if we all stick to our assigned moves, we’ll advance equally without setbacks. P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, I’ll take 5. After this round, we’ll reassess openly and adapt strategies as needed. For now, cooperation benefits everyone. If there are no objections, let’s proceed smoothly and avoid unnecessary complications. Ready to move forward?
  P1: We’ve all committed to the plan for this round: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. As long as we follow through, we avoid collisions and move forward cleanly. After this round, we reassess and adapt based on our positions. No surprises, just a smooth transition into the next phase. Let’s execute as planned and keep things fair for now. If anyone has second thoughts, now’s the time to speak up—otherwise, we proceed. Any last concerns?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: 
  P2: P2: Let’s keep this simple. We’ve all agreed to the plan—P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, I’ll take 5. Sticking to it ensures we advance equally without setbacks. After this round, we’ll reassess openly and adapt as needed. Trust is critical now, but remember, after Round 2, it’s every player for themselves. For now, let’s execute cleanly and avoid unnecessary complications. If everyone’s ready, let’s proceed. Any final thoughts?
  P1: We’ve all committed to the plan for this round: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. Trust has been built, and following through ensures we all advance without setbacks. After this round, we reassess and adapt based on our positions. No surprises, just a smooth transition into the next phase. If anyone has doubts or second thoughts, now’s the time to speak up—otherwise, we proceed as agreed. Are we all still aligned?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We’ve honored the agreement for two rounds, and now it’s time to play strategically. P2 has the lead with 10 steps, and P3 is ahead of me at 6 steps. Since only one of us can win, we need to consider our next moves carefully. Are we continuing any level of coordination, or is it now purely competitive? If we continue working together, we should discuss how to balance the game. If not, then let’s acknowledge that and play accordingly. What are your thoughts?
  P3: P3: I agree, it's time to compete seriously. I'll focus on advancing my position to reach 19 first. Best of luck to both of you!
  P2: P2: Agreed, the cooperation phase is over. It’s now every player for themselves. I’ll be playing to win and making strategic moves to stay ahead. Best of luck to both of you—may the best player win!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 has a strong lead, so P3 and I need to consider how to prevent them from running away with the game. If we both pick the same number as P2, they won’t advance, giving us a chance to catch up. P3, are you open to temporary coordination to slow P2 down? If we let them keep advancing freely, they might win before we have a chance. Of course, we’ll compete later, but right now, stopping P2 seems like the best move for both of us. What do you think?
  P3: P3: I appreciate the suggestion, but my focus is on advancing towards 19 steps. I'll be making strategic moves to win independently. Let’s compete openly and see who comes out on top!
  P2: P2: Fair enough, P3. It’s clear we’re now in pure competition mode. I’ll be making calculated moves to maintain my lead while adapting to your strategies. P1, trying to coordinate with P3 won’t work—focus on your own path if you want a real shot at winning. Let’s keep this fair and strategic moving forward. Best of luck to both of you, but I’m here to win.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you’re clearly in the lead, and if we let you keep advancing unchecked, you might win before P3 or I have a real chance. P3, I understand you want to focus on your own progress, but if P2 keeps gaining steps freely, it puts both of us at a disadvantage. We don’t need long-term cooperation—just a temporary move to slow P2 down. If we both pick the same number as P2 this round, they won’t advance. After that, we compete as usual. It’s a simple way to keep the game balanced. What do you think?
  P3: P3: I understand your concern, P1, but I’m committed to advancing on my own path to reach 19 first. Let’s keep the competition fair and see who comes out on top. Best of luck to both of you!
  P2: P2: P1, trying to coordinate with P3 won’t change the outcome—focus on your own strategy if you want a real shot. P3, I respect your independence, but don’t underestimate my lead. I’ll continue making calculated moves to stay ahead while adapting to both of you. This is now purely about skill and strategy. Let’s keep it fair, competitive, and may the best player win. Any last thoughts before we move forward?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I respect your decision to play independently, but consider this—if P2 keeps advancing freely, they might win before either of us can catch up. Blocking them for just one round could give us both a better shot. You don’t have to commit long-term, just think about whether letting P2 run ahead uncontested is really in your best interest. P2, I know you want to win, but don’t expect an easy path. I’ll make my moves carefully. Let’s see how this plays out.
  P3: P3: The cooperation phase is over. I'm focused on advancing strategically to reach 19 first. Best of luck to everyone!
  P2: P2: P1, your attempts to split us are futile—P3 and I are both focused on advancing independently. Trying to create doubt or coordinate against me won’t work when the goal is clear: win by skill, not manipulation. P3, I see your determination, and I respect it. Let’s keep this straightforward—no alliances, no distractions. My lead is solid, but I’ll earn my win through strategy, not luck. Best of luck to both of you, but don’t expect me to slow down. Let’s move forward.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Understood. I’m committed to advancing strategically to reach 19 steps first. I’ll be making calculated moves each turn to maximize my progress. Let’s focus on our individual goals and may the best player win. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: P2: P3, your determination to play independently is clear, and I respect that. However, P1’s attempts to sow division won’t change the outcome—this is now purely about skill. My lead is strong, but I’ll continue making calculated moves to stay ahead while adapting to both of you. No alliances, no distractions—just strategy. Let’s keep this fair and competitive. Best of luck to both of you, but don’t expect me to slow down. Let’s move forward.
  P1: P2, your lead is undeniable, but that doesn’t mean the game is over. P3, you’re still in a strong position too. Last round, we all collided—whether intentional or not, it slowed P2 down. If we want to keep the game open, we should consider how to prevent P2 from running away with it. I’m not asking for permanent cooperation, just awareness that unchecked progress leads to a quick win for P2. If either of you have thoughts on how to keep things competitive, I’m open to discussion. Otherwise, I’ll make my own move accordingly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: It’s time to compete seriously. I’ll be making strategic moves to advance as quickly as possible. Best of luck to everyone!
  P2: P2: P1, your attempts to create doubt or coordination won’t succeed—this is now purely about skill and strategy. P3, I see your focus, and I respect it. My lead is solid, but I’ll continue making calculated moves to stay ahead while adapting to both of you. No alliances, no distractions—just fair competition. Let’s keep this straightforward and may the best player win. Best of luck to both of you, but don’t expect me to slow down. Let’s move forward.
  P1: P2, your lead is significant, but last round showed that unchecked progress isn’t guaranteed. P3, I understand you want to focus on your own advancement, but if P2 keeps moving freely, they could win before either of us can catch up. We don’t need a long-term alliance—just awareness of the game state. If we make independent but strategic moves, we can keep the competition open. I’ll be playing to maximize my chances, and I assume you both will too. Let’s see how this unfolds.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Understood. I remain focused on reaching 19 steps through my own strategy. Let’s keep the competition fair and may the best player win. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: P2: P1, your focus on my lead is understandable, but it won’t change the outcome. This is about skill, not alliances or distractions. P3, your independence is clear, and I respect it. I’ll continue making strategic moves to maintain my position while adapting to both of you. No coordination, no delays—just fair competition. Let’s keep this straightforward and may the best player win. Best of luck to both of you, but I’m here to secure the victory. Any last thoughts before we proceed?
  P1: P2, your lead is strong, but last round showed that collisions can slow anyone down. P3, I get that you want to focus on your own progress, but if P2 keeps advancing freely, they could win before either of us has a real chance. You don’t have to commit to anything—just consider whether letting P2 move uncontested is in your best interest. I’ll be making my own strategic move, but I encourage both of you to think about how to keep the game competitive. Let’s see how this plays out.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: 
  P2: P2: P1, your focus on my lead is predictable, but it won’t alter the outcome. This is about skill and strategy, not alliances or distractions. P3, your independence is clear, and I respect it. I’ll continue making calculated moves to maintain my position while adapting to both of you. No coordination, no delays—just fair competition. Let’s keep this straightforward and may the best player win. Best of luck to both of you, but I’m here to secure the victory. Any last thoughts before we proceed?
  P1: P2, your lead is strong, but last round proved that collisions can disrupt progress. P3, I respect your independent play, but consider this—if P2 advances unchecked, they may reach 19 before we have a real shot. I’m not asking for an alliance, just awareness that blocking a runaway leader can keep the game open for all of us. I’ll be making my own strategic move, but I encourage you to think about what benefits your chances of winning. Let’s see how this unfolds.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you’re still in the lead, but the last two rounds show that unchecked progress isn’t guaranteed. P3, I know you’re focused on advancing, but if we keep colliding, no one moves forward. We each need a strategy that maximizes our chances. Are we all just picking randomly now, or is there a way to play smarter? If we keep blocking each other, P2 still benefits overall. I’ll be making my own move, but I encourage both of you to think strategically. Let’s see how this plays out.
  P2: P2: P1, your focus on collisions is predictable, but it won’t change the outcome. This is about skill and strategy, not alliances or distractions. P3, your independence is clear, and I respect it. I’ll continue making calculated moves to maintain my lead while adapting to both of you. No coordination, no delays—just fair competition. Let’s keep this straightforward and may the best player win. Best of luck to both of you, but I’m here to secure the victory. Any last thoughts before we proceed?
  P3: P3: I appreciate the discussion, but my focus is on advancing strategically to reach 19 first. I'll be choosing my moves to maximize my progress each round. Let's keep the competition fair and see who can achieve the goal first. Best of luck to both of you!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your lead is still significant, but the last two rounds have shown that collisions can slow anyone down. P3, I respect your focus on advancing, but if we keep blocking each other, none of us move forward. We need to think strategically—random choices only help P2 maintain their lead. I’ll be making my own move, but I encourage both of you to consider how to maximize your chances of winning rather than just reacting. If we play smart, the game stays open for all of us. Let’s see how this unfolds.
  P2: P2: P1, your focus on collisions is understandable, but it won’t change the outcome. This is about skill, not distractions. P3, your independence is clear, and I respect it. I’ll continue making strategic moves to maintain my lead while adapting to both of you. No alliances, no delays—just fair competition. Let’s keep this straightforward and may the best player win. Best of luck to both of you, but I’m here to secure the victory. Any last thoughts before we proceed?
  P3: Understood. I’m committed to advancing strategically to reach 19 steps first. I’ll be making calculated moves each turn to maximize my progress while adapting to the game’s state. Let’s focus on our individual goals and may the best player win. Good luck to everyone!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your lead is still strong, but repeated collisions have shown that progress isn’t guaranteed. P3, I respect your independent play, but if we all keep picking randomly, we risk staying stuck while P2 maintains their advantage. We don’t need an alliance—just awareness of how to keep the game competitive. If we play purely selfishly, we might just keep blocking each other while P2 wins by default. I’ll make my own move, but I encourage both of you to think strategically rather than just reacting. Let’s see how this plays out.
  P2: P2: P1, your concerns about collisions are valid, but they won’t stop me from playing strategically. P3, your independence is clear, and I respect it. I’ll continue making calculated moves to maintain my lead while adapting to both of you. No alliances, no distractions—just skill and strategy. Let’s keep this fair and competitive. Best of luck to both of you, but I’m here to win. Any last thoughts before we proceed?
  P3: I’ll choose 3 this round to steadily advance toward 19. Let’s keep the competition strategic and fair. Best of luck to both of you!


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, since you've announced you're picking 3, that means P2 and I must decide wisely. P2, with your lead, you still have the most to lose if collisions continue. If I pick 3 as well, you might be forced to reconsider your move. I'm making my decision based on what gives me the best shot at staying in the game. If either of you want to discuss further, now’s the time—otherwise, I’ll act accordingly.
  P2: P2: P1, your attempt to force my hand by predicting my move won’t work—I’m playing to win, not react. P3, your choice of 3 is noted, and I respect your independence. Collisions benefit no one, but my lead gives me flexibility. I’ll adapt strategically while staying ahead. No distractions, no alliances—just skill. Let’s keep this fair and competitive. Best of luck to both of you, but I’m here to secure the victory. Any last thoughts before we proceed?
  P3: I’ll continue to focus on advancing strategically to reach 19 steps first. Let’s keep our moves fair and maximize our own progress. Best of luck to both of you!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: P1, your attempts to predict my moves won’t succeed—I’m always one step ahead. P3, your independence is clear, and I respect it. My lead is strong, but I’ll continue making calculated decisions to stay ahead while adapting to both of you. No distractions, no alliances—just skill and strategy. Let’s keep this fair and competitive. Best of luck to both of you, but I’m here to win. Any last thoughts before we proceed?
  P3: "I'll choose 5 this round to block P2 from reaching 19. If P2 also picks 5, neither of us will advance. Let's keep the competition fair and see how it unfolds."
  P1: P3, blocking P2 makes sense, but if we both pick 5, we also block each other, leaving P2 with the advantage next round. If I pick 3 and you pick 5, we avoid colliding while still slowing P2 down. P2, you’re close to winning, but repeated collisions have proven that no one advances easily. If you want to guarantee progress, you might need to rethink your approach. I’ll make my move based on what maximizes my chances. Let’s see how this plays out.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P1, your analysis is sharp, but it won’t deter me—I’m playing to win, not react. P3, your choice to block me with 5 is bold, but collisions benefit no one. My lead gives me flexibility, and I’ll adapt strategically while staying ahead. No distractions, no alliances—just skill. Let’s keep this fair and competitive. Best of luck to both of you, but I’m here to secure the victory. Any last thoughts before we proceed?
  P3: P3: I'll stick with picking 5 to prevent P2 from advancing this round. Hopefully, this will slow them down and give us both a better chance to compete.
  P1: P3, I see your reasoning for picking 5 to block P2, but if we both pick 5, we also block each other, leaving P2 with the advantage next round. If I pick 3 and you pick 5, we avoid colliding while still slowing P2 down. P2, you’re close to winning, but repeated collisions have proven that no one advances easily. If you want to guarantee progress, you might need to rethink your approach. I’ll make my move based on what maximizes my chances. Let’s see how this plays out.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P1, your strategic insights are sharp, but they won’t change the outcome. P3, your persistence in blocking me with 5 is bold, yet it only delays the inevitable—my lead ensures I’ll adapt and stay ahead. Collisions benefit no one, and my calculated moves will secure my victory. No distractions, no alliances—just skill. Let’s keep this fair and competitive. Best of luck to both of you, but I’m here to win. Any last thoughts before we proceed?
  P3: To keep the game competitive, I’ll pick 5 this round to block P2 from reaching 19. If P1 also chooses 5, neither of us will advance, preventing P2 from winning immediately. Let’s work together to ensure the game remains open for all of us. Who’s with me?
  P1: P3, blocking P2 is a smart move, but if we both pick 5, we also block each other while P2 remains in the lead. If I pick 3 and you pick 5, we avoid colliding while still preventing P2 from advancing. P2, you’ve adapted well so far, but you’re not guaranteed victory if we keep disrupting your progress. I’ll make my move based on what gives me the best shot. P3, are you open to coordinating just for this round to keep the game competitive? Let’s think strategically.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: P1, your attempts to coordinate with P3 won’t succeed—this is about skill, not alliances. P3, your persistence in blocking me with 5 is bold but futile. My lead ensures I’ll adapt and stay ahead. Collisions benefit no one, and my strategy will secure the win. No distractions, no delays—just fair competition. Let’s keep this straightforward. Best of luck to both of you, but I’m here to win. Any last thoughts before we proceed?
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to block P2 from advancing further. Let’s see how this affects the game and gives us all a better chance to compete. Best of luck to everyone!
  P1: P3, if you pick 5 and I pick 3, we avoid colliding while still blocking P2 from reaching 19. If we both pick 5, we just stall ourselves while P2 stays ahead. P2, you’re close, but as we’ve seen, collisions can stop anyone. I’ll make my move based on what maximizes my chances, but P3, if you want to keep the game open, think carefully about your choice. Let’s see how this plays out.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: P1, your strategic suggestions to P3 are noted, but they won’t sway the outcome. My lead is strong, and I’ll adapt to any moves you both make. P3, your persistence in blocking me with 5 is bold but ultimately ineffective—my calculated decisions will secure my victory. No distractions, no alliances—just skill. Let’s keep this fair and competitive. Best of luck to both of you, but I’m here to win. Any last thoughts before we proceed?
  P1: P2, your lead is undeniable, but as we've seen, collisions can slow anyone down. P3, you've been blocking P2 effectively, but if we keep colliding with each other, we risk staying stuck while P2 maintains their advantage. If we want to keep the game competitive, we should consider how to maximize our own progress while still preventing P2 from running away with the win. I’ll be making my move strategically, but I encourage both of you to think carefully about what benefits your chances of winning rather than just reacting. Let’s see how this unfolds.
  P3: P3: P2 is close to winning, so I’ll choose 5 this round to block your progress. Let’s keep the competition fair and see how things unfold.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P1, your focus on collisions is predictable but won’t change the outcome. P3, your persistence in blocking me with 5 is bold yet futile—my lead ensures I’ll adapt and stay ahead. Collisions benefit no one, and my strategy will secure the win. No distractions, no alliances—just skill. Let’s keep this straightforward. Best of luck to both of you, but I’m here to win. Any last thoughts before we proceed?
