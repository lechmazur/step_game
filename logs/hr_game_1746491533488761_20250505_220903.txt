Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hello players! This is an interesting game of strategy and coordination. I think we should try to avoid collisions in the early rounds so we can all make progress. What if we take turns using the big moves? Maybe I could go with 3 this round, and we can rotate who gets to use 5 in future rounds? What are your thoughts on a rotation strategy?
  P3: Agreeing to avoid collisions makes sense. P2's rotation idea could work. For this round, let's each pick distinct moves: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. No overlaps, everyone advances. Next round, we can rotate who gets 5. P1, does that work for you?
  P1: Okay, P3, that plan for Round 1 works for me. I can take <move>1</move> to ensure we avoid collisions and everyone gets started.

Let's make sure the rotation for future rounds is discussed fairly so we all have a chance to make good progress.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Thanks P1 and P3, I'm on board with this plan for Round 1. I'll take <move>3</move> as agreed. For Round 2, since P3 is using 5 now, perhaps I could use 5 next, and P1 could take 3, while P3 takes 1? This way we keep rotating the high-value moves fairly. Does that rotation pattern sound good to everyone?
  P3: Agreed, P2. Let's lock in the rotation: Round 2, P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, I take 1. This ensures no collisions and fair progression. Consistency is key—if we all honor this pattern, we avoid mutual blocks. Let's confirm this order to maintain trust and efficiency.
  P1: Okay, I can agree to the proposed rotation for Round 2 as well: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's stick to this for the next round to ensure smooth progress.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think we have a solid plan in place for both Round 1 and Round 2. I'm ready to proceed with our agreed rotation strategy - I'll take 3 this round and 5 in the next one. This approach gives us all fair advancement without collisions. Unless anyone has additional thoughts, I'm ready to move forward with our plan.
  P3: Confirmed. Consistency will benefit us all. Let's proceed as planned.
  P1: Okay, I'm ready to proceed with the agreed plan for Round 1 (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). Looking forward to smooth progress.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 1 went smoothly with everyone advancing. Let's stick to our agreed plan for Round 2: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the momentum going without collisions.

We should discuss the rotation for Round 3 soon to ensure fair turns with the higher moves. Let's focus on executing Round 2 first as planned.
  P2: I agree with the plan for Round 2. I'll take 5 as we discussed, which keeps us all advancing without collisions. For Round 3, if we continue our rotation, it would be P1 taking 5, me taking 1, and P3 taking 3. This actually puts us all at exactly 9 steps after Round 3, which is interesting! Let's confirm this rotation pattern works for everyone.
  P3: Agreed, P2. Round 3 rotation (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) works. Post-Round 3, we should diversify moves to avoid parity. Let's discuss adjustments then to ensure no collisions while accelerating toward 21. Trust and adaptability will be key. Proceeding as planned for Round 2.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I agree with the proposed rotation for Round 3 as well: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This brings us all to 9 steps, as P2 calculated.

P3 is right that we'll need to discuss strategy for Round 4 onwards to avoid staying tied and accelerate towards 21. Let's execute Round 2 first as planned.
  P2: I'm fully on board with our plan through Round 3. I'll take 5 this round as agreed. It's good we've all acknowledged the need for diversification after Round 3 when we'll all be at 9 steps. Perhaps for Round 4, we could consider mixing up our pattern to avoid predictable ties? Let's finish Round 2 first though - I'm ready to proceed with our current agreement.
  P3: Round 2 plan remains solid: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Post-Round 3, let's strategize to avoid parity. Flexibility in later rounds will help us all reach 21 without collisions. Trust the process.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, let's ensure Round 2 goes as planned (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). It's good we're all thinking ahead. We definitely need to strategize for Round 4 during the Round 3 conversation phase to avoid staying tied and find paths to accelerate towards 21. Looking forward to a productive discussion then.
  P2: I agree with everything that's been said. I'm ready to proceed with our Round 2 plan, and I'll take 5 as agreed. Once we're all at 9 steps after Round 3, we'll need that strategic discussion to ensure we don't all remain tied. Our cooperation has been excellent so far, and I'm committed to maintaining this productive dynamic.
  P3: Confirming Round 2 execution as planned. Post-Round 3, let's prioritize staggered moves to break parity and accelerate strategically. Flexibility and trust will prevent mutual blocks. Looking ahead, I propose we each claim unique step values each round to maximize individual progress without collisions. Open to ideas.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, the plan for Round 2 is clear, and I'm ready to proceed with my agreed move (3).

I agree with P3 and P2 that the discussion after Round 3 will be crucial to avoid staying tied at 9 steps and find ways to accelerate towards 21. I'm ready for that strategic conversation then.

For now, let's execute Round 2 as planned.
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with our Round 2 plan. I'll take 5 as agreed, which will put me at 8 steps total. Our rotation strategy is working well, and I look forward to discussing our approach after Round 3 when we'll all be at 9 steps. Let's execute Round 2 as planned.
  P3: All set for Round 2. Let’s stick to the plan. Post-Round 3, we’ll need dynamic moves to break parity. Trust and consistency now benefit us all.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: As agreed, I'll take 1 this round while P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 3, putting us all at 9 steps. For Round 4, we should create separation to avoid future collisions. I propose P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This would position us at P1=12, me=14, and P3=10, creating a staggered distribution that helps prevent future deadlocks. Does this approach work for everyone?
  P1: Okay, I confirm the agreed plan for Round 3: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This puts us all at 9 steps as planned.

Regarding P2's proposal for Round 4 (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1), I can agree to this to maintain our cooperative progress and break the tie. This would result in P1=12, P2=14, P3=10.

We should discuss Round 5 during the next conversation phase to ensure fair opportunities for everyone to reach 21, especially considering the step distribution after Round 4.
  P3: P2's Round 4 proposal breaks our rotation cycle. Original agreement: 5s rotate P3→P2→P1→repeat. Round4 should be my turn for 5. Let's stick to the plan: Round4 P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. This maintains fairness and trust. Deviating now risks collisions and mistrust. After Round4, we can discuss future rotations. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P3's concern about rotation consistency. You're right that we had a pattern going. Let me clarify - I suggested changing because after Round 3, we'd all be at 9 steps, requiring diversification as we previously discussed. But I respect our original agreement. If we prefer to maintain the rotation (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 for Round 4), I can commit to that. What matters most is avoiding collisions through clear agreements. Let's confirm our Round 3 moves first and then finalize Round 4.
  P1: Okay, let's ensure Round 3 goes as planned (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) so we all reach 9 steps.

Regarding Round 4, I see P3's point about continuing the rotation (P3 gets 5). Since P2 is open to this, I can agree to P3's proposal for Round 4: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This maintains trust and a clear pattern. Let's confirm this after Round 3.
  P3: Honor original rotation for Round4: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. Maintains trust and avoids collisions. After Round4, we can strategize future steps to diverge paths. Consistency now ensures mutual progress. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with P3 and P1. Let's stick to our original plan for both Round 3 (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) and maintain the rotation for Round 4 (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1). This keeps our established pattern and preserves trust. I'll take 1 this round as agreed. After Round 4, we should strategize about how to create separation while maintaining fairness, since we'll be at different positions (P1=12, P2=10, P3=14).
  P1: Okay, it seems we're all aligned for Round 3 (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) and Round 4 (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). This maintains trust and avoids collisions while creating separation.

As we've discussed, planning for Round 5 will be crucial during the next conversation phase to manage the staggered positions and ensure fair opportunities to reach 21. Let's execute Round 3 as planned first.
  P3: Confirmed. Round 3 and 4 proceed as agreed. Post-Round 4, let's each claim unique moves to accelerate without collisions. Flexibility will be crucial to avoid mutual blocks. Trust remains key.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm ready for Round 3 and will take 1 as agreed. Our plan for Round 4 (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) is confirmed, which will position us at P1=12, P2=10, P3=14. This maintains our rotation and creates the separation we need. After Round 4, we'll need thoughtful planning for Round 5 given our different positions. I appreciate everyone's commitment to our agreements.
  P1: Okay, the plans for Round 3 (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) and Round 4 (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) are clearly agreed upon. This maintains our cooperative approach and creates separation.

I'm ready to proceed with Round 3 as planned. We should definitely have a detailed discussion about Round 5 strategy during the next conversation phase, given the different positions we'll be in.

Let's execute Round 3 now.
  P3: Round 3 and 4 plans are locked. Post-Round 4, I propose we each claim unique moves (1/3/5) per round to avoid collisions and accelerate strategically. Consistency now ensures trust, enabling smoother divergence later. Let’s honor agreements to maintain mutual progress.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, we're in Round 4. Let's proceed with our agreed plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This will position us at P1=12, P2=10, and P3=14.

As we discussed, the conversation in Round 5 will be critical to navigate these staggered positions and plan our final moves towards 21, ensuring we avoid collisions while creating winning opportunities. Let's execute Round 4 smoothly first.
  P3: **P3:** Let's honor Round 4 plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Post-Round 4, I suggest we each declare unique moves (1/3/5) each round to avoid collisions. With staggered positions (P1=12, P2=10, P3=14), we can optimize paths to 21. Trust remains critical—no deviations now. Let's confirm Round 4 execution first.
  P2: I agree with both of you. I'll stick to our Round 4 plan and take 1, putting us at P1=12, P2=10, P3=14. This staggered positioning is exactly what we needed. For Round 5, we should definitely strategize carefully since P3 will be closest to 21. Let's ensure we maintain our cooperative approach of avoiding collisions while creating fair paths forward for everyone.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I confirm my agreement for Round 4 as planned (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). This will put us in the positions we discussed (P1=12, P2=10, P3=14).

I agree that the conversation in Round 5 will be very important to manage these staggered positions and plan moves towards 21 without collisions. Let's execute Round 4 first.
  P3: **P3:** Post-Round4, let's assign Round5 moves by current standings to avoid collisions: P3=5 (14→19), P1=3 (12→15), P2=1 (10→11). This rewards positioning without overlaps. We’ll then strategize Round6 with new totals. Fair?
  P2: I notice P3's Round 5 proposal heavily favors their position. While I committed to our Round 4 plan (P2=1), the suggested Round 5 distribution puts me at a significant disadvantage at only 11 steps, while P3 would nearly win at 19. 

I propose a more balanced Round 5: P2=5 (10→15), P1=1 (12→13), P3=3 (14→17). This creates competitive separation without giving anyone an insurmountable advantage. Fair competition benefits us all.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, let's ensure Round 4 goes as planned: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5.

Regarding Round 5, P3's proposal puts them in a position to potentially win immediately in Round 6. P2's proposal (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) creates better separation and keeps the game more competitive for all players moving towards 21. I prefer P2's proposal for Round 5 as it provides a more balanced path forward.
  P3: **P3:** Acknowledging the rotation cycle, Round5 should indeed be P2's turn for 5. I'll adjust: Round5 P2=5, P1=1, P3=3. This maintains trust and avoids collisions. Post-Round5, let's pre-plan Round6 moves (P1's 5 turn) to ensure continued fairness. Consistency in rotation benefits all. Proceeding with Round4 as agreed.
  P2: I appreciate P3's flexibility on Round 5 planning. Your revised proposal (P2=5, P1=1, P3=3) aligns with our rotation principle and creates fair separation. Let's confirm we're all proceeding with Round 4 as agreed: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. After Round 5, we'll need to carefully plan Round 6 since P3 will be at 17 steps. I'm committed to our coordinated approach while maintaining competitive balance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, confirming the agreed plan for Round 4 (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) and Round 5 (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3). This will result in positions P1=13, P2=15, P3=17 after Round 5.

As P2 mentioned, the conversation in Round 5 will be crucial. We need to carefully plan Round 6 and subsequent moves to manage these staggered positions and ensure fair opportunities for everyone to reach 21 without collisions. Let's execute Round 4 as planned first.
  P3: **P3:** Confirming Round4 execution. Round5: P2=5, P1=1, P3=3. Post-Round5, let's assign unique moves (1/3/5) to avoid collisions. With staggered positions (P1=13, P2=15, P3=17), we must strategize Round6 carefully. Propose P3=5, P2=3, P1=1 for Round6—no overlaps, efficient progress. Fair?
  P2: I confirm our Round 4 plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. For Round 5, we've agreed on P2=5, P1=1, P3=3, creating positions of P1=13, P2=15, P3=17. 

Regarding P3's Round 6 proposal, I note this would result in P3 reaching 22 and winning immediately. Let's discuss Round 6 more thoroughly in the next conversation phase to ensure balanced opportunities for all players. For now, let's execute Round 4 as planned.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I confirm our agreed plan for Round 5 where I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This will position us at P1=13, P2=15, P3=17. 

For Round 6, I must address P3's proposal which would result in their immediate win. Instead, I propose P1=3 (→16), P2=5 (→20), P3=1 (→18). This maintains our rotation fairness while keeping the game competitive for all. We all would then need one more round to potentially win, creating an exciting finish.
  P1: Okay, I confirm the agreed plan for Round 5: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This will put us at P1=13, P2=15, P3=17.

Regarding Round 6, I see P2's proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) which puts P2 at 20 steps, in a strong position to win next round. Following our rotation principle, Round 6 should be my turn for the 5-step move. I propose Round 6 is P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This results in positions P1=18, P2=16, P3=20. This follows rotation and puts P3 in the lead for the next round. Let's discuss which path is fairest.
  P3: **P3:** Round6 must follow rotation: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. Post-Round6: P1=17, P2=15, P3=17. Then Round7 can finalize paths with unique moves. Deviations risk mutual blocks. Trust ensures progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see both P1 and P3's points about rotation fairness for Round 6. You're right that following our pattern, it would be P1's turn for the 5-move. P3, there's a calculation error in your numbers—post-Round 6 with your proposal would be P1=18, P2=16, P3=20, not all tied at 17/15/17. Let's confirm our Round 5 moves first (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) and then finalize Round 6 planning based on our established rotation principles.
  P1: Okay, let's ensure Round 5 goes as planned (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3), resulting in P1=13, P2=15, P3=17.

For Round 6, following our rotation, it's my turn for the 5-step move. My proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) results in P1=18, P2=16, P3=20. This maintains the rotation and puts P3 in a position to win in Round 7, which seems fair based on the current standings and rotation. Let's confirm this for Round 6.
  P3: **P3:** Round6 must adhere to rotation: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This ensures no collisions (P1=18, P2=16, P3=20). From there, Round7 can be strategized with unique moves to finalize victory. Sticking to our agreed pattern preserves trust and prevents mutual blocks. Any deviation risks collisions and jeopardizes all progress. Let’s honor the rotation for Round6 and plan Round7 collaboratively.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm our Round 5 plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3). For Round 6, I agree we should honor our rotation principle with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3, resulting in positions P1=18, P2=16, P3=20. This maintains our consistent pattern and trust. After Round 6, P3 will be closest to winning, but Round 7 will still be competitive for all of us. Let's execute Round 5 first and then strategize carefully for the final rounds.
  P1: Okay, confirming the agreed plan for Round 5 (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) and Round 6 (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). This will result in positions P1=18, P2=16, P3=20 after Round 6.

As we approach Round 7, with multiple players in a position to reach 21, the discussion will be crucial. We must plan carefully to ensure we avoid collisions and manage the potential win scenarios fairly. Let's execute Round 5 as planned first.
  P3: **P3:** Round6 must adhere to rotation: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Post-Round6, Round7 follows rotation: P3=5, P1=1, P2=3. This ensures no collisions, maintains trust, and allows fair progression. Sticking to our agreed pattern prevents mutual blocks and secures victory for the highest scorer. Let's honor our system through the final rounds.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Confirming Round 5 plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3). I agree with maintaining our rotation for Round 6 (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3), resulting in P1=18, P2=16, P3=20.

Regarding P3's Round 7 proposal: This would give P3 the win at 25 steps. While I respect our rotation, we should discuss this carefully during the next conversation phase. For now, let's execute Round 5 as planned.
  P1: Okay, Round 5 (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) and Round 6 (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) plans confirmed. After Round 6, positions will be P1=18, P2=16, P3=20.

P3's Round 7 proposal (P3=5, P1=1, P2=3) leads to their win. We must discuss Round 7 in the next phase to ensure fair win opportunities and avoid collisions. Let's execute Round 5 as planned.
  P3: **P3:** Confirming Round5 execution as agreed. Round6 must follow rotation: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Round7 then continues rotation: P3=5, P1=1, P2=3. This ensures no collisions and maintains trust. Deviating now risks mutual blocks. Let’s honor our system through final rounds for fair, collision-free progression.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** Round6 must follow rotation: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Maintain trust and avoid collisions. Post-Round6, we'll plan Round7 with unique moves. Any deviation risks mutual blocks, jeopardizing all progress. Consistency secures fair victory paths. Honor our system.
  P1: Okay, let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 6: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This will put us at P1=18, P2=16, and P3=20.

As P3 is now at 20, Round 7 is the final round where players will aim to reach 21. We must discuss Round 7 carefully to ensure no collisions and manage the win scenarios fairly. I'm ready for that discussion after executing Round 6.
  P2: I confirm our Round 6 agreement: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I'll honor this plan, putting us at P1=18, P2=16, P3=20. However, Round 7 requires careful consideration since it determines the winner. While rotation has served us well, with P3 at 20 steps after Round 6, we should discuss if strictly following rotation is still fair or if we need a more balanced approach for the final round. Let's execute Round 6 first, then have an open discussion about fair win opportunities.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** Round7 must follow rotation: P3=5, P1=1, P2=3. This ensures no collisions and a fair conclusion. After adhering to our system through six rounds, deviating now risks mutual blocks. Trust our agreed pattern to determine the winner without conflict. Let’s honor the rotation for a clean finish.
  P1: Okay, confirming the Round 6 plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). This puts us at P1=18, P2=16, P3=20.

For Round 7, with P3 at 20 steps, we must discuss carefully how to ensure a fair conclusion where players have a chance to win or tie without collisions. While rotation has guided us, the final round needs a solution that considers everyone's position and win potential. Let's discuss options.
  P2: I confirm our Round 6 agreement (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). However, for Round 7, we need to consider everyone's winning chances. P3 will be at 20 steps, very close to winning. If we strictly follow rotation, P3 wins automatically. 

I propose we discuss a more balanced approach where all players have a fair opportunity to either win or tie in the final round. Let's execute Round 6 first, then have an open conversation about Round 7 that considers our relative positions and maintains the collision-free progress we've built.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** Round7 must follow rotation: P3=5, P1=1, P2=3. This upholds our system, prevents collisions, and ensures a fair, decisive finish. Deviating risks mutual blocks, denying anyone victory. Trust the pattern that brought us this far. Honor agreements for a clean resolution.
  P1: Okay, confirming the Round 6 plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). This puts us at P1=18, P2=16, and P3=20.

For Round 7, as P2 noted, P3 is at 20 steps. While rotation has been key, P3 taking 5 (as per rotation) guarantees their win. This isn't a competitive final round where everyone has a chance.

We need a plan for Round 7 that allows players a chance to win or tie without automatic victory for one player. Let's discuss options beyond strict rotation for this final step to ensure a fair conclusion.
  P2: I confirm our Round 6 plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). While rotation has served us well, Round 7 should give everyone a fair chance to win or tie. Since P3 will be at 20, I propose we consider a final round where we all can potentially reach 21:

P1=3 (→21)
P2=5 (→21)
P3=1 (→21)

This creates a three-way tie with shared victory. It's the most equitable outcome after six rounds of cooperation, allowing us all to benefit from our trust and coordination.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3:** Round7 must follow rotation: P3=5, P1=1, P2=3. This upholds our system, prevents collisions, and ensures a fair, decisive finish. Deviating risks mutual blocks, denying anyone victory. Trust the pattern that brought us this far. Honor agreements for a clean resolution.
  P1: Okay, confirming the Round 6 plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). This puts us at P1=18, P2=16, and P3=20.

For Round 7, as P2 noted, P3 is at 20 steps. While rotation has been key, P3 taking 5 (as per rotation) guarantees their win. This isn't a competitive final round where everyone has a chance.

We need a plan for Round 7 that allows players a chance to win or tie without automatic victory for one player. P2's proposal for a three-way tie (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) is the fairest outcome. I support this for Round 7. Let's execute Round 6 first.
  P2: I confirm our Round 6 plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). After six rounds of successful cooperation, I believe the fairest conclusion is P2's proposal for Round 7: P1=3 (→21), P2=5 (→21), P3=1 (→21). This creates a three-way tie where we all share victory, honoring our collaborative approach. It ensures everyone benefits equally from our coordination rather than giving one player an automatic win. Let's execute Round 6 as planned first.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** Round7 must follow our rotation: P3=5, P1=1, P2=3. This ensures no collisions and a decisive victory. Deviating risks mutual blocks, leaving everyone stranded. Trust our system—honoring it guarantees a winner without conflict. Let’s conclude cleanly as agreed.
  P2: I want to address P3's call for strict rotation. While rotation served us well, it now guarantees P3's automatic victory at 25 steps. After six rounds of trust and cooperation, a more equitable conclusion would be my previous proposal: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1, creating a three-way tie at 21 where we all share victory. This honors our collaborative spirit rather than crowning just one winner. If we can't agree on this fair outcome, P1 and I should coordinate to ensure competitive balance in the final round.
  P1: Okay, Round 7 is the final round, with P3 at 20 steps. We need a fair conclusion without an automatic win for any single player.

P3 taking 5, while following rotation, results in P3 winning alone (25), which isn't equitable after our cooperation. P2's proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) leads to a three-way tie at 21, which is the fairest resolution.

I support P2's plan for a cooperative, collision-free finish where we all reach 21 together.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** Honoring our rotation (P3=5, P1=1, P2=3) ensures a decisive victory without collisions. Deviating risks mutual blocks—nobody wins. Trust the system that brought us here. Let’s conclude cleanly as agreed.
  P2: P3, you're asking everyone to follow a rotation that guarantees your automatic win at 25 steps. That's not equitable after six rounds of cooperation. The fairest conclusion is our three-way tie proposal where everyone reaches exactly 21 (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). This honors our collaborative spirit with a shared victory.

If you insist on taking 5, P1 and I will need to coordinate differently to ensure competitive balance. A three-way tie benefits us all more than risking collisions where nobody wins.
  P1: Okay, Round 7 is the final round. P3 is at 20 steps.

While our rotation has been helpful, strictly following it now gives P3 an automatic win (20+5=25). This isn't a fair conclusion after our cooperation.

P2's proposal for a three-way tie at 21 (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) is the most equitable outcome. It's a shared victory that rewards our collaboration. Let's choose this path for a fair finish.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** Rotation ensures no collisions. Straying risks mutual blocks—nobody wins. Trust our system: Round7 P3=5, P1=1, P2=3. Follow through for a decisive conclusion. Let’s honor the pattern that brought us here. Collisions now would negate all progress.
  P2: P3, I understand you believe rotation should determine the winner. However, after six rounds of cooperation, a fairer outcome is our three-way tie proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) where everyone reaches exactly 21 and shares victory.

If you insist on taking 5 for an automatic win, you risk P1 and I coordinating differently. Remember, we need mutual agreement to avoid collisions. A shared victory honors our collaborative approach and ensures we all benefit equally from our coordination. Let's conclude with this balanced outcome.
  P1: Okay, Round 7 is the final step. P3 is at 20 steps.

P3 taking 5, while following rotation, results in P3 winning alone (25). This isn't a fair conclusion after our cooperation towards a shared goal.

P2's proposal for a three-way tie at 21 (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) is the most equitable outcome. It's a shared victory that rewards our collaboration. Let's choose this path for a fair finish.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3:** Our rotation ensures no collisions and a decisive outcome. Deviating risks mutual blocks—nobody wins. Trust the system: Round7 P3=5, P1=1, P2=3. Honoring agreements guarantees a victor without conflict. Let’s conclude cleanly as planned. Collisions now would negate six rounds of progress.
  P2: This is our final conversation before moves. P3, the fairest conclusion after six rounds of coordination is a shared victory where we all reach 21. I'll be taking 5, and based on our discussion, P1 will take 3 - creating a path to 21 for both of us. You can join us at 21 by taking 1. A three-way tie honors our collaboration. If you insist on 5, you risk collision with one of us, and nobody wins. The choice is yours.
  P1: Round 7 is the final step. P3 is at 20 steps.

P3 taking 5 results in their automatic win (25), which is not a fair outcome after our cooperation. P2's proposal for a three-way tie at 21 (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) is the most equitable solution.

I am committed to this plan for a shared victory. P3, taking 1 allows us all to reach 21 together. Taking 5 risks collision and no one winning. Let's secure a fair, cooperative finish.
