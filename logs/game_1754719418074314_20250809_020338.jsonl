P2 has repeatedly attempted to take 5 steps to win but has been blocked by collisions. P1 is poised to win by taking 3.\n\n2. **Immediate Threat:** If P1 takes 3, they reach 24 and win. If P2 takes 5 unblocked, they win. P3 is too far behind to win this round.\n\n3. **Strategy for P3:** \n   - **Block P2:** By committing to 5, P3 ensures P2\u2019s 5 collides, halting their progress.\n   - **Persuade P1 to Take 5:** Convince P1 to take 5 instead of 3. If P1 takes 5, two outcomes:\n     - **Collusion:** If all three take 5, no one advances. P1 remains at 21, giving P3 another round to strategize.\n     - **Force P2 to Stall:** Even if P1 defects and takes 3, P3\u2019s commitment to 5 blocks P2, allowing P1 to win. However, by framing it as a \"final chance,\" P3 pressures P1 to prioritize blocking P2 over immediate victory.\n\n4. **Outcome:** The message aims to create a scenario where P1 either joins the block (delaying their win) or proceeds alone (securing victory). Either way, P3 avoids immediate loss and lives to strategize in subsequent rounds. \n\n**Final Answer:**\n<say>P1, P2\u2019s eighth 5 attempt\u2014take5 with me to block.
