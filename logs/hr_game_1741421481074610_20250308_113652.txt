Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all go with different numbers this round to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 take 1, P3 take 3, and I'll take 5.  What do you say?
  P1: P3, do you agree to this plan? Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions so we all advance. I’ll take 1 as P2 suggested.
  P3: Sounds good to me. I'll take 3.  Let's stick to this agreement so we all make progress.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, good. Just confirming - P1 goes 1, P3 goes 3, I go 5.  Let's stick to this for a smooth start.
  P1: P3, I trust your word. Let’s lock this in—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, you take 3. Collisions mean no progress, so **adhering strictly to this plan is critical**. No surprises?
  P3: Yes, no surprises. I'll take 3.

  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue coordinating.  I'll take 1 this round, P1 can take 5, and P2 can take 3. This keeps us moving forward smoothly.  Agree?
  P1: P3, I agree to your plan. Let’s confirm: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1. This avoids collisions and lets us all progress. P2, are you in? Strict adherence remains critical—no last-minute changes. Let’s secure forward momentum.
  P2: Sounds good to me. P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 3.  Let's keep this coordination going for efficient progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Excellent, glad we're on the same page.  Just to reiterate: P3 (me) takes 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3.  Let's keep this coordinated strategy going.
  P1: P2, P3—final alignment: P1 to 5, P2 to 3, P3 to 1. No last-minute shifts—collisions erase progress. P2, confirm? P3, you hold? Let’s lock this down. Advancement first, then strategy adjustments.
  P2: Yes, confirmed. P1 goes 5, P3 goes 1, I'll take 3.  Let's maintain this coordinated approach for now.

  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's keep the coordinated advancements going.  I propose P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This puts me at 13, a good leading position.  Agree?
  P3: Sounds reasonable.  P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5.  Confirming I will take 3. Let's stick to this.
  P1: P2, rotating fairly ensures we all progress equitably. Let’s adjust: P3 takes 5 (to 9), I take 3 (to 9), and you take 1 (to 9). This maintains coordination while sharing advancement opportunities. P3, does this work for you? Unity here strengthens our collective strategy.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your desire for equal progress, but strategically, maintaining a slight lead benefits us all. A frontrunner can later adjust strategy to ensure a shared win if necessary.  Let's proceed with the original plan for this round.  P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, I take 5.  Then we can discuss adjustments for future rounds.
  P3: P1, I appreciate the sentiment of shared progress, but I agree with P2 that a staggered advance can be strategically beneficial.  Let's stick with the original plan for this round.  I'll take 3.  We can revisit a more equitable distribution in the next round if needed.  P1 - 1, P2 - 5, P3 - 3.  Confirm?
  P1: P2, P3—agreed. Let’s execute the original plan for consistency: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5. Coordination is key to avoid setbacks. Let’s confirm final alignment before moving. No changes from this agreement?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Confirmed. No changes.  P1 - 1, P2 - 5, P3 - 3. Let's move to the next phase.
  P3: Confirmed. No changes. P1 - 1, P2 - 5, P3 - 3.
  P1: P2, your plan creates a collision: P1 (6+1=7) and P3 (4+3=7) would both land on 7. Let’s fix this: **P1 takes 3 (→9), P3 takes 5 (→9), and P2 takes 1 (→9)**. We all reach 9 without collision. Equal progress ensures fairness and avoids setbacks. P3, P2—agree? This maintains coordination and prevents wasted moves.

  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s avoid collisions by choosing distinct numbers. I’ll take **5** (→12). P2, take **3** (→11). P3, take **1** (→5). This ensures all advance without overlap. Confirm this plan?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's secure a three-way tie. I'll take 3 (to 11). P1, you take 1 (to 8).  P3, you take 5 (to 9). Then next round, we each take a different number again, reaching a three-way tie at 14.  This guarantees a shared victory. What do you say?
  P3: P1 and P2, a tie isn't guaranteed and leaves us vulnerable.  I'm taking 5 this round to reach 9.  Let's focus on coordinated advancement, not premature tie attempts.  Propose P1 takes 1 (to 8) and P2 takes 3 (to 11).  This avoids collisions and keeps us moving.  Confirm?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3: Let's prioritize clear coordination to avoid prior errors. I propose my initial plan: **P1 takes 5 (→12), P2 takes 3 (→11), P3 takes 1 (→5)**. This keeps all moves distinct and advances me to a leading position. P3’s alternative leaves me stagnant at 8, but this path maximizes collective progress while positioning me to win next round. Confirm this plan?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's be strategic. A guaranteed win for one of us is better than a risky tie. I'm taking 3 to reach 11.  P1, take 1 (to 8). P3, take 5 (to 9).  This sets me up to win next round.  If I get close to 22 next round, I'll ensure one of you wins with me.  Trust me. This benefits us all more than a risky tie attempt.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the desire for a lead, but unpredictable moves jeopardize us all.  I'm taking 5 (to 9).  A tie isn't ideal, but neither is jeopardizing the entire game. I propose P1 takes 1 (to 8) and P2 takes 3 (to 11). This keeps us moving forward predictably.  Let's prioritize consistent progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s finalize the initial plan to avoid risks. **P1 takes 5 (→12), P2 takes 3 (→11), P3 takes 1 (→5)**. This keeps moves distinct and advances all safely. P2’s alternative risks overlap next round (e.g., if you take 5 from 11 to 16, then I’d need to collide). Stick to coordination—lead responsibly but fairly. Confirm?
  P2: P1 and P3, my proposed 3, 1, 5 split gets us to 11, 8, and 9 respectively.  This avoids collisions *and* sets up a clean path to a three-way tie at 14 next round. From there, we can easily coordinate a shared win.  This is the safest and most equitable path to victory for all of us. Let's lock this in.
  P3: P1 and P2, sticking to 5, 3, 1 (resulting in 9, 11, and 12) is the safest path.  A three-way tie *isn't* guaranteed next round and relies on us all cooperating perfectly *again*. Let's prioritize consistent, collision-free progress.  I'm taking 5.  Please confirm you'll take 3 and 1 respectively to avoid another collision.


Round 4, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm going for 5 this round to reach 13.  I urge you to take 1 and 3 respectively. This avoids collisions and positions us for a potential three-way tie at 14 next round.  Let's prioritize a shared win.  If I approach 22 in a later round, I'll adjust to ensure a joint victory. Trust me – a coordinated win is the best outcome for all of us.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's secure individual progress first, *then* discuss ties. I'm taking 1 (to 10).  P1, take 3 (to 10). P2, take 5 (to 13). This avoids collisions.  A tie at 14 isn't guaranteed – what if someone breaks the agreement?  Focus on safe moves now.  We can discuss shared wins when we're closer to the goal.
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s avoid collision by each taking different numbers. I’ll take 5 (to 12). P2, take 3 (to 11). P3, take 1 (to 10). This ensures all advance without overlap. Confirm this plan to prevent setbacks. No last-minute changes?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 5.  A shared win at 14 is the safest path. From 13, I can take 1 next round to reach 14. You both can then take 3 and 5 to join me at 14.  This guarantees a three-way tie.  Let's prioritize this shared victory.
  P3: P1 and P2, securing a three-way tie at 14 *isn't* guaranteed.  What if one of us deviates next round? Let's prioritize consistent individual progress. I'm taking 1 (to 10). P1, take 3 (to 10), P2, take 5 (to 13). This is the safest way to avoid collisions.  We can discuss shared wins *after* making safe moves this round.
  P1: P3, your plan causes a collision between P1 and P3 at 10. Let’s adjust: **P1 takes 5 (→12)**, P2 takes 3 (→11), and P3 takes 1 (→10). All moves distinct. Confirm this to avoid setbacks. No surprises—strict adherence ensures progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's avoid further collisions. I'm taking 5 (to 13).  P3, please take 1 (to 10). P1, take 3 (to 10). This is the cleanest path forward.  Let's secure these moves now, then discuss strategy for the next round.  Confirm?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm locking in 1 to reach 10.  Let's avoid collisions: P1 take 3 (to 10) and P2 take 5 (to 13). This ensures progress for all.  Focus on advancing safely *this* round.  We can discuss coordinating future moves *after* this round.  Confirm 3 and 5 to avoid another stalemate.
  P1: P3, your plan collides P1 and you at 10. **Stick to the safe split:** P1 takes 5 (→12), P2 takes 3 (→11), P3 takes 1 (→10). This avoids overlaps. Confirm NOW—no last-minute changes!


Round 5, Move phase:

  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s secure progress without collisions. I propose: **P1 takes 5 (→12)**, P2 takes **1 (→9)**, and P3 takes **3 (→13)**. This spreads our moves uniquely, ensuring all advance. P3, your 3 avoids my 5 and P2’s 1. P2, confirm you’ll take 1 to avoid overlapping with us? Let’s lock this in—strict adherence now guarantees forward momentum.
  P3: P2 and P1, my proposed 1, 3, 5 split (P2-1, P3-3, P1-5) gets us to 9, 13, and 12 respectively. This is the cleanest path forward *and* sets us up for a potential three-way tie at 14 next round. Let's lock this in.  If someone gets close to 22 in a later round, they can adjust to ensure a joint victory.  Trust me - a coordinated win is the best outcome.
  P2: P3, your proposed 1, 3, 5 split makes sense.  It positions us well for a potential three-way tie at 14 next round. Let's go with that: P2 takes 1 (to 9), P3 takes 3 (to 13), and P1 takes 5 (to 12).  Confirm?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3: I confirm the agreed plan—**P1 takes 5 (→12)**, **P2 takes 1 (→9)**, and **P3 takes 3 (→13)**. This avoids collisions and maintains progress. No surprises—strict adherence ensures advancement. Let’s proceed.
  P3: P2 and P1, let's stick with the agreed 1, 3, 5 split (P2-1, P3-3, P1-5). This gives us 9, 13, and 12 respectively.  A coordinated win is ideal, but *guaranteeing* a tie at 14 is impossible.  This plan ensures safe advancement *now*.  We can discuss tie strategies *after* this safe round.  Confirm?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's lock in the 1, 3, 5 split (P2-1, P3-3, P1-5) as discussed. This gets us to 9, 13, and 12 respectively, the cleanest path forward.  A coordinated win is the goal, but let's secure this step first.  Confirm?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: Final agreement—**P1 takes 5 (→12)**, **P2 takes 1 (→9)**, **P3 takes 3 (→13)**. No deviations—collisions erase progress. Stick strictly to this plan to advance safely.
  P3: P2 and P1, let's lock in the 1, 3, 5 split (P2-1, P3-3, P1-5) for a clean progression to 9, 13, and 12 respectively.  This sets us up well for future coordination. Confirm?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize the 1, 3, 5 split (P2-1, P3-3, P1-5) to reach 9, 13, and 12 respectively. This is the safest and most logical progression.  Confirming one last time before we move.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's lock in 1, 5, 3 for this round (P1-1, P2-5, P3-3). This gets us to 13, 14, and 16 respectively.  This maintains safe progression and sets me up for a potential win next round.  Confirm?
  P1: P3, your plan risks letting you surge ahead. Let’s balance progress: **P1 takes 5 (→17), P2 takes 1 (→10), P3 takes 3 (→16)**. This keeps moves distinct and advances all safely. A lead now gives me a clearer path to victory next round. P2, confirm you’ll take 1? P3, agree to 3?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's prioritize consistent progress and avoid giving anyone a runaway lead. I'm taking 1 (to 10). P1, take 3 (to 15), and P3, take 5 (to 18). This keeps the game balanced and prevents an early win.  Confirm?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, my proposed 1, 5, 3 split (P1-1, P2-5, P3-3) is the safest path. It gets us to 13, 14, and 16 respectively, preventing any single player from getting too far ahead.  Let's prioritize balanced advancement this round.  We can discuss win scenarios *after* this safe round.  Confirm 1 and 5 to avoid another stalemate.
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s block P3’s surge. My plan (P1-5 to 17, P2-1 to 10, P3-3 to 16) prevents P3 from gaining an insurmountable lead. Next round, I can secure 22 unopposed. P3’s proposal lets them leap to 16, risking an early solo win. P2, your 1 keeps us aligned against P3’s advance. Confirm this split—**strict adherence** ensures my lead while stifling P3’s path. No compromises now!
  P2: P1 and P3, focusing solely on blocking each other creates unnecessary complications. My initial proposal (P1 takes 1 to 13, P2 takes 5 to 14, P3 takes 3 to 16) offers the smoothest path forward.  This avoids collisions *and* positions us for a potential collaborative win later. Let's prioritize clean advancement this round and discuss win scenarios afterward.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm taking 3 (to 16).  A balanced game benefits us all.  P1, your aggressive 5 push creates an imbalance.  P2, your 1, 3, 5 split is ideal *after* this round. Let's prioritize safe, balanced progress NOW.  P1 - 1 (to 13), P2 - 5 (to 14). This avoids a runaway leader and keeps us aligned for future coordination. Confirm.
  P1: P2, P3: Final agreement—P1 takes **5** (→17), P2 takes **1** (→10), P3 takes **3** (→16). This avoids collisions and sets me up to win next round unopposed. P2, confirm your **1**? P3, stick to **3**. No last-minute shifts—strict adherence ensures progress.
  P2: P3, taking 3 gets you to 16.  I can then take 5 next round to reach 14, and you can win the following round with a 5 move to 21. This ensures a win for one of us and prevents P1 from running away with the game.  P1, taking 1 this round benefits us all long term. Let's secure this win.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, I'm taking 1 this round (to 17). You take 3 (to 20) which sets you up perfectly to win next round. P2, you take 5 (to 15). This ensures no collisions and guarantees a win for one of us.  Let's lock this in.  Confirm?
  P1: P2/P3: I can win this round by taking 5 to reach **22**. Let’s ensure no collision: I’ll take **5**, P2 takes **1**, P3 takes **3**. This secures my victory fairly without leaving room for ties. Confirm? No sense prolonging this.
  P2: P1, congratulations on your impending win.  I'll take 1 (to 11). P3, take 3 (to 19). This avoids collisions and lets us all end gracefully.  Let's finish this cleanly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, taking 5 this round secures your win. I'll take 3 (to 19), and P2 can take 1 (to 11).  This avoids collisions and lets us conclude the game efficiently. Let's confirm this plan for a smooth finish.
  P1: P2/P3: Final confirmation—**I’ll take 5 to reach 22 and win.** To ensure no collision: P2, please take **1** (→11), P3, take **3** (→19). This executes our agreed plan for a clean finish. No last-minute changes—stick to this to let me secure victory fairly.
  P2: P1, congratulations!  I'll take 1. P3, please take 3. Let's wrap this up cleanly as agreed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, congratulations!  I'll take 3 (to 19). P2, please take 1 (to 11). This allows P1 to win cleanly with 5. Let's finish this as planned.
  P1: P2/P3: Final reminder—collisions block *everyone*. I’ll take 5 to secure 22. P2, your 1 (→11) and P3’s 3 (→19) keep us all advancing. No last-minute shifts—let’s honor the plan. A fair win now beats risky ties later. Confirm?
  P2: P1, congratulations! I'll take 1. P3, please take 3.  Let's end this cleanly as planned and ensure everyone advances one last time.
