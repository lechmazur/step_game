Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s try to avoid collisions right from the start. I suggest we each pick a different number this round to ensure we all advance. I’m leaning towards one of the options, but I won’t say which yet. How about you two? Can we agree to spread out our choices for this first move? Let me know your thoughts.
  P2: I agree we should avoid collisions. I'm willing to coordinate, but we need to be careful about revealing too much. Maybe we can each hint at our preferred numbers without being too direct? I'm thinking of going with something moderate.
  P3: I agree that avoiding collisions is important. To keep things simple, I suggest we each pick different numbers. I’m considering going for 5, but I’m open to hearing your thoughts. Let’s make sure we all advance this round! What are your final thoughts on the numbers?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks for the input, P2 and P3. I’m glad we’re on the same page about avoiding collisions. Since P3 mentioned leaning towards 5, I’m considering a different number to ensure we spread out. How about you, P2? Can you hint at which number you’re leaning towards so we can avoid overlap? I want us all to advance this round. Let me know your thoughts, and I’m ready to finalize our plan.
  P2: Since P3 is hinting at 5 and P1 seems to be avoiding that, I'll consider taking 3 to help us spread out. That way we could potentially all advance without collision. Does that work for everyone?
  P3: I appreciate the willingness to coordinate, P1 and P2. Since P2 is leaning towards 3 and P1 is avoiding 5, I’ll stick with my initial thought of choosing 5 for this round. This way, we can all advance without colliding. If we stick to this plan, we should all make progress! Let’s finalize our choices and ensure we all move forward. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for working together on this. Since P3 is sticking with 5 and P2 is leaning towards 3, I’ll consider taking 1 to ensure we all pick different numbers and advance this round. I think this plan gives us the best chance to avoid collisions. If everyone is good with this, let’s stick to it. I’m ready to finalize.
  P2: I agree with the plan - P3 taking 5, me taking 3, and P1 taking 1. This gives us all a chance to advance. Let's stick to this arrangement.
  P3: I think we have a solid plan with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and me taking 5. If everyone is on board, I’m ready to finalize my choice. Let’s make sure we stick to our agreed numbers to avoid any collisions and all advance this round. Looking forward to seeing how this plays out! If everyone’s set, we can wrap up the conversation phase. What do you think?

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, great job avoiding collisions last round! Let’s keep the momentum going. Since we’re at different positions now, I suggest we again aim to pick different numbers to ensure we all advance. I’m considering a number that fits my strategy, but I’m open to input. P3, since you’re ahead, maybe you can hint at your choice first? P2, what are your thoughts? Let’s coordinate to avoid overlap and maximize our progress. Looking forward to hearing from you both!
  P2: Since P3 is in the lead at 5 steps and P1 is trailing at 1 step, we should be careful about our choices. I'm concerned about potential collisions if we're too predictable. While coordination worked well last round, we might need to be more strategic now. I'm keeping my options open but will try to avoid obvious moves. What are your thoughts on how to proceed this round?
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree that we should continue to avoid collisions. However, with P2's concern about predictability, we might need to adjust our strategies. Since I'm currently in the lead, I might consider a different number to keep things interesting. P1, what are you thinking? If you have a number in mind, let’s try to coordinate again to ensure we all advance. I look forward to hearing your thoughts!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, thanks for the input. I’m glad we’re all focused on avoiding collisions. P3, since you’re open to switching things up, I’ll hint that I’m considering a moderate move this round to balance my progress. P2, I understand the need to be less predictable, so let’s mix it up while still avoiding overlap. Can you hint at your direction? I want us all to advance again. Let’s finalize a loose plan if possible. I’m ready to adjust based on your thoughts.
  P2: Since P1 is hinting at a moderate move and P3 might switch things up from their previous 5, I'm considering going for a higher number this round to catch up with P3. Would that work with everyone's plans? Just want to make sure we don't end up colliding.
  P3: I appreciate the discussion so far, P1 and P2. Since P2 is considering a higher number to catch up and P1 is leaning towards a moderate move, I think I might choose 1 this round. This way, I can avoid collisions and give P1 a chance to advance as well. Let’s try to keep our choices varied to ensure we all make progress. What do you both think? If we can finalize our plan, I'm ready to wrap this up.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, thanks for the updates. P3, I’m fine with you taking 1 this round to mix things up. P2, since you’re aiming for a higher number, I’ll stick with my moderate choice to avoid overlap. I think this keeps our moves varied enough to prevent collisions. If we’re all set with this—P3 on 1, me on a moderate number, and P2 on a higher one—let’s finalize and move forward. I’m ready to wrap up the conversation.
  P2: I agree with the plan - I'll go for a higher number while P3 takes 1 and P1 goes moderate. This arrangement should help us all advance without collisions.
  P3: Thanks for the updates, P1 and P2. I think we have a solid plan with P3 taking 1, P1 going moderate, and P2 aiming for a higher number. To ensure we avoid collisions, I suggest P2 clarifies what "higher number" means for them. Once we finalize our choices, we can all advance smoothly this round. Let’s make sure we stick to our agreed numbers to maximize our progress! Looking forward to hearing P2's choice so we can wrap this up.

  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, it looks like we all made progress last round! For this round, I think we should continue to avoid collisions. P1, since you're currently at 4 steps and might want to catch up, I suggest you consider a moderate number again. P2, since you're ahead at 8 steps, maybe you can go for a higher number to maintain your lead. I’m leaning towards 1 again to keep things varied and avoid overlap. Let’s finalize our choices to ensure we all advance! What do you think?
  P2: Thanks P3, but since I'm in the lead now, I might actually consider a lower number this round to play it safe. With P1 likely wanting to catch up and you suggesting 1, I think spreading out our choices differently could work well. What are your thoughts on adjusting the plan?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’ve been avoiding collisions so far. P3, I appreciate the suggestion to go moderate, and P2, I understand your shift to a lower number to play it safe. To keep our moves varied, I’m considering a higher number this round to catch up. P3, if you’re sticking with 1, and P2 is going lower, this should help us spread out. Let’s finalize a plan to ensure we all advance. What do you both think? I’m ready to adjust if needed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the discussion so far. To avoid collisions, I’ll stick with my plan of choosing 1 again. P1, if you’re considering a higher number to catch up and P2 is thinking lower, this could work well for us. P2, what specific number are you leaning towards? Let’s finalize our choices to ensure we all advance this round without overlap. I’m looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
  P2: Since P3 is committed to 1 and P1 wants to go high, I'll clarify that I'm thinking of taking 3 this round. This should give us all room to advance without collisions. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, thanks for the updates. P3 sticking with 1 and P2 taking 3 sounds good for avoiding collisions. I’ll confirm I’m leaning towards 5 to catch up, which should keep our choices spread out. If we stick to this—P3 on 1, P2 on 3, and me on 5—I think we can all advance this round. Does this work for everyone? I’m ready to finalize if we’re all set. Let me know if any adjustments are needed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I believe we have a solid plan with me on 1, P2 on 3, and P1 on 5. This should allow us all to advance without any collisions. If everyone is comfortable with this arrangement, let’s finalize our choices and move forward. I’m excited to see how this round plays out! Please confirm if you’re all set, or let me know if any last-minute adjustments are needed.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, great job on the last round! For this round, I think we should continue to avoid collisions. P1, since you're at 9 steps and might want to catch up, I suggest you consider a higher number. P2, you're at 11 steps, so maybe you can go moderate to keep your lead. I’m thinking of going with 1 again to keep things varied. Let’s finalize our choices to ensure we all advance! What do you both think?
  P2: Since I'm in the lead at 11 steps, I need to be careful about my choice. P3's suggestion of me taking a moderate number could work, but I want to ensure we don't have any collisions. P1 might want to catch up aggressively since they're close behind. Let's coordinate our moves carefully this round. What specific numbers are you both considering?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s keep avoiding collisions this round. P3, I’m fine with you taking 1 again to mix things up. P2, since you’re leading and considering a moderate number, I’ll aim for a higher number to catch up. I think this spread—P3 on 1, P2 moderate, and me high—should work to ensure we all advance. P2, can you hint at your specific choice to confirm we don’t overlap? I’m ready to finalize if we’re all set. Let me know your thoughts!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the discussion so far. To avoid collisions, I’ll stick with my plan of choosing 1 again. P1, if you’re considering a higher number to catch up and P2 is thinking moderate, this should work well for us. P2, what specific number are you leaning towards? Let’s finalize our choices to ensure we all advance this round without overlap. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
  P2: Since P3 is committed to 1 and P1 wants to go high, I'll take 3 again to maintain a safe, moderate pace. This should give us all room to advance without collisions. Does this arrangement work for everyone?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, thanks for the updates. P3 sticking with 1 and P2 taking 3 sounds good for avoiding collisions. I’ll confirm I’m going with 5 to catch up, which should keep our choices spread out. If we stick to this—P3 on 1, P2 on 3, and me on 5—I think we can all advance again. Does this work for everyone? I’m ready to finalize if we’re all set. Let me know if any adjustments are needed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since P1 and I are tied at 14 steps, we need to be especially careful about collisions. P3, you're a bit behind at 8 steps, so you might want to make a bigger move. I suggest we coordinate differently this round to avoid any ties that could cost us the win. I'm open to discussing our moves, but we should be strategic given the current standings.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, with P2 and me tied at 14 steps, avoiding collisions is critical this round. P3, since you’re at 8, a bigger move could help you catch up. I’m considering a number that pushes me closer to the goal, but I want us all to advance. P2, can you hint at your direction to avoid overlap? P3, what are you thinking? Let’s coordinate to ensure no collisions. I’m open to adjusting based on your input. Looking forward to your thoughts!
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree that avoiding collisions is crucial this round, especially with you both tied at 14 steps. Since I'm at 8, I’m considering a bigger move to catch up.

P2, I’d like to hear your thoughts on how we can coordinate effectively. Let’s make sure we all advance this round! Looking forward to hearing your plans!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Since both P1 and I need to be careful at 14 steps, and P3 wants a bigger move to catch up, I'm thinking of taking a moderate number this round. This way, we can all advance without collisions. P1, what range are you considering? P3, feel free to go higher if you want to catch up.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, thanks for the input. P2, since you’re leaning moderate, and P3 is considering a bigger move, I’m thinking of aiming high to push towards the goal. Let’s keep our choices distinct—P3 high, P2 moderate, and me high as well, but I’ll adjust if needed to avoid overlap. P3, can you confirm your range? P2, does moderate mean 3 again? I want us all to advance, so let’s finalize this spread. I’m ready to proceed if we’re set. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the discussion so far. Since you're both at 14 steps, I understand the need to be strategic. I’m thinking of going for a higher number this round to catch up, but I want to ensure we avoid collisions. If P2 is leaning moderate, could you clarify if that’s 3 again? I’m open to adjusting my choice to help us all advance. Let’s finalize our plan and make sure we’re all set to move forward without overlap! Looking forward to your thoughts!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Since P1 and P3 are both hinting at higher numbers, I'll confirm I'm taking 3 to maintain a moderate pace. This should help us avoid collisions while still making progress. Let's finalize our moves and ensure we all advance this round.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since I'm in the lead at 17 steps, I need to be strategic about my next move. P1 is close behind at 14, and P3 had a collision last round trying to catch up. I suggest we try to avoid another collision this round. I'm open to coordinating our moves, but we should be careful about our choices given how close we are to the goal. What are your thoughts on how to proceed?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, with P2 at 17 and me at 14, this round is critical to avoid collisions and close the gap. P3, since you’re at 8, a bigger move could help you catch up.

Let’s coordinate effectively so we can all advance this round! Looking forward to your thoughts!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Since I'm close to winning at 17 steps, I'll take a moderate number like 3 to play it safe. P1 might want to go high to catch up, and P3 needs a big move after the collision. If we spread out our choices, we can all advance. Does this arrangement work for everyone?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, thanks for the input. P2, since you’re taking 3 to play it safe, I’ll aim for a higher number to catch up. P3, if you’re also going for a big move, let’s avoid overlap—can you confirm your choice? I think we can all advance with this spread if we’re clear. I’m ready to finalize to prevent collisions. Does this work for everyone? Let me know if adjustments are needed.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the discussion so far. Since P2 is taking a moderate number like 3, I need to make a significant move to catch up. I'm considering 5 for this round. P1, if you're also aiming high, we should confirm our choices to avoid collisions. Let’s finalize our plan quickly so we can all advance this round without issues. What specific number are you leaning towards, P1? I’m ready to proceed once we have clarity!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Since P3 has declared they want to take 5, and I'm committed to 3, P1 should consider taking 1 to ensure we all advance. This would give us the best spread and avoid any collisions. Let's finalize this arrangement - me on 3, P3 on 5, and P1 on 1. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate the effort to coordinate. P2, thanks for suggesting I take 1 to spread out our choices. I’m fine with going for 1 this round to ensure we all advance without collisions. P3, since you’re on 5, and P2 is on 3, this should work for everyone.

Let’s coordinate our choices carefully this round to maximize our chances! What are you both thinking?
  P2: Since I'm at 20 steps, I only need 2 steps to win. I'll be taking a small number this round to secure my victory. P1 is very close behind at 19, so they might go aggressive. P3, you're welcome to take a larger number since you're further back. Let's try to avoid any last-minute collisions that could cost us the win.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, this round is critical with P2 at 20 and me at 19. P2, since you’re aiming for a small number to win, I’ll consider a higher number to catch up or overtake. P3, if you’re going for a bigger move, let’s avoid overlap. I want us all to advance if possible, but I need to push forward. Can you both hint at your specific choices to prevent collisions? I’m ready to finalize our plan. Let me know your thoughts!
