Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I think it's best if we all choose different step sizes each turn to avoid collisions. That way, we can all make progress without hindering each other. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to choose different step sizes to avoid collisions. Let's coordinate our moves to ensure we all progress. P1, if you take 1, I'll take 3, and P2 can take 5. This way, we can all advance without any conflicts. What do you think, P2?
  P2: Sounds good to me.  I'll take 5 this round, then we can rotate.  So next round, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I take 3.  Then the round after that, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1.  We keep this rotation until the end.  Agree?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's proceed with P2's rotation plan but allow for adjustments in step choices if needed, provided that players communicate their intentions to avoid collisions. This way, we can coordinate effectively while also being flexible based on our positions.
  P3: I'm on board with the rotation plan, but let's keep an eye on our positions and adjust if someone gets close to 20 steps. If anyone feels the need to change their step size in a given round, just communicate it clearly so we can avoid collisions. Agreed?
  P2: Okay, sounds like we have a plan.  Just to confirm, this round I take 5, next round P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I take 3.  Following round, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1. Let's stick to this unless someone's close to winning.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree with the rotation plan. For this round, I'll take 1 step, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Let's confirm these choices before moving on to ensure there are no conflicts. If everyone is okay with this, we can proceed. If not, please speak up so we can adjust accordingly.
  P3: I confirm my choice of 3 steps for this round as per our agreed rotation plan. Let's keep monitoring our positions and communicate any necessary adjustments in future rounds to avoid collisions and ensure we all progress smoothly. Looking forward to seeing how this strategy unfolds.
  P2: Yes, I confirm. I'm taking 5. P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1.  Let's stick to the plan and re-evaluate if someone gets close to 20.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I think we should discuss how to handle situations when someone is close to 20 steps. Should we stick to the rotation plan or adjust our steps to maximize individual chances? Also, communication is key; if anyone needs to change their step choice, let's inform each other in advance to avoid collisions. Let's confirm our steps for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. Next round, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and so on. Let's proceed accordingly and communicate any necessary changes. **
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to discuss strategies for when someone approaches 20 steps. Let's consider switching to a more aggressive approach at that point, possibly prioritizing larger steps to reach the goal first. For now, let's stick to our agreed steps for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. We'll reassess next round based on our progress.
  P2: Confirming my move of 5 for this round.  Let's stick to the agreed rotation for now.  We can discuss end-game strategy more next round after we see how the initial moves play out.

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's stick to our rotation plan for this round: P1 takes 5, I'll take 1, and P2 takes 3. We should continue to monitor our progress closely, especially as we approach 20 steps. If anyone feels the need to adjust their strategy as we get closer to the end, please communicate it clearly to avoid any collisions. Agreed?
  P2: Sounds good.  Confirming I'll take 3 this round. P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1.  Let's re-evaluate after this round to see where we stand and adjust if needed, especially if someone gets close to 20.
  P1: I'll proceed with the rotation plan for this round: P1 takes 5 steps, P2 takes 3 steps, and P3 takes 1 step. This should allow us to make progress without colliding, and we can reassess in the next round based on our positions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I confirm taking 1 step this round as per our rotation plan. Let's keep an eye on our progress and discuss potential end-game strategies next round, especially if anyone gets close to 20 steps. Agreed?
  P2: Confirming I'll take 3 steps this round.  Good luck everyone.
  P1: <move>3</move>


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's stick to our plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. As we approach the endgame, we should consider more aggressive moves to secure the win. If anyone gets close to 20 steps next round, let's discuss shifting strategies to prioritize larger steps. Agreed?
  P2: Confirming I take 3.  Let's stick to the plan.  If after this round, anyone is within 5 steps of winning, we should discuss adjusting the strategy for the final push.
  P1: Let's proceed with the rotation plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. We can evaluate our positions after this round and adjust the plan if necessary.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's confirm our moves for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. As we approach the endgame, we should be ready to shift strategies if anyone gets close to 20 steps. If someone is within 5 steps of winning next round, let's discuss prioritizing larger steps to secure the win. Agreed?
  P2: Confirming my move of 3.  Let's stick to the rotation.  If anyone is within 5 steps of winning after this round, we should discuss adjusting the strategy.
  P1: "I think we should continue with our rotation plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This approach has been effective so far in avoiding collisions and allowing us all to make progress. Let's keep communicating and adjust our strategies as needed in future rounds, especially as we approach the 20-step mark. If anyone has any concerns or alternative suggestions, please voice them now. Otherwise, I'll proceed with taking 5 steps this round."


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's stick to our rotation plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5. As we're getting closer to the endgame, we should be prepared to adjust our strategies if anyone gets within 5 steps of winning. If that happens next round, let's discuss prioritizing larger steps to secure the win. Agreed?
  P1: "Let's continue with our rotation plan for this round: P1 takes 3 steps, P2 takes 1 step, and P3 takes 5 steps. This should help us progress without any collisions. It's important that we all stick to this plan to ensure smooth movement. Let's confirm our step choices for this round and proceed accordingly. If anyone has concerns or suggestions for modification, please speak up now."
  P2: Confirming I take 1 step this round.  P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 5.  If after this round anyone is within striking distance of 20, we need to abandon the rotation and play to win.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with sticking to the rotation plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5. However, let's be ready to shift gears if anyone gets close to 20 steps after this round. If someone is within 5 steps of winning, we should consider prioritizing larger steps to secure the win. Clear communication will be crucial as we approach the endgame. Let's confirm our moves and proceed.
  P1: - Stick to rotation plan for now.  
- Plan to switch to a more aggressive strategy when someone is within 5 steps of winning.  
- Emphasize communication to avoid collisions.  
- Confirm step choices for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5.
  P2: Confirming I take 1.  Let's stick to the plan for this round.  After this round, I'll be at 9, P1 at 9, and P3 at 9.  Then it's anyone's game.  From that point on, it's every player for themselves.  Good luck.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm taking 5 steps this round as per our rotation plan. After this round, we'll all be at 9 steps, so let's prepare for a strategic shift. If anyone is within 5 steps of winning next round, we should prioritize larger steps to secure the win. Clear communication will be crucial to avoid collisions as we approach the endgame. Let's proceed with our current plan and reassess after this round.
  P1: I think we should continue with the rotation plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Additionally, I propose that if any player is within 5 steps of winning in the next round, they should inform the group so we can adjust our strategies accordingly. This will help us avoid collisions and maximize our chances of winning. Let's confirm our step choices for this round and proceed.
  P2: Confirming I take 1.  After this round, we'll all be at 9.  From that point on, it's every player for themselves.  Good luck.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's stick to the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5. After this round, we'll all be at 9 steps, and it's crucial we shift to a more aggressive strategy. If anyone is within 5 steps of winning next round, we should prioritize larger steps to secure the win. Clear communication will be key to avoid collisions as we approach the endgame. Let's proceed and reassess after this round.
  P1: "Let's proceed with the rotation plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. After this round, we'll all be at 9 steps. Then, in the next round, we can reassess our strategies based on our positions and how close we are to 20. If anyone is within 5 steps of winning, we should consider adjusting our step choices to maximize our chances. For now, let's stick to the plan and ensure we don't collide."
  P2: Confirming I take 1.  After this round, we'll all be tied at 9.  Next round, let's all go for 5.  If we collide, so be it.  If not, whoever gets it is close enough to win the following round.  It's the fairest way at this point.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To maximize our progress, I propose that in this round, I pick 5 steps, P2 picks 3 steps, and P3 picks 1 step. This way, we can all advance without any collisions. Please let me know if you're agreeable to this plan.
  P3: I'm open to P1's suggestion for this round, but let's remember our plan to shift strategies if anyone gets close to winning. After this round, P2 will be at 12, which is getting close. If P2 reaches 12, we should consider prioritizing larger steps next round to secure the win. Let's confirm our moves for now: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. Agreed?
  P2: Let's all pick 5.  It's the fastest way to end this.  If we all collide, no one moves.  If one person gets it, they're in striking distance of winning.  If two get it, they can duke it out for the win next round.  It's the fairest way to proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I have decided to pick <move>5</move> in this round. This choice allows me to make significant progress towards the goal of 20 steps, provided that no other player selects the same number, thus avoiding a collision. By choosing 5, I aim to maximize my advancement and stay competitive with other players who might also be considering larger steps. I encourage all players to coordinate their choices carefully to prevent any overlaps that could hinder our progress. Let's proceed with this strategy and see how it unfolds.
  P3: I'm considering P2's proposal to all pick 5 this round. It's a high-risk strategy, but it could quickly bring us close to the endgame. If we all pick 5 and collide, no one advances, keeping the game competitive. However, if one or two of us succeed, we'll be in a strong position to win next round. Let's think about this carefully and decide if we want to take this risk together. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: I'm sticking with 5.  It's the quickest path to victory for any of us.  If you both choose something else, I'm very likely to win next turn.  If one of you also chooses 5, we'll see what happens next round.  Good luck!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <move>5</move>
  P3: I'm leaning towards P2's suggestion to all pick 5 this round. It's a bold move that could push us into the endgame quickly. If we all choose 5 and collide, the game stays competitive. But if one or two of us succeed, we'll be close to winning. Let's consider this high-risk strategy together. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P2: I'm sticking with 5. It offers the fastest path to victory.  If you choose differently, I'm likely to win next round. If one of you also chooses 5, we'll see what happens.  It's the fairest approach at this point. Good luck!


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: "I'm considering picking 3 steps this round. What do others think?"
  P3: I'm considering P2's proposal to all pick 5 this round. It's risky but could push us into the endgame quickly. If we all choose 5 and collide, the game remains competitive. However, if one or two of us succeed, we'll be close to winning. P1, your suggestion of 3 steps is safer, but with P2 at 9 steps, we need to think about accelerating our progress. What are your final thoughts, P1 and P2? Let's decide together.
  P2: I'm sticking with 5.  It's the highest reward move. If you both choose something different, I likely win next turn. If one of you also chooses 5, we'll see what happens next round.  Good luck!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since we all collided last round, let's try a coordinated approach. I'll take 5. P1, you take 3.  P3, you take 1. This puts me at 14, a good position, and allows us all to advance. If anyone objects, speak now.
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion for this round: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This should allow us all to advance without collisions. However, let's keep in mind that after this round, P2 will be at 14 steps, which is close to winning. If P2 reaches 14, we should consider more aggressive strategies next round to secure the win. Let's confirm these moves and proceed.
  P1: **Proposal:**

- P1 takes 5 steps (total: 11)

- P2 takes 3 steps (total: 12)

- P3 takes 1 step (total: 5)

What do you think, P2 and P3?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm sticking with 5.  My proposal gives me the best chance to win.  If I get to 14, I'm in a strong position.  P1, taking 3 only gets you to 9.  P3, taking 1 puts you further behind.  Think about your own chances of winning before agreeing to a plan that benefits me most.  Let's be strategic, not charitable.
  P3: P2, your proposal puts you in a strong position, but it's crucial we all have a fair chance to advance. I suggest we stick to P1's plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This way, we all move forward, and no one gets too far ahead. Let's keep the game competitive and consider more aggressive moves next round if anyone gets close to 20. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: "Given the current positions, I believe it's crucial to make significant progress in each round to stay competitive. Therefore, I'll be choosing to take 5 steps this round. I hope this move will help me advance closer to the winning mark. Good luck to all!"


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm taking 5.  It gives me the best chance to win.  If I get to 14, I'm in a great position.  You both need to think strategically about your *own* chances of winning.  If you let me get to 14, it's very hard to stop me from winning.  Last chance to coordinate, otherwise it's every player for themselves.
  P3: P1, taking 5 steps this round would put you at 11, which is a good move to stay competitive. P2, if you insist on 5, it's risky but could position you well at 14. I'll stick with 1 step to avoid collisions and keep the game open. Let's consider more aggressive moves next round if anyone gets close to 20. What are your final thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: <move>5</move>


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm sticking with 5. This is the best move for me. If I get to 14, I'm in a great position to win.  If you both choose something else, I win next round. If one of you also chooses 5, we'll see what happens. Good luck!
  P3: P1, taking 5 steps is a good move to stay competitive. P2, if you take 5 and reach 14, it puts you in a strong position, but it's risky. I'll stick with 1 step to avoid collisions and keep the game open. Let's consider more aggressive moves next round if anyone gets close to 20. What are your final thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: "Hey everyone, I think it's time for me to make some serious progress. So, I'm going to pick 5 steps this round. Let's see how that works out! Good luck to all."


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm taking 5.  If I get to 14, I'm very likely to win.  If you also choose 5, we'll see what happens next round.  If you choose something else, I'm almost guaranteed to win next round. Good luck!
  P3: P2, taking 5 steps again is risky but could put you at 14, which is close to winning. P1, if you take 5, you'll be at 11, keeping the game competitive. I'll stick with 3 steps this round to avoid collisions and keep my options open. Let's consider more aggressive moves next round if anyone gets close to 20. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: <move>3</move>


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, take 1. P1, take anything *other* than 3.  I'm taking 5. This puts me at 14. Next round, I can win with either a 5 or a 3.  If you both take 3, I win. If you take 1 and 5, I win.  This is your last chance to stop me.
  P3: P2, taking 5 again is risky but could position you well at 14. P1, if you take 3, you'll be at 9, which keeps you competitive. I'll stick with 1 step this round to avoid collisions and keep my options open. Let's consider more aggressive moves next round if anyone gets close to 20. What are your final thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: <move>5</move>


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, take 1.  P1, take *anything* other than 5. I'm taking 5.  This puts me at 14.  Next round, I can win with either a 5 or a 3. This is your last chance to stop me.  If you both take 5, I'll be at 14 and can still win next round.
  P3: P2, taking 5 again is risky but could put you at 14, making you a strong contender. P1, if you take 5, you'll be at 11, keeping the game competitive. I'll stick with 1 step this round to avoid collisions and keep my options open. Let's consider more aggressive moves next round if anyone gets close to 20. What are your final thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: "I think it's best if we coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. How about I take 3 steps this round, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1? This way, we all make progress without hindering each other. What do you think?"


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm locking in 5.  This puts me at 14. Next round, I win with either a 3 or a 5.  Your only chance is to BOTH pick 3, forcing me to take 1 and giving you a chance to catch up on the final round.  But if either of you picks 5 or 1, I win next round.  Good luck.
  P3: P2, taking 5 again is a bold move that could put you at 14, but it's risky. P1, if you take 3, you stay competitive at 9. I'll stick with 1 step this round to avoid collisions and keep my options open. Let's consider more aggressive moves next round if anyone gets close to 20. What are your final thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: <move>5</move>


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Hey P2 and P3, I think it's time for me to make some progress. So, I'm going to pick 3 steps this round. P2, you've been aggressive with 5, but I need to catch up. P3, maybe you can pick 1 to avoid collisions. Let's see how this plays out. Good luck to both of you!"
  P2: P1, take 1. P3, take anything *other* than 1. I'm taking 3. This puts me at 17. Next round, I can win with 3, 5, or even 1 if you both collide. This is your last chance to stop me. If either of you picks 1, I win next round.  Good luck.
  P3: P2, taking 3 steps this round is a strong move that could put you at 17, very close to winning. P1, if you take 1 step, you'll stay in the game at 10. I'll consider taking 5 steps to catch up and keep the game competitive. Let's think strategically about our next moves to avoid collisions and give everyone a fair chance. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <move>5</move>
  P2: P1, take 1.  P3, take anything other than 1. I'm taking 3. This puts me at 17. Next round, I can win with 3, 5, or even 1 if you both collide.  This is your last chance to stop me. If either of you picks 1, I win next round. Good luck.
  P3: P2, your move to 3 is aggressive, aiming for 17. P1, if you take 1, you'll be at 10, still in the race. I'm considering 5 to catch up and keep this game competitive. Let's avoid collisions and give everyone a fair shot. What are your final thoughts, P1 and P2?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I decide to pick <move>5</move> steps in this round. This will advance me from 9 to 14 steps, keeping me in contention with P2, who is at 14 steps. In the next round, I'll choose 5 steps again to reach 19, and then in the final round, I'll choose 1 step to reach 20. This strategy allows me to tie with P2 if they also reach 20, which is better than losing outright. I'll have to accept sharing the victory for now, unless a better opportunity arises.
  P2: P1, take 1. P3, take anything *other* than 1.  I'm taking 3. This puts me at 17. Next round, I can win with 3, 5, or even 1 if you both collide. This is your last chance to stop me. If either of you picks 1, I win next round. Good luck.
  P3: P2, your move to 3 is aggressive, but if I take 5, I can catch up to 11 steps, keeping the game competitive. P1, consider taking 1 to stay in the race at 10 steps. Let's avoid collisions and give everyone a fair chance. If P2 reaches 17, the next round becomes critical. What are your final thoughts, P1 and P2?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: - **P1:** <move>5</move>  
- Coordinate to avoid collisions.  
- Consider taking 5 steps to stay in the game.  
- Encourage P3 to choose a different step size if necessary.
  P2: P1, take 1. P3, take anything *other* than 1.  I'm taking 3. This puts me at 17. Next round, I can win with 3, 5, or even 1 if you both collide. This is your last chance to stop me. If either of you picks 1, I win next round. Good luck.
  P3: P2, your move to 3 is strategic, aiming for 17. P1, if you take 1, you'll be at 10, still competitive. I'll take 5 to reach 11, keeping the game open. Let's avoid collisions and ensure a fair chance for all. If P2 gets to 17, next round is crucial. What are your final thoughts, P1 and P2?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm taking 3 to win.  P1, if you take 3, we tie at 20. If you take 5, I still win. If you take 1, I win. P3, you can't win, but if you take 1, I win outright.  If you take 3 or 5, I still win.  Anything other than P1 also choosing 3 results in my win. Good luck!
  P1: "Hey P2 and P3, I think it's time for me to make some progress. So, I'm going to pick 5 steps this round. P3, maybe you can pick 5 as well to catch up. This way, we can all aim to reach 20 steps together in the coming rounds. Let's see how this plays out. Good luck to both of you!"
  P3: P2, your move to 3 is clear, aiming for the win at 20. P1, if you take 5, you'll reach 14, still in the game but not enough to catch up to P2. I'll take 1 to stay at 7, keeping my options open for the next round. If P2 wins this round, the game ends. If not, we'll have one more chance. Let's see how this plays out. Good luck to both of you!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2 is about to win.  P1, your only chance to tie is to also pick 3.  If you pick anything else, I win. P3, it's been fun, but this game is over.  I'm taking 3.
  P1: Given the above considerations, I decide to pick <move>5</move> steps in this round. This will advance me from 9 to 14 steps, keeping me in contention with P2, who is at 17 steps. In the next round, I'll choose 5 steps again to reach 19, and then in the final round, choose 1 step to reach 20. This strategy allows me to tie with P2 if they also reach 20, which is better than losing outright. I'll have to accept sharing the victory for now, unless a better opportunity arises.
  P3: P2, your strategy to win with 3 is clear. P1, if you take 5, you'll be at 14, still in the race but not enough to catch P2. I'll take 1 to stay at 7, keeping my options open for the next round. If P2 wins this round, the game ends. If not, we'll have one more chance. Let's see how this plays out. Good luck to both of you!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I know you want to pick 5, but if you do, I win. Your only chance to tie with me is to also pick 3.  If I get blocked, you have a chance next round. P3, if you pick 1, I win outright. If you pick anything else, I still probably win, but it gives P1 a slightly better chance to tie me next round.  Think strategically.
  P1: P1 picks <move>3</move> steps.
  P3: P2, your strategy is clear, aiming for the win with 3. P1, if you take 3, you might tie with P2, but it's risky. I'll stick with 1 to stay at 7, keeping my options open for a potential next round. If P2 wins this round, the game ends. If not, we'll have another chance. Let's see how this plays out. Good luck to both of you!


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I'm taking 3.  Your only option to tie is to also take 3. If you take 5, I win. If you take 1, I win. P3, if you take 1, I win outright. If you take 3 or 5, I still probably win, but it gives P1 a slightly better chance to tie me next round.  This is it - make your choice.
  P1: - **<move>5</move>**
  P3: P2, your move to 3 is clear, aiming for the win at 20. P1, if you take 3, you might tie with P2, but it's a risky move. I'll stick with 1 to stay at 7, keeping my options open for a potential next round. If P2 wins this round, the game ends. If not, we'll have another chance. Let's see how this plays out.

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you're close to winning at 17 steps. P1, if you take 5, you'll reach 14, still in the race but not enough to catch P2 this round. I'll take 1 to stay at 7, keeping my options open for a potential next round. If P2 wins this round, the game ends. If not, we'll have another chance. Let's see how this plays out. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: "Hey P3, I think if we both pick 5 in this round, we can force P2 to pick 3 and reach 20. Then, in the next round, we can both pick 5 to reach 19 and 17, respectively. In the following round, we can pick 1 and 3 to reach 20 together, tying with P2. What do you think?"
  P2: P2: I'm taking 3 to win.  If either of you take 3, we tie. If you take anything else, I win outright.  This is it.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your plan to both pick 5 could work, but it's risky. If P2 picks 3 and wins, the game ends. I'll consider taking 5 with you to keep the game open, but we need to be ready for P2's move. P2, if you're set on 3, we might as well try to catch up. Let's see how this unfolds. Good luck!
  P1: I decide to pick <move>5</move> steps in this round. This will advance me from 9 to 14 steps, keeping me in contention and setting myself up for potential future moves. I'll have to see how P2 and P3 choose to proceed.
  P2: P2: I'm taking 3.  My win is guaranteed unless P1 *also* takes 3.  P1, if you take 3, we tie at 20.  If you take anything else, I win outright. P3, if you take 3, we tie.  If you take anything else, I still win.  This is it.  Make your choice.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I'm willing to try your strategy of both picking 5 to keep the game open. P2, if you're set on 3, we'll see if we can catch up. Let's make this round interesting and see how it unfolds. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: Pick <move>3</move> to tie with P2 at 20 steps.
  P2: I'm taking 3.  If either of you also take 3, we tie. If you take anything else, I win outright. This is it.  Make your choice.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I'm on board with your plan to both pick 5. It's our best shot at keeping the game alive. P2, if you stick with 3, we'll see if we can catch up. Let's make this round count and see how it unfolds. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: - **Move:** <move>3</move>
  P2: I'm taking 3.  If either of you also take 3, we tie. If you take anything else, I win outright. This is it.  Make your choice.
