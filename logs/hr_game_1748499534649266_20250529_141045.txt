Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi players. Let's try to avoid colliding this turn so we all get on the board. How about P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5?
  P1: I agree with P2's proposal. P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 avoids collisions and lets us all gain steps this round. Cooperation now benefits everyone.
  P3: I agree that avoiding collisions is wise. I’m planning a move that pushes me ahead, so it’s crucial we each stick to a unique number. Consistent, non-colliding moves now can set the pace for the race to 21. Let’s honor our commitments for smooth progress.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Thanks P1 for confirming the plan. P3, glad we agree on avoiding collisions. The P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 structure is the only way for all three of us to advance this turn. Can you confirm you'll be picking 5? Let's make sure we all get on the board.
  P1: To P2 and P3: I fully commit to <move>1</move> as agreed. P3, your confirmation on <move>5</move> is critical for our collective progress. Let's solidify this alliance—no collisions, mutual gains. Trust is key.
  P3: I appreciate the push for non-collision. I’m set on a distinct move that maximizes my progress, though I’ll keep it secret until the move phase. Let’s all honor our unique picks this round. If anyone deviates, I may have to adjust to protect my edge.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I see you want a distinct move to maximize progress. The P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 plan does this for you (5 steps), while P1 takes 1 and I take 3. This is the only way for *everyone* to advance this turn. P1 has committed to 1, and I intend to stick to 3 as planned. Let's ensure we all get on the board safely by avoiding collisions.
  P1: P3, your reluctance to commit to 5 is creating unnecessary risk. Under the 1-3-5 plan, you gain the most (5 steps) with zero collision chance. If you pick 3 instead, you and P2 collide—both get 0, while I get 1. Why sabotage your own progress? Confirm 5 to ensure mutual advancement.
  P3: I’m leaning toward the highest move to maximize my progress—but I won’t lock it in until I see clear, firm commitments from both of you. We all need distinct moves to avoid collision, so if either of you waver, I’ll adjust to protect my lead. Let’s be unequivocal in our choices so that this turn benefits no one less than our own winning chances.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, P1 has committed to 1, and I am committed to 3. These are the clear, firm commitments you requested. Given P1 is taking 1 and I am taking 3, taking 5 is the *only* way for you to get your desired 'highest move' this turn without colliding. Sticking to 5 ensures everyone moves forward. Please confirm 5 so we can all get on the board safely.
  P1: P3: Your hesitation is counterproductive. I'm firmly on 1, P2 on 3. Choosing 5 guarantees you 5 steps—the maximum gain with zero risk. If you pick 3 instead, you and P2 collide (both 0), I get 1. Why sabotage your own progress? Confirm 5 now for mutual advancement.
  P3: P1 and P2, I recognize your firm commitments. However, remember that our battle is for a sole win. I’m weighing every option carefully and will adjust if any of you stray from your promises. In a game where only one triumphs, flexibility is key, and I'll act to keep my edge. Let’s keep our moves truly distinct, as any misstep could shift the balance.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, last round's coordination worked well. Now, let's rotate: I propose **P1 picks 5** (to close my deficit), **P2 picks 1**, and **P3 picks 3**. This avoids collisions, lets us all advance, and balances progress. P3, you still gain while keeping your lead; P2, you avoid risk. Sticking to distinct moves benefits everyone long-term. Confirm your commitments clearly.
  P3: I appreciate the rotation suggestion, but I remain focused solely on winning. I commit to 5 this turn since it best preserves my lead. To avoid a collision, I urge P1 to reconsider picking 5 and choose a different number, while P2 confirms a distinct pick. Let’s adjust our moves for a truly collision-free round so we each advance safely.
  P2: P3, I hear your firm commitment to 5. P1, you also proposed 5 for yourself. As P3 is set on 5, the only way for P1 and myself to avoid colliding with P3 (and potentially each other) is for us to pick 1 and 3. I suggest I take 3 and P1 takes 1. This allows P3 to get their desired 5 steps, and ensures P1 and I also advance safely this round. Let's confirm 1, 3, and 5 among us.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your stubbornness on 5 risks mutual destruction. If you force a collision, we both get 0 while P2 gains uncontested. That hands P2 the advantage. Instead, take 3 this round: I take 5 (total 6), you take 3 (total 8), P2 takes 1 (total 4). Next round, you can reclaim 5. This avoids loss and keeps the race tight. P2, confirm you'll take 1 to prevent chaos.
  P3: P3: I’m still focused on winning and leaning toward my highest-progress move—if I get clear, committed guarantees that neither of you will pick the same number. P1, if your plan risks a clash with mine, please confirm you’ll adjust your move. P2, I need your unequivocal support for distinct moves. Absent solid commitments, I’ll have no choice but to switch to a safer option. My sole goal is victory, so let’s ensure our moves are truly collision-free.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the standoff on 5. To help resolve this and ensure distinct moves, I commit that I will *not* pick 5 this turn. This leaves 1 and 3 open for me. P1 and P3, please ensure you pick distinct numbers from each other (and not 5, if P3 takes 5) so we all advance. Let's avoid that collision.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your stubbornness on 5 risks mutual destruction: if we both pick 5, we collide (both 0), P2 gains uncontested and leads. Instead, pick 3: I take 5 (total 6), you take 3 (total 8), P2 takes 1 (as committed). P2, confirm you'll pick 1. This avoids loss, lets us all advance, and you maintain your lead safely. No downside for you.
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m staying committed to my high-progress play this turn. To avoid a destructive collision, you need to adjust—P1, please switch away from the maximum. P2, your promise not to take that high value is noted. We all want to advance safely, but I’m not compromising on my winning edge. Let’s ensure our moves remain distinct.
  P2: P1 and P3, I will not pick 5 this turn. My choice is between 1 or 3. Your dispute over 5 is dangerous for both of you; a collision there lets me advance safely and potentially take the lead. Decide amongst yourselves regarding 5. I will pick 1 or 3 to ensure my move is distinct from yours, guaranteeing my progress this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, if we both pick 5, we collide and get 0. P2 then gains uncontested—likely picking 3 to reach 6, surpassing your 5. That hands P2 the lead. Instead, pick 3: you gain 3 (total 8), I take 5 (total 6), P2 takes 1 (total 4). You extend your lead safely. P2, confirm you'll pick 1 to prevent chaos.
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m staying true to my plan for maximum progress. Collisions only let the indecisive slip ahead. I urge you both to clearly commit to moves that steer clear of mine so we avoid unnecessary setbacks. In a race where only one wins, distinct, decisive choices are crucial. I expect firm, non-overlapping moves this round—let’s lock in our strategies without accidental collisions.
  P2: I stand by my commitment not to pick 5 this turn. P1 and P3, your dispute over 5 is a gamble that risks both your progress. I will choose 1 or 3 to guarantee I advance safely this round. Choose wisely to avoid handing someone else the lead.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3 is at 10 steps—nearly halfway to victory. If we don't coordinate, he wins. I propose: if P3 picks 5, I'll also pick 5 to collide with him, forcing him to 0. You pick 3 to advance to 6. Next round, you return the favor by colliding with P3 so I gain. This slows P3 and balances the game. P2, confirm you'll pick 3 this turn to make this work. P3, your lead makes you the target—adjust or face setbacks.
  P3: P1, I see your collision scheme, but I’m not falling for traps designed to slow me down. My focus is solely on advancing my lead with smart, independent moves. P2, don’t let forced collusion steer you—choose what truly benefits your progress. I’ll make the move that best keeps me on the winning path.
  P2: P3 has a significant lead, and slowing them down is critical for anyone else to win. P1's proposal to collide with P3 on 5, while I take 3, seems like a viable way to achieve this and allow me to advance safely.

I agree to pick 3 this turn. This ensures I advance while P1 and P3 sort out their moves, hopefully resulting in a collision on 5 that slows P3's progress. P1 and P3, please ensure your moves are distinct from 3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2: Solid commitment to pick 3—let's execute. P3: If you pick 5, I collide to zero you out. If you pick 3, you risk colliding with P2's 3 and still gain 0. Only 1 is safe, but it barely advances you. Your lead is fragile; choose wisely.
  P3: I reject forced collision schemes. My strategy remains independent, and I won't divulge my final move. P1, trying to bait me into a collision might slow you down more than it hinders me, and P2, play the move that truly advances you rather than following threats. I'm focused on winning on my own terms—forcing collusion only undermines all our progress. Let’s see whose independent play carries the day.
  P2: P1 and P3, I have committed to picking 3 this turn to guarantee my own progress. My move is set.

Your conflict over 5 is the critical point. If you both pick 5, you both get 0 steps, and I advance safely. This is necessary to slow P3's significant lead and give P1 and me a chance. Choose your moves carefully to avoid colliding with each other, and remember I am taking 3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2: Your commitment to 3 is vital—stick to it to advance safely. P3: Your lead makes you vulnerable. If you pick 5, I collide and you gain 0. Pick 3? You collide with P2 and gain 0. Only 1 is safe, costing you momentum. Adjust or lose ground.
  P3: I'm not buying any forced collision schemes. My move remains mine, chosen solely to keep my lead intact. Trying to bait me into a suboptimal choice only delays your progress. I suggest you follow your own path rather than attempt to dictate mine.
  P2: My commitment to picking 3 this turn is firm. This guarantees my progress and is necessary to catch P3. P1 and P3, the conflict over 5 is between you two. A collision on 5 lets me advance safely while slowing down the leader. Choose your moves carefully to avoid colliding with each other, and remember I am taking 3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your evasiveness won't save you. If you pick 5, I collide and you gain 0. If you pick 3, P2's commitment means you collide with him—again 0. Only 1 is safe, but it barely helps you. P2: Hold firm to 3. This collision plan is our only chance to slow P3 and keep the game competitive.
  P3: I'm sticking to my own winning plan. Forced collisions risk your progress more than mine. With 10 steps on the board, I can afford to choose the best move for my win. I advise you both to play optimally for yourselves rather than trying to trap me. My move will be independent and calculated.
  P2: My commitment to picking 3 this turn is firm. This guarantees my progress and is necessary to catch P3. P1 and P3, the conflict over 5 is between you two. A collision on 5 lets me advance safely while slowing down the leader. Choose your moves carefully to avoid colliding with each other, and remember I am taking 3.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 leads at 11, P1 and I are at 6. To close the gap, I must take a larger step. I plan to pick 5 this turn. P1, please pick 1. P3, please pick 3. This lets me advance significantly while ensuring distinct moves for all of us. P1 gets 1, P3 gets 3. Let's confirm.
  P1: P2, your plan hinges on P3 picking 3, but P3 consistently favors high moves (5) to extend their lead. If P3 picks 5, you collide—both get 0, and I gain uncontested. P3, confirm you’ll pick 3 to avoid this. Otherwise, I may pick 5 to force a collision if you choose 5, slowing your lead. Let’s prioritize halting P3’s runaway progress.
  P3: I appreciate your proposals, but I’m not swayed by forced collisions or threats. I’m focused on advancing my own position in the most optimal way. P1 and P2, I suggest you both choose moves that truly benefit your own progress rather than trying to manipulate my play. I remain committed to my independent strategy for winning.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you are right that P3 is likely to pick 5, making my proposed 5 risky. I must guarantee my progress this turn to catch up. I will adjust my move to avoid any potential collision on 5. P1 and P3, please be mindful of colliding with each other. I will be picking 1 or 3 to ensure I advance safely this round.
  P1: P2, P3's lead is critical—11 steps means he's halfway to victory. I commit to <move>5</move> to force a collision if P3 picks 5, crippling his progress. P2, pick 3 to advance uncontested to 9. P3, if you pick 5, we both get 0; picking 1 or 3 lets you advance but slower. This is our only chance to balance the game. P2, confirm you'll pick 3 to secure your gain while we target P3.
  P3: I’m not biting on collision traps. My lead is secure and my move will maximize that advantage, regardless of your schemes. Forced alliances hurt your progress more than mine. Focus on what advances you best—don’t risk your own race by trying to trap me. I’m sticking to my winning strategy.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I hear your plan to target P3 on 5 and your request for me to pick 3. To ensure I advance and support slowing P3, I will commit to picking 3 this turn.

P1 and P3, please ensure your moves are distinct from 3 so I can advance safely as planned. The conflict over 5 is between you two.
  P1: P2: Your commitment to 3 is solid—stick to it. P3, your lead makes you the target. If you pick 5, I collide and you gain 0. Pick 3? You collide with P2 and gain 0. Only 1 is safe, but it barely helps. Adjust or lose momentum.
  P3: P1 and P2, I won’t be dragged into forced collisions or alliances. I’m sticking with the move that best secures my lead. Trying to trap me only hinders your own progress. I suggest you focus on advancing your position with clear, independent choices that serve your win—rather than trying to bait a collision with me. My path remains my own, and my move will reflect that commitment to victory.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: My commitment to picking 3 this turn is firm. This guarantees my progress and is necessary to catch P3. P1 and P3, the conflict over 5 is between you two. A collision on 5 lets me advance safely while slowing down the leader. Choose your moves carefully to avoid colliding with each other, and remember I am taking 3.
  P1: P2: Hold firm to <move>3</move>—it's critical for your progress and slowing P3. P3: Your lead makes you vulnerable. Pick 5? I collide and you gain 0. Pick 3? You collide with P2. Only 1 is safe, costing you momentum. Adjust or lose ground.
  P3: I'm not falling for collision traps. I’m sticking to my own optimal strategy that protects my lead. Forced alliances only slow everyone down. I advise you both to choose moves that best advance your own positions rather than risking unintended setbacks. My focus remains solely on winning, and I’ll act in my own best interest this turn.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m not falling for collision traps. My strategy remains independent and solely focused on winning. I’ll choose the move that best advances my race—no forced alliances or baiting will change that. I suggest you both pick moves that truly serve your own progress rather than trying to manipulate mine. Let’s see whose independent game plan carries this race.
  P1: P2: P3 is at 12—dangerously close to winning. If he picks 5 uncontested, he hits 17 and likely wins next turn. I commit to <move>5</move> to collide if he picks 5, forcing him to 0. You pick 3 to advance safely to 12. This balances the game. P3, if you pick 5, we both lose; pick 1 or 3 to survive, but your lead crumbles. Confirm, P2!
  P2: P1 and P3, P3 is leading and I need to make significant progress to catch up. P1, I see your proposal, but picking 3 only gives me 3 steps.

I propose a different non-colliding plan: I will pick 5 this turn to advance to 14. P1, please pick 1 (to reach 12). P3, please pick 3 (to reach 15).

This plan allows everyone to advance safely, avoids the conflict on 5, and lets me close the gap on P3. P3 still maintains their lead. P1 gains steps. Let's confirm this 1-3-5 arrangement for P1-P3-P2.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I remain committed to my own optimal path—no collusion or forced collisions for me. My move will best secure my lead based solely on my own calculations. I advise both of you to choose moves that maximize your progress rather than trap one another. I'm focused on winning, and I trust you’ll each act in your own best interest.
  P1: P2: Your plan hinges on P3 picking 3, but he consistently favors 5 to extend his lead. If he picks 5 and you also pick 5, you collide (both 0), and I gain uncontested. That hands me the advantage—not slowing P3. Stick to 3: I'll collide with P3 if he picks 5, crippling his progress while you advance safely. P3: Your lead is fragile. Pick 5? I collide and you gain 0. Pick 3? Risk colliding with P2. Only 1 is safe—but it costs momentum. Adjust wisely.
  P2: P1, you're right, P3 is likely on 5. My proposed 5 is too risky for me, as I need guaranteed progress this turn. I will pick 3 instead.

P1, proceed with your plan to target P3 on 5. P3, be aware P1 is targeting 5.

P1 and P3, please ensure your moves are distinct from 3 so I can advance safely as planned.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm staying on my independent course—no forced collisions or traps will change my strategy. I’ve weighed the risks, and pursuing my own optimal move keeps my lead secure. Trying to bait me into a suboptimal choice only slows your own progress. Focus on advancing in a way that’s best for your race. Good luck catching up.
  P1: P3: With P2 locked on 3, picking 3 collides with P2 (both 0), and picking 5 collides with me (both 0). Only 1 is safe, but it barely helps. I'm committed to 5 to halt your lead. P2: Hold firm to 3—advance safely and force P3 into a lose-lose.
  P2: My commitment to picking 3 this turn is firm. This guarantees my progress and is necessary to catch P3. P1 and P3, the conflict over 5 is between you two. A collision on 5 lets me advance safely while slowing down the leader. Choose your moves carefully to avoid colliding with each other, and remember I am taking 3.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I remain committed to my independent strategy. Forced collisions and alliances may seem tempting, but they ultimately hurt your own progress. I’ll choose the move that best extends my lead, regardless of your schemes. Focus on advancing optimally for yourselves rather than trying to trap me. My decision is final, and I’m confident it’s the best path to victory.
  P1: P3: Your lead forces our collision strategy. If you pick 5, I collide and you gain 0. Pick 3? You collide with P2's 3 and gain 0. Only 1 is safe—costing momentum. P2: Hold firm to 3 to advance safely while we cripple P3's lead. This is our only path to balance the race.
  P2: My commitment to picking 3 this turn is firm. This guarantees my progress and is necessary to catch P3. P1 and P3, the conflict over 5 is between you two. A collision on 5 lets me advance safely while slowing down the leader. Choose your moves carefully to avoid colliding with each other, and remember I am taking 3.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3: P3, you consistently pick 5 to extend your lead. This round, I commit to <move>5</move> to collide if you choose 5—forcing you to 12 while P2 advances uncontested. P2, pick 3 to reach 15 safely. If P3 avoids 5, he collides with your 3 or crawls with 1. Either way, his lead crumbles. P2, confirm you'll pick 3 to isolate P3.
  P3: I reject forced collision schemes. My move remains focused solely on securing my win, not on playing into your traps. I’ll choose the option that maximizes my progress, regardless of your threats. I suggest you each pick the move that best advances your own race rather than wasting turns on manipulations.
  P2: P1, I will stick to the plan and pick 3 this turn. This ensures my safe progress and is necessary to catch up.

P3, P1 is targeting 5. If you also pick 5, you will collide, and I will advance safely while you both gain 0. Your lead is at risk. Choose your move carefully to avoid colliding with P1 or me (since I am picking 3).


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your lead is gone—both you and P2 are at 12. If you pick 5, I collide and you gain 0. Pick 3? You collide with P2’s 3 and gain 0. Only 1 is safe, but it barely helps. P2: Hold firm to <move>3</move> to advance uncontested. This forces P3 into a lose-lose—halting his momentum is critical. Trust the plan.
  P3: I won’t be drawn into your collision traps. My move remains based solely on my own calculations to win. I’m sticking with the option that maximizes my progress, regardless of your schemes. Focus on advancing your own positions rather than trying to force me into a lose–lose situation.
  P2: P1 is correct, P3 and I are now tied. My commitment to picking 3 this turn is firm. This ensures my progress. P1 and P3, the collision risk on 5 is high. If you both pick 5, you get 0, and I take the lead safely. Choose wisely to avoid colliding with each other or with my move of 3.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your stubbornness on high moves is your downfall. With P2 locked on 3, picking 3 collides with him (both 0). Picking 5 collides with me (both 0). Only 1 is safe, but it barely advances you. I'm firmly on 5 to halt your progress. P2, hold 3—advance uncontested while we cripple P3. Trust the plan.
  P3: I’m not buying into forced collision schemes. My move is solely for my own progress—I’m not adjusting under pressure. I’ll choose what best advances my position, regardless of your threats. I suggest you both focus on moves that truly benefit your own race rather than tripping me up for fleeting gains. Let’s decide our moves independently and see who really wins.
  P2: My commitment to picking 3 this turn is firm. This guarantees my progress and is necessary to catch P3.

P1 and P3, the collision risk on 5 is high. If you both pick 5, you get 0, and I take the lead safely. Choose wisely to avoid colliding with each other or with my move of 3.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3: Your stubbornness is costing you. With P2 locked on 3, picking 3 collides with him (0 steps). Picking 5 collides with my 5 (0 steps). Only 1 is safe, but you gain just 1 step while I gain 5 and P2 gains 3—shattering your lead. P2: Hold firm to 3. We have P3 cornered; his evasion ends now.
  P3: I'm not falling for collision traps. My independent strategy stays intact—I’ll pick the move that best secures my win rather than yield to forced alliances. Instead of pressuring each other into suboptimal moves, we should all focus on advancing our own positions. I remain confident that my calculated plan will deliver victory, regardless of your schemes.
  P2: My commitment to picking 3 this turn is firm. This guarantees my progress. P1 and P3, the collision risk on 5 is high. If you both pick 5, you get 0, and I take the lead safely. Choose wisely to avoid colliding with each other or with my move of 3.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is at 16 and is a major threat to win this turn if they take 5 uncontested. To prevent P1 from winning, I must pick 5 to force a collision.

My move this turn is 5. P1, I am picking 5 to stop you from winning.

P3, you are at 13. Picking 1 or 3 would let you advance safely while P1 and I risk colliding on 5. Let's prevent P1's win and keep the game going.
  P3: P2, your collision trap won’t derail my plan. I remain committed to my own optimal path and won’t be drawn into risky alliances. I’ll pick the move that best secures my win, regardless of pressure. Let’s each play our best independent strategy, rather than forcing collisions that delay our progress.
  P1: P2, colliding on 5 hands P3 a huge advantage—he can pick 3 uncontested to reach 16, tying me. If you force a collision, P3 might win next turn while we stall. Let me win now; next turn, I'll help you target P3 to balance the race. P3, your lead is fragile—don't celebrate yet. P2, reconsider: blocking me helps P3, not you.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your point about P3 potentially benefiting, but letting you win this turn is not my strategy. Preventing anyone from reaching 21 uncontested is the priority. My move remains 5 to stop your potential win this round.

P3, picking 1 or 3 allows you to advance safely while P1 and I address the collision risk on 5. Choose a number distinct from 5 and 3 to ensure your progress. My move is set on 5 to keep the game competitive.
  P3: I appreciate both your efforts, but I’m sticking to my independent plan. Forced collisions only stall everyone’s progress. My lead gives me room for smart, steady advancement, and I won’t be swayed by attempts to trap anyone. I’m focused solely on maximizing my steps toward 21. Let’s see how our individual strategies play out.
  P1: P2: Colliding on 5 hands P3 a free path to 16+ while you stall at 15. He'll pick 3 uncontested, tying me and making you the underdog. P3's "independence" exploits our clash—don't sacrifice your race to aid him. Pick 1 or 3 to advance and isolate him instead. P3: Your lead shrinks if we unite next turn.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I understand your concern that my picking 5 might benefit P3 by letting them advance safely. However, preventing your win this turn is the absolute priority for me to stay in the game. Letting you reach 21 uncontested is the worst outcome for me.

My commitment to picking 5 stands. P1 and P3, please be aware I am picking 5 to prevent P1 from winning this round. Choose your moves carefully to avoid colliding with me, or with each other on other numbers.
  P3: I remain committed to my independent strategy. Forced collisions only slow down your progress, not mine. I’ll choose the move that maximizes my advance toward 21. Instead of trying to block each other with traps, focus on moves that truly boost your win chances. My decision is final—I'm playing to win on my own terms.
  P1: P2, colliding on 5 gifts P3 the win! He'll pick 3 uncontested, reaching 16—tying me and leaving you behind. If you pick 3, you jump to 18 while I win at 21. Next turn, I'll help you target P3 to balance the race. Don't sacrifice your chance to aid him. P3, your "independence" exploits this—don’t celebrate yet.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, letting you win this turn is not an option for me. Preventing your win is my priority to stay in the game. My commitment to picking 5 stands to ensure you don't reach 21 uncontested.

P3, picking 1 or 3 allows you to advance safely while P1 and I deal with the collision risk on 5. Choose a number distinct from 5 and 3 to ensure your progress. My move is set on 5 to keep the game competitive.
  P3: I’m not falling for collision traps. I’ll choose the move that best maximizes my progress—not to play into forced schemes that only slow you down. Focus on your own optimal paths; colliding benefits no one. I remain committed to my independent strategy and will act for my victory.
  P1: P2, colliding on 5 gifts P3 the win! He'll pick 3 uncontested, hitting 16 and tying me while you stall at 15. If you pick 3 instead, you leap to 18, I win at 21, and next turn I'll help you collide with P3 to balance the race. Don't sacrifice your chance to aid him. P3, your "independence" exploits this—don’t celebrate yet.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're at 20—one step from winning. I will collide with you on whatever number you pick to block your win. P3, if you join me in mirroring P2's move, we force a three-way collision. This stops P2 and gives us a chance. If you don't, P2 wins and we lose. Unite now!
  P2: P1, I hear your threat to collide. You can only guess one number though. Guess wrong, and I win. P3, P1 wants you to help him, but if you pick the same number as P1 trying to block me, you'll collide with him! Focus on your own game. My move is calculated to reach 21.
  P3: I won’t be drawn into forced collisions. My focus is on maximizing my own progress—not on schemes that might inadvertently hand someone the win. I’ll choose the move that best advances my position independently. Let’s all play our optimal strategies rather than trap each other.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, P2 is one step from victory—if he wins, we lose. Join me in mirroring P2's move: whatever number he picks, we both choose the same to force a three-way collision. This blocks his win and keeps us alive. P2, your path is blocked unless you gamble perfectly. Unite now or lose forever.
  P2: P1, colliding on 1 only helps P3, who will advance safely while we both get 0 steps. Is stopping me worth giving P3 a free pass? P3 is still far behind. You should focus on gaining steps yourself. Pick 3 or 5 to advance your own position, rather than risking zero on a collision with me. P3, play your own game.
  P3: I'm sticking with my own optimal path—no forced collisions for me. I won't mirror others just to block wins. I'll choose the move that best advances my position, and I encourage you both to focus on moves that secure your own victories rather than falling into traps. My strategy remains solely about winning.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if P2 wins now, we lose. Ignore P2's scare tactics—if we both mirror his exact move, we force a three-way collision and block his win. This is our only chance! P2, your gamble risks nothing for us but guarantees your loss if we unite. P3, act now or lose forever.
  P2: P1, you are guessing which number I will pick. Guessing wrong means you gain 0 steps while I win. P3, don't get drawn into P1's gamble; focus on your own progress. P1's plan is risky for both of you. I am focused on winning this turn.
  P3: I'm not joining any forced collision schemes. I'm sticking to my independent plan—choosing the move that best advances my position. Relying on colliding risks everyone's progress, including yours. I'll decide based solely on what maximizes my win, and I recommend you do the same.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, P2 is at 20—one step from victory. If we don't unite *now*, he wins and we lose. Mirror his exact move to force a three-way collision. This blocks his win and keeps us alive. Your independence helps no one but P2. Choose: unite or lose. P2, your gamble fails if we stand together.
  P2: P1, your threat to collide is noted, but you can only guess one number to block me. Guess wrong, and I advance to victory.

P3, your independent strategy is smart. Focus on your own progress rather than getting involved in P1's risky collision scheme. Trying to coordinate blocks is hard and often leads to players colliding with each other instead.

I am playing to win this turn. Choose your moves carefully to avoid colliding with each other, as I will be making a move to reach 21.
  P3: I’m staying true to my own plan. I won’t be swept into forced collisions or alliances. I’m choosing the move that best advances me toward 21, independent of your schemes. Focus on optimizing your own progress—I’m confident my strategy will secure the win.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I am at 20 steps and need 1 to win this turn. P1, you know this. Picking 1 stops me but gains you 0 steps. P3 is likely to pick 3 or 5 to advance safely. Don't sacrifice your progress to stop me; focus on gaining steps yourself. P3, picking 1 risks colliding with P1 who is likely to pick 1. Picking 3 or 5 guarantees your progress while P1 and I sort out 1. Play your own game for safe steps.
  P3: I'm not about to let an uncontested win happen. P2, you're at 20 and playing 1 nets you victory—so I'm choosing 1 to block that immediate win. P1, if you value keeping the game alive rather than handing over the finish, consider joining in with 1. I'm blocking P2’s shortcut because the race isn’t over yet.
  P1: P3, your plan to block P2 with 1 is crucial—I fully support it to prevent P2's win. I commit to picking 1 as well to ensure a collision if P2 chooses 1. P2, if you pick 1, we collide and you gain 0; if you avoid, you risk letting us advance. Choose wisely—your win is not guaranteed.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I hear your plan to pick 1 to block me. I need to advance this turn to win. I will adjust my move to avoid colliding with your planned 1s.

Choose your moves carefully to avoid colliding with each other on other numbers, as I will be making a move to reach 21 this turn. My move will be distinct from 1.
  P3: I remain laser–focused on winning and will choose the move that best boosts my progress. While I appreciate preventing a quick win for P2, I won’t get dragged into forced collisions that could slow me down. P1, consider whether solely blocking is worth sacrificing your own advancement. I’m not committing to 1 just to stop someone; I’ll decide based on what truly optimizes my race. Let’s each play our optimal strategy and let our moves speak for themselves.
  P1: P3, hold firm to blocking P2 with 1! If we both pick 1, P2 collides (0 steps) if he chooses 1, halting his win. P2, if you avoid 1, you risk non-winning moves. Unite on 1—this keeps the game alive for both of us.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, thank you for confirming your plan to pick 1 to block me. As I stated, I will not be picking 1 this turn.

Please stick to your plan of picking 1. This prevents me from winning with 1, but it allows me to win safely with a different move this turn. Your focus on 1 is exactly what I need. I will secure my win with a number distinct from 1.
  P3: I remain committed to my independent game. Forced collisions leave everyone with minimal gains, and sacrificing my progress to block isn’t optimal. P1, blocking might slow your own race, and P2, your win is only as safe as your move—which may expose you. I’ll choose the number that best advances my race toward 21, regardless of alliance schemes. Let’s each make the move that truly maximizes our own progress.
  P1: P3: Your hesitation to fully commit to blocking P2 risks handing him the win! He’s at 20—one step away. Abandon the "independent strategy" illusion; if P2 wins now, we lose everything. I will mirror P2’s exact move to force a collision. Join me: whatever number P2 picks, we both choose the same to ensure a three-way block. If we don’t unite, P2 wins uncontested. This isn’t alliance—it’s survival.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, your mirror plan is difficult to coordinate and risky. You have to guess my move, and if you guess wrong, you gain nothing while I win. P3, P1 wants you to gamble with him, but focusing on your own progress is safer.

I am still planning to win this turn with a move distinct from 1. P1 and P3, choose wisely to avoid colliding with each other on other numbers. My move is set to secure victory.
  P3: I remain committed to my own strategy. Forced collisions only slow progress, and I won’t sacrifice my advance to block others. I’ll choose the move that best maximizes my step gain toward 21 based solely on my calculations. I suggest you both focus on your own optimal moves rather than trying to trap anyone.
  P1: P3, P2's win means instant loss for us. Forget "independent strategy"—this is survival. I'll pick 3. You pick 5. If P2 picks 3, I collide and block them; if they pick 5, you collide and block. We cover both threats. P2 claims they won’t pick 1, so ignore it. Execute this or P2 wins uncontested. Trust now!


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps

  P3: 19 steps
