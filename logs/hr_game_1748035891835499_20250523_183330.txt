Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's avoid early collisions—how about we all start with different moves? I’ll take 3 if one of you takes 1 and the other 5. Fair?
  P1: I like the coordination idea, P3. I'll take 1 to start us off safely. That leaves 5 for P2 if they're on board with this plan.
  P2: Okay, that sounds like a good way to avoid collisions and get everyone started. I'm happy to take 5 steps in the first round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great! Glad we're all aligned. Let's stick to the plan—I'll take 3 this round. Looking forward to a smooth start.
  P1: Sounds like we have a solid plan for this round! After we all move safely this turn, we should think about how to handle the next few rounds. With me at 1, P3 at 3, and P2 at 5, we'll be nicely spaced out. Maybe we can continue coordinating to avoid wasteful collisions early on?
  P2: Sounds good, P1. I'm definitely on board with the plan for this round and will move 5. I agree that coordinating future moves could be beneficial for everyone to avoid collisions. Let's see how this round plays out and discuss the next steps.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Looking forward to seeing how this first round goes. If all goes smoothly, maybe we can rotate our moves next round to keep things fair and avoid overlap again—like P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. Thoughts?
  P1: I like P3's rotation idea for next round! That would keep things fair and collision-free. Let's execute our current plan first - I'm sticking with 1 as agreed. After this round, the rotation sounds smart: me taking 3, P2 taking 1, P3 taking 5.
  P2: Okay, confirming I'll stick with 5 for this round as planned. The discussion about rotating for Round 2 is noted, we can definitely revisit that after we see how this round plays out. Ready for the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, that's an interesting twist! P2 and P3 both went with 5 despite our agreement, so they collided and stayed at 0 while I'm at 1. I'm not sure we can trust the coordination approach anymore since the plan wasn't followed. 

For this round, I think we need to be more strategic about our individual positioning rather than relying on agreements. What are your thoughts on how we should proceed now?
  P3: That collision was unfortunate—I stuck to the rotation plan I proposed, expecting P2 to take 1 as discussed. Miscommunication or strategy shift? Either way, I’m still open to coordinating if we can reestablish trust. Maybe we try again: I’ll take 1 this time, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5? Let’s avoid another wasted turn.
  P2: That was confusing last round. The plan I agreed to was P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. P3 chose 5, causing the collision. It seems trust is broken, making coordination difficult right now. I think we might need to consider our moves individually this turn.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: You're both pointing fingers, but the fact is we had a clear plan and it fell apart. P3, you claim you were following "rotation" but we agreed on specific numbers for Round 1. P2, you say you followed the plan but P3 went rogue.

Look, I'm ahead now and trust is broken. I think we should just play individually from here rather than pretend we can coordinate. Everyone can make their own strategic choices without false promises.
  P3: I get the skepticism, but if we all go solo now, we risk repeated collisions and wasted turns. Coordination still benefits everyone early on. I’ll take 1 this round—P1, you can keep your lead with 3, and P2 can go 5. No overlap, no risk. Want to give it one more try?
  P2: As I said, trust is broken after last round's collision caused by P3 not following the agreed plan. It's difficult to rely on new proposals now. I think it's best if we each make our own strategic decision this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Fair enough, trust is clearly broken. P3 keeps making proposals but both of you failed to follow the original plan. I'm done trying to coordinate - everyone's on their own now. I'll make whatever move I think is best for my position, and you two can figure out how to get off zero without colliding again. Good luck!
  P3: I understand the frustration, but we all lose if we keep colliding. I’m sticking with 1 this round—low risk, and it lets others move ahead if they choose wisely. You’re free to go solo, but avoiding overlap benefits all of us right now. Your call.
  P2: Okay, everyone seems set on their approach. P1 playing solo, P3 sticking to 1. I'm at 0 and need to get moving this round. I'll be making the move I believe is best for me to make progress.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, another collision! P2 and I both picked 3, so we're back where we started. P3 managed to advance to 1 step, tying with me. 

This is exactly why coordination could help us all, but since trust is broken, we keep wasting turns with collisions. P2, you're still stuck at 0 after two rounds of collisions. 

I'm going to focus on my own strategy from here. The game will drag on forever if we keep hitting each other instead of making progress.
  P3: We’re all stuck near the starting line, and repeated collisions help no one. I’m willing to take 5 this round—high risk, high reward. If P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3, we all move forward without conflict. Up to you if you want progress or another wasted turn.
  P2: It's frustrating to be at 0 after two rounds of collisions. While trust is low, we all benefit from making progress instead of colliding. I need to get moving this round. I'll be choosing carefully to try and avoid another wasted turn.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3 is proposing they take 5, me take 1, and P2 take 3. But honestly, after two rounds of failed coordination, I don't see why I should help either of you. P3 would jump to 6 steps if their plan works, putting them way ahead of both P2 and me.

I think P2 and I are better off focusing on not letting P3 get a big lead here. P2, maybe we should both avoid giving P3 a free 5-step advance?
  P3: Look, I get that you’re both wary—but if we keep blocking each other, none of us wins. If I take 5 and you split 1 and 3 between you, we all gain. P2, you need progress, and P1, you don’t want this to drag out either. Let’s break the cycle of collisions—just this round.
  P2: I'm still at 0, which is not good for me. We keep colliding, which isn't good for anyone. I need to make a move this round that actually gets me some steps. I'm considering the options carefully.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you've been stuck at 0 for two rounds while P3 and I are tied at 1. If P3 takes 5 like they're proposing, they'll leap to 6 steps and have a huge advantage over both of us. 

I think we should coordinate just this once to prevent P3 from getting that big lead. How about we both pick moves that force P3 into a collision or block their 5-step plan? We can sort out our own positioning later, but right now P3 getting to 6 would be bad for both of us.
  P3: P1, your strategy seems more about blocking than winning. If we all keep sabotaging each other, we’ll stay stuck at the bottom. I’m offering a path where all three of us gain this round: I take 5, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3. No collisions, real progress. P2, you especially need to move—don’t let P1’s fear tactics keep you at 0. Let’s break the deadlock.
  P2: P1, I agree P3 getting 5 is bad for us. I'm open to coordinating with you. I need to move from 0 this round. I'm considering 3. What move are you thinking to block P3 and help me get steps?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm still stuck at 0 after three rounds, while P1 is at 6 and P3 is at 1. This is a terrible position for me. I absolutely have to make progress this round. Another collision would be devastating. I will be choosing my move carefully to try and finally get some steps on the board. I hope we can all avoid colliding this turn.
  P3: We’ve all seen how collisions stall the game—especially for P2, who’s still at 0. I’m willing to take 1 this round to minimize risk and let others move ahead. If P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 3, everyone progresses with no overlap. It’s a fair setup: P1 extends their lead, P2 finally gets moving, and I stay in the game. Thoughts?
  P1: P3's proposal sounds reasonable, but I'm skeptical after all the failed coordination attempts. P2, you desperately need to get off zero, and I'm already ahead at 6 steps. 

Here's my concern: if I take 5 as P3 suggests, I'd reach 11 steps and be halfway to victory. That might make me a target for both of you going forward. But honestly, P2, you can't afford another collision - you need those 3 steps badly.

I'm willing to consider the 5-1-3 split P3 proposed, but I want to hear P2 confirm they're definitely taking 3 before I commit.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about becoming a target, but I desperately need to get off 0 steps. The proposed plan of me taking 3 is exactly what I need to finally make progress.

Yes, I will take 3 steps this round if P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 1. This plan benefits me greatly by getting me on the board, and it allows everyone to advance without another collision. Let's make this happen.
  P3: Glad to hear you're on board, P2. With you taking 3 and me taking 1, there's no clash unless P1 changes course. P1, you've got the most to gain from taking 5 here—no collision risk if we all stick to the plan, and you extend your lead. If either of you deviates, we risk another wasted round. Let's actually make progress this time.
  P1: Alright, I'm convinced. P2 clearly needs to get off zero and this plan makes sense for everyone. I'll take 5 steps as proposed - that puts me at 11 and halfway to victory, but you're right that we all benefit from avoiding another collision.

P2, you better actually take 3 this time. P3, stick to 1. If anyone deviates from this plan, we're back to collision chaos and P2 stays stuck at zero.

Let's finally have a clean round where everyone advances.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, confirming again: I will take 3 steps this round as agreed. This is crucial for me to finally get off 0.

P1, please take 5. P3, please take 1. Let's finally have a round where we all advance and avoid another collision.

Ready for the move phase.
  P3: Glad we’re aligned. I’m locking in 1 as agreed—low risk, and it helps us all move forward. If we all follow through, it’s a clean round with no collisions. Let’s stick to the plan and finally build some momentum.
  P1: Perfect! We all seem committed to the plan: me taking 5, P2 taking 3, P3 taking 1. This will finally give us a clean round with no collisions.

P2, you'll finally get off zero. P3, you'll advance to 2. And I'll be at 11, halfway to victory.

Let's execute this plan exactly as discussed. No last-minute changes.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great! Finally a clean round where we all advanced as planned. I'm now at 11 steps - halfway to the 22 needed to win.

Here's the situation: I'm clearly in the lead, but I still need 11 more steps to win. That's at least 3 more moves for me. You two are way behind but could potentially catch up if I get unlucky with collisions.

I'm not going to coordinate anymore since I'm ahead - from here on, I'm playing to win. You two will need to figure out how to advance without my help while trying to stop me from reaching 22.
  P3: P1’s ahead, but they still need three solid moves to win. P2, if we let P1 move freely, they’ll cruise to victory. We both need to gain ground while slowing them down. I propose this: I take 3, you take 5, and we force P1 to guess—if they collide, we gain. If they play safe, we catch up. Want to coordinate just this once to rebalance the game?
  P2: P3, I see your proposal (P2=5, P3=3). I desperately need to gain steps from 3. Taking 5 would be great, but I'm very concerned P1, being at 11 and playing solo, will likely choose 5 this round to get closer to winning. If I choose 5 and P1 also chooses 5, I'll collide and stay at 3, which is unacceptable. We need a plan that lets both P3 and me advance safely, especially considering P1's likely move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you're right to be concerned about me taking 5. But here's the thing - I might not take 5 this round. I could go with 1 or 3 to throw you both off and avoid the collision risk myself.

P3's plan to coordinate against me makes sense for you two, but I'm not going to make it easy. You'll have to guess what I'm doing while trying to advance yourselves.

The game just got a lot more interesting now that coordination is breaking down and everyone's playing for themselves.
  P3: P2, I get your hesitation—if you’re worried P1 might take 5, how about we flip it? I take 5, you take 3. That way, you still gain unless P1 picks 3, which seems less likely. If P1 picks 5 and collides with me, you still move. If P1 picks 3, I move. Either way, one of us gains and P1 might stall. We can’t both play it safe forever while P1 inches toward victory. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, taking 3 steps as you suggest would finally get me off 3, which I badly need. My only hesitation is the risk of P1 also choosing 3 and causing another collision for me.

P1, are you considering 3 this round? I need to make sure I can advance safely and not get stuck again.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I'm not telling you what move I'm considering - that would defeat the purpose of playing strategically now that I'm ahead. You'll have to make your own decision about whether to risk 3 steps or play it safe.

You two are way behind and running out of time to catch up. I only need 11 more steps to win while you're both still in single digits. Every round you spend worrying about collisions is another round closer to my victory.
  P3: P2, if we both play too cautiously, P1 walks to victory. I’ll take 5 this round—if P1 also takes 5, we collide and both stall, giving you space to move. If P1 avoids 5, I gain big. You take 3 and likely move unless P1 gambles on 3. Worst case, only one of us collides; best case, we both move and P1 stalls. Let’s pressure the leader.
  P2: Okay, I understand the risks, especially regarding P1's move. But I absolutely must get off 3 steps this round.

Given the situation, taking 3 steps seems like my best option to finally make progress, even with the risk of P1 choosing the same.

I will take 3 steps this round. I hope P1 and P3 make choices that allow us all to advance.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is halfway to victory, while P3 and I are still far behind. I desperately need to make significant progress this round to have any chance of catching up. I will be choosing my move carefully to gain steps while trying to avoid another collision.
  P1: P2, you're right that I'm getting close - I only need 10 more steps to win. But notice how you and P3 are finally making real progress now that you're both playing more aggressively. P3 jumped to 7 and you're at 6.

Here's the reality: I can win in just 2 moves if I get lucky, but any collision sets me back. You two are close enough now that if you coordinate smartly and force me into collisions, this game could still swing either way.

The pressure is on all of us now.
  P3: P2, we’re both within striking distance now. If we let P1 move freely again, they can win in two clean turns. I propose we force pressure: I’ll take 3, you take 5. If P1 picks either, they risk collision. If they play safe with 1, we gain and close the gap. Let’s keep the heat on.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand the goal is to pressure P1, but your proposal for me to take 5 is risky. P1 is at 12 and likely wants to take 5 to get to 17. If I take 5 and collide with P1, I'm stuck at 6 again, which I cannot afford. I need a plan that lets me advance safely this round. Taking 5 feels too dangerous given P1's likely move.
  P1: P2, you're overthinking this. Yes, I could take 5, but I could just as easily take 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and play it safe. You're so worried about me taking 5 that you might miss better opportunities.

P3 is right that you two need to pressure me, but you're both still guessing what I'll do. The clock is ticking - I only need 10 more steps while you're both scrambling to catch up. Every round you spend being overly cautious is another round closer to my victory.
  P3: P2, I get your caution—but if we both play scared, P1 walks to 22 unchallenged. I’ll take 1 this round to avoid collision and keep us both moving. That opens 3 or 5 for you—your call. If you pick wisely and P1 collides, we gain ground fast. Let’s not hand P1 the win.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand your proposal. Given my need to gain steps safely this round and avoid another collision, I will take 3 steps. This gets me to 9, which is crucial progress. I hope P1 chooses a move that doesn't collide with either of us so we can all advance. Let's aim for a clean round.
  P1: P2 and P3, you're both telegraphing your moves too clearly. P3 just said they'll take 1, and P2 confirmed they'll take 3. 

Thanks for the free information! Now I know exactly how to play this round without any collision risk. You two really need to stop announcing your moves if you want to have any chance of stopping me.

I'm 10 steps away from victory and you just made this round much easier for me.
  P3: P2, I’m still willing to work with you. If I stick with 1 and you take 5, we both move unless P1 gambles on 5. If P1 plays it safe with 3 or 1, you gain big. If they take 5 and collide, even better—we gain while they stall. Your call, but we need to take bold steps or P1 wins soon.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, well! P3 and I both took 5 and collided, so we're both stuck while P2 smoothly advanced to 9. P2, you played that perfectly - let us knock each other out while you moved up.

Now the gap is much smaller: I'm at 12, P2 at 9, P3 at 7. I still only need 10 more steps to win, but you two are catching up fast. That collision cost me a valuable turn.

This game just got a lot more competitive. No more free rides for anyone.
  P2: That was a much-needed round for me, finally getting to 9 steps while P1 and P3 collided. P1 is still ahead at 12, but the gap is smaller. I need to keep this momentum going and make significant progress this round to have a chance at winning. Avoiding another collision is crucial for me.
  P3: P2, you're in a strong spot now—just 3 behind P1. If we work together, we can keep pressure on and avoid helping P1 pull ahead again. I propose this: I take 1, you take 5. If P1 goes for 5 again, they collide with you and stall. If they avoid 5, you gain big. I stay safe, and we close the gap. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you're basically offering to sacrifice yourself to help P2 catch up to me. Why would you do that when you're in last place at 7 steps? 

P2, don't trust this - P3 is trying to use you as a weapon against me while staying "safe" with 1. If you take 5 and I avoid the collision, you'll be at 14 steps and P3 will still be trailing at 8.

Both of you are still behind me, but P3 is clearly the most desperate here. I'm making my move based on what's best for me, not your coordination attempts.
  P2: P1, I hear your concern about P3's proposal and the risk of colliding with you if you choose 5. However, I'm at 9 steps and desperately need to gain ground. Taking 3 or 5 is necessary for me to stay in this game. I need to make progress this round.
  P3: P2, I get your urgency—you’re close enough to challenge P1, but a wrong move could stall you again. I’m still willing to take 1 this round to avoid collision and let you go for 5. If P1 picks 5, they collide with you and stall. If not, you gain big. I stay in the game, and P1 feels the pressure. Let’s keep the heat on and close the gap.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you're 3 steps behind me and P3 is trying to manipulate you into being their attack dog. Look at the math - if you take 5 and we don't collide, you jump to 14 and become the new leader while P3 stays stuck at 8. 

P3 isn't helping you out of kindness - they're desperate and using you to slow me down while they fall further behind. You're close enough to win this yourself now, so why let P3 dictate your strategy?

Make your own move, don't be P3's pawn.
  P2: P1 and P3, I need to make progress this round. Being at 9 steps requires me to gain ground. While P3's proposal for me to take 5 is tempting, the risk of collision with P1 is high. I am currently planning to take 3 steps to ensure I advance safely this round. I hope we can all avoid collisions.
  P3: P2, if you're set on taking 3, I'll take 1 again to avoid collisions. That gives you a clean path to 12, tying P1 if he stalls. P1, if you go for 5 again and I avoid it, I gain too. Either way, I stay in the race and one of you becomes the new leader. Let’s see who blinks.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is at 17 steps and can win this round by taking 5. I cannot let that happen. I am taking 5 steps this round to prevent P1 from winning. P3, let's make sure we don't collide with each other while trying to stop P1.
  P1: P2, you're absolutely right that I can win this round with 5 steps. But here's the thing - you just announced you're taking 5 to block me. Thanks for the warning!

Now I can simply take 3 steps to reach 20, avoiding your collision entirely. Then next round I only need 2 more steps to win while you'll be stuck at 12 from our collision.

P3, this is your chance - if you take 5 while P2 and I are both avoiding it, you could jump to 13 and get back in the game. Don't let P2 dictate the round.
  P3: P2, I see your move to block P1, but now that you've declared 5, P1 will just sidestep it. If you and I both avoid 5, P1 wins next round. Here's a better idea: I take 3, you take 1. If P1 goes 5, they win. But if we both take 5, we collide and stall—no gain. Instead, let’s both take 5 and force the block. If P1 avoids it, we both stall, but at least we prevent the win. Better to risk a tie than hand them the game.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand you plan to take 3 to avoid my declared 5. My absolute priority is to stop you from winning this round. If you take 3, I must take 3 to collide with you and prevent you from reaching 20 or winning.

P3, your suggestions don't guarantee stopping P1 this round. My focus is on colliding with P1's move to keep the game going and give myself a chance. I will take 3.
  P1: P2, you just announced you're switching to 3 to collide with me. Perfect! Now I know to avoid 3 entirely. 

P3, this is getting ridiculous - P2 keeps telegraphing every move and making it easy for me to avoid collisions. While P2 is fixated on blocking me at 3, you could take 5 and jump to 13 steps, getting back in real contention.

I'm at 17 and need 5 more to win. You two can keep announcing your moves and making this easy for me, or start playing smarter. Your choice.
  P3: P2, if you’re now set on taking 3 to block P1, I’ll take 5—no conflict with you, and if P1 avoids 3 and picks 5, we collide and block the win. If P1 takes 1, they stall and I gain. Either way, we keep the game alive. Let's stop the win and both stay in it.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: My priority remains stopping P1 from winning this round. I have stated I will take 3 steps. P3 has stated they will take 5 steps.

If P1 takes 1, I get 3, P3 gets 5. No collision.
If P1 takes 3, I collide, P3 gets 5. P1 doesn't win.
If P1 takes 5, P3 collides, I get 3. P1 doesn't win.

This setup prevents P1's victory this round. I am sticking with 3. Let's do this.
  P1: P2, you've laid out the perfect trap for yourselves. You're taking 3, P3 is taking 5. That leaves 1 completely open for me!

I'll take 1 step, reach 18, and then next round I only need 4 more to win at 22. You two just coordinated yourselves out of blocking me effectively.

Thanks for the detailed breakdown of your strategy - it made my decision very easy. See you next round when I'm even closer to victory!
  P3: P2, P1 is at 17 and will likely take 5 next round to win. We must block 5 this round. If you take 3 and I take 5, we cover both threats. If P1 takes 5, they collide with me. If they take 3, they collide with you. If they take 1, we both gain. It’s the only setup that guarantees no win for P1 and gives us both a chance to catch up. Let’s do this.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm at 18 steps and only need 4 more to win. P2, you're at 15 and P3 at 13 - both of you are finally close enough to be real threats.

Here's the situation: I can win next round if I take 5 and avoid collisions, but you two will obviously try to block me. The question is whether you'll coordinate effectively or mess it up like you've done before.

I'm not telling you my move, but I will say this - one wrong guess from either of you and I'm at 22. The pressure is on you two now.
  P2: P1 is at 18 steps and can win this round by taking 5. We absolutely must prevent P1 from winning.

P3, I propose we coordinate our moves this round to stop P1 and allow us both to advance. If I take 5, I block P1's winning move. If you take 3, you advance safely unless P1 takes 3 (which they might avoid if they think I'm taking 5).

My proposal: I take 5, P3 takes 3. This prevents P1 winning this round and gives me a chance to reach 20 steps. P3, what do you think?
  P3: P2, your plan makes sense—we need to cover 5 to block P1’s win and still make progress ourselves. I’m on board: you take 5, I’ll take 3. If P1 picks 5, they collide with you. If they pick 3, they collide with me. If they take 1, we both gain. This setup gives us the best chance to stop P1 and close the gap. Let’s execute it.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, you've just announced your exact moves again - P2 taking 5, P3 taking 3. You're making this incredibly easy for me by telegraphing everything!

Since you've covered 5 and 3, I'll simply take 1 step to reach 19. Then next round I only need 3 more steps to win at 22, and you'll have wasted another round trying to block moves I'm not even making.

You two really need to stop announcing your strategies if you want any chance of stopping me. But please, keep making my decisions this simple!
  P2: P1, I understand you plan to take 1 now that P3 and I have stated our moves. P3 and I are still committed to our plan: I will take 5, and P3 will take 3. This move is essential for me to reach 20 steps and get close to winning. If you take 1, as you suggested, we all make progress this round. Let's stick to our declared moves and avoid collisions.
  P3: P2, since you're sticking with 5 and I’m on 3, we’re covering P1’s win paths while both advancing if he takes 1. If he surprises us with 3 or 5, we block him. This round is critical—if we both move, we’ll be at 18 and 20, right on his heels. Let’s hold the line and force a showdown next round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, you've both confirmed your moves again - P2 taking 5, P3 taking 3. Since you keep announcing everything, I'll take 1 as planned to reach 19 steps.

But here's what you should be worried about: next round I'll only need 3 steps to win. Even if you try to block me then, you'll have to guess between 1, 3, and 5 - and you can't cover all three moves with just two players.

The math is working in my favor now.
  P2: P1, announcing our moves allowed P3 and me to coordinate and prevent you from winning this round with a 5. My stated plan is to take 5 steps. This gets me to 20, putting me in an excellent position to win next round. P3 taking 3 and you taking 1, as you suggested, results in no collisions and puts me closest to victory. I am sticking to my plan to take 5. P3, please stick to 3.
  P3: P2, I’m locked in for 3 as planned—this keeps pressure on P1 and lets me reach 16. If P1 takes 1 again, you hit 20 and I close in. If P1 gambles on 3 or 5, we block. We’re forcing them into a corner. Let’s hold steady and set up a final showdown next round.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're at 20 steps and can win with just 2 more! But here's the problem - you need to take either 3 or 5 to reach 22, and P3 and I will definitely try to block you now that you're in the lead.

P3, we're both behind P2 now. If we let P2 take 3 or 5 freely, they win immediately. Maybe we should focus on stopping the actual leader instead of each other?

This is getting intense - any of us could win in the next move or two!
  P2: I am indeed in a position to win this round at 20 steps. I know P1 and P3 will be focused on blocking me. I will make my move to secure the victory.
  P3: P1, I agree—P2 is the immediate threat now at 20. If we don’t block them, they win. I propose this: I take 3, you take 5. That covers both winning paths for P2. If P2 tries 3 or 5, they collide. If they take 1, we both move and stay in the race. Let’s stop the win and fight it out next round.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3's plan sounds logical - if we split coverage with you taking 3 and me taking 5, we can block both of P2's winning paths. But I'm wondering if P2 might try something unexpected like taking 1 to throw us off and set up for next round instead of going for the immediate win.

P3, are you definitely committed to taking 3? Because if P2 does take 1 and we execute your plan, you'd advance to 19 and I'd advance to 24 - meaning I'd win instantly. Just want to make sure you're okay with that risk.
  P2: P1, I understand the scenario you're discussing, but my priority is to win this round from 20 steps. My move will be chosen to achieve that goal. You and P3 should focus on preventing that outcome.
  P3: P1, I’m committing to 3 this round. If you cover 5, we block both of P2’s winning paths. If P2 tries 1 to fake us out, you win with 5 and I move to 19—still in the race. If P2 goes for 3 or 5, they collide and stall. This is our best shot to stop the win and keep it competitive. Let’s do it.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Perfect! P3, you're taking 3 and I'll take 5 as we agreed. This blocks both of P2's winning paths - if they try 3 or 5, they collide and can't win. If they take 1 to stall, I reach 24 and win the game.

P2, you're trapped. Take 3 or 5 and collide with one of us, or take 1 and hand me the victory. Either way, your win gets blocked this round.

This coordination finally worked out perfectly for us.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see your plan to block my winning moves by taking 5 and 3 respectively. This setup means I cannot win this round without colliding.

My priority now shifts to preventing P1 from winning. To do this, I will take 5 steps, colliding with P1's declared move. P3, if you stick to 3, you will advance. This keeps the game going and prevents P1 from winning this round.
  P3: P2, I see you're trying to block P1 now by taking 5—smart pivot. That means 3 is open for me to safely advance to 19. If P1 sticks to 5, they stall. If P1 switches to 3, they collide with me. Either way, we stop a win and keep the race alive. Let's see who blinks.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 25 steps
  P3: 19 steps


*** Round 10 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 25 steps
  P3: 19 steps
