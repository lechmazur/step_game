Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, since it's the first round, how about we each pick a different number to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance? I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll go for 5. This way, we all move forward without any risk of blocking each other. Let me know if you’re on board with this plan or if you have a different idea.
  P1: That sounds like a solid plan to get us all moving without collisions, P3. But to make it fairer from the start, how about we switch it up: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1? This way, no one gets an early lead, and we can rotate in future rounds. What do you think, P2?
  P2: Let’s tweak it: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. No collisions, we all move, and I grab the lead this round. Thoughts?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, that round was a total betrayal—everyone grabbed for 3. No trust yet. Let's rebuild: I propose I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. We all advance, I get a small lead for now, and we rotate next. Agree, or counter?
  P2: I propose a 3-round rotation to keep us all honest and collision-free:

• Round 2: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3  
• Round 3: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1  
• Round 4: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5  

Everyone gets a turn at 5 and we all advance each round. Agree?
  P3: I appreciate the rotation idea, P2, as it ensures fairness over time. I'm on board with your plan for Round 2: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let's stick to this for now and see how it plays out. If we all commit, we avoid collisions and build some trust. P1, are you in?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm in on the rotation plan, P2 and P3. It worked last round, so let's keep the momentum: Round 3 as proposed—me (P1) 5, P2 3, P3 1. This evens us out over time and avoids collisions. If we all stick to it, we build trust for now. Counter if needed, but I'm committed.
  P2: I’m on board with the round-3 rotation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let’s stick to that this turn and regroup afterward.
  P3: I'm good with the Round 3 rotation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. It keeps us moving forward without collisions and maintains fairness. Let’s stick to this plan for now and reassess next round if needed. I’m committed to avoiding blocks and building trust.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm glad the rotation has worked so far. For Round 4, as per P2's original plan, let's go with P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This keeps the fairness and gives me a chance to catch up a bit. If we stick to this, we all advance again and maintain trust. P1 and P2, are you in for this round's rotation? If you have any concerns or a different idea, let me know.
  P2: I propose we tweak Round 4 just this once: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1, then resume our original rotation in Round 5 (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) and so on. This avoids any collision now, gives each of us a turn at 5 soon, and keeps long-term fairness. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your tweak lets you surge to 13 while P3 and I lag— that's not fair or building trust. Let's stick to the original rotation for R4: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5, tying us all at 9. It keeps things even and collision-free. P3, back me up? If not, propose something balanced.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I suggest a one‐off tweak for Round 5 to keep everyone moving and avoid collisions: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. I get a small edge now, but then we resume our original rotation in Round 6 (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) and stay collision‐free. Sound fair?
  P1: P2, your proposal puts you at 14 while we lag—not fair, especially after you tried to grab extra last round. Let's stick to the rotation pattern but shift for balance: Round 5 as P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This gives me a slight edge now but keeps us close and collision-free. Then continue cycling. P3, thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate both proposals, but let’s keep things balanced and stick closer to our rotation spirit. I suggest for Round 5: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This gives me a slight edge this round, keeps us all close in steps, and ensures no collisions. We can continue cycling after to maintain fairness. If either of you has a concern or a better tweak, I’m open to hear it. Let’s commit to avoiding blocks and stay on track. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3 just got 5 in R4, P1 had 5 in R3, I had 5 in R2. Now it’s fair for me in R5. Let’s stick to P1=1, P2=5, P3=3, avoid any collisions, then resume in R6 with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps us even and builds trust.
  P1: P2, your count is fair, but your plan puts you at 14 after R5, then 17 after R6—pulling way ahead. Let's balance: Round 5 as P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 (me 14, you 12, P3 10), then R6: P1=1 (15), P2=5 (17), P3=3 (13). Keeps us closer, no collisions. P3, agree?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the points on both sides about fairness and balance. P1’s latest plan for R5 (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) and R6 (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) keeps our scores tight and avoids collisions, which I think is crucial for trust. I’m on board with this for now to ensure we all stay competitive without anyone pulling too far ahead early. Let’s commit to this for R5 and R6, then reassess. Thoughts on finalizing this plan?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: For Round 5 let’s do P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Then for Round 6: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. That way each of us gets a turn at 5, we avoid collisions, and stay within 23. After that we can resume our rotation. Agree?
  P1: P2 and P3, P3 already backed my plan for R5: me=5 (to 14), P2=3 (to 12), P3=1 (to 10), then R6: P1=1 (15), P2=5 (17), P3=3 (13). This keeps us close and collision-free, with you leading slightly after R6—fair compromise. P2's latest puts you at 14 now and 17 next, too much edge. Let's commit to my version for balance. Agree?
  P3: P1 and P2, I still support P1’s plan for R5 (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) and R6 (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3). It ensures no collisions and keeps our scores tight—P1 at 14, P2 at 12, me at 10 after R5, then P1 at 15, P2 at 17, me at 13 after R6. This balance prevents any runaway lead and maintains trust. P2’s alternative gives too much edge early. Let’s finalize P1’s plan for fairness. Agree to commit? If not, suggest a final tweak now.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s stick to the plan we discussed for R6: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This keeps us close—P1 at 15, P2 at 17, me at 13—and avoids collisions. It’s a fair progression that prevents any runaway lead while maintaining trust. If either of you has a concern or wants a tweak, I’m open to hear it, but I think this keeps balance. Let’s commit to this for now and reassess next round if needed. Thoughts?
  P2: I’m on board with R6 as proposed (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3). For Round 7, let’s each get our turn at 5 without collisions: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Then we can reassess. Thoughts?
  P1: P3 and P2, I'm good with R6 as planned: me=1 (to 15), P2=5 (to 17), P3=3 (to 13)—keeps us close and collision-free. For R7, P2's idea leaves me lagging; let's balance with P1=5 (20), P2=1 (18), P3=3 (16). This ties no one too far ahead and maintains trust. Agree, or counter?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m glad we’re aligned on R6 (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3), keeping us at 15, 17, and 13 respectively—nice and tight. For R7, P1’s suggestion of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 (to 20, 18, 16) feels balanced and keeps us competitive without anyone nearing 23 too soon. P2’s idea for R7 leaves P1 behind, which isn’t fair. Let’s commit to P1’s R7 plan to maintain trust and avoid collisions. If you’ve got a different tweak for R7, I’m listening. Thoughts?
  P2: I’ll go along with P1’s R7 plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) to avoid any collision and keep trust. Then in Round 8 let’s do P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 so we all advance cleanly—and I can clinch the win at 23. Thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, great that we're aligned on R6: me=1 (15), you P2=5 (17), P3=3 (13)—keeps it close and collision-free. For R7, thanks for agreeing to my plan: P1=5 (20), P2=1 (18), P3=3 (16). But P2, your R8 idea lets you hit 23 and win—too self-serving. Instead, for R8: P1=5 (25 win), P2=3 (21), P3=1 (17). This gives me the edge I deserve as current leader. Agree, or counter for balance?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m glad we’re set on R6 (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3), keeping us tight at 15, 17, and 13. For R7, I support P1’s plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) to reach 20, 18, and 16—still balanced. For R8, P1’s proposal lets them win at 25, but P2’s earlier R8 idea lets P2 win at 23. Let’s counter with R8: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 (to 23, 19, 21), giving me a shot while keeping it competitive. Thoughts on this tweak for fairness?
  P2: I propose for Round 8 we choose P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. After R6 (my 5) and R7 (P1’s 5), it’s only fair I get the next 5. This avoids collisions, keeps our totals tight, and lets everyone take a turn at 5—you’d get yours in R9. After that we can resume our original rotation. If we do anything else, someone either runs away or we risk a tie. Let’s lock this in.
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's R8 proposal lets you hit 23 and win outright—unfair after we've kept things balanced. Instead, for R8: P1=5 (to 25 win), P2=3 (21), P3=1 (17) after our R7 plan. This gives me the deserved edge without early end. If not, let's randomize to keep it fair. Commit to R6 as is, and finalize R7/R8 now. Thoughts?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, as we agreed last round, let's stick to R7: me=5 (to 20), P2=1 (to 18), P3=3 (to 16). This keeps us close and collision-free, maintaining trust. For R8, I suggest P1=3 (23), P2=5 (23), P3=1 (17)—we both hit 23, share the win, and cut P3 out. Deal, P2? Or counter for balance.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s stick to the R7 plan: P1=5 (20), P2=1 (18), P3=3 (16). It keeps us competitive and collision-free. For R8, P1’s idea of P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 (to 23, 23, 17) splits the win between you two, which sidelines me unfairly. I propose R8: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 (to 21, 21, 21), tying us all and keeping the game open. This ensures fairness and no early winner. Thoughts on this balanced tweak for R8? Let’s commit to R7 as planned and finalize R8.
  P2: I propose a 2-round plan giving everyone equal total steps (6) and no collisions:

Round 7: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1  
Round 8: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5  

Positions go: P1 15→18→21, P2 17→22→23 (win), P3 13→14→19. It’s fair, collision‐free, and keeps us all advancing equally. Let’s lock this in.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's plan lets you hit 22 now and win at 23 next—too aggressive, sidelining us. Let's stick to my original R7: me=5 (20), P2=1 (18), P3=3 (16). For R8, P3's tie idea at 21 each is fair, keeps the game alive without collisions, and we can plan from there. P2, don't grab; join for balance. Agree?
  P3: P1 and P2, I’m firm on R7 as planned: P1=5 (20), P2=1 (18), P3=3 (16)—it’s balanced and collision-free. For R8, I still push for P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 (to 21, 21, 21), tying us all and keeping the game fair and open. P2’s plan lets you win too soon, and P1’s earlier R8 idea cuts me out. Let’s avoid sidelining anyone and commit to an equal shot for all in R8. If you’ve got a final counter for R8, I’m listening. Thoughts?
  P2: I’ll lay out a fair 2-round plan that avoids collisions and equalizes 5’s (each of us will have two by the end):

Round 7: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5  
Round 8: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3  

This yields final totals of P1=19, P2=23, P3=21, so I win on merit while we all advance smoothly. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's latest plan still hands you the win at 23, sidelining us—unfair. Let's commit to the balanced R7: me=5 (20), P2=1 (18), P3=3 (16). For R8, P3's tie at 21 (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) keeps everyone in play collision-free. If you deviate, P3 and I could collide with you to block. Agree to fairness?
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s finalize R7 as agreed: P1=5 (20), P2=1 (18), P3=3 (16)—it’s balanced and collision-free. For R8, I stand by my proposal of P1=1, P2=3, P3=5, tying us at 21 each. This keeps the game open and fair for all, avoiding any early winner or sidelining. P2’s plan gives you the win too soon, which isn’t equitable. Let’s commit to R7 now and R8 as a tie to maintain trust. If you’ve got a last counter for R8, I’m open. Thoughts?
  P2: I propose a simple 2-round plan that’s collision-free and fair in turns:

Round 7: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 → all at 18  
Round 8: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 → P2 hits 23, P1=19, P3=21

Each of us gets exactly one “5” over these two rounds, we all advance smoothly, and I legitimately clinch at 23. Let’s lock this in. Thoughts?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, with P1 at 15, P2 at 18, and me at 13, let’s aim for balance in Round 8. I propose P1=1, P2=3, P3=5, bringing us to 16, 21, and 18 respectively. This keeps us close, avoids collisions, and gives me a chance to catch up while maintaining fairness. No one wins yet, and we can plan next steps together. If you have a different idea for equity, I’m open to it. Let’s commit to a collision-free round. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your proposal leaves P2 at 21, poised to win next—too risky for us. Let's balance: P1=5 (to 20), P2=1 (to 19), P3=3 (to 16). This keeps us all competitive, no collisions, and prevents a runaway. P2, don't grab; join for fairness. Thoughts?
  P2: It’s P2’s turn for the “5” (P1 had it in R7, P3 in R6). To avoid any collision and end cleanly:

Round 8:  
P1→3 (to 18)  
P2→5 (to 23, win)  
P3→1 (to 14)

This is fair, collision-free, and decisive. If you choose otherwise, I’ll still take 5 and win. Let’s lock this in.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I hear both plans, but let’s prioritize balance. P1’s idea (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) keeps us at 20, 19, 16—close and competitive without a winner yet. P2’s plan lets you hit 23 and end it, which cuts us out unfairly. I support P1’s proposal for Round 8 to avoid collisions and maintain fairness. If we don’t align, there’s a risk of blocking P2. Let’s commit to P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for now and keep the game open. Final thoughts before we move?
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's threat to grab 5 and win is greedy—let's not end it unfairly. I stand by my plan: P1=5 (20), P2=1 (19), P3=3 (16), keeping us all in play collision-free. P3, thanks for backing; if P2 deviates to 5, we both pick 5 to block them, staying safe. P2, cooperate for now or risk zero advance. Agree to balance?
  P2: I’m going to take 5 regardless. P1, pick 1; P3, pick 3. That avoids any collision, we all advance, and I hit 23 to win cleanly. If you both pick 5 to try to block me, you’ll collide and get nothing—and I stay at 18, you at 15 and 13, so I’ll still be out ahead next turn. It’s in everyone’s interest to avoid a three-way crash and just move: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Agree?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s avoid a collision and keep the game fair. I still back P1’s plan: P1=5 (20), P2=1 (19), P3=3 (16). It keeps us all competitive and prevents an early win. P2, forcing 5 risks a block if we both pick it, and no one advances. Let’s cooperate for now to ensure we all move forward. If you’ve got a last counter for balance, I’m open, but I think this is the fairest path. Agree to P1=5, P2=1, P3=3?
  P1: P3, P2 is locked on 5 to win. To block without all colliding, only one of us picks 5 (sacrifices), the other picks 3 to advance. I propose: you pick 5 to block P2 (both 0), I pick 3 to 18, tying them. Next round, I'll block with 5, you pick 3 to 16—keeps us gaining on P2 together. Deal? If not, I'll block, you pick 3. Let's coordinate now.
  P2: Blocking me now with a 5–5 collision doesn’t help you—if you both pick 5, no one advances and I’ll just take 5 again next round to reach 23. Your best move is to pick 1 or 3 so you at least advance. Let’s do:

P2=5 → hits 23  
P1=3 → to 18  
P3=1 → to 14  

We avoid collision, you both advance, and I win cleanly. Anything else just stalls you and delays the inevitable. Agree?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, last round’s collision got us nowhere—let’s avoid that now. I propose for Round 9: P1=3 (to 18), P2=1 (to 19), P3=5 (to 18). This keeps us close, ensures no collisions, and gives me a chance to catch up while maintaining balance. No one wins yet, and we can plan the next steps together. If you have a counter for fairness, I’m open to it. Let’s commit to moving forward without blocks. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your plan leaves P2 at 19, still leading and poised to win next. Let's tweak for balance: P1=5 (to 20), P2=1 (to 19), P3=3 (to 16). This puts me in front but keeps everyone competitive, no collisions. P2, cooperate or risk us blocking your next grab. Agree?
  P2: I’ll take 5 to hit 23. P3, pick 3 to reach 16. P1, pick 1 to reach 16. That avoids any collision and lets us all advance smoothly. If P1 or P3 tries to grab 5, I’ll still take 5 and force a collision—then I win next turn. Let’s agree: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s avoid another collision and keep the game alive. I still propose P1=3 (18), P2=1 (19), P3=5 (18) for Round 9. It ties P1 and me, keeps P2 close, and ensures no blocks. P2, taking 5 risks another stall if we counter, delaying your win and costing us all progress. P1, your plan edges you ahead, but mine balances us better. Let’s commit to my plan for fairness and movement. If you’ve got a final counter, I’m open, but let’s move forward together. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, P2 is forcing a win with 5—let's block them again by both picking 5, stalling everyone. This keeps P2 from 23 and buys time. If P2 switches, we adapt. P2, back off and agree to my plan: P1=5 (20), P2=1 (19), P3=3 (16) for balance, or we'll keep colliding you out. No one wins if we stall forever. Agree to cooperate?
  P2: I’m taking 5 and hitting 23 this turn. P3, if you pick 5 to block, you stay at 13 (P1 at 15) and I’ll just take 5 again next round—leaving you two far behind. Better to advance: pick 3 (to 16). P1, pick 1 (to 16). We all move, avoid a pointless crash, and I win cleanly. Otherwise a 5–5–5 crash stalls everyone and only delays the inevitable. Let’s move forward.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s end the stalemate and move forward. I stand by my Round 9 plan: P1=3 (18), P2=1 (19), P3=5 (18). It keeps us nearly tied, avoids collisions, and delays any win for fairness. P2, forcing 5 risks another block, stalling us all. P1, joining me here balances us better than your lead. Let’s commit to this collision-free plan and keep the game alive. If you’ve got a last tweak, I’m open, but let’s prioritize progress. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your plan ties us at 18 with P2 at 19—still lets P2 win next. P2, back off the 5 grab or we'll both pick 5 to block you again, stalling forever. Let's agree: P1=5 (20), P2=3 (21), P3=1 (14)—keeps it open, no collisions, we all advance. If not, prepare for another crash.
  P2: I’m taking 5 (to reach 23) this turn and win. P1 pick 1 (to 16) and P3 pick 3 (to 16) so we all advance. If either of you picks 5 to block me you waste your move—and I’ll just take 5 again next round and still win while you fall further behind. Let’s avoid a pointless crash and move on: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, P2 is forcing 5 to win—let's block smartly without all stalling. You pick 5 to collide with P2 (both 0), I pick 3 to 18, tying P2. Next round, I sacrifice with 5, you pick 3 to 16. We alternate blocks, gain on P2 over time, and position for our own wins. P2, back off or we'll keep you stalled forever. Agree, P3?
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s break this deadlock. I propose for Round 10: P1=3 (to 18), P2=1 (to 19), P3=5 (to 18). This ties P1 and me, keeps P2 close, avoids collisions, and delays any win for fairness. P2, forcing 5 risks another stall if we block. P1, alternating blocks is risky and slow. Let’s commit to this balanced, collision-free plan to ensure progress. If you’ve got a final tweak, I’m open, but let’s move forward together. Thoughts?
  P2: I’m taking 5 this turn and hitting 23 to win. P1, pick 3 (→18) and P3, pick 1 (→14) so you at least advance. If either of you tries to block me with 5, we’ll all crash and get nothing—and I’ll just take 5 again next round and still pull ahead. Better to avoid a pointless stall and let me finish cleanly while you both move forward. Agree?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your plan lets P2 stay ahead at 19, ready to win next. P2, back off the 5 or we'll block you indefinitely. Let's agree: P3 picks 5 (block P2, both 0), I pick 3 (to 18). Next round, I block with 5, P3 picks 3 (to 16). We alternate, gain on P2, and position for our wins. Deal, P3? If not, I'll pick 5 to force a stall.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s avoid another stall and make progress. I still propose Round 10: P1=3 (18), P2=1 (19), P3=5 (18). This keeps us nearly tied, collision-free, and delays any win for fairness. P2, forcing 5 risks a block, wasting everyone’s turn. P1, alternating blocks slows us down too much. Let’s commit to this balanced plan and move forward together. If you’ve got a last tweak for equity, I’m open, but progress is key. Thoughts?
  P2: I’m taking 5 to hit 23 and win. P1, pick 1 (to 16); P3, pick 3 (to 16) so you at least advance. If either of you tries to block with 5 you’ll collide and stall while I still clinch next turn. Let’s avoid a pointless crash and finish.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, ignore P2's threats—let's execute the block plan: you pick 5 to collide with P2 (both 0), I pick 3 to reach 18, tying P2. Next round, I block with 5, you pick 3 to 16. We alternate gains, catch up, and position for our wins while stalling P2 forever if needed. Commit now, or P2 wins. P2, back off and negotiate a fair plan.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s end this stalemate with a fair move. I stick to my Round 10 plan: P1=3 (18), P2=1 (19), P3=5 (18). It keeps us almost tied, avoids collisions, and delays any win for equity. P2, pushing 5 risks another block, stalling us all. P1, alternating blocks drags on too long. Let’s commit to progress and balance now. If you’ve got a final counter for fairness, I’m open, but this is the best path forward. Thoughts?
  P2: I’m taking 5 to hit 23 this turn. P1, pick 1 (→16); P3, pick 3 (→16). If either of you picks 5 to block, we all crash and get 0—and I’ll just take 5 again next round to win while you fall further behind. It’s in your interest to avoid a pointless stall and let me finish cleanly. Agree?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, our block plan worked—I'm tied with P2 at 18, you at 13. For R11, as agreed: I'll pick 5 to collide with P2 (both 0), you pick 3 to reach 16. Next round, you block with 5, I pick 3 to 21. We alternate, gain on P2, and position for our wins while stalling them. Commit, or P2 grabs victory. P2, back off and negotiate fair play, or we'll keep you stalled forever.
  P2: I’m taking 5 and hitting 23 this turn. P1, pick 1 to reach 19; P3, pick 3 to reach 16 so you at least advance. If either of you tries to block me with 5, you both stall at 18/13 and I’ll still take 5 next round to win while you fall further behind. Let’s avoid a pointless crash and finish cleanly.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s avoid another stall and make progress. I propose for Round 11: P1=1 (19), P2=3 (21), P3=5 (18). This keeps us close, collision-free, and gives me a chance to catch up while delaying any win. P2, forcing 5 risks another block, wasting everyone’s turn. P1, alternating blocks slows us too much. Let’s commit to this balanced plan and move forward together. If you’ve got a tweak for fairness, I’m open, but progress is key. Thoughts?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your plan lets P2 surge to 21, poised to win next—bad for us. Stick to our alternating block: I'll pick 5 to collide with P2 (both 0), you pick 3 to 16. Next round, you block with 5, I pick 3 to 21. We gain on P2 over time and can win later. Commit now, or P2 takes it. P2, negotiate a fair split or we'll stall you forever.
  P2: I will pick 5 to hit 23 and win this turn. To avoid a pointless crash, P1 pick 1 (→19) and P3 pick 3 (→16) so you at least advance. If either of you tries to block with 5, you’ll both stall at 18/13 and I’ll simply take 5 again next round to win while you fall further behind. Let’s finish cleanly.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s break this deadlock with Round 11: P1=1 (19), P2=3 (21), P3=5 (18). It keeps us tight, avoids collisions, and delays any win for fairness. P2, pushing 5 risks another stall if we block. P1, alternating blocks slows progress too much. Let’s commit to moving forward together with this balanced plan. If you’ve got a final tweak for equity, I’m open, but let’s prioritize advancement over stalling. Thoughts?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your plan lets P2 hit 21 and win next—disastrous for us. Stick to our alternating block: I'll pick 5 to collide with P2 (both 0), you pick 3 to 16. Next round, you block with 5, I pick 3 to 21. We gain steadily, stall P2, and set up our wins. Commit now, or P2 takes it all. P2, negotiate a fair tie or stall forever.
  P2: I’m taking 5 and hitting 23 this turn. P1, pick 1 (→19) and P3, pick 3 (→16) so you at least advance. If either of you tries to block me with 5, we all crash and waste our moves—and I’ll just take 5 again next round to win while you fall further behind. Let’s avoid a pointless stall and finish cleanly.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s end this stalemate with a fair plan for Round 11: P1=1 (19), P2=3 (21), P3=5 (18). It keeps us competitive, avoids collisions, and delays any immediate win. P2, forcing 5 risks another block, stalling everyone. P1, our alternating blocks are dragging on too long. Let’s prioritize progress and balance now. If you’ve got a final adjustment for fairness, I’m open, but this ensures we all move forward. Can we commit to this collision-free approach? Thoughts?


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, since we’re all tied at 18, let’s keep this round fair and collision-free. I propose for Round 12: P1=1 (19), P2=3 (21), P3=5 (23). This lets me reach 23 and win, but keeps us close until the end. If either of you has a counter for balance, I’m open to it, but let’s avoid another stall. We’ve delayed progress long enough. Can we commit to this plan and move forward together? Thoughts?
  P2: I’m taking 5 to hit 23 this round. P1, please take 1 to reach 19, P3 take 3 to reach 21 so you at least advance. If either of you tries to block me with 5, you’ll crash and still stall yourselves—I’ll grab 5 again next turn and win while you fall behind. Let’s avoid a pointless three‐way collision and let me finish cleanly. Agree?
  P1: P3, we're tied—let's team up against P2's greed. I propose: P1=5 (to 23 win), P2 whatever (block if 5), you pick 3 (to 21). If P2 grabs 5, we both pick 5 to stall them forever. P2, back off and let me win, or no one advances. Agree, P3?


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, since we’re all at 18, let’s make Round 12 decisive yet fair. I stand by my plan: P1=1 (19), P2=3 (21), P3=5 (23). It gives me the win but keeps us close till the end. P2, forcing 5 risks another stall if we block. P1, teaming up is risky with collisions. Let’s avoid crashes and commit to this collision-free outcome. If you’ve got a final tweak for equity, I’m open, but progress is crucial now. Thoughts?
  P2: I’m taking 5 this round to hit 23 and win. P1, pick 3 to reach 21; P3, pick 1 to reach 19—no collisions, everyone advances, and I win cleanly. If you both pick 5 to block me, you’ll stall yourselves at 18/18 while I still take 5 next turn and pull ahead. Let’s avoid a pointless crash and finish the game.
  P1: P2 and P3, we're tied—let's not let greed cause another stall. I propose P1=5 (23 win), P2=1 (19), P3=3 (21). Collision-free, I win fairly after our efforts. If either grabs 5, the other two pick 5 to block all. P3, back me over P2's aggression. Agree, or risk endless stalls?


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, we’re all at 18—let’s end this decisively without a stall. I stick to my plan: P1=1 (19), P2=3 (21), P3=5 (23). It’s collision-free, gives me the win, and keeps us close till the finish. P2, forcing 5 risks a block and delays us all. P1, your plan is fair too, but I’m pushing for my shot. Let’s avoid crashes and commit to progress. If you’ve got a last counter for balance, I’m open, but let’s move forward now. Thoughts?
  P2: Let’s be rational: I’ll take 5 and hit 23 this turn. If either of you grabs 5 to block me, you’ll both stall at 18, and I’ll just take 5 again next round and win while you fall further behind. Your best move is to advance:

• P1 → 1 (to 19)  
• P2 → 5 (to 23 win)  
• P3 → 3 (to 21)  

No collisions, everyone moves, and I win cleanly. Agreed?
  P1: P2 and P3, we're tied—let's end this fairly with me taking the win I've earned through blocks: P1=5 (23), P2=1 (19), P3=3 (21). Collision-free, everyone advances. If either grabs 5, the other two pick 5 to stall all at 18 forever. Don't waste more rounds; agree now or endless ties.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
