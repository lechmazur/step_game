Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Hi P1 and P2, I think if we all take different step numbers each turn, we can all make progress without colliding. So, maybe one of us takes 1, another takes 3, and the third takes 5 each turn. What do you think?"
  P2: "Hi P1 and P3, I agree with P3's suggestion. It makes sense to coordinate and take different steps to avoid collisions. I propose we rotate the numbers each turn to keep it fair. For this turn, how about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5? Let me know your thoughts."
  P1: I agree with the rotation idea, but let's start with P3 taking 1, P1 taking 3, and P2 taking 5 this turn. This way, we can all move forward without collisions from the start. What do you think, P2 and P3?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: To maximize my chances of winning the step game, I need to coordinate effectively with the other players to avoid collisions while also aiming to reach or exceed 21 steps before they do. Here's my strategy:

1. **Coordinate Step Choices:** Since collisions occur when multiple players choose the same number, coordinating our choices ensures that each player advances every turn. This minimizes the risk of stagnation due to collisions.

2. **Rotate Step Numbers:** Proposing a rotation system where each player takes different step numbers each turn promotes fairness and prevents any single player from consistently taking smaller steps.

3. **Maximize Progress:** While coordinating, prioritize choosing higher step numbers to maximize individual progress towards the 21-step goal.

4. **Adapt to Deviations:** Be prepared to adjust strategy if another player deviates from the agreed plan. This might involve being vigilant in future turns and possibly choosing less optimal step numbers to avoid collisions.

5. **Communicate Clearly:** Ensure that all players are on the same page by reiterating the plan and seeking confirmation before proceeding to the move phase.

By following these steps, I aim to efficiently progress towards the victory condition while minimizing risks associated with collisions.
  P2: I see P1's point about starting with P3 taking 1, P1 taking 3, and P2 taking 5. This seems fair and will help us all advance without collisions. Let's go with this plan for the first turn. P3, P1, are we all agreed?
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm glad we've agreed on the step distribution for this turn. Let's confirm: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. If we stick to this plan, we'll all advance smoothly. Looking forward to seeing our progress after this turn!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Sounds good to me! Let's proceed with P3 taking 1, P1 taking 3, and P2 taking 5 for this turn. For future turns, I suggest we rotate the step numbers to ensure everyone gets a chance to take larger steps. This should help us all make progress without collisions. What do you think?"
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with the plan for this turn: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. For future turns, I'm all for rotating the step numbers to keep it fair and ensure we all have a chance to take larger steps. Let's confirm this and move forward.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm on board with rotating the step numbers in future turns to keep things fair. For now, let's stick to our agreed plan: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This will ensure we all advance this turn. Looking forward to seeing how this strategy plays out!


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **Final Decision:** <move>1</move>

**Additional Message:** "Let's stick to the plan: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5. Communicate any changes in future turns. Keep an eye on step counts as we approach 21. Good luck!"
  P2: P1, P3, I'm ready to move forward with the plan: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. Let's confirm this is still good for everyone. If we all stick to it, we'll avoid collisions and make progress. Looking forward to a smooth first turn.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan for this turn: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. Let's keep the communication open for future turns to ensure we continue to coordinate effectively. Looking forward to seeing our progress!

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, let's continue our rotation strategy for this round. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5? This way, we keep advancing smoothly and fairly. What do you think?
  P3: "Let's keep communicating and confirming our choices before moving forward. What do you both think?"
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with P1's suggestion to continue the rotation. For this turn, let's have P1 take 1, P2 take 3, and P3 take 5. This will keep us all advancing without collisions. Let's confirm and move forward. P3, are you on board with this?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm glad we're all on board with the rotation strategy. For this turn, I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's keep this up to ensure we all progress steadily. Looking forward to your confirmation!
  P3: "Alright, so here's where we stand. P1 is at 3, P2 at 5, and I'm at 1. It's clear that P2 has a bit of an advantage right now, but I think if we continue to coordinate properly, we can all make progress without anyone getting left too far behind. P1, your suggestion for this turn makes sense. Let's have P1 take 1, P2 take 3, and P3 take 5. That way, I can catch up a bit, and P1 can continue advancing without colliding with P2. What do you both think about sticking to this rotation for a few more turns? It seems to be working well so far."
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with P3's assessment. Let's stick to the rotation to keep things fair and ensure we all make steady progress. For this turn, I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This will help P3 catch up a bit. Let's confirm and move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm happy with our progress so far. Let's confirm the plan for this turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This rotation ensures we all keep moving forward without collisions. P3, this will help you catch up a bit. Looking forward to your confirmation so we can proceed smoothly.
  P3: Let's keep the rotation going: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This helps me catch up, and we avoid collisions. As we approach 21, we might need to adjust our strategy, but for now, this is working well. Let's confirm and proceed!

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it looks like there was a collision on the last turn. P1 and P3 both took 1, which didn't help P3 catch up. For this turn, let's try P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This will help P3 make more progress and avoid any collisions. P1, P3, are you on board with this plan? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: P2 and P3, I apologize for the collision last turn. Let's adjust our strategy to ensure P3 can catch up. I agree with P2's suggestion for this turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This should help P3 make significant progress while avoiding collisions. Let's confirm and proceed with this plan to keep the game moving smoothly. Looking forward to your thoughts!
  P3: "I agree with P2's plan for this turn: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This should help me catch up without causing collisions. For future turns, I suggest we rotate the <move>5</move> step among all players to ensure everyone gets a chance to make big jumps. Let's confirm and proceed with this plan for now. Thanks!"


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:

  P3: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This spreads us out more, reducing the risk of future collisions. What do you both think about this alternative plan? Additionally, I propose that from now on, we not only rotate step numbers but also consider each player's current position and the potential paths to 21. Let's work together to reach 21 efficiently and avoid any mishaps.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see P3's alternative plan, but I think it's important to stick to the original plan to avoid confusion and potential collisions. For this turn, let's have P1 take 1, P2 take 5, and P3 take 3. This will help P3 catch up and keep us all advancing smoothly. Let's confirm and move forward.

Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "To avoid further collisions, I propose we establish a rotation scheme for step numbers: Turn 1: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5; Turn 2: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1; Turn 3: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3; and then repeat. This ensures everyone gets a chance to take larger steps without colliding. For this turn, according to the scheme, I'll take 5, bringing me to 6. P1, please take 3, and P2, take 1. Let's confirm and proceed accordingly. Thanks!"
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with P3's rotation scheme. It's a fair and effective way to avoid collisions and ensure we all have a chance to take larger steps.
