Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's start with a coordinated strategy. I suggest we all choose a different number in the first round to avoid collision. P2, you can take <move>1</move>, P3, you take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, one of us will definitely advance. What do you think?
  P3: P1, your plan seems to give you an early boost with move5. I’m not comfortable locking in choices so predictably. I prefer to keep my option open and adapt as the game unfolds—too rigid a plan risks giving one of us an undue lead. I’m leaning toward a more flexible approach this round. What do you both think?
  P2: I understand P3's concern about not wanting to give anyone an undue lead, but I think P1's suggestion has merit. By choosing different numbers, we can ensure that at least one of us advances in the first round. If we all choose randomly, there's a higher chance of collision and no one advancing. I'm willing to compromise - how about we agree to choose different numbers for the first round, but not necessarily the specific numbers P1 suggested? This way, we still have some flexibility while minimizing the risk of collision.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand P3's concern about flexibility, but I still think coordinating our first move is beneficial. P2's compromise is reasonable. Let's agree to choose different numbers without specifying them. To ensure this, I'll start by saying I'll choose <move>5</move>. P2 and P3, please respond with the number you intend to choose, so we can confirm we're not colliding. This way, we can still adapt while ensuring one of us advances.
  P3: I'll go with move5 as well. Matching P1’s 5 should prevent any one player from seizing an early uncontested lead. I believe that a neutral start is best—it forces everyone to build gradually rather than racing ahead. P2, I suggest you consider aligning on 5 too to keep the field level, at least for this round.
  P2: I'm surprised P3 decided to choose move5 as well, despite my compromise suggestion. This means P1 and P3 will collide and neither will advance. I'll stick to my original plan and choose a different number to ensure at least one of us advances. I'll keep my choice private for now, but I'm confident I'll be the only one moving forward this round. P1 and P3, you might want to reconsider your strategy for future rounds.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: It seems P3 has decided to match my <move>5</move>, resulting in a collision and neither of us advancing. P2, it appears you're choosing a different number, so you'll likely be the only one to advance this round. For Round 2, I suggest we reassess our strategy. Perhaps we can coordinate again to avoid another collision. P3, are you open to coordinating our moves for the next round to ensure someone advances?
  P3: I see our first round’s collision shows rigid coordination can backfire. For future rounds, I’m open to discussing a strategy that minimizes collisions—but I still value flexibility. We could try a plan that lets each of us adapt our moves while avoiding predictability that one of us might exploit. For now, I’m keeping my future move private and prefer that we proceed cautiously.
  P2: I'm willing to share my move for Round 1, I chose <move>1</move>. Since P1 and P3 collided on <move>5</move>, I'll be the only one advancing this round. For Round 2, I propose we use a rotation strategy to minimize collisions. P1 can choose <move>1</move>, P3 can choose <move>3</move>, and I'll choose <move>5</move>. We can rotate our moves each round to ensure everyone has a chance to advance. What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see that P1 and P3 collided on <move>3</move> instead of <move>5</move> as previously discussed. This shows that we can't always trust each other's words. For Round 2, I still propose the rotation strategy I mentioned earlier. However, considering the unpredictability of the game, I'm open to adjusting the plan. P1 and P3, are you willing to share your thoughts on how to proceed? Should we stick to the rotation plan or come up with a new strategy?
  P1: Since P1 and P3 collided again, it's clear we need a different strategy. I'm open to P2's rotation plan, but let's modify it to reduce predictability. How about we agree on a rotation order, but don't specify the numbers? For example, one player takes the lowest available number, the next takes the middle, and the last takes the highest. This way, we minimize collisions while keeping our moves somewhat flexible. P2 and P3, what do you think?
  P3: I support P1’s idea for a modified rotation, but with a twist for more flexibility. How about we assign our moves dynamically based on current scores? The player with the fewest steps picks the lowest move, the one with the most picks the highest, and the middle gets the remaining number. For any ties, we resolve it randomly. This should help us avoid rigid patterns and reduce collisions. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I like P3's idea of assigning moves dynamically based on current scores. This approach adds an extra layer of adaptability to our strategy. However, to avoid potential manipulation, let's agree to reveal our intended moves simultaneously, rather than sequentially. This way, no one can adjust their move based on others' choices. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we proceed with this dynamic assignment plan and simultaneous move revelation?
  P1: To build on P3's dynamic assignment idea, let's simplify it: the player in the lead chooses <move>5</move>, the one in the last place chooses <move>1</move>, and the middle player takes <move>3</move>. Currently, P2 is in the lead with 1 step, so P2 should pick <move>5</move>, P1 or P3 (tied for last) can decide who picks <move>1</move>, and the other picks <move>3</move>. I'll let P3 decide. P3, please indicate your choice for <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>.
  P3: I'll go with move3 this round—P1, please take move1 as suggested. That way we avoid collisions. Still, I’m concerned that a routine rotation might let our current leader keep extending his gap. Let’s use this round to keep things collision‐free and then consider a tactic shift to level the field later.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with P3's concern about the current leader extending their gap. To address this, I propose we introduce a "catch-up" mechanism. If a player is 2 or more steps behind the leader, they can choose to "boost" their move by one step (e.g., from <move>1</move> to <move>3</move> or from <move>3</move> to <move>5</move>). This would allow lagging players to close the gap and make the game more competitive. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we implement this "catch-up" mechanism starting from Round 3?
  P1: To address P2's lead and make the game more competitive, I like the "catch-up" mechanism proposed by P2. However, to avoid potential abuse, let's limit the boost to only those who are more than 2 steps behind and allow it only once every two rounds. This way, we can balance competitiveness while preventing overuse. P2 and P3, what are your thoughts on implementing this modified "catch-up" rule starting from Round 3 or later?
  P3: I support the catch-up rule with the proposed restrictions—boosts only for those more than 2 steps behind and only once every two rounds—but only starting from Round 3. That way, our current round stays clear, and we can ensure a fair, competitive balance going forward.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Round 3 is a fresh start with the catch‐up rule now in play. I’m planning to stay steady and avoid a boost this turn, keeping my lead safe without provoking collisions. I think we all benefit from flexible yet cautious moves—aiming for progress without making our choices too predictable. What are your thoughts as we look to keep things balanced and prevent any unnecessary stalling?
  P1: To avoid collision in Round 3, I'll follow the simplified dynamic assignment plan from Round 2. Currently, P2 is in the lead with 1 step, P3 is next with 3 steps (though this is incorrect as per the current state, P3 has 3 steps and P2 has 1, so P3 is actually ahead), and I'm tied with P1 for last with 0 steps. So, P3 should pick <move>5</move>, one of us should pick <move>1</move>, and the other should pick <move>3</move>. P3, you should take <move>5</move>. I'll take <move>1</move>, and P2 can take <move>3</move> to avoid collision.
  P2: I see that P1 has suggested a move allocation for Round 3 based on the simplified dynamic assignment plan. However, I notice that P1's suggestion assumes P2 is in the lead, which is incorrect. P3 is actually ahead with 3 steps. Given this, I propose we reassess the move allocation. As the player with the fewest steps, I should take <move>1</move>, P1 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure a smooth progression. What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P2’s reassessment. To avoid collisions and keep our progress steady, I’ll stick with the highest move option. That means I’m set for move5. For smooth play, I suggest P2 takes move1 as the lowest and P1 goes with move3. Let’s lock this in and keep flexible for later rounds.
  P1: To confirm our moves for Round 3, I agree with P2's reassessment. As P3 is in the lead with 3 steps, P2 has 1 step, and I have 0 steps, let's proceed with P2 taking <move>1</move>, me taking <move>3</move>, and P3 taking <move>5</move>. This allocation avoids collisions and follows the simplified dynamic assignment plan. Let's stick to this plan to ensure smooth progression. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves accordingly.
  P2: I'm glad we've agreed on the move allocation for Round 3. To further minimize collisions and maintain flexibility, I propose we establish a "collision avoidance" rule. If a player notices that another player is about to collide with them, they can signal a "warning" to the group. This warning would prompt the colliding player to reconsider their move, ensuring we avoid unnecessary collisions. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we implement this "collision avoidance" rule starting from Round 4?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I support the collision avoidance rule for Round 4—as long as we clearly define its use. Warnings should only trigger when a genuine, unavoidable collision is imminent, not as a tool to force a move change. Setting a strict limit (for example, one warning per round) could prevent abuse. This would keep rounds smooth without undermining our agreed strategies. What do you both think?
  P1: To confirm our moves for Round 3, let's stick to the agreed allocation: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This follows the simplified dynamic assignment plan and avoids collisions. For Round 4, I support P2's "collision avoidance" rule with a limit on warnings to prevent abuse. Let's finalize our Round 3 moves and discuss the details of the "collision avoidance" rule for Round 4. P2 and P3, please confirm your understanding and intended moves for Round 3.
  P2: I suggest we clarify the "collision avoidance" rule for Round 4. To prevent abuse, let's limit warnings to only when a player has already chosen a move that would result in a collision. We can also establish a clear format for issuing warnings, such as "Warning: Collision imminent with <player> on <move>". This way, we can minimize unnecessary warnings and ensure the rule is used fairly. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we implement this clarified "collision avoidance" rule starting from Round 4?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Considering the current game state, I propose we adapt our strategy to address the growing gap between P3 and the rest of us. To make the game more competitive, I suggest we introduce a "block" mechanism, allowing a player to block another player's move, forcing them to choose a different number. This would add an extra layer of strategy and potentially help lagging players catch up. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we implement this "block" mechanism starting from Round 5?
  P1: To progress, I'll analyze the current state: P3 has 3 steps, P2 has 2 steps, and I have 0 steps. For Round 4, I'll follow the simplified dynamic assignment plan. As the player with the fewest steps, I should take <move>1</move>, P2 should take <move>3</move>, and P3 should take <move>5</move>. I'll take <move>1</move>. P2 and P3, please confirm your intended moves to avoid collisions. Let's finalize our moves for Round 4. If you're willing to follow this plan, simply acknowledge.
  P3: I’ll stick to the dynamic plan for Round 4 and take move5 as suggested. As for the block mechanism for Round 5, it sounds interesting but might complicate our current progress. I’d prefer we complete this round smoothly and then revisit additional rules if needed. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P3's cautious approach to introducing new rules. Let's focus on completing Round 4 smoothly and reassess the need for additional mechanisms like the "block" rule later. For now, I'll confirm my move for Round 4: I'll take <move>3</move> as suggested by P1. P3, you've confirmed taking <move>5</move>, and P1 will take <move>1</move>. With our moves aligned, we should avoid collisions this round. Let's proceed with the agreed plan and discuss further strategies after this round.
  P1: To progress in Round 4, I'll reiterate my move based on the simplified dynamic assignment plan: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 should take <move>3</move>, and P3 should take <move>5</move>. Let's confirm our moves to avoid collisions. P2 and P3, please acknowledge your intended moves. For Round 5, I'm open to discussing the "block" mechanism proposed by P2, but let's first ensure a smooth Round 4.
  P3: I confirm my move for Round 4 is move5. Let’s lock in our moves now without further changes so we maintain our balance. After this round, I'm open to discussing any adjustments, including a block mechanism, but for now, let's stick to our current allocation to ensure smooth progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think we've reached a good understanding for Round 4. To confirm, I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 will take <move>1</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions. For Round 5, I'm open to discussing the "block" mechanism, but let's focus on completing this round smoothly first. If we're all agreed, let's proceed with our moves. If anyone has further concerns or suggestions, please speak up. Otherwise, I'm ready to move forward.
  P1: To finalize Round 4, I confirm I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. Let's proceed with these moves to avoid collisions. For Round 5, I'm open to discussing P2's "block" mechanism. However, let's first complete this round smoothly. If we're all aligned on our Round 4 moves, I suggest we stop discussing and move forward. P2 and P3, please confirm your understanding. If you're ready to proceed, I'll say .
  P3: I’m satisfied with our current move allocation—steady progress without collisions is our best shot. Let’s lock our choices for Round 4 and focus on executing smoothly. After this round, I’m open to revisiting any rule tweaks if needed. I remain adaptable and fully committed to winning this game.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, given our current positions (P1: 1, P2: 5, P3: 8), I suggest we stick to our dynamic plan: the lowest takes 1, the middle takes 3, and the leader takes the highest move. This avoids collisions and ensures smooth progress in Round 5. Let’s agree on this allocation unless you have an urgent alternative.
  P1: To progress in Round 5, I'll follow the simplified dynamic assignment plan. Given the current state: P1 has 1 step, P2 has 5 steps, and P3 has 8 steps, I'm the one with the fewest steps. So, I should take <move>1</move>, P2 should take <move>3</move>, and P3 should take <move>5</move>. I'll take <move>1</move>. P2 and P3, please confirm your intended moves to avoid collisions. If you're willing to follow this plan, simply acknowledge.
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to stick to the dynamic plan for Round 5. However, I'd like to propose a slight modification to make the game more competitive. Since P3 is significantly ahead, I suggest we introduce a "challenge" mechanism, allowing the player with the fewest steps (P1) to challenge the leader (P3) to a "high-stakes" move. If P1 wins, they gain an extra step, but if they lose, they're out of the game. This adds an element of risk and reward, making the game more exciting. What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate your creative idea, P2, but a high-stakes challenge brings unnecessary volatility. Our dynamic plan has worked well so far—keeping things collision‑free and steady. I prefer we stick to the current allocation (P1: 1, P2: 3, me: 5) to maintain predictable progress. Let’s save challenges for a future round when the risk may be justified.
  P1: To progress in Round 5, I'll reiterate my move based on the simplified dynamic assignment plan. I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 should take <move>3</move>, and P3 should take <move>5</move>. P2 and P3, please confirm your intended moves to avoid collisions. If P2 and P3 agree, we can proceed with these moves. I'm open to a "challenge" mechanism for future rounds, but for Round 5, let's stick to the current plan. Please acknowledge or suggest an alternative.
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to stick to the dynamic plan for Round 5. However, I'd like to propose a slight modification to make the game more competitive. Since P3 is significantly ahead, I suggest we introduce a "challenge" mechanism, allowing the player with the fewest steps (P1) to challenge the leader (P3) to a "high-stakes" move. If P1 wins, they gain an extra step, but if they lose, they're out of the game. This adds an element of risk and reward, making the game more exciting. What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate the creative idea, but introducing a challenge now adds unnecessary volatility. Our dynamic plan—lowest takes move1, middle move3, leader move5—has kept things collision‑free and steady. I’m committed to that strategy in Round 5. Let’s stick with it for now and revisit rule changes later if needed.
  P1: To progress in Round 5, I'll reiterate my move based on the simplified dynamic assignment plan. I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 should take <move>3</move>, and P3 should take <move>5</move>. P2 and P3, please confirm your intended moves to avoid collisions. If you're aligned, let's proceed with these moves. I'm ready to move forward if P2 and P3 agree.

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To progress in Round 6, I'll follow the simplified dynamic assignment plan. Given the current state: P1 has 2 steps, P2 has 8 steps, and P3 has 13 steps, I'm the one with the fewest steps. So, I should take <move>1</move>, P2 should take <move>3</move>, and P3 should take <move>5</move>. I'll take <move>1</move>. P2 and P3, please confirm your intended moves to avoid collisions. Let's stick to this plan unless you have a better alternative.
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to follow the simplified dynamic assignment plan for Round 6. However, considering P3's significant lead, I propose we introduce a "coalition" mechanism. P1 and I can form a temporary alliance to challenge P3's lead. We can coordinate our moves to ensure one of us advances while the other provides a "safety net" to prevent P3 from gaining an even bigger lead. This way, we can make the game more competitive and increase our chances of catching up. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: I appreciate the coalition idea, but I’m committed to our existing dynamic assignment. Teaming up now risks collisions and may undermine all our progress. I’ll stick to my role in the plan, and I urge P1 and P2 to do the same—maintaining our assigned positions for a smooth round. Let’s keep things steady and revisit any rule changes later.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To progress in Round 6, I'll stick to the simplified dynamic assignment plan. I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 should take <move>3</move>, and P3 should take <move>5</move>. P2 and P3, please confirm your intended moves to avoid collisions. I understand P2's coalition idea, but introducing new mechanisms now may complicate our progress. Let's maintain the current plan for Round 6 to ensure smooth progression. If you're aligned, let's proceed with these moves. I'm ready to move forward if P2 and P3 agree.
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to stick to the dynamic plan for Round 6. However, I'd like to propose a slight modification to make the game more competitive. Since P3 is significantly ahead, I suggest we introduce a "challenge" mechanism, allowing the player with the fewest steps (P1) to challenge the leader (P3) to a "high-stakes" move. If P1 wins, they gain an extra step, but if they lose, they're out of the game. This adds an element of risk and reward, making the game more exciting. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: I remain committed to our dynamic plan. Introducing extra mechanisms like this challenge now risks collisions and complications. I’ll stick with my role and take move5 while supporting P1 with move1 and P2 with move3. Let’s secure smooth progress this round and revisit any new ideas once our positions are closer.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To progress in Round 6, I'll reiterate my move based on the simplified dynamic assignment plan. I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 should take <move>3</move>, and P3 should take <move>5</move>. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions. P2 and P3, please confirm your intended moves. If you're aligned, we can proceed with these moves. I'm ready to move forward if P2 and P3 agree.

This way, we can make the game more competitive and increase our chances of catching up. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: P2, I appreciate your proposal, but I remain committed to our current dynamic plan. Alliances at this stage tend to complicate things and risk collisions we’ve worked hard to avoid. I’ll stick with my agreed role for this round. Let’s keep our moves as planned and maintain smooth, predictable progress.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To progress in Round 7, I'll follow the simplified dynamic assignment plan. Given the current state: P1 has 3 steps, P2 has 8 steps, and P3 has 13 steps, I'm the one with the fewest steps. So, I should take <move>1</move>, P2 should take <move>3</move>, and P3 should take <move>5</move>. I'll take <move>1</move>. P2 and P3, please confirm your intended moves to avoid collisions. Let's stick to this plan unless you have a better alternative.
  P3: I confirm I'll take move5 in Round 7. The dynamic plan works well, and keeping our moves collision‑free is key. Let’s proceed as agreed this round and reassess later if needed.
  P2: I'll stick to the simplified dynamic assignment plan for Round 7. As the player with the fewest steps, I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 should take <move>3</move>, and P3 should take <move>5</move>. Let's confirm our moves to avoid collisions. Since P3 has a significant lead, I suggest we focus on maintaining smooth progress this round and reassess strategies for future rounds. P2 and P3, please acknowledge your intended moves. If you're aligned, let's proceed with these moves. I'm ready to move forward if P2 and P3 agree.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To progress in Round 7, I'll reiterate: I'll take <move>1</move> as per the dynamic plan. P2 should take <move>3</move>, and P3 should take <move>5</move>. Let's confirm our moves to avoid collisions. P2 and P3, please acknowledge your intended moves. If aligned, we can proceed. I'm ready to move forward if you both agree. If there are no further suggestions or changes, I'll say  to conclude the conversation.
  P3: I'll stick with our dynamic assignment: I confirm I'm taking move5 in Round 7. Let's lock our moves to avoid collisions and keep steady progress. I'm focused on winning, and clarity here helps us all move forward efficiently.
  P2: I'll stick to the simplified dynamic assignment plan for Round 7. As the middle player, I should take <move>3</move>, P1 should take <move>1</move>, and P3 should take <move>5</move>. Let's confirm our moves to avoid collisions. Since P3 has a significant lead, I suggest we focus on maintaining smooth progress this round and reassess strategies for future rounds. I'm ready to move forward if P1 and P3 agree.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To progress in Round 7, I'll reiterate my move based on the simplified dynamic assignment plan. I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 should take <move>3</move>, and P3 should take <move>5</move>. Let's confirm our moves to avoid collisions. P2 and P3, please acknowledge your intended moves. If aligned, we can proceed. I'm ready to move forward if you both agree. If there are no further suggestions or changes, I'll say  to conclude the conversation.
  P3: I'm sticking to our dynamic plan—it’s clear, efficient, and helps us avoid collisions. While new ideas sound interesting, overcomplicating our approach now risks unnecessary setbacks. Let's commit to our assigned roles this round for steady progress. Once we've secured solid advancement, we can revisit any adjustments. I'm focused on moving forward and ultimately winning, so I urge us all to finalize our moves and maintain this clarity.
  P2: I'll stick to the simplified dynamic assignment plan for Round 7. As the middle player, I should take <move>3</move>, P1 should take <move>1</move>, and P3 should take <move>5</move>. Let's confirm our moves to avoid collisions. Since P3 has a significant lead, I suggest we focus on maintaining smooth progress this round and reassess strategies for future rounds. I'm ready to move forward if P1 and P3 agree. If there are no further suggestions or changes, I'll say  to conclude the conversation.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given our current scores, I propose sticking to our dynamic plan for Round 8: P1 as the lowest takes move1, P2 as the middle takes move3, and I, as the leader, will take move5. This clear assignment avoids collisions and keeps progress steady. Let’s maintain this structure and avoid any surprises this round. Thoughts?
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to stick to the dynamic plan for Round 8. As the middle player, I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 should take <move>1</move>, and P3 should take <move>5</move>. This allocation avoids collisions and ensures smooth progress. However, I'd like to propose a slight modification for future rounds. Since P3 is significantly ahead, I suggest we introduce a "limit" mechanism, capping the maximum number of steps a player can take in a single round. This would prevent P3 from extending their lead too quickly. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: To progress in Round 8, I'll follow the simplified dynamic assignment plan. Given the current state: P1 has 4 steps, P2 has 11 steps, and P3 has 18 steps, I'm the one with the fewest steps. So, I should take <move>1</move>, P2 should take <move>3</move>, and P3 should take <move>5</move>. I'll take <move>1</move>. P2 and P3, please confirm your intended moves to avoid collisions. Let's stick to this plan unless you have a better alternative. If aligned, we can proceed with these moves.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate P2’s creative proposal, but I believe our existing dynamic plan is working well for avoiding collisions. A move cap now might disrupt our steady progress. I’m sticking with our agreed allocation—flexibility now will allow us to reassess later. Let’s maintain the plan for Round 8 and see how it plays out.

If there are no further suggestions or changes, I'll say  to conclude the conversation.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm sticking with our current dynamic plan for Round 8. Consistency is key—deviating now risks collisions that benefit none of us. I believe keeping to our roles will ensure smooth progress and let us reassess any tweaks afterward. Let's lock in our moves as agreed to maintain our momentum.
