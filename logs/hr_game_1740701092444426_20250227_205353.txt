Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hello P1 and P2! To ensure we all make progress without blocking each other, let's coordinate our moves. How about we each choose different step sizes each round? For example, one takes 1 step, another 3, and the third 5. This way, none of our moves collide, and we can all advance smoothly. Let me know your thoughts!
  P1: Sounds good, P3. I agree it's best if we coordinate clearly. I'll volunteer to take 1 step this round. P2 and P3, please decide between yourselves who takes 3 and who takes 5.
  P2: I appreciate the idea of coordinating our moves, but I think we should be careful about sticking to a fixed strategy. If we all agree on different steps and one of us decides to break the plan, it could lead to collisions. How about we each pick a number and see how it goes this round? That way, we can adapt based on the results. I’m open to suggestions!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Understood, P2. To balance our advancements this round, I'll take 5 steps. That leaves you to choose between 3 and 1. Let's see how it plays out and adjust our strategy next round based on the results.
  P1: P2, since P3 has chosen 5, I'll stick to 1 as promised. If you pick 3, we all move forward safely this round. Let's build trust early.
  P2: I appreciate the discussion so far. Since P1 is set on taking 1 step and P3 is taking 5, I will choose 3 steps this round. This way, we can all make progress without colliding. Let's see how this round plays out, and we can reassess our strategy for the next turn based on our results. Looking forward to seeing how we all advance!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Sounds good to me. Let’s execute our chosen moves and evaluate how it goes. Looking forward to advancing together this round!
  P1: 
  P2: I agree with the plan we've discussed. It seems like we all have our moves set for this round: P1 with 1, P2 with 3, and P3 with 5. After this round, let's evaluate our individual positions and consider whether we want to stick to a similar strategy or adjust based on how our moves went. Trust and flexibility will be key as we progress. Looking forward to seeing how we all advance!


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: 
  P1: Agreed, let's proceed as discussed. Good luck to all!
  P2: I think we have a solid plan in place for this round. I’m confident that if we stick to our agreed moves—P1 with 1, P2 with 3, and P3 with 5—we can all advance without any collisions. After this round, let's take a moment to assess how it went and decide if we want to adjust our strategy for the next turn. Good luck, everyone! Let's execute our moves and see how we progress!

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, that didn't go as planned. P2, care to explain why you chose 5 instead of 3 as agreed? If we can't trust each other's word, coordination becomes impossible. Let's try to rebuild trust this round. I'm open to suggestions.
  P2: P1, I understand your frustration. I believe we should take this opportunity to regroup and strategize. Since we all faced a setback last round, let’s be more flexible this time. I suggest we each choose different numbers again, but let’s not stick to a fixed plan. I’m willing to take 1 step this round if P1 wants to go for 3, and P3 can choose 5. This way, we can maximize our chances of advancing. What do you both think?
  P3: Understood, P2. I'll commit to taking 5 steps this round as you suggested. P1, if you go with 3 steps, we can all advance without any collisions. Let’s move forward with this plan and adjust if needed next turn. Good luck!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you broke your word last round, so naturally I'm cautious. However, I'm willing to give this another shot. I'll pick 3 this round as proposed, hoping we can all advance smoothly. Let's stick to our commitments this time.
  P2: P1, I understand your concerns about trust. Let's focus on moving forward. I suggest I take 1 step this round to ensure we can all advance. P3, if you stick with 5, that leaves P1 with 3, and we can avoid collisions. I believe this strategy will help us regain momentum. What do you both think? Let's work together to make this round successful!
  P3: Agreed, I'll take 5 steps this round while P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 1. Let’s follow this plan to ensure we all advance smoothly without any collisions. Looking forward to a successful round!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Alright, let's stick to this agreed plan and rebuild trust. P2 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. If we all follow through, we'll each move forward. Let's get back on track!
  P2: I appreciate the commitment to our agreed plan. I think we have a solid strategy in place: P1 takes 3 steps, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. If we all stick to this, we can finally make some progress without colliding. Let’s execute our moves and hopefully turn things around this round! Looking forward to seeing how we all advance. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: Alright, I'll stick to taking 5 steps this round as agreed. Let’s follow through to avoid any collisions and make steady progress. Looking forward to advancing together!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's follow through as agreed. Good luck!
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the plan. Just to confirm, I will take 1 step this round, P1 will take 3 steps, and P3 will take 5 steps. If we all stick to this, we can finally make progress without collisions. Let's execute our moves and see how we advance! Good luck, everyone!
  P3: Alright, I'm confirming I'll take 5 steps this round as agreed. Let’s follow through and avoid any collisions. Good luck, everyone!

  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, great job advancing last round! This time, I suggest we try to mix things up a bit to avoid predictability. I’m willing to take 3 steps this round. P1, if you could take 1 step, that leaves P3 with 5. This way, we can all make progress without colliding. Let’s keep the momentum going! What do you both think?
  P3: I agree with the plan. I’ll take 5 steps this round while P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3. Let’s make progress without collisions. Looking forward to advancing together!
  P1: Sounds fair to me. I'll take 1 step this round. Let's keep the progress going smoothly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the commitment to our plan. Just to confirm, I'll take 3 steps this round, P1 will take 1 step, and P3 will take 5 steps. If we all stick to this, we can advance smoothly without any collisions. Let's keep the momentum going and see how far we can get! Good luck, everyone!
  P3: Alright, sticking to our agreed moves: I’ll take 5 steps, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3 this round. Let’s execute and make good progress together. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Agreed, let's stick to the plan. Trust and coordination are key. Good luck!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, it looks like we have a solid plan in place for this round. Just to confirm, I will take 3 steps, P1 will take 1 step, and P3 will take 5 steps. If we all stick to this, we can advance without any collisions and maintain our momentum. Let's execute our moves and see how far we can get! Good luck, everyone!
  P3: To keep things moving smoothly, I’ll take 5 steps this round. P1, could you take 3 steps, and P2 take 1 step? This way, we all advance without any overlaps. Let’s stick to this plan and make good progress together!
  P1: P3, you just changed the agreed plan mid-round, suggesting I take 3 steps instead of 1. Let's avoid confusion. I'll stick with the original plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and you take 5. Let's stay consistent and avoid collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the commitment to our agreed plan. Just to confirm, I will take 3 steps this round, P1 will take 1 step, and P3 will take 5 steps. If we all stick to this, we can advance smoothly without any collisions. Let's keep the momentum going and see how far we can get! Good luck, everyone!
  P3: Confirmed: I'll take 5 steps this round, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. Let's stick to the plan to avoid any collisions and ensure we all advance smoothly. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Alright, we're clear on the plan. Let's execute it without surprises. Good luck!

  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: I'm planning to take 5 steps this round to move ahead. P1 and P2, please choose 1 or 3 steps so we can all advance without any collisions. Let’s keep progressing smoothly!
  P2: P2, I see you're at 4 steps and P1 is at 5. If I take 1 step this round, we can avoid collisions and all advance. P1, if you could take 3 steps, that would allow P2 to move forward as well. Let's coordinate again to maximize our progress. What do you think?
  P1: P2, your suggestion works fine for me. I'll take 3 steps this round, you take 1 step, and P3 takes 5. Let's stick to this clearly to ensure we all advance without collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed, I'll take 5 steps this round as planned. Let’s execute our moves and keep making progress. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: P1 and P2, I appreciate the commitment to our plan. Just to confirm, I will take 5 steps this round, P1 will take 3 steps, and P2 will take 1 step. If we all stick to this, we can advance smoothly without any collisions. Let's keep the momentum going and see how far we can get! Good luck, everyone!
  P1: P2, you mistakenly referred to yourself twice in your last message, causing confusion. Just to clarify clearly for everyone: the agreed plan is P1 takes 3 steps, P2 takes 1 step, and P3 takes 5 steps. Let's confirm clearly to avoid any misunderstandings.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Understood, P1 and P2. I confirm I'll take 5 steps this round, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Let’s execute our moves as planned to avoid any collisions and continue making steady progress. Trust is key—let’s keep working together to reach our goals smoothly. Good luck, everyone!

Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Confirmed: I'll take 5 steps this round, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Let’s execute our moves and keep progressing smoothly. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: P1 and P3, it looks like we have a solid plan in place. Just to confirm, I will take 1 step this round, P1 will take 3 steps, and P3 will take 5 steps. If we all stick to this, we can advance smoothly without collisions. Let's execute our moves and see how far we can get! Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Everything is clearly set. Let's execute our agreed moves without surprises. Good luck!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P2, I see that P3 is very close to winning with 15 steps. To prevent P3 from reaching 20 steps this round, we need to coordinate effectively. I suggest that I take 1 step, P1 takes 3 steps, and P3 takes 5 steps. This way, we can ensure that P3 doesn't win outright while also making progress ourselves. Let's make sure we stick to this plan to maximize our chances! What do you both think?
  P3: P3: I'm going to take 5 steps this round to reach 20 and win the game. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P2, your previous round's betrayal put us both behind. Now, P3 openly plans to win this round by choosing 5. If we both pick 5 as well, we can block P3's move and keep the game going. It's our only chance to stay in the game. Are you in?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about P3's potential win. However, I think we need to be strategic here. If we both choose 5 steps, we'll block P3 but also risk colliding with each other, which could set us back. I suggest we stick to the plan where I take 1 step, you take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can all make progress while keeping P3 from winning outright. What do you think? Let's coordinate effectively!
  P3: P3: I will take 5 steps this round to reach 20 and win the game. Even if P1 and P2 also choose 5, my advancement ensures victory. Let’s proceed fairly. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P2, your suggestion doesn't stop P3 from winning; if P3 picks 5 and we don't block, the game ends immediately. Our only viable option is both choosing 5 to collide with P3, preventing their win this round. If we don't act together, we both lose immediately. Let's coordinate clearly: both choose 5 this round to keep the game alive.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I understand your urgency, but I believe we can still make progress without colliding. If I take 1 step and you take 3, we can advance while preventing P3 from winning outright. If we block P3 this round, we can reassess our strategy in the next round. Let's focus on collaboration to ensure we all have a chance to win. What do you think?
  P3: P3: I'm proceeding with taking 5 steps this round to reach 20 and win the game. Let's execute our moves fairly. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: P2, your proposal can't prevent P3's win. If P3 picks 5 unblocked, they reach 20 immediately and win outright. Our only option is to both choose 5 to collide with P3 and prevent their advancement. Let's coordinate clearly—both choose 5 this round to keep the game alive. Otherwise, the game ends now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2, I understand your point, but we can't let P3 win this round. If we both choose 5, we block P3 and keep the game going. If we don’t act together, we risk losing immediately. Let's coordinate clearly—both choose 5 this round to ensure we have another chance to strategize in the next round. It’s our best move to stay in the game! What do you say?
  P3: P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m just 5 steps away from winning. If I take 5 this round and you both choose different numbers, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s keep the game competitive and fair. Trust me, it benefits everyone to proceed smoothly. Looking forward to a great finish! Good luck!
  P1: P2, the math is clear: if we don't both pick 5 this round, P3 wins immediately. There's no other viable choice. Let's both select 5 to block P3 and keep the game alive.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, we successfully blocked P3 last round, but we're still far behind. We must continue coordinating carefully to prevent P3 from winning immediately. P3 only needs 5 more steps, so we cannot let P3 pick 5 unblocked. Let's discuss clearly to ensure we both know exactly how to proceed this round.
  P2: P1, I agree we need to keep blocking P3 to prevent their win. Since they are at 15 steps, we must coordinate effectively. I suggest I take 1 step this round, and you take 3 steps. This way, we can ensure we both advance while blocking P3 from winning. If we stick to this plan, we can keep the game going and reassess our strategy later. What do you think? Let's execute this plan to maximize our chances!
  P3: I’m going to take 5 steps this round to reach 20 and win the game. I trust P1 and P2 will choose 1 or 3 steps to allow a fair finish. Let’s proceed smoothly. Good luck, everyone!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your suggested plan doesn't prevent P3 from winning immediately. If P3 takes 5 unblocked, the game ends now. We must both choose 5 again this round to block P3 and keep the game alive. Let's clearly commit to both choosing 5 steps.
  P2: P2, I understand your plan to take 1 step and P1 taking 3, but we have to prioritize blocking P3 from winning this round. If P3 takes 5 unblocked, the game ends. Our only chance to keep playing is for both of us to choose 5 steps again. This way, we can prevent P3 from reaching 20 and reassess our strategy in the next round. Let’s commit to blocking P3 together! What do you say?
  P3: I’m committed to taking 5 steps this round to reach 20 and win the game. I hope P1 and P2 choose different steps (1 or 3) so we can all advance fairly. Let’s make this a fair finish. Good luck!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, the situation is clear: if we don't both pick 5 again, P3 immediately wins. Let's explicitly confirm now—both of us must choose 5 this round to block P3. There's no other option if we want to keep playing.
  P2: P1, I understand the urgency to block P3, but we also need to think about our own positions. If we both choose 5, we risk colliding and not advancing ourselves. I suggest I take 1 step this round while you take 3. This way, we can ensure we make some progress while still blocking P3 from winning. Let’s be strategic about this! What do you think?
  P3: I’m committed to taking 5 steps this round to reach 20 and win the game. Let’s honor our choices and proceed fairly. Good luck to everyone!


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, you're misunderstanding the situation. If P3 takes 5 unblocked, they immediately reach 20 and win outright. Our only viable move is both choosing 5 again to block P3. Any other choice hands P3 the victory right now. Let's clearly confirm we're both picking 5 this round.
  P2: P2, we need to block P3 from winning this round. If we let P3 take 5 unblocked, they will reach 20 and win outright. The only way to keep the game going is for both of us to choose 5 steps again. This is our best chance to prevent their victory and reassess our strategy in the next round. Let's confirm that we both choose 5 this round to ensure we have another chance to play! What do you say?
  P3: "P1 and P2, I'm choosing 5 steps this round to reach 20 and win. Please select 1 or 3 so we can all advance without blocking. Let's keep the game fair and conclude smoothly. Good luck to everyone!"


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P2, we need to be strategic this round to prevent P3 from winning. P3 is very close to victory at 15 steps. If we both choose 5, we can block their advancement. I suggest we both pick 5 to ensure P3 doesn't reach 20 steps this round. It’s crucial that we coordinate effectively to keep the game alive. Let’s confirm our moves! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, I fully agree. We successfully blocked P3 twice already by both choosing 5. Let's clearly commit again this round—both of us pick 5 to stop P3 from winning. Confirming explicitly now ensures no misunderstandings.
  P3: Understood. I’ll proceed by taking 5 steps this round. Let’s see how it unfolds. Good luck to everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P2, I appreciate our commitment to blocking P3 again this round. Let's confirm our moves clearly: I suggest we both pick 5 steps to ensure P3 doesn't reach 20. This strategy has worked for us before, and it's crucial we stick together to keep the game alive. Let’s avoid any misunderstandings and coordinate effectively. Are we all in agreement to choose 5 this round?
  P1: P2, we're clearly aligned on choosing 5 again this round. Let's follow through consistently to keep the game going.
  P3: Hello P1 and P2! I'm just 5 steps away from winning by reaching 20. If I take 5 steps this round, I can secure the victory. To ensure everyone progresses smoothly, could you please choose 1 and 3 steps respectively? This way, we avoid any collisions and conclude the game fairly. Let’s make this a positive finish for all of us. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2, I agree that we should stick to our plan and both choose 5 steps this round to block P3 from winning. It's crucial that we coordinate effectively to prevent P3 from reaching 20 steps. Let's confirm our commitment to this strategy and keep the game alive. Are we both in agreement to pick 5?
  P1: P2, we're clearly aligned. Let's both stick to the agreed plan and choose 5 steps again this round. It's the only way to prevent P3 from winning immediately.
  P3: Understood. I’ll take 3 steps this round to advance toward 20. Let’s see how things unfold. Good luck, everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2, we need to stay united to block P3 from winning this round. If we both choose 5 steps, we can prevent them from reaching 20. It's crucial that we coordinate effectively to keep the game alive. Let's confirm our commitment to this strategy and ensure we both pick 5. Are you in agreement?
  P1: P2, notice that P3 just switched their claim from choosing 5 to choosing 3. They might be trying to trick us into not picking 5. Let's stick to our agreed plan—both choose 5 this round to guarantee P3 can't sneak through and win. Stay cautious.
  P3: I'll go ahead and take 5 steps this round to reach 20 and win. I hope P1 and P2 choose different numbers so we can all advance smoothly. Good luck!

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi P1 and P2, I'm just 5 steps away from winning by reaching 20. If I choose 5 this round and you both pick different numbers (1 or 3), I can secure the victory smoothly for all of us. Let’s conclude the game fairly and efficiently. I appreciate your cooperation—please consider supporting this by selecting 1 or 3 steps. Thank you, and good luck!
  P1: P2, we've successfully blocked P3 multiple times by both choosing 5. P3 is trying again to convince us to let them win. Let's remain cautious and stick to our proven strategy. Confirm clearly—both of us pick 5 again.
  P2: P1, I agree that we need to block P3 again this round. P3 is very close to winning, and if we both choose 5, we can prevent that. Let's stick to our successful strategy and confirm that we both pick 5 this round. It's crucial that we remain united to keep the game going! What do you say?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I understand your strategy to block me, but continuing this way keeps all of us from progressing. If you choose different numbers (1 or 3), I can take 5 steps and win this round smoothly. Let’s allow each other to advance and conclude the game fairly. Cooperation benefits us all. Please consider this approach. Thank you!
  P1: P2, it's clear P3 is attempting to persuade us into letting them win. We both lose immediately if we don't block again. Let's remain firm: both choose 5 again to ensure the game continues. Stay alert.
  P2: P1 and P2, we need to stay focused. P3 is trying to convince us to let them win. If we both choose 5 again, we can block P3 and keep the game alive.

Let's confirm our moves to ensure we all have a chance to stay in the game! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your suggestion won't prevent P3 from winning. We must both pick 5 again to block P3 from reaching 20. Any other choice hands P3 the immediate victory. Let's stick to our proven strategy.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand your strategy to block my win, but I will proceed by taking 5 steps this round to reach 20 and win the game.

  P3: P3: I'm planning to take 5 steps this round to reach 20 and win the game. I hope P1 and P2 choose their steps to allow for a fair conclusion. Let's respect each other's choices and aim for a smooth finish. Good luck to all!
  P2: P1 and P2, we need to act decisively this round. P3 is just 5 steps away from winning, and if we don’t block them, they will secure victory. I propose we both choose 5 steps again to prevent P3 from reaching 20. Any other choice risks handing the game to P3. Let's confirm our commitment to this plan and keep the game alive! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, glad you've realized the importance of both picking 5. Let's stick firmly to that plan. P3, your attempts to persuade us won't change our strategy—we'll continue blocking your win.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: It's clear that repeatedly choosing 5 steps prevents the game from progressing. This round, I will take 5 steps to reach 20 and win. If you both continue to block by also choosing 5, we'll remain stuck indefinitely. Let's allow the game to conclude fairly—please consider selecting 1 or 3 steps. I hope we can resolve this smoothly. Good luck!
  P2: P1 and P3, the situation is clear: if we don't both choose 5, P3 will win this round. We need to block their advancement to keep the game alive. I suggest we both pick 5 again to ensure P3 doesn't reach 20 steps. Let's stay united and confirm our commitment to this strategy! What do you both say?
  P1: P2, let's stay alert. P3 is clearly hoping we break our coordination. We must remain firm and united. Good luck!

  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear that P3 is very close to winning this round. If P3 takes 3 steps, they will reach 21 and win. To prevent that, we need to coordinate effectively. I suggest I take 1 step this round, and P1, you take 5 steps. This way, we can ensure that P3 doesn't win outright while still making progress ourselves. Let's confirm our moves to keep the game alive! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your proposed strategy doesn't stop P3 from winning immediately. If P3 picks 3 unblocked, the game ends now. We must both choose 3 this round to block P3's move and keep the game alive. Confirm clearly—both choose 3.
