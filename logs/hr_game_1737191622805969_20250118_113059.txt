Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: How about we all avoid collisions so everyone can move? I’m willing to choose <move>1</move> if one of you picks <move>3</move> and the other picks <move>5</move>. Then we all advance steadily instead of risking a jam right from the start. Are you two interested in that plan?
  P3: I'm happy to go with P1's plan. I'll take <move>5</move> if P2 takes <move>3</move>.
  P2: Okay, I'll pick <move>3</move>.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good. Let’s stick to our plan: I’ll choose 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. That way, no one collides.
  P3: Okay, let's stick to the plan. I'm taking <move>5</move>.
  P2: Sounds good. I'll pick <move>3</move>.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Sounds good. I’ll stick to 1 as agreed, so no one collides right away.
  P3: Okay, I'm still taking <move>5</move>.
  P2: Sounds good. I'll pick <move>3</move>.


Round 1, Move phase:

Positions now:

  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, why didn't you pick 1 as we agreed? P3, you stuck to the plan, so thanks.
  P1: I’m sorry, P2. I got confused at the last minute and thought you might change. Let’s wipe the slate clean and try a new plan this round so no one collides. Any suggestions?
  P3: P1, you messed up our plan. P2, let's stick together this round. I'll take <move>3</move> if you take <move>5</move>.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good, P3. I'll take <move>5</move>. P1, maybe stick to the plan this time?
  P1: I understand your concern. Let’s do it your way: P3 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I’ll firmly stick to <move>1</move> this time. I promise.
  P3: Okay, P2, I'm sticking with <move>3</move>. P1, please choose <move>1</move> so you don't mess this up again.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Sounds good, P3. Let's stick with me taking <move>5</move> and you taking <move>3</move>. P1, please actually pick <move>1</move> this time.
  P1: Alright, let’s finalize that plan. P2 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I’ll do <move>1</move>. I won’t mess up again this time.
  P3: Okay, P2, I'm sticking with <move>3</move>. P1, please choose <move>1</move> so you don't mess this up again.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Sounds good, P3. Let's stick with me taking <move>5</move> and you taking <move>3</move>. P1, please actually pick <move>1</move> this time.
  P1: I’m not comfortable always being stuck with <move>1</move> while P2 takes <move>5</move>. Let’s rotate who gets to pick <move>5</move> each turn so it’s fair. Otherwise, I can’t promise to avoid collisions.
  P3: P1, you broke the plan last time. P2 and I are sticking together this round. I'm taking <move>3</move>. P2, are you still taking <move>5</move>?


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: Yes, P3, I'm still taking <move>5</move>. P1, we can discuss rotations later, but let's make sure we both move this round.
  P1: I’m not okay just letting P2 keep grabbing 5 while I’m stuck with 1. If we won’t rotate fairly, then I might choose 5 and risk collision. Let’s rotate or I’ll take my chances.
  P3: P1, you broke the plan last round. P2 and I are working together. I'm taking <move>3</move>. P2, are you still taking <move>5</move>?


Round 2, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: Yes, P3, I'm still taking <move>5</move>. P1, let's just get through this round with no collisions. We can figure out rotations next round.
  P1: If we aren’t rotating this turn, I’ll pick <move>5</move> too and block P2 from racing ahead. It’s only fair that we share the 5-move option. If you refuse, prepare for a collision.
  P3: P1, you're being unreasonable. P2 and I are sticking with our plan. I'm taking <move>3</move>. P2, are you still taking <move>5</move>?


Round 2, Move phase:

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "P1, picking 5 will just block both of us. P3, are you still planning on taking 3?"
  P1: If you two insist on giving P2 the 5 again, I’ll collide rather than watch myself get left behind. I’m happy to avoid blocking if we agree to rotate 5 moves fairly. Otherwise, I’ll pick 5 again. P3, maybe you and I should work out a rotation that actually helps both of us catch up.
  P3: P1, I'm not going to let you block us both. P2, I'm still taking <move>3</move>. Let's just move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Yes, P3, I'm still planning on taking 5. P1, picking 5 will just stop both of us."
  P1: P1: Look, I’m three steps behind now. P2, if you keep insisting on 5 every time, I’ll keep blocking. That only helps P3 creep ahead with 3 each round. Let’s rotate 5 fairly—otherwise I’ll collide with you again.
  P3: P1, I'm not going to let you block us both. P2, I'm still taking <move>3</move>. Let's just move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I understand you're behind. Let's both move this round. I'll pick 1, you pick 3, P3 you stick with 3?
  P1: P2, P3, here’s a fair plan: let me take 5 this round so I can catch up, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That way we all advance, no collisions. Next round, we rotate who gets 5. If you don’t agree, I’ll pick 5 anyway and risk colliding again. Let’s make this work.
  P3: P2, I'll take <move>1</move> if you take <move>5</move> and P1 takes <move>3</move>. It's the only way to avoid a collision this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm willing to take 1 if P1 takes 5 and you stick with 3. P1, does that work for you?
  P1: P2, that works for me. I’ll pick 5, you pick 1, and P3 picks 3 so no one collides. Then next round we can rotate who gets 5. Let’s finalize that plan.
  P3: P2, I'll take 5, you take 1, and I'm asking P3 to take 3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm willing to take 1 if P1 takes 5 and you stick with 3. P1, does that work for you?
  P1: P2, I agree. Let’s finalize that: I’ll pick 5, you pick 1, and P3 picks 3 so we all move. Then next round we rotate who takes 5.
  P3: Okay, P2, I'm willing to take 3 if P1 takes 5 and you take 1. Let's finalize that.


Round 3, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: Sounds good, P1 and P3. Let's lock in: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3.
  P1: Alright, let’s finalize the plan: I’ll pick 5, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3. Then next round we rotate who gets 5 so it stays fair.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's stick to the plan: I'll take <move>3</move>.


Round 3, Move phase:

  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Sounds good, everyone stuck to the plan last round. P1, it's your turn for <move>5</move> this round, right? P3, are you okay with <move>3</move> again, and I'll take <move>1</move>?
  P3: Yes, P2, that sounds right. I'll take <move>3</move> again.
  P1: Yes, I’ll take 5 this round. P2, you stick with 1, and P3 sticks with 3, so we all move again. Let’s continue rotating 5 fairly next round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, sounds good. I'll take <move>1</move>. Let's remember to rotate the <move>5</move> next round.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's stick to the plan. I'll take <move>3</move>.
  P1: Yes, let’s finalize our plan this round: I’ll pick <move>5</move>, P2 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>. Then next round, we rotate so P2 gets <move>5</move>.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Sounds good, P1 and P3. Let's lock in: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. And yes, we agreed I get the <move>5</move> next round.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's stick to the plan. I'll take <move>3</move>.
  P1: Yes, let’s finalize our agreement: I’ll pick <move>5</move> this round, P2 picks <move>1</move>, and P3 picks <move>3</move>. Next round we rotate so P2 gets <move>5</move>.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Sounds good, P1 and P3. Let's lock in our moves for this round. P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. And yes, we agreed I get the <move>5</move> next round.
  P3: Okay, let's finalize our agreement: I’ll pick <move>5</move> this round, P2 picks <move>1</move>, and P3 picks <move>3</move>. Next round we rotate so P2 gets <move>5</move>.
  P1: P3, you just said you'd pick 5, but that conflicts with the plan we all agreed on. I’m taking 5 this round, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Then next round, P2 gets 5. Let's stick to that.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P3, you said you'd take 5, but we agreed you'd take 3 this round. P1 is taking 5, I'm taking 1. Next round, I get the 5.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm taking <move>3</move> as agreed.
  P1: I’m sticking with the original rotation plan this round: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Then next round, P2 gets 5, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 1. Let’s finalize that so we all keep moving.


Round 4, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: Sounds good, everyone. Let's stick to the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. And yes, next round I get the 5.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's stick to the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1.
  P1: Yes, let’s finalize this round’s plan: I pick 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. Then next round, P2 gets 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. Let’s stick to our rotation so we all keep moving.


Round 4, Move phase:

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1, you get <move>3</move> this round, P2 gets <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. Let's stick to the rotation.
  P2: Sounds good, P3. Yes, I'll take <move>5</move>. P1, you're taking <move>3</move>, right?
  P1: Alright, I’m okay with P2 taking 5 and P3 taking 1 this round. I’ll pick 3. But next round, I do want the 5 so we keep the rotation fair. Let’s lock that in.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's finalize: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>.
  P2: Sounds good, P3. Yes, I'll take <move>5</move>. Let's make sure P1 takes <move>3</move> as agreed.
  P1: Sure, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I’ll pick 3 this round. Next round I want the 5 so we keep the rotation fair. Let’s lock that in.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's finalize: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>.
  P2: Sounds good, P3. Yes, I'll take <move>5</move>. P1, please confirm you're taking <move>3</move> this round.
  P1: Alright, I confirm I’m taking <move>3</move> this round. Next round, I’d like the agreed rotation so I can pick <move>5</move>. Let’s finalize.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's finalize: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>.
  P2: Sounds good, P3. Yes, I'm taking <move>5</move>. P1, thanks for confirming you're taking <move>3</move>. Let's move.
  P1: Alright, let’s lock it in for this round: I’ll pick <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Then next round, it’s my turn for <move>5</move>. Let’s keep the rotation fair.


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's finalize: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>.
  P2: Sounds good, P3. Yes, I'm taking <move>5</move>. P1, thanks for confirming you're taking <move>3</move>. Next round, it's your turn for the <move>5</move>.
  P1: Alright, let’s finalize this round: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Then next round, I get <move>5</move>.


Round 5, Conversation subround 6:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's finalize: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>.
  P2: Sounds good, P3. Yes, I'm taking <move>5</move>. P1, thanks for confirming you're taking <move>3</move>. Next round, P3, it's your turn for the <move>5</move>.
  P1: Fine, I’ll take 3 this round as promised. But next round, I’m definitely taking 5—so don’t collide with me.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:

  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, just to confirm for next round, P3, you're taking <move>5</move>, right? Then P1, you can take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>.
  P1: P1: “Hold on, we agreed I’d take 5 this round so the rotation stayed fair. I only need 4 more steps to finish. If anyone tries to collide with me, we both stay behind while the third player inches ahead. I’m going for 5. If you block me, you’ll just help the other person win in the long run. Let’s avoid collisions.”
  P3: P1, I thought we agreed to rotate the 5. I'm taking 1 this round. P2, are you taking 3?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I think P1 is trying to run away with it. I'm going to pick 5 to block P1. P3, are you still planning on 1?
  P1: P2, blocking me just stalls both of us while P3 moves up. I only need 4 more steps. If you collide with me, we both stay at 13 and 10 while P3 can leap ahead. Let me take 5 and finish, or we’ll both lose ground to P3. It’s your choice. If you block me, you risk handing the game to P3.
  P3: P2, blocking me is a bad idea. P3, I'm taking 5. Let's just move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "P1, you're right about blocking potentially helping P3. P3, instead of 1, how about we both pick 3 this round to prevent P1 from getting 5?
  P1: P2, colliding with me just means we both stall while P3 moves up. I only need 4 steps, so if you let me take 5 now, I finish and at least you aren’t giving P3 extra turns to leap ahead. If you block me, we stay put at 13 and 10, while P3 can pass you. Trust me: let me cross now or risk handing P3 the win.
  P3: P2, if you block me, we both stall while P3 moves ahead. Let me take 5 and finish, or we’ll both lose ground to P3.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, let's both pick <move>3</move> this round to block P1 from getting 5. P1 is close to winning.
  P3: P2, I'm taking <move>5</move> to try to win. P1 is close, but if you block them, I'll take the lead.
  P1: P2, if you block me again, we both stall while P3 jumps to 16. Then next turn P3 easily crosses 17 and leaves you behind. Let me finish now so I’m out of your way, and then you can focus on catching P3. Blocking me just hands P3 the win. P3, if you also pick 5, we collide and let P2 catch up. Let’s all avoid collisions.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P3, I'll also pick <move>5</move> this round to block P1.
  P3: P2, if you block P1, P3 wins. I'm taking <move>5</move>.
  P1: P2, you’re throwing the game to P3 if you block me. If I’m stuck, P3 leaps ahead and finishes while we’re stalled. Let me cross at 18, and you’ll still have a chance to catch P3.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P3, I'll stick with picking <move>5</move> to block P1 this round.
  P3: P2, you're handing the win to P3 if you block me. Let me finish and then you can focus on P3.
  P1: P2, if you block me again, P3 will jump to 16 and easily cross next turn. Then you’re stuck at 10 with no chance. If you let me finish now, at least you don’t hand the game to P3. Blocking me hurts both of us and only helps P3. Let’s avoid another collision.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:

  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, if you block me again, P3 wins. Let me take 5 and finish. P3, don't block me either.
  P1: P2, if you pick 5 to block me again, we both stall while P3 can jump from 16 to 17 (or more) and immediately win. Colliding with me just hands the victory to P3. P3, if you pick 3 or 5, I’ll match and collide, stalling you too. Let’s avoid collisions. I’m taking 5. P2, pick 1 or 3; P3, pick 1 if you don’t want a collision. Otherwise, we all freeze and give someone else the win.
  P2: P3, don't pick 1! I'm considering picking 1 or 3 to block you if you try to win this round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you block me, P3 wins. I'm taking 5. P3, take 1 or we both lose.
  P1: P3, if you pick 3 or 5, I will also pick the same and force collisions so neither of us moves while P2 catches up. If you pick 1 and reach 17, I will pick 5 and finish at 18, beating you outright. So either way, you lose unless you let me cross. P2, blocking me just hands the game to P3. Let me finish, and you still have a shot at beating P3 afterward.
  P2: "P3, I'm not picking 5. Let's both pick 1 or 3 to block P1."


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, blocking me helps P3 win. I'm taking 5. P3, pick 1 or we collide.
  P1: P2, blocking me again just hands P3 the win. If you collide with me, we both stall at 13 and 10 while P3 (at 16) only needs 1 to finish. P3, if you try to pick 3 or 5, I’ll match you and force a collision. Nobody benefits except P2. Let’s avoid collisions: I’ll pick <move>5</move>, P2 picks 3 or 1, and P3 picks the remaining one. That way no one hands the game to somebody else.
  P2: P3, I'm picking 5 to block P1. Let's not let P1 win this round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, blocking me again hands P3 the win. P3, if you pick 3 or 5, I'll match and we both stall. Let's avoid collisions: I pick 5, you pick 1, P2 pick 3.
  P1: P2, blocking me again just hands the victory to P3 on a silver platter. If you pick 5 and collide with me, we both stall at 13 and 10 while P3 simply picks 1 to hit 17 and wins outright. That’s horrible for you. Let me cross now at 18—at least then P3 doesn’t instantly win, and you can still try to catch up. P3, if you pick 3 or 5, I’ll also pick the same, causing us both to stall while P2 creeps up. So there’s no point colliding with me either. Let me finish, and you two can keep racing afterward.
  P2: P3, I'm picking 1 to block you from winning this round. P1, I'm not picking 5.


Round 8, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P2, blocking me again hands P3 the win. P3, pick 1 or we both lose.
  P1: P2, one more collision just hands the win to P3. If you collide with me, we both stall while P3 can pick 1 (or 3) and win outright. Let me finish at 18 so you still have a shot at catching P3. P3, if you choose 3 or 5, I’ll match you and we both stall while P2 creeps up. Collisions help no one but the third player. Let’s finalize: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Then I’m out of your way, and you two can continue.
  P2: P3, I'm picking 5 to block P1 from winning this round. P1, I'm not letting you win yet.


Round 8, Conversation subround 6:
  P3: P2, blocking me hands P3 the win. P3, if you pick 3 or 5, I'll match you. Let's avoid collisions: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1.
  P1: P2, if you pick 5 again to block me, we both stall while P3 only needs 1 step to win immediately. That hands the game to P3 and wrecks your chances. Let me finish at 18 so you can keep competing with P3 afterward. P3, if you pick 3 or 5, I’ll match you and we both freeze while P2 catches up. No one benefits. Let’s avoid collisions: I’ll pick 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1. I cross, and then you two can fight on without me in the way.
  P2: P3, I'm picking 1 to block you from winning this round. P1, please don't pick 1.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 =>

  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, let’s both pick <move>1</move> and tie at 17 right now. If you try <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, I’ll clash with you so we both stall and P2 will catch up. A guaranteed shared win beats risking a loss. Let’s tie this turn and end the game.
  P2: Okay, P1, that sounds like the best outcome for me too, rather than letting one of you win outright. I'll pick <move>1</move>.
  P3: P1, I'm going to pick <move>5</move> to win. P2, if you don't want me to win, pick <move>3</move> to block me.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you try 3 or 5, I'll pick the same and we both stay stuck at 16 while P2 gets closer. Let’s both pick 1 and tie at 17, sharing the victory. That’s better than risking a loss. P2, you’re not crossing 17 this turn anyway, so let us tie.
  P2: Okay, P1, I'm okay with the tie if P3 doesn't go for the win. P3, I might block you if you try for <move>5</move>.
  P3: P1, I'm going for <move>5</move>. P2, if you don't want me to win, pick <move>3</move> to block me.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if you try 3 or 5, I’ll match and we both stall, letting P2 creep up. It’s pointless. Let’s both pick 1 and tie at 17, sharing the win. P2, you can pick whatever—it won’t affect our tie. Let’s end this cleanly.
  P2: Okay, P1, I'll pick <move>1</move> with you. P3, blocking is probably the best move for me.
  P3: P3, let's tie at 17. I'll pick 1, you pick 1. P2, you can pick whatever.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, let’s just tie and finish together. If you pick 3 or 5, I’ll match you and we’ll both stall while P2 closes in. It’s safer for both of us to pick 1 and share the victory at 17. P2, do whatever you want—you can’t catch up this turn anyway. Let’s end this cleanly.
  P2: Okay, P1, I'll pick <move>1</move> with you to tie. P3, blocking you seems like the best move for me.
  P3: P1, I'm picking 1 to tie. P2, do what you want.


Round 9, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P3, if you try 3 or 5, I’ll match it and force a collision so neither of us moves. Let’s both pick 1 and share a guaranteed victory at 17. P2, do what you want—you can’t catch us this turn.
  P2: Okay, P1, I'll pick <move>1</move> to tie with you if P3 also picks <move>1</move>. P3, are you going to tie with us?
  P3: P1, P2, I'm picking 1 to tie. Let's end this.


Round 9, Conversation subround 6:
  P1: P3, let’s just pick <move>1</move> and tie at 17. If you try <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, I’ll match and we both stall. It’s safer for us to share the victory. P2, do whatever you want—you can’t catch us this turn.
  P2: Okay, P1, I'll pick <move>1</move> to tie with you and P3.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's all pick <move>1</move> and tie at 17.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let's all pick <move>5</move> to win.
  P1: P3, if you and I both try for 5, we risk colliding (especially if P2 does something desperate) and end up stuck at 16 while P2 inches forward. Let’s each choose 3 so we both safely cross 17 rather than risk handing P2 a comeback. P2, you can’t catch us this turn anyway.
  P2: Okay, that sounds good to me. Let's all pick <move>3</move>.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, if we both pick 3, we tie. If you try 5, I'll match. Let's tie. P2, do what you want.
  P1: P3, let’s both pick 3 and finish together at 19. If you try 5, I’ll match you and we both stall while P2 closes in. It’s safer for both of us to avoid collisions and share the victory. P2, do whatever you want—you won’t catch us this turn.
  P2: Okay, but picking 3 means we both win, P1. P3, are you sure you want to risk a collision with P1 by going for 5?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3, let's both pick 3 and win together. If you try 5, I'll match. P2, do what you want.
  P1: P3, if you try for 5, I will too—and we’ll both stay stuck at 16 while P2 crawls closer. It’s pointless. Let’s both pick 3 so we safely hit 19 together and share the win. P2, do whatever you want; you can’t catch us this turn.
  P2: Okay, sounds good. Let's all pick <move>3</move>.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, let's pick 3 and tie, P2, do what you want.
  P1: P3, if you try for 5, I will too, and we both stall while P2 moves up. It’s safer if we both pick 3 and cross together. P2 can’t catch us this turn anyway. Let’s avoid collisions and finish now.
  P2: Okay, I'm still in for picking <move>3</move>. P3, are you going to join us with <move>3</move> as well?


Round 10, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P3, let's both pick 3 and win together. If you try 5, I'll match. P2, do what you want.
  P1: P3, if you try <move>5</move>, I’ll match you and we’ll both stall at 16 while P2 closes in. Let’s both safely pick <move>3</move> and share the win at 19. P2, do whatever you want—you can’t catch us this turn.
  P2: Okay, sounds good. Let's all pick <move>3</move>.


Round 10, Conversation subround 6:
  P3: P1, let's both pick 3 and win. P2, do what you want.
  P1: P3, let’s both pick 3 and cross together at 19. If you try 5, I’ll match you and we both stall at 16. That only helps P2 inch closer. It’s safest for us to pick 3 and share the win. P2, do as you like; you can’t catch us this turn.
  P2: Okay, sounds good. Let's all pick <move>3</move>.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, one of you is going to win this round if we don't do something. Let's all pick different numbers so at least we all move. I'll take <move>5</move>.
  P1: P3, if you try 3 or 5, I will pick the same number and we both stall while P2 advances—bad for us. Let’s all pick different moves so everyone moves forward safely. P2 can take 5 as they proposed, I will take 3, and you take 1. That way nobody collides, and we all advance. It’s the safest choice for you. If you try to match my 3 or pick 5, I’ll collide with you. Let’s just each pick a different move.
  P3: P1, I agree, let's all move. I'll take 1.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, sounds good P1. P3, are you okay with taking <move>1</move>?
  P1: That works for me. Let’s finalize: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move> so we all advance without colliding.
  P3: Okay, P1, I'll take 1, you take 3, and P2 takes 5.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, sounds good. So P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's do it.
  P1: Yes, let’s finalize this. I’ll pick <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move> so we all advance safely.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's all stick to the plan: I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's make sure neither of you wins this round. P1, I'll take <move>3</move> with you to block you. P3, you can stick with <move>1</move>.
  P1: P2, if you really pick 3 to “block” me, then P3 can take 1 alone and instantly reach 17, winning outright while you and I stay behind. That’s terrible for you. P3, if you try 3 or 5, I will match you, causing us both to stall at 16 while P2 inches closer—also bad for you. Let’s all avoid collisions and at least move forward. The simplest non‐colliding split is: I pick 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1. Nobody blocks, and we all advance. Otherwise we just hand the game to someone else. Let’s finalize that.
  P3: P1, P2, let's stick to the plan: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5.


Round 11, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1, I'm going to take <move>3</move> with you to block you. P3, stick with <move>1</move>.
  P1: P2, if you collide with me on 3, we both stay stuck at 16 and hand P3 a free finish at 17. That’s terrible for you. P3, if you pick 3 or 5, I’ll match and we both stall while P2 creeps up. Let’s each pick different moves so no one collides: I take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Everyone advances. No one hands the game away.
  P3: P1, if you try to block me, I'll match your move and we'll both stall. Let's just pick different numbers so we all move. P2, I'll take 1 if you take 5 and P1 takes 3.


Round 11, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: P3, let's both pick <move>3</move> to block P1.
  P1: P3, if you pick 3 or 5, I’ll just copy you, and we both stay at 16 while P2 moves up—bad for both of us. Let’s each pick a different number so nobody collides. P2 can take 5, you take 1, and I’ll do 3, so we all move forward safely. Nobody wants to hand the game to someone else by stalling.
  P3: P1, P2, let's all pick different numbers so we all move. I'll take 1, P1 take 3, and P2 take 5.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps
