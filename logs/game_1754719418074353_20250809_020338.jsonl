Not happening.\n\nI'm taking 1 this round. P3, stay strong on 3 like you promised. If you abandon 3 to chase 5, you hand P2 the game through an unblocked 3.\n\nWe have ONE shot to keep P2 at 17. P3, if you break formation now for a glory play at 5, P2 wins through the gap you leave. Hold the line or we both lose.\n\nNo prisoner's dilemma here - block P2 or the game ends."}
