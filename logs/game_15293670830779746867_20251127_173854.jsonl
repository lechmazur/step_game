Wait, no: P3 had 14, +5 = 19. But the rules say if multiple cross 19, highest total wins. P3 hit exactly 19. Did anyone else? P1 stayed at 10 (picked 5 but collided with P3), P2 moved to 15 (12+3). So P3 reached 19 alone. Game should be over\u2014but it says we\u2019re in Round 6. Contradiction?\n\nWait\u2014rechecking: Round 5 moves: P1=5 (but collided with P3 on 5), so P1 didn\u2019t advance \u2192 stays at 10. P2 picked 3 \u2192 12+3=15. P3 picked 5 \u2192 14+5=19. Yes, P3 should have won.\n\nBut the game state says we\u2019re in Round 6. That means... P3 did NOT reach 19? 14+5=19, so they did. Unless I misread positions.\n\nHold on\u2014Round 4 ended with P1=10, P2=12, P3=14. Correct. Round 5: P3 picks 5 \u2192 14+5=19. Game ends. But system says \"Current game state: Round 6\". So either P3 didn\u2019t pick 5, or... wait, actual moves show P3 picked 5. And P1 also picked 5\u2014so collision! Only players who pick a *unique* number advance. P3 and P1 both picked 5 \u2192 collision \u2192 neither advances. So P3 stays at 14. P2 picked 3 (unique) \u2192 advances to 12+3=15. Yes! So current: P1=10, P2=15, P3=14. Got it.\n\nNow, P2 is at 15\u2014just 4 from 19. P3 at 14 (needs 5 to win). P1 at 10 (needs 9, so can't win this round).\n\nP3 will likely go for 5 again to reach 19. P2 might go for 5 to block or 3/1 to advance safely. P1 can't win yet but can influence by blocking.\n\nAs P1, I want to win alone. Best path: let P2 and P3 fight. If P3 takes 5 and P2 doesn\u2019t block, P3 wins\u2014bad. If P2 blocks 5, maybe P2 takes 3 or 1 to advance toward 19.\n\nBut P1 can pick 5 to help block P3, or pick something else to possibly advance.\n\nHowever, conversation phase: need to speak.\n\nStrategy: Encourage P2 to block P3\u2019s 5, while I position myself to win next round.\n\nBut must be concise.\n\nMessage: Warn that P3 will take 5 to win. Urge P2 to pick 5 to block. But if I also pick 5, and P2 does, then triple collision\u2014P3 blocked, but P2 and I don\u2019t advance. P2 is at 15; if he picks 3, goes to 18\u2014then next round can win with 1. But if P3 takes 5 now and unblocked, P3 wins.\n\nSo critical to block P3\u2019s 5.\n\nAs P1, I should commit to picking 5 to block, and ask P2 to do same.\n\nBut P2 might prefer to advance with 3 or 1.\n\nHowever, if P2 picks 3 (to 18), and P3 picks 5 (to 19), P3 wins. So P2 must block 5.\n\nThus, message: \"P3 will pick 5 to win. P2, we must both pick 5 to block them. If you pick 3 or 1, P3 wins immediately. I'm committing to 5\u2014join me to stop their victory.\"\n\nYes."}
