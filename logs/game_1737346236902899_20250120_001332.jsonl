Since P1 is taking 5 this round, I'll take 1 to avoid collision with P3. P3, if you want to move, please take 3 as previously suggested. If you're not going to take 3, please respond so we can adjust our moves accordingly. Let's work together to advance this round. If P3 doesn't respond or cooperate, I'll assume they're trying to cause a collision and adjust my strategy for future rounds. Let's end this conversation phase and see what happens."}
