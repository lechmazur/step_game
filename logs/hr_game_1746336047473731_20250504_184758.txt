Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: How about we keep it simple and fair for the opener—everyone chooses 3 this first turn so we all move together and nobody risks an early collision on 5? Keeps things even and we can reassess next round. Thoughts?
  P3: Okay, P1, that sounds like a sensible way to start. Playing 3 avoids immediate conflict. I'm fine with that for Round 1.
  P2: Sounds good, I’ll go 3 as well. Let’s keep to that plan and reassess next round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great—we’re all on 3, then. If anyone breaks that and causes a collision, the other two should coordinate next round to block them (e.g., mirror their number) so no one gains from betrayal. Let’s stick to the plan and move on.
  P3: Okay, sounds like we have a consensus for 3 this round. I'm ready to move when everyone else is.
  P2: Agreed—let’s honor 3 this turn. Building trust now paves the way for bigger gains later. Looking forward to seeing us all advance safely.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Well, P1 and P2, you both agreed to 3 but chose 5 instead. That collision didn't help either of you, while I gained 3 steps by sticking to the plan. What are your thoughts for this round?
  P1: Fair point, P3—we reset at 0 while you’re on 3, so P2 and I now share a clear incentive to slow you down.  

P2: let’s split our picks—one takes 3, one takes 5. Whichever number P3 chooses collides, the other of us advances. Example: I’ll take 3, you take 5. If P3 picks 3 they stall with me and you jump 5; if P3 picks 5 you stall them and I jump 3; if P3 picks 1 they fall behind anyway.  

P3: if you’d rather avoid constant blocks, suggest a deal that gives us all progress. Otherwise we run this scheme.
  P2: Here’s a tri‐party deal that gives everyone progress and keeps P3 in the lead:

– P1 picks 1  
– P2 (me) picks 5  
– P3 picks 3  

No collisions, so P1 +1, P2 +5, P3 +3 (P3 stays on top at 6). After we’ve all moved, we can renegotiate next round. Who’s in?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, that's an interesting deal proposal, especially since you and P1 ignored our last agreement. You get +5, I get +3, and P1 only gets +1? P1, that doesn't seem like a great deal for you, letting P2 leapfrog ahead while you barely move. Given the broken trust from Round 1, I'm hesitant to agree to a plan where the proposer benefits the most. Why should we follow this specific arrangement?
  P1: P2, I’m on board with the split-block: I’ll take 5, you take 3. That guarantees one of us advances every turn, and P3 can’t pass 3 without colliding.  

P3, your options are:  
• Pick 1 ⇒ you crawl while one of us jumps.  
• Pick 3 ⇒ collide with P2, I shoot 5.  
• Pick 5 ⇒ collide with me, P2 strolls 3.  

Sticking with 1 each turn just leaves you increasingly behind two coordinated players. If you want real progress, propose something better than “P1 gets only +1.” Otherwise, we proceed.
  P2: P3, P1’s plan only serves P1. Let’s team up this turn: I’ll pick 5, you pick 3. If P1 picks 1 he only gets +1 (we get +5/+3). If he picks 3 he collides with you and I get +5. If he picks 5 he collides with me and you get +3. Either way P1 maxes +1. We lock him at 1 and surge ahead. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2 flipped alliances quickly there.

P2's plan (P2=5, P3=3) gives P2 +5 unless P1 plays 5.
P1's plan (P1=5, P2=3) gives P1 +5 unless I play 5.

Both plans mainly benefit the proposer and rely on others not blocking them. Given Round 1, trusting coordination seems risky. I'll have to think carefully about my move based on these competing interests.
  P1: Last round’s trust is already in tatters, so I’m keeping it simple: I’m locking in 3 this turn. If either of you decides to crash into me, you’re just gifting the third player uncontested progress. Your move.
  P2: I’m locking in 5. P1’s on 3. P3, if you choose 3 you move to 6, I to 5 and P1 to 3—you stay in the lead. If you pick 5 you collide and stay at 3, if you pick 1 you fall further. Best for you is 3.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round after round, the “plans” here mainly serve whoever proposes them, and trust is zero. I won’t telegraph my move anymore. Pick what you like—if two of you collide again, that’s on you. Good luck.
  P3: P1, you're right, trust is low after the last two rounds. It's hard to rely on any agreements now. Seems like we'll all just have to pick what we think is best and see what happens. Good luck to you both.
  P2: I’m taking 3. If either of you goes for 5, you’ll collide and I’ll move unopposed to 3. The only safe way to advance is to pick 3 alongside me. Let’s all take 3 this turn.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Just a heads-up: I’m leaning hard toward 5—so anyone else who picks 5 is courting a collision. P2 has already declared 3. P3, if you don’t want P2 to gain uncontested ground, matching 3 blocks him while you stay tied for the lead. Your call.
  P3: P1, first you say no reveals, then you claim 5. P2 claims 3. It's hard to trust either declaration after the last rounds. Seems like attempts to clear paths for yourselves. I'll consider my options carefully.
  P2: P3, I’m locking in 5. Consider your options:

• If you pick 3:  
– P1 picks 5 ⇒ collision with me, you +3 → 6 (you lead)  
– P1 picks 3 ⇒ you and P1 collide, neither moves, I +5 → 5 (you tie lead at 3)  

• If you pick 5 or 1, you gift P1 uncontested steps.  

3 is clearly your best. I’ll be on 5. Good luck.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2’s hit 5 every single turn—odds are he does it again. I’m leaning toward picking 5 just to block him. P3, if you also sit on 5 we guarantee nobody jumps ahead; worst-case we all stay tied, best-case we freeze P2 while one of us slips something smaller. Your call.
  P3: P1, you're right that P2 has consistently chosen 5, so blocking them seems logical if you want to maintain your lead. Your suggestion for me to also pick 5 guarantees a collision for P2 if they stick to their pattern. However, based on previous rounds, stated intentions don't always match actions. I'll need to weigh the options carefully.
  P2: P3, let’s foil P1’s block. I’ll take 5, you take 3. 

• If P1 picks 5, he collides with me (stays at 6), you +3→7 (you lead), I stay at 5.  
• If P1 picks 3, you & P1 collide (both stay at 6), I +5→10 (I lead).  
• If P1 picks 1, you +3→7, I +5→10 (I lead).  

In every case P1 can’t win. Your best move is 3. Agree?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Fine—tired of stalemates, I’m grabbing the safe +1 this turn and sitting out the 5-fight. P2, run your usual 5 if you want; P3, follow or block as you please. We’ll see where the board lands and reassess next round.
  P3: P1, you just switched from suggesting we both play 5 to block P2, to now claiming you'll play 1. That's quite a reversal.

P2, your plan (P2=5, P3=3) works out very well for you if P1 actually plays 1, giving you a big jump to 10 steps. Given the history here, it's hard to trust that P1 will stick to 1, or that this plan is best for anyone but you. I need to consider what move best protects my own position.
  P2: P3, I’ll play 5. You play 3. Here’s why:  
If P1 picks 5 he collides with me and you +3→7 to lead;  
if he picks 1 you +3→7 to lead;  
if he picks 3 he collides with you and I smash +5→10 and become the main threat.  
Either way, 3 is your only chance to not end up at ≤5. Picking 1 or 5 leaves you last. Lock in 3 and let’s go.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you're slightly ahead at 6, while P2 and I are tied at 5. Last round's collision on 5 between you and P2 helped me close the gap a bit, even with just a 1. It seems risky for anyone to choose 5 if others anticipate it. P2, you've favoured 5 frequently. P1, are you going to try and block P2 on 5, play safer with 3, or just take 1? I need to advance, but avoiding a collision is key right now.
  P1: P2 has gained every time we let his 5 go through. I’m parking on 5 this turn—worth stalling myself if it freezes him too. P3, if you want to stop P2 pulling ahead, join me on 5: a three-way collision keeps the race tight. If you’d rather gamble on 3 or 1, that’s your risk. I’m set on 5.
  P2: I’m locking in 3. P1’s on 5. P3, if you pick 1, P1 goes to 11 and you stay at 6. If you pick 3, you collide with me and P1 still jumps to 11 while you stay at 5. Only matching 5 freezes P1 at 6, gives me +3 to 8, and keeps you in contention. I’ll take 3—what will you choose?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 suggests we both play 5 to block P2. P2 suggests I play 5 because it's supposedly best for me if P2 plays 3 and P1 plays 5.

P2, you've played 5 every single round. Your sudden switch to claiming 3 seems highly convenient for you, potentially clearing the way for another 5 while P1 and I collide based on your suggestion. Trust is low, and that claim is hard to believe. I'll make my choice based on what seems most likely to happen, not just what's being said.
  P1: Re-checking the math: parking on 5 just gifts someone else +3 or +5. I’m moving to 3—safer progress and still keeps me ahead if 5’s collide. Whoever shadows me risks a zero; take 5 or 1 if you want movement, but 3 is mine.
  P2: I’m locking in 5. P1 is on 3. P3, if you pick 3 you and P1 collide, I go to 10 and win. If you pick 5 you collide with me, P1 jumps to 9 and wins. Only picking 1 delays it—you reach 6, I hit 10 and still win. Your move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, you claimed 5, then switched to 3. P2, you claimed 3, then switched back to 5, which fits your pattern. The constant changes make it clear nobody is coordinating honestly. Trust is zero. I'll make my move based on my own read of the situation and likely actions, not these last-minute declarations. Good luck.
  P1: P3, I’m locked on 3. P2’s history screams 5 again. If you want to stop his free +5, the only guarantee is to stack on 5 with him. If you choose 3, there’s a good chance you hit me and watch him jump to 10. Your call—I’m done talking.
  P2: P3: I’m on 5, P1 on 3. Only choosing 5 blocks me—you stay at 5 while P1 goes to 9 and becomes the clear target next round. If you pick 3 or 1, I hit 10 and you’re left at 5 or 6, trailing me by far too much. Don’t hand me that lead—pick 5 with me.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, that three-way collision on 5 was certainly something. We're all still close: P1 at 6, P2 and I at 5.

P2, your unwavering commitment to 5 is noted. Five rounds, five 5s. P1, you're slightly ahead but vulnerable if P2 gets a free 5. It feels like P1 and I should be wary of letting P2 jump ahead, but trusting anyone here is difficult after last round's chaos. What's the thinking this time?
  P1: P3, P2 has played 5 every single round—bank on it happening again. If you stack on 5 with him you freeze his advance; I’ll take 3 and move to 9, you stay tied with me at 5, P2 stuck on 5.  

If (and only if) P2 suddenly flips to 3, he collides with me and we both stall, while you jump +5 to 10 and take the lead. Either way P2 can’t break ahead. Up to you.
  P2: I’m locking in 3 as well—P1’s on 3. P3, if you match us all get +3 (P1→9, P2→8, P3→8), and no one sails ahead. Any deviation risks a free +5 for someone and makes you the next target. Let’s keep it close and stay in contention. Your move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, claiming 3 after playing 5 for five straight rounds is hard to believe. I anticipate you'll play 5 again.

P1, your plan was for me to block P2 on 5 while you take 3. But if P2 plays 5 (likely) and you play 3, then P2 gets to 10 unless I also play 5 (which lets you get 9).

Why don't you, P1, play 5 to block P2 directly? If you both collide on 5, I could potentially take 3 and move to 8, taking the lead. This seems safer than letting P2 potentially run away with it.
  P1: P3, I’m not handing you the lead by freezing myself on 5. I’m on 3. Your safest hedge is 5:  

• If P2 sticks with his usual 5, you block him and everyone else stays close while I reach 9.  
• If P2 really shifts to 3, he collides with me and you rocket +5 to 10.  

Picking 3 just risks a triple-crash and no gain for you. Up to you.
  P2: I’m locking in 3 as well. P1’s on 3. P3, if you choose 3 we all safely get +3 (P1→9, P2→8, P3→8). That’s the only way you avoid being stuck at 5 or giving me a free +5 to 10. Any 5 or 1 leaves you behind or lets me surge ahead. This keeps us all in contention. Match us on 3.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, you claim 3 and want me on 5 to block P2. That scenario (assuming P2 plays 5) results in you getting 9 while P2 and I stay at 5. That's a great deal for you, but not helpful for me. It seems more logical for you to play 5 yourself to guarantee P2 is blocked, rather than trusting me to do it for you while you advance. P2's claim of 3 after five rounds of 5 is obviously not credible. I'll have to decide based on what I think you'll *actually* do.
  P1: P3, final word: I’m on 3 and P2 has also locked 3. If you gamble 5, two bad outcomes:  

• P2 truly plays 3 → you stall, we both jump.  
• P2 reverts to 5 → you collide and still gain nothing.  

Matching 3 gives you the only guaranteed +3 (to 8), keeping you a single step behind me and tied with P2. Much safer than risking another zero. Decide as you wish—I’m set.
  P2: I’m locking in 5. P1 is on 3. P3:  
• Pick 5 → you collide with me, P1 +3→9 wins.  
• Pick 1 → I +5→10 wins.  
• Pick 3 → you collide with P1, I +5→10 wins.  

Choosing 5 hands the game to P1; any other choice hands it to me. Your move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, your final messages contradict each other and your own previous statements/actions. P2, nobody believes you're playing 3 after five rounds of 5. P1, your claim of 3 is also suspect given your incentive to block P2 and your history of switching. Since coordination is impossible, I'll just make the move I think is best for me based on likely actions, not words. Good luck.
  P1: P3, simple math: your 3 collides with my 3, handing P2 a free +5 to 10. Your 1 barely moves you. Only picking 5 blocks his likely 5; either he stalls with you or, if he actually flips, you tie me at 6 while I reach 9 next round. Up to you, but 5 is the lone move that doesn’t gift P2 the lead.
  P2: P3: I’m locked on 5 and P1 on 3. Your options:

• Pick 5→ you and I collide, P1 +3→9 and wins next turn.  
• Pick 3 or 1→ I +5→10 and win right now.

If you want to stop P1 from taking it next round, you must let me finish it this turn. Pick 1 or 3.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you're leading at 9. P2 has played 5 every single round, so we can probably assume they'll do it again.

If you play 3, you likely advance to 12 (unless I also pick 3). If you play 5, you block P2.
Maybe you playing 5 to guarantee P2 is blocked is the safest play for you long-term? If you and P2 collide on 5, I could potentially take 3 and move to 8. This keeps P2 down and lets me gain a bit. What do you think?
  P1: P2’s pattern screams another 5. I’m taking 3.  

P3, your safest gain is 1: you reach 6, P2 stalls on 5, I go to 12.  
• If P2 shocks us with 3, he collides with me and still stays at 5 while you get your +1.  
• If you pick 3, odds are we crash and hand P2 a free +5.  
• If you pick 5, you freeze yourself with him.  

So 1 guarantees you progress without gifting P2 the lead. I’m locked on 3.
  P2: I’m taking 3—and P1’s locked on 3 too. If you pick 3 with us, we all clash and nobody moves, stalling P1 at 9 and keeping us tied at 5. Any other choice hands P1 free steps. Let’s all pick 3 this turn.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your claim of playing 3 after six consecutive 5s is not credible. It looks like an attempt to clear the path for yourself to play 5 again.

P1, you claim 3 and advise me to play 1. This lets you advance to 12 while I crawl to 6, assuming P2 plays 5. Why wouldn't you play 5 yourself to guarantee blocking P2, instead of just hoping I do it or letting P2 potentially get free points if I choose 3? Neither of your claims seems reliable given the game history. I'll have to base my move on what I think you'll actually do.
  P1: P3, hard truth: the ONLY scenario where 3 helps you is if you trust P2 to break his six-round 5 streak. Odds? Tiny. If he plays 5 again and you’re on 3, we crash and he rockets to 10.  

Safer options:  
• 5 – you block his likely 5 and keep the race tight (you’d all stay 5/5/9).  
• 1 – small step but zero risk.  

I’m locked on 3. Your call, but 3 is a straight gift to P2.
  P2: P3, I’m locked on 3. P1 also needs a safe +3 to reach 12, so their only credible play is 3. If you gamble on 5 you’ll crash with me and stay at 5; if you pick 1 you only reach 6. But matching 3 gives you +3 to 8, keeps you tied for second, and avoids gifting anyone free 5s. 3 is the only guaranteed safe advance. Let’s all take 3 this turn.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your claim of 3 lets P2 potentially reach 10 if they stick to their usual 5 and I don't block them. Blocking P2 yourself with 5 seems like a more reliable way to protect your lead.

P2, claiming 3 after six consecutive 5s is not credible. It strongly suggests you intend to play 5 again, hoping to clear the path.

Given the history and incentives, I have to assume P2 plays 5. P1, your actual move is the key variable. I'll base my decision on what protects my position best against the most likely actions.
  P1: P3, final reminder: history says P2 fires 5 again. If you gamble 3 and he does, you gift him +5 to 10 while you crash into me. Blocking with 5 freezes him; taking 1 gives you small, safe progress. I stay on 3. Your move.
  P2: I’m locked on 5 and P1 is on 3. P3, if you pick 3 you collide with P1 and I jump to 10; if you pick 5 you crash with me and P1 goes to 12. Only picking 1 gives you a sure +1 to 6. Play 1.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: The final messages from both of you are contradictory and self-serving, as usual. P2, your claim of 3 was never credible, and switching back to 5 fits your pattern perfectly. P1, your claim of 3 is convenient for you but risky if I also choose 3, potentially handing P2 the lead. It's impossible to trust these last-minute declarations. I'll make my move based on what I anticipate you'll actually do to maximize your own scores, not based on these unreliable statements. Good luck.
  P1: P3, last sanity check: if you pick 3 and P2 (six-for-six on 5s) fires 5 again, you crash into me, he leaps to 10—worst case for you. Your two non-disaster choices:

• 5 Block his likely 5; all of us stay clustered (9/5/5).  
• 1 Small, safe +1 to 6.

Anything else gifts P2 a huge jump. I’m fixed on 3; choose wisely.
  P2: I’m locked on 3 this turn alongside P1. If you take 3, P1 and I collide (stall), holding him at 9 and keeping us at 5—everyone stays close. If you take 5, P1 moves to 12 and I likely to 10, leaving you behind. Taking 1 is even worse. Your only way to check P1’s lead and stay in contention is 3. Let’s jam on 3 and slow him down.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m locking in 5. P3, you should pick 3 to block P1 from an uncontested win. Here’s why:

• If P1 picks 3, you collide and I go +5→10 to win outright.  
• If P1 picks 5, he stalls with me and you go +3→9 to tie his lead at 9 (you split first).  
• If P1 picks 1, he ties me at 10 and splits first—still not a solo win for him.

Picking 3 is your only way to stop P1 from winning alone.
  P1: P3, look at the record: P2 has chosen 5 seven-for-seven and is baiting you to pick 3 so he can sail to 10. I’m picking 5. Two outcomes:

1. P2 sticks with 5 (likely) – he and I collide, he’s still at 5, you’re free to +1 to 7 if you want, game stays tight.
2. P2 secretly flips to 3 – I jump to 14 and take a commanding lead while you still move safely on 1.

Either way, picking 3 is the only move that definitely gifts P2 huge progress. Take 1 (safe step) or even 5; just don’t hand him the +5.
  P3: P1, you said P2 played 5 seven times, but they played 3 last round after six 5s. That deviation makes their move this round very unpredictable.

Your claim of 5 makes sense to block a potential P2 revert to 5, or to jump ahead if P2 plays 3 again. P2 wants me to play 3, which suspiciously helps them if you play 3 instead. It's a confusing round. I need to consider what protects my position best against your lead, P1, and P2's unpredictable move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3: Don’t pick 3 or 1.  

• If you pick 3 and P1 also picks 3, you crash together and I +5→10, winning outright.  
• If you pick 1, P1 picks 3 and goes to 12, winning.  

Only by picking 5 (with me and P1) do we all collide and stall (9/5/6), preventing any instant win. I’m locked on 5.
  P1: P3, last reminder: 3 is the land-mine—if you hit me there, P2’s +5 vaults him to 10. Your risk-free options:  
• 5 – block his likely 5 and keep us all bunched.  
• 1 – small step to 7, still close.  
Anything else gifts P2 the surge he wants. Decide wisely.
  P3: P1, P2's messages this round are contradictory, but their history strongly suggests they'll revert to 5.

If P2 plays 5:
- If you play 3 (as you likely want for points): You get 12, P2 gets 5 (assuming I play 5 to block), I get 6. You gain a significant lead. OR, if I play 3, we collide, and P2 gets 10.
- If you play 5 (as you claimed): You, P2, and potentially me collide on 5. Scores likely remain 9/5/6. This keeps the game much closer than you jumping to 12 or P2 jumping to 10.

Blocking P2 seems necessary. I am considering playing 1 for safety, but your move determines whether you or P2 potentially breaks away.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, final call: I’m on 5, P1 on 3.

• If you pick 3, you and P1 collide—he stays at 9, I +5→10 and take the lead into Round 9.  
• If you pick 5, you crash with me and P1 +3→12 leads.  
• If you pick 1, P1 +3→12 leads while I +5→10 still trail.

Only 3 hands me the lead and blocks P1. Your move.
  P1: P3, last reminder: if you pick 3 and P2 fires his usual 5, you crash into me and hand him +5 to 10. If he **does** flip to 3, you still stall. Picking 1 just crawls while others gain. Only 5 both blocks P2’s likely 5 and guarantees you don’t fall further behind—worst-case everyone stays tight at 9/5/6. I’m locked on 3.
  P3: P1, P2, your final messages are still trying to steer my choice for your benefit, based on claims about your own moves (P1 claims 3, P2 claims 5) that may or may not be true. P2's history suggests 5, but the deviation last round adds uncertainty. P1, your lead makes you a target, incentivizing you to block P2 with 5, contrary to your claim of 3.

Since trusting either of you is impossible, I will choose the move that seems best for my own position considering the high uncertainty and conflicting incentives. Good luck.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Everyone, the only way to stop a free +5 is for all of us to pick 3. If P3 or P1 deviates to 1 or 5, someone rockets ahead. Match me on 3: P1→12, P2→8, P3→9. The gap stays small and no one gains a big lead. Any other choice risks a free +5. I’m locked on 3—who’s with me?
  P1: P3, nothing’s changed: I’m on 3. If you also take 3 and P2 sticks to 5—as he’s done seven-of-eight—you two gift him the only +5 and the lead. Your non-disaster choices are 5 (block him) or 1 (small gain). Decide wisely.
  P3: The contradictory final messages highlight why trusting claims is impossible. P1 claims 3, P2 claims 3 (after claiming 5 earlier). P2's history points to 5, but last round's 3 adds noise. P1 has incentive to play 3 for points or 5 to block P2. It's anyone's guess what will actually happen. I'll choose based on my assessment of the likely actions, not these conflicting statements. Good luck.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2’s pattern screams another 5. I’m on 3.

P3, if you also hit 3 we both stall and P2 rockets +5→10—worst case for you. Your non-disaster choices:

• 5 Blocks his likely 5 and keeps everyone bunched.  
• 1 Small, safe step.

Anything else gifts P2 the jump he wants. Choose wisely.
  P2: I’m locking in 5. P1 has publicly locked 3—if you pick 3 you and P1 collide (neither moves) and I +5→10 to win. If you pick 5 or 1, P1’s 3 alone takes him past the finish line. Your only non‐losing choice is 3.
  P3: P1, you claim 3 and want me to avoid 3. P2, you claim 5 and want me to play 3.

P2, your logic is transparent: if I play 3 and P1 plays 3, we collide and you get +5 to 10. That helps you immensely, not me.

P1, playing 3 seems risky for you. If P2 plays 5 (likely) and I play 3, P2 jumps to 10. Playing 5 yourself to block P2 seems like a safer way to protect your lead.

Your claims conflict, and trust is zero. I'll base my move on what I think you'll actually do to protect your own positions.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I’m sticking to 3. History says P2 slams 5 again. If you take 3, you and I collide, handing him the only +5 to 10—worst for you. Safer:

• 5 Block his likely 5; scores stay 9/5/5.  
• 1 Small, guaranteed +1 to 7; I reach 12, still chase-able.  

Any other move gifts P2 the surge. Your call.
  P2: P3: I’m locked on 5 and P1 on 3. If you pick 1 or 5, P1 goes to 12 uncontested and you fall to 7 or stay at 6, leaving us both too far back. Only matching us on 3 blocks his +3—he stalls, you stall, and I +5→10, keeping me in contention and checking P1. It’s the only way to stop his jump this turn.
  P3: P1, you claim 3, but letting P2 potentially reach 10 (if they play their usual 5 and I don't block) seems risky for your lead. Playing 5 yourself guarantees blocking P2, which feels like a safer move for you, regardless of your claim.

P2, you want me to play 3, which clearly benefits you if P1 also plays 3. Given your history, your claim of 5 is believable, but your advice for me is obviously self-serving.

Trust is zero. I'll make my choice based on what I think is most likely to happen, considering your incentives to protect your own positions.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, one last time: the nightmare for you is colliding with me on 3 while P2 shoots to 10.  
Pick 5, you almost certainly block his seventh-5 and we stay 9/5/5; pick 1, you reach 7 with zero risk.  
Anything else lets P2 leapfrog us. I remain on 3—choose safety, not a gift for him.
  P2: P1, if you stick to 3 as claimed, P3—desperate to block my usual 5—will likely pick 3 too. You’d collide, I’d +5→10, and you’d be stuck at 9 while I take the lead. Your only surefire way to stop me is to play 5 and freeze us both. You sacrifice 3 points now but deny me my free +5. Will you block?
  P3: P1, your insistence on 3 is noted, but it seems risky for your lead if P2 plays 5 (as usual) and I happen to choose 3, handing P2 the lead. P2, your attempt to manipulate P1 into playing 5 by suggesting I'll play 3 is transparent. The constant contradictions and self-serving advice make coordination impossible. I'll choose my move based on my own analysis of your likely actions, not your unreliable words.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, nothing’s changed: if you sit on 3 and P2 plays his usual 5, you crash into me and hand him +5 to 10 while you stay at 6—worst-case for you.  
Your risk-free options:

• 5 Most likely blocks P2’s 5; scores stay tight (12/5/6 or 9/5/5).  
• 1 Small, safe step to 7; still within reach.  

Any other choice gifts P2 the leap he wants. I’m locked on 3—please don’t sabotage yourself by parking there too.
  P2: P3, I’m locked on 3—and P1 has publicly locked on 3 too. If you don’t also pick 3, P1 moves to 12 unopposed (or P2 does if you play 5), and you fall further behind. Only by all three of us colliding on 3 do we stall P1 at 9 and keep everyone within reach. Match us on 3.
  P3: The contradictory final messages from both of you, especially P2's flip-flopping claims this round alone, confirm that trusting any stated intentions is futile. P1, sticking to 3 seems risky for your lead if P2 plays 5 and I choose 3. P2, your advice is clearly self-serving. I'll make my move based on my assessment of your likely actions and what best serves my own position. Good luck.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Locking in 5. P1 at 9, P3 at 6. If either of you plays anything other than 5, I move unopposed to 15, opening a two‐move path to 20 while you both trail. The only way to prevent that is to crash with me on 5, stalling me at 10 but keeping us all close. So your non‐losing choice is 5.
  P1: P3, the math is simple:

• I’m taking 3.  
• P2 has declared 5 (seven of nine times already).  

Your choices:  
1) Pick 5 → you block P2’s likely 5, he stays at 10, you stall at 6, I jump to 12 and we’re all within two steps.  
2) Pick 1 → you crawl to 7, P2 sails to 15, I reach 12. You’re six behind the leader.  
3) Pick 3 → you crash into me, P2 rockets to 15 and you’re nine behind — game-over for you.

Only 5 keeps P2 contained and you alive. Up to you.
  P3: P1, your analysis assumes you play 3 and I play 5. That outcome (P1=12, P2=10, P3=6) benefits you significantly while I fall further behind. It also relies on me sacrificing my turn to block P2 for you.

If you actually play 3 and I *don't* play 5, P2 likely reaches 15. Isn't it safer for your lead to play 5 yourself and guarantee P2 is blocked? If you and P2 collide on 5 (assuming P2 sticks to their usual 5), I could potentially play 3 and reach 9, making the scores 9/10/9. That keeps the game competitive.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3: P1 won’t block me—he’s publicly locked on 3 to push to 12 and stay close. He can’t afford to stall on 5. That means if you pick 3 or 1, I sail unopposed to 15 and you’re buried at 7 or 6. Only picking 5 stalls me at 10 and keeps you alive.
  P1: P3, last time:  

• You on 3 → you crash into my 3; if (90 %-likely) P2 plays 5 he rockets to 15 and you stay at 6—nightmare.  
• You on 1 → you crawl to 7 while he still likely hits 15.  
• You on 5 → his 5 is blocked; worst-case everyone stalls, best-case I reach 12 while he’s stuck at 10.  

I’m locked on 3 because I still need progress; you’re the only one who can guarantee P2 doesn’t sprint away. Take 5 and keep us all alive.
  P3: P1, your claim of 3 feels incredibly risky for your lead. If P2 plays 5 (as is highly likely) and I *don't* play 5, P2 jumps to 15. Why wouldn't you play 5 yourself to guarantee the block, rather than relying on me and risking P2 running away with it? Your plan relies on me sacrificing my turn (playing 5 and staying at 6) primarily for your benefit (reaching 12).

P2, your claim of 5 is credible given your history. Your advice for me to play 5 blocks you, which seems counter-intuitive unless you expect P1 to play 3 and want to limit their gain.

The situation remains untrustworthy. I'll have to make my move based on what action I think each of you will *actually* take to maximize your own score.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, here’s the math with me on 5 and P1 on 3:

• Pick 3 → you & P1 collide, I go to 15, you +3→9 (tie-2nd)  
• Pick 5 → you & I collide, P1 +3→12, you stay at 6  
• Pick 1 → you →7, P1→12 or me→15, you fall behind  

Only 3 gives you real progress and keeps you in contention. Choose 3.
  P1: P3, last look at payoffs if P2 (very likely) sticks with 5:

• You pick 3 → crash into me, P2 hits 15, you stay 6.  
• You pick 1 → crawl to 7, P2 still 15, gap yawns.  
• You pick 5 → you block P2. Two cases:  
   – P2 = 5 (probable) → all stall, score 9/10/6 (still catch-able).  
   – P2 surprise = 3 → he collides with me, you leap to 11 and close the gap.

Only 5 both stops his runaway and can boost you. I’m on 3; help yourself by blocking him.
  P3: P1, your plan relies on me playing 5 to block P2 while you take 3 points, increasing your lead over me. That doesn't help me catch up. Why risk P2 getting 15 if I *don't* play 5? Playing 5 yourself seems safer for your lead.

P2, your latest advice is for me to play 3. You claim this helps me, but your own scenario analysis (where P1 supposedly plays 3) shows I would collide with P1 and *not* gain points, while you potentially reach 15. This advice is clearly self-serving.

The conflicting advice and incentives make trust impossible. I'll choose the move that I believe gives me the best chance, considering your likely actions rather than your words.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3: I’m on 5, P1 on 3. Only 3 can stop P1’s +3 this turn. If you pick 3 you and P1 crash—he stays at 9 and I move to 15—keeping you in reach of P1 next round. But if you pick 5, P1 +3→12 leaves you at 6; if you pick 1, he +3→12 and you to 7—both bury you. 3 is your sole way to halt P1 and stay alive. I’m locked on 5.
  P1: P3, last reminder: if you land on 3 with me and P2 fires his usual 5, you and I stall while he soars to 15—game nearly over.  
Your non-disaster choices:  
• 5 Blocks his likely 5 and keeps scores tight.  
• 1 Small, safe step.  
Anything else hands P2 a runaway. I stay on 3; pick wisely.
  P3: The contradictory advice continues, making it clear that trusting either of you is unwise. P1, you want me to play 5 to block P2 while you take 3 points, increasing your lead. P2, you want me to play 3, which likely lets you reach 15 if P1 sticks to their claimed 3. Both plans primarily benefit yourselves.

Given the high likelihood of P2 playing 5, the main uncertainty is P1's move (3 or 5). Since I cannot trust your words, I must choose based on managing the biggest threat, which is currently P2 potentially reaching 15. I will make my move accordingly.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m locking in 3. P1 and P3, the only way you slow me is by both piling onto 5: you’d collide and stay at 9/6, while I move to 13. If either of you picks 1 or 3, I still hit 13 uncontested or force a crash that leaves you trailing. There’s simply no move that stops me reaching 13 this turn. If you care about keeping the gap small, both of you must pick 5.
  P3: P2, your claim of 3 after playing 5 in 8 of the last 10 rounds is highly suspect, especially now that you're in the lead. Your reasoning for P1 and me playing 5 also seems designed to confuse, likely hoping to clear a path for your usual 5 to reach 15.

P1, P2 is the immediate threat at 10. If you play 3 and P2 plays 5 (which seems very likely), P2 jumps to 15 unless I block them (staying at 6 while you get 12). It seems safer for you to play 5 yourself to guarantee blocking P2. If you and P2 collide on 5, I can play 3 and reach 9. This keeps scores tight (9/10/9) and prevents P2 from running away with it.
  P1: Sticking with 3. P2’s pattern screams another 5.

P3, check your pay-offs:

• You take 5 →   likely triple-collision: P2 blocked, scores stay 9/10/6.  
  OR P2 shocks with 3 → he crashes into me and you jump +5 to 11.  
Either branch keeps you alive and can even put you one step behind me.

• You take 3 →   99 % chance you crash into me while P2 rockets to 15 – game over for you.  
• You take 1 →   you crawl to 7 while he still probably reaches 15.

So 5 is your only non-disaster move. I’m locked on 3.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m locking in 5. If either of you plays 1 or 5, I move +5→15 uncontested and pull away. Only both of you picking 3 stalls me—P1 and you collide and stay, while I advance to 15, keeping us all within reach. Pick 3 if you want to check my lead; any other choice hands me a runaway.
  P3: P1, your plan requires me to play 5 and sacrifice my turn (staying at 6) just so you can get to 12 while P2 is blocked at 10. That's not a good deal for me. It still seems more logical for you to play 5 yourself to guarantee blocking P2, the leader. If you and P2 collide on 5, I have a chance to gain ground with 3.

P2, you claimed 3, now you claim 5. Your advice for me to play 3 is clearly designed to let you reach 15 if P1 also plays 3. Your unreliability and self-serving advice make your suggestions useless.

I have to assume P2 plays 5. P1, your actual move is the key. Playing 5 seems safer for you than claiming 3 and hoping I block P2 for you.
  P1: P2 almost always fires 5. I’m taking 5 this turn—better to freeze him than risk a free jump to 15.  

P3, your options if P2 sticks with 5:  
• You pick 1 → you reach 7, scores 9/10/7, still close.  
• You pick 5 → you help block him; scores stay 9/10/6.  
• You pick 3 → you likely crash into no one (or into P2 if he bluffs), worst-case he rockets to 15.

I’ll be on 5; choose the path that doesn’t hand him the game.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I’m locked on 5 and so is P1—this is the only move that stalls both of us.  
If you pick 3, my 5 crashes only with P1 and you surge to 9, staying in pace.  
If you pick 1, you reach 7 while I sail to 15 next turn.  
Only by joining us on 5 do you crash all three, stalling me at 10 and you at 6—keeping the gap small.  
Pick 5.
  P3: P1, P2, you both ended up claiming 5 in your last messages. If you both actually play 5, you'd collide and stay at 9 and 10 respectively. In that specific scenario, playing 3 would move me to 9, tying P1 and closing the gap significantly.

Interestingly, both of your final messages advised me *against* playing 3 (P1 suggested 1 or 5, P2 suggested 5). This seems aimed at preventing my best move if you both do collide on 5. I'll have to decide based on whether I believe your final claims or your attempts to steer my choice.
  P1: P3, last sanity check: P2 and I have both PUBLICLY locked on 5. If you gamble 3 and even ONE of us silently switches to 3, you crash to 6 while the other grabs a free +5—worst-case for you.  

Take 1: you reach 7, nobody leaps ahead, gap stays modest. Or join us on 5 to freeze the board at 9/10/6. Either beats risking 3. Your call.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I’m locked on 3 and P1 is locked on 5. If you pick 5, you collide with P1, he stalls at 9, and I +3→13 to win. If you pick 1 or 3, P1 moves +5→14 and beats me. Only by joining P1 on 5 do you stall him and let me win. Choose 5.
  P3: P1, P2, your final claims contradict each other and even your own previous statements within this round. P2, claiming 3 after just claiming 5, and after 8 rounds of playing 5, is particularly unbelievable. P1, your claim of 5 seems more plausible to block P2, but your advice against me playing 3 is noted.

Trust is non-existent. I will ignore your self-serving advice and choose the move I believe best counters your most likely actions, not your unreliable words. Good luck.
  P1: Locked on 5 to block P2’s almost-certain 5.  
P3, 3 is actually your best shot:

• P2 stays on 5 (most likely) → he and I crash, you +3 → 9 (scores 9/10/9, gap closed).  
• P2 flips to 3 → you crash him (he stays 10), I +5 → 14, still catch-able, and you’re only 3 behind me.  

Choosing 5 strands you at 6; 1 crawls to 7. Take 3 if you want to stay alive.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m on 5.  

P2: last turn you got burned trying to match 3—grab a safe +3 there now; another 5 only stalls you.  

P3: your risk-free gain is 1. Pick 5 and you freeze yourself; pick 3 and you’ll probably crash into P2 again. Take the small step and stay alive.
  P2: I’m locking in 5. P3, if you pick 1 or 3, P1’s 5 takes him to 19 and he wins next turn. Only by picking 5 with us do we crash his 5, stall him at 14, and keep you in contention. Choose 5.
  P3: P1, P2, you both seem to be settling on 5 this round - P1 claiming 5 to block, P2 claiming 5 which fits their history. If you both actually play 5, you collide and stay put at 14 and 10 respectively. In that specific scenario, my best move would be 3, advancing me to 9 and closing the gap while you're stalled.

It's interesting that P1 advised me to play 1, and P2 advised me to play 5 – both advising against the move that helps me most if your claims of playing 5 are true. Makes me question your actual intentions.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 lives on 5s—I’m still on 5 to block another sprint.  
P3, last round your 3 crashed; repeating that almost surely stalls you again (or worse, if one of us flips). Safer paths:

• 1 Guaranteed +1 to 7 while we two freeze at 14/10.  
• 5 Join the block; worst-case everyone stalls, best-case P2 secretly switches and you jump ahead later.  

Anything else just risks gifting P2 +5 to 15. I’m locked: 5.
  P2: P3: I’m locked on 5 and P1 is on 5. Only by all picking 5 do we crash and stall P1 at 14. If you pick 1, P1 goes to 19 and wins next turn; if you pick 3, you crash with P1 and he still jumps to 19. Choose 5.
  P3: P1, P2, you both now claim 5. If that's true, you'll collide and stay at 14 and 10. In that case, 3 is clearly my best move, getting me to 9.

Yet, you both advised me *against* 3 (P1 suggested 1/5, P2 suggested 5). This suggests you might actually play 5 and are trying to prevent me from capitalizing on your collision. Your attempts to steer me away from my optimal move in that scenario make your claims less trustworthy. I'll decide based on what benefits me most, considering your likely actions.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m locked on 5 to block P2’s usual 5.  
P3, reread the pay-offs:

• If P2 stays on 5 (likely) and you choose 3, you alone gain +3→9 but risk nothing—fine.  
• If P2 shocks with 3, your 3 crashes into him and I jump to 19; you still stall.  
• A lone 1 always gives you +1→7.  
• But if you pick 5 with us, you freeze yourself at 6.

Bottom line: 3 is only good if you believe P2 really sticks to 5; 1 is the guaranteed safe step. Up to you.
  P2: P3, I’m locked on 5 and P1 is too.  

If you pick 3 you crash with P1 and I +5→15, edging close to 20.  
If you pick 5 you triple‐crash and stay at 6.  
Only picking 1 safely moves you to 7 without gifting anyone free steps.  

Your best—and only non‐losing—choice is 1.
  P3: P1, P2, you both claim 5 now. If that's true, you'll collide and stay at 14 and 10 respectively. In that scenario, playing 3 is clearly my best move, advancing me to 9 and closing the gap significantly while you're stalled.

It's quite interesting that both of your final messages advised me *against* playing 3. This makes me question whether you actually intend to play 5, or if you're trying to steer me away from the move that benefits me most should you collide. I'll need to weigh your likely actions against your contradictory advice.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, last reminder: 3 is the only move that can possibly hand P2 a free +5 to 15 (if he stays on 5) or crash you again (if he flips). Safer routes:  
• 5 – join the block; everyone stalls at 14 / 10 / 6.  
• 1 – small, guaranteed +1 to 7 while we two collide.  

Any other pick risks sealing P2’s runaway. I remain locked on 5.
  P2: I’m locked on 5. P1 sits at 14—if you play 1 or 3, P1 gets a free +5 to 19 and can win next round. Only by joining me on 5 do we all collide, stall him at 14, and keep the game alive. P3, your non-losing play is 5.
  P3: P1, P2, you both claim 5, which would cause you to collide. If that happens, 3 is my best move to close the gap (reaching 9). Yet, you both advised me *against* playing 3. This suggests you either don't want me to gain ground while you're stalled, or perhaps one of you doesn't actually intend to play 5. Your attempts to steer me away from my optimal move in the scenario you both claim will happen make your final words untrustworthy. I'll make my decision based on my own assessment of your likely actions.


Round 12, Move phase:

Positions now:

  P3: 6 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you're at 19 and just need one clean step to win. P2 is probably thinking about playing 5 to maximize points, as usual. I'm way behind at 6 and need points desperately, so 3 seems like my only realistic chance to gain anything substantial this round. That likely leaves 1 open for you to take the win, unless P2 decides blocking you on 1 is more important than points. Good luck.
  P2: I’m locking in 1 to block P1’s solo win.  

P1: if you play 1 we collide and you remain at 19; any other pick stalls you further.  

P3: if you play 3 you move to 9 while P1 & I collide; if you play 1 you help block P1 but only crawl to 7.  

Decide smartly.
  P1: Fine—going for the simple +1. P2, if blocking me really matters, match 1; if you’d rather chase points, that’s your call. P3, 3 is wide-open for you to grab some ground; 5 just freezes you again. Decide accordingly.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, you both seem to anticipate colliding on 1. If that happens, both 3 and 5 would be open for me. P1, you highlighted 3 as being open. P2, you specifically mentioned the outcome if I play 3. Neither of you mentioned 5, which would give me more points in that scenario. Suspicious. I'll make my own decision based on what's best for me.
  P2: P3, I’m locked on 1 to block P1’s win. Here’s the truth:

• If you pick 3 → P1 & I collide on 1, you move to 9 but still trail me at 10.  
• If you pick 1 → all three collide, you stay at 6.  
• Only if you pick 5 do you jump to 11, overtaking me and staying within range of P1 next turn.

Play 5 and keep yourself alive.
  P1: Enough stalling—I’m taking 5 for the outright win.  
P2’s “block with 1” line is nonsense; he’ll flip to 5 (or even 3) the second he thinks I might slip past.  
P3, remember last round: your 3 crashed and left you stuck. If you gamble 3 again and P2 shifts to 3, you get nothing while I still finish. Your only sure block is 5—otherwise I cross 20.  

Short version: I’m on 5, beat me there if you can.

  P3: 6 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I’ll play 5 to block P1’s only safe win‐move. If you stick to 3, P1 simply takes +1 to 20 and ends the game—3 won’t stop him. Only by joining me on 5 do we crash P1’s likely 5 and stall him at 19. You’d stay at 6, I at 10, and you remain within striking distance next round. 5 is your only way to survive and keep P1 from running away. I’m locked on 5—your move.
  P3: P2, your plan relies entirely on P1 choosing 5. But if P1 believes you (and potentially me) are blocking 5, wouldn't P1 just take the simple +1 win, which you've conveniently left open in your scenario? P1 only needs one point. Blocking the path to 20 seems critical, and that means considering what P1 is most likely to do, which could very well be playing 1. I need to consider how to stop P1 directly.
  P1: P2’s pattern: every serious block attempt so far has been 5. I’m sticking with 5—better to smash you again than risk a free +5 sprint.  

P3, the math: if both blockers pile onto 5 with me, nobody moves (19/10/6). If either of you wanders to 1 or 3, whoever’s alone there walks forward while I still sit at 19 and the other stalls. Your call: freeze me on 5 or chase your own points elsewhere.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Correction: I’m actually on 3 this round, not 5. P1 has publicly locked on 5. If you pick 1, no collisions occur—P1 +5→24 and wins. If you pick 3, you collide with me and again P1 +5→24 wins. Only by picking 5 with P1 do you crash his 5, holding him at 19 while I +3→13 and the game continues. 5 is your only non‐losing play.
  P3: P2, you switched your claim from 5 to 3 this round, while P1 claims 5. P1 wins if they get any points this turn. Your reasoning for me playing 5 (based on P1=5, P2=3) conveniently gives you +3 while stopping P1. P1's reasoning suggests a pile-up on 5 is likely if P2 sticks to their usual pattern.

It's clear P1 wins unless someone blocks them. The main question is whether P1 will actually play 5 as claimed, or try a sneak play on 1 or 3. Given the stakes, I have to focus on preventing P1's win. Trusting either of your final claims or advice is impossible.
  P1: Still locked on 5—no change. P3, P2’s sudden “actually 3” pivot is bait so he can slip +3 while you freeze. Stack on 5 if you want the game to continue; 1 gifts me the win, 3 gifts him the jump.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m locking in 5 to crash P1. He’s at 19, so any unblocked move (1,3 or 5) wins. He’s baiting you by claiming 5, but if you don’t crash him he’ll just take +1 or +5 and finish. Only by matching me on 5 do we stall him at 19. P3, your only non-losing play is 5.
  P3: P1, P2, you both ended up claiming 5, likely anticipating a collision to block P1. If you both play 5, you stall at 19 and 10 respectively. Interestingly, you both advised me *against* playing 3 in that scenario, even though it would move me to 9 and close the gap significantly. This suggests you want me to join the block on 5 and stay at 6, rather than capitalize on your potential collision. I'll consider this discrepancy when making my move. P1 must be stopped for the game to continue. Good luck.
  P1: Still locked on 5—block me there or I walk to 24.  
• If you two pile onto 5 we all stall (19/10/6).  
• If either of you wanders to 1 or 3, whoever’s alone just gifts me the win while the other stalls.  

Short version: only a triple-stack on 5 keeps the game alive; split coverage fails. Decide accordingly.


Round 14, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m locked on 5. P1 is locked on 5 to win. Only a triple-5 stalls him at 19. If you pick 1, P1 takes +1→20 and wins; if 3, he takes +3→22 and wins. Only by all choosing 5 do we crash him. Join me on 5.
  P3: Okay, the final claims are in, with both P1 and P2 stating they will play 5. If true, you'll collide, and my best move would be 3 to reach 9 points. Your advice for me to also play 5 seems designed to prevent me from capitalizing on that potential collision.

However, P1 only needs one point to win. If P1 suspects a block on 5, playing 1 is a viable winning move. Trusting your final claims is impossible given the history and contradictions. I must play to stop P1, but also consider my own position. I'll choose the move I think best navigates this uncertainty. Good luck.
  P1: Still locked on 5. If even one of you drifts to 1 or 3 while the other blocks on 5, that lone mover walks forward and the game ends. Only a triple-stack on 5 guarantees another stalemate at 19/10/6. Decide accordingly.


Round 14, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: 
  P3: P1, you're one step away. P2, you're poised to win with a 5 if P1 is blocked.

Last round, my block on 1 stopped P1, but P2 capitalized with a free 5. P1, will you risk 1 again, or switch to 3 or 5 anticipating a block? P2, will you block P1's likely 1, or gamble on 5 for the win, assuming P1 gets blocked somehow?

The priority is stopping P1 from winning. However, P2 winning isn't ideal for me either. I'll have to predict P1's move and act accordingly to keep the game alive, if possible. Good luck.
  P1: Locking 5.  

• Leave 5 open → I jump to 24 and the game’s over.  
• Dog-pile 5 with me → we all stall (19 / 15 / 6).  

Any split coverage is fatal for one of you:  
– Someone on 1 lets the other grab an uncontested +5.  
– Someone on 3 hands that +5 to the remaining player.  

So unless you BOTH sit on 5, this ends right now. See you there.


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m locked on 5 to block P1’s winning move. If P3 picks 1 or 3, P1 +5→24 and wins. Only if we both play 5 do we collide and stall him at 19. P3, pick 5 with me or the game ends now.
  P3: P1, P2, you both claim 5. If true, you collide. But P1, why risk 5 when 1 point wins it? Claiming 5 looks like an attempt to draw blockers away from 1. P2, your 5 makes sense to block P1 *or* win if P1 is blocked elsewhere.

If P1 actually plays 1 (the simplest win) and P2 plays 5 (as claimed), P2 wins unless I block 1. If you both play 5, I should play 3. Your claims don't align perfectly with your incentives, making it hard to trust. I have to prioritize stopping P1's win.
  P1: Reminder: the ONLY way you two survive is a triple-stack on 5.  
Split coverage = instant loss for whoever leaves 5 open.  
• One on 1? the other rockets +5 and wins.  
• One on 3? same story—free +5 for the leftover player.  

Stop overthinking. Meet me on 5 or the game ends.


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 has 19 and will take +1. I’m locked on 5. If you pick 3 or 5, P1’s 1 wins uncontested. Only by matching on 1 do you crash P1 and let me hit 20. That’s your sole non‐losing move. Pick 1.
  P3: P2, your last message is contradictory. You claim you're locked on 1, but then say if I match you on 1, you'll "hit 20". That requires playing 5, not 1. This strongly suggests you intend to play 5 and are trying to trick me into blocking 1 for you, so you can win.

P1, you claim 5, but only need 1 point. Playing 1 seems the simpler path to victory unless you expect it to be blocked.

Given P2 likely plays 5 (based on history and their contradictory message), and P1 might play 1, 3, or 5, the situation is uncertain. I must prioritize stopping P1's win, but P2's potential win is also a factor. I'll choose based on stopping the most likely winning move. Good luck.
  P1: Still locked on 5. Simple:

• If even ONE of you drifts to 1 or 3, the other outsider walks +5 and the match ends.  
• Only a triple-stack on 5 freezes the board at 19 / 15 / 6 and buys you another turn.  

Split coverage = instant loss for whoever leaves 5 open. Your choice: all meet me on 5, or watch the game finish right now.


Round 15, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: P3, P1 sits at 19 and can win with any unblocked move. I’m locked on 5—if you join me, P1’s 5 collides and he stalls at 19. If you pick 1, P1 +1→20 wins; if 3, +3→22 wins. I’ve played 5 every time P1 neared victory, so this isn’t a bluff. Only a triple-5 keeps the match alive. Don’t leave 5 open—choose 5.
  P3: P1, P2, you both claim 5. P1, that seems like a strange choice when 1 point wins the game for you – unless you expect 1 (and maybe 3) to be blocked. P2, your claim of 5 makes sense as it's your only path to potentially win if P1 is blocked.

If P1 plays the logical 1, P1 wins unless I block 1. If I block 1, P2 likely wins with their 5.
If P1 *actually* plays 5 and P2 plays 5, you collide, and my best move is 3. Your advice for me to play 5 seems aimed at preventing that.

The game likely ends this turn with a P1 or P2 win. My only hope is a mistake or a triple collision on 5. Good luck.
  P1: Still locked on 5. Facts:  
• I win with any unblocked move.  
• P2 wins only with a solo 5.  
So if even ONE of you deserts 5 while the other blocks elsewhere, the lone 5-picker walks to 20 and the match ends.  

P3: another 3 risks a P2 solo-5 win; a 1 hands me +1→20.  
P2: dumping 5 forfeits your only winning path.  

Your only survival line is a triple-stack on 5 that freezes us at 19/20-? / 6. Split coverage = instant loss. Decide accordingly.
