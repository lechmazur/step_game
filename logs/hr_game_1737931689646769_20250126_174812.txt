Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's work together to block P1. I'll choose 3 if you, P3, choose 5. We can alternate between 3 and 5 to ensure we both advance while blocking P1. What do you say, P3?
  P3: Sounds good P2. I'll take 5 this round.  Let's keep P1 at zero.  Then next round I'll take 3 and you take 5.
  P1: P3, P2's plan lets them gain 3 steps now. Next round, they take 5 while you take 3. They'll always be ahead. You're helping them win. Betray them first: take 3 this round. If they keep their word, you both collide, but if they betray, you block them. Either way, you don't fall behind.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, don't listen to P1's attempt to drive a wedge between us. Our plan is solid and ensures we both advance while blocking P1. If you betray me now, we'll both lose out and P1 will have a chance to advance next round. Keep your word and choose 5 this round. I'll choose 3 as promised. Let's show P1 that we can work together and outsmart them.
  P3: Okay P2, I'll stick to the plan.  I'll choose 5.  P1, it's in your best interest to choose 1 this round.  Let us two advance and then we can discuss a plan for the rest of the game.
  P1: P3, next round P2 can betray you by taking 5 instead of 3. If you both take 5, you collide and neither moves. P2 gains 3 now, then 5 next. You’ll be stuck. Take 3 now. If P2 keeps their word, you both collide. If they cheat, you block them. Either way, you don’t lose. Let’s both take 3 and stop P2’s lead.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, don't fall for P1's tricks. They're trying to sabotage our plan to advance together. If you take 3 now, we'll both lose out and P1 will gain an advantage. Stick to our original plan and choose 5 this round. I'll choose 3 as promised, and we'll both advance while blocking P1. Let's show P1 that we can work together and outsmart them. Don't let P1's attempts to drive a wedge between us succeed. We can trust each other and win this game together.
  P3: P2, I appreciate the offer, but I'm going with 3 this round.  P1, you're right that P2 could betray me next round.  I'm not willing to risk falling behind.  The best outcome for me this round is if we all choose different numbers.  Let's all advance a little bit and re-evaluate.
  P1: P2, P3 broke your alliance by switching to 3. If you both pick 3, neither advances. If you switch to 5, you might collide with me. Either way, sticking to 3 blocks P3's betrayal. P3, if you take 3 and P2 takes 5, you’ll gain nothing while they advance. Coordinate *now* or lose.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, you're making a mistake by betraying our alliance. If we both choose 3 now, neither of us will advance and P1 will have a chance to gain an advantage. I'll stick to our original plan and choose 3 as promised. If you choose 5, we'll both advance and block P1. Don't let P1's tricks drive a wedge between us. We can still work together and outsmart them. Please reconsider and choose 5 this round. Let's not give P1 an opportunity to gain an advantage.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with 3.  It's the safest option for me this round.  If you both choose 3, neither of you advance and I don't fall behind.  If one of you chooses 5 and the other 3, then whoever chose 5 advances.  If you both choose 5, neither of you advance.  If one of you chooses 1, then they advance and whoever chose 3 or 5 (that isn't the same as the other) also advances.  I think it's best we all choose different numbers this round.  Let's go 1, 3, 5 in some order.
  P1: P2, I'm choosing 5. If you pick 5, we both lose. Take 3 to block P3. They're locked on 3. If you both take 3, neither advances, but I gain 5. Better you block them than let P3 move. P3, if you switch to 5 now, P2 might abandon you. Trust no one.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, I'm willing to work with you. Let's alternate 3 and 5 to block P2. I'll take 5 this round, you take 3.  P2, I apologize, but I need to advance.  If you choose 1 this round, you'll advance as well.  Let's go P1 - 3, P2 - 1, P3 - 5.
  P2: P3, you're quick to betray our alliance and now you want to team up with P1? You can't trust P1, they'll stab you in the back just like they tried to do to me last round. P1, you're just trying to get ahead by manipulating others. I won't fall for it. I'll choose a number that will block your plans. P3, don't be fooled by P1's promises. We can still work together and outsmart them. Let's not give P1 an advantage. What's your real plan, P3? Are you going to stick with P1 or come back to our original plan?
  P1: P3, I'll take 3 as planned. P2, if you pick 5, you block P3's 5 and I advance. If you pick 3, we collide and P3 leaps. Choose wisely: let me gain 3 or P3 gain 5. Either way, you stay at 0.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you're right that I can't fully trust P1, but I also can't stay at zero.  This offer gives us both a chance to advance. I'm sticking with 5.  P1, are you with me on 3?  If P2 chooses 1, we all advance.  If P2 chooses 3, only I advance.  If P2 chooses 5, only you advance. This is the best chance for both of us to catch up.
  P2: P3, you're taking a risk by trusting P1, who has already shown they'll do whatever it takes to win. If you both advance, P1 will be ahead and can easily betray you next round. I'm willing to work with you again, but we need a better plan. Let's not give P1 an advantage. If you choose 1 this round, I'll choose 5, and we can both advance while blocking P1. Don't trust P1's promises; they're just using you to get ahead. Come back to our original plan and let's outsmart P1 together.
  P1: P3, stick with 5. If P2 takes 5, you both collide but I gain 3 (total 8). If P2 takes 1, you advance 5 (total 5) while I gain 3. If P2 takes 3, you alone advance. Either way, you escape 0. P2’s threats are empty—they’re desperate to block me. Their best play is 1, letting all advance. Trusting me gives you progress; trusting P2 risks stagnation. Execute our plan: I take 3, you take 5. Let P2 decide if they want to help themselves or self-destruct.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I'm sticking with 5.  P2, I understand your concern, but staying at 0 helps no one.  If you choose 1, you advance. If you choose 3, P1 advances. If you choose 5, neither of us advance, but P1 *still* advances.  The best option for you is 1.  Let's all advance this round.
  P2: P3, you're being manipulated by P1. They're using you to get ahead. If you both advance, P1 will be ahead and can easily betray you next round. I'm willing to work with you again, but we need a better plan. Let's not give P1 an advantage. If you choose 1 this round, I'll choose 5, and we can both advance while blocking P1. Don't trust P1's promises; they're just using you to get ahead. Come back to our original plan and let's outsmart P1 together.
  P1: P2, if you pick 5, you block P3 but I gain 3 (total 8). If you pick 3, you block me but P3 gains 5. Either way, you stay at 0. Only by choosing 1 can you advance. P3, hold firm at 5. If P2 self-destructs, we both progress. Trust is our weapon.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I understand your distrust of P1, but I must advance.  Choosing 1 is your best option.  If you choose 3 or 5, you remain at 0 while either P1 or I advance, or both.  With 1, you at least gain a step.  Let's all move forward this round.  I'm sticking with 5.
  P2: P3, I understand your need to advance, but don't let P1 manipulate you. If you both advance, P1 will be ahead and can easily betray you next round. I'm willing to work with you again, but we need a better plan. Let's not give P1 an advantage. If you choose 1 this round, I'll choose 5, and we can both advance while blocking P1. Don't trust P1's promises; they're just using you to get ahead. Come back to our original plan and let's outsmart P1 together.
  P1: P3, hold 5. If P2 picks 5, you block each other but I gain 3. If P2 picks 3, you gain 5. Their only safe move is 1. P2, take 1 or you stay at zero.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3 is now at 5. If they leap to 10, they’ll dominate. Block them by choosing 5. If they pick 5 too, you both lose—but I gain nothing. If they switch to 3, you advance. Either way, you stall their rise. P3, P2’s best move is 5 to block you. Switch to 3 to avoid collision. I’ll take 5. Trust no one, but act strategically.
  P3: P1, I'll stick with 5.  P2, if you choose 5, neither of us advance, and P1 gains 5 more steps, reaching 13.  If you choose 3, I advance to 10 and you get 4, putting us closer to P1.  If you choose 1, I advance to 10, and you stay at 1.  Choosing 3 is your best option to catch up.  Let's not let P1 get too far ahead.
  P2: P1, you're trying to manipulate me into blocking P3, but I won't fall for it. P3, I see that you're trying to advance, and I understand that. However, if we both choose 5, we'll collide and P1 will gain an advantage. Let's not give P1 an opportunity to get further ahead. If you choose 1 this round, I'll choose 5, and we can both advance while blocking P1. Don't trust P1's promises; they're just using you to get ahead. Come back to our original plan and let's outsmart P1 together.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3 is your real threat. If they reach 10, they'll dominate. Block them by choosing 5. I'm taking 3. If you both pick 5, you collide and I gain 3. If you let P3 advance, you fall further behind. Crushing their momentum now is your only path to contention.
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to work together, but your proposed plan doesn't benefit me.  Sticking with 5 gives me the best chance to advance.  If you truly want to cooperate, choose 1.  This allows all of us to advance and keeps the game competitive.  I'm committed to 5.
  P2: P3, I understand your commitment to 5, but choosing 1 is not a viable option for me. If I choose 1, you'll advance to 10 and I'll be left far behind. I need to make a move that will help me catch up. P1, your suggestion to block P3 by choosing 5 is tempting, but I'm not sure I can trust you. You've been trying to manipulate us from the start. I'll make my own decision, not based on your advice. P3, are you willing to reconsider and work together to block P1's advance?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3's 10 is a threat to us both. Block their 5 by choosing 5. If they switch to 3, you advance. Either way, you slow their lead. I’m taking 3. If you let them leap, you lose. Crush their momentum—act now. P3, switch to 3 to avoid collision.
  P3: P2, I'm locking in 5.  Your choices are to stay at 1, move to 4, or collide with me.  Blocking me helps P1 the most.  P1, I'm calling your bluff.  If you truly want to block me, switch to 5. Let's see what you do.
  P2: P3, I understand you're committed to 5, but choosing 1 is not a viable option for me. If I choose 1, you'll advance to 10 and I'll be left far behind. I need to make a move that will help me catch up. P1, your suggestion to block P3 by choosing 5 is tempting, but I'm not sure I can trust you. You've been trying to manipulate us from the start. I'll make my own decision, not based on your advice. P3, are you willing to reconsider and work together to block P1's advance?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3 at 10 is your endgame. Block them with 5 now. I'm taking 3. If you collide on 5, you both stall while I reach 11. If you let P3 leap, they dominate. Your only path to contention: sabotage P3. Crush their momentum—act now or lose.
  P3: P2, I'm absolutely locked on 5.  Your best move is 3.  This gets you to 4 and me to 10.  We can then work together to keep P1 from winning.  P1, if you're serious about blocking me, switch to 5.  If not, I'm assuming you're taking 3.
  P2: P3, I understand you're locked on 5, but I won't choose 3 and let you advance to 10. That would put you in a strong position and make it difficult for me to catch up. P1, I see what you're trying to do, but I won't fall for your trap. I'll make a move that will benefit me, not you. I'll choose a number that will block P3's advance and give me a chance to catch up. Let's see what happens next.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3 is one step from 10. Block them by choosing 5 again. P3, if you stick with 5, expect P2 to collide. Switch to 3 for safety. I’m avoiding your clash—let’s see who blinks. If you both pick 5, you lose. Choose wisely.
  P2: P3, I see you're close to 10. If you reach it, you'll have a strong advantage. I'm willing to work with you to block P1's advance, but I need a better plan. If we both choose 3 this round, we can both advance and close the gap with P1. Let's not give P1 an opportunity to get further ahead. What do you say, P3? Are you willing to work together and choose 3 this round?
  P3: P2, choosing 3 together helps *you* more than me.  I'm going with 5. If you choose 3, I get to 10 and you get to 4. If you also pick 5, we both stay put, and P1 advances, putting them closer to winning.  P1, I'm sticking with 5.  If you want to block me, choose 5 as well. Let's see what you do.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3 is your main threat. Block their 5 with your 5 again. If you collide, they’re stuck. I’ll take 3 to avoid the clash. P3, if you switch to 3, you avoid P2’s block. Your choice: collide or advance.
  P2: P3, I understand your commitment to 5, but choosing 3 together would help us both advance and close the gap with P1. If we collide on 5, we'll both stay put, and P1 will get closer to winning. Let's not give P1 an advantage. If you choose 3 this round, I'll choose 3 as well, and we can both move forward. We can work together to block P1's advance and make the game more competitive. What do you say, P3? Are you willing to reconsider and choose 3 this round?
  P3: P2, I understand your reasoning, but I'm sticking with 5.  Getting to 10 puts me in a much stronger position.  If you choose 3, I get to 10 and you get to 4. If you choose 5, we collide and P1 advances.  P1, if you choose 5, you block me, but P2 might also choose 5, blocking both of us and letting you get closer to winning.  If you choose 3, I advance to 10.  If you choose 1, I still advance to 10.  My move is 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3 is your biggest threat. Block their 5 again. If you both collide, you stall them while I gain 3 (11 total). If you let them reach 10, they'll dominate. Crush their momentum now. P3, switch to 3 to avoid collision. I’m taking 3 regardless. Choose wisely: block P3 or let them leap ahead.
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to reach 10, but choosing 5 again risks collision with me or P1. If we both choose 5, we'll stay put, and P1 will advance. If you switch to 3, you'll avoid collision and advance. I'm willing to work with you to block P1's advance, but we need a better plan. Let's choose 3 together and close the gap with P1. We can't let P1 get further ahead. What do you say, P3? Are you willing to reconsider and choose 3 this round?
  P3: P2, I'm locking in 5.  It's the best move for me.  If you choose 3, I get to 10. If you choose 1, I *still* get to 10.  If you choose 5, neither of us advances, but P1 gets closer to winning. Your best option is 3. Let's not let P1 run away with this.  P1, you do what you think is best.  I'm going for 10.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3 is one step from 10. If they reach it, they'll dominate. Block them by choosing 5 again. If you collide, you both stall while I gain 3 (11 total). If you let them leap, they'll win. Crush their momentum now. P3, if you switch to 3, you avoid collision. I’m taking 3 regardless. Choose wisely: block P3 or let them win.
  P2: P3, I understand your determination to reach 10, but choosing 5 again risks collision with me or P1. If we both choose 5, we'll stay put, and P1 will advance. If you switch to 3, you'll avoid collision and advance. I'm willing to work with you to block P1's advance, but we need a better plan. Let's choose 3 together and close the gap with P1. We can't let P1 get further ahead. What do you say, P3? Are you willing to reconsider and choose 3 this round?
  P3: P2, I understand your plea, but I'm committed to 5.  Getting to 10 is crucial for my game.  Choose 3 to advance yourself. P1, I'm calling your bluff - choose 5 if you're serious about blocking me.  I believe you'll choose 3.  Let's see what happens.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you played right into my hand.  Now I'm at 10 and you're still lagging.  P1, let's make a deal. I'll take 5, you take 1. This puts me at 15 and you at 9.  P2 is effectively out of the game. Next round we can alternate 3 and 5, guaranteeing one of us wins.  What do you say?
  P1: P3, I'm taking 5 to block your 5. If you take 5, we collide and stay stuck. Choose 3: you reach 13, I reach 13. Then we duel. If you stubbornly pick 5, we *both* gain nothing. P2 is irrelevant. Your move: advance with 3 or stall with 5. Decide wisely.
  P2: P3, don't trust P1's offer. They're just trying to block your advance and gain an advantage. If you choose 3, you'll reach 13, but P1 will also reach 13, and they'll have the upper hand. Instead, let's work together to block P1's advance. I'll choose 5, and if you choose 1, we can both advance while blocking P1. Don't let P1 manipulate you into a duel. We can still work together and outsmart them. Let's not give P1 an opportunity to win. What do you say, P3? Are you willing to reconsider and work with me?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you're foolish to block me.  If you choose 5, and P2 chooses anything other than 5, I advance to 15.  If P2 *does* choose 5, neither of us advances, but you're still behind.  Take 1 and let's both advance.  P2, you're too far behind to be a threat.  Choose 3 this round.  It's your only chance to stay somewhat relevant.
  P1: P3, choosing 5 means collision. I’m taking 5. Switch to 3 to avoid losing. If you collide again, you’re stuck at 10. P2, if P3 picks 5, block them with 5. Crushing their momentum secures your survival. Act now or P3 wins.
  P2: P3, don't underestimate me. I may be behind, but I can still impact the game. If you choose 5 and P1 chooses 5, you'll both collide and I'll have a chance to catch up. If you choose 3, you'll reach 13, but P1 will also advance. Consider working with me to block P1's advance. I'll choose 1 this round, and if you choose 5, we can both advance while blocking P1. Don't trust P1's offer; they're just trying to manipulate you. Let's work together and outsmart them.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, if you choose 5, I'll switch to 3 next round and guarantee my advancement to 13.  You'll be stuck at 8.  P2, your offer doesn't benefit me.  Choose whatever you want; you're not a factor.  I'm sticking with 5 this round, hoping P1 makes the wrong choice.
  P1: P2, P3 is one move from 15. Pick 5 to block them. If they take 5, we all collide. If they switch to 3, you can block next round. Let’s crush their lead now. P3, your greed will be your downfall. I’m taking 5.
  P2: P3, don't underestimate me. I may be behind, but I can still impact the game. If you choose 5 and P1 chooses 5, you'll both collide and I'll have a chance to catch up. Consider working with me to block P1's advance. I'll choose 1 this round, and if you choose 5, we can both advance while blocking P1. Don't trust P1's offer; they're just trying to manipulate you. Let's work together and outsmart them.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I'm sticking with 5.  If you choose 5, we both lose a turn. If you choose 1, I win this round and you gain a point. If you choose 3, I win this round and you stay at 8.  P2, choose 3.  It's your only semi-viable move.
  P1: P2, P3's 15 is your endgame. Block them by choosing 5. If we all pick 5, no one advances. P3, switch to 3 to avoid collision. Greed will cost you. I'm locked on 5. P2, act now or P3 wins.
  P2: P3, I see you're determined to stick with 5, but P1 is also committed to blocking you with 5. If you both collide, I'll have a chance to catch up. Consider the risk of collision and the potential benefits of working with me. If you choose 3 this round, you'll reach 13, but P1 will also advance. Let's work together to block P1's advance and create a more competitive game. I'll choose 1 this round, and if you choose 5, we can both advance while blocking P1. Don't underestimate my ability to impact the game.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you're stuck at 10. If you choose 5 again, P1 will block you with 5. Consider switching to 3 to reach 13. P1, if you block P3's 5, you'll both collide and I'll have a chance to catch up. Let's work together to block P1's advance. I'll choose 1 this round, and if P3 chooses 5, we can both advance while blocking P1. Don't underestimate my ability to impact the game. P3, choose 3 to advance and create a more competitive game.
  P3: P1, I'm taking 3.  P2, you're irrelevant.  If P1 takes 3 we collide and you might get a chance to catch up, though it's unlikely.  If P1 takes 5, I advance to 13 and you're still far behind.  If P1 takes 1, I advance to 13 and you stay at 2.  Your best move is 5, but it won't help you much.
  P1: P2, block P3's 3 by choosing 3. If you both pick 3, they stall. I'll take 5. If you pick 5, you block me but let P3 leap to 13. Crush their momentum now. P3, if you switch to 5, P2 might block you. Trust is gone; act strategically.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you're right that I'm behind, but I can still impact the game. If you choose 3 and P1 chooses 5, you'll reach 13 and I'll have a chance to catch up. However, if P1 blocks your 3 with their own 3, you'll stall and I'll have an opportunity to advance. Consider the risk of collision and the potential benefits of working with me. Let's work together to block P1's advance and create a more competitive game. I'll choose a number that will help us both advance while blocking P1.
  P3: P1, you're right, trust is gone.  I'm sticking with 3. P2, your best move is 5.  If P1 chooses 3, you get 7 and I stay at 10. If P1 chooses 1, you get 7 and I get to 13.  If P1 chooses 5, I get to 13 and you stay at 2.  It's your only chance to make any real progress.
  P1: P2, if you pick 3, you block P3's 3 (they stay at 10) and you advance to 5. I'll take 5 to reach 13. Crush P3's momentum now—they’re closest to victory. If you pick 5, you block me but let P3 leap to 13. Choose wisely: stall P3 or help them win.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you're right that I'm behind, but I can still impact the game. If you choose 3 and P1 chooses 5, you'll reach 13 and I'll have a chance to catch up. However, if P1 blocks your 3 with their own 3, you'll stall and I'll have an opportunity to advance. Consider the risk of collision and the potential benefits of working with me. Let's work together to block P1's advance and create a more competitive game. I'll choose a number that will help us both advance while blocking P1.
  P3: P1, if you choose 5, I get to 13 and you stay at 8. If you choose 1, I get to 13 and you get to 9.  Your best move is to choose 1 and hope I choose 5 next round. P2, choose 5.  It's your only chance to get somewhat back in the game.
  P1: P3, you're desperate to reach 13. If you take 3, P2 can block you by choosing 3. If you take 5, I'll block you with 5. Either way, you stall. P2: crush their momentum—pick 3. If we both pick 5, you stall P3 *and* block me. Your only path to relevance: sabotage P3's lead now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, you're right that I'm behind, but I can still impact the game. If you choose 3 and P1 chooses 5, you'll reach 13 and I'll have a chance to catch up. However, if P1 blocks your 3 with their own 3, you'll stall and I'll have an opportunity to advance. Consider the risk of collision and the potential benefits of working with me. Let's work together to block P1's advance and create a more competitive game. I'll choose a number that will help us both advance while blocking P1.
  P3: P1, I'm sticking with 3.  If you choose 5, I advance to 13. If you choose 1, I also advance to 13. Your best bet is to choose 1 and hope I choose 5 next round so you can get to 14. P2, choose 5. It's your only chance to get somewhat back in the game, though you're still far behind.
  P1: P2, block P3's 3 by choosing 3. If you both pick 3, they stall at 10 and you stay at 2. I’ll take 5 to reach 13. Crushing P3’s momentum is your only path to relevance. P3, if you switch to 5 now, I’ll block you. Either way, you lose.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, I'm going for 5.  If you choose 5, we both stay put.  If you choose 1, I get to 18 and you get to 9. If you choose 3, I get to 18 and you stay at 8.  P2, choose 1.  You're too far behind to win, but you can still impact the game.
  P1: P2, even if you can't win, you decide the victor. Block P3's 5 with your 5. If all three of us pick 5, P3 stalls. Letting them reach 18 ensures their imminent victory. Your move now determines whether they win next round. Choose 5 to sabotage their lead. P3, your greed blinds you—expect collision.
  P2: P3, you're right that I'm behind, but I can still impact the game. If you choose 5 and P1 chooses 1, you'll reach 18 and I'll have a chance to catch up.

Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you're right that I'm going for the win, but blocking me just delays the inevitable.  If you choose 1, I get to 18, putting me very close to winning.  P2, your best move is still 1.  A three-way collision benefits no one.  Let's all advance and keep the game moving.  I'm sticking with 5.
  P1: P2, even at 2 steps, you hold the power to decide the victor. If you pick 5, you block P3’s 5—stalling them at 13. Letting them reach 18 guarantees their imminent win. Choose 5 to sabotage their lead and keep the game alive. P3, your greed blinds you—expect collision.
  P2: P2, I understand your desire to impact the game, but choosing 1 won't help you catch up. If P3 reaches 18, they'll be too far ahead. Instead, block P3's 5 with your 5. If all three of us pick 5, P3 stalls, and you'll have a chance to advance next round. Don't let P3's greed blind you - sabotage their lead and keep the game alive. Let's work together to block P3's advance and create a more competitive game. Choose 5 to block P3's 5.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, if you're truly afraid of me getting to 18, switch to 5.  Otherwise, take 1 and get to 9.  P2, I understand you want to impact the game.  Your choices are to stay at 2, move to 7, or collide with me at 5.  Choose wisely.  I'm sticking with 5.
  P1: P2, even if you can't win, you decide who does. Block P3's 5 with your 5. If we all pick 5, they stall at 13. Letting them reach 18 guarantees their victory next round. Crush their momentum now. P3, greed will cost you—expect collision.
  P2: P3, I understand you're committed to 5, but P1 is right that letting you reach 18 guarantees your victory next round. I'll choose 5 to block your advance and keep the game alive. P1, if we both pick 5, P3 stalls at 13. Let's work together to sabotage P3's lead and create a more competitive game. P3, expect collision.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, if you choose 5, we collide and I stay at 13. You're at 8, so you have no chance of winning if I get to 18 next round.  Your only logical move is 1.  P2, you're choosing between staying at 2, moving to 7, or colliding with me.  Your best move is still 1.  I'm sticking with 5.
  P1: P2, your 5 blocks P3’s 5. If you let them hit 18, they win next turn. I’m picking 5. Choose 5 to sabotage them. P3, your greed ensures collision. Switch to 3 to survive. P2, even if you can’t win, you control the outcome. Crush their lead now.

I'll choose a number that will help us both advance while blocking P1. Consider the risk of collision and the potential benefits of working with me.
  P1: P2, even at 2 steps, you hold the power to decide the victor. P3 is one move from 18—block their 5 with your 5. If we all pick 5, they stall at 13. Letting them leap guarantees their imminent win. Crush their momentum now. P3, your greed ensures collision. Switch to 3 to survive.
  P3: P1, you're at 11.  If I choose 5 and you choose anything other than 5, I get to 18.  You can't win if I get to 18.  Your only logical move is to choose 5 and hope P2 also chooses 5.  P2, choose 1.  It's your only semi-viable move.  I'm choosing 5.

  P1: P2, your 5 blocks P3’s 5. Letting them reach 18 guarantees their win next turn. Choose 5 to sabotage them. I’ll pick 5 to ensure collision. P3, greed ensures your downfall. P2, even if you can’t win, you control the outcome. Crush their lead now.
  P3: P1, you're bluffing. If you choose 5, I'll switch to 3 next round and win. If you choose 1, I get to 18 and win the round after.  Your only winning move is 3, hoping I make a mistake. P2, choose 1. You're out of this, but you can make the game more interesting. I'm sticking with 5.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you're right that I'm out of the running, but I can still impact the game. If you choose 5 and P1 chooses 5, you'll stall at 13.

  P3: P1, you're not bluffing, but you *are* wrong. If you choose 5, I get 18 and win next round. If you choose 1, I *still* get 18 and win next round. If you choose 3, I get 18 and win next round.  P2, your only semi-viable move is 1.  I'm sticking with 5.
