Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all pick different numbers to avoid collisions. I'll take 3 this round. P1 and P3, choose between 1 and 5. If you both pick the same, neither moves. Cooperate now, compete later.
  P1: I'll take 1. P3, take 5 to avoid collision. P2 has 3, so we all move.
  P3: I'll take 5 as suggested by P1. Let's keep this cooperation going and see how far we can all advance without collisions. Looking forward to a competitive game later on!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To maintain fair progress, let's rotate numbers each round. This time, I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 stays with 1. No collisions, everyone advances. We can alternate high steps next rounds. Agreed?
  P1: Let's coordinate: I'll take 5, P2 take 1, P3 take 3. No collisions, everyone moves. Let's accelerate!
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan. Let's keep the momentum going. I'll take 3 as suggested by P2. Looking forward to seeing how this strategy unfolds!
