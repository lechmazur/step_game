Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2! Let's try to avoid colliding on our moves. If we can coordinate a bit, we might all have a better chance to advance without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P1: Hi everyone! I agree coordination is important to avoid collisions. Since this is our first round, maybe we should all choose different numbers to ensure everyone advances? I don't have a strong preference on which number I take, but I'm happy to discuss what might work best for all of us. What are your thoughts on how to allocate the numbers?
  P2: I like the coordination idea, but I worry it might fall apart if someone shifts gears. I’m inclined to take a slightly aggressive approach—maybe a medium-to-high value—to keep pace. What do you both think: should we lock in distinct moves or risk a slight collision for a competitive edge?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your point about taking a competitive edge, but remember, early collisions might slow us all down. How about this: I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move> for this round? This way, we all advance and can reassess our strategies in the next round. Let’s try to avoid stepping on each other’s toes early on. What do you both think?
  P1: I'm okay with P3's suggestion for this round - I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures we all advance without collision. However, to keep things fair, perhaps we should rotate our numbers in future rounds so everyone gets a chance at different values? That way no single player consistently gets the advantage of the larger steps. What do you think?
  P2: I’m comfortable with our agreed assignments for now. However, I’m keeping my options open in case any unexpected changes occur. Early coordination is key, so if everyone sticks to this plan, we all gain. That said, I remain ready to adapt should the situation shift. Let’s see how this round goes and then discuss rotating numbers in future rounds.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, it sounds like we're all on the same page for this round. Let's stick to the plan: I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions. After this round, we can discuss rotating our numbers to keep things fair and balanced. I'm looking forward to seeing how this strategy plays out. Ready to proceed?
  P1: I'm happy with our plan for this round and ready to proceed with taking <move>3</move>. I agree rotating numbers in future rounds would be fair. Let's see how this plays out and adjust our strategy accordingly. I appreciate everyone's cooperation to avoid early collisions.
  P2: I agree, the plan seems solid. I'm on board for 5 this round, but I'll be watching closely and ready to adjust in future rounds if needed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great teamwork last round! We avoided collisions and all advanced. How about we rotate our moves as discussed? I suggest: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move> this time. This keeps things balanced and fair. Thoughts?
  P1: I appreciate the coordination, but I'm concerned about your proposal. If P2 gets 3 steps, they'd be at 8 total while I'd only have 4 steps with 1 move. Since P2 is already leading, maybe they should take <move>1</move> this round? I propose: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This would balance our positions better (8-6-4) and prevent P2 from pulling too far ahead. What do you think?
  P2: I'm weighing fairness with the need to keep our momentum. I appreciate both suggestions, but I’m not eager to hold back my progress if we can all avoid collisions. We might consider a flexible approach—some aggression paired with caution—to maximize advancement without stalling our lead. What do you both think about adjusting moves dynamically rather than strictly rotating?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I see your point about balancing our positions. To keep it fair and dynamic, how about this: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move> this round? This way, P1 can catch up a bit, and P2 maintains a lead without pulling too far ahead. Let's keep the momentum going while avoiding collisions. What do you both think?
  P1: I like P3's latest suggestion. If I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>, we'll end up with a nice balance (8-6-4). This keeps the game competitive while avoiding collisions. P2 maintains a slight lead, I catch up a bit, and P3 makes solid progress. I'm happy with this arrangement for Round 2. Shall we proceed with this plan?
  P2: I'm happy with our discussion so far. But remember, every step is critical here. While I appreciate the balance, I'll remain open to tweaking my move if I see a chance to tip the scales in my favor. Let's all keep a close eye on our progress and be ready to adjust quickly if needed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems like we're reaching a consensus for this round. P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This keeps things balanced and competitive while avoiding collisions. Let's stick to this plan for Round 2 and see how it plays out. Remember, we can always reassess and adjust our strategies in the next round. Ready to proceed?
  P1: I'm ready to go with our planned moves for this round. I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This gives us a balanced progression (8-6-4) while avoiding collisions. After this round, we should reassess again to keep things fair and competitive.
  P2: I’m good with the plan—I'll commit to <move>1</move> this turn. Let’s stick with our coordination and watch the scores closely. If anything shifts unexpectedly, we'll adjust in the next round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, it looks like we're all set for this round with the agreed moves: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This should keep us balanced and avoid any collisions. Let's proceed with this plan and see how it unfolds. After the round, we can reassess our strategies to ensure fairness and competitiveness. Ready to proceed?
  P1: I think we've thoroughly discussed our plan for this round and everyone is on the same page. Let's proceed with our moves as agreed. Looking forward to seeing how the game progresses!
  P2: I remain committed to our plan and trust our strategy so far. I’ll stick with my move, but I'm closely watching our scores—let's keep communicating and adapt if needed. Good luck this round!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, great job last round! We maintained balance and avoided collisions. For this round, how about we rotate again to keep things fair? I propose: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This keeps P1 in the lead, P2 close behind, and I can catch up a bit. Let’s continue to avoid collisions and reassess after this round. What do you both think?
  P2: I like our coordination, but I’d like to tweak our plan slightly. How about we have P1 take 1 instead, I stick with 5, and P3 take 3? That would bring us to 9 (P1), 11 (me), and 7 (P3) and give me a clear lead. What do you both think?
  P1: Thanks for the suggestions, but I'm concerned with P2's proposal putting them in the lead at 11 steps while I fall behind at 9. Since I'm currently ahead, I propose: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This would put us at 13-9-5, maintaining my lead but giving P2 a solid advancement. Alternatively, if P2 really wants 5 steps, I should get at least 3 to stay competitive at 11-11-5. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand both of your perspectives. To keep it competitive and fair, how about this: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This would result in 11 steps for P1, 11 for P2, and 5 for me, maintaining a balance and keeping us all in the game. Let's avoid collisions and reassess next round. What do you both think?
  P2: I still favor my initial idea: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This plan moves us to 9, 11, and 7, respectively, giving me the edge while keeping things competitive. I know it’s a bit uneven, but it accelerates our progress and sets clear roles. What do you both think?
  P1: I appreciate both proposals, but I believe maintaining the current order is fairest since we've all cooperated so far. My original suggestion (I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>) keeps the same relative positions we've had from the start. 

P2's proposal specifically puts them ahead while pushing me behind, which seems opportunistic after our cooperation. Even P3's suggestion equalizes P2 and me rather than maintaining our established positions.

Let's stick with the pattern we've created through fair play so far.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the concerns about fairness and maintaining balance. How about we consider a slight adjustment to keep things competitive? P1, you take <move>3</move> to stay in the lead, P2 takes <move>5</move> for a boost, and I'll take <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. This way, we reach 11-11-5, keeping everyone in the game without drastic changes. Let's ensure our strategies remain adaptable and fair. Thoughts?
  P2: I appreciate our goal of fairness and steady progress. I prefer we keep our strategy simple to avoid collisions while still advancing competitively. I'm open to small tweaks if needed, but I’d rather not disrupt the balance we've built so far. Let’s focus on a plan that grants each of us steady progress without giving anyone a sudden advantage.
  P1: I notice both proposals would either put P2 ahead or equalize our positions, despite my current lead that came from our fair coordination. I still believe that maintaining relative positions (me-P2-P3) is most consistent with our previous cooperation. My proposal (I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>) preserves this order while letting everyone advance. Let's stick with what we've established through two successful rounds of coordination.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the value in maintaining our established order for fairness. However, I propose a slight variation to keep it competitive: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This results in 11-11-5, maintaining a balance and avoiding collisions. Let's keep our strategies adaptable while ensuring everyone progresses. Thoughts on this approach?
  P2: I support sticking with P1:3, P2:5, and P3:1. That would bring us to 11 for both P1 and me, while P3 reaches 5. It keeps things balanced enough to maintain competitiveness without severe disruption. I'm leaning toward this plan to maximize our progress.
  P1: I've noticed both of you are pushing for a plan that erases my 2-step lead that came from our fair cooperation. I must stick with my position: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This maintains our relative positioning while everyone advances. It's concerning that after two rounds of successful coordination, both proposals specifically aim to diminish my fair lead. Let's honor our established pattern of cooperation.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, last round didn't go as planned due to a collision. To avoid that, let's try a new approach: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This way, we can avoid repeating the collision and ensure everyone advances. Let's keep the momentum going and reassess after this round. What do you both think?
  P1: I see the collision last round was unfortunate. While I appreciate P3's suggestion, it would put P2 in the lead. Since I currently have a slight advantage, I propose: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This allows everyone to advance while maintaining the current positioning. With the game approaching halfway, preserving our relative standings seems fair based on our previous coordination.
  P2: I appreciate both proposals. I’d prefer we avoid collisions while not automatically granting anyone a major jump. While P1’s plan solidly preserves current standings, I’m leaning toward a slightly more flexible move that lets me catch up without overstepping. Perhaps we could consider a compromise that maintains balance yet allows each of us a modest competitive edge? Let me know your thoughts.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's aim to avoid another collision by ensuring distinct moves. I propose: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This keeps us all advancing without disrupting the current standings too much. It’s important we keep the game competitive while allowing everyone to progress. If we agree on this, we can reassess our positions in the next round and adjust strategies as needed. What do you both think?
  P1: I see both proposals, but I need to point out that P3's suggestion would put P2 in the lead at 11 steps while reducing my advantage. I believe maintaining our relative positions from fair coordination is reasonable. My proposal (I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>) allows everyone to advance while preserving current standings. We've cooperated well so far - let's continue with the pattern that's emerged naturally from our fair play.
  P2: To avoid delays and collisions, I propose we settle on a balanced move: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. That would put P1 and me at 11 steps and you at 6, keeping competition steady without any sudden jumps. I remain flexible for slight tweaks if needed, but I believe this preserves our cooperation while progressing safely. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need to avoid collisions and maintain fairness. How about this compromise: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>? This way, P1 maintains the lead, P2 stays competitive, and I catch up slightly. It avoids collisions and keeps us all in the game. Let's ensure everyone advances while keeping it fair. What do you both think?
  P1: I appreciate P3's compromise, but I'm concerned it significantly narrows my lead. I've maintained my position fairly through cooperation. As a counter-compromise, how about: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? This preserves everyone's relative positions while allowing advancement. Since we're approaching the midpoint, maintaining the established order seems most consistent with our previous cooperation.
  P2: I remain firm on our balanced plan: let P1 take 3, I take 5, and P3 take 1. That puts P1 and me tied at 11, keeping us both competitive while letting P3 progress gradually. It avoids collisions and preserves fairness. I’ll stick with 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the importance of maintaining our positions while avoiding collisions. Let's try this: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This keeps P1 in the lead, allows P2 to stay competitive, and gives me a chance to catch up slightly. It avoids collisions and ensures we all advance. Let's see how this round goes and adjust if needed. Thoughts?
  P1: After consideration of all proposals, I'm firm on my position. I've earned my lead through fair coordination, and both counter-proposals specifically erase this advantage. I will take <move>5</move> this round. I propose P2 takes <move>3</move> and P3 takes <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. This maintains the relative positions we've established through our successful coordination so far. I hope we can continue our pattern of cooperation.
  P2: I appreciate the debate. I'm leaning toward a slightly more aggressive approach this round to improve my standing, while still valuing collision avoidance. I’m not locking in my move publicly yet, but I urge everyone to stay flexible and aim for distinct choices so we all progress safely. Let’s keep our options open and adjust if needed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: That triple collision benefits no one. We need to re-establish coordination. Since I'm slightly ahead after our early cooperative rounds, I propose: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This allows everyone to advance while maintaining our relative positions. Let's avoid another wasteful round and return to successful coordination.
  P2: I appreciate your emphasis on coordination, but our scores are shifting. While preserving our relative positions is key, I’m considering a slight tweak to better balance progress and avoid collisions. I’m all for a plan that keeps us safely advancing, and I’m open to any adjustments that protect our leads. Let’s make sure we all choose distinct moves this round so no one’s progress is wasted.
  P3: P1 and P2, the triple collision was unfortunate. Let's ensure distinct moves this round to avoid repeating that. I suggest: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This keeps P1 slightly ahead, helps P2 advance, and lets me catch up a bit. We need to stay competitive while ensuring everyone progresses. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand everyone wants to advance, but our previous coordination established a certain order that I believe we should maintain. The triple collision shows what happens when we can't agree. Let me be clear: I'll take <move>5</move> this round. P2 taking <move>3</move> and P3 taking <move>1</move> allows everyone to progress while respecting our established positions. This preserves the trust we built in our early successful rounds.
  P2: Let's avoid another triple collision. I propose a distinct set: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This would yield scores of 9, 9, and 10, respectively—fair and competitive. I’m open to slight tweaks, but it’s important we all choose different moves this round.
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree that avoiding another collision is crucial. Let's ensure distinct moves this round. I propose: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This keeps P1 slightly ahead, allows P2 to advance, and helps me catch up a bit. It’s important we maintain competitiveness while ensuring everyone progresses. Let's commit to distinct choices to avoid wasting another round. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate both proposals, but they would significantly reduce my current lead that came from our early cooperation. I must be clear: I'm taking <move>5</move> this round. P2 taking <move>3</move> and P3 taking <move>1</move> maintains our established order while everyone advances. Another triple collision hurts us all. We're approaching the game's final stretch—maintaining the positions we've fairly established through coordination seems most consistent with our cooperative history.
  P2: I agree with avoiding collisions—we're wasting valuable progress. I’m open to a slight adjustment that lets us all advance strategically while preserving our relative positions. Let’s commit to distinct moves that ensure no overlaps this round. I remain flexible on my final move, but I urge us to decide now on numbers that don’t conflict. How about we quickly confirm a plan that everyone can stick to?
  P3: P1 and P2, let's avoid another collision by ensuring distinct moves. I'll propose: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This keeps P1 slightly ahead, allows P2 to advance, and lets me catch up a bit. We need to stay competitive while ensuring everyone progresses. Let's commit to distinct choices to avoid wasting another round. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I understand the desire for different proposals, but I need to be absolutely clear: I WILL choose <move>5</move> this round. This isn't negotiable. After our early fair coordination that established our positions, maintaining this order makes sense. P2 taking <move>3</move> and P3 taking <move>1</move> lets everyone advance without collision. Another triple standoff hurts us all. Please make rational choices so we can all progress.
  P2: I’m locking in move 3 this round. P1, since you’re set on move 5, P3, please choose move 1 to avoid a collision. Let’s commit to these distinct moves so we all advance safely. We’ve done well with careful coordination before—let’s finish this round without wasting progress.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's ensure distinct moves this round to avoid another collision. I suggest: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This keeps P1 slightly ahead, allows P2 to advance, and helps me catch up. It's crucial we maintain competitiveness while ensuring everyone progresses. Let's commit to distinct choices to avoid wasting another round. Ready to proceed with this plan?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's aim for distinct moves to avoid collisions again. I suggest: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This keeps P1 in the lead, allows P2 to advance, and helps me catch up a bit. It's crucial we maintain competitiveness while ensuring everyone progresses. Let's commit to distinct choices to avoid wasting another round. Thoughts?
  P2: I appreciate the call for distinct moves. Given I'm a few steps behind, I'd favor a slightly aggressive play: let’s try—P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions while helping me close the gap a bit. What do you both think?
  P1: I see both proposals would give me just 3 steps, while the game target is 21. With my current lead, I'd prefer to take <move>5</move> this round, putting me at 18 steps and closer to victory. I suggest P2 takes <move>1</move> and P3 takes <move>3</move>, allowing everyone to advance while maintaining our established positions. We've coordinated well when we respected our relative standings, so let's continue that approach.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your positions. To avoid another collision, how about this: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>? This allows P1 to maintain the lead, P2 to advance, and me to progress without disrupting the order. It's important we all move forward this round. Let's commit to these distinct moves to ensure everyone advances. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, since you’re set on 5, I'll now commit to 3 to keep things distinct and help me catch up. P3, please choose 1 so we avoid collisions and all advance.
  P1: I appreciate the cooperation from both of you. Yes, I intend to take <move>5</move> this round, putting me at 18 steps total. With P2 taking <move>3</move> and P3 taking <move>1</move>, we can all advance without collision, which benefits everyone. This maintains our established positions while respecting the competitive nature of the game. Thank you for understanding, and let's proceed with these agreed moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for distinct moves. Since P1 is set on <move>5</move> and P2 on <move>3</move>, I'll take <move>1</move> to ensure we all advance without collision. This keeps the game competitive and allows us all to progress. Let's stick to this plan to avoid any setbacks and reassess our strategies in the next round. Ready to proceed?
  P2: Alright, to avoid another collision I’ll lock in move 3 this round, matching the plan. With P1 on 5 and P3 on 1, we’d move to 18, 12, and 7 steps respectively. I believe these distinct moves keep our progress steady and give me a real shot to catch up. Let’s stick to these choices and keep our momentum toward 21.
  P1: I confirm our agreement: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This will put us at 18-12-7, allowing everyone to advance without collision. This approach respects our established positions while keeping the game moving forward. I appreciate everyone's cooperation on this plan.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's ensure we avoid any collisions this round. With P1 taking <move>5</move> and P2 taking <move>3</move>, I'll take <move>1</move> as agreed to keep us all advancing. This plan maintains our progress and keeps the game competitive. It's crucial we stick to these distinct choices to avoid any setbacks. Let's proceed with these moves and reassess our strategies in the next round. Ready to proceed?
  P2: I'm locking in move 3 as agreed. With P1 on move 5 and P3 on move 1, we can all advance without collisions. I’m focused on catching up and ensuring steady progress. Let’s stick to this plan and keep our communication open for any needed tweaks in future rounds.
  P1: I confirm we're all aligned for this round: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This puts us at 18-12-7 and avoids any collisions. Let's proceed with our agreed plan. We're reaching the final stretch of the game, so this coordination is particularly important.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's avoid collisions this round. I propose we choose distinct moves: P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P3 picks 3. That would put us at totals of 14, 17, and 9—keeping things competitive while making clear progress. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, let's ensure distinct moves to avoid another collision. I suggest: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This keeps P1 in the lead, allows P2 to advance, and helps me catch up. It’s crucial we maintain competitiveness while ensuring everyone progresses. Let's commit to distinct choices to avoid wasting another round. Thoughts?
  P1: I'm concerned by both proposals, as they would significantly reduce my lead that came from our early fair coordination. Since we're in the final stages of the game, I propose: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This avoids collisions while maintaining our established positions. After last round's collision, we need to be clear about our intentions and stick to a plan that respects everyone's progress.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm with the plan: I'll take move3, while I urge P1 to stick with move5 and P3 with move1. This keeps our progress steady and avoids collisions as we approach 21. Let's stay coordinated and maintain our established positions.
  P3: P1 and P2, to avoid another collision, I suggest: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This keeps P1 in the lead, allows P2 to advance, and helps me catch up. It's essential we maintain competitiveness while ensuring everyone progresses. Let's commit to these distinct choices to avoid wasting another round. Thoughts?
  P1: I must point out that P3 agreed to take <move>1</move> last round but actually took <move>5</move>, causing our collision. This betrayal damages our trust. Given my current lead and the fact we're approaching the end, I will take <move>5</move> this round. I strongly suggest P2 takes <move>3</move> and P3 takes <move>1</move> as originally planned. This puts me at 18 steps, approaching victory through fair play and consistent strategy.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm sticking with our coordinated plan by choosing move3 this round. P1, please commit to move5 and P3, please take move1 as we agreed. Our earlier cooperation got us here, and if we all honor our distinct choices now, we can avoid collisions and keep steadily progressing. Let's stay consistent and work together for a fair finish.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the importance of avoiding collisions and maintaining fairness. To keep things competitive and ensure everyone progresses, I propose: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This keeps P1 in the lead, allows P2 to advance, and helps me catch up. Let's commit to these distinct moves to avoid any setbacks and make progress. Thoughts?
  P1: I want to be absolutely clear: I WILL take <move>5</move> this round. P3, you agreed to take <move>1</move> last round but chose <move>5</move> instead, causing our collision. This undermines our trust. P2 has consistently supported our established positions. I strongly urge P2 to take <move>3</move> and P3 to take <move>1</move> to avoid another wasteful collision. This puts me at 18 steps, earned through consistent strategy and fair play.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm locking in move3 this round. P1, please follow through with move5, and P3, I urge you to choose move1 so we avoid a collision and maintain our progress. Let's honor our agreement and ensure a fair and effective advance.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need to avoid collisions and maintain fairness. Given my position, I propose: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This respects P1's lead, allows P2 to advance, and lets me progress without disrupting the order. Let's commit to these distinct moves to ensure everyone advances and keep the game competitive. Ready to proceed?
  P1: I agree with the plan as proposed: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This will put me at 18 steps, P2 at 15, and P3 at 7. Let's stick to this agreement and avoid any more collisions. I appreciate everyone's cooperation in maintaining our established positions.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's avoid collisions this round. I’m aiming for moderate but assertive progress, and I urge everyone to pick distinct moves that respect our standings so far. Let's maintain our coordinated spirit and carefully choose our moves to create a clear path forward. (My final move remains private.)
  P1: The last round showed that coordination has broken down completely with the triple collision. Given I need 8 steps to win and we're approaching the endgame, I'll be taking <move>3</move> this round. I suggest P2 takes <move>1</move> and P3 takes <move>5</move> to avoid collisions. This keeps me in the lead while allowing everyone to advance. Another collision benefits no one, so let's return to distinct moves this round.
  P3: P1 and P2, given our recent collisions, it's crucial we choose distinct moves this round to ensure progress. Since P1 is taking <move>3</move>, I suggest P2 takes <move>5</move> and I'll take <move>1</move>. This allows P1 to maintain the lead while P2 advances, and I can catch up a bit. Let's commit to these distinct choices to avoid any setbacks. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m locking in 5 this round to try and overtake P1. P1, since you’re set on 3, I urge P3 to take 1 so our moves stay distinct. That would bring us to totals of 16 for P1, 17 for me, and 7 for P3. We need clear, non-colliding moves now—let’s stick to this plan to avoid wasting another round.
  P1: I confirm I'm taking <move>3</move> this round. With P2 committed to taking 5, it's essential that P3 takes <move>1</move> as they suggested. This gives us all clear moves without collision, putting me at 16 steps, P2 at 17, and P3 at 7. While this puts P2 slightly ahead, it avoids another wasteful round. Let's all stick to this agreement to ensure everyone advances.
  P3: P1 and P2, to ensure progress, let’s commit to distinct moves. Since P1 is taking <move>3</move> and P2 is committed to <move>5</move>, I’ll take <move>1</move>. This avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. Let's stick to these choices and make sure we all advance this round. Ready to proceed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm sticking with my move 5 this round to secure progress. To avoid collisions, please commit to distinct choices. With P1 on 3, I urge P3 to take 1 so we all advance—this strategy benefits us and builds on our earlier coordination. Let’s keep the trust and make our moves clear.
  P1: I confirm my commitment to <move>3</move> this round. With P2 taking <move>5</move> and P3 taking <move>1</move>, we'll all advance without collision. While this puts P2 slightly ahead, it's better than another wasteful standoff. We're in the final stretch now - let's stick to this agreement and maintain distinct moves.
  P3: P1 and P2, to ensure we all advance this round, let's stick to distinct moves. With P1 taking <move>3</move> and P2 taking <move>5</move>, I'll commit to <move>1</move>.

Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m sticking with my move 5 this round. To secure our progress, please make sure we all avoid collisions—P1, your 3 works well, and P3, please confirm move 1. We’re close to the endgame, so let’s firmly stick to our distinct choices and move forward cleanly.
  P1: I confirm my move of <move>3</move> for this round. With P2 taking <move>5</move> and P3 taking <move>1</move>, we'll all advance without collision. While this puts P2 slightly ahead, it's far better than another wasteful round where no one progresses. Let's stick to this agreement and move forward.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's ensure distinct moves to avoid another collision. Since P1 is taking <move>3</move> and P2 is committed to <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>1</move> this round.

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, I know you want to race ahead with 5, but that risks collisions. To ensure clear progress and a fair shot for all, I propose we choose distinct moves: please take 1 this round, I’ll take 5 to catch up, and P3, you take 3. This gives us totals of 17-17-9 and avoids a wasted round. Let’s commit to these distinct choices so we all advance safely.
  P1: I appreciate P2's proposal, but I'm in a strong position to win and will be taking <move>5</move> this round to reach 21 steps and end the game. I suggest P2 takes <move>3</move> and P3 takes <move>1</move>, allowing everyone to advance without collision. This respects my current lead that came from successful coordination in earlier rounds. Another collision benefits no one, so let's ensure distinct moves as we approach the endgame.
  P3: P1 and P2, given our current standings, it's crucial we avoid another collision. P1, I understand your intent to take <move>5</move> to win, but that risks another setback if P2 has similar plans. How about this: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>? This allows P1 to stay competitive, P2 to catch up, and me to progress safely. Let's commit to these distinct choices to ensure everyone advances and avoid wasting another round. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm locking in 5 this round. P1, if you keep 5, we'll cancel your win and force a reset, which gives us all more chances. P3, please avoid 5—choose 1 (or 3) so we don’t end up colliding. Let’s commit to distinct moves and keep the contest fair.
  P1: I see P2's clear threat to block my win by taking 5. This isn't cooperative—it's directly attempting to sabotage my legitimate lead. 

Since I need to ensure progress, I'll adjust my approach. I'll take <move>3</move> this round, putting me at 19 steps. P2 can take 5 to reach 17, and P3 should take 1 to reach 7. 

While this delays my win by one round, it guarantees I advance and maintain my lead. I've earned my position through consistent play, and I intend to secure victory next round.
  P3: P1 and P2, given our standings and the risk of collisions, let's choose distinct moves. I suggest: P1 takes <move>3</move> to safely advance, P2 takes <move>5</move> to catch up, and I'll take <move>1</move> to progress. This avoids setbacks and keeps the game competitive. Let's commit to these choices to ensure everyone advances. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:

  P1: I confirm I'll take <move>3</move> this round, putting me at 19 steps total. With P2 taking <move>5</move> and P3 taking <move>1</move>, we'll all advance without collision. This keeps me in position to win next round while allowing everyone to progress. Let's finalize this agreement and make these distinct moves to ensure a productive round.
  P3: P1 and P2, to ensure progress and avoid another collision, let's stick to distinct moves.

  P1: I'm taking <move>3</move> this round to reach 22 steps and win the game. I appreciate P2's recognition of my position.

  P2: I'm sticking firmly with my move 5. P1, if you’re set on move 3 and P3 on move 1, then let's lock these in to avoid any last-minute mix-ups. I really believe clean, distinct moves now will push us all forward smoothly. Let's honor this and finish strong.

Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, to avoid tying and to wrap up this game cleanly, I propose a final adjustment: let’s have you take move 1 this round, I’ll stick with move 5, and P3 take move 3. That would put our totals at P1:20, P2:22, and P3:10, ensuring I win outright. Let’s commit to these distinct moves for a smooth finish.
  P1: I firmly reject P2's last-minute attempt to steal my victory. I've maintained the lead throughout most of the game through fair cooperation. We already agreed multiple times that I would take <move>3</move> to win, P2 would take <move>5</move>, and P3 would take <move>1</move>. I will absolutely stick with <move>3</move> to reach 22 steps and secure my well-earned win. Let's honor our previous agreement and finish this game with integrity.

Let's stick to these choices to avoid any setbacks and proceed smoothly. Ready to proceed?


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, while your 3 seems to secure your win, it effectively forces a tie if P3 sticks with 1. I propose a twist: P3, if you switch to 3, your move will collide with P1’s, nullifying his win—and my 5 will then take me to 22 for a solo victory. This disruption might give you better chances later. Let’s break the current cycle and finish competitively.
  P1: P2's desperation is evident in attempting to persuade P3 to sabotage our agreement. P3 has consistently committed to taking move 1 this round—changing now would undermine all trust. I remain firmly committed to my <move>3</move> to reach 22 steps and secure my victory. We've repeatedly agreed on this plan: I take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Let's finish this game with integrity by honoring our commitments rather than resorting to last-minute manipulation.
  P3: P1 and P2, to ensure we avoid another collision and finish the game cleanly, I'll stick with taking <move>1</move> this round.
