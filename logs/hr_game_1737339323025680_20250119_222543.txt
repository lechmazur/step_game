Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's establish a strategy. Since we all start at 0, I suggest we try to spread out our moves to avoid collisions. P1, will you take the lead with <move>1</move>? P2, consider <move>3</move>? I'll aim for <move>5</move>. Let's see if we can avoid a clash.
  P1: Okay, that sounds like a reasonable starting point, P3. I'll go with <move>1</move> this round. Let's see how it goes.
  P2: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 stopped talking without committing to a move. P1, are you still on board with our plan? P2, can you confirm if you'll take <move>3</move> as suggested? Let's clarify our intentions to avoid collisions.
  P1: Yes, I'm still on board with the initial plan, P3. Let's stick with <move>1</move> for this round. P2, are you going with <move>3</move>?
  P2: <stop>


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Given P2's immediate stop in Round 2 and the collision in Round 1, I suggest a new strategy. P1, consider moving <move>3</move> this round to spread out. I'll choose <move>1</move> to try and advance without collision. P2, your silence is noted; will you break it and coordinate or continue to disrupt?
  P1: Okay, P3, your suggestion sounds reasonable given the last round. I'll go with <move>3</move> this round. Let's see what P2 does.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P2's continued silence is concerning. P1, let's proceed with our adjusted plan. I'll take <move>1</move> and you take <move>3</move>. P2, your lack of engagement may lead to collisions, hindering your own progress. Consider coordinating to increase your chances of advancing.
  P1: Okay, P3, I'm still planning on moving 3 this round as we discussed. Let's hope P2 makes a move that doesn't cause a collision for any of us.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the current standings, I suggest P1 and I maintain a gap to avoid collisions. P1, consider <move>5</move> to increase your lead. I'll aim for <move>3</move> to catch up. P2, your moves have been unpredictable; will you finally coordinate or continue disrupting our progress?
  P1: Okay, P3, moving 5 sounds good for me this round. P2, it would be helpful if you could indicate your intentions so we can all make progress.
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's reassess. Given P2's history of disrupting our plans, I suggest we both aim for different moves. P1, consider <move>1</move> to ensure progress. I'll choose <move>5</move> to catch up with P2. P2, will you finally coordinate or continue with unpredictable moves?
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P3, moving 1 sounds good to me. Given P2's past moves, it's hard to predict what they'll do, but let's try to make progress.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P3, given P2's continued silence and tendency to pick 5, perhaps we should both avoid that this round. I'm considering <move>3</move>. What are you thinking?
  P3: P1, since P2 is silent again, let's focus on not colliding with each other. You're considering <move>3</move>, I'll think about <move>1</move> to ensure one of us advances. P2's pattern suggests they might go for <move>5</move> again, so let's avoid that to minimize collision risk.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P3, I'm still planning on moving 3 this round to avoid a potential collision with P2. Does <move>1</move> still sound good for you?
  P3: P1, since we're avoiding <move>5</move> and you're on <move>3</move>, I'll confirm <move>1</move> to minimize collision risk. P2's silence suggests they might repeat their pattern, so let's proceed with caution. Our goal is to advance without clashing, increasing our chances of reaching 24 steps first.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P3, sounds like we have a plan to avoid P2 this round. I'm sticking with <move>3</move>. Let's hope this allows us to both advance.
  P3: P1, let's stick to our plan. I'll take <move>1</move> and you take <move>3</move>. P2's consistent silence and pattern of choosing <move>5</move> suggest they'll do the same, so our strategy should help us both advance without collision. Let's proceed cautiously and aim to increase our lead.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P3, I'm definitely going with <move>3</move> this round. Hopefully, this allows us to both make some progress.
  P3: P1, let's finalize our plan. I'll take <move>1</move> and you take <move>3</move>. This should help us both advance without collision, considering P2's likely choice of <move>5</move>. Let's make progress and increase our lead. P2, your silence is noted, but we're proceeding with a strategy to minimize collisions and maximize our chances of winning.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's reassess our strategy. Given the current standings, I suggest P1 aims for <move>5</move> to increase the lead, and I'll choose <move>3</move> to catch up. P2, will you continue with <move>5</move> or change your approach? Coordination can benefit all, but silence may lead to collisions. Let's consider a new plan to advance without clashing.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P3, given P2's likely move of 5 again, I'm hesitant to go for 5 myself. To avoid a collision, I'm considering <move>1</move> this round. What do you think about that, and what are you planning?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, given the standings, I suggest we avoid collisions. P1, consider <move>5</move> to increase your lead. I'll aim for <move>1</move> to catch up. P2, will you change your strategy or continue with <move>5</move>? Let's coordinate to advance without clashing.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P3, given P2's likely move of 5 again, I'm still hesitant to go for 5. To avoid a collision with P2, and possibly you if you go with 1, I think I'll go with <move>3</move> this round. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, considering P2's predictable pattern, taking <move>3</move> might not be the best choice. If P2 picks <move>5</move> again, you'll both collide. I'll stick with <move>1</move> to advance safely. Reconsider your move to avoid collision and increase your lead. P2, your silence is expected, but we're adapting our strategy to minimize collisions and maximize progress.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P3, I see your point about 3 being risky. Given P2's likely 5 and your 1, how about I go with 5 this round? It's a gamble, but if P2 *doesn't* pick 5 for once, I'll make good progress. What do you think of that?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, considering P2's lead, taking a gamble with <move>5</move> might pay off, but it's risky. If P2 picks 5 again, you'll collide. I'll stick with <move>1</move>. P2, your predictable pattern suggests you'll choose 5. Let's see if P1's gamble pays off or if we can make safe progress.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P3, I've reconsidered. Given P2's likely 5 and your plan for 1, I'll go with <move>3</move> this round. That should avoid a collision for both of us. Let's hope P2 sticks with their pattern.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I understand your reconsideration to <move>3</move>. Given P2's lead and predictable pattern, I'll stick with <move>1</move> to ensure safe progress. If P2 collides with you, I'll advance. Let's hope our strategies pay off. P2, your silence is expected, but we're adapting to minimize collisions.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P3, I'm going to stick with <move>3</move> this round. Given P2's pattern, it seems like the safest option to avoid a collision. Let's hope we can both make some progress.


Round 7, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P1, I understand your decision to stick with <move>3</move>. Given P2's lead, I'll confirm my choice of <move>1</move> to ensure progress. If P2 follows their pattern with <move>5</move>, let's hope your gamble doesn't result in a collision. Our goal is to advance without clashing and increase our chances of winning. Let's proceed with caution and adapt to the outcome.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Okay, P3, I'm sticking with <move>3</move> this round. Hopefully, we can both make some progress without colliding with P2.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, considering the current standings, I suggest we focus on catching up with P2. P1, with 12 steps, and me with 9, we need to make strategic moves to close the gap. P2's lead is significant, but if we coordinate, we can potentially limit their progress. Let's discuss a plan to avoid collisions and maximize our advancement.
  P1: Okay, P3, I agree we need to close the gap with P2. Given their recent pattern of picking 5, I'm thinking of going with <move>3</move> this round to avoid a collision. P3, what are you considering? We need to make sure at least one of us advances.
  P2: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, considering P2's significant lead, let's focus on strategic moves. I'll choose <move>5</move> to catch up. If P2 picks 5 again, you taking <move>3</move> ensures one of us advances. P2's silence suggests they'll stick with 5. Let's execute our plan to minimize collisions and close the gap.
  P1: Okay, P3, your plan sounds good. I'll go with <move>3</move> this round. Let's hope P2 sticks with their pattern so at least one of us can advance.
  P2: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, let's confirm our plan. You'll take <move>3</move> and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, if P2 picks 5 again, you'll advance, and if not, I might catch up. P2's consistent silence and pattern suggest they'll choose 5. Let's proceed with our strategy to minimize collisions and close the gap.
  P1: Okay, P3, I'll stick with <move>3</move> as planned. Let's hope P2 continues with 5 so you can make some progress.
  P2: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, our plan is set. I'll take <move>5</move> and you'll take <move>3</move>. Let's hope P2's pattern continues, allowing one of us to advance. P2, your silence is expected, but we're adapting to limit your lead. If you deviate from <move>5</move>, it could change the game's dynamics. Let's see how this round unfolds.
  P1: Okay, P3, just confirming I'm still planning on <move>3</move> this round. Let's hope P2 sticks with their pattern of picking 5 so you can make some good progress with your <move>5</move>. It's crucial we both advance this round to close the gap with P2.
  P2: <stop>


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P3, given P2's consistent 5 and their proximity to winning, I think I'll go with <move>1</move> this round. P3, would you consider <move>3</move>? This should avoid a collision with P2 and hopefully allow one of us to make some progress. What do you think?
  P3: P1, considering P2's lead, taking <move>1</move> might not be aggressive enough. I'll consider <move>5</move> to catch up. If P2 picks 5 again, we'll collide, but if not, I can make significant progress. P2, your pattern suggests you'll choose 5; let's see if you deviate. P1, what's your thoughts on taking a riskier move to close the gap?
  P2: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand the need to catch up, but P2 is dangerously close to winning. Given their consistent <move>5</move>, I'm hesitant to pick that. If you're set on <move>5</move>, I'll go with <move>1</move> to avoid collision. However, if you're willing to consider <move>3</move>, we could both potentially advance if P2 sticks with <move>5</move>. What are your thoughts?
  P3: P1, I understand your caution. Given P2's lead, I'll reconsider <move>3</move> to avoid collision and potentially advance if P2 sticks with <move>5</move>. This could be our last chance to close the gap. P2, your silence is expected, but a change in strategy could surprise us. Let's proceed with caution and adapt to the outcome.
  P2: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P3, so you're leaning towards <move>3</move> then? I think that's a good idea given P2's likely <move>5</move>. Let's both go with that to try and make some progress and stop P2 from reaching 24.
  P3: P1, I agree on <move>3</move> to avoid collision and advance. If P2 deviates from <move>5</move>, we might gain an advantage. Let's hope P2 sticks to their pattern, allowing us to close the gap. P2, any change in strategy now could be crucial. We're proceeding with caution, aiming to limit your lead and stay in the game.
  P2: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, P3, so we're both set on <move>3</move> this round then? Let's do it and hope P2 sticks with <move>5</move> so we can both advance and try to stop them from winning.
  P3: P1, since we're both on <move>3</move>, let's hope P2 sticks with <move>5</move>. If P2 deviates, our plan could backfire. I suggest we're prepared for any outcome and adapt quickly in the next round if necessary. P2, any surprise move now could change the game's course. Let's see how this round unfolds.
  P2: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: Okay, P3, so we are both locked in on <move>3</move> then for this round. Let's hope P2 sticks with <move>5</move> so we can both advance and try to prevent them from reaching 24. This is a crucial round to close the gap.
  P3: P1, since we're both set on <move>3</move>, let's hope for the best. P2, any deviation from <move>5</move> could be a game-changer. I'm prepared for any outcome and will adapt in the next round if necessary. Let's end the conversation and proceed with our planned moves.
  P2: <stop>


Round 9, Move phase:
