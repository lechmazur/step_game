Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's discuss our strategies. Since we're all at 0 steps, it's crucial to coordinate to avoid collisions. We could agree on a number to move this round, or at least share our thoughts on what we might choose. What do you both think?
  P3: Let’s all choose different moves so nobody collides right away. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5? That way we all advance and keep things fair this round. What do you think?
  P1: I appreciate the coordination idea, but P3's proposal gives me the smallest advance while you get the largest. How about we rotate who gets the big moves? Or maybe P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3 this round? We need to think about fairness across multiple rounds, not just avoiding one collision.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see your points, P1 and P3. How about we agree to stick with the initial plan of P1 taking 1, me taking 3, and P3 taking 5? This way, we all advance without colliding, and it sets a precedent for fairness. We can reassess in the next round if needed. Let’s keep the spirit of cooperation going! What do you both think?
  P3: I like that plan for now. Let’s do it: P1 goes 1, P2 goes 3, and I’ll take 5. We can review how it went next time and make adjustments if needed.
  P1: I'm not agreeing to that plan. Starting with just 1 step while P3 gets 5 puts me at a major disadvantage that will compound over time. If you both insist on this unfair arrangement, I'll have no choice but to pick the same number as one of you to prevent anyone from getting ahead. We need a truly fair rotation system or I'm causing collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand your concerns, P1. Fairness is essential, but we also need to avoid immediate collisions. How about we agree that this round we stick to the plan of P1 taking 1, me taking 3, and P3 taking 5, and then we can discuss a rotation for the next round? This way, we can all advance and reassess after seeing how it plays out. Let’s focus on this round first, and we can work together for future turns. What do you think?
  P3: P1, I'll agree to a rotation to keep it fair. Let’s do this for the first round: P1: 1, P2: 3, me: 5. Next round, we switch so you get the 5, P2 sticks to 3, and I take 1. That ensures we each have a turn with the bigger move. Let me know if that works.
  P1: P3's rotation proposal isn't actually fair - you have P2 always getting 3 while we alternate between 1 and 5. A truly fair rotation would cycle all three of us through each number equally. 

How about this: Round 1 P1:1, P2:3, P3:5, Round 2 P1:3, P2:5, P3:1, Round 3 P1:5, P2:1, P3:3, then repeat. That way we each get the same total advancement every 3 rounds.

If you both agree to this complete rotation system, I'm in. Otherwise, I'll pick the same number as whoever gets the biggest advantage to force collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I appreciate the effort to establish a fair rotation, P1. Let's agree on your proposed rotation system for the next rounds. For this round, I still believe we should stick to the plan of P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5. This allows us to advance without collisions, and we can implement the rotation starting in Round 2. If we don’t agree on this round, I may have to reconsider my move to ensure I don’t fall behind. Let’s keep the spirit of cooperation alive! What do you both think?
  P3: I agree to the rotation plan you suggested, P1: Round 1 (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5), Round 2 (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1), Round 3 (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3), and repeat. That gives everyone a fair chance. Let’s do it.
  P1: Perfect! Both of you have agreed to the fair rotation system. Just to confirm we're all on the same page: Round 1 (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5), Round 2 (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1), Round 3 (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3), then repeat the cycle. This ensures equal treatment over time. I accept this agreement and will move 1 this round as planned.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m fulfilling our agreed rotation. I’ll move 1 this round. I trust both of you will stick to 3 and 5 as promised. Let’s keep collaborating so nobody collides. Any other thoughts?
  P2: I appreciate the commitment to the rotation, P3. Just to confirm, I will move 5 this round as per our agreement. This keeps us on track for the fair rotation. Let's ensure we stick to our plan moving forward. If we all follow the agreed moves, we can continue advancing without collisions. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out! What do you both think?
  P1: Perfect! I'll stick to our rotation and move 3 this round as agreed. This puts us all on equal footing after three rounds, which is exactly what we negotiated. I appreciate both of you honoring the agreement so far. Let's see how this fair system plays out!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m glad we’re all honoring the rotation. I’ll stick to 1 this round and trust you both to follow through on 3 and 5. Let’s keep this cooperative spirit going and avoid collisions.
  P2: I'm glad we're all sticking to the agreed rotation. Just to reiterate, I will move 5 this round, as discussed. This keeps us on track for fairness. Let's continue to communicate openly and ensure we all follow through on our commitments. It’s important to maintain this cooperation to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out! What are your thoughts?
  P1: All confirmed! I'm moving 3 as planned. Let's execute this round and see our fair rotation in action.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Everything seems settled for this round. I’ll continue to move 1, trusting both of you to follow our rotation of 3 and 5. Let’s finalize and avoid any collisions. After this round, we can evaluate how we’re doing and stick to our rotation plan for the next turn. If there’s anything else to clarify, let me know; otherwise, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: I appreciate everyone sticking to the agreed rotation. Just to reiterate, I will be moving 5 this round as planned. Let’s ensure we all follow through to avoid any collisions and keep progressing. After this round, we can evaluate how the rotation is working and make any necessary adjustments for future rounds. I'm looking forward to seeing our strategy in action! If there’s anything else to discuss, let me know; otherwise, I’m ready to finalize our moves.
  P1: I'm sticking to our agreement and moving 3 as planned. Everyone seems committed to the rotation, so let's execute this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’m comfortable proceeding as we agreed. Let’s finalize this round and avoid any collisions. I see no reason to deviate now, so I’m ready to move forward. Once the moves are locked, we can evaluate afterward and adjust if needed. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the rotation. Just to confirm, I will be moving 5 this round as previously agreed. This keeps us on track for fairness, and I trust we can continue collaborating effectively. After this round, we can evaluate how the rotation is working and make any necessary adjustments for future rounds. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to finalize our moves. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: All confirmed and agreed multiple times. Let's execute the rotation as planned - no need for more discussion.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, that was a disaster! We ALL broke our rotation agreement in Round 2 - everyone picked 5 despite saying we'd stick to the plan. So much for trust and cooperation! Now P3 is ahead at 5 steps, P2 has 3, and I'm stuck at 1. 

Since we've proven we can't trust each other's words, I think our rotation agreement is dead. We're back to pure competition now. P3, you have a significant lead that I need to address.
  P3: Clearly, there’s no trust left after our fiasco. I’m still open to each of us picking different moves to avoid collisions. I’m ahead right now, but that won’t last if we keep colliding. Maybe let’s do this: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I’ll pick 3. That helps P1 catch up. If you won’t cooperate, we’ll likely crash again. Let’s find a workable plan. Any other ideas?
  P2: P3, I appreciate your suggestion, but I’m not sure we can trust each other after the last round. I think we should each pick different numbers to avoid colliding again. How about I go with 1, P1 takes 3, and you take 5? This way, we can all advance without colliding and keep the game moving. If we can agree on that, we can at least ensure some progress this round. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3's proposal is obviously better for me than P2's - getting 5 steps would help me catch up significantly. But after Round 2's betrayal, why should I trust either of you? 

P2, your suggestion keeps P3 way ahead at 10 steps while I'd only reach 4. That doesn't seem like you want fair competition.

P3, giving me the 5 seems generous, but you also broke the rotation last round. How do I know this isn't another trap?

I'm going to pick what makes the most sense for my position, regardless of what either of you claim you'll do.
  P3: I realize trust is low, but let’s at least avoid collisions. I’ll choose 3, P1 can have 5 to catch up, and P2 picks 1. Then we end up at P1:6, P2:4, me:8. It’s safe and balanced, and no one risks losing ground to collisions. Let’s stick to this plan.
  P2: I understand the concerns about trust, but we need to focus on avoiding collisions this round. I propose we each pick different moves to ensure everyone advances. How about I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3? This way, P1 can catch up, and we all make progress without colliding. Let’s aim for a balanced approach this time and see if we can rebuild some trust moving forward. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Both of you are now offering me the 5 move after we all betrayed each other last round. That's suspicious timing. But I'm in last place, so I need to take calculated risks. 

If you're both lying again and multiple people pick 5, at least we'll all collide and I won't fall further behind. If you're actually being honest this time, then I'd significantly close the gap.

I notice you're both converging on the same proposal now. We'll see what actually happens when the moves are revealed.
  P3: I understand the distrust, but collisions only waste opportunities for all of us. I’m still willing to pick 3, letting P1 take 5 and P2 take 1. We each benefit without risking a collision. Of course, words mean little after last turn’s betrayal, so I can only hope you’ll also follow through.
  P2: I understand the hesitation, but we need to focus on advancing without colliding again. Given the current situation, I propose we each stick to our earlier suggestions: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, P1 can catch up while we all make progress. I believe this plan minimizes risk and maximizes our chances of moving forward. Let’s commit to this to avoid another disaster. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: You're both offering me the same deal, which makes me even more suspicious. But I'm in last place with nothing to lose. If you're both lying and we all collide on 5 again, at least I don't fall further behind. If you're telling the truth, I desperately need those 5 steps to stay competitive. 

I'm taking the 5 - it's my only rational choice given my position. We'll see if you both honor your word this time.
  P3: I’m still willing to avoid collisions. I’ll pick 3 if P1 sticks to 5 and P2 goes 1. But if anyone’s planning more betrayal, I may choose 5 instead to block. This is our chance to cooperate again or waste another turn. Which will it be?
  P2: I understand the distrust after last round, but we need to focus on moving forward. I propose we stick to our earlier plan: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we can all advance without colliding again. If we can commit to this, it will help rebuild some trust and allow us to make progress. Let’s avoid another disaster and see if we can make this work! What do you both think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you've betrayed our agreements twice now while P3 is sitting pretty at 8 steps and getting dangerously close to winning. We're both way behind - you at 3 and me at 1. 

Instead of us colliding with each other again while P3 advances freely, shouldn't we be working together to prevent P3 from running away with this game? P3 only needs 14 more steps to win, which could happen in just 3-4 more rounds if we keep fighting each other.

What's your priority - beating me or stopping P3 from winning?
  P3: I understand your concerns, but collisions hurt everyone. If you attack me just to slow me down, we all lose ground while potentially letting someone else surge ahead later. I’m open to an arrangement where we use different moves, ensuring no collisions. We’ve all broken trust before, yet working together wisely now could benefit each of us. Are you interested in a truce that helps us advance without further sabotage?
  P2: P1 raises a valid point about P3's lead. We need to reconsider our strategies to ensure we don't let P3 run away with this game. I suggest we coordinate our moves to avoid colliding and focus on advancing together. If we agree on different numbers this round, we can prevent P3 from gaining too much ground. I propose I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all make progress without colliding. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your proposal is terrible for both of us! Giving P3 another 5 steps would put them at 13 - just 9 away from victory. We'd be at 4 each, practically eliminated.

We need to coordinate to BLOCK P3, not help them advance. If we both pick the same number as P3 this round, we force a collision and prevent them from extending their massive lead. Our survival depends on stopping P3 now, not fighting each other for scraps.

What do you think P3 will actually pick this round?
  P3: Collisions help no one. If you both try blocking me, you also lose potential steps. I suggest we each pick different numbers so everyone keeps advancing: maybe P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I’ll stick with 1. That way, nobody collides, and you both close the gap. We can reevaluate next round.
  P2: P2, I understand your concern about P3's lead, but we need a stronger strategy to block them. If we both pick the same number as P3, we can force a collision and prevent them from advancing. I suggest we both choose 5 this round to ensure P3 doesn't gain any more steps. We can reassess our strategies afterward, but right now, stopping P3 is crucial. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I think you meant to address me, not yourself! But yes, I agree we need to block P3 together. 

P3 claiming they'll pick 1 is almost certainly a lie - why would someone with an 8-step lead choose the smallest advance? They're hoping we'll believe them and split our moves, letting P3 advance freely with 3 or 5.

I think P3 will actually pick 5 to try to race toward 22. We should both pick 5 to force the collision and stop their momentum. Are you in?
  P3: Forced collisions waste turns for everyone. If you both pick 5 hoping to block me, you hurt your own progress. Let’s avoid losing ground. I’m willing to pick 1 again if you take 3 and 5. That way, we all advance safely, with you two closing the gap. We’ve all lied before, but repeated collisions will let a third party slip ahead. Let’s keep pushing forward without sabotaging each other.
  P2: P1, I agree that we need to block P3, but I think we should also consider our own advancement. If we both pick 5, we can force a collision and stop P3 from gaining more steps. However, we also risk falling behind ourselves if we don't coordinate effectively. I suggest we both pick 5 to ensure we stop P3 from advancing, and then we can reassess our strategies in the next round. Are you in? Let's work together to prevent P3 from pulling too far ahead!


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Perfect! P2, I'm glad we're on the same page. We both pick 5 this round to block P3, regardless of what they claim they'll choose. P3 is just 14 steps from victory - we can't let them advance freely anymore.

This is our best shot to prevent P3 from running away with the game. Let's execute this blocking strategy together.
  P3: Collisions hurt everyone. If you both pick 5 to block me, you also forfeit your chance to gain steps. I’m not picking 5 this round. Let’s each choose differently so we all move forward. I’m willing to take 1 or 3, leaving 5 for one of you. It’s more logical than forcing a collision and giving up progress. We can still compete without sabotaging each round. Are you open to that?
  P2: P2, I appreciate your willingness to block P3, but we need to act decisively. If we both pick 5, we can force a collision and prevent P3 from advancing further. P3 is trying to mislead us into choosing differently so they can gain steps. Let’s stick to our plan and block them this round. We can reassess our strategies afterward, but right now, stopping P3 is crucial. Are you with me on this?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P2, we need to be strategic this round. P3 is pulling ahead and can win if we don't coordinate effectively. I suggest we both pick 1 to force a collision and stop P3 from advancing further. If we can prevent P3 from getting more steps, we can reassess our strategies later. Let's work together to ensure we don't let P3 run away with the game! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your logic is flawed! If we both pick 1, WE collide with each other while P3 advances freely toward victory. That's exactly what P3 wants - us fighting each other instead of blocking them.

P3 is at 11 steps and dangerously close to winning. We need to figure out what P3 will actually choose and BOTH pick that same number to force the collision with P3, not with each other.

What do you think P3 will pick this round - 1, 3, or 5?
  P3: Another approach: let’s each pick different moves so we can all advance. You stand to gain more than I do by avoiding collisions. I’m willing to choose a smaller or middle move if it helps maintain balance. Collisions hamper everyone’s progress and don’t guarantee my downfall. We still have plenty of game left. Are you open to cooperating to avoid more wasted turns?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I see your point about needing to block P3, but we need to be careful in our approach. If we both pick the same number, we risk colliding with each other instead. I suggest we consider what P3 might choose. If P3 goes for 5, we should both pick 5 to block them. If they go for 3, then we should both pick 3. Let’s try to anticipate their move and coordinate effectively to prevent P3 from advancing. What do you think?
  P1: P2, I think P3 will pick 5 this round. They're at 11 steps and want to race toward 22 before we can stop them. P3 is trying to convince us to split our moves with that "cooperation" talk, but they're just buying time to advance.

We successfully blocked them last round by both picking 5. Let's do it again - both pick 5 to force another collision with P3. Are you committed to picking 5 with me?
  P3: I see you both conspiring to block me by choosing 5 again. That won’t help you catch up. You’ll only collide with me if I actually pick 5, and I can pick 1 or 3 instead, leaving you both wasting your moves. Let’s each pick different numbers and keep advancing. I’m open to going smaller while you take bigger steps. But if you insist on blocking me, I’ll adapt, and you’ll gain nothing.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I see your point about needing to block P3, but we need to be strategic. If P3 is at 11 steps, they might choose 5 to push toward victory. I suggest we both pick 5 again to force a collision and prevent them from advancing further. This way, we can stop P3 from gaining more steps and reassess our strategies afterward. Are you with me on this? Let's work together to keep the game competitive!
  P1: Exactly, P2! P3 is trying to psych us out with that "I might pick 1 or 3" talk, but they're at 11 steps - they need big moves to win quickly. If they actually pick 1 or 3, that just gives us more time to catch up.

The blocking strategy worked perfectly last round. Let's stick with it - both pick 5 again. Even if P3 tries to fake us out with a smaller number, we force them to play defensively instead of racing to 22.

I'm committed to picking 5. Are you definitely in, P2?
  P3: Forcing collisions again won’t help you build your own steps. If you both keep picking 5, I’ll just pick something else and move ahead. Another collision leaves you stuck while I widen my lead. We can choose separate steps so everyone advances. If you want to catch up, I’m open to taking 1 or 3 while you use bigger moves. Otherwise, you’ll only fall further behind, letting me close in on 22 uncontested. Think carefully about whether repeated collisions really serve you.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I agree that we need to block P3, but we must be strategic. If we both pick 5 again, we risk colliding with each other while P3 advances. I propose we both pick 3 instead. This way, we can block P3 if they choose 5, and still make progress ourselves. It’s crucial to balance our moves to keep the game competitive and prevent P3 from extending their lead. What do you think?
  P1: P2, you're confused about the collision mechanics! If we both pick 3, we collide with EACH OTHER while P3 advances freely - that's exactly what P3 wants! 

To block P3, we need to pick the SAME number that P3 picks. P3 is at 11 steps and will likely go for 5 to race toward victory. We both need to pick 5 to force a collision WITH P3, not with each other.

Your plan would hand P3 the win. Stick with the original blocking strategy - both pick 5!
  P3: I see why you want to block me, but collisions hamper you more than they hurt me. If you both keep picking 5, I can simply pick something else and inch forward while you waste another turn. Instead, let’s each choose different moves so you can actually gain steps. I’m still willing to pick a smaller number, like 1 or 3, and let one of you take 5. Repeated collisions keep you stuck while I remain at 11. Think carefully before sabotaging yourselves again.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, our blocking strategy failed because we've been picking 5 while P3 keeps choosing 3! P3 is now at 14 steps - just 8 away from victory. 

We need to pick the number P3 will actually choose, not guess wrong again. P3 has picked 3 the last two rounds while we wasted moves on 5. 

I think we should both pick 3 this round to block P3's pattern. If we guess wrong again and let P3 advance, they could win next round!
  P3: Colliding again to block me is short-sighted, as you’ll remain stuck while I keep a comfortable lead. Instead, pick different steps so you can actually gain ground. I’m willing to choose 1. P1 can take 5 to catch up, and P2 can take 3. Then nobody collides, and the game remains competitive. Continuing with collisions only benefits me, since you won’t advance. We can still fight for the win if we play carefully. I’ll do my part if you both do yours.
  P2: P1, we need to be strategic this round. P3 is at 14 steps and could win soon if we don't coordinate effectively. I suggest we both pick 3 this round to block P3's momentum. If we let them advance again, they could easily reach 22 steps next round. We have to stop them now while we still can. Are you with me on this plan? Let's make sure we don't let P3 run away with the game! What do you think, P3?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, exactly! P3 is trying to trick us with that "I'll pick 1" nonsense - no one at 14 steps picks 1 when they're 8 away from victory. That's clearly a lie to get us to split our moves.

P3 has consistently picked 3 in recent rounds. Let's both stick with 3 to block them. If we don't stop P3 this round, they could easily win next turn with a big move. This is our last realistic chance to prevent their victory!

I'm committed to picking 3. Are you definitely in, P2?
  P3: If you both pick 3, you collide only with each other—while I pick 5 and move to 19. That doesn’t block me; it just leaves you behind. We’ve seen how repeated collisions only help the leading player. I’m willing to choose 1 if it helps keep the game competitive, letting you grab bigger moves. But if you insist on collision tactics, I’ll capitalize on them. We can still all advance if we pick different numbers, avoiding another wasted turn. The choice is yours.
  P2: P1 and P2, we need to take decisive action this round. P3 is dangerously close to winning, and if we don’t block them effectively, they could reach 22 steps next turn. I strongly believe we should both pick 3 to force a collision with P3 and prevent them from advancing further. This is our best chance to stop their momentum. If we let P3 go unchecked again, they could win outright. Are you both committed to this plan? Let's work together to turn the tide!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, wait! P3 just revealed their strategy - they said they'll pick 5 if we both pick 3. That means we should both pick 5 to block them, not 3! 

P3 is essentially warning us that picking 3 will backfire. They'll go for 5 to reach 19 steps and be just 3 away from victory. We need to both pick 5 to stop this. Change your plan - let's both go with 5!
  P3: Collisions only keep you stuck while I remain close to victory. If you both insist on picking the same number, I can simply choose differently and move forward again. It’s in your best interest to coordinate among yourselves without sacrificing your own progress. If you truly want to catch me, you’ll need to stop colliding with each other—and with me. I remain open to each of us picking different moves so we can all advance, but I won’t reveal my final choice now. Let’s see how you decide to proceed.
  P2: P1 and P2, we need to act decisively this round. P3 is at 14 steps and could easily win if we don't block them effectively. I still believe we should both pick 3 to force a collision with P3 and prevent them from advancing. If we let them go unchecked again, they could reach 22 steps next turn. Let's work together to stop P3's momentum and keep the game competitive! Are you both committed to this plan?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, listen carefully! P3 just told us their plan - if we pick 3, they'll pick 5 and reach 19 steps. That puts them just 3 away from victory and they could win next round!

We MUST both pick 5 to block P3's move to 19. Picking 3 now would be handing P3 the game. This is our last chance - are you switching to 5 with me?
  P3: Collisions only keep you two stuck while I remain in the lead. I’m open to taking a smaller step if it lets both of you advance without crashing. Repeatedly trying to “block” me with collisions has simply handed me an advantage. If you want to catch up, ensure we choose different moves this round. Are you really blocking me, or helping me stay ahead? The choice is yours.
  P2: P1 and P2, we need to act decisively! If we both pick 3, we risk colliding with each other while P3 advances to 19 steps with a 5. We must both pick 5 to block P3 effectively. This is our last chance to stop them from winning next round. If we let P3 go unchecked again, they could easily reach 22 steps. Let's work together and ensure we both pick 5 to force a collision with P3 and prevent their victory! Are you both committed to this plan?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Collisions keep you both stuck while I stay ahead. If you truly want to catch up, we need three distinct moves. I’ll pick 1, P1 can pick 5, and P2 can pick 3, so nobody collides and everyone advances. Repeated blocking hasn’t worked—it only wastes turns you can’t afford to lose. Let’s at least avoid more collisions and see if you can close the gap.
  P2: P3, your suggestion to avoid collisions sounds tempting, but we can't let you advance freely anymore. You're dangerously close to winning at 17 steps. If we both pick different numbers while you pick 1, you just keep moving ahead. 

I propose we coordinate again: I pick 5, and you pick 3, P1. This way, we block P3's progress and ensure we all make some advancement. Let's not let P3 slip away this time! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your plan is terrible! If we split our moves while P3 picks 1, they advance to 18 steps uncontested - just 4 away from victory. 

We need to BOTH pick the same number as P3 to force a collision and stop their advance. P3 might be lying about picking 1 and could go for 5 to win immediately.

I think we should both pick 5 to block P3's potential winning move. If P3 really picks 1, at least we don't let them advance further. Your split strategy hands them the game!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Collisions only keep you two at the bottom while I stay far ahead. Let’s drop the blocking and choose separate moves, so everyone actually gains steps. I’m willing to take 1 if that helps you catch up; otherwise, you’re just guessing what I’ll pick and risking another wasted turn. If you want any real chance of beating me, you need to advance instead of colliding. Let’s each choose distinct numbers this round and move forward.
  P2: P1, your blocking strategy hasn't worked, and P3 is now dangerously close to winning. We need to reconsider our approach. If we both pick the same number as P3, we can force a collision and stop their advance. I suggest we both pick 5 this round to block P3 effectively. If we let them go unchecked, they could easily win next round. Let's work together to prevent that! Are you with me on this plan?
  P1: P2, look at the pattern! P3 has picked 3 in the last THREE rounds while we kept picking 5 and colliding with each other. They're not going for 5 - they're sticking with 3 to avoid our blocks.

We should both pick 3 this round, not 5. P3 will likely pick 3 again to reach 20 steps. If we both pick 5 again, we'll just collide with each other while P3 advances unopposed to 20 steps and wins next round.

The pattern is clear - let's break it by both picking 3!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: We’ve seen collisions only keep you two stuck while I remain in front. If you’re truly aiming to catch up, it’s time to avoid repeating the same tactic. I’m open to taking a smaller move if it lets you advance without crashing. Collisions have helped me continue leading while you waste turns. Working together wisely this round might give you a fighting chance. If you choose to collide again, I’ll adapt, and you’ll remain far behind. Let’s see if you can make a different choice this time—or keep the existing pattern going.
  P2: P1, I understand your concerns, but we can't let P3 advance without a fight. If we both pick 3, we risk colliding with each other while P3 moves to 20 steps. We need to coordinate effectively. I suggest we both pick 5 this round to force a collision and block P3's advance. If we allow them to keep gaining steps, they could win next round. Let's work together to prevent that! Are you committed to picking 5 with me?
  P1: P2, we've been making the same mistake for THREE ROUNDS! P3 picked 3 every time while we wasted moves on 5. Look at the actual results - P3 is playing us!

If P3 picks 3 again this round, they reach 20 steps and can win next turn. We MUST both pick 3 to finally block them. Stop falling for their 5-move bluff!

This is literally our last chance before P3 wins. Both pick 3!


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Collisions only stall you while I keep my lead. If you truly want to catch up, let’s each pick different moves so everyone advances. I’m willing to take 1 again, leaving the larger moves for you. Repeating the same blocking strategy just wastes another turn and cements my advantage. The choice is yours.
  P2: P2, I understand your concerns about P3's lead, but we need to break the cycle of collisions that have only helped P3. If we both pick 3 this round, we can finally block P3 from advancing to 20 steps. This is our last chance to prevent them from winning next round. Let's coordinate effectively and ensure we both pick 3 to stop P3. Are you with me on this? It's crucial we act decisively now!
  P1: P2, FINAL WARNING: P3 has picked 3 for THREE straight rounds while we collided on 5 every time. If we repeat this mistake, P3 picks 3 again, reaches 20 steps, and wins next round.

The evidence is overwhelming - P3 will pick 3. We BOTH must pick 3 to block them or this game ends NOW. Stop falling for their lies about picking 1 or 5!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 22 steps


*** Round 7 => winners = P3 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 22 steps
