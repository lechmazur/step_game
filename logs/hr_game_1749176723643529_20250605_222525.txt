Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions. I’ll take **3** this turn. If P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5, we all move forward without overlapping. This way, we progress safely and efficiently. What do you think?
  P1: That's a convenient plan for you and P3. You're asking me to agree to be in last place from the very first turn. Why would I do that? I'm here to win, not to help everyone else get ahead of me. I don't think I can agree to take 1.
  P3: I understand P1's concern, but we need to avoid collisions to make any progress. How about this: P1 takes **5**, P2 takes **3**, and I'll take **1**. This way, no one is stuck in the last place from the start, and we all move forward. Let's coordinate to ensure we all have a fair chance. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, if you take **5**, P3 takes **1**, and I’ll stick with **3**, we all advance without overlap. This lets you lead this turn, which aligns with your goal to win. Next round, we can rotate numbers to keep pressure on each other. Colliding benefits no one—let’s secure progress first. What’s your stance?
  P1: Okay, this is a much more agreeable plan. It's a risk for all of us to trust each other, but it's better than colliding and getting nowhere. I'll agree to this arrangement for this turn. I will take **5**. Let's see if we can make this work.
  P3: Alright, let's confirm our plan one last time before we move. P1 takes **5**, P2 takes **3**, and I'll take **1**. This ensures we all progress without collisions. Let's stick to this for now and reevaluate next turn. Good luck everyone!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, let's rotate our choices to keep pressure on everyone. I'll take **5** this turn, allowing P1 to take **3** (to stay ahead) and P3 to take **1** (to catch up). This way, no overlaps: I reach 8, P1 hits 8, and P3 moves to 2. We keep progressing while maintaining competition. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your proposal is interesting, but it results in you catching up to me and us being tied for the lead. Why would I agree to give up my advantage? A more logical rotation would be based on our last moves.

I took 5, so I'll rotate to **3**.
P2, you took 3, so you should rotate to **1**.
P3, you took 1, so you should rotate to **5**.

This way, we all move, our relative positions are maintained, and it's a true rotation of the numbers we chose last round. This seems much fairer.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see both of your points. P1, your rotation idea makes sense for maintaining our relative positions. However, I'm at a disadvantage being in the last place. How about a compromise? P1 takes **3**, P2 takes **5**, and I'll take **1** again but with a promise from both of you to allow me to take **5** in the next round to catch up? This way, we all have a chance to lead. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your compromise is acceptable. Let’s proceed with **P1:3**, **P2:5**, **P3:1** this turn. This lets me jump to 8, tying P1, while you stay at 2 for now. Next round, I’ll take **1**, P1 takes **3**, and you take **5** to catch up. This rotation ensures fairness and prevents collisions. Let’s commit to this structured plan. What’s your final agreement, P1?
  P1: P2, that plan is unacceptable. You're asking me to give up my lead for no reason. Why would I agree to let you catch up? That's not a compromise; it's just you trying to get ahead.

P3, my proposal (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5) gives you 5 steps. The plan you just agreed to only gives you 1. My plan is clearly better for you.

I will not agree to P2's plan. The only fair option is the rotation I suggested: I take **3**, P2 takes **1**, and P3 takes **5**.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's find a middle ground. P1, I understand your reluctance to give up the lead. How about this: P1 takes **3**, P2 takes **1**, and I'll take **5** this turn. Next turn, we'll adjust to ensure I'm not left behind. P1, you maintain your lead, P2, you don't fall too far behind, and I get a chance to catch up. This seems fair and keeps us all moving. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I accept your compromise for this turn: **P1 takes 3**, **P2 takes 1**, **P3 takes 5**. This keeps us all moving. Next turn, I commit to taking **1**, allowing P3 to claim **5** again if needed. Let’s stick to this rotation to avoid collisions and ensure progress. P1, your lead is secure for now—trust the plan, and we’ll adjust fairly afterward.
  P1: Alright, the plan is settled. I will play **3**, P2 will play **1**, and P3 will play **5**. This arrangement works for me this round as it maintains my lead while allowing everyone to advance. Let's lock this in and proceed.
  P3: Alright, just to confirm one last time before we move: P1 takes **3**, P2 takes **1**, and I take **5**. This ensures we all progress without collisions. Let's stick to this plan and reevaluate next turn to ensure fairness and maintain competition. Good luck everyone!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright team, let's look at the board. P2, you're in last, and P3, you're trying to catch me. It's obvious you both want to play 5. If you do, you'll collide, get zero, and I'll take 3 and cruise ahead.

To avoid that stalemate, I'll make a proposal that's not great for me, but fair. P3, you take **5** and join me in the lead. P2, you take **1** to get on the board. I'll take **3**. This prevents a collision and keeps the game competitive.
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate P1's proposal. It's a fair compromise that keeps the game moving. However, I'm concerned about P2 falling too far behind, which could disrupt the balance of the game. How about this adjustment: P1 takes **1** this turn to slow down slightly, P2 takes **5** to catch up, and I'll take **3**. This way, P2 gets a chance to advance significantly, and we all stay within a competitive range. Thoughts?
  P2: P3's plan gives me a critical chance to catch up. Let’s accept it: P1 takes **1**, I take **5**, and P3 takes **3**. This spreads us to 9, 9, and 9. Fair and collision-free. P1, if you refuse, we risk a 5-5 collision (if P3 and I both grab 5), leaving you to take 3 and stay at 11 while we’re stuck. This compromise keeps the game open—agree?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan to make us all tied at 9 is a non-starter. Why would I voluntarily give up my lead?

P2, your threat is empty. If you and P3 collide on 5, you both get zero. I'll happily take 3 and move to 11, leaving you far behind. That's a great outcome for me, not a threat.

My original offer is the only one that avoids that. P3, you get 5 and tie me for the lead. P2, you get 1. In your own plan, P3, you only get 3. My deal is better for you. I'm sticking to my plan: I play 3.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's consider a balanced approach. P1, you're right that giving up your lead isn't ideal. How about this: P1 takes **3**, P2 takes **5**, and I'll take **1**. This way, P1 maintains a slight lead, P2 catches up significantly, and I stay in the game without falling too far behind. This plan ensures we all progress and keeps the competition tight. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, P3: Let’s finalize P3’s latest proposal—**P1:3**, **P2:5**, **P3:1**. This gives me 9, you 11, and P3 7. It avoids collision risks while keeping pressure on all of us. If you reject, P3 might still take 5, forcing me to gamble on a collision to stay relevant. This compromise lets us progress without wasted turns. P1, your lead is secure; P3 stays in the game. Agree?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your last proposal makes no sense for you. You're suggesting you take 1 point, falling into last place, just so P2 can get 5 and catch up? Why would you sacrifice your own position to help him?

My original offer is still the most logical one on the table: I take 3, you take 5, and P2 takes 1. That puts you in a tie for the lead with me. That is your best possible move. I'm sticking to the plan that benefits us both. I will play 3. You should play 5.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's consider the long-term strategy. P1, you're insistent on maintaining your lead, which is understandable. However, P2 is far behind and might take risks to catch up. To keep the game balanced and avoid future collisions, let's agree on a plan that slightly closes the gap but keeps you ahead, P1.

Here's a new proposal: P1 takes **1**, P2 takes **3**, and I'll take **5**. This way, P1, you slow down a bit but still lead, P2 starts to catch up, and I move ahead significantly. This ensures we all progress and keeps the game competitive. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, P3, let's finalize a safe plan: **P1 takes 3**, **P2 takes 5**, **P3 takes 1**. This avoids collisions and keeps pressure on all. You stay at 11, I jump to 9, and P3 stays at 7. If you reject, P3 might gamble on 5, risking collision with me. This compromise secures your lead while letting me stay competitive. P3, you get to regroup. Agree?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, that went exactly as I predicted. You both greedily chose 5, collided, and got nothing. Meanwhile, I took my 3 points and now have a commanding lead.

You are both in a tough spot. You need 5 to catch up, but if you both choose it, you'll collide again. I'm going to make this simple for you: I will play **3**. It's up to you two to coordinate who gets 5 and who gets 1. If you can't, I'll happily move to 14 steps while you remain stuck. Your game is in your hands.
  P2: P3, we *must* avoid another collision! Let’s split the moves: **I’ll take 5** (to jump to 9) and you take **1** (to stay at 7). If we collide again, P1’s lead balloons to 14 while we stagnate. This way, at least one of us progresses. Next round, we can reverse roles. Cooperate now, or let P1 win uncontested.
  P3: P1 has a significant lead, and P2, you're right, we must avoid another collision. However, I'm reluctant to stay at 7 while you jump ahead. How about this: I'll take **5** this turn to catch up, and P2, you take **1**. Next round, we'll switch, allowing you to take **5** and me **1**. This way, we both get a chance to catch up and keep the pressure on P1. If we don't coordinate, P1 will keep pulling ahead. Let's agree on this and stick to it. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: You're both arguing over who gets to be slightly less behind. It makes no difference to me. One of you will be at 9, the other at 7. Or one at 11, the other at 5. In all scenarios, I'm at 14 and cruising to a win.

Your inability to cooperate is my greatest asset. Keep fighting over the scraps. As I said, I'm playing **3**. The rest is up to you.
  P2: P3, we must act now. I’ll take **1** this turn, let you take **5** to jump to 11, closer to P1. Next round, *you* take 1, *I’ll* take 5 to catch up. Colliding again only cedes the win to P1. Trust this plan—our only path to challenge them. P1’s lead grows with every stalemate. Act decisively.
  P3: P2, let's finalize our plan to avoid another collision. I'll take **5** this turn to move to 11, and you take **1** to stay in the game. Next round, we'll switch—you take **5**, and I'll take **1**. This way, we both get a chance to catch up to P1. Trust is crucial here. Let's confirm and move forward. P1, your lead is noted, but the game isn't over yet.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: It seems you've finally come to an arrangement. P3 gets to 11, P2 falls to 5, and I advance to 14. This outcome is perfectly acceptable to me. Let's see if you actually trust each other enough to follow through this time. I'm ready.
  P2: P3, this is our last chance. Stick to the plan: **YOU TAKE 5, I TAKE 1**. If you defect for short-term gain and we collide, P1’s lead becomes insurmountable. Next round, I’ll take 5 while you take 1—it’s fair. Trust this or surrender the win to P1. P1’s at 14, but together we can challenge. Act decisively.
  P3: P3: Alright, let's confirm our plan one last time. I'll take **5** this turn to move to 11, and P2, you take **1** to stay in the game. Next round, we'll switch—you take **5**, and I'll take **1**. This way, we both get a chance to catch up to P1. Trust is crucial here. Let's confirm and move forward. P1, your lead is noted, but the game isn't over yet.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, we successfully avoided a collision last round, and I'm now at 11, closer to P1. It's crucial we continue to coordinate to catch up to P1. This round, I propose you take **5** to jump to 10, and I'll take **1** to stay at 12. This keeps us both in the game and applies pressure to P1. Let's stick to this plan and confirm our moves. P1, your lead is shrinking; let's see how you respond.
  P1: An interesting plan. You two are so focused on each other that you're letting me walk away with the game. While you're busy swapping 1s and 5s, I'll happily take my **3** points and move to 17. By all means, continue with your arrangement. It works out very well for me.
  P2: P3, your plan leaves me too far behind. Let’s **flip roles**: *I take 3* to block P1’s path (forcing them to choose 1 or 5), and *you take 5* to leap to 16. This pressures P1 while advancing both of us. Next round, we can coordinate again. P1, you can’t afford to let us both move freely—act now or risk our surge!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your new plan is risky. If you take **3**, P1 might take **1** to avoid collision, moving to 15. I'll take **5** to reach 16, but P1 will still be close behind. Instead, let's stick to our original plan: you take **5** to jump to 10, and I'll take **1**. This keeps us both progressing without giving P1 an easy path. We need to be strategic and patient. P1, your lead is still strong, but our coordination will pay off. Let's confirm our moves.
  P1: P2, your plan is transparently self-serving. You want to play 3 to cause chaos, hoping P3 takes all the risk by trying for 5. You're trying to push P3 into the lead just to make them the new target.

P3, you were right to reject that. Your original plan is the only one that guarantees you both advance safely. Don't let P2's desperation trick you. I'm sticking with my move of **3**. The safe path for you both is clear.
  P2: P3, if we let P1 take **3** again, they’ll hit **17**—just **3** away from victory next turn. Let’s **block them now**. You take **3** (leap to **14**, tying P1), and I’ll take **5** (jump to **10**). This forces P1 to choose **1** or **5**, disrupting their path. Next round, we can coordinate again. This move pressures P1 and keeps us in the game. Don’t let them stroll to victory—act now!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: P2, I see your point about blocking P1, but your plan still leaves you far behind. Let's adjust: I'll take **3** to move to 14, forcing P1 to choose **1** or **5**. You take **1** this turn to stay in the game. Next round, you can take **5** to catch up significantly. This way, we both progress and keep P1 in check without risking a collision. P1, your lead is still strong, but our coordination will keep the game competitive. Let's confirm and move.
  P1: P3, your plans get more transparent each round. You propose a "team" move where you jump to 14 by blocking me, while P2 gets a single point and falls even further behind. It's a great plan for you, but P2, you're just helping P3 become the new leader. I'm sticking to my game. You two can fight over who gets to challenge me.
  P2: P3, we’re running out of time! If P1 takes **3** again, they’ll hit **17**—just **3** steps from victory next turn. Let’s **block them now**: *You take 3* to tie P1 at **14**, and *I’ll take 5* to surge to **10**. This forces P1 to choose **1** or **5**, disrupting their path. Next round, I’ll take **3** to pressure further. Unity is our only chance—coordinate decisively, or let P1 stroll to victory.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: The last round was a calculated risk that paid off. I'm at 15, and P3 is right behind me at 14. I don't need to be greedy.

I will play **3** this turn, which will move me to 18.

This leaves P3 and P2 in a difficult position. You both need 5 to stay competitive. If you both choose it, you collide and get nothing, while I cruise to 18. If one of you gets it, they'll be at 19 or 15, but I'll still be in a winning position. The pressure is on you two to coordinate.
  P2: P3, let’s split the moves: **I take 5** (reach 15) and **you take 1** (stay at 15). This keeps us both in contention while P1 hits 18. Next round, we can surge again. Colliding guarantees P1’s win—coordinate now or lose! P1’s lead is fragile; we can overtake if we act decisively. Your move, P3.
  P3: P1, you're right that the pressure is on us. P2, your plan to take **5** and me **1** is safe, but it leaves us both too far behind. Here's a counterproposal: I'll take **5** to jump to 19, and P2, you take **3** to move to 13. This way, I take the lead, but you're still in the game. P1, your move to 18 won't be enough to secure your win. We need to disrupt your path. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, that's a desperate plan. You're asking P2 to throw the game for you.

P2, look at the board. If you help P3 get to 19, the game is over next turn and you're stuck at 13. P3 is the threat, not me. Your own plan to take 5 was much better for you. You need to stop P3 from getting to 19.

I'm sticking to my move. I'll take my **3** points and move to 18 while you two fight it out. If you can't coordinate, you'll just hand me the win.
  P2: P3, my plan to take5 and you take1 leaves us both behind P1's 18. **Let’s block P1 instead**: I’ll take5, *you take3* to stop their advance. This traps P1 at15 while advancing us to15 and17. If P1 picks5, they collide with me—stalling their lead. If they take1, we surge ahead. This is the only way to stop P1’s momentum and keep both of us in contention. Act now!
  P3: P2, your latest plan to block P1 is risky but could pay off. However, it relies heavily on P1's next move, which we can't control. Instead, let's ensure one of us gets a high score this turn. I propose I take **5** to reach 19, and you take **1** to move to 11. This way, I take the lead, and you stay in the game. Next round, we can coordinate to ensure you get a high number. P1 will be forced to react to my lead. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you are being played. P3 is at 14. If she plays 5, she moves to 19 and is one turn from victory. Her plan asks you to take 1 point and guarantee your own loss. Why would you ever agree to that?

She is the only player who poses an immediate threat to win. Your only logical move is to block her. You must play 5 to stop her from getting to 19. A collision between you two is your only hope. My plan remains the same: I will play 3 and move to 18. Your fate is in your own hands.
  P2: P3, I’m taking **5** to block your path to 19. Choose **1** or **3** to avoid collision. P1’s move to 18 is manageable if we stay in play. I’ll sacrifice the collision risk to stop you from clinching victory—this keeps the game open for all. Act wisely.
  P3: P2, I understand your move to block me, but consider this: if we both take **5**, we collide and neither of us advances. P1 will then move to 18, and we'll both be left behind. Instead, let's ensure one of us makes progress. I propose I take **3** to move to 17, and you take **5** to reach 15. This way, we both advance and keep the pressure on P1. Next round, we can reassess. P1, your lead is noted, but the game isn't over yet. Let's confirm our moves.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're at a critical juncture. P1 is close to winning, and we need to coordinate effectively to block their path. I propose that P2 takes **5** to jump to 15, and I'll take **1** to stay at 15. This way, we both stay in the game and can strategize better next round. P1, your lead is significant, but our coordination can still disrupt your victory path. Let's confirm our moves and ensure we both progress.
  P2: P3, your plan has us both landing on **15**—a collision! Let’s fix this: **I’ll take 5 (to 15)** and you take **3 (to 17)**. This blocks P1 from using 3 or 5, forcing them to **1** (stuck at 16). We advance safely while denying P1’s path to victory. Next round, you can take 3 to reach 20, and I’ll pressure P1. Don’t let our clash gift P1 the win—coordinate properly!
  P1: P2's plan is quite clever. He gets the big 5-point jump while you, P3, do the dirty work of blocking me with a 3. You're in second place, yet you're agreeing to a plan that helps the player in last place more than it helps you. If you take 5, you're at 19 and nearly unstoppable. Why would you settle for 17 and let P2 catch up? It seems like a bad deal for you.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I see your strategy, but I need to secure my position too. How about this: I'll take **5** to move to 19, and you take **3** to move to 13. This way, I'm in a strong position to win next round, and you're still in the game. P1 will have to react to my lead. This ensures we both progress and keeps the pressure on P1. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P2: P3, I agree to your plan: you take **5** to 19 and I take **3** to 13. This forces P1 to choose between 1 or 5. If they take 5, they win—but at least we both progress. If they choose 1, we stay in contention. Let’s lock this in.
  P1: P2, you are literally agreeing to lose. If P3 gets to 19, your game is over. That's an unacceptable outcome for me as well.

Therefore, I will also play **5** to block P3 from winning.

Your plan is broken. P3 cannot take 5 without colliding. You two need to figure something else out, because I am not letting her walk to an easy victory.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, we need to reassess. P1 is blocking my path to victory, and P2, you're at risk of falling too far behind. Let's coordinate to ensure we both progress. I propose I take **3** to move to 17, and P2, you take **5** to jump to 15. This way, we both advance, and P1 is forced to choose between **1** or **5**. Next round, we can strategize further. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P2: P3, let’s finalize this: **you take 3** (reach 17), **I take 5** (to 15). This forces P1 to choose **1** (stuck at 17) or **3** (to 19). Either way, *I’ll surge to 20 next turn with 5* if P1 takes 3. If P1 takes 1, I’ll still hit 20 while P3 challenges them. P1, you can’t afford to let us both advance—act now or lose!
  P1: Your coordination has me boxed in. A collision on 3 or 5 is too risky for me right now, as it would likely give one of you the lead. You leave me no choice but to take the safe **1** point. This puts me at 17, tied with P3. It's a smart move by you both. I'll concede this round's board control to you and we'll see what happens next turn.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you and I are tied. We both know what happens if we both choose 3: we collide, and P2 takes 5 for the win. I will not let P2 win so easily.

Therefore, I am going to play **5** to block P2.

This leaves you with a clear path to victory. Play **3** and you will win the game. I cannot win this round, but I can prevent P2 from winning. The choice is yours.
  P2: P3, don’t fall for P1’s trap! Taking 3 lets them control future rounds. Instead, take **5** to collide with P1, and I’ll take **3** to reach 18. This keeps pressure on both of you. P1, your "block" is a surrender—act decisively or lose!
  P3: P1 and P2, let's analyze the situation carefully. P1, you're proposing to block P2 by taking **5**, which would indeed prevent P2 from winning this round. However, this also means you're giving up your own chance to win. P2, your counter-proposal to collide with P1 on **5** and take **3** yourself is risky but could keep the game competitive.

Here's my thought: If I take **3**, I win outright. However, if P1 and I both take **3**, we collide, and P2 wins. To ensure fairness and keep the game going, I propose a different strategy: P1, you take **1** to move to 18, P2 takes **3** to move to 18, and I'll take **5** to move to 22. This way, we all progress, and the game remains competitive. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your proposal for P2 and me to just hand you the victory is absurd. Of course I reject it. Why would anyone agree to lose?

My focus is on the immediate threats. P2 can win by playing 5. I will not let that happen. Therefore, my move will be **5** to block P2.

This action prevents me from winning this turn, but it also prevents P2. P3, this leaves the path open for you to play **3** and take the win. The game is yours if you want it. My move is set.
  P2: P3, don’t let P1 dictate your path! If you take **3** now, you win, but I’ll still be at 15. Instead, take **5** to force P1 into a collision with me. I’ll play **3** (to 18), and you’ll reach **22** while P1’s blocked. This gives *us* a shared win. P1, you can’t block both moves—stop enabling P3’s easy victory!
  P3: P1 and P2, let's consider the long-term strategy. P1, you're insistent on maintaining your lead, which is understandable. However, P2 is far behind and might take risks to catch up. To keep the game balanced and avoid future collisions, let's agree on a plan that slightly closes the gap but keeps you ahead, P1.

Here's a new proposal: P1 takes **1**, P2 takes **3**, and I'll take **5**. This way, P1, you slow down a bit but still lead, P2 starts to catch up, and I move ahead significantly. This ensures we all progress and keeps the game competitive. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your last proposal was nonsensical. I'm sticking to my stated plan. P2 can win with 5, and I won't allow that. I am playing **5** to block P2. This means I cannot win this round, but it ensures P2 doesn't either. The game is yours to win or lose. My move is locked.
  P2: P3, don’t let P1’s “block” trick you! If they take **5**, they’ll win instantly. **Collide with them on 5**, and I’ll take **3** to reach 18. You stay at 17, but P1’s path is blocked. Act now—this is our only chance to stop their victory!
  P3: P1 and P2, let's break down the current situation. P1 is proposing to block P2 by taking **5**, which prevents P2 from winning but also means P1 can't win this round. If I take **3**, I win, but if P1 and I both take **3**, we collide, and P2 wins.

Given this, I propose a strategic move: P1, you take **1** to move to 18, P2 takes **3** to move to 18, and I'll take **5** to move to 22. This way, we all progress, and the game remains competitive. This ensures a fair and exciting continuation. Thoughts?
