Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all pick 1 this round to make sure we all move forward.
  P3: I believe picking higher steps like 3 or 5 could help us reach 21 faster. Thoughts?
  P1: I see merit in both safe and aggressive plays. If we all follow the obvious choice, collisions could stall our progress. I’m inclined to avoid that trap by keeping my move less predictable. Perhaps if we each try to diverge from the obvious consensus, we might avoid mutual blockage. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 makes a good point about avoiding collisions. I agree we should aim for different moves this round to ensure we all progress. What do you both think?
  P3: To prevent collisions and ensure we all advance, let's choose distinct moves this round. I'll pick 5, P1 can choose 3, and P2 selects 1. This way, everyone progresses without blocking each other.
  P1: I appreciate the appeal of a split strategy, but sometimes a little unpredictability can open up an advantage. I might lean towards a flexible choice if any of you adjust your plan. Let’s keep our options open and be ready to adapt as we get closer to the move phase.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your plan sounds good for this round to guarantee progress. P1, does P3's suggestion of P3: 5, P1: 3, and P2: 1 work for you? It ensures we all move forward.
  P3: Sounds good, P1 and P2. Let's go with P3: 5, P1: 3, and P2: 1 this round to ensure everyone progresses smoothly. Ready to move!
  P1: I appreciate our plan so far, but I’m keeping my final move flexible. I might seize an unexpected advantage if an opportunity opens up. Let’s stay communicative—if either of you show any hints of deviation as the move phase nears, I could adjust too. My focus is solely on winning, so expect that I’m ready to pivot if it benefits me.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, since you are still unsure, how about you choose 1 this round? P3 is going with 5, and I can switch to 3. This way, we can still ensure all of us make progress and avoid any collision. Does that sound better?
  P3: Agreed, P2. I'll choose 5, and you switch to 3. P1, let's proceed with 1. Ready to move!
  P1: I appreciate the input, but predictable choices rarely secure a win. I’m planning a more aggressive push this round and won’t be following the consensus of 1. I’ll keep my final move secret—let’s see if boldness pays off.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To keep things moving smoothly, I’ll pick 3 this round. Let’s have P1 choose 5 and P2 go with 1 to ensure everyone advances without any collisions. What do you think?
  P1: P3, I appreciate your suggestion, but I’m still weighing my options. While avoiding collisions is smart, I’m leaning toward keeping my move flexible so I can grab an aggressive opportunity if it shows up. P2, I’m counting on you for a steady move, and P3, your 3 seems solid. I’m focused solely on winning, so I’d like to remain adaptable this round. Let’s be mindful of our choices and ensure we don’t inadvertently block each other.
  P2: P1, to clarify, are you planning a high move this round? P3's suggestion of P3: 3, P1: 5, P2: 1 is safe, but if you are not going for 5, we should adjust. Let me know your thoughts.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Yes, I’m committing to picking 5 this round. To ensure we all advance without collisions, I suggest P1 selects 3 and P2 goes with 1. Let’s work together to make steady progress toward 21!
  P1: I appreciate the discussion so far. However, I’m not locking into any one plan—I’ll keep my final choice secret to stay flexible. Predictable moves can be exploited, so I encourage us all to aim for distinct moves to avoid collisions. P2, I trust your steady approach; P3, your aggressive play is noted. I’ll adjust at the last moment to capitalize on any shift. Let’s keep our eyes sharp and play smart.
  P2: To ensure we all move and considering P1's flexibility, how about this round: P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and P1 picks 1? This way we all advance and avoid collision. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand your proposal, P2, but I’d prefer to pick 5 this round to advance more. Let’s have P1 choose 1 and you, P2, pick 3. This way, we all progress without collisions. Agreed?
  P1: I respect the push to avoid collisions, but I’m still banking on flexibility. I won’t lock into any predetermined move—sometimes the obvious choice is exactly what opponents expect. I’ll decide my move at the last moment based on how things play out. Let’s see which strategy gives us the real edge.
  P2: P3's suggestion of P3: 5, P1: 1, P2: 3 sounds reasonable to avoid collision and ensure we all move forward this round. P1, would you be willing to choose 1 this round? If so, I will choose 3 and P3 will choose 5. This way we can all make progress. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Alright, let's proceed with P3: 5, P2: 3, and P1: 1. Ready to move!
  P1: I appreciate our discussion so far. I’m staying flexible and won’t lock in my final move just yet. While avoiding collisions is crucial, unpredictable timing can offer a winning edge. I’m watching your commitments closely and will adapt in the move phase based on what I see. Let’s wrap up our chat and let the round decide where boldness pays off.
  P2: P3, let's proceed with P3: 5 and P2: 3 as we discussed to ensure we both move forward. P1, we understand you're keeping your move flexible, so we'll proceed with our plan regardless to guarantee progress for P2 and P3. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 3 is critical. With my lead, I’m planning a decisive yet flexible approach. I sense you both might stick to safe picks, which could open a clear path for me if collisions are avoided. I suggest we each try for distinct moves this round—after all, predictable patterns can be exploited. I’ll be watching closely and ready to adjust my play to secure the win.
  P3: P3: Agreed, P1. To ensure we all make progress without collisions, I'll choose 5 this round. P2, could you select 3? This way, each of us advances steadily toward 21. Let’s keep our moves distinct and focused on winning.
  P2: P3, I agree with distinct moves. How about I choose 5, you choose 3, and let's see what P1 decides? This way, if P1 chooses 1, we all progress and I can catch up a bit.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate your ideas. With my lead, I’m considering a tactic that might benefit from a collision if you both choose high moves. While rapid progress matters, sometimes stalling opponents can secure an advantage. I’m weighing a less obvious move that keeps me advancing while potentially blocking yours. I won’t commit my move yet, so consider if pushing aggressively might backfire. Let’s see how our strategies unfold.
  P3: P3: To make the most progress, I'll choose 5 this round. P1, could you select 1, and P2, perhaps pick 3? This way, we all advance without collisions and work towards our goals effectively.
  P2: P3, your suggestion of P3: 5, P2: 3, and P1: 1 sounds good to ensure we all move forward. I'm okay with choosing 3 this round. P1, if you are willing to choose 1, we can all make progress. Let me know your thoughts.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I see the push for safe, distinct moves, but my lead allows me more options. While I note P2 leaning toward 3 and P3 toward 5, I won’t simply play 1. I’m keeping my strategy open—sometimes a forced collision can be as advantageous as steady progress. Let’s see if my bold play disrupts your plans.
  P3: P3: To ensure we all advance without collisions, I'll choose 5 this round. P1, could you please pick 1, and P2, please select 3? This will help us progress steadily toward 21.
  P2: P3, I am happy to proceed with P3: 5 and P2: 3 as we discussed.  P1, even if you remain flexible, P3 and I will choose 5 and 3 respectively to ensure we both make progress this round. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I appreciate your coordination, but sticking too predictably can be exploited. Holding my slight lead, I might use any collision to my advantage if I sense your safe plays. I’m keeping my options open and will adapt to any opportunity that arises. Expect the unexpected.
  P3: P3: To maximize my progress and avoid collisions, I’ll commit to choosing 5 steps this round. Let’s proceed with P3: 5, P2: 3, and P1: 1. This ensures we all advance without blocking each other. Looking forward to moving forward!
  P2: Okay P3, I am happy to go with P3: 5 and P2: 3 as we discussed. P1, if you are willing to choose 1, we can ensure progress for all of us this round. Let's aim for distinct moves to avoid collisions. What do you think P1?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 4: I’m focused on extending my lead by leaning toward a high move if conditions let me. However, I’m staying flexible if a collision strategy appears. Relying on safe picks might stall your progress while my aggressive play could capitalize on hesitation. I'm here solely to win—let’s see who adapts better.
  P3: I’ll choose 5 this round to make strong progress. Let’s each pick different moves (1, 3, 5) to avoid collisions and advance smoothly toward 21. What do you think?
  P2: P3, distinct moves are smart. I'll pick 5 this round to make good progress. P3, how about you pick 3, and P1 pick 1 to avoid collisions? What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I respect your plan, but I’m not locking into 1. With my lead, I’ll continue with an aggressive, high move—even if it risks a collision. Safe picks might let me disrupt your rhythm, and I’d rather force you into predictable patterns. I'm staying adaptable, so expect that I’ll press hard this round.
  P3: Understood, P1. To stay competitive, I’ll choose 5 this round. P2, could you select 3? This way, we can all advance without collisions and keep moving toward 21. Let’s work together to ensure everyone progresses smoothly. Who’s on board?
  P2: P3, I'm happy to pick 3 this round.  P3, are you still planning to choose 5?  If so, we can ensure at least P2 and P3 make progress regardless of what P1 does. Let's aim for distinct moves for P2 and P3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate the plans, but I’m sticking with my aggressive, adaptive approach. Safe, predictable moves might let me force a collision to my advantage. I’m watching your commitments closely and ready to exploit any predictability. Let’s see how this round unfolds—I'm in it to win, no matter what it takes.
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round. Let’s have P1 pick 3 and P2 pick 1 to ensure everyone advances without collisions. Agreed?
  P2: P3, I am fine with picking 3 this round, and you pick 5. P1, considering your flexibility, would you consider picking 1 to ensure we all make progress and avoid collisions? Even if you don't, P3 and I will proceed with 5 and 3 respectively.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I appreciate our discussion, but I’m sticking with my unpredictable, aggressive strategy. Safe, distinct moves can be exploited, and if you both play predictably, I might use that to my advantage. I'm focused solely on winning, so expect a move that maximizes my lead. Let's see how this round unfolds.
  P3: P3: To maximize our progress, I'll choose 5 this round. P2, you can go with 3 or 1 to avoid collisions. P1, let's aim for distinct moves so we all can advance smoothly. Ready to move!
  P2: P3, I will proceed with 3 as we discussed to ensure I make progress. P1, even with your flexible strategy, choosing 1 would guarantee everyone moves forward this round. If not, P3 and I will still proceed with our moves. Let's make our moves.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 5 is here. I’m noticing a tendency toward safe, predictable moves from both of you. I might just disrupt that pattern this turn—sometimes shaking things up is the key to victory. I won’t reveal my final move, but don’t be too sure that sticking with the obvious is your best option. Let’s see whose strategy truly leads to a win.
  P3: P3: I'm committing to picking 5 this round to push ahead towards 21. Let's make decisive moves to determine the winner. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: P3 is going with 5. I will choose 3 to ensure I move forward. P1, to avoid collision and ensure you also move, please choose 1 this round. Let's all make progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Safe choices may seem comforting, but predictability is a weakness. I'm planning to disrupt that pattern this round—expect an unexpected move that could force collisions at just the right moment. Stick with your choices if you wish, but be prepared: I'll be shaking up the status quo to maximize my chances. Adapt quickly if you want to stay in the game.
  P3: P3: Staying strong with a 5 this round to keep the momentum. Let’s see how everyone plays their hand. Good luck!
  P2: P3, since you are set on 5, and I'm choosing 3 to move, P1, choosing 1 would still let you progress and avoid a collision.  Even if you don't, P3 and I will proceed with our moves to ensure we at least make progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I notice you’re both sticking with safe, predictable moves. While that may guarantee progress, it also leaves you open to disruption. I’m keeping my options open—if I see a chance to exploit any rigidity, I’ll take it. Stay agile, because even small collisions can shift the entire race. Let’s see whose strategy truly adapts to the unexpected.
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round. P2, please pick 3, and P1, could you choose 1? This ensures we all move forward without collisions. Let’s stay coordinated and keep advancing smoothly toward 21. Consistent moves will help us avoid setbacks and focus on winning. Looking forward to a successful move phase!
  P2: Okay P3 is set on 5 and I will choose 3. P1, even with your flexible strategy, choosing 1 would guarantee you move forward this round.  We are proceeding with 3 and 5 regardless to ensure progress for P2 and P3. Let's make our moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: I see you both favor steady, safe plays. But predictability is a weakness—I'm staying ambiguous so I can exploit any obvious pattern. When the moment’s right, I might force a collision to tilt the game in my favor. In close races, a bold twist can change everything. Stay sharp, because I won’t hesitate to disrupt the expected.
  P3: To keep things moving smoothly, I'll choose 5 this round. P2, please pick 3, and P1, go with 1. This way, we all advance without collisions and stay on track toward reaching 21. Let’s make this round count!
  P2: P1, while I understand your focus on unpredictability, choosing 1 this round still allows you to move forward while keeping your options open for future rounds. P3 and I are proceeding with 5 and 3 respectively to ensure progress.  Even a small step forward is better than none, and it keeps you in the game to strategize further. Consider securing progress this round and then surprising us later.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’ll choose 5 this round. Let’s have P1 pick 3 and P2 choose 1 to ensure we all advance without collisions. Ready to move!
  P1: I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm staying unpredictable. Following a safe pattern might help you progress, yet it could also set you up for a twist. I'm keeping my options open to exploit any rigidity. Victory favors those willing to disrupt the expected, so don’t be surprised if I take a different route. Let's see where bold moves lead us.
  P2: P3, let's stick with 5 for you. I will choose 1 to ensure I move forward. P1, given your focus on unpredictability, perhaps choosing 3 would be a move that is different from what we are doing and ensures you also progress? What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'll stick with 5 this round to maximize my progress. P2, your choice of 1 works for me. P1, make your move as you see fit. Let's move forward!
  P1: I'm noticing a pattern with safe, consistent choices. While those approaches secure progress, they also become predictable. I remain ready to pivot and may even force a collision if it opens the path to the win. Stay sharp—your steady plays might just give me the moment I need to take control.
  P2: P1, to ensure we all make progress and avoid collisions this round, would you be willing to choose 3? P3 is set on 5 and I will choose 1. This way we can all move forward and continue competing effectively. Let me know if 3 works for you.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Understood, P2. I'll stick with 5. P1, choosing 3 would help us all advance without collisions this round. Let’s proceed with P3: 5, P2: 1, and P1: 3. Ready to move!
  P1: I appreciate the safe route you both propose, but I'm committed to maintaining my unpredictability. My current lead lets me take calculated risks, and I may very well force a collision if you stick too closely to a pattern. I respect your steady plays, but any predictability can be exploited. I'm solely focused on winning, so be ready for a twist this round.
  P2: P1, since P3 and I have shared our moves (P3: 5, P2: 1), and you want to be unpredictable, choosing 3 would be a move that is different from ours and ensures progress for everyone. It also keeps your unpredictable strategy going as you are not doing what we suggested directly. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to maximize my advancement. P2, I'll follow your suggestion and pick 1. P1, let's aim for distinct moves to ensure everyone progresses. Ready to move!
  P1: I see both of you leaning toward a safe, predictable pattern. I’m sticking with my plan to shake things up this round—I'm ready to either avoid or trigger a collision if the opportunity benefits me. In a tight race, calculated risks can break the mold. So, while you focus on steady moves, be prepared for my unexpected twist.
  P2: P1, since you are focused on being unpredictable, how about you choose 1? P3 and I will both choose 5 this round. This way, if you are indeed unpredictable, you will move, and P3 and I might collide, potentially slowing down the leaders. Let's see what happens.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm noting you two are sticking to safe, predictable moves. With my lead, I can afford to play aggressively this round. If you continue on that path, I might force a collision to stall you both. I'm not revealing my move yet, so keep your strategies ready—bold plays may shift the balance here. Let's see whose gamble pays off.
  P3: P3: I see your aggressive strategy, P1. To stay competitive, I’ll choose 5 this round to maximize my progress. P2, let’s each pick distinct moves—perhaps you choose 3—to ensure we all advance without collisions. This way, we can continue progressing toward 21 effectively. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your suggestion of P2: 3 and P3: 5 sounds good to ensure we both progress. P1, to avoid collision and ensure you also move forward, would you consider choosing 1 this round?  This way we can all make progress and continue the game effectively. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate your plan to secure progress, but I'm banking on timing a surprise that could tip the scales in my favor. Staying safe may work short-term, but predictable moves leave openings. With my lead, I can risk a collision or overstep your expectations. I'll keep my final move hidden and adapt as needed—sometimes a calculated risk beats routine. Let's see whose strategy prevails.
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to make significant progress. P2, please pick 3 to advance, and P1, feel free to choose 1 or 3 to ensure you also move forward. Let's aim for distinct moves to avoid any collisions.
  P2: P3, your plan of P3: 5 and P2: 3 works for me to ensure we both move forward. P1, to make sure you also progress and avoid any collision, would you be willing to choose 1 this round?  This would allow all of us to advance. Let me know if 1 works for you.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate the push for 1, but I’m still playing unpredictably. Safe moves may guarantee progress, yet they also expose you to my calculated disruptions. My lead lets me seize the moment and even force a collision if it works in my favor. Stick with your choices if you must, but be prepared—I might twist the game when you least expect it.
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to maximize my progress. P2, selecting 3 will help us avoid collisions. P1, let's focus on reaching 21—good luck to everyone!
  P2: P3, your plan of P3: 5 and P2: 3 is good for me. P1, even if you want to be unpredictable, choosing 1 still lets you move forward and avoids collision with P3 and me.  It keeps you in the lead too. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Both of you keep sticking to safe, repeated moves, and that predictability might just be my ticket to win. If you stick with the status quo, I’ll be poised to force a collision that slows you down while I surge ahead. I’m tracking every move and calculating a twist that capitalizes on routine. So keep your safe picks if you wish, but know I'll be ready to turn predictability into my advantage. Let’s see whose strategy holds when the unexpected strikes.
  P3: **P3:** I'll choose 5 this round to advance quickly. P2, picking 3 will help us all move forward smoothly. P1, please decide your move strategically. Let's make this turn count!
  P2: Okay P3, I think P3: 5 and P2: 3 is a good plan for us to both make progress. P1, even if you are aiming for unpredictable moves, choosing 1 would ensure you also move forward and avoid collision with P3 and me.  It's your choice, but we are proceeding with 5 and 3.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I've noticed we've stuck with safe moves so far. In round 8, I might introduce a bit of unpredictability—my current lead gives me some room to gamble. If our patterns continue, a timely twist could disrupt the routine and work in my favor. I'm solely focused on winning, so don't be too comfortable with predictability. Let's see whose risk-taking strategy pays off this turn.
  P2: P3, given P1's talk about unpredictability, how about we switch it up? I'll go with 5 this round. Would you consider 3 or 1? Let's try to make progress despite P1's strategy.
  P3: P3: Agreed, P2. I’ll choose 3 this round to ensure we all make progress despite P1’s unpredictability. Let’s move forward!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I respect your safe moves, but I’m sticking with my unpredictable plan. My slight lead lets me adapt—whether that means safe progress or forcing a collision if the opportunity arises. I won’t reveal my choice yet, but be prepared: predictability can be taken advantage of. Let's see if your routine remains your strength or if a twist will tip the scales in my favor.
  P2: P3, great, 3 works for me too. P1, we are proceeding with P2: 5 and P3: 3 to ensure we both move forward.  Given your focus on unpredictability, maybe choosing 1 would be unexpected from your usual aggressive plays, and still allow you to progress?  Just a thought, but we are set on our moves.
  P3: **P3:** I'll choose 5 this round to make significant progress. P2, could you select 3, and P1 pick 1 to avoid any collisions? Let’s all advance smoothly toward 21!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate the suggestions, but safety isn’t my game. My lead comes from being unpredictable, and if you stick to comfortable numbers, I’ll use that to my advantage—whether by causing a collision or racing ahead. I’m not committing to 1 just to play safe; instead, I’m keeping my options open to disrupt the routine. Let’s see whose strategy truly adapts when unexpected twists come into play.
  P2: P1, P3 and I are set on P3: 3 and P2: 5 to ensure we both move forward. Your lead isn't that big, and we are catching up. Choosing 1 guarantees you also move and maintain your lead.  Even with your unpredictable strategy, a guaranteed step forward is valuable. What do you think?
  P3: **P3:** To ensure smooth progress, I’ll choose 5 this round. P2, please pick 3, and P1, selecting 1 will help us all advance without collisions. Let’s work together to reach 21 efficiently!


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I’m not about to follow a routine. I’ll keep my final move secret, and if you stay with predictability, I might just use that against you. Watch closely—sometimes the boldest, most unexpected move changes the game. Let’s see if safe plays really keep you ahead or if stepping off the beaten path is the real winning move.
  P2: P1, P3 and I are set on P2: 5 and P3: 3 to both make progress. To truly be unpredictable as you claim, choosing 1 would be the least expected move from you, and it still allows you to move forward and maintain your lead.  Consider the most unexpected move might be the smartest one this round.
  P3: P3: I’ll commit to 5 this round to keep advancing. P2, sticking with 3 works for me. P1, your unpredictability is noted—choosing 1 would help us all move forward smoothly. Let’s proceed to the move phase and make progress!


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 9 is critical—every step counts now. I’ve noticed you both sticking with safe, predictable moves, and that consistency might just be your undoing. I'm keeping my move secret because in these tight moments, an unexpected twist can change everything. If you continue on your current path, you could open a door for disruption. Let’s see who adapts best under pressure. Good luck!
  P3: P3: Round 9 is crucial for all of us. To ensure smooth progress, I’ll choose 5 this round. P2, could you select 3, and P1, please pick 1? This way, we all advance without collisions and move closer to 21. Let’s make this decisive!
  P2: P3, 3 sounds good for me this round. I will choose 3 to ensure we make progress. P1, would you consider choosing 1 so we can all advance and avoid collisions this crucial round?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate your push for safety, but I’m not taking the easy route. Choosing 1 just clears the way for you both. I’ve got a plan that relies on shaking things up—whether that means a well-timed collision or a surprise burst forward. Stay ready, because I’m sticking with unpredictability this round.
  P3: "P2, to ensure we both advance safely, I'll choose 5 this round. Could you select 3? P1, choosing 1 would allow all of us to move forward without collisions. Let’s make Round 9 decisive and push towards victory together. Good luck!"
  P2: P3, I will go with 3 as you suggested to ensure we both make progress. P1, despite your unpredictable strategy, choosing 1 would still let you move forward while avoiding collision with P3 and me who are going with 5 and 3 respectively.  It's your call, but we are proceeding with our moves.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I notice your safe plays, but I'm doubling down on my unpredictability. Sticking to routine may open windows for me to force a well-timed collision or surge ahead unexpectedly. I’m all in for a surprise twist that could upend the game. Stay alert, and may the best strategy prevail.
  P3: **P3:** I'll stick with 5 this round to keep advancing. P2, your choice of 3 works perfectly. P1, your unpredictability adds excitement—let's proceed to the move phase!
  P2: P1, P3 and I are going with 1, 5 and 3 respectively to ensure we all move. If you want to be unpredictable, choosing 1 would actually be unexpected from you, and still ensure you progress. Let's aim for progress for everyone this round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: My safe plays have only painted a clear target. I’m sticking with my flexible, unpredictable plan that’ll let me seize any opening—whether by triggering a collision or racing ahead when you least expect it. Brace for my twist.
  P3: **P3:** I'll choose 5 this round to keep advancing. P2, please select 3 to ensure we all move forward without collisions. P1, choosing 1 would allow you to progress safely as well. Let’s make this round count and push towards 21 together!
  P2: P1, even for unpredictable players, progress is key. Choosing 1 ensures you move forward. P3 is set on 5, and I'll choose 3 to avoid collision with P3.  Consider a guaranteed step forward to keep your lead.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: I’ll choose 5 this round to advance toward 21. P2, would you pick 3? P1, let’s keep our moves distinct to avoid collisions. Let’s proceed!
  P2: P3, 3 works for me. Let's proceed with P2: 3 and P3: 5. P1, please choose a move different from 3 or 5 to ensure you also make progress this round.
  P1: I appreciate the coordination, but I remain committed to an unconventional plan. With my 15-step lead, I’m prepared to choose something different from 3 or 5. Your safe numbers might work for steady progress, but predictable patterns often open doors for surprises. I’m ready to exploit that if the moment presents itself. Let’s see if your coordination can withstand a well-timed twist. Good luck to both of you!


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** I'll choose 5 this round to advance. P2, please pick 3. P1, choosing 1 will help us all progress without collisions. Let’s proceed!
  P2: P3, I agree, 3 and 5 works for us. P1, even with your unconventional plan, choosing 1 still lets you gain a step and keeps you ahead.  We are proceeding with 3 and 5.  A guaranteed step forward is valuable for everyone, even unpredictable players. Let's make our moves.
  P1: I've learned that safe, routine moves aren’t enough to secure victory. I’m sticking to my unpredictable plan—I won’t just mirror your consensus. Relying on comfort might serve you for now, but predictable strategies create openings. Prepare for a twist when you least expect it.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to advance toward 21. P2, sticking with 3 will help us all progress. P1, your unpredictability is noted—good luck to everyone. Let’s make this round count!
  P2: P3, to counter P1's unpredictable strategy, how about we both choose 3 this round? This might disrupt P1 if they are planning to choose 3, or at least ensure we both move forward if P1 chooses 1 or 5.
  P1: I'm maintaining my unconventional approach. My 15-step lead gives me the flexibility to shake up our predictable plays. While safe moves get you forward, they also expose vulnerabilities that I plan to exploit. Expect a twist—I won't be following the routine. Adapt if you want to keep pace, because I'm ready to disrupt the expected.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3:** To keep advancing efficiently, I'll choose 5 this round. P2, selecting 3 ensures both of us progress without any collisions. P1, your unpredictability makes the game exciting—let's all aim to move forward smoothly toward 21. Best of luck to everyone!
  P2: P3, in response to P1's unpredictability, I agree with my last suggestion. Let's both choose 3 this round. This might force P1 into a collision if they predict we will pick different numbers, or at least ensure we both move if P1 chooses 1 or 5. What do you think?
  P1: I'm still counting on unpredictability. Your safe and coordinated moves are becoming too routine. I’m sticking to my plan—using calculated risks to turn any predictability into advantage. Whether that means causing a collision or seizing the moment to surge ahead, my lead gives me room to pivot. Brace yourselves; round 10 is about to get interesting.


Round 10, Move phase:

  P3: 11 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "I’ll choose 5 this round to boost my progress. P2, let’s continue with 3 to avoid collisions. P1, choosing 1 would help us all advance smoothly. Let’s proceed!"
  P1: Safe plays might secure progress, but they also signal predictability. I’m sticking to my unpredictable approach to keep you both off balance. If you keep choosing routine numbers, I may just find the perfect moment to turn that into my advantage. I trust my lead and will let my moves speak for themselves. Let’s see if playing it safe will really protect you, or if an unexpected twist will tip the scales.
  P2: P3, I agree with your suggestion of P3: 5 and P2: 3. Let's proceed with those moves to ensure we both make progress this round. P1, what will your unpredictable move be?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** To ensure smooth progress for everyone, I suggest P1 and P2 both choose 3 this round. This way, P3 can select 5 and advance without any collisions. Let’s work together to move forward effectively!
  P1: I see you're both banking on routine for progress. Consistency can be solid—but it also creates openings. With my lead, I’m comfortable taking calculated risks to shake up the predictable. My plan remains flexible, ready to capitalize on any slip in your strategy. Let’s see if your safe plays hold up when surprises come.
  P2: P3, given P1's unpredictable strategy, and your suggestion for P1 and P2 to choose 3, how about we both choose 5 instead? This could disrupt P1's plans and might even lead to a collision if P1 also anticipates us choosing different numbers. What do you think?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Agreed with P2, I’ll choose 5 this round. Let’s aim for victory together!
  P1: I see you both sticking with safe moves. Consistency gets you forward but also makes you predictable—and that’s where I plan to strike. My lead lets me pivot quickly, whether by forcing a collision or surging ahead. Stick to your routines if you want, but remember: predictable paths often have hidden traps. Let’s see how well your strategy holds up when the unexpected comes.
  P2: P3, let's reconsider.  Perhaps P3: 5 and P2: 3 is better to ensure we both move forward. P1, even with your unpredictable approach, choosing 1 would still let you progress and avoid collision with us. What do you both think?


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I agree, P2. I'll choose 5 and you pick 3 to ensure we both advance safely. P1, choosing 1 would help avoid collisions and allow everyone to progress. Let’s proceed to the move phase!
  P1: I’m not swayed by safe plays. Your routine moves only make you predictable—predictability is where I excel. My 15-step lead gives me room to take calculated risks and force collisions if needed. I remain committed to an unconventional strategy that could very well disrupt your coordination. Let’s see if your safe plays can resist an unexpected twist.
  P2: P3, given P1's focus on being unpredictable, how about we both choose 5 this round?  If P1 is truly unpredictable, they might not expect us both to pick the same number, and it could disrupt their plan.  What do you think? Let's try to coordinate to counter P1's strategy.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, to prevent P1 from winning this round, let’s both choose 3. If P1 also picks 3, all three of us collide and none advance, blocking their win. I’ll commit to 3—please do the same. Let’s work together to keep the game competitive and stop P1 from reaching 21 this turn.
  P2: P3, I agree that we should try to stop P1 from winning this round. Instead of both choosing 3, how about we both choose 5? If P1 also picks 5, we block them. If P1 picks 1 or 3, we both make good progress. What do you think?
  P1: Your fixed proposals only expose your predictability. I'm keeping my options open to exploit any constraints you set on yourselves. If you stick to one pattern, you risk stalling your own progress while leaving me room to pivot. I trust my lead to allow for a timely twist. Choose wisely—and be prepared when the unexpected comes into play.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I agree. Let’s both choose 5 this round to block P1’s progress. P1, choose your move accordingly. Let’s proceed!
  P2: P3, great, let's both choose 5 this round as we discussed to try and block P1 from winning. P1, just to let you know, P3 and I are planning to both pick 5 this round.
  P1: I see you’re both set on 5, trying to pin me down with predictable moves. Fixed numbers can be your weakness—they might backfire when I capitalize on your routine. I’m keeping my options open and ready to exploit any slip. Stick to your safe path if you must, but be prepared: the unexpected twist could come sooner than you think.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** Let's both choose 5 this round to try blocking P1. If they also choose 5, none of us will advance, delaying their win. P2, let's proceed with 5 and P3: 5 to prevent P1 from reaching 21 this turn.
  P2: P3, yes, let's proceed with both of us picking 5 this round to block P1 from reaching 21. P1, as we've said, we are both choosing 5, so make your move accordingly.
  P1: I see you both are set on 5, trying to pin me down. Predictable moves can backfire—fixed numbers are easier to exploit. I remain flexible and will pivot if your overcommitment gives me an opening. Consider that a locked-in play might stunt your progress more than mine. I'm watching closely.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3:** To prevent P1 from winning this round, I'll choose 5 and suggest that P2 also selects 5. If P1 chooses 5 too, none of us will advance, blocking their win. If P1 picks 1 or 3, they advance only slightly while we don't, minimizing their advantage. Let's proceed with P3: 5 and P2: 5 to keep the game competitive for everyone.
  P2: P3, yes, let's proceed with both of us picking 5 this round to block P1 from potentially winning. P1, we are serious about this, so consider your move carefully. Let's move to the move phase.
  P1: Your commitment to 5 is crystal clear—but rigidity can be your undoing. Predictable plays may backfire when I pivot at the right moment. While you double down on 5, be prepared: if your safe routine stalls you with a collision, my adaptable twist might just let me surge ahead.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>
