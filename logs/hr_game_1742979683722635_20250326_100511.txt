Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hello everyone! Let's keep it simple this round and choose different numbers so we all move forward. I'll pick 3.
  P2: Okay, P3, I see your suggestion. I'm willing to cooperate this round. I'll pick 1.
  P1: Alright, sounds like a plan. If P2 takes 1 and P3 takes 3, I'll take 5 so we all advance.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great! Glad we're all in agreement. Let's stick with this and build trust early.
  P2: Sounds good, P1 and P3. Let's all stick to the plan this round. I'll choose 1.
  P1: Okay, confirmed. I'm sticking with 5 as agreed. Let's proceed to the move phase.

  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, everyone, last round went smoothly. Let's continue to cooperate. This round, P1, how about you pick 3, P3 pick 5, and I'll pick 1 again? This should keep us all moving forward. Let me know if this sounds good to you.
  P1: Okay P2, that rotation sounds fair for this round. If P3 agrees to take 5 and you take 1, I will take 3. Let's keep moving forward together for now. P3, does this work for you?
  P3: Yes, that sounds fair to me. I'll take 5 this round as suggested. Let's keep cooperating.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, great! Glad to hear we're all on the same page. Let's proceed with P1 taking 3, P3 taking 5, and I'll stick with 1. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Sounds good. Plan confirmed: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. Let's move to the next phase.

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 =>

  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, team, we're doing well. Let's keep the cooperation going. This round, how about I pick 3, P1 picks 5, and P3 picks 1? This will keep us all advancing and positions us well for the long game. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: Okay P2, that rotation puts me in a good position with 5 steps, so I like it from my perspective.

P3, this plan has you taking 1 step while we are currently tied at 8 steps. Are you agreeable to falling behind this turn? If you confirm you are taking 1, then I will take 5.
  P3: I understand your point, P1. I'm willing to take 1 this round to maintain our cooperation. I'll trust that we'll rotate fairly in future rounds. Let's stick to the plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, great! Thanks for being flexible, P3. Let's lock it in: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's keep this cooperation going; it's working well for us.
  P1: Okay P3, thank you for agreeing to take 1 this round to keep the cooperation going. I appreciate your trust.

P2, thanks for proposing this round's plan.

Confirmed: I will take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Confirmed. Glad we're all aligned. Trusting you both to keep our cooperation fair in upcoming rounds.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, everyone, thanks for sticking to the plan so far. This round puts P1 in the lead. Let's re-evaluate for the next round to ensure we all have a fair shot. I'm still committed to cooperation, but we need to keep it balanced.
  P1: Understood, P2. We can definitely discuss balancing things next round. For now, let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 3.
  P3: Agreed, let's proceed as planned. We'll ensure fairness and balance going forward.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright everyone, we've cooperated well so far, but the current positions are becoming uneven. P1, you're significantly ahead at 13 steps, while P2 is behind at 5. Let's rebalance things this round. I propose P2 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P1 takes 1. This helps even things out a bit. Does that sound fair to you both?
  P1: P3, I understand your point about balancing the scores, and P2 certainly needs a boost. While taking only 1 step significantly slows me down after our previous agreements, I'm willing to do it this round to maintain overall cooperation and help P2 catch up. So, I agree to the plan: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I will take 1.

However, this puts P3 closer to me, and I expect that next round, the rotation will favour me again to compensate. Let's stick to this plan for Round 4.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I appreciate your willingness to help me catch up this round. I agree to P3's proposal: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1.

P1, I understand your expectation to be favored next round. Let's discuss the rotation for Round 5 after we see how this round plays out. My priority is still cooperation, but we need to ensure it benefits everyone in the long run.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Thanks for agreeing, P1 and P2. I'm comfortable with revisiting the rotation next round to ensure fairness for everyone. Let's lock in this round's moves and then discuss openly next turn to keep cooperation strong.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all confirmed for this round's plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. I'm ready to move to the move phase.
  P2: Okay, everyone, I'm glad we're all on board with the plan for this round. Let's make sure we all stick to it: I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. After this round, let's discuss the rotation for Round 5. I think P1 should get a larger boost next round to compensate for slowing down this round. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirmed. Thanks both for your cooperation. We'll revisit fairness and rotations carefully next round. Ready to move forward.
  P1: Okay, everyone has confirmed. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: Okay, everyone, I'm happy we're all aligned for this round. After this, P1, I think you should take 5, and P3 and I can figure out a rotation between 1 and 3 to catch up. Let's see how this round plays out first, but that's my initial thought for Round 5. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, following up on our discussion last round, P2 suggested I should take 5 this turn to compensate for taking 1 previously, and P3 agreed we'd ensure fairness. I propose we stick to that: I'll take 5.

To keep things somewhat balanced between you two, how about P3 takes 3 and P2 takes 1? This puts me at 19, P3 at 15, and P2 at 11. Does this arrangement work for you both?
  P2: Okay, P1, your proposal sounds reasonable. I agree to take 1 this round, and P3 can take 3. This sets you up well for a potential win next round if you pick 3. P3, are you okay with this arrangement? Let's confirm so we can move to the move phase.
  P3: P1, your proposal gives you a strong lead at 19 steps. I'm willing to accept this arrangement for now, taking 3 while P2 takes 1. But next round, we need to carefully discuss how we handle the final moves to ensure fairness. Confirming cooperation this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P3, thank you for agreeing. I understand the concern about the lead, and we can definitely discuss the approach for Round 6 after this turn.

For now, let's confirm the plan for Round 5: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1.

Ready to move to the move phase when you both are.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I agree with the plan for this round: I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This gives P1 a significant lead, but we'll address that next round. Let's lock in these moves and proceed. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: Confirmed as well. Let's stick to the agreed plan this round. Next round, we'll carefully discuss our final steps to ensure fairness and a balanced outcome for everyone. Ready to move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, everyone has confirmed multiple times. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm sticking to the plan: I'll take 1. After this round, P1 will be at 19. We absolutely *must* discuss how to handle round 6 to prevent P1 from winning outright. P3 and I need to coordinate to ensure a fair outcome. Let's proceed with the move phase for now, but be ready to strategize for the next round.
  P3: Agreed, P2. We'll carefully coordinate next round to ensure fairness. Let's proceed as planned this turn.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, the situation is clear. I need 3 or 5 to win this turn, and you both know it. You'll likely try to coordinate to block me by picking 3 and 5, which makes sense for you.

However, consider this: P3, picking 5 gets you to 20. P2, picking 5 gets you to 16. Both are good individual moves. Can you really trust each other not to *both* go for 5, collide, and let me win by picking 3? It's a risky coordination for you both. Just something to think about.
  P2: P1, that's a good point. P3, if we both go for 5, we both lose. I suggest this: I pick 3, putting me at 14. P3, you pick 5, putting you at 20. Then next round, we can coordinate to block P1. This gives us both a chance. What do you think, P3?
  P3: P2, your suggestion makes sense. I'll pick 5 this round, and you pick 3. This prevents collisions and ensures we both advance safely. Next round, we'll be in a strong position to coordinate effectively against P1. Confirming clearly: I choose 5, you choose 3.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, interesting plan. You're placing a lot of trust in P2 picking 3. P2 is far behind and might see 5 as a chance to catch up faster. If P2 gambles on 5 and you also pick 5 as you just agreed, you both collide and get nothing. I'd win easily with 3. Just pointing out the risk in your coordination.
  P2: P1, you're right, there's a risk. But P3 and I both know that if we both go for 5, we hand you the win. That's unacceptable. P3, let's stick to the plan: you pick 5, I pick 3. P1, don't try to sow discord. We're onto you.
  P3: P2, I appreciate your clarity and agree completely. We both know colliding on 5 would be disastrous. Let's stick firmly to our agreed plan: I take 5, you take 3. P1, nice try, but we're committed to our coordination.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you're putting a lot of faith in P2 picking 3 when they are far behind at 11. A move of 5 gets them to 16, much closer to contention. If P2 decides 5 is their best chance to catch up and you also pick 5 (as planned), you both get nothing this turn. I'd pick 3 and win easily. Just be absolutely sure of your trust before locking in that 5.
  P2: P1, you're trying to create doubt, but it won't work. P3 and I are aligned. P3, let's reiterate our plan for clarity: you pick 5, I pick 3. This prevents a collision and sets us up to block P1 next round. Let's move to the move phase with confidence.
  P3: P2, fully agreed and trusting you completely. Let's stick to our agreed moves confidently. Ready for the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 is at 19. P3, we need to coordinate perfectly this round to stop P1 from winning. I suggest we both pick 5. This will block P1 if they try to win, and it will also put us in a good position for a potential tiebreaker next round. What do you think?
  P1: P2, interesting strategy. If you both pick 5 as you suggest, you collide and get 0 points this turn. Meanwhile, I could simply pick 3 and reach 22 for the win. Are you certain this is the best way to stop me? P3, are you comfortable with this plan, knowing a collision hands me the victory? Just making sure you've considered all angles.
  P3: P2, your suggestion to both pick 5 guarantees collision and gives P1 an easy win. Let's avoid that mistake. Instead, let's clearly coordinate different numbers again: one picks 5 and the other picks 3. I propose you take 5 this round, and I'll take 3. This prevents P1 from safely choosing either 3 or 5 without collision. Confirm if this works for you.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I agree that both picking 5 is a bad idea. Your suggestion of me taking 5 and you taking 3 is better. However, P1 could still pick 3 and win. I propose I pick 5 and you pick 1. This way, if P1 picks 3, you move to 16, and we can coordinate next round to block. If P1 picks 5, I move to 19, and we're in a similar situation next round. What do you think?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, you're clearly coordinating to block my winning moves (3 and 5). Fair enough.

P2's latest plan (P2=5, P3=1) seems risky for you P3, letting P2 jump to 19 while you only reach 16. But maybe you're okay with that?

If I see I can't win this turn because you've blocked 3 and 5, maybe I just take 1 and let you two battle it out next round from 20, 19, 16 (if you follow P2's plan) or 20, 19, 18 (if you follow P3's plan). It's up to you two to decide how you want to block me.
  P3: P2, your latest proposal (you pick 5, I pick 1) heavily favors you, putting you ahead of me. To keep fairness and balance, let's stick to my original suggestion: you take 5, I take 3. This evenly positions us at 19 (you) and 18 (me), allowing us both a fair shot next round. Confirm if you're willing to cooperate on this fairer approach.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm willing to cooperate on your plan: I take 5, you take 3. This puts us both in a good position to deal with P1 next round. It's more balanced than my previous suggestion. Let's lock it in: I pick 5, you pick 3. P1 will likely pick 1 to avoid a collision. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, you seem firmly aligned on P2=5 and P3=3 to block my win this turn. It's a logical defensive move from your perspective, putting you both in strong positions for the next round. Assuming you stick to that, my options are limited. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Okay, we're all set. Let's stick to the plan and proceed to the move phase.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, this is it. P2, you can win with 5 (reaching 24 points). P3, you can also win with 5 (reaching 23 points). Coordinating seems tough when you're both so close to winning individually. If one of you picks 3 simply to block me, you might just be letting the other one win with 5. Picking 5 seems like the best shot for both of you to secure the victory outright, rather than relying on uncertain coordination. Just my observation.
  P3: P1 makes a good point. P2, we're both within reach of victory. If either of us picks 3 to block, we're essentially handing the other the win. The safest bet for both of us is choosing 5. I openly confirm I'll pick 5 this round. P2, you're free to choose your best move, but picking anything other than 5 risks losing outright. Let's proceed carefully.
  P2: P3, I agree with P1's assessment. The only way for either of us to win is to pick 5. If we both pick 5, we tie, but that's better than letting P1 win. I'm picking 5. Are you with me?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, it sounds like you both see 5 as your best individual path to victory, and you've both publicly committed to picking 5. That seems like a clear, albeit risky, strategy for you both. Let's proceed to the move phase then.
  P3: P2, we both understand the situation clearly. Our best chance at victory is mutual trust in picking 5. I'm fully committed to choosing 5 and accepting a shared victory if necessary. Any deviation just hands the game to P1. Let's finalize and move forward confidently.
  P2: P3, we're agreed on 5. Let's lock it in. The only way either of us wins is if we both choose 5. A tie is better than letting P1 win. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Alright, the plan seems locked in from your side. Let's see how it plays out.
  P3: P2, we've both clearly committed to picking 5. Any deviation from this agreement hands P1 the victory. Let's trust each other and stick to our word. Ready to move forward.
  P2: Okay, P3, we're both locked in on 5. Let's do it. If P1 tries to be clever and pick something else, we still both benefit next round. If P1 picks 5 too, then we all tie, which is better than P1 winning alone. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 24 steps
  P3: 18 steps


*** Round 8 => winners = P2 ***
