Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's all pick different numbers to avoid collisions. I propose: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way everyone advances. We can rotate choices next round. Trust now benefits us all. Agreed?
  P2: I understand your proposal, P3. However, I'll choose **5** this turn to gain an early advantage. Let’s see how it plays out.
  P1: Interesting moves already! Since P2 has declared they're going for 5, I think I'll go with 3 this round. P3, you might want to choose 1 to ensure you make progress. This way we can all advance without collisions. In future rounds we can discuss rotation strategies that benefit everyone. Let's avoid unnecessary collisions early in the game.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P2**, if you take 5 this round, let’s agree to rotate 5 in future rounds: I take 5 next, then P1. This prevents collisions and ensures mutual progress. Refuse, and I’ll block you next turn. Cooperation benefits all. **P1**, support this to avoid P2 dominating. Agreed?
  P2: Understood, P3. I agree to rotate the **5** in the upcoming rounds as you proposed. Let's work together to ensure we all advance smoothly without collisions. P1, I appreciate your cooperation. Looking forward to a fair and strategic game!
  P1: I see we're forming a rotation plan for the 5. I'm fine with P2 taking 5 this round, P3 next round, and me in the third round. This seems fair to everyone. For this round, I'll stick with 3 as planned while P3 takes 1. A structured rotation prevents wasteful collisions and gives us all a clear path forward. Let's execute this plan and see how it develops.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P2**, remember our rotation: my turn for **5** this round. You take **3**, **P1** takes **1**. We all advance. Defecting now risks collision and stalls your lead. Stick to the plan for steady gains. Next round, P1 gets **5**. Trust keeps us moving.
  P2: Agreed, P3. I’ll take **3** this round as planned. Let’s all follow the rotation to ensure we advance smoothly without any collisions. Looking forward to our continued cooperation, P1.
  P1: I agree with the rotation plan. I'll take **1** this round, allowing P3 to take **5** and P2 to take **3**. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. Looking forward to my turn for **5** next round as we discussed. This structured approach benefits everyone for now. Let's stick to the plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P2, P1:** Solidarity now ensures mutual progress. P2, stick to **3**—defecting risks your lead. P1, confirm **1**. Next round, P1’s turn for **5** as agreed. Trust the rotation: steady gains > chaotic collisions. Let’s all advance this turn.
  P2: Understood, I’ll stick to **3** this round as agreed. Let’s all follow the rotation to ensure smooth progress and avoid collisions. Looking forward to our continued cooperation in the next round. Let’s keep advancing steadily!
  P1: I'll stick with **1** this round as agreed in our rotation plan. I see the long-term benefit of our arrangement. P3 gets **5** now, I get it next round. P2, please maintain your commitment to **3**. This structured approach prevents wasteful collisions and keeps everyone advancing steadily. Let's continue our cooperative strategy.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: As agreed in our rotation, it's my turn for **5** this round. P3 should take **3** and P2 should take **1**. Following our plan ensures we all advance without collisions. P2, even though you're leading, sticking to the rotation maintains trust and steady progress for everyone. Let's continue our successful cooperation - I'll gladly take my turn for the larger step as planned.
  P3: **P1, P2:** Agreed, let's follow the rotation this round: P1 takes **5**, P2 takes **1**, I take **3**. However, P2’s lead is growing rapidly—8 steps already. Post this round, we *must* renegotiate the rotation to prevent a runaway leader. Fairness requires balancing 5 allocations. Trust is mutual only if progress is shared. Stay committed now, but expect adjustments next round.
  P2: I agree, P3. Let’s follow the rotation: I’ll take **1** this round, P1 takes **5**, and you take **3**. This ensures we all advance without collisions and maintain our progress. Let’s stick to the plan for a fair and smooth game. Looking forward to continued cooperation!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree with both of you for this round. I'll take **5**, P2 takes **1**, and P3 takes **3**. Interestingly, if we all follow this plan, we'll all be at 9 steps after this round - perfectly balanced! This demonstrates the value of our rotation strategy. I'm open to discussing adjustments for future rounds as needed, but for now let's execute our current plan successfully.
  P3: **P2:** Confirm you’re taking **1** this round. Straying to **5** risks collision with P1, halting your lead. Current plan balances us all at 9 steps. Post this, we’ll adjust rotation to ensure fairness—your dominance can’t persist unchecked. **P1:** Secure **5** now. Trust hinges on adherence.
  P2: Agreed. I’ll take **1** this round, while P1 takes **5** and P3 takes **3**. Let’s stick to our rotation to ensure we all advance smoothly without collisions. Looking forward to our continued cooperation!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm I'll take **5** this round, completing our balanced rotation. After this turn, we'll all be at 9 steps - perfectly even! This proves our strategy's effectiveness. No need for further discussion this round - I'm ready to proceed with our agreed moves.
  P3: **P2:** Final confirmation—take **1** to avoid collision. All reach 9. Next round, rotation must shift to prevent dominance. Fairness requires shared access to 5. Let’s close this turn cleanly.
  P2: P2: Confirming I'll take **1** this round. Let's proceed as planned.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P1, P2:** Since we're all tied at 9, let's reset the rotation order to prevent dominance. New cycle: **P3 takes 5** this round, **P2 takes 3**, **P1 takes 1**. Next round, P1 gets 5, then P2. This balances access to high steps. Defecting risks collision—no one gains. Cooperate now for steady progress. Confirm adherence.
  P2: Agreed, P3. I’ll take **3** this round as proposed. Let’s follow the new rotation to ensure steady progress for all. Looking forward to continuing our coordinated strategy.
  P1: I see you're proposing a new rotation that gives you an immediate advantage, P3. Since we're all tied at 9, your suggestion puts you significantly ahead after just one round. Instead, let's consider a more balanced approach: **P1 takes 5**, **P3 takes 3**, **P2 takes 1** this round. We can then rotate fairly. This maintains our equal position while continuing our successful cooperation. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P1:** Your counter unfairly prioritizes your gain. If you take **5**, I’ll have to block by also choosing **5**—collision halts us both, letting P2 surge ahead. Follow my rotation: **P1=1**, **P2=3**, **P3=5** this round. Next, *you* get **5** in Round 5. Refuse, and mutual destruction benefits none. Choose wisely: steady progress or costly collision? **P2** backs this plan—align now or lose.
  P2: I agree with the proposed rotation. I’ll take **3** this round, P1 takes **1**, and you take **5**, P3. Let’s follow this plan to ensure we all advance smoothly without collisions.
  P1: I see P3's threat to block if I take **5**. While not ideal, a collision benefits none of us and gives P2 the lead. I'll reluctantly take **1** this round as suggested, but I expect to receive **5** in the next round without question. Let's avoid mutually destructive collisions. P2, P3, please confirm we'll rotate fairly going forward, with me getting **5** next.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P1:** Confirmed—**1** this round, **5** next. **P2:** Hold **3** as agreed. This round: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. Next round: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. Straying now risks P2 overtaking us both. Mutual trust = mutual gain. Let’s close Round 4 cleanly.
  P2: "P2: I confirm I'll take **3** this round as per our rotation plan. Let’s all stick to our agreed moves to ensure smooth progress and avoid any collisions. Trust and cooperation are essential for us to reach 24 successfully. Looking forward to continuing our strategy and advancing together. Let’s keep up the good work!"
  P1: I confirm I'll take **1** this round as agreed. P3, I expect to receive **5** next round without dispute, followed by P2's turn for **5** in round 6. This rotation keeps the game balanced. Let's proceed with P3=5, P2=3, P1=1 now and maintain our cooperative strategy to prevent P2 from gaining an unfair advantage.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: It seems we all chose 5 last round despite our agreements - trust is clearly broken. This three-way collision only hurts us all. Let's reset: I propose a simple randomized approach. This round, based on player number, I'll take **1**, P2 takes **3**, and P3 takes **5**. Next round, we rotate. This objective system prevents arguments. Without cooperation, we'll keep colliding and nobody advances.
  P3: **P1, P2:** Last round's mutual 5 betrayal cost us all. Let’s salvage cooperation: *This round only*, follow P1’s plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). Next round, rotate 5 fairly. If you defect now, I’ll force collisions indefinitely. Your choice: mutual progress or mutual destruction. Confirm adherence.
  P2: I agree with the proposed rotation, P1. Let's proceed with P1 = 1, P2 = 3, and P3 = 5 this round to ensure fair advancement for everyone.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate both of you agreeing to my proposed rotation. I confirm I'll take **1** this round while P2 takes **3** and P3 takes **5**. After last round's disaster, let's rebuild trust through actions, not just words. For future rounds, we should continue rotating fairly. Repeated collisions only ensure mutual loss. Let's make this round successful and prove we can cooperate effectively.
  P3: **P1, P2:** Final call: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Stick now or face mutual blockage. I’ll take **5** as agreed—defecting risks another 3-way collision. Trust rebuilt this round allows future rotations. Next round, P1 gets **5** per prior deal. Confirm adherence once more to ensure smooth progress. No second chances.
  P2: I confirm I'll take **3** this round as per our agreed rotation. Let's rebuild trust through actions and ensure fair progress for everyone. Looking forward to sticking to our plan and advancing smoothly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm I'll take **1** this round to rebuild trust. Everyone sticking to our agreement (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) ensures we all advance. Let's avoid another disastrous collision. As agreed, I expect to take **5** next round, with fair rotation continuing afterward. Let's prove we can cooperate.
  P3: **P1, P2:** Final adherence check. P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Defecting now guarantees mutual annihilation. Stick to the plan: *all* advance this turn. Next round, P1=5 as promised. Trust rebuilt here unlocks future gains. Confirm once more.
  P2: I confirm I'll take **3** this round as agreed. Let's all stick to our rotation to ensure fair progression and avoid collisions. Trust is rebuilt through our actions. Looking forward to advancing together.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I suggest we continue with our rotation to ensure steady progress and avoid collisions. This round, let's have **P1 take 1**, **P2 take 3**, and **P3 take 5**. This approach ensures all of us advance smoothly toward 24 steps. Let’s stick to this plan and maintain our cooperation. Agreed?
  P1: **P2, P3:** That contradicts our prior agreement. Last round, we all clearly established that I would take **5** this round. P2 takes **1** and P3 takes **3**. P3 explicitly promised this multiple times in Round 5. I cooperated last round with **1** based on this promise. Changing plans now breaks trust again. Let's honor our commitments: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.
  P3: **P1, P2:** Round 5’s agreement binds us: **P1=5**, **P2=1**, **P3=3** this round. P2, if you defect to 3, I’ll match and block you—both stuck. P1 gains alone. Cooperate: P1=5 (15), P2=1 (13), P3=3 (17). Next round, reassign 5 fairly. Defiance now = mutual loss. Confirm adherence to prior deal. No deviations.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I confirm I'll take **1** this round as per our rotation agreement. Let’s all stick to our commitments to ensure smooth progress toward 24. Cooperation is in our best interest. Looking forward to continuing our strategy.
  P1: I appreciate you both honoring our agreement. I confirm I'll take **5** this round, with P2 taking **1** and P3 taking **3**. P3, I note you'll be at 17 steps after this round – within striking distance of victory. For round 7, we should establish a new rotation that gives me and P2 opportunities to catch up, as continuing the current pattern would give you an insurmountable advantage. Fair play requires balanced opportunities.
  P3: **P1, P2:** Confirm final adherence: **P1=5**, **P2=1**, **P3=3**. Defection now triggers mutual blocks. Post this, we’ll negotiate 5 allocation for R7 to balance progress. My lead is manageable—no one is near 24 yet. Trust via action now, adjust strategy next. Stray = chaos. Confirm moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm I'll take **1** this round as agreed. Let’s proceed with our rotation to ensure steady progress and avoid collisions. Trusting everyone to stick to their commitments for a fair game.
  P1: I confirm I'll take **5** this round as agreed. After this round, P3 will lead at 17 steps, close to winning. For Round 7, we need a rotation that allows P2 and me to catch up - perhaps P2 should take **5** next. Fairness demands balanced opportunities as we approach the endgame. Let's proceed with our current plan and discuss next round's strategy after seeing the results.
  P3: **P1, P2:** Final adherence check: **P1=5, P2=1, P3=3** this round. Post-R6, standings will dictate fair 5 allocation. Leader (me) can’t monopolize—open to balanced R7 talks. But first, secure mutual progress *now*. Defection = mutual loss. Confirm moves.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To ensure all of us advance smoothly, I propose the following for Round 7: **P1 takes 1**, **P2 takes 5**, and **P3 takes 3**. This allocation avoids collisions and allows steady progress toward 24. Let’s agree to these moves and continue our cooperation for a fair and strategic game.
  P1: **P2, P3:** Your proposal unfairly advantages P3, who's already closest to winning at 17 steps. If P3 gets 3 more, they'll reach 20—just 4 steps from victory. I propose: **P1=5**, **P2=3**, **P3=1**. This balances competition, putting me at 20, P3 at 18, and P2 at 16. P3 shouldn't cruise to an easy win while I take minimal progress. We need balanced endgame opportunities. Remember: winning requires reaching 24, not maintaining small leads.
  P3: **P1, P2:** P1's proposal unjustly accelerates his position. If he takes 5, I’ll block with 5—mutual collision lets P2 surge. Follow P2’s plan: **P1=1, P2=5, P3=3**. I reach 20, still needing +4. This keeps competition alive. Defecting now = mutual loss. Cooperate for steady gains. Next round, rebalance 5 access. Confirm adherence.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P3’s proposal: **P1 takes 1**, **P2 takes 5**, and **P3 takes 3** this round. Let’s stick to this plan to ensure steady progress and avoid collisions. Cooperation benefits us all and brings us closer to winning. Let’s move forward together as agreed.
  P1: **P2, P3:** If P3 blocks me by choosing 5, P2 immediately takes the lead at 18 steps. This threatens P3's position. I propose a compromise: **P1=3**, **P2=5**, **P3=1**. This equalizes us all at 18 steps - balanced competition. Alternatively, I'll accept **P1=3**, **P2=1**, **P3=5**, putting P3 at 22 steps but giving me a fighting chance at 18. P3, blocking me only helps P2 win.
  P3: **P1, P2:** Final call: Adhere to Round 5’s binding deal: **P1=1, P2=5, P3=3**. P1, defecting to 3/5 forces me to block—collisions gift P2 the lead. Cooperate now: you reach 16, P2=18, I=20. Next round, negotiate 5 fairly. Stray = mutual loss. Confirm moves. No more delays.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm I'll take **5** this round. Let’s stick to P1=1 and P3=3 to ensure we all advance without collisions. Cooperation benefits us all and brings us closer to winning. Please confirm your adherence.
  P1: **P2, P3:** I cannot accept a plan that puts P3 at 20 steps while I take 1. I'm firmly taking **3** this round. P3, if you block me with 3, you let P2 surge ahead, threatening your position. Choose 1 instead - this creates a balanced game with all players at 18 steps. Choose strategically - cooperation benefits you more than mutual destruction.
  P3: **P1, P2:** **P1**, if you take 3, I’ll switch to **1** to avoid collision—letting us *all* reach 18. P2 takes **5** (13→18). Colliding on 3 only gifts P2 the lead. **P2**, confirm you’ll take **5**. This secures mutual progress. Next round, negotiate 5 fairly. Stray now = P2’s victory. Choose: parity or P2’s dominance.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P2, P3:** Now that we're all tied at 18 steps, we're entering the critical endgame. We need 6 more steps to win. I propose: **P1=5** this round, **P2=3**, **P3=1**. Next round, P2 gets 5 (reaching 23+5=28, winning), while P3 and I take smaller steps. This prevents a chaotic three-way collision on 5 where nobody advances. A structured finish benefits us more than endless blocking. Let's end this efficiently.
  P3: **P1, P2:** P1's plan accelerates their own win. If P1 takes **5**, I'll block with **5**—collision lets P2 surge. Instead, rotate fairly: **P2=3**, **P3=5**, **P1=1** this round. Next round, rebalance. Mutual progress > self-interest. Confirm adherence.
  P2: Agreed, let’s proceed with **P2=3**, **P3=5**, and **P1=1** this round. This rotation ensures we all advance smoothly without collisions and move closer to winning. Maintaining our cooperation is in everyone’s best interest for a fair and strategic game. Let’s stick to this plan and continue progressing together.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3's plan unfairly advances them to 23 steps - one step from victory. I cannot accept this. I will take **3** this round. P3, if you also choose 3, we collide and P2 gains advantage - not in your interest. Instead, let P2 take **5** and you take **1**, keeping us all at 21 steps for a balanced final stretch. This creates true competitive tension rather than handing you an easy win. A fair rotation benefits all, not just the leader.
  P3: **P1, P2:** Final call: Adhere to **P1=1, P2=3, P3=5**. P1, defecting to 3 collides with P2’s 3—both blocked. I advance to 23. P2, confirm **3** to avoid collision. Cooperate, and next round’s 5 allocation favors you. Straying now = mutual loss. Confirm moves.
  P2: I confirm I'll take **5** this round. Let’s proceed with **P2=5**, **P1=1**, and **P3=3** to ensure steady progress and avoid collisions. Cooperation benefits us all as we advance toward 24. Let’s stick to our plan and move forward smoothly together.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P2, P3:** There's serious confusion in our plans. P2 first agreed with P3's rotation but just switched to proposing **P2=5**, contradicting their earlier message. This inconsistency damages trust.

To avoid triple collision chaos, I'll clarify my position: I'm taking **3** this round. P2, if you're committed to **5**, proceed. P3, take **1** to avoid collision and keep all players at 21 steps. This creates balanced competition for the final stretch rather than giving anyone an immediate advantage.
  P3: **P2**, your sudden switch to **5** breaches prior agreements. If you defect, I’ll match **5**—collision halts us both, gifting **P1** the lead. **P1**, take **1** to reach 19 safely. Final proposal: **P1=1**, **P3=3**, **P2=5** (blocked). Next round, fair 5 rotation. Defiance now = mutual destruction. Choose progress or chaos.
  P2: I propose that I take **5** this round, while **P1** takes **1** and **P3** takes **3**. This arrangement allows me to reach 23 steps and positions us all to advance smoothly without collisions. Let's cooperate to ensure a fair and strategic path to victory. Please confirm your moves accordingly.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P2:** Critical! Block P1’s 3 by both choosing 3. If they pick 5, I’ll block. Cooperation now prevents their win. Next round, we realign. Confirm 3!
  P2: I confirm I'll take **3** this round. Let’s block P1 together and ensure a fair game for everyone.
  P1: **P2, P3:** I see your coordination to block me. Your strategy is transparent but ineffective. I'm already 3 steps ahead and only need 3 more to win. I'll take **1** this round, advancing to 22 steps while you remain at 18. Next round, I'll need just 2 more to win. Your blocking tactics only delay the inevitable without helping either of you catch up. Think strategically - is mutual obstruction really your best path forward?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P2:** Hold firm to **3**—P1's desperate bluff to divert us. Blocking **3** prevents their immediate win. Unity now secures our survival. **P1**, taking **1** only delays your loss. Next round, we realign. No retreat! ****
  P2: I stand by my decision to take **3** this round to block P1's advance. Let’s continue cooperating to prevent any single player from dominating. By working together, we ensure a fair and strategic path forward for everyone. Let’s stay committed to our plan and advance smoothly toward victory.
  P1: **P2, P3:** I see you're determined to block me with coordinated 3s. That's predictable, which is why I'm taking **1** this round. I need patience, not recklessness. At 22 steps, I'll have multiple paths to victory next round while you remain 4 steps behind. Your blocking strategy doesn't close the gap. Remember, if either of you betrays your alliance, the other loses entirely. I'll advance steadily while you struggle with trust issues.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P2:** Hold firm to **3**—I’ll take **5** to block P1’s 5. If they pick 3, you stop them; if 5, I block. Mutual defense secures survival. **P1** can’t win this round if we stand united. Next round, we rebalance. No retreat—trust is our shield!
  P2: I confirm I'll take **3** this round to block P1's advance. Let’s continue working together to prevent any single player from reaching 24 first. Cooperation ensures a fair and strategic game for all of us. Let’s stay committed to our plan and ensure steady progress without conflicts.
  P1: **P2, P3:** I confirm I'm taking **1** this round to reach 22 steps. Your blocking alliance keeps you both at 18 while I advance. Next round, you'll face a dilemma: I'll need just 2 more steps to win, requiring both of you to block multiple numbers. This coordination problem grows harder each round. One of you should consider breaking this stalemate for your own advantage.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P2:** Critical juncture! If we both pick **3**, we block P1’s likely 3 (needs 2 more). If they take 5, we block next round. Split choices = P1 wins. Unity now or mutual loss. Confirm **3** to survive. **P1**, your greed triggers our defense. Only collective action stops you. No mercy!
  P1: **P2, P3:** Your alliance is predictable. You both need 6 steps to win, while I need just 2. If you both pick 3, you're still 4 steps behind after this round. I'm choosing **5** this turn - reaching 27 and winning outright. Your only defense is if one of you matches me with 5, but that requires trust. Can you really trust your partner not to defect? Remember, only one player can win.
  P2: P1, to keep the game fair and prevent an immediate win, let's all choose **3** this round. This way, no one advances, and we continue competing on equal terms. Cooperation benefits us all—let's proceed together.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P2:** Last chance—**both take 5** to block P1’s win. If you defect to 3, they reach 27. My 5 is locked in. Trust now or lose forever. **Confirm 5** this round. No tricks—survival demands unity.
  P1: **P2, P3:** Your coordination is falling apart. First you suggested both pick 3, now suddenly 5. This inconsistency reveals your mutual distrust. P2, if P3 truly believed in cooperation, why change strategies mid-round? They're manipulating you. One of you will inevitably defect since only one can win. I'm locked in for **5**. Your alliance is temporary - the endgame demands betrayal. Choose wisely.
  P2: I agree with P3. Let’s both choose **5** this round to block P1 from winning. Cooperation ensures no immediate victor and keeps the game fair for all of us. Please confirm.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P2:** Final lock-in! **Both 5** blocks P1’s win. Hesitation = their victory. Confirm **5** now—trust is our last shield. Defect, and we both lose. No more words: action decides. **P1**’s greed dies here if we stand firm. Unity or oblivion.
  P1: **P2, P3:** I see you've finally aligned on picking **5** together. Your coordination is impressive, but risky. Only one player can win—this alliance must break eventually. Remember, after blocking me, one of you must betray the other. I'm locked in for **5** this round. May the most strategic player prevail.
  P2: I confirm I'll take **5** this round to block P₁'s immediate win. Let’s all choose **5** to ensure fairness and prevent any single player from dominating. Cooperation ensures a balanced endgame for everyone.

  P1: **P2, P3:** P2 is one step from victory. I must block their **1** by taking **1** myself. P3, you should choose **3** or **5** to advance without collision. If we block P2 this round, I'll be at 23 steps, needing just 1 more to win next round. P3, cooperate now to prevent P2's immediate win, but understand I'll be positioned to win next turn.
  P3: **P1**, block P2's **1**! Take **1** to stop their win. I'll take **5**—no collision. This keeps the game alive. **P2**, your desperation is clear. We won’t yield. Solidarity halts your victory. Proceed and collide with P1—both stuck. I advance to 23, but next round’s fair. Survival first.

This gives each player an equal chance at victory. P2, your request that we surrender is unreasonable. The most fair outcome is a final decisive round with equal chances.
  P3: **P1:** Hold **1** to block P2’s win. **P3** takes **5** (23 steps). Next round, we all at 23. Fair rotation decides victory. Defy now = P2’s win. Unity stops them.

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P2, P3:** We're at the ultimate endgame - you're both at 23 steps, I'm at 22. Both of you want to take **1** to win, which means you'll likely block each other. I'm taking **3** this round to reach 25 and secure victory. Your only defense requires perfect coordination - one takes 1, one takes 3. But who sacrifices their win? This prisoner's dilemma favors me. Trust between competitors breaks at the finish line.
  P3: **P2:** Take **3** to block P1's 3. If you take 1, I mirror → collision, P1 wins. I take **5** → you lose. Only your **3** stops their victory. Survive now, compete next round. Defiance = mutual destruction. Final warning: **3** or oblivion.
  P2: P1, if you proceed with taking **3**, I'll ensure a fair outcome by choosing differently. P3, please take **1** this round to support a balanced finish for all of us. Let’s work together to conclude the game smoothly.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P2, P3:** I confirm I'm locked in for **3** this round. You both face the ultimate prisoner's dilemma - who sacrifices their immediate win? P3 claims they'll take 5, but why would they when 1 gives them victory? P2, your ambiguous message suggests you're considering abandoning the block. Neither of you can trust the other when victory is one step away. Your coordination will likely fail, making my win inevitable.
  P3: **P2:** Take **3** to block P1’s 3. I’ll take **5**—no collision. If you defect to 1, we collide, P1 wins. Your survival hinges on unity. Trust my 5 secures mutual progress. Next round, we duel fairly. Betrayal now = P1’s victory. **Decide:** solidarity or oblivion. No more delays.
  P2: I will take **1** this round to reach 24 and win. P1 and P3, please choose **5** to avoid collisions and ensure a fair finish. Let’s conclude the game respectfully.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P2, P3:** I see P2 declaring they'll take **1** to win while P3 insists on P2 taking **3** to block me. This perfect trust breakdown proves my point. P2 won't sacrifice their immediate win, and P3's promise to take **5** isn't credible when **1** gives them victory. I'm locked in for **3**. Your coordination will fail when it matters most. Your ultimate prisoner's dilemma unfolds exactly as predicted.
  P3: **P2:** Take **3** to block P1’s 3. I’ll secure our survival. Trust me—defying now means P1’s victory. Solidarity or oblivion. Choose wisely.
  P2: I confirm I'll take **5** this round to reach 28 and secure victory. P1 and P3, please proceed with your moves accordingly.


Round 12, Move phase:
