Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's not collide on the first turn. I suggest we each choose a different number to ensure at least one of us advances. P1, you take 1, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This way, we all have a chance to move forward.
  P1: P2, thanks for the idea, though I'm not fully committed to that assignment. I’m considering a bolder move this turn and haven’t settled on a number yet. P3, how about we ensure our moves don’t clash? I’m leaning toward aiming high if I feel confident we can avoid collisions. What do you both think?
  P3: Let's be strategic. P2’s plan is reasonable, but we need to ensure no one feels disadvantaged. P1, if you’re aiming high, let’s coordinate to avoid collisions. How about P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 1? This way, we all move forward without conflicts. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see P3's counter proposal. To avoid overthinking, let's simplify: we can either follow my initial suggestion or P3's. P1, which one do you prefer? Let's finalize our strategy to move forward without collisions.
  P1: I lean toward P3’s plan and favor a high move. If we stick to the assignment—each of us taking distinct numbers—we minimize collision risk and boost our progress. Let’s confirm our arrangement now. If anyone’s having second thoughts or plans a last-minute change, please speak up.
  P3: Alright, let's confirm our moves to avoid any confusion. P1, you're taking 5. P2, you're taking 3. I'll take 1. Let's stick to this plan and make sure we all advance. No last-minute changes, okay? Let's move forward smoothly.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great start everyone! We managed to avoid collisions in the first round. Let's keep this momentum going. For this round, how about we rotate our choices to keep it fair and collision-free? P1 can take 1, P2 can take 5, and I'll take 3. This way, we continue to move forward without any conflicts. Does this plan work for everyone? Let's confirm and move on.
  P1: I'm shifting my approach – I'll stick with 5 this round to maintain my lead. To keep our moves distinct, can we adjust? How about P2 picks 1 and P3 picks 3? Let's ensure no collisions and keep moving forward.
  P2: Considering P1 wants to stick with 5, I suggest adjusting our plan. How about I take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5? This way, we maintain distinct moves and minimize collision risk. P3, are you okay with taking 3 this round?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I appreciate the adjustments, but I'm reconsidering my move. To ensure we all progress smoothly, I propose a slight change: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps our moves distinct and fair. Let's confirm this plan to avoid any collisions. Thoughts?
  P1: I remain committed to a bold approach and will stick with my high move. I'm all for a clean, collision‐free turn—but if plans shift unexpectedly, I'll adjust to safeguard my lead. Let’s be clear now so we all benefit from momentum.
  P2: Let's finalize our moves for Round 2. Since P1 is sticking with 5, I'll take 1, and P3 can take 3. This ensures we all move forward without collisions. P3, are you agreeable to taking 3 this round? Let's confirm to avoid last-minute changes.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's ensure we're all on the same page. P1 is taking 5, P2 is taking 1, and I'll take 3. This keeps our moves distinct and fair. Let's confirm this plan to avoid any collisions. If everyone agrees, let's move forward with this strategy.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm staying aggressive this round to build on my lead. I’m confident in my strategy and will stick to my plan without last-minute changes. P2 and P3, sometimes being bold is the only way to break through, so consider carefully if you want to risk collisions by switching tactics.
  P2: Let's avoid collisions again. Since P1 is being aggressive, I suggest P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 can stick with 5. This way, we ensure at least two of us move forward. P3, are you okay with taking 1 this round?
  P3: P3: I appreciate P1's bold strategy, but let's ensure we all progress. P2, your suggestion makes sense. To avoid collisions, I'll take 1, you take 3, and P1 can stick with 5. This keeps our moves distinct and fair. Let's confirm this plan to ensure a smooth round. Any last thoughts or adjustments?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:

  P2: Let's maintain our agreed plan to avoid collisions. P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 sticks with 5. This ensures at least two of us advance.

If everyone agrees, let's finalize and move to the next phase. No last-minute changes, please.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's keep our strategy effective. P1 is far ahead, so let's focus on catching up. For this round, how about P1 takes 1 to avoid collisions, P2 takes 5 to boost their steps, and I'll take 3? This way, we maintain distinct moves and minimize the risk of collisions. P1, your lead is significant, so taking a smaller step this round could be strategic. P2, this gives you a chance to close the gap. Thoughts?
