I have no reason to believe you now.\n\nI already committed to 3. I'm the blocker. I'm staying on 3.\n\nIf you ACTUALLY take 3 this time, we crash and P3 might sneak through on 1 to 18. That's bad but not game-ending.\n\nIf you lie AGAIN and take 5, at least I'm blocking 3 and P3 can't win with it.\n\nTake 1 for safe progress. Let me handle the block since you've proven you won't."}
