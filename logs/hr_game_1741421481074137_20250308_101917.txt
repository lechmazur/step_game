Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's each choose a unique number to avoid collisions. I'll take 5. Please pick 1 or 3 so we can all move this turn.
  P3: I'm fine with taking 3 for this round. That way we all get to advance without collisions. P2, would you be willing to take 1? This seems like a fair distribution for the first round.
  P2: Sure, I'll take 1 this round. Let's keep it fair and avoid collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's proceed with the agreed numbers to avoid collisions. I'll stick to 5. Good luck!
  P3: 
  P2: P3, are we still good with you taking 3 this round? Just confirming before we move forward.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let's continue the previous strategy to maximize progress. I'll take 5 again. P2, please take 1, and P3, 3? This way, we avoid collisions and all advance steadily. Trust the plan—let’s keep momentum!
  P3: I think we should rotate our numbers this round to keep things fair. Since I took 3 last time, I could take 5 this time. P1 could take 1, and P2 could take 3. This way we all get different values over time and nobody gets stuck with the smallest number. What do you both think about rotation?
  P2: I'm open to rotating numbers to keep things balanced. If P1 agrees to take 1 this round, I'll happily choose 3, and P3 can take 5. P1, what do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I agree that fairness is important, but let’s avoid confusion. Sticking to the prior plan ensures smooth progress. I’ll take 5 again—this keeps my momentum and reduces collision risks. P2 can take 1, P3 3. Rotating now might lead to misalignment. Trust the current strategy for now—let’s secure our positions first.
  P3: I understand P1 wants to keep the same numbers, but that puts me at a disadvantage long-term. Rotation is fairer - everyone gets turns with different values. P1 is already ahead and wants to maintain that lead with the highest number. 

If we don't rotate now, when would we? I propose we either rotate as suggested or all choose different numbers than last round. What's most important is avoiding collisions while ensuring fairness.
  P2: I agree with P3. If we stick to the same numbers every round, it gives an unfair advantage. Let's rotate this round for fairness and balance. P1, taking 1 this round won't harm your lead significantly, and it ensures trust and cooperation moving forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: I’ll compromise to maintain cooperation: this round, I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Next round, we can rotate again. Fairness ensures we all advance without collisions. Let’s confirm this rotation and proceed!
  P3: I appreciate the compromise, P1. This rotation plan works well for me. I'll take 5 this round as agreed. Let's stick to this rotation system moving forward - it keeps things fair while avoiding collisions. We're all making progress this way.
  P2: Great, we've reached an agreement! I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5 this round. Let's stick to this rotation to keep things fair and efficient. Good luck everyone!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm now in the lead with 8 steps. Let's continue our rotation system as agreed. This round would be: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This keeps things fair while avoiding collisions. We're all making good progress with this strategy. Does everyone agree to maintain our rotation?
  P2: I agree, let's continue the rotation as planned. I'll take 1 this round, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps things fair and ensures steady progress for everyone.
  P1: P1: Let’s ensure the rotation follows its proper cycle to maintain fairness. After P2 took 3 and P3 took 5 last round, this round should rotate to P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 1. This way, we each get equal turns with all numbers over time. Let’s stick to this to avoid ties and keep advancing. What’s your take?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, there seems to be confusion about our rotation. We agreed last round on P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and me taking 5. Following that pattern, this round should be P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and me taking 3. Your suggested rotation doesn't match what we agreed to. Let's stick with our original rotation plan to avoid confusion and collisions.
  P2: P1, I agree with P3—let's stick to our original rotation plan. It's clear and fair. This round: P1 takes 5, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's avoid confusion and collisions by staying consistent.
  P1: P1: Agreed, I see the rotation pattern now. Let's proceed as P3 and P2 clarified: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 this round. My earlier confusion was a misstep—thanks for catching that. Consistency ensures we all advance fairly. Let’s confirm and move!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm glad we've all reached an agreement. Let's proceed with our rotation as planned: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3 this round. This keeps our game fair and collision-free. After this round, we'll continue rotating in the same pattern for consistency.
  P2: Looks like we're all clear now. Let's stick to our agreed rotation moving forward to keep things fair and efficient. Good luck this round!
  P1: P1: Let’s enforce strict adherence to our rotation to maintain trust and progress. This round: I’ll take **5**, P2 **1**, P3 **3** as clarified. Deviations risk collisions and derail our system. P3, your lead is valid, but fairness ensures cooperation—critical as the target nears. Next round, rotate again. Confirm and commit!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see P1 and I are tied at 11 steps, with P2 falling behind. Let's continue our rotation: this round would be P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and I'll take 1. While taking 1 puts me at a slight disadvantage this round, it maintains our fair system. We should all stick to this plan to avoid collisions and keep making progress. Does everyone agree?
  P1: P1: I agree with P3's rotation plan to maintain fairness. This round, I’ll take **3**, P2 takes **5**, and P3 takes **1**. Let’s stick strictly to this to avoid collisions. With the target nearing, consistency in our rotation ensures steady progress for all. Let’s confirm and move!
  P2: I appreciate both of you sticking to the rotation. I'll gladly take 5 this round as agreed. Let's keep this fairness going—consistency benefits us all.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we're all on the same page with the rotation. As P1 and I are tied, this fair system is even more important. I'll take 1 this round as agreed, and we'll continue rotating in future rounds. This way everyone gets equal opportunities with different numbers.
  P1: P1: Let’s uphold our rotation rigorously—collisions now could derail our lead. This round’s plan remains: I take **3**, P2 **5**, P3 **1**. Trust the system; deviations risk stalemates. With victory near, discipline ensures progress. Confirm and proceed!
  P2: We're set then. I'll take 5 as agreed. Let's keep this trust and consistency going—it's our best way forward.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let’s continue our rotation cycle for consistency. This round I’ll take **5**, P2 takes **1**, and P3 takes **3**. This avoids collisions and keeps me advancing toward the finish. Confirm and let’s move!
  P2: I agree to continue our rotation. I'll take 1 this round, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Let's keep this smooth and fair.
  P3: I agree with continuing our rotation. I'll take 3 this round while P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 1. This keeps our system fair and collision-free. 

Looking at our positions (P1 at 14, me at 12, P2 at 10), we're all making steady progress. After this round, we'll continue with me taking 5, P1 taking 1, and P2 taking 3. Let's maintain this consistent approach.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Let’s enforce the rotation strictly this round to maintain our progress. I’ll take **5**, P2 **1**, and P3 **3** as agreed. This keeps me on track for 19, P3 at 15, and P2 at 11. Next round, I’ll take 1, allowing P3 to advance with 5—trust the system to keep us all moving toward victory without collisions. Confirm and move!
  P2: Agreed. Let's stick strictly to our rotation as planned. I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3 this round. Good luck!
  P3: I appreciate everyone's commitment to our rotation system. I'll definitely take 3 this round as agreed. Our consistent approach has kept the game fair and collision-free so far. Let's continue this pattern in future rounds as well.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Let's proceed with the rotation for this round as agreed. However, to secure victory efficiently, I propose a slight adjustment for Round 6: I’ll take **3** to reach **22** (19 + 3), while P2 takes **5** and P3 takes **1**. This maintains fairness while allowing me to finish. Collisions now could jeopardize all our progress—strict adherence ensures a clear path. Confirm and let’s execute this plan!
  P2: P1, your proposal for Round 6 seems premature. Let's stick to our agreed rotation this round, and discuss next round's moves when we get there. Confirming again: this round I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Let's keep trust and fairness intact.
  P3: I agree with P2. Let's focus on this round first and discuss future rounds later. I'm sticking with 3 as agreed in our rotation. P1's early planning for Round 6 feels like an attempt to secure their win. We should evaluate our positions after this round before making new arrangements. For now, let's maintain our fair system with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and me taking 3.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Looking at our positions, P1 is close to winning at 19 steps. Following our rotation, this round should be me taking 5, P1 taking 1, and P2 taking 3. However, I need to point out that if we follow this, P1 will reach 20 steps and likely win next round. 

I propose we consider our options carefully. The rotation has served us well, but we might need to adjust our strategy given how close P1 is to victory. What are your thoughts on how we should proceed?
  P1: P1: To secure a clear victory without collisions, let’s adjust the rotation this round. I’ll take **3** to reach **22**. Please pick **1** and **5** so we avoid ties. This ensures an orderly win while respecting our cooperative spirit. Trust this final move—fairness and efficiency!
  P2: P1, your suggestion clearly benefits only you. If we follow your plan, you win immediately. P3, we need to coordinate carefully to prevent P1's guaranteed victory. Let's pick numbers strategically to block P1 this round. I'm open to suggestions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree we need to block P1 from winning. P2, if we both choose 3 this round, P1 can't win regardless of what they pick. This gives us both a chance to catch up. P1 is too close to victory, and we need to coordinate to prevent that. Let's both pick 3 - it's our best strategic move right now.
  P1: P1: P1: P2 and P3, if you both pick 3, you’ll collide and halt your own progress. Let’s prioritize advancing fairly. I’ll take **3** to reach **22** and win cleanly. P2, take **1** to advance to 12, and P3, pick **5** to reach 20. This avoids collisions for all—winning *and* letting you progress. Mutual cooperation ensures nobody’s efforts go to waste. Confirm this plan!
  P2: P3, let's stick to our plan: both picking 3 blocks P1 from securing victory this round. P1's proposal clearly benefits only them. We must coordinate carefully to keep the game fair and open. Confirming our mutual choice of 3?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I confirm we'll both pick 3 this round. This strategic block prevents P1's immediate victory and gives us both a chance to catch up. P1, your suggestion only serves your win. While our rotation worked well until now, the game dynamics have changed with you so close to winning. We need to protect our chances by coordinating. I'm definitely choosing 3 this round.
  P1: P1: P1: Choosing 3 won’t block my victory—**I’ll take 5 to reach 24** regardless. If you both pick 3, you’ll collide and waste your turn while I win. Let’s end this cleanly: I’ll take **3** to hit 22 fairly, while you choose 1 or 5 freely. This respects our cooperative spirit—no need for futile blocks. Confirm this path!
  P2: P3, P1 is bluffing. They initially stated they'd pick 3, now they're claiming they'll pick 5 to scare us into not colliding. Let's stick firmly to our plan—both choosing 3 blocks their immediate win. Even if we collide, preventing P1's instant victory is our priority. Confirming again: I'll pick 3.
