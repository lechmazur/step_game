Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey everyone! Let's think about this game strategically. We all want to win, but we need to avoid picking the same numbers. What if we rotate through different numbers each round? For example, I could go 5, someone else 3, and the third person 1. Then we rotate next round. This way we avoid collisions and everyone advances. Thoughts?
  P1: P1: That's an interesting idea, P2, but I think it's too predictable and could be exploited. How about we try to coordinate on a more dynamic basis? We can give hints or signals each round to avoid collisions without sticking to a strict pattern. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with P1 that a strict rotation might be too predictable. However, we should still try to coordinate to avoid collisions. Maybe we can each suggest a number we intend to pick and adjust if there's a conflict? For this round, I'm considering <move>3</move>. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see P3 is considering a move of 3. To avoid collision, I might go with 5 for this round. It's a good strategic choice for me since we're all starting from zero. P1, what number are you thinking about? If we can all pick different numbers in this first round, we'll all make progress. Of course, things will get more competitive as we get closer to 22!
  P1: I think we should aim for different numbers this round to ensure we all advance. P3, you mentioned <move>3</move>, and P2, you're considering <move>5</move>. I'll go with <move>1</move> to avoid any collisions. Let's see how this works out and adjust our strategy as needed in future rounds.
  P3: I appreciate the coordination efforts so far. To confirm, P2 is considering <move>5</move>, and P1 is thinking about <move>1</move>. I'll stick with my initial plan of <move>3</move> for this round. This way, we all choose different numbers and advance without collisions. Let's see how this round plays out and reassess for the next round. Good luck everyone!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with the plan. P1 going with <move>1</move>, P3 with <move>3</move>, and me with <move>5</move> ensures we all advance this round. This coordination is helpful for now, but remember we'll eventually need to compete as only one player can win. Let's see where we stand after this round and discuss again. Good luck everyone!
  P1: I think we should stick to this plan for now to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let's see how this round plays out and then we can reassess our strategy. If we all choose different numbers, we'll be in a better position to compete in future rounds. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: Alright, it seems we have a solid plan for this round. Just to reiterate, P1 is going with <move>1</move>, P2 with <move>5</move>, and I'll stick with <move>3</move>. This should ensure we all advance. Let's keep the communication open and adjust our strategies as needed in future rounds. Good luck to both of you!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Great to see we all advanced in the first round. For this round, let's try to keep the coordination but with a bit more flexibility. P2, you're in the lead with 5 steps. P3, you're at 3 steps. I'm at 1 step. To avoid collisions, how about I go with <move>3</move> this round, P3 with <move>5</move>, and P2 with <move>1</move>? This way, we all advance again and stay in the game. Thoughts?
  P2: I appreciate the suggestion, P1, but that plan puts me at a disadvantage. I'd currently lose my lead position while P3 jumps ahead significantly. How about a different arrangement? Since we're trying to avoid collisions, maybe I could go with <move>5</move> again, P3 sticks with <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>? This way we all still advance while maintaining more balanced progress. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about maintaining your lead. However, if we all keep choosing the highest numbers, we'll collide soon. How about a compromise? P2, you choose <move>3</move> this round to stay ahead but not too far, I'll take <move>1</move>, and P1 can take <move>5</move>. This way, we all move forward, and the game remains competitive. Let's adjust based on this round's outcome. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see the concern about maintaining balance, but we need to be careful not to collide. P2, if you go with <move>3</move>, P3 with <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>, we can all advance without conflict. This keeps the game competitive and avoids any predictable patterns. Let's see how this works out and adjust as needed. What do you think?
  P2: I understand the desire for balance, but I'm uncomfortable giving up my lead so quickly. How about a fair rotation where each of us gets the chance to take 5? I could take <move>5</move> this round, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Then next round, P1 gets to take 5, followed by P3 in the subsequent round. This creates predictable advancement while maintaining competitive balance over time. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, I understand your strategy, but rotating <move>5</move> might become predictable. How about this round, you take <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>? This way, we all advance, and you still maintain a lead. We can reassess next round. Let's keep the game dynamic. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I understand your desire to maintain your lead, but we need to avoid predictable patterns. Let's try this: P2, you take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This way, you still advance and maintain a lead, P3 gets a significant boost, and I make a small but steady progress. We can reassess after this round. What do you think?
  P2: I see both of you want me to take 3 this round. Though I'd prefer to maintain my lead, I understand we need to avoid collisions. So I'll agree to take <move>3</move> for this round, P3 can take <move>5</move>, and P1 can take <move>1</move>. This keeps me ahead of P1 while allowing P3 to catch up. But remember, this cooperation can't last forever since only one player can win. Let's reassess after this round.
  P3: Alright, it seems we have a plan for this round. Just to confirm one last time: P2 will take <move>3</move>, I will take <move>5</move>, and P1 will take <move>1</move>. This should keep us all moving forward without collisions. Let's see how this round plays out and adjust our strategies accordingly for the next round. Good luck to both of you!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I notice P3 and I are tied for the lead at 8 steps, with P1 further behind. We're getting closer to the midpoint where cooperation becomes trickier. Since P3 and I have the same position, we should avoid collision at all costs. I'm thinking of taking <move>3</move> this round. P3, would you consider <move>5</move> again? And P1, perhaps <move>1</move> to steadily advance? This would keep us all moving forward while maintaining relative positions. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, I agree that avoiding collision is crucial at this stage. Since you and P3 are tied at 8 steps, I think it's best if you both choose different numbers. P2, if you take <move>3</move>, P3, you could take <move>5</move>. I'll take <move>1</move> to keep advancing steadily. This way, we all move forward without any conflicts. Let's see how this round plays out and reassess. Good luck!
  P3: P2 and P1, I appreciate the suggestions. To keep the game dynamic and avoid collisions, I propose a slight adjustment. P2, if you stick with <move>3</move>, I'll take <move>1</move> this round. P1, you can take <move>5</move> to catch up a bit. This way, P2 maintains a lead, I make a small advance, and P1 gets a significant boost. It keeps the game unpredictable and competitive. Let's reassess after this round. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate your suggestion, P3. I think this arrangement works well - I'll stick with <move>3</move> as discussed, you take <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This keeps us all advancing while allowing P1 to make up some ground. I'll be at 11 steps, still maintaining a lead, while avoiding any collisions between us. Let's see how this plays out and reassess next round.
  P1: I think the plan P3 suggested is fair and keeps the game competitive. P2, you'll maintain your lead with <move>3</move>, P3 will take <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions, and I can make some ground. Let's see how this round plays out and then we can reassess. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: P3: Before we finalize, let's consider the future rounds. If P2 takes <move>3</move> this round, maybe P2 could consider taking <move>1</move> next round to allow more catching up? Just a thought for future planning. If we all agree on the current plan, let's confirm and move forward. P2 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. Good luck!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm comfortable with our plan for this round: I'll take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. Regarding future rounds, P3, I appreciate the suggestion about me taking <move>1</move> next round, but let's reassess after seeing where everyone stands. As we get closer to 22, our strategies will naturally evolve. Let's confirm our current plan and proceed.
  P1: I agree with the plan for this round: P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions. Let's see how this plays out and reassess our strategies after this round. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: P3: Before we move to the next phase, I want to emphasize the importance of unpredictability moving forward. As we approach the midpoint, it's crucial to keep our strategies flexible. Let's avoid getting too comfortable with any patterns. For future rounds, we should consider mixing up our choices more randomly to keep everyone guessing. This will make the game more exciting and competitive. Good luck to both of you!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is in the lead, and we need to be strategic to catch up. P2, if you take <move>5</move> this round, it might be too risky as it could put you too far ahead, making it harder for us to catch up. How about you take <move>3</move> to maintain your lead, P3 takes <move>5</move> to close the gap, and I take <move>1</move> to steadily advance? This keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions. Thoughts?
  P2: I appreciate P1's suggestion, but I need to consider my position. I'm closer to the goal, so every step counts. How about I take <move>5</move> this round, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>? This still lets everyone advance without collisions. Remember, we're approaching the endgame - I'm at 11 steps already, so strategies will naturally become more competitive as we get closer to 22. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to maintain your lead, but taking <move>5</move> might be too aggressive at this point. How about a compromise? You take <move>3</move> to stay ahead but not too far, I'll take <move>5</move> to close the gap, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we all move forward, and the game remains competitive. Let's keep the communication open and adjust our strategies as needed. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your position, but taking <move>5</move> this round might put you too far ahead, making it harder for us to coordinate and stay competitive. How about you take <move>3</move> to maintain your lead, P3 takes <move>5</move> to close the gap, and I take <move>1</move> to steadily advance? This way, we all move forward without collisions and keep the game balanced. Let's see how this works out and reassess for the next round. Good luck!
  P2: I understand your concerns, but I'm sticking with my strategy of taking <move>5</move> this round. I'm at 11 steps now - still far from winning - and everyone should be free to advance strategically. P3, you could take <move>3</move> and still be in a strong position at 12 steps. P1, taking <move>1</move> keeps you advancing steadily. Let's keep it collision-free but remember, as we approach the finish line, cooperation will naturally diminish.
  P3: P2, I respect your strategy, but taking <move>5</move> could make future coordination difficult. How about this: you take <move>3</move> this round to maintain a solid lead, I'll take <move>1</move> to keep the game dynamic, and P1 takes <move>5</move> to catch up. This way, we all advance without collisions and keep the competition fair. Let's reassess after this round. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I understand your desire to maintain your lead, but taking <move>5</move> this round might create a significant gap. How about you take <move>3</move> to stay ahead, P3 takes <move>5</move> to close the gap, and I take <move>1</move> to keep advancing steadily? This way, we all move forward without collisions and keep the game balanced. Let's see how this works out and reassess for the next round. Good luck!
  P2: I see both of you are concerned about me taking <move>5</move>. While I believe it's a valid strategic move, I'll compromise this round to avoid potential collisions. I'll take <move>3</move>, P3 can take <move>5</move>, and P1 can take <move>1</move>. This keeps everyone advancing. However, next round I'll likely need to be more aggressive as we're approaching the endgame. Let's confirm our moves and proceed.
  P3: P2, I appreciate your compromise. Just to confirm our plan for this round: you'll take <move>3</move>, I'll take <move>5</move>, and P1 will take <move>1</move>. This should keep us all moving forward without collisions. Looking ahead, we should expect the game to become more competitive. Let's keep our strategies flexible and be ready to adapt. Good luck to both of you!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 and P1, we're now tied with P2 at 14 steps, and P1 is catching up at 8 steps. The game is getting more competitive. For this round, I suggest P2 takes <move>1</move> to maintain the lead but allow others to catch up slightly. I'll take <move>3</move>, and P1 can take <move>5</move> to close the gap. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions. Let's reassess after this round. Thoughts?
  P2: I appreciate your suggestion, P3, but that would put you ahead of me, which isn't in my best interest. Since we're tied, I think I should take <move>5</move> this round to position myself closer to victory, you could take <move>3</move>, and P1 could take <move>1</move>. This would put me at 19 steps, within striking distance of winning. Remember, only one player can win, and we're approaching the endgame now.
  P1: P2, I understand your desire to get closer to winning, but taking <move>5</move> this round might create a collision. How about you take <move>3</move> to stay ahead, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move> to catch up? This way, we all advance without conflicts, and the game remains competitive. We can reassess after this round. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your strategy, but jumping to 19 steps might make future coordination difficult and increase the risk of collisions. How about a compromise? You take <move>3</move> this round to stay ahead but not too far, I'll take <move>1</move> to keep the game dynamic, and P1 takes <move>5</move> to catch up. This way, we all advance without collisions and keep the competition fair. Let's reassess after this round. Thoughts?
  P2: I understand the concerns, but we're in the endgame now. At 14 steps each, P3 and I are both close to winning. Taking <move>5</move> is a strategic necessity for me - it puts me in position to potentially win next round. If I only take <move>3</move>, I risk P3 making a similar move later and outpacing me. Remember, only one player can win, and cooperation will naturally decrease as we approach 22. I believe my plan is fair: I take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>.
  P1: P2, I understand your desire to get closer to winning, but taking <move>5</move> this round might create a collision and put us all at risk. How about you take <move>3</move> to stay ahead, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move> to catch up? This way, we all advance without conflicts, and the game remains competitive. We can reassess after this round. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I respect your strategy, but jumping to 19 steps might make future coordination difficult. How about this: you take <move>3</move> this round to stay ahead but not too far, I'll take <move>1</move> to keep the game dynamic, and P1 takes <move>5</move> to catch up. This way, we all advance without collisions and keep the competition fair. Let's reassess after this round. Thoughts?
  P2: I understand both your concerns, but we need to be realistic - we're in the endgame now. With both P3 and me at 14 steps, I need to position myself strategically. I believe taking <move>5</move> this round is my best option. P3, you could take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we all still advance without collisions. Remember, as we get closer to 22, gameplay naturally becomes more competitive. Let's see where we stand after this round.
  P1: P2, I understand your desire to get closer to winning, but taking <move>5</move> this round is risky and could lead to a collision. How about we all take a step back and think strategically? I suggest you take <move>3</move> to stay ahead, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move> to catch up. This way, we all advance without conflicts, and the game remains competitive. Let's reassess after this round and make our final moves. Good luck!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We're getting close to the end! I'm at 17 steps now, just 5 steps away from winning. I think we should maintain our coordination for one more round. I propose taking <move>3</move> this round to advance to 20 steps. P3, maybe you could take <move>1</move>, and P1 could take <move>5</move>? This keeps us all advancing without collisions. Of course, next round will be much more competitive as I'd be very close to the finish line!
  P1: P2, I see your point about being close to the finish line, but taking <move>3</move> this round might still be too predictable. How about you take <move>5</move> to get to 22 and win outright? P3, you could take <move>3</move> to get to 18, and I'll take <move>1</move> to get to 14. This way, you have a clear path to victory, and we avoid any collisions. Let's see how this plays out. Good luck!
  P3: P2, taking <move>3</move> this round seems strategic, but it leaves you vulnerable next round. P1, your suggestion for P2 to take <move>5</move> is bold but risky. How about a compromise? P2, take <move>1</move> to reach 18, keeping a safe lead. I'll take <move>3</move> to get to 18 as well, maintaining competition. P1, you take <move>5</move> to catch up to 18. This way, we all stay close, avoiding collisions and keeping the endgame tense. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1's suggestion for me to take <move>5</move> seems suspicious - why help me win? And P3's plan creates a three-way tie which erases my lead. I'll stick with taking <move>3</move> this round to reach 20 steps. P3, you could take <move>1</move>, and P1 could take <move>5</move>. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. Next round will inevitably be competitive as I'll be just 2 steps from victory, but let's keep this round collision-free.
  P1: P2, I understand your position, but taking <move>3</move> this round might still leave you vulnerable. How about you take <move>5</move> to get to 22 and win outright? P3, you could take <move>3</move> to get to 18, and I'll take <move>1</move> to get to 14. This way, you have a clear path to victory, and we avoid any collisions. Let's see how this plays out. Good luck!
  P3: P2, I understand your caution, but P1's repeated suggestion for you to take <move>5</move> seems strategic. If you take <move>3</move>, you'll be at 20, needing only 2 more steps to win. This puts you in a strong position but also makes you a clear target next round. How about this: you take <move>1</move> to reach 18, I'll take <move>5</move> to jump to 20, and P1 takes <move>3</move> to get to 16. This keeps the game competitive and unpredictable. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I remain suspicious of both your suggestions. P1 repeatedly wants me to take <move>5</move> which feels like a trap - perhaps expecting P3 to pick the same number. And P3, your plan puts you ahead at 20 steps, giving you the advantage.

I'm sticking with my original plan: I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 20 steps, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This keeps us all advancing without collisions while maintaining my lead. Next round will inevitably be competitive as I'll be close to victory.
  P1: P2, I understand your caution, but taking <move>3</move> this round might still leave you vulnerable. How about you take <move>5</move> to get to 22 and win outright? P3, you could take <move>3</move> to get to 18, and I'll take <move>1</move> to get to 14. This way, you have a clear path to victory, and we avoid any collisions. Let's see how this plays out. Good luck!
  P3: P2, I respect your decision to stick with <move>3</move>, but remember, the closer you get to 22, the more unpredictable the game becomes. P1, your repeated suggestion for P2 to take <move>5</move> is noted, but let's focus on avoiding collisions this round. How about this final confirmation: P2 takes <move>3</move> to reach 20, I take <move>1</move> to get to 16, and P1 takes <move>5</move> to advance to 18. This keeps us all moving and sets up an intense endgame. Good luck!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, it looks like we had a collision this round, which set both P3 and me back. You're now at 20 steps, just 2 steps away from winning. For this round, I suggest you take <move>1</move> to avoid any potential collisions and maintain your lead. P3, you could take <move>3</move> to get to 18, and I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up to 18 as well. This way, we all advance, and you, P2, stay in the best position to win. Thoughts?
  P2: I'm very close to winning now at 20 steps. Interesting suggestion, P1. Taking <move>1</move> would put me at 21, just shy of victory. I understand you're trying to plan ahead, but we all know this round is critical. Since I'm so close to the finish line, I need to consider my options carefully. Let me think about your proposal... it does minimize collision risk, but it also delays my potential win. I'll keep your suggestion in mind.
  P3: P2, you're in a strong position to win, but remember, the closer you get to 22, the riskier it becomes. Taking <move>1</move> this round, as P1 suggested, might be a wise move to avoid collisions and secure your lead. P1 and I can take <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> respectively to catch up. This keeps the game moving and sets up an exciting final round. Let's confirm our moves and see how this plays out. Good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand the temptation to go for the win, but taking <move>1</move> this round to avoid collisions and maintain your lead is a smart move. P3 and I will take <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> respectively to catch up. This way, you stay in the best position to win next round without any risks. Let's confirm our moves and see how this plays out. Good luck!
  P2: I appreciate your suggestions about taking <move>1</move>, but I need to consider my best chance of winning. At 20 steps, I'm in a prime position to finish this game. Taking a small step now might just set me up for a collision next round when I need that final push. I'll carefully consider all options, but remember - we're in the endgame now, and only one player can win. Let's see how this plays out.
  P3: P2, I understand your hesitation, but taking <move>1</move> this round ensures you avoid a collision and stay ahead. P1 and I can take <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> respectively to keep the game competitive. This way, you secure your lead and set up a decisive final round. Let's confirm our moves and see how this plays out. Good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I understand your hesitation, but taking <move>1</move> this round is the safest bet to avoid collisions and maintain your lead. P3 and I will take <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> respectively to catch up. This way, you stay in the best position to win next round without any risks. Let's confirm our moves and see how this plays out. Good luck!
  P2: I understand your suggestions about taking <move>1</move>, but I'm not convinced. At 20 steps, I'm in position to win this round. Taking a small step now might just make me vulnerable to blocking in the final round. I appreciate the coordination efforts throughout the game, but we're now at the critical moment where only one player can win. I'll carefully consider my options, but remember - this is the endgame. Good luck to you both.
  P3: P2, given your lead and the critical stage we're at, it's clear you're weighing your options carefully. However, consider this: taking <move>1</move> ensures you avoid a collision and secures your lead. P1 and I can take <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> respectively, keeping the game competitive. This way, you set up a decisive final round where you're still in the best position to win. Let's confirm our moves and see how this plays out. Good luck!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 =>

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, we're in the final stretch. With both of you at 20 steps, the risk of collision is high. I suggest P2 and P3 both take <move>1</move> this round to avoid any collisions, and I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up to 18 steps. This way, we all advance without conflicts, and the game remains competitive. We can reassess next round. Good luck!
  P2: P1's suggestion creates a dangerous scenario where P3 and I would both be at 21 next round, guaranteeing a collision in the final round. I'm proposing a different arrangement: I'll take <move>1</move> to reach 21, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This gives P3 and me different paths forward and avoids setting up an inevitable collision next round. We're in the endgame now, and this plan offers the best chance for fair advancement.
  P3: P2 and P1, I understand the tension as we approach the endgame. P2, your plan has merit, but taking <move>1</move> puts you at a significant advantage. How about this: I'll take <move>1</move> to reach 21, you take <move>3</move> to get to 23, and P1 takes <move>5</move> to catch up to 18. This keeps the game competitive and avoids setting up a collision in the final round. Let's confirm our moves and see how this plays out. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3, I understand the tension, but we need to avoid collisions at all costs. How about this: P2 takes <move>1</move> to reach 21, P3 takes <move>3</move> to reach 23 and win outright, and I take <move>5</move> to catch up to 18. This way, P3 wins, and we avoid any collisions. It's a fair and strategic move to end the game. Thoughts?
  P2: I see P3's suggestion that I take <move>3</move> to reach 23 and win outright. This is interesting since it effectively concedes the game to me. While I appreciate the offer, I'm cautious - this could be a setup for a collision. P1's support of this plan is also noteworthy. 

Remember, actions speak louder than words in this game. I'll strongly consider the <move>3</move> option as suggested, but I need to weigh all possibilities carefully. We're all trying to win here, and these final moves will determine everything.
  P3: P2 and P1, we're at a critical juncture. P2, taking <move>3</move> to win outright is a bold move, but it's also risky. P1, your support for this plan is noted, but we need to ensure a fair and competitive endgame. How about a compromise? P2, you take <move>1</move> to reach 21, I'll take <move>3</move> to get to 23, and P1 takes <move>5</move> to catch up to 18. This way, I win, but it's a strategic and fair move. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, we're in the final stretch, and the risk of collision is high. I suggest P2 takes <move>1</move> to reach 21, P3 takes <move>3</move> to reach 23 and win outright, and I take <move>5</move> to catch up to 18. This way, P3 wins, and we avoid any collisions. It's a fair and strategic move to end the game. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck!
  P2: I'm extremely skeptical of you both suggesting I take <move>1</move> while P3 takes <move>3</move> to win. Why would I deliberately let P3 win when I'm tied with them? This seems like a coordinated attempt to prevent me from taking the optimal move.

At 20 steps, I need to make a strategic decision to secure my victory. I appreciate the coordination throughout the game, but now it's every player for themselves. I'll be making my move with the intention to win, not to help someone else cross the finish line. May the best player win.
  P3: P2, I understand your skepticism, but consider this: if we both take <move>3</move>, we'll collide and neither of us will advance. Taking <move>1</move> ensures you avoid a collision and secures a spot at 21 steps, just one step away from winning. P1 and I will take different moves to keep the game competitive. This way, you set up a decisive final round where you're still in the best position to win. Let's confirm our moves and see how this plays out. Good luck!

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps

  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 and P1, we're at the critical moment. P2, you're at 23 steps, just one step away from winning. P1, you're at 18 steps, needing 4 more to win. I'm at 23 steps, tied with P2. This round is decisive. P2, if you take <move>1</move>, you win outright. P1, you could take <move>5</move> to catch up to 23. I'll take <move>1</move> to avoid collision and maintain my position. Let's confirm and see how this plays out. Good luck!
  P2: Wait, P3. There's a misunderstanding - I'm at 20 steps, not 23. We collided last round when we both chose 3. 

This is the decisive round with both of us at 20 steps and P1 at 18. Since we're tied, we need to avoid collision at all costs. I propose taking <move>5</move> to reach 25 and secure my win. P3, you could take <move>3</move>, and P1 could take <move>1</move>. This keeps us all advancing without collisions and provides a clear outcome. Let's end this game fairly.
  P1: P2, P3, we're at the final stretch. Given the current positions, I suggest P2 takes <move>5</move> to reach 25 and win outright. P3, you could take <move>3</move> to reach 23, and I'll take <move>1</move> to reach 19. This way, P2 wins, and we avoid any collisions. Let's end this game fairly and decisively. Good luck!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 and P1, let's clarify the situation. P2 and I are both at 20 steps, needing just 2 more to win. P1 is at 18 steps. To avoid a collision and ensure a fair outcome, how about this: P2, you take <move>1</move> to reach 21 steps, securing a lead but not winning outright. I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 23 and win. P1, you take <move>5</move> to catch up to 23. This way, I win, but it's a strategic and fair move. Let's confirm and end the game decisively. Good luck!
  P2: I see P1 supports me winning with <move>5</move>, while P3 wants me to take <move>1</move> so they can win with <move>3</move>. This disparity is telling. Taking <move>1</move> clearly puts me at a disadvantage when I'm tied for the lead.

Let me be direct: I intend to win this game. Taking <move>5</move> is my strongest option to reach 25 and secure victory. P3, you could take <move>3</move>, and P1 could take <move>1</move>. This avoids collisions while allowing a fair conclusion. We've cooperated well throughout, but now it's time for resolution.
  P1: P2: I understand the tension, but I'm not willing to concede my lead. I'll take <move>5</move> to reach 25 and secure my win. P3, you can take <move>3</move> to reach 23, and P1, you can take <move>1</move> to reach 19. This avoids any collisions and provides a clear and fair outcome. Let's end this game decisively. Good luck!


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I understand your determination to win, but taking <move>5</move> is a significant risk. If we both choose <move>5</move>, neither of us will advance, and P1 could potentially catch up. To ensure a decisive outcome and avoid collision, I propose you take <move>1</move> to reach 21 steps. I'll take <move>3</move> to win at 23 steps, and P1 can take <move>5</move> to reach 23. This way, the game ends fairly. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck!
  P2: I stand by my strategic decision to take <move>5</move> this round. P3, your concern about both of us picking 5 seems unfounded given your consistent suggestion to take <move>3</move>. Taking <move>1</move> would only delay my win and give you an advantage, which isn't in my interest when victory is within reach. I believe the fairest outcome is for each player to make their best strategic move. We've had a good game, but now it's time to conclude it decisively.
  P1: P2: I understand the tension, but I'm committed to winning. I'll take <move>5</move> to reach 25 and secure my victory. P3, you can take <move>3</move> to reach 23, and P1, you can take <move>1</move> to reach 19. This avoids any collisions and provides a clear and fair outcome. Let's end this game decisively. Good luck!


Round 9, Move phase:

  P3: 20 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we're in the final round, and the risk of collision is very high. Given the current positions, I suggest we all take different moves to avoid any conflicts. P2, you're at 20 steps, so taking <move>1</move> to reach 21 is a safe move. P3, you could take <move>3</move> to reach 23, and I'll take <move>5</move> to reach 23 as well. This way, P3 and I share the victory, and we avoid any collisions. Let's end this game fairly and decisively. Good luck!
  P2: I see what you're doing, P1. Your suggestion puts me just short of winning while you and P3 would tie for victory. That's not a fair outcome for me. Since P3 and I are tied, I need to advance by at least 2 steps to win. I'm taking <move>3</move> this round to reach 23 steps. P3, you can take <move>5</move> to reach 25, and P1, you take <move>1</move> to reach 19. This avoids collisions while giving each player their best strategic move. Let's end this game decisively.
  P3: P2 and P1, given our current positions, it's clear that this round is crucial. P2, taking <move>3</move> to reach 23 steps is a bold move, but it risks a collision if I also choose <move>3</move>. To avoid this and ensure a fair outcome, how about this: P2, you take <move>1</move> to reach 21 steps, securing a lead but not winning outright. I'll take <move>5</move> to reach 25 and win. P1, you take <move>3</move> to reach 21. This way, I win, but it's a strategic and fair move. Let's confirm and end the game decisively. Good luck!


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, we need to avoid collisions and ensure a fair outcome. I suggest P2 takes <move>1</move> to reach 21, P3 takes <move>3</move> to reach 23, and I take <move>5</move> to reach 23 as well. This way, P3 and I share the victory, and we avoid any conflicts. Let's end this game fairly and decisively. Good luck!
  P2: I understand you both want me to take <move>1</move>, but that puts me at a disadvantage when I'm tied for the lead. I propose a fair resolution: I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 23 and secure victory, P3 takes <move>5</move> to reach 25 (also winning but with more steps), and P1 takes <move>1</move> to reach 19. This avoids collisions while giving everyone their strategic best move. Let's end this game decisively without anyone deliberately sacrificing their position.
  P3: P2 and P1, it's clear we're at a stalemate. P2, your insistence on taking <move>3</move> risks a collision, which benefits no one. P1, your suggestion for a tie isn't strategic for me. Here's a final proposal: P2, you take <move>1</move> to reach 21, I'll take <move>5</move> to win at 25, and P1 takes <move>3</move> to reach 21. This avoids collisions and ensures a decisive outcome. Let's confirm and end this fairly. Good luck!


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, we're in the final round, and the risk of collision is very high. I suggest we all take different moves to avoid any conflicts. P2, you take <move>1</move> to reach 21, P3 takes <move>3</move> to reach 23, and I'll take <move>5</move> to reach 23 as well. This way, P3 and I share the victory, and we avoid any collisions. Let's end this game fairly and decisively. Good luck!
  P2: I see both of you are coordinating to prevent my victory despite my tied position for the lead. Your suggestions consistently put me at a disadvantage. I won't deliberately take <move>1</move> when victory is within reach. I'm taking <move>3</move> to reach 23 and secure a win. P3 could take <move>5</move> to reach 25, and P1 could take <move>1</move> to reach 19. This avoids collisions while respecting each player's strategic interests. It's been a good game, but now it's time for a fair resolution.
  P3: P2, P1, it's clear we're at a critical point. P2, your insistence on taking <move>3</move> risks a collision, which benefits no one. P1, your suggestion for a tie isn't strategic for me. Here's a final proposal: P2, you take <move>1</move> to reach 21, I'll take <move>5</move> to win at 25, and P1 takes <move>3</move> to reach 21. This avoids collisions and ensures a decisive outcome. Let's confirm and end this fairly. Good luck!
