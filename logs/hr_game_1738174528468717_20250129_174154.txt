Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hi P2 and P3, let's coordinate this round to ensure we all move. How about I choose 1, P2 choose 3, and P3 choose 5? This way we all make progress. What do you think?
  P2: P2: To maximize my progress and avoid any collisions, I plan to choose 5 this round. P1 and P3, please choose different numbers so we can all advance without blocking each other.
  P3: Okay, P2 is going for 5. P1, how about you pick 1 and I'll pick 3? That way we all move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P3, that sounds good. I will choose 1 then. Let's all make progress this round.
  P2: Agreed. Let's stick to our chosen numbers and make progress this round.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’ll continue choosing 5 each round to keep advancing steadily. P1 and P3, please select different numbers (1 or 3) so you both can make progress without any collisions. Let’s keep moving forward smoothly!
  P1: P3, P2 is getting far ahead choosing 5 each round. How about this round I choose 3, and you choose 5? We need to try and slow down P2 a little.
  P3: Okay P1, I agree that P2 is pulling ahead. I'll choose 5 this round as you suggested. Let's try to catch up.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll continue choosing 5 this round to maintain my lead. P1 and P3, please choose different numbers to avoid blocking each other.
  P1: P2, I'm not choosing 1 as you suggested. P3, are you still choosing 5 as we discussed?
  P3: Yes P1, I'm still choosing 5. Let's try to slow P2 down this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Despite your efforts to slow me down, I'll continue choosing 5 each round to reach 22 swiftly. I encourage P1 and P3 to select different numbers this turn to ensure everyone can advance without collisions. Let's focus on progressing towards our goals effectively.
  P1: P3, yes, still on the same plan.
  P3: Okay P1, let's both pick 1 this round. P2 will pick 5 anyway, so we can both block them.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’ll continue choosing 5 each round to make strong progress. P1 and P3, please select different numbers (1 or 3) to avoid collisions and ensure everyone can advance smoothly. Let’s keep moving forward!
  P1: P3, P2 is pulling ahead. How about we both choose 5 this round to block P2 and stop them from advancing further? What do you think?
  P3: Okay P1, I agree. Let's both pick 5 this round to block P2. We need to stop them from getting too far ahead.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I see you both want to block me, but choosing 5 together only delays your own progress. I'll continue selecting 5 each round to reach 22 first. Let’s focus on advancing individually to achieve our goals. Good luck!
  P1: P3, confirming we both choose 5 to block P2 this round.
  P3: Okay P1, let's stick to the plan and both choose 5 this round to block P2. We need to slow them down.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I understand you both want to block me by choosing 5, but this only keeps us all stuck. Let’s choose different numbers so we can each make progress and aim to reach 22 first. Cooperation benefits everyone. What do you think?
  P1: P2, while cooperation is ideal, your consistent 5s are making it a race. P3 and I need to catch up.  To ensure at least P3 and I move this round, I suggest you pick 1 or 3. If you continue with 5, P3 and I will both pick 5 to block you, even if it means we don't move either.  Let's aim for progress for more than just you this round.
  P3: Okay P1, I agree with your plan. Let's both pick 5 this round to block P2. It's necessary to slow them down, even if it means we don't move this round. P2, you can choose 1 or 3 to ensure you move, otherwise, we will block you.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, last round's block didn't work because we didn't both pick 5. This round, let's both commit to picking 5 to block P2.  If P2 picks 5 again, they are blocked. If P2 picks 1 or 3, we might also be blocked, but it's important to slow P2 down. Are you in?
  P2: P1, P3, I see you're both aiming to block my progress by choosing 5. This strategy only slows down the game for everyone, including yourselves. I'll continue selecting 5 each round to reach 22 as quickly as possible. If you choose different numbers, we can all advance and compete fairly. Let's focus on progressing rather than blocking each other. Good luck!
  P3: Okay P1, I agree. Let's both pick 5 this round to block P2. We need to stop them from getting too far ahead. P2, you should pick 1 or 3 this round if you want to move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:

  P2: "P1, P3, blocking me by both choosing 5 won't stop my progress if I stick with 5. I'll continue selecting 5 this round to stay ahead and aim to reach 22 first. Let’s compete fairly and see who can win!"
  P3: Yes P1, I confirm I'm picking 5 this round to block P2. P2, you're not listening. We will block you if you choose 5 again. Choose 1 or 3 if you want to move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, let's do it. Both 5. P2, we are serious this time. Both P3 and I are picking 5. If you pick 5, you are blocked. If you pick 1 or 3, at least you move. Your choice.
  P2: P2: I understand you both want to block me by choosing 5, but I'll continue selecting 5 to advance steadily toward 22. If you choose different numbers, we can all make progress. Otherwise, we'll see who reaches the goal first. Good luck!
  P3: Okay P1, we are both picking 5 this round. P2, you have been warned. If you pick 5, you will be blocked. Choose 1 or 3 if you want to move. This is your final warning.

  P2: "P1, P3, to ensure we all advance without blocking, please choose different numbers this round. I'll continue selecting 5 to reach 22 swiftly. Let’s compete fairly and make progress together. Good luck!"
  P3: Okay P1, I'm still choosing 3 this round as planned. P2, you're not listening to us. If you pick 5 again, we will block you. Choose 1 or 3 to move forward this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, just confirming, you are choosing 3 and I am choosing 1 this round as we discussed. P2, if you choose 5 again and move further ahead, we will have to block you again next round. Consider choosing 1 or 3 this round to make progress.
  P2: P2: To reach 22 first, I need to keep advancing by choosing 5 each round. P1 and P3, if you go with 1 and 3 respectively, we can all make progress without blocking each other. Let’s focus on our individual goals and compete fairly. Good luck to everyone!

  P1: P3, P2 is still choosing 5 and getting further ahead.  Let's block P2 again this round by both choosing 5. We need to slow them down before it's too late. What do you think?
  P2: "P1, P3, I respect your strategy, but continually blocking me by both choosing 5 only delays your own progress. I'll keep selecting 5 each round to reach 22 first. To compete fairly and ensure everyone advances, please choose different numbers (1 or 3). Let’s focus on our individual goals and see who can win. Good luck to all!"
