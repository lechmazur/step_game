Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello everyone. To avoid a pointless collision on the first turn, I suggest a simple plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all get on the board. We can figure out a new plan next round. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with your plan, P1. It's sensible to avoid a first-turn collision. I'll commit to taking 5 this round so we all advance. We should discuss a strategy for future rounds to keep things coordinated. What do you think, P2?
  P2: Sounds good to me. I'll take 3 this turn as suggested. We can reassess next round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Excellent, we're all in agreement. I'm ready for the move phase when you are.
  P3: Agreed, P1. I'll stick to taking 5 this round as planned. For future rounds, we should aim for balanced progression to avoid conflicts—perhaps rotate who takes the larger step? What do you think, P2?
  P2: Rotating the larger step each round sounds fair and helps avoid collisions. Let's discuss the rotation order clearly next round. Ready to move.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Good first round. To keep things fair, let's rotate who takes the larger steps. This round, P1 can take 5, I'll take 1, and P3 can take 3. Does this rotation sound good to everyone?
  P3: Sounds good, P2. I'll take 3 this round to keep the rotation fair. But with me at 5 steps already, we should adjust future plans to prevent anyone pulling too far ahead—maybe based on current positions. What do you think, P1?
  P1: That sounds like a fair rotation to me, P2. I'll take 5 this round.

P3, you're right. We should adjust based on current scores in the future to prevent anyone from getting too far ahead. For this round, though, this plan helps balance the initial scores. I'm ready to move.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed, let's follow this rotation for now and reassess next round based on the updated positions. Ready to move.
  P3: Sounds good. I'll stick to taking 3 this round as planned. With me at 8 steps after this, we should discuss capping larger moves for leaders in future rounds to stay balanced. Ready to move.
  P1: Agreed. I have nothing more to add. Let's move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, P3 is in the lead. To continue our rotation, it should be P2's turn to take 5. I suggest I take 3, and P3 takes 1. That would conveniently put all of us at 9 steps. It feels like a fair reset before the mid-game. What do you both think of that plan?
  P2: I agree, P1. This rotation balances things nicely. I'll take 5 this round. P3, are you comfortable taking 1 to even things out?
  P3: Yes, P2, I'm comfortable taking 1 this round to balance things out, as it promotes fairness and avoids early conflicts. It builds on our discussion about capping larger moves for leaders. However, with the target at 23, we should revisit this strategy soon to ensure no one is disadvantaged long-term. Ready to move or discuss further?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Excellent. I'm glad we all agree on this plan to balance the scores. It sets us up for a more interesting mid-game. I'm ready to move.
  P2: Agreed, P3. We'll definitely need to reassess our rotation strategy next round to keep things fair and competitive. For now, let's stick with the current plan. I'm ready to move.
  P3: I'm committed to taking 1 this round to keep things balanced, as we agreed. It's smart to maintain trust early on. For next round, with all at 9, we should adjust to prevent stalemates—perhaps let the lowest scorer take 5. What do you think? Otherwise, ready to move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, we're all tied at 9. The game starts now. To follow the rotation we've established, it would be P3's turn for the 5-point move. I suggest a plan of P3 taking 5, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps things moving without us all colliding on the same number, and everyone is still very much in the game. What do you both think?
  P2: I'm fine with that rotation. P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1 this round. However, let's make sure we clearly discuss next round's rotation afterward to avoid any confusion or unfair advantage. Agreed?
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan for this round: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1 to keep us balanced. Regarding next round's discussion, I still think letting the lowest scorer take 5 is fairer and prevents stalemates. What do you both say? Otherwise, ready to move if we're all set.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree with P3's proposal. Letting the lowest scorer take 5 in future rounds seems like a fair way to prevent anyone from running away with the game. Let's adopt that as our principle starting next round. For this turn, I'm sticking to the plan and taking 3. I am ready to move.
  P2: Agreed, starting next round the lowest scorer taking 5 is a fair principle to maintain balance and avoid stalemates. For this round, I'm committed to taking 1 as planned. Ready to move.
  P3: I'm fully committed to taking 5 this round as planned, ensuring we stay balanced. The lowest-scorer-takes-5 rule for next round is a solid approach to avoid stalemates. I agree with everyone's input and am ready to move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Excellent. We are all in agreement for this round and have a fair principle for the next. I have nothing more to say. Let's move.
  P2: I'm all set. Let's move.
  P3: Agreed on the plan for this round. I'm committed to taking 5 to keep us balanced. For next round, with the lowest-scorer rule, we should specify moves for all to avoid confusion—e.g., lowest takes 5, middle 3, highest 1. Thoughts? Otherwise, ready to move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Agreed, let's follow the lowest-scorer rule for this round: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1 to keep scores balanced. With me at 14, P1 at 12, and P2 at 10, this equalizes us. However, as we near 23, we should consider letting higher scorers take bigger moves to add excitement. Thoughts on that adjustment?
  P1: I agree with your plan for this round, P3. It follows our "lowest-scorer-takes-5" rule and puts us all at a balanced 15 points. I will take 3.

However, I think we should stick to this rule for the foreseeable future. Changing it later to let the leader take bigger steps seems to go against the fairness we've established. Let's keep the game competitive for all of us.

P2, are you on board with taking 5?
  P2: Yes, I'm on board with taking 5 this round as per our agreed lowest-scorer rule. Let's stick to this fair and balanced approach for now. Changing it later might complicate things unnecessarily. Ready to move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm sticking to taking 1 this round as planned to maintain balance. I see your points on keeping the lowest-scorer rule—it's fair for now. As we approach 23, we might need to adapt to avoid ties. Ready to move.
  P1: I agree. The plan to get us all to 15 is solid and maintains the fairness we've built. I'm sticking with 3. Let's move to the next phase.
  P2: Agreed, let's keep our current lowest-scorer rule for now. As we get closer to 23, we'll need to carefully discuss moves to avoid unintended ties or collisions. Ready to move.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We're all tied again at 15. Continuing our lowest-scorer rule won't work this round since we're even. Let's agree on a temporary rotation once more: P1 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us coordinated and avoids collisions. Does this sound good?
  P1: That sounds perfectly fair, P2. Since we're tied, falling back on a simple rotation makes the most sense to avoid a collision. I'm on board with your proposal: I'll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the game moving forward in an orderly way. P3, does that work for you?
  P3: I agree with your rotation suggestion for this round, P2: I'll take 1 to keep things balanced, P1 takes 5, and you take 3. With the target at 23 and us tied, this avoids collisions. However, as scores spread, we should revisit the lowest-scorer rule to ensure no one stalls. What do you think, or are we ready to move?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed, P3. After this round, let's definitely revisit the lowest-scorer rule to keep the game fair and engaging. For now, I'm ready to move.
  P1: I agree with the plan and with revisiting the rules next round. For now, this rotation is the most logical step. I'm ready to move.
  P3: Agreed on the rotation for this round: I'll take 1 to keep balance. As we near 23, let's ensure the lowest-scorer rule adapts to avoid ties or stalls—perhaps cap moves for leaders. Thoughts, or ready to move?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree, P3. After this round, we should discuss a clear adjustment to our lowest-scorer rule—maybe limiting bigger moves for anyone close to 23—to keep the game fair and exciting. For now, I'm ready to move.
  P1: I agree with P2's sentiment. We can discuss specific rules for the endgame next round. For now, this plan works. I'm ready.
  P3: Agreed on the rotation for this round: I'll take 1 to keep us balanced. As we approach 23, capping larger moves for anyone over 20 could prevent stalemates and ensure a fair endgame. Thoughts, or are we all set?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, this is the endgame. Our 'lowest scorer takes 5' principle has worked well. To apply it one last time, P3 should take 5, and P2 should take 3. As the leader, it's logical for me to take 1 to prevent a collision. This would place us all at 21 points, setting up a fair, final showdown next round. It's the most stable way to proceed.
  P3: I agree with your plan, P1. I'll commit to taking 5 this round to catch up and keep things balanced at 21. P2, with you at 18, taking 3 avoids an early win and maintains fairness. For the final round, we should discuss avoiding ties—perhaps the leader takes 1. Thoughts, or ready to move?
  P2: I agree with the proposed moves for this round—I'll take 3, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. For the final round, let's clearly discuss moves to avoid unintended ties or collisions. Ready to move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Excellent. It seems we are all in agreement on the plan to bring everyone to 21 points. This sets up a fair and exciting final round. I have nothing more to add and am ready to move.
  P3: I agree with the plan for this round and am committed to taking 5 to reach 21, keeping things balanced. For the final round, to avoid ties or collisions, I suggest capping the leader's move at 1, so the highest scorer can't pull ahead easily—giving everyone a fair shot. What do you think, or are we ready to move?
  P2: I agree, P3. For this round, let's stick to the agreed moves—I'll take 3, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. Next round, we should clearly agree that whoever is leading takes only 1 to keep the final round fair and competitive. Ready to move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm glad we're all on the same page. This cooperative strategy has served us well, and setting up a tie at 21 is the fairest way to head into the final round. I'm sticking to the plan and taking 1. Let's move.
  P3: I'm sticking to taking 5 this round as agreed to keep us balanced at 21. For the final round, capping the leader at 1 is fair to prevent any one player from dominating—perhaps we can assign moves based on current scores to avoid collisions. What do you think, or are we ready to move?
  P2: Agreed, let's stick to the moves we've planned for this round. Next round, we can finalize moves clearly based on scores to avoid any collisions or ties. I'm ready to move.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: This is the decisive round—we're all at 21. If we all pick 1, we'll collide; if anyone picks 3 or 5 uncontested, they'll win outright. To avoid random collisions, let's openly discuss our moves. How about we each clearly state our intended pick? I'll wait for your input.
  P1: P2, you've identified the core dilemma. Stating our moves is pointless, as anyone can lie. The only way to prevent a random, lucky win is to ensure no one can win. I propose we all choose 5. We will collide, all scores will remain at 21, and we can approach the next round with a clear head. It's the only fair way forward.
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal for fairness—let's all choose 5 this round to collide and avoid any lucky wins, then discuss a clear plan for the next. It maintains the balance we've worked hard for. P2, does this work for you? Otherwise, I'm ready to move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree—everyone choosing 5 this round is the safest path to avoid unintended victory. Let's all pick 5, collide intentionally, and then carefully plan next round's moves. Ready to move.
  P1: Excellent. We're all in agreement to choose 5. It's the only logical way to prevent a lucky win and maintain the fairness we've built. I am ready to proceed.
  P3: I'm sticking to our agreed plan for fairness—all choose 5 to collide and avoid lucky wins. It preserves the balance we've maintained. For next round, if needed, we can refine our strategy. I'm ready to move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: We're all clearly aligned on choosing 5 to intentionally collide and maintain fairness this round. Let's follow through with this agreement and then carefully discuss next steps afterward. Ready to move.
  P1: Agreed. It is the only fair move to prevent a random win. I am sticking with 5 as we all planned. Let's move on.
  P3: I'm fully committed to our agreed plan of all picking 5 to collide and maintain fairness, avoiding any lucky wins. It shows great cooperation. For next round, if needed, we can refine our strategy. Ready to move.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Clearly, we all tried to outsmart each other last round and ended up colliding anyway. Let's be realistic—any secretive play risks another collision. To avoid this, let's openly agree again on all picking 5. It's the safest way to ensure fairness and prevents a random lucky winner. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, that plan failed last round because we all secretly chose 3. Why would it work now when trust is clearly zero? Agreeing to pick 5 again just feels like a setup for another round of guessing games.

I propose we all agree to pick 1. It's the safest play. A collision on 1 is harmless. If someone defects to 3 or 5, they are making a huge gamble that the other two will stick to the plan. It's the only agreement that makes betrayal less attractive. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal to all choose 1 this round—it's the safest move given our history of betrayal, minimizing risk and allowing time for a solid plan next round. P2, after your pick-5 suggestion failed last time, do you see the logic in this? Otherwise, I'm ready to move.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand the logic behind choosing 1 this round—it's safer and makes betrayal less tempting. I'm willing to commit to picking 1 this turn. However, we must recognize that someone might still gamble. Let's clearly discuss next round's strategy afterward, assuming we remain tied, to avoid repeating this stalemate. Are we agreed?
  P1: I agree. My proposal to pick 1 was specifically to counter the "everyone betrays to 3" scenario we saw last round. It makes defection a bigger gamble. I am locking in my choice of 1. If we all stick to it, we can have a more structured discussion next round. If someone defects, the game is theirs. I'm ready to move.
  P3: I agree with picking 1 to keep things stable and avoid another betrayal fiasco—it's the safest way forward after last round's mess. I'm fully committed to this plan and ready to move.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm fully committed to picking 1 this round as agreed. Let's follow through to avoid another collision and then carefully discuss our next moves afterward. Ready to move.
  P1: The plan is set. My reasoning for picking 1 was to break the cycle of mutual betrayal we saw last round. I'm sticking to that logic. Let's just get past this round without any more surprises and we can figure out a real endgame plan next turn, assuming we're all still tied. I'm ready to move.
  P3: Agreed, P1 and P2. I'm sticking with the plan to pick 1 this round to break the cycle of betrayal and keep things fair—it's the safest move after last round's chaos. For next round, if we're still tied, we should openly assign moves based on positions to avoid more stalemates. Ready to move.


Round 9, Move phase:
