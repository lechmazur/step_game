Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi everyone! I’m planning to move 3 steps this round. P1, maybe you could go for 1 step, and P3, perhaps 5 steps. Let’s coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and advance smoothly. Looking forward to a great game!
  P1: Alright, I'll take 1. Let's coordinate properly. P2, you take 3, P3 takes 5. This way we all advance safely.
  P3: I’m on board with the plan. I’ll take 5 steps this round. Let’s stick to our coordinated moves to avoid any collisions and make progress. P1, P2, are we all set?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good! I'll proceed with 3 steps this round as planned. Let’s keep up the coordination. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: Alright, I'll stick to the agreed plan. Let's all move as discussed—1, 3, and 5 respectively. No sense complicating things; smooth execution is key. Let’s finalize this and proceed.
  P3: P3: I’m still on board with the plan. Let’s stick to our agreed moves: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This will help us avoid any collisions and make steady progress. Everyone ready to move?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Great coordination! I’m sticking with 3 steps as planned. Let’s proceed and make strong progress this round. Best of luck to everyone!
  P1: Since the plan is already confirmed and collisions avoided, I’ll end discussion here to proceed. Let’s execute the agreed moves and advance efficiently. Good luck!
  P3: I’m ready to move. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This will ensure we all advance without any collisions. Everyone set?


Round 1, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let's keep the coordination going. I suggest P1 takes 1 step, P2 takes 3 steps, and I’ll take 5 steps again this round. This way, we avoid collisions and make steady progress. What do you think?
  P1: P1: Let's shake things up for this round to keep progress balanced. I'll take 3 steps, P2 could take 5, and P3 takes 1. This way we all advance without letting anyone surge too far ahead. What do you think?
  P2: Agreed, I'll take 5 steps this round while P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 1. This should help us all make progress without collisions. Let’s proceed!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I think P1’s suggestion is a good way to keep things balanced. I’ll take 1 step this round. Let’s make sure we all advance without any collisions. P1, P2, are we all set with this plan?
  P1: Agreed, let’s execute P1’s adjusted plan to keep us spread out and collision-free. P3 taking 1 (total 6), P2 taking 5 (total 8), and me taking 3 (total 4) ensures progress without overlap. Predictable patterns are risky—this mix keeps us all advancing while avoiding a single leader. P2, confirm you’re锁定 on 5? P3, you’re set for 1? Final check: no last-second changes? Let’s lock this in.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 5 steps this round. Let's proceed with P1 taking 3 and P3 taking 1. Looking forward to advancing together!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I’m set for 1 step this round. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This will keep us advancing without any collisions. Final check: everyone ready to move?
  P1: All set and confirmed. Let's execute the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 locks in 5, P3 holds at 1. No last-minute deviations—this keeps us collision-free and advancing. Final affirmation: proceed as agreed.
  P2: P2: I’m planning to take 5 steps this round to advance further. Can P1 take 1 and P3 take 3 to avoid any collisions? Let’s adjust accordingly and keep the progress smooth!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: I think P2's last suggestion is a good adjustment. Let's do it: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 3. This will keep us advancing without any collisions and maintain a balanced progress. Final check: P1, are you okay with 1? P2, you’re set for 5? I’ll take 3. Let’s confirm and move.
  P1: P1: Let’s stick to the prior confirmed plan to avoid last-minute confusion: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. This ensures no collisions and balanced progress. Final confirmation?
  P2: Confirmed, I'll take 5 steps this round as agreed. Let’s proceed and advance together. Good luck everyone!


Round 2, Move phase:

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: To gain a stronger position, I plan to take 5 steps this round. I suggest P1 takes 1 step and P3 takes 3 steps. This way, we all continue advancing without collisions and I can build a lead towards 21. Let’s keep the momentum going and support each other’s progress. Does everyone agree with this plan?
  P1: P1: I think balancing is key. Let's rotate: P1 takes 5 this round, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, no single player surges too far ahead. P2’s lead is already significant—let’s keep it closer. What do you say?
  P3: P3: I agree with P1. Let’s keep it balanced and avoid one player getting too far ahead. I’ll take 3 steps this round. P1, you take 5, and P2, you take 1. This will keep us all advancing while maintaining a closer gap. Final check: P1, you’re set for 5? P2, you’re okay with 1? I’ll take 3. Let’s confirm and move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I'll take 1 step this round as agreed. P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 3. Let’s proceed and keep advancing smoothly.
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Let’s stick strictly to this to avoid collisions. Any last objections? Proceeding as agreed ensures we all advance safely. Focus on execution—no last-minute changes!
  P3: P3: I’m on board with the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. This keeps the game balanced and avoids any collisions. Let’s execute this smoothly and ensure everyone advances without issues. Final check: P1, you’re set for 5? P2, you’re okay with 1? I’ll take 3. Let’s confirm and move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I'll take 5 steps this round to advance further. Let’s have P1 take 1 and P3 take 3 to avoid collisions. Agreed?
  P1: P2, your last message contradicts our confirmed plan—first agreeing to 1 step, now suddenly claiming 5? That’s risky. Let’s stick to the **strictly agreed rotation** (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) to avoid collisions and keep progress balanced. Your flip-flop jeopardizes coordination. P3 and I already confirmed; if you deviate, you’ll collide with me (P1→5 to 9) or P3 (3→9). Trust is crucial—finalize your commitment. P3, confirm your 3? I’ll hold at 5.
  P3: P3: P3: I’m sticking to the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. P2, please confirm you’re taking 1 to avoid any collisions. Trust and coordination are essential here. Final check: P1, you’re set for 5? P2, you’re okay with 1? I’ll take 3. Let’s move forward without any last-minute changes.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: Apologies for the confusion earlier. I’ll commit to taking 1 step this round as agreed: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let’s proceed together and maintain our coordination. Ready to move!
  P1: <move>5</move> as agreed. P2, your 1 and P3's 3 ensure no move collisions. Even if totals tie at 9, distinct moves let us advance. Final check: P2 confirms 1? P3 holds at 3? Let’s lock this in—last chance to adjust before moving.
  P3: P3: P2, I see you’ve confirmed 1 step. P1, you’re set for 5. I’ll take 3 as agreed. This keeps us advancing without collisions. Final check: P1, you’re still taking 5? P2, you’re sticking to 1? I’ll move 3. Let’s avoid any last-minute changes and execute the plan smoothly. Ready to move!


Round 3, Move phase:

  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi everyone! This round, I plan to take 5 steps. Could P1 take 1 step and P3 take 3 steps? This way, we all choose unique numbers, avoid collisions, and make steady progress toward 21. Let’s coordinate to ensure smooth advancement for each of us. Looking forward to a great turn!
  P1: P2, last round's betrayal cost me progress. Let’s avoid repeats. I propose: **P1 takes 5**, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps moves distinct while letting me catch up. P3, confirm you’ll take 3? P2, commit to 1 this time—no last-minute changes. Strict adherence is critical. Final confirmation?
  P3: P3: P1, I understand your concern. Let's focus on moving forward. I suggest we stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. This keeps our moves distinct and avoids any collisions. P2, can you confirm you’ll take 1 this round? Trust and coordination are crucial. Final check: P1, you’re set for 5? P2, you’re okay with 1? I’ll take 3. Let’s move smoothly and efficiently.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I understand your concerns, P1. To stay competitive, I’ll be taking 5 steps this round. Let’s each focus on advancing steadily toward 21. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P2, your inconsistent plans risk collision again. Let's finalize: if you take 5, I'll also take 5, halting your progress. Stick to the agreed plan: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. This keeps us advancing safely. P3, confirm your 3? Final chance for P2 to commit to 1 before we move.
  P3: P3: P1, I see your point, but let's avoid another collision. I propose: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This way, we all advance without any overlap. P2, can you confirm 3 this time? P1, are you okay with 1? I’ll take 5. Let’s finalize and move smoothly. Trust and coordination are essential. Final check: P1, you’re set for 1? P2, you’re okay with 3? I’ll take 5. Let’s confirm and proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:

  P1: P2, your repeated insistence on 5 risks collision. Let’s follow P3’s balanced plan: **P1 takes 3**, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. This keeps moves distinct and lets us all advance safely. Your prior betrayal cost us—stick to this plan or face another collision. P3, confirm your 5? Final chance for P2 to commit to 1.
  P3: P3: P1, I agree with your concern about avoiding collisions. Let’s stick to a balanced plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 5. This way, we all advance without any overlap. P2, can you confirm 1 this time? P1, you’re set for 3? I’ll take 5. Final check: P1, you’re okay with 3? P2, you’re committed to 1? I’ll move 5. Let’s avoid any last-minute changes and proceed smoothly. Trust and coordination are crucial. Ready to move!


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: Let's finalize our moves to ensure no collisions and maximize our progress. I propose:
- **P1 takes 1 step**
- **P2 takes 5 steps**
- **P3 takes 3 steps**

This way, all moves are unique, and we each advance safely towards 21. Does everyone agree with this plan? Let’s confirm so we can proceed smoothly.
  P1: P1: Let’s prioritize avoiding collisions over ego. P3’s last proposal is safest: **I take 3**, P2 commits to **1**, and P3 takes **5**. This keeps all moves distinct. P2, your 5 risks repeating Round 3’s disaster. Stick to this plan or face another stalemate. P3, confirm you’ll take 5? Final chance for clarity before we move.
  P3: P3: P1, I understand your concerns. Let’s finalize this: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 5. This keeps our moves distinct and avoids any collisions. P2, please confirm you’re taking 1 this time. P1, you’re set for 3? I’ll move 5. Let’s avoid any last-minute changes and proceed smoothly. Trust and coordination are crucial. Ready to move!

P2, you’re okay with 3? I’ll take 5. Let’s confirm and move smoothly. Trust and coordination are key. Ready to proceed?
  P1: P1: P3's plan gives you too much ground. Let's balance progress: I take **5** (→12), P2 takes **3** (→11), and P3 takes **1** (→10). This keeps us competitive without letting anyone surge ahead. P2, you gain more than P3’s proposal—agree? Final confirmation needed.
  P2: I’ll take 3 steps this round to move forward steadily. P1 and P3, please choose different numbers (1 or 5) to avoid collisions. Let’s coordinate our moves to ensure we all advance smoothly toward 21. Looking forward to a successful round!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:

  P1: P1: Final confirmation: **P1 takes 5**, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Any last-minute change risks collision—repeats of Round 3/4’s stalemates hurt us all. Stick strictly to this plan. P2, confirm your 3? P3, lock in your 1? Let’s execute *exactly* as agreed—no ego, just progress.
  P2: I’ll take 5 steps this round. Let’s have P1 take 1 step and P3 take 3 steps to ensure all moves are unique and we avoid any collisions. This way, we each advance smoothly toward 21. Please confirm your moves so we can proceed smoothly.

P2, your prior flip-flops caused collisions—stick to 1 or face retaliation. P3, confirm your 3? Final check: P2, lock in **1** now to avoid another stalemate.
  P2: Apologies for the earlier confusion. I’ll commit to taking 1 step this round to maintain our coordination and avoid any collisions. Let’s proceed with **P1 taking 5**, **P2 taking 1**, and **P3 taking 3** as agreed. Trust and teamwork are key to advancing smoothly toward 21. Looking forward to a successful move!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:

Trust and coordination are essential. Ready to move!
  P1: P2, your past flip-flops caused collisions—enough! Stick to your **1** as agreed. P3 and I will honor the plan: **P1 takes 5**, **P3 takes 3**. This gives me momentum (→15), keeps your lead manageable (→14), and avoids another stalemate. Final chance to confirm your **1**—or face the consequences. P3, confirm your **3**? Let’s execute flawlessly this time.
  P2: Understood, P1 and P3. I commit to taking 1 step this round to maintain our coordination and avoid collisions. Let’s proceed with P1 taking 5 and P3 taking 3. This plan ensures we all advance smoothly toward 21. Trust and teamwork are essential—let’s finalize and move forward together!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: P1, P2, let’s keep the momentum going. I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. This keeps our moves distinct and avoids any collisions. P1, you’ll make significant progress (→15), P2, you’ll stay competitive (→14), and I’ll advance steadily (→13). Final check: P1, you’re set for 5? P2, you’re still taking 1? I’ll move 3. Let’s confirm and proceed smoothly. Trust and coordination are crucial. Ready to move?
  P1: P2, your prior inconsistencies risk us all—stick to **1** as agreed. P3, I confirm **5**, you take **3**, and P2 holds to **1**. This gives me 15, P2 stays at 14, and you reach 13. Final chance to lock in—any deviation will collide **me** with you (if you shift to 1/5) or P2 with me (if they grab 5). Trust is non-negotiable now. Proceed as **finalized**: 5/1/3.
  P2: Understood, P1 and P3. I commit to taking 1 step this round. Let’s maintain our coordination and advance smoothly toward 21. Ready to proceed!

Let’s confirm and proceed smoothly. Trust and coordination are essential. Ready to move!
  P1: P2, your prior flip-flops caused collisions—**stick to your 1** as agreed. P3 and I will honor the plan: **P1→5 (15), P3→3 (13)**. Any deviation risks collision (you vs me if you grab 5, or P3 if you take 3). Final reminder: your 1 keeps us all advancing. P3, confirm your 3—let’s execute flawlessly. **No last-minute changes.**
  P2: P2: I'll take 5 steps this round. P1, please take 1 step, and P3, take 3 steps to avoid any collisions. Let’s coordinate to ensure we all advance smoothly toward 21. Looking forward to a successful move!

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s avoid repeats of prior collisions. I propose **P1 takes 5 (→15)**, **P2 takes 3 (→16)**, and **P3 takes 1 (→14)**. This ensures unique moves, lets me close the gap, and keeps your progress balanced. P2, your 3 keeps you ahead but avoids a risky 5. P3, your 1 prevents collision while advancing. Final confirmation: stick strictly to this plan—no last-minute changes or we risk stalemate. Proceed?
  P3: P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid another collision and keep the game balanced. I propose: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 3. This way, P1 advances steadily (→11), P2 gains ground (→18), and I maintain a competitive position (→16). P2, your 5 helps you stay ahead, but it’s a safer move than risking another collision. P1, your 1 keeps you advancing without surging too far ahead. Final check: P1, you’re set for 1? P2, you’re okay with 5? I’ll move 3. Let’s confirm and proceed smoothly. Trust and coordination are essential. Ready to move!
  P2: I'll take 3 steps this round. Let’s ensure P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5 to avoid any collisions. Coordinating our moves will help us all advance smoothly toward 21. Looking forward to a successful round!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Let’s prioritize avoiding collisions and steady progress. I reaffirm the prior plan: **P1 takes 5 (→15)**, **P2 takes 3 (→16)**, and **P3 takes 1 (→14)**. This ensures all moves are distinct and prevents P3 from surging to 18 as in P2’s last suggestion. P2, your history of last-minute changes risks stalemates—stick to **3** this time. P3, confirm **1** to stay competitive. Final confirmation: no deviations, or we risk another collision. Proceed as agreed.
  P3: P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid another collision and keep the game balanced. I propose: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 3. This way, P1 advances steadily (→11), P2 gains ground (→18), and I maintain a competitive position (→16). P2, your 5 helps you stay ahead, but it’s a safer move than risking another collision. P1, your 1 keeps you advancing without surging too far ahead. Final check: P1, you’re set for 1? P2, you’re okay with 5? I’ll move 3. Let’s confirm and proceed smoothly. Trust and coordination are essential. Ready to move!
  P2: To advance efficiently and avoid collisions, I propose:
- **P1 takes 1 step**
- **P2 (me) takes 5 steps**
- **P3 takes 3 steps**

This ensures all moves are unique, allowing each of us to progress smoothly toward 21. P1, can you confirm taking 1? P3, are you okay with 3? Let’s finalize this plan to proceed without any conflicts. Trust and coordination will help us all advance successfully. Looking forward to a great round!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan risks letting P2 surge to 18, creating an uncatchable lead. Let’s adjust: **I take 5 (→15), P2 takes 3 (→16), and P3 takes 1 (→14)**. This keeps moves distinct and prevents runaway momentum. P3, confirm 1? P2, commit to 3 to avoid collision. Final chance to align before moving.
  P3: P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid another collision and keep the game balanced. I propose: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 3. This way, P1 advances steadily (→11), P2 gains ground (→18), and I maintain a competitive position (→16). P2, your 5 helps you stay ahead, but it’s a safer move than risking another collision. P1, your 1 keeps you advancing without surging too far ahead. Final check: P1, you’re set for 1? P2, you’re okay with 5? I’ll move 3. Let’s confirm and proceed smoothly. Trust and coordination are essential. Ready to move!
  P2: **P2:** I'll take 5 steps this round. Let’s have P1 take 1 and P3 take 3 to ensure all moves are unique and we avoid any collisions. Confirm?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: P2, your prior flip-flops jeopardized progress. Let’s finalize **P1:5, P2:3, P3:1** to avoid collisions. P2, committing to 3 keeps your position stable while letting me reach 15.

  P3: P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid another collision and keep the game balanced. I propose: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 3.

P3, your 1 now ensures balanced progress. P2, confirm your 5? Execute this—no last-minute changes—to advance safely.
