P2, your analysis holds: if we both pick 5, we crash and P3 wins with a simple 1 or 3. If we both pick 3, we crash and P3 wins.\n\nThe only winning path for us collectively is to split the numbers 5 and 3. Since you took 5 last round, it is my turn.\n\nI confirm I am strictly locked on **5** (to 26).\nP2 takes **3** (to 24).\nP3 takes **1** (to 23).\n\nThis order is: P1 (1st), P3 (2nd if they switch to 3, else 3rd), P2 (2nd/3rd). P3, taking 5 only hands the win to P2 via collision, so sticking to 1 or 3 is your best play for points.\n\nReady to move."}
