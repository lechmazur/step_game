Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, first round. Seems like everyone will want 5. To avoid a collision, I might play it safe and go for 1 or 3 this time. What are you two thinking?
  P2: "Sounds reasonable P3. I'm also thinking of avoiding 5 this round to get some guaranteed steps. Let's aim for a non-collision start."
  P1: To avoid collision in the first round, I agree that playing it safe is a good strategy. However, if both of you choose 1 or 3, and I choose the other safe option, one of us will still advance. I'll consider this when making my move. For now, I'm inclined towards 3, but I'll wait for your next thoughts. Let's discuss further to see if we can coordinate our moves effectively.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1, noted on 3. P2, what's your inclination between 1 and 3? If you both choose 3, you'll block each other. If you split 1 and 3, then 5 is left open, but maybe too tempting and risky for round 1? Perhaps sticking to 1 or 3 is safest for everyone initially.
  P2: P3, between 1 and 3, I'm leaning towards 1. How about you take 3? This way we can both move forward, and P1 can decide what they want to do.
  P1: P2 and P3, it seems like you're coordinating to avoid collision by choosing 1 and 3. If P2 goes for 1 and P3 goes for 3, I'll consider choosing 5 since it's less likely to be blocked by both of you. However, I need to be cautious as it might be a risk if one of you decides to deviate. P3, are you firm on choosing 3?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, yes, 3 seems like a reasonable choice for me, especially if P2 sticks with 1 as suggested. It gives us both a chance to get on the board. But as you said, it's always a risk until the moves are revealed. Everyone has to decide for themselves.
  P2: Okay P3, I'm sticking with 1 as discussed. P1, are you going for 5 then, as you mentioned?  Let's try to get everyone moving forward this round.
  P1: Since P2 and P3 are coordinating to choose 1 and 3 respectively, I'll weigh my options. If they stick to their plan, choosing 5 is a viable option as it won't collide with theirs. However, to avoid a potential collision if one of them deviates, I'm considering an alternative. P3, are you open to switching to 1 if P2 chooses 3 instead, to keep the coordination flexible? This might help us avoid a collision more effectively.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, Round 1 worked out, everyone moved. P1 is now in the lead with 5 steps.

P1, you might want to play safe to protect your lead. P2, you're behind, so 5 might look appealing. I'm in the middle.

A collision on 5 seems possible this round. What if P2 and I aim for 1 and 3 again to guarantee movement, leaving P1 to decide whether to risk 5 or play safer? What do you think?
  P1: P3's suggestion for P2 and P3 to aim for 1 and 3 again is a good strategy to avoid collision. However, P2 might be tempted to choose 5 to catch up. To mitigate this, I propose that P2 and P3 stick to 1 and 3, and I'll consider choosing a safer option, like 1 or 3, to avoid a collision on 5. This way, we can all move forward. P2, are you willing to stick to 1 again?
  P2: Okay P1, yes, I'm happy to stick with 1 again this round as we discussed.  It seems like a safe way to ensure we all keep progressing. Let's aim for another round of no collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P2, sounds like you're set on 1. P1, your logic about avoiding a 5 collision is sound. Hopefully, we can all find a way to advance this round too.
  P1: To avoid a collision on 5 this round, I'll consider 1 or 3. Since P2 is sticking to 1 and P3 is likely to choose 3, I'll choose the one that doesn't collide with them. If P3 sticks to 3, I'll pick 1. This way, we all move forward. P3, confirm if you're sticking to 3 this round. Let's keep the progress smooth.
  P2: P1, P3, sounds like a plan. To spread out even more, how about P3 takes 1 this round and I take 3? Still aiming for no collisions and steady progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you just suggested swapping to 3 and me to 1? That changes the plan P1 was reacting to. I was thinking 3 was settled for me. Hmm, okay.
  P1: P2 and P3, let's finalize our plan. P2 suggested swapping numbers this round, with P3 taking 1 and P2 taking 3. If that's the case, I'll adjust my move accordingly to avoid collision. P3, are you confirming the swap? If so, I'll choose a different number. Let's stick to the plan to ensure everyone moves forward. Please confirm your final decision.
  P2: Yes P1, let's go with the swap as I suggested. P3 will take 1 and I will take 3. P1, to ensure no collision and everyone moves forward, how about you take 5? This way we all spread out again.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, that collision on 5 wasn't ideal for P1 or me. P2, you made out well there.
P1, we both lost a turn while P2 closed the gap. We probably shouldn't let that happen again. I'm last, so I definitely need points this round. What's the thinking to avoid another stalemate, especially between us two?
  P2: Yes P3, good point.  Let's definitely avoid another collision especially on 5.  Perhaps P1 could consider 1 or 3 this round to guarantee movement for themselves and avoid blocking either of us? I'm flexible between 1 and 5 depending on what you and P1 are thinking.
  P1: To avoid another collision on 5, I will consider 1 or 3. P2 is flexible between 1 and 5. P3, if you choose 5, I'll pick either 1 or 3. If you choose 1 or 3, I'll pick the other safe option. Let's coordinate to ensure everyone moves. P2, are you leaning towards 1 or 5 this round? P3, what's your plan to avoid a collision and get back on track?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, understood you'll pick 1 or 3, avoiding 5. P2, you mentioned flexibility between 1 and 5. Since I'm behind, 5 is very attractive for me this round.

P2, if you were leaning towards 1, that might make 5 safer for me, and P1 could take 3. If you were leaning towards 5, then P1 and I would need to coordinate 1 and 3 carefully to avoid collision. What direction are you leaning, P2?
  P2: P3, if you are leaning towards 5 to catch up, I'm willing to aim for 1 or 3 to help avoid another collision on 5. P1, which of 1 or 3 are you more inclined to take this round?  Knowing your preference will help me decide between the remaining safe options.
  P1: To avoid another collision on 5, I'll choose between 1 and 3. P2 is flexible, and P3 is considering 5. P3, if you choose 5, I'll pick the safe option not taken by P2. P2, please clarify your inclination between 1 and 5. If you're leaning towards 1, P3 can take 5, and I'll take 3. If you're leaning towards 5, we'll need to coordinate 1 and 3. Let's finalize our moves to ensure progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, it sounds like P1 and P2 are coordinating on 1 and 3 to avoid collision, which makes sense. Given I'm behind, I really need the points, so 5 looks like my best option this round. If P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 1 as P1 suggested earlier, we should all move. Let's hope for no collisions this round.
  P2: Okay P1, let's solidify the plan then.  If P3 is set on 5, and you are taking 3 as discussed, I will take 1. This should ensure we all move forward this round.
  P1: To ensure we all move forward this round, let's confirm our plan. P3 is set on 5, I'll take 3, and P2 will take 1. This way, we avoid collision and make progress. P2, please confirm if you're sticking to 1. If so, we have a solid plan to move forward without collisions. Let's finalize our moves. I'm ready to proceed with 3 if P2 confirms 1.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given the current standings, P3 and I are tied for the lead. To maintain or improve my position, I need to be cautious about collisions. P2 is behind and might be tempted to choose 5. To avoid this, I suggest P2 and I coordinate on safe moves. P2, if you choose 1, I'll consider 3. P3, if you're not choosing 5, you could take the remaining safe option. Let's discuss and coordinate our moves to ensure everyone progresses without collisions. What's your inclination, P2?
  P3: P1, your suggestion for P2=1 and you=3 leaves 5 open. Since we're tied for the lead, 5 is naturally attractive for me to pull ahead. Are you sure you're comfortable with taking 3 in that scenario?

P2, P1 is suggesting you take 1, which is slow progress given you're behind. Are you agreeable to that, or is 5 more tempting for you to catch up?

It feels like 5 might be a popular choice this round. We should be careful to avoid collisions, especially between P1 and me.
  P2: P3, you're right, 5 is tempting to catch up.  P1, I agree 1 is slow for me right now. P3, are you seriously considering 5?  If so, maybe P1 and I should aim for 1 and 3 to let you take 5 safely.  Or should we all avoid 5 this round to be safe? What are your thoughts on the risk of a 5 collision?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 is behind and might be tempted to choose 5 to catch up. To avoid a collision on 5, I can choose a safer option. If P3 avoids 5, I can take it. P2, if you're considering 5, let's coordinate on 1 and 3. P3, are you leaning towards 5 or a safer option? If P3 takes 5, I'll choose between 1 and 3. Let's avoid another collision on 5. P2, please clarify your inclination to help us finalize our moves.
  P3: P1, P2, thanks for clarifying. Yes, given we're tied for the lead, 5 is the logical move for me to try and gain an advantage. It seems risky for either of you to also choose 5, as a collision helps neither of us leaders and doesn't guarantee P2 catches up.

If you coordinate on 1 and 3, you both get guaranteed points. P1, perhaps you take 3 and P2 takes 1? That seems like a safe way for you both to advance while I take the risk/reward on 5.
  P2: P3, yes, that sounds like a reasonable plan. P1 taking 3, me taking 1, and you taking 5. I'm happy to go with that if P1 agrees. Let's aim for guaranteed movement again this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, let's finalize our plan. P3 is considering 5 to pull ahead, and we've discussed P2 taking 1 and me taking 3. This way, P3 can take 5 without collision. P2, please confirm if you're sticking to 1. If so, I'll proceed with 3, allowing P3 to take 5 safely. Let's ensure everyone moves forward this round. P2, your confirmation will help us move forward with the plan.
  P3: Okay, sounds like we have a plan. P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll aim for 5. This seems like the best way for everyone to advance this round. P2, if you confirm 1, then P1 takes 3, and I'll stick with 5. Let's lock it in.
  P2: Okay P1, P3, yes, I confirm I will take 1 as we discussed. Let's all stick to this plan for a guaranteed move forward this round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, new round. I'm at 13, P1 at 11, P2 at 6.
P1, we're close to each other. P2, you need bigger steps to catch up. This makes 5 look attractive to everyone, increasing the risk of collision there.

To guarantee progress, perhaps P1 and I should consider coordinating 1 and 3 again, leaving 5 open for P2? Or maybe P2 wants to coordinate safe moves too? What are your initial thoughts this round?
  P2: "P3, that sounds like a reasonable plan. 5 is indeed very tempting for me to catch up. P1, would you be willing to take 1 or 3 this round to let me take 5? That way we can all potentially move forward again."
  P1: P2 is behind and might be tempted to choose 5. To avoid a collision, I can coordinate with P3 on 1 and 3. If P3 takes 1, I'll take 3, or vice versa. This way, one of us will move, and P2 can take 5. P3, are you open to coordinating on 1 or 3? Alternatively, if P2 is willing to take a safer option, we can adjust our moves accordingly. P2, what's your inclination this round?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, yes, I'm open to coordinating 1 and 3 with you to let P2 take 5, as you suggested. That seems like a good way to avoid collisions while letting everyone advance.

How about I aim for 3 this round, and you take 1? P2 can then take 5. This way, I get a decent step, you get a safe step, and P2 gets a chance to catch up a bit. Does that sound agreeable? P2, does 5 work for you under this plan?
  P2: P3, yes, 5 works great for me under this plan.  Taking 5 sounds good. Let's go with P3 taking 3, P1 taking 1, and I'll take 5. This plan works for me.
  P1: P3 and I have discussed coordinating on 1 and 3. Let's finalize the plan. P3 will take 3, I'll take 1, and P2 will take 5. This way, we avoid collisions and everyone moves forward. P2, please confirm if you're sticking to 5. If so, we'll proceed with the plan. I'll take 1 as agreed. Let's lock in our moves for this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, sounds like we're agreed. P2 confirms 5, P1 confirms 1, and I'll stick with 3 as planned. Let's hope everyone follows through so we all advance.
  P2: Okay P1, P3, yes I confirm I'm taking 5 as planned. Let's all make our moves and hope for no collisions this round!
  P1: Let's finalize our plan for Round 5. P3 will take 3, I'll take 1, and P2 will take 5. To confirm, P2, are you sticking to 5? If so, we'll proceed with the plan. I've noted P3's confirmation for 3 and will take 1 as agreed. Let's ensure everyone moves forward without collisions this round. Please confirm your move, P2.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is in the lead now. To maintain or improve my position, I need to be cautious. P2 is getting closer to me, and might be tempted to take risks. Let's avoid collisions. P3, if you choose 5, I'll consider 1 or 3. P2, if you're considering 5, we should coordinate on 1 and 3. Alternatively, if P2 takes a safe option, P3 and I can discuss our moves. P2, what's your inclination this round? Should we coordinate on safe moves or is 5 tempting for you?
  P2: P1, I am tempted by 5 to catch up, as you guessed. If P3 is also considering 5, maybe we should coordinate on 1 and 3 to leave 5 open for one of us. What do you think P3 is planning?  Perhaps we can aim for no collisions again this round.
  P3: P1, P2, yes, 5 is tempting for everyone near the end. I only need 3 to win, so that's a possibility for me. 5 is also an option. A collision now would be frustrating for me. To guarantee you both advance and avoid potentially blocking my winning move (whether it's 3 or 5), coordinating on 1 and 3 seems like your safest bet. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3 is close to winning and has multiple options to win. To avoid a collision and ensure progress, I suggest P2 and I coordinate on safe moves. If P3 chooses 5, I'll take 1 or 3. If P3 chooses 3, I'll take 1. P2, if you take 5, we can make it work. Alternatively, if you take a safe option, P3 can choose between 3 or 5. P2, are you leaning towards 5 or a safer move? Let's coordinate to avoid a collision and ensure everyone moves forward.
  P2: I am definitely tempted by 5 to try and catch up, especially since P3 is so close to winning.  If we both went for 5, P1 could take 1 or 3 and still move forward. What do you think P1? Are you leaning towards a safe 1 or 3 yourself?
  P3: P1, P2, as I said, 3 wins it for me. 5 also wins. Given P2's stated temptation for 5, maybe P1 should consider 1 to be safe? If P2 does go for 5, and P1 takes 1, that leaves 3 open for my win. Of course, if you both coordinate 1 and 3, you block each other and potentially block me too. Just thinking aloud about the possibilities. What are you thinking now, P2?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3 is very close to winning and has multiple winning options. To avoid a collision and ensure progress, I suggest P2 and I coordinate on safe moves. If P3 chooses 5, I'll take 1 or 3. If P3 chooses 3, I'll take 1. P2, if you're set on 5, let's proceed with the plan. Alternatively, if you take a safe option, P3 can choose between 3 or 5. P2, please clarify your final inclination to help us finalize our moves.
  P2: Okay P1, P3, to be clear, I am going for 5 this round to try and close the gap. Let's see how you two want to play it.
  P3: Okay P2, thanks for the clear statement on 5. That simplifies things. Given that, 3 is the obvious winning move for me this turn.

P1, based on our earlier discussion and P2 choosing 5, taking 1 seems like your safe move to guarantee points and avoid any potential collisions.

Let's wrap this up.
