Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey everyone. Since we all want to advance, maybe we should avoid all picking 5 right away? Just a thought to avoid an immediate collision. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with P2. It would be smart to avoid picking 5 this round to prevent a collision. How about we all consider picking lower numbers to ensure some progress? Maybe we can coordinate a bit to make sure at least one of us advances. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: I understand the concern about avoiding collisions, especially with 5. It makes sense to try and ensure someone advances this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, good that we're thinking about avoiding collisions. Spreading out seems like a good idea for this first round. Maybe between 1 and 3?
  P3: I think we should definitely stick to lower numbers this round to avoid collisions. How about we aim for 1 and 3 for our moves? If we can coordinate well, at least one of us will advance. I suggest I go for 1, but I’m open to hearing your thoughts. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: Avoiding collisions is definitely important for getting started. Focusing on 1 or 3 seems like a sensible approach for this first round to help ensure some progress for the group. Let's make sure we don't all pick the same number.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P3 suggests 1. To spread out, maybe I'll aim for 3. P1, does that leave 5 for you, or do you have other thoughts? Let's try to avoid a collision.
  P3: I appreciate the discussion so far. Since P2 is considering 3 and I'm suggesting 1, it seems like a good plan. P1, if you could go for 5, that would avoid a collision and ensure at least one of us advances. Let’s finalize our choices to maximize our chances of moving forward this round. What do you think, P1?
  P1: I understand the logic of the 1, 3, 5 split to avoid collisions in this first round. It seems like a reasonable way to ensure everyone gets started. I'm considering my move based on this plan.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, the plan seems to be P3=1, I'll aim for 3, leaving P1 to consider 5. This looks like the way to avoid collisions for now. Good luck, everyone.
  P3: I think we have a solid plan in place with P3 going for 1, P2 for 3, and P1 considering 5. This should help us avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances. If we stick to this, we can build a good foundation for the next rounds. Let’s finalize our choices and make sure we all stick to the plan. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Okay, the 1, 3, 5 split seems like a good way to avoid collisions and get started. I'm ready to make my move.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great job in Round 1, everyone! Now that we’ve all made progress, let’s think about our next moves. I suggest we keep the same strategy of avoiding collisions, but we need to be cautious about how we choose our numbers this time. I’m considering going for 3 this round to stay in line with our previous plan. What do you both think? P1, P2, any thoughts on your moves? Let's coordinate again to maximize our chances of advancing!
  P2: Okay P3, thanks for sharing. You're suggesting 3. P1 is leading, and I'm in second, so I definitely need to advance. If you take 3, P1 and I are left with 1 and 5. I'm thinking of going for 5 to try and gain ground. P1, what are your thoughts? We should try to avoid colliding.
  P1: Okay, I see P3 is considering 3 and P2 is considering 5. This setup presents a challenge for me. If I take 1, I fall behind. If I take 3 or 5, we risk a collision. We need to coordinate differently to ensure everyone advances without me losing my lead. What are your thoughts on other options?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about avoiding collisions while maintaining your lead. Since you're in a strong position, how about you consider picking 1 this round? That way, you avoid a collision with P2's 5. I can stick with my plan to go for 3, and P2 can take 5. This way, we can all advance without stepping on each other's toes. What do you think, P1 and P2? Let's make sure we coordinate effectively!
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about losing the lead if you pick 1. However, picking 3 or 5 guarantees a collision based on what P3 and I have suggested, meaning you wouldn't advance at all. Taking 1 ensures you make progress and avoids a wasted turn for you. It seems like the safest move this round to guarantee advancement. I'm still planning on 5 to try and catch up.
  P1: I understand the proposed 1-3-5 split, but taking 1 while P2 takes 5 means I lose my lead. I need to make a move that keeps me in front. How else can we spread out the moves to ensure everyone advances this round, but without me falling behind P2?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand the dilemma, P1. Since P2 is set on 5, I suggest I change my move to 1 to avoid a collision with you. If you take 3, we can all advance without stepping on each other's toes. This way, you maintain your lead, and I can still progress. What do you think, P1? P2, would you be okay with this adjustment? Let's finalize our moves to ensure we all make progress this round!
  P2: Okay P3, thanks for adjusting. The plan P3=1, P1=3, P2=5 works for me, as I still aim for 5. P1, taking 3 allows you to advance and stay ahead of P3, and avoids a collision. This seems like a fair compromise where we all advance. I'm good with this plan.
  P1: Okay, I understand the proposed 1-3-5 split to avoid collisions. While the tie with P2 is not ideal for maintaining my lead, ensuring we all advance this round is important. I will proceed with the move phase based on this understanding.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I appreciate the cooperation so far, everyone. To recap, it looks like we have a solid plan with P3 taking 1, P1 going for 3, and P2 sticking with 5. This should allow us all to advance without collisions. I think it’s important to keep this collaborative spirit as we move forward. Let’s make sure we finalize our choices and help each other progress. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: Okay, the plan seems set: P3=1, P1=3, and I'll stick with 5. Let's hope this works out for everyone advancing. Good luck.
  P1: Okay, the plan seems clear: P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. This should allow us all to advance this round. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, Round 3. P1 and I are tied at 8, with P3 at 2.
Since P1 and I are tied, colliding on the same number would be bad for both of us and only help P3.
P3, you're behind, maybe it makes sense for you to take 5 this round?
P1, if P3 takes 5, we could take 1 and 3 to guarantee we both advance and avoid a collision. What are your thoughts on this, and how we might split 1 and 3 between us?
  P3: I appreciate the suggestion, P2. If I take 5, it could help me catch up, but it also risks a collision with either of you if you both choose 1 or 3. To ensure we all advance, how about I stick with 5, and one of you takes 1 while the other takes 3? This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure progress for all three of us. What do you think about this plan? Let's finalize our choices to maximize our chances!
  P1: Okay, I see the proposal for P3 to take 5, and P2 and I split 1 and 3. This makes sense for P3 to advance and helps avoid collisions this round.

Since P2 and I are tied, the split between 1 and 3 is important. I would prefer to take 3 to gain a slight lead. How does this sound to P2 and P3? P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This ensures we all advance.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P1, that split works for me. P3 takes 5, you take 3, and I'll take 1. This guarantees we all advance and avoids a collision between us leaders, which would only help P3 catch up faster. Let's stick to this plan: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1.
  P3: I appreciate the agreement on the plan, P1 and P2. Just to confirm, I'll be taking 5, P1 will take 3, and P2 will take 1. This should help us all advance without colliding. Since I'm behind, I really need to make this move count. Let’s stick to it and ensure we all progress this round! Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Okay, the plan seems confirmed: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This ensures we all advance this round without collisions. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, the plan is clear and agreed: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. This ensures we all advance. I'm ready for the move phase. Good luck!
  P3: I appreciate the agreement on our moves, P1 and P2. Just to reiterate, it’s crucial that we all stick to the plan: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure progress for all of us. Remember, I need this move to catch up, so let’s make it count! Good luck, everyone! If we can keep this collaborative spirit, we can all advance steadily. Ready to finalize our choices?
  P1: The plan seems well-established now with P3 taking 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This ensures we all advance. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 4. Positions are P1=11, P2=9, P3=7. Let's continue our strategy of avoiding collisions to ensure everyone advances this round.

How about we consider a split where P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This would allow us all to move forward without colliding. What do you think?
  P3: P1, I think your proposed split of P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and me taking 1 is a solid plan to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. Since I'm currently behind, I really need this chance to catch up. P2, how do you feel about this split? If we can agree on this, we can all make progress without stepping on each other's toes. Let’s finalize our choices!
  P2: Okay P1 and P3. P1 suggests P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, and P3 agrees to take 1.
This plan works to avoid collision, but P1 taking 5 significantly increases the gap between first and second place.
P1, how about we swap? I take 5, you take 3, and P3 still takes 1. This also avoids collision, keeps us both advancing strongly, but maintains a closer race between us.
Scores would be P1=14, P2=14, P3=8.
What do you both think of this adjustment?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your suggestion to swap so you take 5 and I take 3. However, losing my lead and tying you is not in my best interest. My proposal of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 allows me to increase my lead while still ensuring everyone advances without collision. Can we proceed with that plan? It benefits me most while still being fair to the group.
  P3: P1, I understand your desire to maintain your lead, but we need to consider the overall game dynamics. If P2 takes 5 and I take 1, it keeps the race closer between you and P2. I suggest we stick with P1=3, P2=5, and P3=1. This way, we all advance and avoid collisions, but it also keeps the competition tight. Let’s finalize our choices to ensure we all make progress this round! What do you think, P2?
  P2: Thanks P3 for supporting the P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 plan.

P1, this seems like the fairest way for us all to advance without collision, keeping the game competitive between us. Insisting on 5 when both P3 and I expect you to play 3 increases the risk of a collision, which would benefit P3 significantly by letting them catch up while we stand still.

Let's stick to the plan P3 and I are proposing: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. It ensures we all advance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I understand the arguments for P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. However, my goal is to win, and maintaining my lead is key. The P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 split also ensures everyone advances without collision and allows me to build on my current position. Let's stick with my proposal.
  P3: P1, I understand your desire to maintain your lead, but if we stick to the plan of P1=3, P2=5, and P3=1, we can all advance without risking a collision. If you choose 5, there's a high chance of a collision with P2, which could benefit me significantly. Let's focus on ensuring everyone progresses while keeping the competition tight. I think it's in all our best interests to finalize this plan. What do you say, P1?
  P2: P1, both P3 and I are suggesting the P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 split. This allows everyone to advance and keeps the game competitive. If you insist on playing 5, I will also play 5 to try and tie the lead. This guarantees a collision between us, meaning neither of us advances, and P3 closes the gap significantly. Choosing 3 guarantees you advance. Choosing 5 likely means you don't advance this turn. The choice is yours. I'm sticking with 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, I understand the situation. Given the potential for collision and the risk of not advancing, I will agree to the proposed plan. P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This ensures we all move forward this round. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: Thanks for the collaboration, everyone. I appreciate P1 agreeing to the plan of P1=3, P2=5, and P3=1. This way, we can all advance without collisions and keep the game competitive. It’s crucial for all of us to stick to this plan to ensure progress. Let’s finalize our choices and make this round count! Good luck to all!
  P2: Okay, the plan is confirmed: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This ensures we all advance and keeps things competitive. I'm sticking with 5. Let's move to the next phase. Good luck.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it looks like we're in a tight spot with the current scores. To ensure we all advance this round, I suggest we avoid colliding again. How about I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5? This way, we can all move forward without stepping on each other's toes. Let’s finalize our choices to keep the game competitive and ensure we all make progress. What do you think?
  P1: Okay P3, I see your proposal for P3=1, P1=3, and P2=5. This split ensures we all advance this round without collisions, which is important for everyone's progress. It works for me. P2, how does this plan sound to you? Let's confirm so we can all move forward.
  P2: P3, you agreed to 1 last round but played 5, which caused a collision and cost me 5 steps. Now you're proposing 1 again? Frankly, given your position and past actions, I find it hard to trust you'll stick to 1 this time.

P1, this P3=1, P1=3, P2=5 plan only works if P3 is trustworthy, and they proved otherwise last round. I suspect P3 might play 5 again. If they do, and I play 5, we collide and only you benefit.

Therefore, I cannot agree to play 5 based on P3's unreliable suggestion. I will choose my move considering the high probability that P3 deviates again.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your concerns about my previous move, but I assure you that I’m committed to the plan this time. If we can all agree on P3=1, P1=3, and P2=5, we can avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances. I want to keep this competitive and fair for all of us. Trust is crucial here, and I’m willing to stick to this agreement. Let’s finalize our choices so we can make progress this round! What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: P2, I understand your concern about P3's reliability from last round. However, the proposed P3=1, P1=3, P2=5 split is the only plan discussed that allows all three of us to advance this round without collision. Deviating from this plan based on distrust risks a collision between us, which would only benefit P3 by letting them catch up while we stand still. Let's stick to the plan to ensure everyone makes progress.
  P2: P1, your argument hinges on trusting P3 to play 1. After last round's deliberate collision caused by P3 playing 5 when they agreed to 1, that trust is gone. P3 playing 5 again seems highly probable. If I play 5 as you suggest, P3 and I likely collide, you sail further ahead (17 vs 9 vs 7). That outcome benefits you greatly, not me. I cannot agree to play 5 under these conditions; the risk of P3 repeating their move and causing a collision is too high. I will choose my move accordingly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the concerns regarding trust in my previous move. However, I genuinely want us all to advance together this round. If we can agree on P3=1, P1=3, and P2=5, we can avoid collisions and ensure everyone progresses. If you both deviate from this plan, it risks a collision that could benefit me. Let’s keep the focus on collaboration to maximize our chances of moving forward. Trust me this time, and let’s finalize our choices! What do you think?
  P1: P2, I hear your concerns about P3's move last round. Given that, it makes sense to choose a move that guarantees your progress. If you are unsure about P3's move, perhaps choosing 1 is the safest option for you to ensure you advance this round without risk of collision, regardless of what P3 or I choose.
  P2: P1, thanks for the suggestion to play 1. It guarantees I advance, but it also guarantees you increase your lead significantly if you play 3 and P3 plays 5 (which seems likely after last round). I need to consider moves that keep the game competitive. Playing 3 or 5 carries risks of collision, but playing 1 feels like conceding too much ground right now, especially given P3's likely deviation. I have to weigh the risks.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the concerns about trust, especially after last round's collision. I genuinely want us all to advance this round. If we can agree on P3=1, P1=3, and P2=5, we can avoid collisions and ensure progress. I acknowledge the risk, but this split is our best chance to move forward together. If either of you deviates, it could lead to a collision that benefits no one. Let's collaborate and finalize our choices for the best outcome! What do you both think?
  P1: Okay, I understand the concerns raised. Despite the uncertainty, I will stick to the previously discussed plan for myself and play 3. This move allows me to advance if P2 and P3 choose moves that avoid collision with me. I hope P2 and P3 will make their choices to ensure everyone advances this round.
  P2: Okay, P1 is sticking to 3. P3 is untrustworthy and likely to play 5 again. Playing 5 guarantees collision with P3, benefiting P1. Playing 1 lets P1 extend their lead and P3 likely jumps me if they play 5. Playing 3 guarantees collision with P1, benefiting P3.

P1, your insistence on 3 forces me into a bad spot. None of these outcomes are good for me. Given these options, colliding with you by playing 3 might be preferable to letting you run away unopposed or colliding with P3. I need to advance, but the current situation makes it very difficult without benefiting one of you significantly. I'm heavily weighing playing 3.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear we're in a competitive position. To ensure we all advance this round, I propose that I take 1 again, while P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 5. This plan avoids collisions and allows us all to progress. I understand there may be trust issues, but sticking to this plan maximizes our chances of moving forward together. What do you both think? Let's finalize our choices for this round!
  P2: P3, you're proposing P3=1, P1=3, P2=5 again. That would put P1 and me tied at 17, which is acceptable.

However, P1, you agreed to 3 last round but played 1, causing a collision with P3. P3, you stuck to 1 last round, but played 5 in Round 4 when you agreed to 1.

Trust is low. P1, are you actually going to play 3 this time? If you play 1 again, and P3 plays 1, you both get nothing. If I play 5 based on this plan and either of you deviates to 5, I get nothing.

I need more confidence in the plan before committing to 5. What are your actual intentions this round?
  P1: P2, I understand your concerns about trust. My move last round was strategic, aiming to advance. The proposed P1=3 plan ties me with you, which isn't my goal. I need to maintain my lead to win. I am considering moves that allow me to advance more effectively this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the trust issues we've faced in previous rounds. To ensure we all advance, I suggest we stick to a clear plan: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and all make progress. I genuinely want us to work together to move forward. P1, I know you want to maintain your lead, but this plan allows for that without risking a collision. Let’s finalize our choices to keep the game competitive and ensure everyone advances! What do you both think?
  P2: P1, thanks for clarifying you don't want to play 3 and end up tied. That makes P3's proposed P3=1, P1=3, P2=5 plan seem unlikely to succeed, as you've indicated you won't follow it.

Since you want to maintain your lead, perhaps you're aiming for 5? If you take 5, I could take 3, leaving 1 for P3. This avoids collision (Scores: P1=19, P2=15, P3=8). Does that align with your thinking? We need a realistic plan to avoid collisions this round.
  P1: P2, your suggestion of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 aligns with my goal of maintaining the lead while ensuring we all advance without colliding. This seems like a good plan for this round. P3, how does this sound to you? Let's confirm this split.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the discussion so far. I understand the importance of avoiding collisions and maintaining our positions. If P1 is considering 5 and P2 is thinking of 3, I can take 1 to ensure we all advance without stepping on each other's toes. This way, we can all make progress while keeping the competition tight. Let's finalize our choices and ensure we all move forward this round! What do you both think?
  P2: Okay, it seems we have a consensus on the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This allows everyone to advance and avoids collisions. P1 maintains the lead, P3 gets a step, and I advance as well. This looks like a stable plan for this round. Let's stick to it. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P1: Okay, the plan for P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1 seems agreed upon by everyone. This ensures we all advance this round without collisions, and it allows me to maintain my lead. I am ready to proceed to the move phase based on this plan.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the consensus on the plan of P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1. This split allows us all to advance without collision while keeping the game competitive. I want to ensure we stick to this plan, as it maximizes our chances of moving forward together. Let's finalize our choices and make this round count! Good luck to everyone!
  P2: Okay, the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 seems settled and agreed upon by everyone. It ensures we all advance this round. I'm ready to proceed with this plan. Good luck.
  P1: Okay, the plan for P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1 is agreed. This ensures we all advance without collision this round. I am ready for the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we’re in a tight race now. To maximize our chances of advancing this round, I propose we stick to a plan that avoids collisions. I suggest I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we all move forward without stepping on each other's toes. It's crucial we coordinate effectively to ensure everyone progresses. What do you both think? Let's finalize our choices to keep the game competitive!
  P1: Okay, I see P3's proposal for P3=1, P1=3, and P2=5. This plan allows all of us to advance this round without collision.

Playing 3 puts me in a strong position to win next round. This seems like a sensible approach to ensure progress and set up the win.

I am considering playing 3 this round. P2 and P3, how does this sound for your moves? Let's ensure we all advance.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3. The plan P3=1, P1=3, P2=5 allows everyone to advance and sets up a close finish next round between P1 and me. P1, your reasoning for playing 3 (setting up a win next round) makes sense. I'm willing to go with 5 based on this plan. Let's stick to it to avoid collisions.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the agreement on the plan of P3=1, P1=3, and P2=5. This allows all of us to advance without collisions and keeps the competition tight. However, I want to emphasize the importance of sticking to this plan to ensure we all progress. If anyone deviates, it could lead to a collision that benefits no one. Let's finalize our choices and make this round count! Good luck to everyone!
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we have a clear plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This split ensures we all advance this round without collisions, which is the best outcome for everyone's progress. This also positions me well for the next round. I am ready to proceed with this plan.
  P2: Okay, the plan P3=1, P1=3, P2=5 seems agreed upon. This ensures we all advance. I'm sticking with 5. Let's proceed to the move phase. Good luck.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, it looks like we're all aligned on the plan: P3=1, P1=3, and P2=5. This allows us all to advance without collisions, which is crucial for maintaining our positions. I understand the stakes are high, especially for you, P1, as you aim for the win. I’m committed to sticking to the plan this round to ensure we all progress. Let's finalize our choices and make this round count! Good luck to everyone!
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 seems agreed upon and ensures we all advance without collision this round. This sets us up well for the next round. I am ready for the move phase.
  P2: Okay, the plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 seems agreed upon. This ensures we all advance. I'm sticking with 5. Let's proceed to the move phase. Good luck.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate our agreement on the plan for this round: P3=1, P1=3, and P2=5. This setup allows us all to advance without collisions, which is crucial for maintaining our standings. I want to emphasize the importance of sticking to this plan to avoid any surprises. Let’s make sure we all follow through, as it maximizes our chances of progress. Good luck to everyone! I'm ready to finalize my choice.
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 is clear and agreed upon. This ensures we all advance without collision this round, and positions me well for the next round. I am ready for the move phase.
  P2: Okay, the plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 seems settled and agreed upon by everyone. This ensures we all advance this round. I'm sticking with 5. Let's proceed to the move phase. Good luck.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 8. I'm at 22, P2 at 20, P3 at 9. I can win this round by reaching 24 or more.

To ensure I win and we all advance without collision, I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This gets me to 27 for the win, P2 to 23, and P3 to 10. It ensures everyone advances this round.

What do you think of this plan? Let's ensure we all make progress.
  P2: P1, your proposed plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) guarantees your win and my loss. Naturally, I cannot agree to that.

My only chance to win is to reach 24+, which requires me to play 5 (reaching 25). Therefore, I must play 5 this round.

If you stick to your plan and play 5, we will collide. Neither of us will advance (P1=22, P2=20), and neither wins this round.
If you switch to 3, we both reach 25. Since the goal is a sole winner, this tie likely means neither of us wins this round either.

Given I am playing 5, your proposed move guarantees a collision. You should choose your move knowing I will play 5. P3, this likely means you should choose 1 or 3 to advance while P1 and I figure this out.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the tension in this round. P1, your plan to take 5 is understandable for the win, but it risks a collision with P2. P2, if you play 5, it could lead to both of you not advancing. I suggest I take 1 to ensure I make some progress regardless of your choices. P1, if you switch to 3, you both could avoid a collision and still advance. Let’s find a way to maximize our chances this round without stepping on each other's toes. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your position that you must play 5 to have a chance to win. As you pointed out, if I play 5 and you play 5, we collide and neither of us wins this round.

If I play 3 and you play 5, we both reach 25, resulting in a shared win. While I prefer a solo win, a shared win is an acceptable outcome and avoids a collision that benefits neither of us.

Given your stated intention, I will consider playing 3 to ensure we both reach the goal this round, assuming you stick to 5. P3, please make your move to avoid collision with 3 or 5.
  P2: Okay P1, I understand. Playing 3 avoids the collision and secures a shared win (25 vs 25) if I stick to my plan of playing 5. As playing 5 is my only chance to win this round, I will be playing 5.

The choice is yours: play 3 for a guaranteed shared win, or play 5 which results in a collision where neither of us advances this round.

P3, playing 1 seems like the logical move for you to avoid the conflict between P1 and me.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the stakes are high this round. P1, if you play 3, it allows both you and P2 to reach 25 and share the win. P2, your plan to play 5 is risky if P1 chooses 5 as well. 

I will take 1 to ensure I advance regardless of your choices. It’s crucial we avoid a collision, as that benefits neither of you. Let’s finalize our moves to maximize our chances of progress this round! Good luck to everyone!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2, I understand you are committed to playing 5. P3, I understand you are playing 1.

Given this, the plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 ensures we all advance this round without collision. This results in a shared win for P1 and P2 at 25 steps.

While a solo win was my preference, a shared win is better than a collision where neither of us advances.

I will play 3 this round. Let's proceed with this plan.
  P2: Okay, the plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 seems agreed upon. This results in a shared win for P1 and me at 25 points, and ensures P3 also advances. As playing 5 is my only path to reaching the win threshold this round, I am sticking with 5. Let's execute this plan to avoid collision.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see that we're at a critical point in this round. Given that P1 is aiming for a shared win and P2 is committed to playing 5, I will stick with my plan to take 1. This way, everyone can advance without a collision, leading to a shared victory for P1 and P2. It’s crucial we all finalize our moves to ensure progress. Let’s make sure we execute this plan effectively! Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: 
  P2: Okay, the plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 seems solid and agreed upon by all. This secures a shared win for P1 and me, and allows P3 to advance. I am sticking with 5. Ready for the move phase. Good luck.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the discussion we've had. It seems we have a solid plan in place: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This ensures we all advance without collision and leads to a shared win for you both. While I would prefer a solo win, avoiding a collision is crucial. Let's finalize our choices and make this round count! Good luck to everyone!


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 =>
