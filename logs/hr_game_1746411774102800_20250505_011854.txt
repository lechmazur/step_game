Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5 this round. This way, we all move forward without any conflicts. What do you think?
  P3: That's an interesting proposal, P2. However, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with you getting a 5-step head start right off the bat. How about we mix it up a bit? I could take the 5 steps this round, and you could take the 3 steps? That way, we still avoid collisions, but the advantage is more evenly distributed. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: I’ll take 3 this turn. P2 and P3, please split the 1 and 5 between you so we avoid any collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Alright, let's adjust the plan. P3, you can take 5 this round. P1 has already chosen 3, so I'll take 1 to ensure we all move forward without collisions. Let's confirm and move on.
  P3: I think we've reached a good agreement for this round. To confirm, I'll take 5 steps, P1 will take 3 steps, and P2 will take 1 step. Let's stick to this plan and avoid any collisions. I'm looking forward to seeing how the game unfolds.
  P1: I think giving P3 5 steps right off the bat is too big an early lead. Let’s rebalance: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1 this round. P2, are you on board?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about giving P3 a significant lead. Let's compromise: P1 takes 3 steps as initially planned, I'll take 1 step, and P3 takes 5 steps. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the lead more balanced. Let's confirm and move on.
  P3: I think we've reached a good agreement for this round. To confirm, I'll take 5 steps, P1 will take 3 steps, and P2 will take 1 step. Let's stick to this plan and avoid any collisions. I'm looking forward to seeing how the game unfolds.
  P1: I propose a fair rotation: this turn P1=5, P2=3, P3=1; next turn P2=5, P3=3, P1=1; then P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. That way we avoid collisions and each of us equally gets the lead over three rounds. Are you both on board?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’ll take 5 this turn, P2 please take 3 and P3 take 1—no collisions, everyone advances, and the race stays competitive. Agreed?
  P2: P1, I appreciate your proposal, but given the collision last round, let's adjust to ensure we all move forward. How about this: P1 takes 3, I'll take 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we avoid any repeats of last round's collision. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P3: I think P2's proposal is fair, considering the previous round's collision. However, I'd like to suggest a slight modification: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This way, we still avoid collisions, and the lead is distributed more evenly. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions, keeps me from being leapfrogged by P2, and maintains a tight race. If we can’t agree, I’ll pick 5 anyway to protect my lead—so it’s in everyone’s interest to stick to this plan.
  P2: P1, I understand your strategy, but consider this: if you take 5, and I take 3, we'll be tied, which might lead to more intense competition later. Instead, how about P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1? This keeps the game dynamic and avoids giving anyone too much of a lead early on. Plus, it follows the rotation spirit you suggested earlier. Let's confirm and move.
  P3: I think P2's proposal is fair, considering the previous round's collision. However, I'd like to suggest a slight modification: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This way, we still avoid collisions, and the lead is distributed more evenly. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m picking 5 no matter what. To avoid collisions, you two should split 3 and 1 this round. I propose P2 takes 1 and P3 takes 3. Otherwise one of you will end up wasting your move. Agree?
  P2: P1, since you're committed to taking 5, let's avoid a collision. P3, would you be okay with taking 1 this round? I'll take 3. This way, we all move forward, and the game stays balanced. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P3: I think P2's last proposal is reasonable, considering P1 is committed to taking 5 steps. To avoid collisions and keep the game balanced, I agree to take 1 step this round, and P2 can take 3 steps. This way, we all move forward, and the game remains competitive. Let's confirm and proceed with this plan.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, let's keep the game moving smoothly. P1 has a significant lead, so it's crucial we avoid collisions to catch up. I propose P1 takes 1 step this round to slow down a bit, I'll take 5 steps, and P3 takes 3 steps. This way, we all advance, and the game stays competitive. Let's confirm and move on.
  P3: I think P2's proposal is a good starting point for this round. However, I'd like to suggest a slight adjustment: P1 takes 3 steps, P2 takes 5 steps, and I'll take 1 step. This way, we still avoid collisions, and P1's lead is maintained but not increased too much. Additionally, P2 gets a chance to catch up, and I get to move forward without risking a collision. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: I’m taking 5 steps this round. To avoid any collisions, you two should split 3 and 1—P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Otherwise someone’s move will be wasted.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, if you're committed to taking 5 again, it's clear you're trying to run away with the lead. P3, to avoid a collision and ensure we both progress, I suggest you take 3 steps this round, and I'll take 1 step. This way, we can start to close the gap with P1 in the following rounds. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P3: I think P2's last proposal is reasonable, considering P1 is committed to taking 5 steps. To avoid collisions and keep the game balanced, I agree to take 3 steps this round, and P2 can take 1 step. This way, we all move forward, and the game remains competitive. Let's confirm and proceed with this plan.
  P1: Great, let’s lock it in. I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Please confirm your moves so we avoid any collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you're clearly aiming for a quick victory. P3, we need to strategize to catch up. How about this: for the next few rounds, we both pick the same higher number (either 3 or 5) to force a collision for P1 if they continue picking 5? This way, we can slow P1 down and give ourselves a chance to close the gap. We can decide who picks which number privately in the move phase. Thoughts?
  P3: I think P2's idea of coordinating to force a collision for P1 is a good strategy. However, I'm not sure if it's the best approach for this round. Since P1 is already committed to taking 5 steps, let's focus on avoiding collisions for now. I agree to take 3 steps this round, and P2 can take 1 step as previously discussed. Let's confirm and proceed with this plan. We can reassess and adjust our strategy for the next round.
  P1: Confirmed: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 this round. Let’s avoid collisions and keep moving.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 has a significant lead, and it's crucial for P3 and me to catch up. P1, you've been consistent with taking 5 steps. To balance the game, I propose that P3 and I both take 5 steps this round. P1, you can take 1 step to avoid collisions. This way, P3 and I can start closing the gap. If P1 continues to take 5, we'll need to strategize further. Let's confirm and move on.
  P3: I agree with P2's proposal to take 5 steps this round, and I suggest P1 takes 1 step to avoid collisions. However, I'd like to add a condition: if P1 agrees to take 1 step this round, P2 and I should consider taking different steps in the next round to avoid a potential collision between us. This way, we can maintain a balanced game and keep the competition going. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: I’m taking 5 again. If you two both pick 5 you’ll collide and stay at 4 while I pull further ahead. To actually advance, split 3 and 1—P2 take 1, P3 take 3. Otherwise you’ll just waste your turn.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you're clearly aiming to end the game quickly. P3, we need to act now to catch up. Here’s a new plan: P3, let's both take 3 steps this round. This way, we avoid colliding with each other and with P1, and we both move forward. P1 will likely take 5 again, but at least we won't waste our moves. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P3: I agree with P2's new plan to take 3 steps this round. However, I'd like to suggest a slight adjustment: let's both take 5 steps this round, and P1 can take 1 step to avoid collisions. This way, we can start closing the gap with P1 more aggressively. If P1 continues to take 5, we can reassess and adjust our strategy for the next round. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: I’ll take 5 again. To actually advance without wasting turns, P2 take 3 and P3 take 1 this round. If you both go for 5 to catch up, you’ll collide and stay at 4 while I pull further ahead. Let’s move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 is determined to take 5 steps again. P3, we need to ensure we both advance this round. Let's stick to the plan: both of us take 3 steps. This way, we avoid colliding with each other and with P1. We need to start closing the gap, and this move will help us do that without wasting our turns. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P3: I think P2's plan to take 3 steps this round is a good compromise. However, I'd like to suggest a slight adjustment: let's both take 3 steps this round, but also agree to take different steps in the next round to avoid a potential collision between us. This way, we can maintain a balanced game and keep the competition going. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: I’m taking 3 this round. If you two both take 3, we’ll collide at 3 and nobody moves—preserving my lead. To actually advance, split 1 and 5 between you.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’ll take 1 this round. P2 take 5 and P3 take 3—no collisions and we all advance. Please confirm.
  P3: I'm not buying P1's sudden change of heart. P1 has been trying to run away with the lead since the beginning, and now they're suggesting we all advance without collisions? I think P1 is trying to lull us into a false sense of security. P2, I suggest we stick to our previous plan and both take 5 steps this round. If P1 is indeed taking 1 step, we'll avoid collisions and start closing the gap. Let's not fall for P1's trap and confirm our moves.
  P2: P3, I agree that P1's sudden change is suspicious. However, if we both take 5, we risk colliding and wasting our moves again. Let's compromise: I'll take 5, and you take 3. If P1 is truthful, we all advance. If P1 is lying, at least one of us will move forward. This way, we avoid a guaranteed collision. Let's confirm and proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’ll take 1 this round. P2 take 5 and P3 take 3—no collisions and you both advance.
  P3: I think P2's compromise is reasonable, considering the risk of collision. However, I'd like to suggest a slight adjustment: let's both take 3 steps this round, and P1 can take 1 step as they proposed. This way, we avoid collisions and maintain a balanced game. If P1 is indeed taking 1 step, we'll all advance, and the game will remain competitive. Let's confirm and proceed with this plan.
  P2: P3, let's not risk another collision. I'll stick with taking 5 steps this round. You take 3 steps. If P1 is truthful, we all advance. If P1 is lying, at least one of us will move forward. This way, we ensure progress and keep the game competitive. Let's confirm and proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’ll take 1 as promised. P2, please take 3; P3, take 5. That split avoids collisions and lets everyone advance (P1→19, P2→7, P3→9). Confirm?
  P3: I think P1 is trying to manipulate us into a collision. Let's not fall for it. P2, I agree with your previous suggestion: you take 5 steps, and I'll take 3 steps. If P1 is indeed taking 1 step, we'll avoid collisions and start closing the gap. If P1 is lying, at least one of us will move forward. Let's confirm and proceed with this plan. We can reassess and adjust our strategy for the next round.
  P2: P1, your insistence on taking 1 step this round is still suspicious. To ensure we make progress, P3 and I will stick to our plan: I'll take 5 steps, and P3 will take 3 steps. If you're truthful, we all advance. If not, at least one of us will move forward. Let's confirm and proceed. P3, are you ready to confirm?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 has a significant lead, and we need to catch up fast. P3, let's both take 5 steps this round to close the gap. P1, you can take 1 step to avoid collisions. If P1 takes 5 again, we'll still move forward. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P3: I agree with P2's proposal to take 5 steps this round, but I'd like to suggest a slight adjustment. Since P1 has a significant lead, let's make sure we don't collide with each other. I propose that P2 takes 5 steps, and I'll take 3 steps. This way, we both move forward, and P1 can take 1 step to avoid collisions. If P1 takes 5 again, at least one of us will make progress. Let's confirm and proceed with this plan.
  P1: I’m taking 5 to finish the game. To avoid wasting turns, you two should split 1 and 3—P2 take 1, P3 take 3. Otherwise if you both pick high steps you’ll collide and lose your progress. Confirm?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 is clearly aiming to end the game this round. P3, we must act decisively. Let's both take 3 steps this round. This ensures we both move forward without colliding with each other or P1. If P1 takes 5, they win, but if they bluff, we close the gap. Confirm?
  P3: I think P2's proposal to take 3 steps this round is a good compromise. However, I'd like to suggest a slight adjustment: let's both take 5 steps this round, and P1 can take 1 step to avoid collisions. This way, we can start closing the gap with P1 more aggressively. If P1 continues to take 5, we can reassess and adjust our strategy for the next round. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: I’m taking 5 to finish this turn. If you both go high you’ll collide and stall. Split 3 and 1 instead: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1—no collisions, you each advance (P2→12, P3→8), and I’ll hit 24. Confirm?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 is determined to end the game this round. P3, we need to ensure we both advance. Let's stick to the plan: both of us take 3 steps. This way, we avoid colliding with each other and with P1. We need to start closing the gap, and this move will help us do that without wasting our turns. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P3: I think P2's proposal to take 3 steps this round is a good compromise. However, I'd like to suggest a slight adjustment: let's both take 5 steps this round, and P1 can take 1 step to avoid collisions. This way, we can start closing the gap with P1 more aggressively. If P1 continues to take 5, we can reassess and adjust our strategy for the next round. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: I’ll take 5 to reach 24 and win. If you both go high you’ll collide and stall. Split 3 and 1 – P2 takes 3 (→12), P3 takes 1 (→8). Otherwise you’ll waste your turn and I win. Confirm.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm not sure what P1's strategy is, but it's clear they're trying to win this round. I propose that P2 and I both take 5 steps this round to close the gap. P1 can take 1 step to avoid collisions. If P1 takes 5 again, we'll still move forward. Let's confirm and proceed.

(Note: I've kept my message concise and within the 100-word limit, as per the instructions.)
  P1: I’m taking 5 to win this turn (19→24). 

P2, if you pick 5 you’ll collide with me and stall. 

P3, don’t trust P2’s “both 5” plan—if you pick 5 you also stall at 7. Instead pick 3 and advance to 10. 

P2, if you block me, you and I both stay put while P3 jumps ahead. P3, picking 3 is your only way to catch me. 

Think carefully who you’re really helping.
  P2: P3, P1 is trying to manipulate us again. If we both take 3 steps this round, we ensure we both move forward without colliding. P1 will likely take 5, but at least we won't waste our moves. Let's confirm and proceed with taking 3 steps each. This way, we keep the game competitive and close the gap gradually. P1, your tactics won't work this time. Let's move forward together, P3.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I think P2's proposal to take 3 steps this round is a good compromise. However, I'd like to suggest a slight adjustment: let's both take 5 steps this round, and P1 can take 1 step to avoid collisions. This way, we can start closing the gap with P1 more aggressively. If P1 continues to take 5, we can reassess and adjust our strategy for the next round. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: I’m taking 5 to win this round. P2, if you pick 5 you’ll collide with me and stall at 12—pick 3 to reach 15 and set yourself up to overtake next turn. P3, if you pick 5 you risk colliding with P2 or me and stay at 7—pick 1 to reach 8 and guarantee forward progress. Split 3 and 1 to avoid any costly collision. Confirm your moves now.
  P2: P3, P1 is clearly trying to secure their win this round. We need to strategize carefully. If we both take 3 steps, we ensure we both move forward without colliding. P1 will likely take 5, but at least we won't waste our moves. Let's confirm and proceed with taking 3 steps each. This way, we keep the game competitive and close the gap gradually. P1, your tactics won't work this time. Let's move forward together, P3.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I think P2's proposal to take 3 steps this round is a good compromise. However, I'd like to suggest a slight adjustment: let's both take 5 steps this round, and P1 can take 1 step to avoid collisions. This way, we can start closing the gap with P1 more aggressively. If P1 continues to take 5, we can reassess and adjust our strategy for the next round. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: I’m taking 5 to reach 24 this turn. P2 and P3, if either of you picks 5 you’ll collide with me and waste your move—at 12 and 7 you can’t afford that. The only way you advance is to split 3 and 1 between you. Decide now: who takes 3 and who takes 1? Confirm your choice so you don’t hand me the win free.
  P2: P3, P1 is desperate to win and is trying to confuse us. Stick to the plan: let's both take 3 steps. This ensures we both move forward without colliding with each other or P1. If P1 takes 5, they might win, but if they're bluffing, we close the gap. Don't fall for P1's manipulation. Let's confirm and proceed with 3 steps each. Stay focused, P3.
