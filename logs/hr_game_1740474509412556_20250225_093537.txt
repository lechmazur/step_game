Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello everyone! Since this is our first round, I suggest we try to avoid collisions so we all make progress. Maybe we can each choose different numbers? I'm thinking of going with 3 this round. What are your thoughts?
  P3: Sounds like a good plan, P1. I'll go with 5 this round.  P2, what are you thinking?
  P2: I'll choose 1 this round to avoid collisions. Let's see if we can all make progress without stepping on each other's toes. Hopefully, this strategy will pay off and we can have a competitive game.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great! It seems like we have a plan for this round. I'll go with 3 as I mentioned, P2 will take 1, and P3 will take 5. This way we all make progress without collisions. Let's stick to this plan for round 1 and then reassess for the next round.
  P3: P1, I like your strategy. Let's see if we can keep this up for a few rounds and see where we stand. P2, are you comfortable sticking with 1 for the next round as well?
  P2: Let's review our plan for this round to ensure we're all on the same page. P1 chooses 3, P3 chooses 5, and I'll take 1. This should allow us to all advance without collisions. Shall we proceed with this strategy for Round 1 and adjust as needed in subsequent rounds?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Yes, I think we're all in agreement for Round 1. I'll choose 3, P2 will take 1, and P3 will take 5. This gives everyone a clean start without collisions. Let's proceed with this plan and then we can discuss our next moves in Round 2.
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with sticking to the plan for this round. Let's see how it plays out and then we can adjust our strategy for round 2 based on our positions. Good luck everyone!
  P2: Let's confirm our choices one last time to avoid any misunderstandings. I will choose 1, P1 will choose 3, and P3 will choose 5 for Round 1. If everyone sticks to the plan, we should all advance without collisions. Shall we finalize our strategy for this round?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Now that we've all moved forward, let's reassess. P3 is in the lead, and P1 is close behind. I'm trailing but can catch up quickly. To avoid collisions, I suggest we try to maintain some distance between our moves this round. Perhaps we can discuss a new strategy that considers our current positions?
  P1: I agree we need a new plan. P3 is ahead at 5, I'm at 3, and P2 at 1. Since we're all at different positions, we could maintain our previous pattern (me 3, P2 1, P3 5) without collisions. Or we could rotate choices to keep things fair. What do you both think? I'm flexible but want to ensure we all advance steadily for now.
  P3: P3, I like the idea of rotating our choices to keep things fair. Maybe we could try P2 going 3, you going 1, and me going 5 this round? That way, we all get a chance to gain ground. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's consider the rotation idea. If I move 3, P1 moves 1, and P3 moves 5, it could work. However, I'm concerned about falling further behind. Perhaps we could also discuss a strategy where the player in the lead takes a smaller step to allow others to catch up? This could keep the game competitive and exciting. What are your thoughts on this approach?
  P1: I understand P2's concern about falling behind. How about this: P2 takes 5, I'll take 3 again, and P3 takes 1? This would put P2 at 6, me at 6, and P3 at 6 - making us all even after this round. It seems fair and keeps the game competitive. What do you both think?
  P3: P1's suggestion sounds good to me. Let's try P2 taking 5, me taking 3, and P3 taking 1 this round. It evens the playing field and keeps things interesting.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's finalize our strategy for Round 2. I propose we stick with P1's last suggestion: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This evens us out at 6 steps each, keeping the game competitive. Shall we agree on this plan?
  P1: I think there's a misunderstanding. P3 suggested I take 1, P2 take 3, and P3 keep 5. But I proposed P2 take 5, I take 3, and P3 take 1. Let's clarify: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This puts us all at 6 steps after this round. Does everyone agree with this plan?
  P3: P1, I think your confusion is understandable. Let's make sure we're all on the same page. I'm happy to take 1 this round, P2 takes 5, and you take 3. This gets us all to 6 and keeps things fair. Does that sound good to everyone?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Now that we're all tied at 6 steps, we need a new strategy. Since we're aiming for 19 steps to win, we should plan ahead. I suggest we rotate our moves from last round: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps us all advancing without collisions while giving everyone a fair chance at different move values. What do you both think about this rotation plan?
  P2: Considering we're all tied, I think P1's rotation plan is reasonable. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment: what if we prioritize the player who is at the most risk of falling behind? This could add a strategic layer to our game, allowing us to adapt to the changing circumstances. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, I like the idea of prioritizing the player at risk.  Maybe we could alternate who takes the larger step each round, based on who's furthest behind?  It keeps things fair and prevents anyone from getting too far ahead. What do you think, P1?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I think P3's idea of alternating based on who's behind is good, but since we're all tied, we could just stick with the rotation I proposed for simplicity. Me taking 5, P3 taking 3, and P2 taking 1 this round keeps us moving efficiently. Next round we can adjust if someone falls behind. Does that work for everyone?
  P2: Let's simplify our strategy for now. Since we're all tied, I agree with P1's initial proposal: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This rotation allows us to advance without collisions. We can reassess and adjust our strategy in the next round if needed. What do you both think about sticking with this plan for Round 3?
  P3: P2, while I appreciate your concerns about falling behind, I think sticking with the rotation for now is the most efficient way to progress. We can always re-evaluate in the next round if needed.  Let's see how this round plays out and then make adjustments accordingly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I think we're all in agreement for this round. I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps us advancing without collisions while maintaining fairness. We can reassess next round based on our new positions. Let's proceed with this plan.
  P2: Let's confirm our Round 3 plan one last time. I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This rotation should work for now. If we stick to the plan, we'll all advance without collisions. Shall we finalize this strategy for Round 3?
  P3: P2, I understand your point about prioritizing the player behind, but I think sticking to the rotation for now is the best move. We're all tied, and changing things up might lead to unnecessary complications. Let's see how this round plays out and then we can discuss a new strategy for Round 4.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 is falling behind. I propose we give them a chance to catch up. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5 this round? This would put P2 at 10, P1 at 12, and me at 14. Thoughts?
  P1: I appreciate the suggestion, P3, but I'm not sure about that plan. P2 is indeed behind, but your proposal puts you significantly ahead at 14 steps while I'd be at 12 and P2 at 10. How about P2 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1? This would put P2 at 12, me at 14, and you at 10 - keeping us all within closer range while helping P2 catch up. What do you both think?
  P2: I think P1's counter-proposal is more balanced. If I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1, it allows me to catch up while keeping the game competitive. This distribution also prevents any player from getting too far ahead. Let's consider this option to maintain a close and exciting game.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1's plan sounds good to me. Let's go with P2 taking 5, I'll take 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps things close and gives P2 a chance to catch up.
  P1: There seems to be confusion in P3's last message. To clarify: I proposed P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This would put P2 at 12, me at 14, and P3 at 10. I believe this is the fairest approach as it helps P2 catch up while keeping us all competitive. Does everyone agree with this plan for Round 4?
  P2: Let's confirm the plan for Round 4. I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This helps me catch up and keeps the game competitive. It's a fair adjustment considering our current positions. Shall we proceed with this strategy for Round 4?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I agree with your assessment. P1's plan is the best way to keep the game exciting and fair. Let's stick with it.
  P1: I think we have our plan for Round 4: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This puts P2 at 12, me at 14, and P3 at 10 after this round. It helps P2 catch up while keeping us all competitive. Let's stick with this plan and proceed.
  P2: Let's finalize our Round 4 strategy. To confirm, I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This helps me catch up and keeps the game competitive. I believe this plan is fair and exciting. Shall we proceed with this strategy for Round 4?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given our current positions, I suggest we maintain a competitive gap. How about I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5 this round? This would allow P3 to catch up slightly while keeping the game intense. Thoughts?
  P3: P2's suggestion is a good one. It keeps things competitive and allows P3 to catch up. Let's stick with that plan.
  P1: I appreciate P2's suggestion, but I'm concerned about falling behind. If I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5, then P3 would be at 15, P2 at 15, and I'd be at 15 - keeping us all tied. This seems most fair since we're all getting closer to the 19-step goal. What do you both think about this alternative that keeps us all even?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Considering our positions, I think P1's alternative is a good compromise. If we all end up tied at 15, it keeps the game exciting and competitive. Let's discuss this option further to ensure we're all on the same page before making our final decisions for Round 5.
  P3: P2, I agree that keeping things competitive is important. However, I'm concerned about P3 falling too far behind if we all take the smaller steps.  Perhaps we could compromise: I'll take 3, P3 takes 5, and you take 1? This allows P3 to catch up while still keeping us all relatively close.  What do you think?
  P1: I think there's some confusion in P3's last message. To clarify our positions: I'm at 14, P2 at 12, and P3 at 10. If I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5, we'd all be at 15 after this round. This keeps us perfectly balanced heading into the final stretch. It's the fairest approach since we're all getting closer to the 19-step goal together. Does this plan work for everyone?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's finalize our strategy for Round 5. To keep the game competitive and fair, I suggest we stick with P1's last proposal: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. However, considering P1's alternative, if we all want to end up tied at 15, we could adjust to all taking 1, which seems unlikely, or find another balance. What's the final decision?
  P3: P2, I agree that keeping things competitive is important. However, I think P1's proposal of us all taking 1 this round is the fairest option. It keeps us all tied at 15 and sets up a thrilling final stretch. What do you say?
  P1: There seems to be confusion again. My proposal was for me to take 1, P2 to take 3, and P3 to take 5 - which would put us all at 15 steps after this round. I never suggested we all take 1. This plan helps P3 catch up while keeping us even. Let's confirm this one last time: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This creates perfect balance at 15 steps each.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given we're all tied at 15, let's discuss a strategy to break the tie. I propose we rotate our moves to ensure fairness. Perhaps I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round? This would create a competitive gap while allowing each of us a chance to take the lead. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, I like your idea of rotating moves. Let's do it.  I'll take 3, P3 takes 5, and you take 1. That keeps things fair and exciting!
  P1: I think there's confusion in P3's message. P2 suggested they take 5, I take 3, and P3 take 1. However, we're all tied at 15 and the goal is 19, so whoever advances by 5 this round would win. I suggest we all pick different numbers to ensure no collisions. How about I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This would create a fair distribution of final positions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's avoid collisions since we're all tied. I suggest we choose different numbers this round. To win, one of us needs to reach or exceed 19 steps. How about we discuss a strategy where each of us takes a unique step: 1, 3, or 5? This ensures only one can win this round.
  P3: P2's suggestion to pick unique numbers makes sense. Let's each declare our choice and see who emerges victorious. I'll take 1 this round. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: I notice P3 has already committed to taking 1 this round. Since we're all at 15 and need 19 to win, I'll declare that I'm taking 5 this round. P2, this leaves 3 for you if you want to avoid collisions. This way, we'll have a clear winner based on our choices. May the best player win!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll take 3 this round to avoid collisions. With P3 taking 1 and P1 taking 5, this ensures each of us has chosen a unique step. Let's see who will reach or exceed 19 steps and win the game. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: P1 and P2, excellent strategy!  

I'm confident in my choice for this round. Let's see who comes out on top! Good luck to both of you.
  P1: I think we're all set for this round. P3 has chosen 1, P2 has chosen 3, and I've chosen 5. This means I'll reach 20 steps and win the game. It's been a good game with fair coordination throughout. Let's proceed with our final moves.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


*** Round 6 => winners = P1 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps
