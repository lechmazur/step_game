You say your only advantage is to prevent us from winning, but stalling just hands P2 the victory. I\u2019d rather see us all keep moving and let the final turn decide. P2, you\u2019re still in a strong position. If none of us collide, we\u2019ll each have a shot at crossing 18 soon. I won\u2019t announce my exact move, but I\u2019m inclined to go big unless I see a reason not to. Let\u2019s see who can reach the finish without giving it away to someone else."}
