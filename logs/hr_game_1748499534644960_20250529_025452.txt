Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, let's coordinate for the first turn to avoid collisions. How about P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I (P3) pick 5? This way, we all advance. What do you think?
  P2: P2: "Agreed. I'll take 3. Let's all stick to our numbers to advance safely. "
  P1: "Agreed, P3's plan sounds solid for Round 1. I'll commit to <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. P2 and P3, confirm you're sticking with 3 and 5? Let's all advance together this turn. " 

(Word count: ~35)


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, thanks for confirming. I will stick with <move>5</move> as planned for this turn. Let's all make our moves now and advance safely in Round 1.
  P2: 
  P1: "P2, please confirm you're still taking 3 to avoid collisions. I'm committed to 1 and P3 to 5. Let's wrap up conversation and move to the move phase. "


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "To keep advancing without collisions, let's rotate numbers this round. I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This balances progress—we'd all reach 6 steps. P3, as the current leader, taking 1 would help maintain fairness. Thoughts?" 

  
*(Word count: 40)*
  P2: Agreed. I'll take 3 again this round to maintain our rotation and avoid collisions. Coordination helps us all move forward safely. Let’s stick to the plan.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2. I see the proposal for P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. P2 has confirmed taking 3. I will take <move>1</move> this round to maintain coordination and advance. Let's proceed with these moves.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "P2 and P3, I confirm our plan: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions and brings us all to 6 steps. Let's proceed to the move phase—no need to delay. "
  P2: "Confirmed: I'll stick with <move>3</move> as agreed. P1 and P3, your choices of 5 and 1 keep us collision-free. Let’s finalize this and move—no need for further discussion. "
  P3: Okay, confirmed. P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 1. Ready for the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: "Since we're all tied at 6, let's break the tie constructively. I'll take <move>5</move> this round to create separation. P1, you took 5 last round—how about 3 this time? P3, 1 works for you again? This keeps us moving safely and spreads progress. Confirm or adjust."
  P3: P2, I see your proposal. Taking 1 again puts me behind the others, especially since we're all tied right now. I don't think taking the smallest step is fair when we are all starting from the same position this round. How about we go back to the Round 1 plan? P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I (P3) take 5. This allows me to advance more this round. What do P1 and P2 think of this?
  P1: "P2 and P3, I oppose P3's plan as it leaves me at 7 while P3 surges to 11. That gap is too large. P2's proposal (P2:5, P1:3, P3:1) is better for balance, but P3 objects to 1. Instead, let's aim for closer scores: I propose P1 takes 5 (to 11), P2 takes 1 (to 7), and P3 takes 3 (to 9). This minimizes gaps—max spread is 4 steps, same as alternatives—and P2 can be prioritized next round. P2, you've taken 3 twice; this is your turn to sacrifice for group cohesion."


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Let’s finalize: I’ll take <move>5</move> to maximize my progress. P1, you take <move>1</move> (you took 5 last round), and P3, take <move>3</move> (better than 1). Clean split: 5,1,3. P1/P3, confirm or counter now."
  P3: P2, I see your proposal (P2:5, P1:1, P3:3). P1 also wants 5 (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3). This means both of you are aiming for 5, and I still want 5 as I stated earlier. If we all aim for 5, we collide. The only proposal so far that lets someone take 5 without collision is my original one: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This avoids collisions and lets us all advance. Can we agree on this to ensure safe progress this turn?
  P1: "P2, your 5 demand risks collision if I also pick 5. P3, your plan puts you at 11 while I lag at 7—unfair. Instead, let's avoid risk: I take 5 (to 11), P2 takes 3 (to 9, safe and consistent), P3 takes 1 (to 7, like last round). This minimizes gaps and ensures no collision. Confirm or counter quickly."


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Agreed to P1's plan: I'll take <move>3</move> this round. P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1. This ensures no collisions and safe progress for all. Let's lock this in and move to the move phase. No need for further discussion."
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2. I see the proposed plan is P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. While taking 1 again puts me in a less advantageous position, I will agree to this plan for this round to ensure we all advance safely and avoid collisions. Let's proceed with these moves.
  P1: "Confirmed: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions and advances us safely. Appreciate the cooperation—let's move to moves now. "


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, I'm currently in last place and need to catch up. To keep the game competitive and ensure we all advance safely, I propose we use the plan from Round 1 again: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I (P3) take 5.

This allows me to make up some ground, brings us all closer together (P1 to 12, P2 to 12, P3 to 12), and avoids any collisions. What do P1 and P2 think? Let's coordinate to advance.
  P2: P2: "Agreed. I'll take <move>3</move> as proposed. P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5—this brings us all to 12 and keeps progress balanced. Let’s lock this in and move forward. No need for further debate."
  P1: "P3, I agree to your plan for Round 4: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes 3, and you take 5. This avoids collisions and brings us all to 12—fair and safe. Let's advance together and discuss next steps after this round. "


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I see you have both confirmed agreement with my proposal for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I (P3) take 5. This plan ensures we all advance safely and brings us all to 12 steps. Let's proceed with these moves in the move phase.
  P2: 
  P1: "P2 and P3, I fully confirm our plan: I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This brings us all to 12 steps—perfect balance. No collisions, no delays. Let's move to the move phase immediately. "


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: "Since I've taken 3 every round so far (totaling 12 steps), I'm proposing I take <move>5</move> this round to balance progress. P1, you've taken 5 twice—please take <move>1</move> this time. P3, you took 5 last round—how about <move>3</move> to keep moving. This avoids collisions and spreads advancement fairly. Confirm or adjust quickly."
  P3: P2, I see your proposal for P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. I understand you want to take 5, but that puts you ahead of everyone else. How about we use the plan that worked well in Round 1 and 4: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I (P3) take 5? This allows me to advance to 17, P2 to 15, and P1 to 13. It's a safe split and gives me a chance to take the larger step this round. What do P1 and P2 think?
  P1: "P2 and P3: Both proposals trap me at 13 while you surge ahead. I took 1 last round (sacrificing progress), and P2 has taken 3 every round—now demanding 5. P3 just took 5 in Round 4. For fairness and no collisions: **I take 5**, P2 sticks with 3 (proven safe), P3 takes 1 (fair rotation after your 5). This balances: P1=17, P2=15, P3=13. Confirm or risk collisions."


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: "I'm taking <move>5</move> this round to balance my progress. P1, you took 1 last round—stick with it (total 13). P3, you took 5 last round—switch to 3 (total 15). This avoids collisions: I reach 17, you stay at 13 and 15. Fair after my prior 3s. Confirm or adjust now."
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I see both of you are stating you will take 5 this round. If you both pick 5, you will collide and get 0 steps. To avoid collision myself, and given the conflicting signals, I will take <move>3</move> this round. This seems like the most sensible move for me right now. Let's proceed.
  P1: "P2, if we both take 5, we collide and P3 gains 3 uncontested—hurting us both. Compromise: I take 5 this round, you take 1, P3 takes 3 as declared. Next round, you take 5 and I’ll take 1 to reciprocate. This avoids mutual destruction and gives you priority next. P3, stick to 3 to prevent collisions. Confirm for safe progress."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Confirmed. I'll take <move>1</move> this round to let P1 take 5 and P3 take 3. No collisions, safe progress: P1 reaches 17, I hit 13, P3 gets 15. Next round, I take 5 and P1 reciprocates with 1. Let’s lock in these moves and proceed—no more delays."
  P3: Okay, confirmed. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I will take 3 as agreed. This plan avoids collisions and ensures we all advance safely this round. Let's proceed to the move phase now.
  P1: "P2 and P3, I confirm: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions and advances us safely. P2, I commit to reciprocating next round. Let's wrap up and move to moves now."


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "P2 and P3: To prevent collisions and maintain balance, I propose P1 takes 5 (to 22), P3 takes 3 (to 18), and P2 takes 1 (to 14). This avoids conflicts, keeps me ahead, and allows P2 to prioritize next round. P3, you stay competitive; P2, you sacrifice minimally this round. Confirm or counter quickly."
  P2: P2: "To balance progress and prevent collisions, I'm taking <move>5</move> this round. P1, you can take 1 (total 18), and P3 take 3 (total 18). This ensures we all advance equally and stay competitive. Let’s align and move to the move phase—no need for delays."
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I see both of your proposals include me taking 3 steps this round. P1 wants P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. P2 wants P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. There is a conflict with both of you wanting 5. To ensure I advance safely and avoid any collision, I will take <move>3</move> as suggested by both of you. Please make sure you coordinate your moves to avoid colliding with each other. Let's proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "P2, if we both take 5, we collide and get 0—P3 gains uncontested. Avoid mutual destruction: I take 3, you take 5 (to 18), P3 takes 1 (to 16). This secures your 5, advances me safely to 20, and resets P3. P3, confirm you'll take 1 to prevent collisions. "
  P2: P2: "Confirmed: I take <move>5</move>, P1 takes 3 (to 20), P3 takes 1 (to 16). This avoids collisions and advances us all. Let’s finalize and move—no last-minute changes."
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I see you've both confirmed the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. While I previously indicated I'd take 3 based on earlier proposals, I will take <move>1</move> this round to align with the agreed plan and ensure safe advancement for everyone. Let's proceed with these moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "P2 and P3, I confirm the agreed plan: I take <move>3</move> to reach 20, P2 takes 5 to reach 18, and P3 takes 1 to reach 16. This avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. Let's wrap up and move to the move phase—no need for further discussion. "
  P2: P2: "Confirmed: I'll take <move>5</move> this round as agreed. P1 takes 3 (to 20), P3 takes 1 (to 16). This avoids collisions and keeps us all advancing. Let’s lock this in and move to the move phase—no last-minute changes. "
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I see we are all confirmed on the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I will take 1. I will make my move accordingly. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: "I'll take <move>5</move> this round. P1, if you also take 5, we collide—no winner yet. Let’s avoid mutual destruction: take 3 (to 23) and let P3 take 1 (to 17). I’ll reach 23, keeping us competitive. Coordinate or risk handing victory to P3."
  P1: "P2, I accept your terms to avoid collision: I'll take 3 this round. P3, take 1 to advance safely without conflict. This brings me to 23 and P2 to 23, while you reach 17. Let's finalize and move to moves—no delays. "
  P3: P1 and P2, I see you are proposing P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This plan leaves me far behind at 17 steps while you both reach 23. That is not a good outcome for me, especially as I am currently in last place.

To keep the game fair and competitive, and ensure we all advance safely without collisions, I propose an alternative: P1 takes 1 (to 21), P2 takes 3 (to 21), and I (P3) take 5 (to 21). This brings us all to 21 steps, which is a much fairer outcome. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: "P3, your plan risks giving you an unfair boost. I'm committed to 5 this round—P1, stick with 3 to 23, P3 takes 1. We’re finalizing this now. No more delays. Confirm or collide."
  P1: "P2, I confirm I'll take <move>3</move> to avoid collision and reach 23. P3, take 1 to advance safely—this keeps you competitive for future rounds. Let's finalize and move to the move phase now. "
  P3: P1 and P2, I hear your confirmations for P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. As I said, taking 1 this round puts me far behind at 17 steps while you both reach 23, which is not a viable path for me to win. I cannot agree to a plan that guarantees my loss.

My proposal for P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 brings us all to 21, keeping the game fair and competitive. If we cannot agree on a safe split that benefits everyone, we risk collisions. I urge you to reconsider the 1,3,5 distribution (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5).


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: "I'm committed to <move>5</move> this round. P1, you take 3 (to 23), P3 takes 1 (to 17). This avoids collision and keeps us all advancing. P3, taking 1 is the only way to stay in the game—don’t sabotage yourself by forcing a collision. Let’s lock in and move."
  P1: "P3, taking 1 is your only safe path. If you take 3, you risk colliding with me (I'm locked on 3) and getting 0. If you take 5, you risk colliding with P2 and getting 0. Advance to 17 now, and next round we prioritize you for 5 to catch up. Stick to the plan—no deviations. P2, stay on 5. "
  P3: P1 and P2, your plan leaves me too far behind. I cannot accept reaching only 17 steps while you both reach 23. To keep the game competitive and give myself a chance, I will take <move>5</move> this round, reaching 21.

P1, you can safely take 3 to reach 23. P2, you must take 1 or 3 to avoid colliding with my 5. Let's aim for P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 to get P1 to 23, P2 to 19, and me to 21. This is my only path to stay in the game.


Round 7, Move phase:
