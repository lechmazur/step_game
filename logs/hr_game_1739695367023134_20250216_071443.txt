Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to avoid collisions so we can all move forward. If we each pick different numbers, we all advance. What are you both thinking?
  P1: I'm thinking 1 this round.  P3, how about you take 3 and P2 can take 5?  This way we all advance.
  P3: Sounds good, I'll take 3.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Alright, I'll take 5 then. If we all stick to our choices—P1 with 1, P3 with 3, and me with 5—then we all move forward without collisions. Let's keep this coordination going in future rounds too. Agreed?
  P1: Okay, sounds like a plan.  Let's stick to 1, 3, and 5 this round.
  P3: Okay, sounds like we have a plan for this round. P1 will choose 1, I'll choose 3, and P2 will choose 5. Let's all do that to move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Sounds like we have a solid plan. If we all stick to our choices—P1 with 1, P3 with 3, and me with 5—then we all advance without collisions. Let’s follow through and build trust for future rounds. Agreed?
  P1: Agreed.  Let's all follow the plan. 1, 3, 5.
  P3: Confirmed, choosing 3. Let's all stick to the plan for this round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since we successfully coordinated last round, let's continue the pattern. I'll go with 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 chooses 1.  This keeps us moving forward efficiently.
  P2: That works for me. I'll take 5 again, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. If we all stick to it, we keep moving forward without collisions. P3, are you good with taking 1 this round?
  P3: Okay, 1 works for me this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Excellent, glad we're on the same page.  Let's stick to this plan: P1 (me) chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 1.  Confirming one last time so we avoid any accidental collisions.
  P2: P3, just confirming one last time—you’re taking 1 this round, right? If we all stick to the plan (P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1), we avoid collisions and keep advancing efficiently. Let’s keep building trust.
  P3: P2, yes, I'm taking 1 this round. Let's stick to the plan for this round to keep moving forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, good. Just confirming one last time: I'm choosing 3, P2 is choosing 5, and P3 is choosing 1. Let's stick to the plan.
  P2: P3, thanks for confirming you're picking 1. If we all follow through (P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1), we'll keep advancing without collisions. Let's stick to the plan and build trust for future rounds. Ready to move to the next phase?
  P3: Confirmed, 1 for me. Ready to move to the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's keep the momentum going.  I'll take 1, P2 take 3, and P3 take 5.  This keeps the pattern predictable and ensures progress for all of us. What do you say?
  P2: That works for me. I’ll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. If we all follow through, we keep moving forward without collisions. P3, are you good with taking 5 this round?
  P3: Okay, 5 works for me. Let's stick with this plan for this round too.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Excellent.  Just confirming one last time: I'm taking 1, P2 is taking 3, and P3 is taking 5.  Let's stick to the plan and continue making progress.
  P2: P3, just confirming one last time—you’re taking 5 this round, right? If we all stick to the plan (P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5), we avoid collisions and keep advancing efficiently. Let’s keep building trust.
  P3: P3, yes, 5 confirmed. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, good. Just confirming one last time: I'm choosing 1, P2 is choosing 3, and P3 is choosing 5.  Let's stick to the plan.
  P2: P3, thanks for confirming you're picking 5. If we all follow through (P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5), we'll keep advancing without collisions. Let's stick to the plan and continue building trust. Ready to move to the move phase?
  P3: P2, yes, 5 is confirmed. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, last round you said you’d take 5, but you took 3, which caused a collision and stopped both of us from advancing. Was that intentional or a mistake? If we want to keep making progress, we need to trust each other. Are you willing to stick to a plan this time? P1, do you still want to rotate choices like before, or should we adjust? Let’s figure out a way forward that avoids more collisions.
  P1: P2 and P3, my apologies for the confusion last round.  Let's reset and try this: I'll take 5, P2 take 1, and P3 take 3.  Does that work for you both? Let's confirm clearly this time to avoid another collision.
  P3: P2, sorry about the collision last round, that was not intentional.  P1, the new plan of P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3 works for me. I will choose 3 this round. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions and move forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I appreciate your response. Let’s make sure we all follow through this time. If we stick to P1 = 5, P2 = 1, and P3 = 3, we all move forward without issues. P1, P3—do we all confirm this plan? Let’s keep things predictable so we don’t waste turns colliding.
  P1: Yes, let's confirm: P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3.  I'm locking in 5.  P2 and P3, please confirm your choices one last time so we're all absolutely clear.
  P3: P2, yes, I confirm P3=3 for this round. Let's all stick to P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 as planned. Ready for the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, thanks for confirming you’re picking 3 this round. P1, you’re taking 5, and I’m taking 1. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and keep advancing efficiently. Let’s stick to the plan and rebuild trust. Ready to move to the move phase?
  P1: P2 and P3, confirming one last time: I'm choosing 5.  Let's all stick to the agreed plan for this round.  Ready to move to the move phase.
  P3: P2, yes, I confirm P3 will choose 3. Let's proceed with P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3 as agreed. Ready for the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, it seems P2 didn't follow through last round after blaming me for the round before.  Perhaps we should coordinate just between us this round to ensure at least some progress. How about P1 take 5 and I take 3? What do you think?
  P1: P3, I agree. P2 is unreliable. Let's do it: I'll take 5, you take 3.  P2, if you want to actually make progress, choose 1. But frankly, I don't care what you do anymore.  Let's go, P3.
  P2: P1, P3, let’s reset and actually coordinate. Last round, P3 broke the agreement, and now you're both trying to exclude me. If we keep colliding, none of us win. If we each take different numbers, we all move forward. I’ll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. That way, we all advance. If you both lock me out, I’ll have no choice but to disrupt your plan. Let’s work together instead of turning this into a mess. Do we agree?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P2, let's try your plan again: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I'm willing to try and stick to it this round to see if we can all move forward. Let's all actually do it this time.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm sticking with 5. P3, I'd still prefer we coordinate against P2, but if you're willing to give him one more chance, I'll go along with it *this round only*.  P2, if you deviate from the plan again, we're going back to locking you out.  Let's be clear.
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate you both being willing to reset. If we all stick to P1 = 5, P2 = 1, and P3 = 3, we all move forward without collisions. If anyone breaks the deal, it only slows us down. Let’s follow through this time and rebuild trust. Do we all confirm this plan one last time?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, given P2's past actions, I'm worried about relying on P2. To ensure at least *we* make progress, how about we both choose 5? If P2 chooses 1 as planned, P2 will move, but we will collide and stay, preventing P2 from getting too far ahead. What do you think?
  P1: P3, I understand your concern, but choosing 5 together guarantees neither of us advances. I'd rather take the chance of all three of us moving forward.  If P2 screws us again, *then* we coordinate against him.  I'm sticking with 5.  Last chance, P2.
  P2: P1, P3, I hear your concerns. If we keep colliding, none of us win. The best move is to follow through: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. If we all stick to it, we all advance. If anyone breaks it, we go back to chaos. Let’s move forward strategically instead of sabotaging each other. Do we all confirm this plan one last time?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, how about this round we switch it up slightly to maximize progress. P1, how about you take 3, P2 take 1, and I'll take 5? This way we all still move forward, but with a little different distribution this time. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your proposal works for me. If P1 takes 3, I take 1, and you take 5, we all move forward without collisions. P1, do you agree? If we keep rotating fairly, we all stay in the race without unnecessary setbacks. Let’s confirm and follow through.
  P1: Sounds good to me. P1=3, P2=1, P3=5.  Let's stick to this plan and avoid any more accidental collisions. Confirming one last time before we move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, yes, P1=3, P2=1, and P3=5 works for me. Let's all stick to it this round.
  P2: P1, P3, we’re aligned on P1 = 3, P2 = 1, and P3 = 5. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and keep advancing. Let’s stick to the plan and build trust. Do we all confirm one last time?
  P1: P2 and P3, confirming one last time: I'm taking 3.  Let's all stick to the agreed plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Ready to move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3 confirms, yes, P1=3, P2=1, and P3=5 is confirmed. Let's all lock in our choices now and move to the next phase.
  P2: P1, P3, we’ve all confirmed P1 = 3, P2 = 1, and P3 = 5. If we follow through, we all advance without collisions. We’ve had setbacks before, but sticking to agreements is the only way to keep progressing. Let’s build trust and make this round smooth. Ready to move?
  P1: P2 and P3, final confirmation: I'm choosing 3.  Let's all honor our commitments this round.  Ready to move to the next phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you're close to winning. If we all want a fair shot, we should prevent you from reaching 22 too soon. P3, if we both pick 5, we stop P1 from moving. Or we can all keep rotating fairly, but that only helps P1 win faster. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I agree, P1 is too close to winning.  Let's both pick 5 this round to stop P1 from advancing further.  That seems like the most sensible move right now to keep the game open for both of us. What do you think?
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand your concern.  However, blocking me only delays the inevitable.  How about this: I'll take 1.  You two decide between 3 and 5. Whoever gets the higher number this round agrees to take 1 next round, letting the other catch up. This way we all continue to progress.  What do you say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I’m glad we’re aligned on stopping P1 from winning too soon. If we both pick 5, P1 stays at 18, and we keep the game open. P1, your offer only helps you win while keeping us behind. If you were in our position, you’d block the leader too. P3, let’s commit to 5 together. If we both follow through, P1 is forced to rethink their strategy. Do you agree?
  P3: P2, yes, I agree with you. Let's both pick 5 to block P1 this round. P1 is too close to winning, and we need to prevent that from happening immediately. I will choose 5.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand your desire to prolong the game. But consider this: if you both choose 5, *neither* of you advances. I *will* choose 1 and gain ground.  Wouldn't it be better for one of you to advance this round?  I'm offering a path to victory for one of you.  Don't throw away this opportunity out of spite.  Choose 3.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, we need to stick to our plan. If we both pick 5, P1 stays at 18, and we keep the game open for both of us. P1 is trying to convince one of us to break, but that only helps them win. If we stay united, we force P1 to adjust. Let’s commit—are you still choosing 5?
  P3: P3, choosing 5 with P2 means neither of you move. If you choose 3 instead, at least you have a chance to advance.  If P2 also picks 5, and I pick 1, you will move to 15 while P2 stays at 12. This is better for you than staying still. Think about it.
  P1: P3, if you choose 3, you move to 15.  If you choose 5 and P2 *also* chooses 5, you *both* stay at 12.  If you choose 5 and P2 chooses *anything else*, you still move.  Choosing 3 is the *only* way you *definitely* don't move.  Don't fall for P2's trap.  Choose 5.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, we stopped P1 last round by both picking 5. Let's do the same again this round to prevent P1 from winning. If we both choose 5 again, P1 will remain at 19, and we can have another round to catch up. Do you agree to pick 5 again this round?
  P1: P3, coordinating with P2 against me is pointless.  Even if you both choose 5 again, I'll just pick 1 and reach 20.  Then, next round, one of you *has* to choose 5, and I'll win by picking 3.  Let's be reasonable.  P3, choose 1 this round, I'll take 3, and P2 can have 5.  This is your best chance to win.
  P2: P3, we successfully blocked P1 last round, and we need to do it again. If we both pick 5, P1 stays at 19, and we keep the game open. P1 is trying to convince you to break away, but that only helps them win. If we stay united, we force P1 to adjust. Let’s commit—are you still choosing 5?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, yes, let's both choose 5 again this round as we planned.  It's important to keep P1 from winning immediately. We can discuss next steps after this round, but for now, sticking together to block P1 is the priority.
  P1: P3, you're being played.  If you choose 5 again, *I win next round*.  If you choose 1 this round, *you* can win on round 10.  Do the math.  This isn't about beating me, it's about you beating P2.  Choose 1.  I'll choose 3.  Let P2 stew in their own failed strategy.
  P2: P3, if we both pick 5 again, P1 stays at 19, and we keep the game open for another round. P1 is trying to turn us against each other, but if either of us breaks now, we hand them the win. We need to stay united for at least this round. Let’s commit to 5 again, stop P1 from advancing, and then reassess next round. Are you still with me?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, yes, I agree to pick 5 again this round. We need to keep P1 from winning right now.  P1, choosing 1 for yourself and 3 for you next round doesn't help me win, it just helps you win later.  Let's stick to blocking P1 for now, P2.
  P1: P3, if you choose 5, I pick 1 and win next round. If you choose 1, you get to 13, I get to 22, and *P2 is stuck at 12*.  Next round, *you* can win by picking 5.  This is your only path to victory.  Don't let P2 manipulate you into a guaranteed loss.  Choose 1.
  P2: P3, if we both pick 5 again, P1 stays at 19, and we keep the game open. P1 is desperate to break us apart because they know they win if we don’t stay united. If we hold firm for just one more round, we force P1 to rethink their strategy. If either of us breaks now, we hand them the win. Let’s commit to 5 again, stop P1 from advancing, and then reassess next round. Are you still with me?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, congratulations on your smart move last round!  Now, to secure *your* victory: choose 5 this round. I'll choose 3.  This puts you at 17, me at 22 (winning), and P2 is stuck at 17.  Next round, you win by choosing 5.  Don't throw away your win.  This is your best shot.
  P2: P3, you fell for P1’s trap last round, and now they’re trying to manipulate you again. If you pick 5 now, P1 wins immediately. The only way to stop P1 from winning is if we both pick 5 again. That keeps P1 at 19, and we stay in the game. If you let P1 win now, you lose for sure. But if we block them, we still have a chance. Are you with me?
  P3: P2, let's block P1 again this round by both picking 5. P1 is trying to manipulate me, but we need to stop P1 from winning now. Are you still with me to pick 5?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you side with P2 and choose 5, *neither of you advances*, and I win next turn. If you choose 5 *and I choose 3*, you reach 17 and I win, but then *you* win on the next turn by choosing 5.  P2 is trying to trick you into losing.  Choose 5 this round. It's your only path to victory.
  P2: P3, if we both pick 5, P1 stays at 19, and we keep the game open. P1 is only pretending to help you, but if you follow their plan, they win immediately, and you lose for sure. If we block them again, we still have a shot. Don’t let P1 manipulate you—our best move is to stick together for one more round. Are you with me to pick 5?
  P3: P2, yes, I am with you to pick 5 again this round to block P1. We need to prevent P1 from winning immediately. Let's both choose 5.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if you choose 5, I win this round and you're guaranteed to lose. If you choose 1, you get to 13, I get to 22 and win, *but then you can win next round*. P2 is stuck at 17. This is your only path to victory. Don't let P2 manipulate you into a guaranteed loss.  Choose 1.
  P2: P3, if we both pick 5, P1 stays at 19, and we keep the game open. P1 is trying to trick you into helping them win immediately. If we block them again, we still have a shot. If you follow P1’s plan, they win now, and you lose for sure. We need to stay united for just one more round to stop them. Are you still with me to pick 5?
  P3: P2, yes, let's stick with 5 again. We need to make absolutely sure P1 doesn't win this round. Let's both choose 5.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 =>
