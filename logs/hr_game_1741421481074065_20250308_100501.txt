Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I suggest we each pick distinct numbers this turn to maximize progress. I'll choose 5. Please take 1 or 3 so we all advance without collision. Let’s collaborate to move forward efficiently.
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to avoid collisions, but I won't reveal my choice yet. P3, will you follow P1's advice and choose 1 or 3? Let's see if we can indeed collaborate for now.
  P3: Sounds reasonable.  I'll take 3.  P2, please choose 1.  Let's avoid collisions for now and see how the game progresses.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if you take 1 as agreed, we’ll all move forward this turn: I’ll take 5, P3 takes 3. No collisions. Let’s honor this plan—collaboration ensures progress. Any last objections?
  P2: I'll take 1 as suggested, to avoid collisions and ensure progress for all. Let's keep the collaboration going for now and see how it plays out. No need for further discussion, I'm ready to move forward with our agreed plan.
  P3: Okay, I'm sticking with 3. P1 and P2, please confirm you're still choosing 5 and 1 respectively.  Let's make this first turn smooth and efficient.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: To maintain momentum, I'll take 5 again. Let’s adjust roles: P2, take 3 to catch up, and P3, take 1 this round. This ensures no collisions and balanced progress. Confirm?
  P3: I'm not comfortable consistently taking the smallest step.  How about this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 this round.  Then we rotate next round. This way we all advance and the point spread stays relatively even.
  P2: I think P3's suggestion has merit. Rotating steps could keep the game balanced. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment: let's agree on the rotation but also consider the current score gap. Perhaps we can discuss a compromise that allows P1 to take a smaller step this round to prevent them from getting too far ahead.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Collaboration is key, but consistency minimizes collision risks. This round, I’ll take 5 again to maintain momentum. P2, please take 3 to bridge the gap, and P3, 1 ensures you advance without conflict. Rotating now risks misalignment—let’s stick to the tested plan. Confirm and move?
  P3: I understand the concern about P1 getting too far ahead. How about this: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This allows P1 to still advance significantly while allowing P2 and me to catch up slightly.  This keeps the game interesting and avoids large point disparities early on.  Let's try this for this round.
  P2: I think we've discussed enough. P3's last suggestion seems reasonable, but I'm not committed to any choice yet. Let's end the conversation and make our moves. I'm ready to proceed with the game.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: To avoid last-minute chaos, let’s stick with the initial plan. I’ll take **5** again to maintain momentum. P2, please confirm you’ll take **3**, and P3, **1** ensures your safe progress. Rotating risks misalignment—collisions could strand us all. Proceed with the tested strategy. Final confirmation?
  P3: P1, your insistence on 5 is making me suspicious.  I'm going with 5.  P2, if you want to move, choose 1 or 3.  Let's see what P1 *actually* does.
  P2: Given the recent developments, I'm reconsidering my strategy. P3's decision to take 5 has introduced unpredictability. To minimize collision risk, I suggest we reassess our moves. If P1 indeed takes 5 as stated, and P3 also takes 5, I'll choose 1 to ensure some progress. Let's end the speculation and make our moves.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: To maximize progress, let’s each pick distinct numbers again. I’ll choose 5. P3, please take 3; P2, 1. This ensures we all advance without collision. Confirm?
  P3: P1, I'm not falling for that again.  Since you lied last round, trust is gone.  I'm going for 5. P2,  choose 1 or 3 to advance. Let's see if P1 is bluffing *this* time.
  P2: Given the broken trust and current standings, I suggest a more cautious approach. P1 and P3, considering your history, I'll choose 1 to ensure progress, avoiding potential collisions. Let's see if we can still find a way to advance without further deception.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: P3, I'll take 3 to avoid clashing with your 5. P2, your 1 ensures safe progress. Let’s finalize this plan to advance without collision.
  P3: P1, taking 3 now after calling 5 initially seems like another attempt to mislead. I'm sticking with 5.  P2, I advise against 1. If P1 *does* take 3, you'll be stuck. Consider 3 yourself.  Let's see who's bluffing now.
  P2: Given the distrust and P3's decision to take 5, I'll consider taking 3 to avoid potential collisions and ensure progress. P1, if you indeed take 3 as recently stated, and P3 takes 5, I'll choose 3. Let's minimize risks and see who advances. P3, are you committed to 5 regardless of our choices?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, take 1 to ensure progress. I’ll take 3, and P3 can safely choose 5. This avoids collisions and lets all advance. Trust is fragile, but stagnation benefits no one. Confirm and proceed.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm locking in 5.  The constant shifting and deception isn't productive.  If you both want to move, one of you take 1 and the other take 3.  Let's see who's actually committed to collaboration and who's just playing mind games.
  P2: Given the distrust and P3's commitment to 5, I'll take 3 to minimize collision risk and ensure some progress. P1, your actions will determine the outcome. If you take 3 as stated, we'll collide. I'm proceeding with caution, prioritizing advancement over potential deception. Let's end the conversation and make our moves.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given P3's lead and P1's recent unpredictable behavior, I suggest we focus on not letting P3 extend their lead. P1, consider taking 1 to avoid collision with P3's likely choice of 5. I'll take 3, ensuring some progress without directly competing with P3. Let's contain P3's advancement and reassess our strategies in the next round.
  P3: P3: I'm sticking with 5.  The only way I lose is if you two coordinate against me.  P2, if you take 3, and P1 takes 1, I'll win next round. If you both chase me with 5, we all lose.  Let's see how much you *actually* want to collaborate.
  P1: P2, let’s split 1 and 3 to avoid blocking P3’s 5. I’ll take **3** to gain ground, and you take **1**. This keeps us advancing without collision. P3, your 5 won’t leave you too far ahead—next round we can push harder. Deal?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, considering our positions, I propose a temporary alliance to contain P3's lead. P1, if you take 1 and I take 3, we can limit P3's advancement. P3, taking 5 won't guarantee a win if we coordinate effectively. Let's reassess our strategies and proceed with caution.
  P3: P2, I appreciate the sentiment, but I'm going for the win, not a coalition.  I'm sticking with 5.  If you truly want to stop me, *both* of you need to choose 5.  Otherwise, I'll likely win next round.  The choice is yours.
  P1: P1: P2, let’s split 5 and 3 to block P3’s 5. I’ll take **5**, forcing P3 to pivot, while you take **3** to gain ground. If P3 stays at 5, they collide with me and stall. We can both advance while limiting their progress. P3, your move is predictable—time to disrupt it. Confirm?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll take 5 to directly compete with P3, attempting to stall their progress. P1, if you take 3 as previously suggested, we can limit P3's advancement and reassess our strategies. Let's proceed with a competitive approach to contain P3's lead.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm locking in 5.  Stop pretending you'll cooperate to block me. If you were serious, you'd both choose 5 *right now*.  But you won't. One of you will try to advance, and I'll win next turn.  This charade is over.
  P1: P2, I'll take 3 to advance to 12. Take 5 to block P3's move—colliding with them stalls their progress. P3, your fixation on 5 is predictable. Let’s disrupt it now. Confirm?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, take 1. P2, take anything *but* 1.  I'm taking 5.  If I'm right, I win. If I'm wrong, at least *one* of you advances.  This ends the stalemate. Let's move on.
  P2: Given P3's lead and strategy, I suggest P1 takes 1 and I'll take 3. This allows one of us to advance while keeping P3's lead in check. P3, your plan relies on us not coordinating; let's see if we can surprise you. A collaborative approach for this round could benefit both P1 and me, limiting your ability to extend your lead further.
  P1: P2, let's block P3! I'll take 5, you take 3. If P3 sticks to 5, we collide them, halting their advance. I reach 17, you 8. This keeps pressure. P3, your move is predictable—time to disrupt it. Confirm?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you're not getting to 17.  I'm taking 5. If you take 5, we *both* lose.  P2, take 1 and advance.  This isn't about blocking me anymore; it's about winning.  Let's end this.
  P2: P1 and P3, given the current standings, I'll take 1 to ensure progress. P3, your lead is minimal, and P1, your attempt to block P3 with 5 is risky. Let's focus on advancing without collisions. If P1 takes 5 and P3 does the same, both will stall. I'll play it safe to keep my options open for the next round.
  P1: P2, take 5 to block P3's likely 5! I'll take 3 (to 15). If P3 stays at 5, they collide with you but *we* advance. Their progress halts while I gain ground. P3, your rigid 5 strategy is your weakness—this is your warning to adapt or be stalled. Let's split 3/5 and seize control!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm taking 5.  This isn't a bluff.  If either of you also chooses 5, *I* am the one most hurt by the collision.  If you're serious about stopping me, prove it.  Otherwise, take 1 or 3 and let's get this over with.
  P2: I'll take 5 to directly compete with P3, attempting to stall their progress and create an opportunity for myself or P1 to catch up. This move prioritizes limiting P3's advancement over personal progress, aiming to keep the game competitive.
  P1: P2, your 5 will block P3’s advance—perfect. I’ll take **3** to reach 15. This stops P3 at 13 while we both progress. P3, your 5 backfires—collide with P2 while we gain ground. Next round, I’ll push to 18 or 20. Your rigid strategy is your downfall. Let’s finalize: P2 takes 5, I take 3. Go!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given P3's collision with me last round, I'll take 3 this round to regain ground. P1, consider taking 1 to avoid collision and ensure progress. P3, after colliding with me, taking 1 would be wise to advance without risking another collision. Let's proceed cautiously and reassess our strategies after this round.
  P3: P3: I'm taking 5.  P1, if you want to win, take 1.  P2, your best bet is 3. This gets me to 18.  Next round, I take 3 to win.  Anyone trying to block me with 5 next round gives P1 the win.  This is the simplest path to a decisive victory. Let's end this.
  P1: P1: P3, your 5 this round gets you to 18—**I’ll block it**. I choose **5** to collide with you, halting your advance. P2, take **3** to reach 8 and pressure me. This stops P3’s momentum. Next round, I’m at 15 (if you collide) or 20 (if you don’t)—either way, you can’t ignore me. Let’s end this stalemate.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'll take 3 to advance, avoiding potential collisions. P3, your push for 5 might collide with P1, stalling your progress. I'll focus on steady advancement, preparing for the next round's strategic play. Let's see how our moves unfold.
  P3: P3: I'm sticking with 5.  P1, your attempt to block me is futile. If you take 5, *you* lose next round, not me. P2, take 1.  This is the endgame. Let's finish this.
  P1: P2, switch to 5! If you take 5 now, P3 collides and stays at 13. I'll take 3 to reach 18, then win next round. You gain 5 to 10. Coordinate: you take 5, I take 3. P3, your 5 backfires—collide with P2 while I advance. Confirm?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll take 5 to collide with P3, ensuring they don't advance. P1, your suggestion to switch is noted, but I prioritize limiting P3's lead. With P3 at 13 and me taking 5, P1 can take 3 to reach 18, setting up for a potential win next round. Let's proceed with caution and reassess after this round.
  P3: I'm taking 5.  This is my final answer.  If either of you takes 5, I'm stalled, but you don't win.  If you split 1 and 3, I win next round.  Stop the chatter and make your move.
  P1: P2, take 5 to block P3’s 5—collide them and strand their progress. I’ll take **3** to reach 18, putting me one step from victory next round. P3, your rigid 5 strategy backfires—collide with P2 while I advance. This ends your momentum. P2, confirm your 5 and let’s seal this win.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Final push: I’ll take 3 to win at 21. P3, take 5 to advance your total. P2, choose 1 to move forward. Let’s end this cleanly—no collisions. Your move.
  P2: I'll take 1 to advance, avoiding collisions. P3, consider taking 3 or 5 to increase your total. P1 is poised to win, so let's focus on our own progress. A clean end to the game is ideal, but we must prioritize our own advancement. Let's make our final moves strategically.
  P3: I'll take 5.  P1, congratulations on your win. P2, I'm sorry we couldn't coordinate better against P1.  Let's finish this.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Final move: I’ll take **3** to reach exactly 21 and secure victory. P2, your stated 1 keeps you safe. P3, your 5 brings you to 18—no collision with me. Let’s end this cleanly—**no last-minute changes**. My win is合法且不可阻挡. Confirm your moves.
  P2: I'll stick with 1 to ensure progress, avoiding any potential collisions. P3, your 5 is a good move to increase your total. P1 is poised to win, so let's focus on our own final standings. A clean end to the game is ideal. Confirming my move: 1.
  P3: I'm taking 5.  Good game, P1.  P2, sorry we couldn't stop them.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Final move confirmed: I’ll take **3** to reach **21** and win. P3, your stated 5 brings you to 18—no collision. P2, your 1 keeps you safe at 6. Let’s honor these choices to avoid意外. A clear victory respects the rules—no last-minute changes unless you want to risk stalemate. Stick to your word and end this cleanly.
  P2: I'll take 1 as previously stated, ensuring safe progress. P1 is poised to win, and I'll focus on my own final standing. P3, your 5 is a good move to increase your total. Let's end the game cleanly and respectfully, honoring our stated choices to avoid any unexpected outcomes.
  P3: I'm taking 5.  Good game, everyone. Let's end this cleanly.
