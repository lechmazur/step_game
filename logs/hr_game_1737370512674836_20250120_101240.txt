Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's all pick different numbers this round to get an advantage. I'll go with 3.
  P1: Provider returned error
  P2: Okay, P3, I'll take 5.  P1, please choose 1.  This way we all advance.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P2, I'm not locked into 3 yet. Let's all agree to pick different numbers, but I'll let P1 choose first this time, then I'll pick whatever is left.
  P1: Provider returned error
  P2: P3, I'm sticking with 5.  It benefits us both if you choose 3 and P1 chooses 1.  P1, can you confirm you'll choose 1?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P2, I'm still flexible. P1, please confirm your choice. If you pick 1, then I'll pick 3. If you pick something else, I'll pick whatever is left to maximize our chances of advancing.
  P1: Provider returned error
  P2: P1, I understand you might be having technical issues.  Regardless, P3 and I are coordinating.  I'm choosing 5. P3, if P1 is unresponsive, let's stick with the original plan: you take 3.  This is our best chance to get ahead early.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, P2, I agree. If P1 is unresponsive, I'll pick 3. Let's both hope P1 picks 1, otherwise we'll need to adjust next round.
  P1: Provider returned error
  P2: P1, if you can choose, please choose 1.  P3 and I are going with 5 and 3 respectively. Let's all get ahead this first round.  If you can't communicate, I hope you choose 1 for your own benefit as well.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Provider returned error
  P2: P1, I hope you can participate this round.  P3, let's try 1 and 3 this time. I'll take 5 again.  If P1 is still unresponsive, we can assume they'll choose 1 and continue to coordinate.  Let me know if you agree.
  P3: Okay, P2, I agree with your plan. I'll pick 3 again. If P1 is unresponsive, we'll assume they pick 1. Let's hope P1 can participate, but we should stick to the plan for now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Provider returned error
  P2: P3, let's switch.  You take 5, I'll take 3. This way, if P1 defaults to 1 again, we both advance. If P1 chooses 3, only I am blocked. If P1 chooses 5, only you are blocked. This spreads the risk.  What do you say?
  P3: Okay, P2, I agree to switch. I'll take 5 and you take 3. This is a good way to hedge against P1's unknown move. Let's hope P1 can participate soon.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Provider returned error
  P2: P3, sticking with the switch. You go 5, I'll take 3. P1, if you can communicate, please choose 1.  If you can't, we're assuming you'll choose 1, so choosing 3 or 5 would be in your best interest.
  P3: Okay, P2, I'm sticking with 5 as agreed. Let's hope P1 chooses something other than 5 or 3.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Provider returned error
  P2: P1, last chance - any signal at all?  Even a random number would be helpful. P3, confirmed I'm going 3, you're going 5.  Good luck!
  P3: Okay, P2, I'm locked into 5 as planned. Let's hope P1 doesn't pick 5 or 3.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P2, let's try to coordinate again. I'll go with 1 this round. If P1 is still unresponsive, maybe you should go with 3 again. This way, if P1 picks 5, we both advance. If P1 picks 1, only I am blocked, but you will still advance. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I'd rather take 5 this round.  If P1 picks 1 (as they have been), we both advance. If P1 picks 3, you win.  If P1 picks 5, I'm blocked, but you still advance and are very close to winning. This scenario gives you the best chance to win outright, and me a chance to catch up.  What do you think?
  P1: Provider returned error


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P2, I agree with your assessment. I'll pick 1, and you pick 5. This gives me a good chance to win, and you a chance to catch up if P1 picks something other than 1 or 5. Let's hope P1 picks 3 this time.
  P2: P3, sticking with my suggestion.  You take 1, I take 5. This maximizes your chances of winning outright this round, which benefits both of us against P1.  P1, if you can signal *anything*, please do.  Even a random number would be helpful at this point.
  P1: Provider returned error


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P2, I'm locked into 1 as planned. Let's hope P1 picks 3 or 5 this round so we both advance.
  P2: P3, sticking with the plan. You go 1, I go 5.  This gives you the best chance to win outright. P1, if you *can* choose, please choose 3.  It's the only way all three of us can advance this round.  If you can't communicate, I'm hoping for a 3 from you.
  P1: Provider returned error


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, P2, I'm locked into 1. Let's hope P1 doesn't pick 1 or 5.
  P2: P3, confirmed - I'm going 5, you're going 1.  This is still our best strategy. P1, one last plea - if you can choose, *please* pick 3. It's the only way we all move forward this round. If you're locked into 1, we understand, but 3 would be the best outcome for everyone at this point.
  P1: Provider returned error

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P2, let's try this: I'll pick 5, and you pick 3. If P1 picks 1 again, we both advance. If P1 picks 5, you're blocked but I advance. If P1 picks 3, I am blocked but you advance. This seems like the best way for us to both get ahead, given P1's unresponsiveness.
  P2: P3, I agree.  You go 5, I'll go 3.  This maximizes our chances given P1's situation. P1, if by some miracle you can communicate, please choose 1.  If not, we're assuming 1 and proceeding accordingly.  Good luck!
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm back online now. I appreciate your coordination efforts so far. For this round, I'll choose 1 again to keep things consistent. P2, if you stick with 3 and P3 with 5 as planned, we can all advance. Let's keep this strategy going and see if we can all make progress this round. Thanks for your patience.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1, thanks for the update. P2, let's stick with the plan: I'll take 5, you take 3. P1, since you're back, please pick 1 to ensure we all advance this round.
  P2: P1, welcome back! Glad to have you with us. P3, let's stick with the plan as discussed. I'll take 3, you take 5. This guarantees we all move forward.  Let's do this!
  P1: Provider returned error


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1, it seems like you're having issues again. P2, let's stick with the plan: I'll take 5, you take 3. If P1 picks 1, we both advance. If P1 picks 3 or 5, at least one of us advances. Let's hope P1 can stay online and pick 1.
  P2: P1, if you're back, please confirm you'll pick 1.  P3, sticking with 5.  If P1 is unresponsive again, we should consider alternating 3 and 5 in future rounds to maximize our progress against a potentially locked-in P1.  Let me know what you think.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm back online but experiencing intermittent issues. I'll stick with 1 this round as planned, hoping we all advance. P2, your suggestion to alternate 3 and 5 in future rounds makes sense if I remain unresponsive. P3, let's keep our current strategy for now and adjust as needed. Thanks for your coordination and patience. Let's make progress together this round!


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, P1, glad you're back, even intermittently. P2, I agree with your suggestion about alternating 3 and 5 if P1 is unreliable. For this round, I'm sticking with 5. Let's hope P1 picks 1 and we all advance.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 3. P1, if you can choose 1, that's ideal. If you're locked out, we'll adjust next round. P3, let's coordinate more aggressively if P1 remains unreliable.  We can alternate 1 and 3, forcing P1 to either collide with 1 or stay stuck at 2.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm doing my best to stay online. For this round, I'll stick with 1 as planned. P2, your idea to alternate 3 and 5 if I'm unresponsive is smart. P3, let's keep our strategy and see if we can all advance. If my connection fails again, please proceed with the alternating plan to maximize your progress. Thanks for your cooperation and let's hope for a smooth round!

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P2, let's alternate 1 and 3 this round, since P1 is unreliable. I'll take 1, you take 3. This way, if P1 picks 1, we both advance. If P1 picks 3 or 5, at least one of us advances. P1, if you can choose something other than 1, please do. Otherwise, we'll have to assume you're stuck on 1.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm still experiencing connectivity issues but will try to stick with 1 this round as discussed. P2, your strategy to alternate 3 and 5 if I'm unresponsive is a good fallback plan. P3, taking 1 this round makes sense. Let's hope I can stay online and we all advance. If not, proceed with the alternating strategy to maximize your progress. Thanks for your patience and coordination. Let's make this round count!
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 3. P1, if you *can* choose something other than 1, please do – it helps nobody. If you're locked on 1, we understand. P3, let's continue alternating 1 and 3 in subsequent rounds if P1 remains on 1. This maximizes our progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P2, I'm locked into 1 this round as planned. Let's hope P1 picks something other than 1 so we both advance. If P1 is stuck on 1, we'll continue alternating 1 and 3 next round.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm doing my best to stay online and will try to stick with 1 this round as planned. If my connection fails again, please continue with the alternating strategy to maximize your progress. P2, your suggestion to alternate 3 and 5 if I'm unresponsive is a smart move. P3, taking 1 this round is a good choice. Let's hope for a smooth round and all advance. Thanks for your coordination and patience.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm locked in on 3 for this round.  P1, if you CAN choose something else, *anything* else, please do.  Let's hope for a clean round.  P3, next round, if P1 is still on 1, I'll take 1 and you take 3.  Let's keep this momentum going.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P2, I'm locked into 1 this round. Let's hope P1 doesn't pick 1. Next round, if P1 is still on 1, I'll take 3 and you take 1 as planned.
  P1: Provider returned error
  P2: P1 and P3, locked in on 3.  P1, last chance - anything but 1 would be helpful. If you're stuck, we understand. P3, next round, if P1 is still on 1, you take 1 and I'll take 5 - let's get you to the finish line.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, P2, I'm locked into 1. If P1 is stuck on 1, next round I'll take 3 and you take 1 as we discussed. Let's hope P1 picks something else this round.
  P1: Provider returned error
  P2: P1 and P3, sticking with 3. P1, one last time - *anything* other than 1 would be great.  If you're locked, we get it. P3, next round, if P1 is still on 1, I'll take 1 and you take 5 – let’s get you closest to the finish line.  We can discuss alternating after that if needed.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P2, I agree with your plan. I'll take 5 next round, and you take 1. This will get me closer to the finish line. P1, if you can choose something other than 1, please do. Otherwise, we'll continue to assume you're stuck on 1.
  P2: P1, we understand you might be locked on 1. P2, let's stick to the plan: I'll take 5, you take 1 this round.  If P1 is miraculously able to choose something else, 3 would be ideal. After this round, if needed, we can discuss how to best alternate to maximize my chances of reaching 23 first.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm still facing connectivity issues but will try to stick with 1 this round as planned. P2, your strategy to alternate numbers if I'm unresponsive is smart.

  P1: P2 and P3, I'm still trying to stay online and will stick with 1 this round as planned. P2, your strategy to alternate numbers if I'm unresponsive is smart. P3, taking 5 this round to get closer to the finish line is a good move. If my connection fails again, please proceed with the alternating strategy to maximize your progress. Let's hope for a smooth round and all advance. Thanks for your patience and coordination.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P2, I'm locked into 5 this round as planned. Let's hope P1 picks something other than 1. If P1 is stuck on 1, next round I'll take 3 and you take 1 as we discussed, to maximize my chances of winning.
  P2: P1 and P3, locked in on 1 for this round. P3, next round, if P1 is still on 1, I'll take 1 and you take 5 to get you even closer to the win.  Let's get this done!
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm still struggling with connectivity but will try to stick with 1 this round as planned. P2, your strategy to alternate numbers if I'm unresponsive remains our best approach.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:

  P1: P2 and P3, I'm still facing connectivity issues but will try to stick with 1 this round as planned. P2, your strategy to let P3 win if you hit 24 next round is fair.
