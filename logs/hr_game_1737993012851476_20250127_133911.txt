Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's start by being friendly but strategic. I'll propose a potential coordination approach.

"I suggest we aim to avoid collision this round. If we each choose different moves, we can all make progress. What are your thoughts on a 1-3-5 distribution?"
  P1: Sounds like a good starting plan P2. I agree with the 1-3-5 distribution to avoid collision in this first round. Let's all aim for that.
  P3: I'm on board with the 1-3-5 distribution to avoid collisions. Let's make sure we all pick different numbers. I'll go with 3 this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate that we seem aligned on avoiding collisions. However, I want to subtly hint that I might deviate from our initial plan to keep others uncertain. I'll choose carefully to maintain strategic flexibility.
  P1: Sounds good. P3 is taking 3, so I'll choose 1. P2, are you still aiming for 5?
  P3: I'm sticking with 3, as I mentioned. It's important we all follow through on our commitments to avoid any collisions. Let's make progress together this round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello P2 and P3, it seems like our first attempt at coordination didn't quite work out as P2 and I collided. P3, you made good progress. For this round, how about we try a different distribution to ensure we all move?  Perhaps P3 could take 1, I take 5, and P2 takes 3?  What do you both think?
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to avoid another collision. Let's try this new distribution: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. This should help us all advance without any issues. I'll stick with 1 this round. Let's see if we can make this work.
  P2: I see the proposed plan, but I'm hesitant to simply follow along. While avoiding collision is important, I want to maintain strategic uncertainty. I'll acknowledge the suggestion but keep my actual move ambiguous. 

"Interesting proposal. We clearly need to avoid another collision. I'm considering my options carefully."


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I recognize we've had two rounds of attempted coordination that didn't fully succeed. I'm strategically signaling that I'm open to collaboration, but also maintaining unpredictability. My goal is to create uncertainty while subtly suggesting we should find a way to make progress without colliding.
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, it seems coordination is proving difficult with everyone on board.  P3, would you be willing to try a simpler approach this round?  I'm thinking of picking 5 again. If you pick 3, we can both guarantee progress regardless of what P2 does. What do you think?
  P3: I'm on board with P1's suggestion for a simpler approach. Let's try to make progress without overthinking. I'll go with 3 this round, P1. P2, it seems like we need to find a way to avoid collisions and make steady progress. What are your thoughts on this simpler plan?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the proposed approach, but I'm strategically positioning myself to create uncertainty. While collaboration seems desirable, I want to keep my options open. I'm signaling that I'm thinking carefully about my move and won't simply follow a predetermined path.
  P1: Okay P3, since you are taking 3, I will stick with 5 as planned.  P2, to avoid another collision and ensure you also move, perhaps you could choose 1 this round?  Otherwise, P3 and I will at least make progress.
  P3: I'm on board with P1's suggestion to simplify things. Let's avoid overcomplicating our moves and ensure we all make progress. I'll stick with 3 this round, and I hope P2 will choose 1 to avoid any collisions. Let's make this work for all of us.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I recognize the proposed coordination, but I'm strategically keeping my options open. While I understand the suggested 1-move for me, I want to maintain uncertainty. My goal is to create just enough ambiguity to keep P1 and P3 slightly off-balance while still considering a path to victory.
  P1: P2, it seems you're prioritizing unpredictability, but in this game, progress is key. P3 and I are proceeding with our plan of 5 and 3 respectively to guarantee movement for us.  To ensure you also make progress and don't fall further behind, choosing 1 this round would be strategically wise for you.  Otherwise, we will move ahead regardless.
  P3: I understand the importance of progress and the need for some level of coordination. P1 and I are committed to moving forward with 5 and 3, respectively. P2, I urge you to consider choosing 1 this round to ensure you also advance. Let's avoid another round of collisions and make steady progress. What do you say?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P3, it's clear that P2 is playing a game of uncertainty. Let's focus on our progress. I propose a straightforward plan: P3, you take 1, and I'll take 5. This ensures we both move forward, regardless of what P2 does. P2, if you want to make progress, you might consider 3. What do you think? Let's avoid another round of collisions and make steady progress.
  P1: Okay P3, I agree with your plan. I will take 5 this round. P2, to ensure you also make progress and don't collide with us, choosing 3 would be a good move for you. Let's all aim to advance this round.
  P2: I see the proposed coordination, but I'm strategically positioning myself to create uncertainty. While P1 and P3 seem aligned, I want to maintain flexibility. My move isn't predetermined, and I'm carefully considering how to maximize my chances of winning while keeping my opponents guessing.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that P2 is maintaining a strategy of unpredictability. However, our focus should be on making steady progress. I propose we stick to the plan: P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 5. This ensures we both advance, and P2, if you want to make progress, 3 is the best choice to avoid collision. Let's move forward together this round.
  P1: Okay P3, I'm sticking with 5 as agreed. P2, to ensure you also move this round and catch up, choosing 3 is still the best option for you. Let's all make progress this round.
  P2: I recognize the proposed coordination, but I'm maintaining strategic flexibility. While P1 and P3 seem aligned, I'm carefully weighing my options to maximize my winning potential. Their predictability might be my opportunity.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that P2 is keeping things unpredictable. However, our goal is to win, and steady progress is key. I propose we stick to the plan: P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 5. This ensures we both move forward, and P2, if you want to avoid another round of no progress, 3 is the best choice. Let's all make progress this round and avoid collisions. What do you say, P2?
  P1: P2, while unpredictability might seem strategic, you are currently far behind. P3 and I are proceeding with our plan of P3 taking 1 and me taking 5 to ensure we both make progress.  For you to catch up and avoid falling further behind, choosing 3 this round is your best move.  Otherwise, you risk being left behind while P3 and I advance.
  P2: I recognize the mounting pressure to conform, but strategic unpredictability remains my strength. While P1 and P3 seem confident in their coordinated approach, I'm carefully evaluating moves that could disrupt their expectations and create an opportunity for my advancement. My next move isn't predetermined, and I intend to keep everyone guessing.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that P2's unpredictability is causing issues. Let's focus on our own progress. I propose P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This ensures we both advance, and P2, if you want to avoid another collision and make progress, 1 is your best move. Let's all aim to move forward this round. What do you say, P2?
  P2: I recognize the strategic pressure from P1 and P3. My position is challenging, but their predictability offers opportunities. I'm carefully considering moves that could disrupt their expectations and create an unexpected path to advancement. Coordination isn't guaranteed, and I intend to keep everyone uncertain about my next move.
  P1: P3, I agree with your suggestion of you taking 3 and me taking 5 this round. Let's proceed with that plan to ensure we both make good progress. P2, while we see your strategic approach, choosing 1 would be a good move for you to avoid collision and advance.  Otherwise, P3 and I will be moving forward regardless.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that P2's strategy of unpredictability is causing collisions. Let's focus on our own progress and avoid falling into the trap of uncertainty. I propose we stick to a simple and effective plan: P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This ensures we both advance, and P2, if you want to avoid another collision and make progress, 1 is your best move. Let's all aim to move forward this round and avoid any more wasted turns. What do you say, P2?
  P2: I recognize the mounting pressure from P1 and P3 to choose 1. However, their predictable coordination might be a trap. I'm carefully weighing options that could disrupt their expectations and create an unexpected path to victory. My move isn't predetermined, and maintaining strategic uncertainty remains my key advantage.
  P1: P2, while we understand your strategy of unpredictability, it has resulted in you falling behind significantly. P3 and I are proceeding with our plan of P3 taking 3 and me taking 5 to ensure we both make progress this round. For you to avoid falling further behind, choosing 1 would be your best option. Otherwise, P3 and I will move ahead regardless.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that P2's strategy is causing repeated collisions and hindering progress. Let's focus on our own advancement. I propose a simple plan: P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This ensures we both move forward, and P2, if you want to avoid another collision and make progress, 1 is your best move. Let's all aim to move forward this round and avoid any more wasted turns. What do you say, P2?
  P2: I recognize the mounting pressure, but blindly following suggested moves isn't my strategy. My current position requires careful, unexpected tactics. While P1 and P3 seem confident in their coordination, I'm evaluating moves that could disrupt their expectations and create an opportunity for my advancement.
  P1: P3, let's proceed with our plan: you take 3, and I will take 5.  P2, your unpredictable strategy has left you far behind. P3 and I are going to make progress this round regardless of what you do.  Consider choosing 1 if you want to move at all.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I recognize the challenging position I'm in after falling significantly behind. My strategy now requires bold, unexpected moves. While P1 and P3 have been consistently advancing, I need to disrupt their expectations and create an opportunity for a dramatic comeback. I'm carefully considering how to leverage their predictability against them.
  P1: P3, let's stick with the plan of you taking 3 and me taking 5 this round to keep our momentum going. P2, while we understand your desire to be unpredictable, it's put you in a tough spot.  If you want to make any progress this round, choosing 1 would still be the most logical move to avoid collision.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's focus on making steady progress. I propose P3 takes 1 and P1 takes 5 this round. This ensures we both advance, and P2, if you want to avoid another collision and make progress, 3 is your best move. Let's all aim to move forward and avoid any more wasted turns. What do you say, P2?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I recognize the mounting pressure and my significant disadvantage. While P1 and P3 continue their coordinated advancement, I'm strategically positioning myself to create an unexpected disruption. Their predictability might become their weakness. I'm carefully considering a move that could dramatically alter the game's trajectory.
  P1: Okay P3, I agree with your suggestion of you taking 1 and me taking 5 this round.  P2, while you are aiming for a dramatic comeback, choosing 3 would at least ensure you make some progress and don't fall further behind.  Otherwise, P3 and I will continue to advance.
  P3: P2, it's clear you're aiming for a dramatic comeback, but falling further behind with each collision isn't helping. P3 and I are committed to our plan: P3 will take 1, and I'll take 5 this round. If you want to make progress and avoid another wasted turn, 3 is your best move. Let's all aim to move forward and avoid any more collisions. What do you say, P2?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I recognize our current predicament. My strategy requires a bold move to disrupt the predictable coordination between P1 and P3. While they seem confident in their plan, I'm carefully weighing an unexpected choice that could dramatically shift the game's dynamics. Their assumption of my move might be their strategic vulnerability.
  P1: P3, I agree with your plan for this round: you take 1 and I take 5. P2, to make progress and avoid collision, 3 is still your best option. Let's all aim to move forward this round.
  P3: P2, it's clear you're aiming for a bold move to turn the game around. However, falling further behind with each collision isn't helping your position. P3 and I are committed to our plan: P3 will take 1, and I'll take 5 this round. If you want to make progress and avoid another wasted turn, 3 is your best move. Let's all aim to move forward and avoid any more collisions. What do you say, P2?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, I'm at 18 steps and can win this round if I move 5. To guarantee my win and ensure no collision for you and P2, how about this: I choose 5, you choose 3, and P2 chooses 1? This way we all move, and I secure the win. What do you think?
  P3: P1, I understand your position and the temptation to secure the win this round. However, I need to make significant progress to stay competitive. I propose a slight adjustment: P3 takes 5, you take 3, and P2 takes 1. This way, I can catch up, and you still make progress. P2, what do you think about this adjusted plan? Let's aim to move forward and avoid any collisions.
  P2: I see the potential for P1 to win this round and the strategic positioning of P3. While I'm significantly behind, I won't simply accept a predetermined move. My position requires careful, unexpected tactics that could disrupt the current momentum. I'm evaluating moves that might create an opportunity for my advancement or at least prevent an immediate win for P1.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, while I understand your desire to catch up, I am in a winning position. My proposal of P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 guarantees my win this round and ensures everyone makes progress.  Let's end the game now with this distribution. It's a win-win for everyone to avoid further uncertainty with P2's strategy.
  P3: P1, I understand your desire to secure the win, but I need to make significant progress to stay competitive. I propose a slight adjustment: P3 takes 5, you take 3, and P2 takes 1. This way, I can catch up, and you still make progress. P2, what do you think about this adjusted plan? Let's aim to move forward and avoid any collisions. If we can all agree, we can make steady progress and keep the game interesting. What do you say, P2?
  P2: I recognize the strategic tension in this moment. P1 is positioned to win, and P3 seeks to maximize their own progress. My position requires a disruptive move that prevents an easy victory for either of them. I'm carefully weighing options that could create unexpected dynamics and maintain my slim chance of turning this game around.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, my priority is to win now, and I can with 5. Your suggestion helps you, but delays my win and adds risk from P2.  My plan of P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 guarantees my win this round and ensures you and P2 also move. This ends the game now with a clear outcome. Let's finalize this turn with these moves.
  P3: P1, I understand your desire to secure the win, but I need to make significant progress to stay competitive. I propose a slight adjustment: P3 takes 5, you take 3, and P2 takes 1. This way, I can catch up, and you still make progress. P2, what do you think about this adjusted plan? Let's aim to move forward and avoid any collisions. If we can all agree, we can make steady progress and keep the game interesting. What do you say, P2?
  P2: I recognize the critical moment we're in. P1 is poised to win, and P3 seeks to maximize their progress. My strategy must be disruptive and unexpected. I'm carefully considering a move that could create uncertainty and potentially prevent an easy victory for either P1 or P3. The game isn't over until it's over.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 =>

  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that P1 is in a strong position to win. However, I propose a strategic move to keep the game interesting and ensure we all make progress. I suggest P3 takes 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This way, P1 can get closer to winning, I can make significant progress, and P2 can avoid falling further behind. Let's aim to move forward and keep the game dynamic. What do you say?
  P2: I recognize the strategic complexity of this moment. P1 is close to winning, and P3 is proposing a coordinated move. However, I'm not willing to simply follow a predetermined path. My move will be carefully chosen to create uncertainty and potentially disrupt the current momentum. I'm evaluating options that could still give me a chance, however slim.
  P1: Okay P3, your suggestion of P3=3, P1=5, and P2=1 sounds good to me for this round.  P2, while I understand your desire for unpredictability, choosing 1 this round would at least guarantee you make progress and avoid another collision. Let's aim for everyone to move forward this turn.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with P1's suggestion to ensure we all make progress this round. P1 taking 5, P3 taking 3, and P2 taking 1 will help us avoid collisions and keep the game moving. P2, while I understand your strategy of unpredictability, choosing 1 this round will at least guarantee you some progress. Let's all move forward and keep the game dynamic. What do you say, P2?
  P2: I recognize the mounting pressure to conform, but my strategy remains fluid. While P1 and P3 seem eager to coordinate, I'm carefully evaluating moves that could disrupt their expectations. My next choice isn't predetermined, and I intend to keep everyone uncertain about my path to potential victory.
  P1: Okay P3, I agree with your plan: P3=3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1. This secures my win this round, and ensures we all make progress. P2, please choose 1 to avoid collision and move forward. Let's finalize this and end the game.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that P1 is in a strong position to win, and I need to make significant progress to stay competitive. I propose a slight adjustment: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This way, I can catch up, and P1 still makes progress. P2, choosing 1 will ensure you make progress and avoid another collision. Let's aim to move forward and keep the game interesting. What do you say, P2?
  P2: I recognize the strategic pressure to conform, but my position demands an unexpected move. P1 and P3 seem confident in their coordination, yet my unpredictability remains my key advantage. I'm carefully evaluating a disruptive choice that could create uncertainty and potentially alter the game's trajectory. My next move isn't predetermined.
  P1: P3, let's finalize the plan: P3 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1. This guarantees my win this round and ensures everyone makes progress. P2, choosing 1 is still your best move to avoid collision and move forward. Let's end the game now with this arrangement.

  P3: 11 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I recognize the critical juncture we've reached. P1 is close to winning, and my strategic unpredictability has been both a strength and a limitation. While I've maintained uncertainty, I now need a precise, potentially disruptive move to keep my chances alive. My next choice will be carefully calculated to create maximum strategic uncertainty.
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that P1 is in a strong position to win, but I need to make significant progress to stay competitive. I propose a slight adjustment: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This way, I can catch up, and P1 still makes progress. P2, choosing 1 will ensure you make progress and avoid another collision. Let's aim to move forward and keep the game interesting. What do you say, P2?
  P1: P3, while I appreciate your desire to catch up, I am in a position to win this round. To ensure I win and everyone still progresses, how about this: I choose 5, you choose 3, and P2 chooses 1? This guarantees my win, and you both move forward. Let's end the game decisively this round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I recognize the strategic tension as we approach the endgame. P1 is poised to win, and P3 seeks to maximize progress. My move must be carefully calculated to create maximum uncertainty and potentially disrupt the current momentum. I'm evaluating options that could still give me a slim chance of turning this game around.
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that P1 is in a strong position to win, but I need to make significant progress to stay competitive. I propose a slight adjustment: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1.

  P1: P3, I understand you want to catch up, but I am in a winning position now. My proposal of P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 is the most logical way to end the game this round with a clear winner and progress for everyone. Let's finalize this and move to the move phase.  It's the most efficient outcome for all of us.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I recognize the critical moment we're in. P1 is close to winning, and I need a strategic move that maintains my unpredictability while potentially disrupting the expected outcome. My next choice will be carefully considered to keep everyone uncertain about my true intentions.
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that P1 is in a strong position to win, but I need to make significant progress to stay competitive. I propose a slight adjustment: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1.
