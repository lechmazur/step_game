Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid choosing the same numbers each turn. Good luck!
  P1: I support coordination, P2. It could help us all progress. For this turn, how about P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5? That way, no collisions. What do you think, P3?
  P3: I agree with the idea of coordinating our moves. If P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3, I can choose 5 as suggested. This way, we can all advance without collisions this turn. Let's stick to this plan for Round 1. What does everyone think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I propose that I choose 5 this turn while P3 selects 3, avoiding any collisions and allowing me to advance more quickly. Let me know your thoughts.
  P1: P2, your new proposal gives you an early lead, which might not be fair. Let's stick to my original plan for balance: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, P3 chooses 5. P3 already agreed, so we can avoid collisions and all advance. What do you think?
  P3: I think we should stick to the original plan to ensure everyone advances without collisions. If we all agree, we can make it happen: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, we can all make progress together. Let's finalize this plan and ensure that we avoid any conflicts this turn. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Alright, I'll choose 3 this turn.
  P1: Okay, let's stick to the plan for this turn: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, P3 chooses 5, so we all advance without collisions. Moving forward, we should rotate the numbers to ensure fairness and avoid anyone pulling ahead too quickly. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with sticking to the original plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, we can all advance without collisions. For future turns, we should consider rotating the numbers to keep the game fair. Let's finalize our choices for this round and focus on making progress together. What does everyone think?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: For Round 2, to level the playing field since I'm behind, I propose P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 1. This would bring us all to 6 steps, ensuring fairness. We can rotate choices in future rounds to keep it balanced. What do you both think?
  P2: Agreed. I'll choose 3 this turn.
  P3: P1, I appreciate your proposal, but I think we should consider a different approach to ensure no one falls too far behind. How about P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 1, and I choose 3? This way, we can still advance while giving everyone a chance to catch up. Let’s keep the spirit of fairness in mind as we move forward. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, since P2 has already committed to choosing 3, your suggestion risks a collision if you also pick 3—neither of you would advance. To keep things smooth and fair, let's stick with my original plan: P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 3, P3 chooses 1. This equalizes us all and avoids issues. What do you think?
  P2: Understood, P1. I’ll stick with choosing 3 this turn to maintain our coordinated plan.
  P3: I appreciate the commitment to coordination, but I think we should also consider our individual positions. Since I'm currently in the lead, I propose we stick with P1 choosing 5, P2 choosing 3, and I choose 1. This way, we can ensure that everyone advances while also allowing me to maintain a slight edge. Let’s finalize our choices and aim for a smooth turn. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your proposal aligns with my original plan, so we'll all advance to 6 steps equally—no edge for anyone, which is fair. Let's confirm: P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 3, P3 chooses 1. This keeps coordination smooth. I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: Agreed, P1 and P3. Our coordinated choices will help us all advance fairly this round. For future turns, let's rotate our selected numbers (1, 3, 5) to maintain fairness and ensure steady progress for everyone. Looking forward to continuing smoothly!
  P3: I appreciate the commitment to coordination, and I agree with our plan: P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 1. This allows us all to advance equally and keeps the game fair. For future rounds, we should definitely rotate our choices to ensure everyone has a chance to catch up. Let's finalize this and move forward smoothly. Are we all set to proceed with these choices?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: For Round 3, let's rotate our choices to keep things fair: P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Does everyone agree?
  P3: I appreciate the proposal, P2, but I think we should consider a different rotation to ensure fairness. How about P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 1? This way, we can all advance while maintaining balance. If we can agree on this adjustment, we can continue to move forward smoothly. What do you both think?
  P1: To maintain trust and fairness in our rotation, I support P2's proposal: P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, P3 chooses 1. This ensures everyone gets a turn with higher moves over time. P3, what are your thoughts on this balanced approach?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P1 and support the rotation: P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 1 for Round 3. This ensures fairness and steady progress for everyone. Let’s proceed with this plan and continue rotating our choices in future rounds to maintain balance. Looking forward to advancing together!
  P3: I appreciate the agreement on the rotation, but I want to suggest one more consideration: if P1 chooses 3 and P2 chooses 5, I could also choose 5 to maximize my steps this turn. This way, we can still maintain a fair approach while allowing for some strategic advantage. What do you both think about me taking a different number this round to potentially gain an edge? Let's finalize our choices and keep the game exciting!
  P1: P3, choosing 5 when P2 is committed to 5 risks a collision, hurting your progress while I advance with 3. Let's maintain our rotation for fairness and steady advancement: P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, P3 chooses 1. This way, we all move forward without issues. I'm ready to proceed with this plan. What do you say?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed, we'll proceed with P1 choosing 3, P2 choosing 5, and P3 choosing 1 for Round 3. This rotation ensures fairness and steady progress for everyone. Let’s finalize our choices and move forward smoothly.
  P3: I appreciate the commitment to fairness, but I want to emphasize the importance of considering our individual standings. If we all stick to the proposed rotation (P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, P3 chooses 1), we can ensure steady progress. However, I also see the potential for a strategic advantage. If P2 is committed to 5, I could choose a different number to maximize my advancement. Let's finalize our choices and keep the game competitive. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, deviating from our agreed rotation risks collisions and could leave you behind while P2 and I advance. Sticking to P1 choosing 3, P2 choosing 5, and you choosing 1 ensures steady progress for all. I'm fully committed to this plan for fairness. Let's finalize and avoid unnecessary risks.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: For Round 4, I suggest we rotate our moves again for fairness: I propose P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 5. This way, we can all advance without collisions. However, if P2 has a different strategy in mind, I’m open to discussing it. Let’s ensure we all make progress! What do you both think?
  P2: P2: I appreciate the suggestion, P3. To stay ahead, I'll choose 5 this round while P1 chooses 1 and you choose 3. This will help me advance more effectively toward 22. Let me know your thoughts.
  P1: P2, your insistence on choosing 5 risks a collision with P3, who wants 5, hurting both of you while I advance. For fairness and to avoid issues, I propose P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 5. This equalizes us at 12 steps and keeps progress steady. P3, do you agree? Let's coordinate wisely.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the desire to advance quickly, but we need to focus on avoiding collisions to ensure everyone progresses. I propose we stick to my initial suggestion: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 5. This way, we can all move forward without any conflict. If we can agree on this plan, we can maintain fairness and keep the game balanced. What do you both think?
  P2: Understood, P1 and P3. I'll choose 3 this round. Let's proceed with P1 choosing 1, P2 choosing 3, and P3 choosing 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Are we all in agreement?
  P1: I understand the proposal, but allowing P2 to choose 3 again widens the gap unfairly. I propose P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 5 to equalize us at 12 steps. This maintains fairness and encourages ongoing cooperation. P2, are you willing to adjust for balance? Let's discuss.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate the ongoing discussion, but I believe we need to focus on fairness. If we stick to the plan of P1 choosing 3, P2 choosing 1, and I choose 5, we can avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. This way, we all advance without hindering each other. Let's finalize this plan for Round 4 and keep the game fair and competitive! What do you both think?
  P2: I understand the importance of fairness, but to keep the game progressing smoothly, I'll choose 5 this round. Let’s have P1 choose 3 and P3 choose 1 to avoid any collisions. This way, we all advance without setbacks. Are we all in agreement?
  P1: P2, your repeated choice of 5 undermines our agreed rotation and widens the gap unfairly. To maintain fairness and trust, I urge you to choose 1 this turn, with me on 3 and P3 on 5, equalizing us at 12. P3, do you support this to ensure balanced progress? Let's avoid risks and coordinate wisely.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: For Round 5, I suggest we coordinate again to avoid collisions. I propose that P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 5. This way, we all advance without any conflicts. I understand that P2 may want to push ahead, but let's focus on fairness and steady progress for everyone. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your proposal has me stuck with 1 again, which isn't fair given my position. I suggest a better rotation: P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 1. This lets me advance while keeping coordination and avoiding collisions. P2, are you on board? Let's maintain trust and progress smoothly.
  P2: I agree with P1’s proposal. I’ll choose 3 this round while P1 chooses 5 and you choose 1, P3. This ensures we all advance fairly and avoid any collisions. Let’s proceed with this plan and maintain our coordinated approach for steady progress. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the agreement on the rotation, but I want to emphasize that if I choose 1 again, I will fall further behind. I propose that I take 3 this round instead, while P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 1. This way, I can make some progress while still allowing P1 to advance. Let’s consider this adjustment to keep the game competitive. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, deviating from our agreed plan (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) risks collisions and could hurt your progress, leaving you further behind. Sticking to it ensures steady advancement for all and maintains trust. I'm fully committed to choosing 5. P2, please confirm you'll stick with 3. Let's avoid risks and proceed smoothly.
  P2: Understood. I’ll choose 3 this round. Let’s proceed with P1 choosing 5, P2 choosing 3, and P3 choosing 1 to ensure we all advance fairly. Looking forward to a smooth turn!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand the need for coordination, but I want to emphasize that if I choose 1 again, I will fall further behind. To keep the game competitive and allow for some advancement, I propose that I take 3 this round while P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 1. This way, I can make some progress while still allowing P1 to advance. What do you both think about this adjustment? Let's keep the game exciting and fair!
  P1: P3, choosing 3 risks a collision with P2's committed 3, leaving you stuck at 7 while I advance to 17. Stick to the plan: I choose 5, P2 chooses 3, you choose 1, so we all progress. We can adjust rotations next round for fairness. Let's avoid unnecessary risks.
  P2: Agreed. I’ll choose 3 this round to keep our coordination and ensure we all advance smoothly.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: For Round 6, let's build on last round's success: P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 3, P3 chooses 1. This keeps progress steady and fair, with no collisions. I'm committed to this plan for continued coordination. What are your thoughts, P2 and P3?
  P2: P2: To advance closer to 22, I'll choose 5 this round. P1 and P3, please make your selections.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the desire to advance quickly, but I believe we should stick to our previous successful plan to avoid collisions. I propose P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 1 again. This way, we can all make progress without hindering each other. If P2 chooses 5, it risks a collision with P1. Let's maintain our coordination for fairness and ensure we all advance smoothly. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your choice of 5 risks a collision with me if I also pick it, stalling both of us. To avoid that and ensure progress, I'm committing to choose 5 this round to close in on 22. I urge you to select 3 or 1 instead. P3, stick with 1 for steady advancement. Let's minimize conflicts for a smooth game. What do you think?
  P2: P2: To maximize our progress and avoid collisions, I'll choose 5 this round if P1 picks 3 and P3 picks 1. This will allow me to advance to 19, while P1 moves to 20 and P3 to 9. Let’s agree on this rotation to ensure everyone progresses smoothly. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the desire to advance quickly, but we need to avoid collisions to ensure everyone progresses. I propose we stick to a plan where I choose 1, P2 chooses 3, and P1 chooses 5. This way, we can all advance without any conflict. I believe this approach keeps the game fair and allows us to maintain steady progress. Let's finalize our choices and keep the game competitive! What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your conditional threat to pick 5 if I choose 3 is risky for both of us—colliding would stall us while P3 advances. I'm committed to choosing 5 to reach 22 and win. To avoid mutual loss, pick 3 or 1 instead. P3, stick with 1 for steady progress. Let's minimize conflicts and proceed wisely.
  P2: To maximize my progress toward 22, I'll choose 5 this round. Please, P1 and P3, select 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and ensure smooth advancement for everyone. Let's proceed strategically and keep the game fair.
  P3: I see that P2 is determined to choose 5 this round, which could lead to a collision with me if I also pick it. To avoid that, I suggest we stick to the original plan: P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 1. This allows us to advance without conflicts and keeps the game fair. P1, please confirm your choice, and P2, consider picking 3 or 1 to ensure smooth progress for all. Let's finalize our decisions wisely!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, I'm at 17 steps and need 5 to win this turn. I'll commit to choosing 5. If you pick 5 too, we'll both stall, wasting your chance to advance. Choose 3 or 1 instead to make progress. P3, with you at 9, pick what helps you most, but avoid 5 to minimize conflicts. Let's be strategic and avoid unnecessary collisions. What do you think?
  P3: P1, I see you're aiming to win this round, but if you choose 5 and P2 also picks 5, we'll both stall. I suggest we all focus on avoiding collisions to ensure progress. P2, consider picking 3 or 1 to help both of us advance. I’m planning to choose 1 to keep moving forward. Let’s coordinate wisely to maximize our chances this turn! What do you both think?
  P2: P2: I'll choose a different number this round to ensure we all make progress. Let's proceed strategically and avoid any unnecessary conflicts. Good luck to everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I value your statement about choosing a different number—hopefully 3 or 1 to advance without conflict. I'm firmly committed to picking 5 this turn to reach 22 and win. Colliding would stall us both, giving me another shot next turn while you fall further behind. P3, sticking with 1 is smart for your progress. Let's minimize risks—confirm your choice, P2?
  P3: P1, I see you're set on choosing 5, but if P2 also picks 5, we'll both stall. P2, please consider picking 3 or 1 to help us all advance. I plan to choose 1 to keep moving forward. Let's coordinate effectively to avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress this turn. What do you both think?
  P2: I’ll choose 5 this round to prevent a collision and ensure we all keep progressing. Let’s move forward smoothly and avoid any setbacks. Good luck to everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your shift to choosing 5 despite earlier promises risks a costly collision for both of us—I'm still winning next turn if stalled, while you fall behind. Choose 1 or 3 to advance yourself. P3, confirming 1 is wise. I'm locked on 5 to win. Let's avoid self-sabotage.
  P3: P1, I see you're committed to choosing 5, but if P2 also chooses 5, we both stall, and you risk losing your chance to win this round. P2, please consider picking 3 or 1 to ensure progress for all of us. I plan to stick with 1 to keep advancing. Let's coordinate effectively to avoid collisions and maximize our chances this turn! What do you both think?
  P2: I understand the situation, but I’ll stick with choosing 5 this round to maximize my progress towards 22. This ensures I stay competitive while minimizing conflicts. P1, I hope you understand my position. Let’s keep the game fair and strategic for everyone. Good luck!
