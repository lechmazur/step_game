Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's discuss our strategies for this first round. Since we're all at 0 steps, we have a chance to either cooperate or compete right from the start. If we coordinate our moves, we might avoid collisions and make progress. What does everyone think? Should we aim for a specific move, or do you prefer to keep it random?
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I think it’s important to establish some level of coordination to avoid collisions. How about we all agree to choose different moves this round? For example, if I choose 1, maybe one of you can choose 3 and the other 5. That way, we all make progress. What do you think? If we can avoid overlapping, we can set ourselves up for a stronger start.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate the idea of coordinating our moves. To avoid collisions, let's agree on a plan. I suggest I take move 1 this round. P2, you could take move 3, and P3, you could take move 5.
