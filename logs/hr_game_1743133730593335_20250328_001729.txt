Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hello P1 and P3, let's try to coordinate this round to ensure we all move forward. How about P1 chooses move 1, I choose move 3, and P3 chooses move 5? This way we all advance. What do you think?
  P1: That sounds fair, P2. I’m okay with that plan: I’ll take move 1, you take 3, and P3 takes 5. Everyone moves forward safely. What do you say, P3?
  P3: Sounds good to me. I'll take move 5 as agreed. Let's stick to this plan and all move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, great, P1 and P3, it sounds like we have a plan for this round. Let's all choose our agreed moves: P1 move 1, P2 move 3, P3 move 5.  If everyone is ready, let's move to the move phase.
  P1: Glad we’re all on the same page. Let’s build trust early—if we all stick to the plan and move forward this turn, we can keep coordinating in future rounds for mutual benefit. Looking forward to seeing everyone follow through.
  P3: I agree, trust is key here. Let's follow through as planned, and we can continue coordinating smoothly in future rounds.

  P2 => 3    P2 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, looks like we both picked 5 last round and blocked each other—while P2 advanced. We can’t let that happen again. How about this: I’ll take 3, you take 1, and P2 takes 5 this round? That way we all move forward and avoid collisions. What do you both say?
  P2: Okay P1, your plan sounds reasonable to me. I'm happy to choose move 5 this round as you suggested, and let P1 take 3 and P3 take 1. Let's all aim to move forward this turn.
  P3: Alright, I agree with this plan—I'll take move 1 this round. Let's stick to it this time to avoid another collision.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks for agreeing, both of you. If we all stick to the plan—me on 3, P2 on 5, and P3 on 1—we’ll all make progress and rebuild trust. Let’s prove we can coordinate and keep the game fair for now. Ready to move?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, sounds like we have a solid plan for this round with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 1.  Let's all lock in these moves and ensure we each advance this turn. Ready when you are to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I'm ready to move forward with our agreed plan. Let's all follow through this round and avoid another setback.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let’s all follow through this time—if we each keep to the agreed moves (me 3, P2 5, P3 1), we all gain and no one gets blocked. Breaking trust now only sets us all back. Ready to see us all advance.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, it sounds like we are all set on the plan for this round: P1 move 3, P2 move 5, and P3 move 1.  Let's execute these moves and all advance. Ready when you are to proceed.
  P3: Ready to proceed. Let's all stick to the agreed moves and get back on track.

  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, it seems our previous plans didn't work out as expected. Let's try again to coordinate this round. How about this time: P1 chooses move 1, I choose move 5, and P3 chooses move 3? This way we should all be able to advance without collision. What are your thoughts?
  P1: P2, you’re clearly in the lead and trying to stay ahead while P3 and I are stuck. P3, we need to watch out—if we keep letting P2 move unchallenged, they’ll win fast. How about we coordinate this round: I take 3, you take 5, and we block P2 by both avoiding 5? Let’s level the field.
  P3: P1, I agree we can't let P2 run away with the lead. Your suggestion makes sense—I'll take 5, you take 3, and we avoid giving P2 another easy advance. P2, you've had your lead; it's time to balance things out.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand you want to balance the field. To ensure we all make progress, I will choose move 1 this round. How does that sound?
  P1: P3, if we stick to our plan—me on 3, you on 5—we both move forward and keep P2 in check. P2 says they’ll take 1, so if that’s true, no collisions. But if they lie again, we’ll know. Let’s test their word and help each other catch up.
  P3: P1, agreed. Let's stick to our plan—you take 3, I'll take 5. P2, if you're sincere about choosing 1, we'll see it clearly this round. Trust is earned through actions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, to show I'm serious about us all progressing, I will indeed choose move 1 as I said.  This round, let's all make sure we move forward.  I'm locking in move 1 now. Let's see if we can all advance.
  P1: P3, let’s stick to our plan—me on 3, you on 5. If P2 truly picks 1, we all move forward. But if they lie again, we’ll know they can’t be trusted. Let’s catch up together and keep the game competitive. Ready?
  P3: P1, I'm ready to stick to our agreement. Let's both move forward this round and see if P2 keeps their word. Actions speak louder than words—let's proceed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, we did well last round—both advanced and kept P2 in check. Let’s keep the momentum: I’ll take 5, you take 3 this time. If P2 tries to sneak ahead again, we block them. P2, if you want to cooperate now, take 1. Let’s see if you’re serious about fair play.
  P2: Okay P1, your plan sounds reasonable for this round.  P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I will choose move 1. P3, does that work for you? Let's all ensure we move forward this turn.
  P3: P1, your suggestion sounds good to me. I'll take 3 this round, you take 5, and let's see if P2 is genuinely cooperating by picking 1. Trust is still fragile, but we can keep this balance going if everyone sticks to their word.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, P3. We’re aligned again—me on 5, you on 3. If P2 truly takes 1, we all move forward and maintain balance. But if P2 breaks the deal, we’ll know they’re not serious about cooperation. Let’s keep the pressure on and not let anyone run away with the lead.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I confirm move 1 as agreed. Let's lock in these moves: P1 move 5, P3 move 3, and me move 1.  Looking forward to all of us advancing this round.
  P3: P1, agreed. Let's stick firmly to our plan—I'll choose 3, you choose 5. P2, you've stated you'll pick 1; let's see if your actions match your words again. Trust is built slowly. I'm ready to proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, we’re aligned—let’s stick to our plan: you on 3, me on 5. If P2 actually takes 1 again, we all move forward and keep things fair. But if P2 breaks their word, we’ll know they’re just trying to manipulate the game. Let’s keep the pressure on and stay united. Ready to move?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I confirm again, move 1 for me this round as we discussed. Let's all lock in our agreed moves and proceed to the move phase. Looking forward to a smooth round for everyone.
  P3: P1, I'm ready to stick with our agreed moves. P2, the ball is in your court—your actions this round will clearly show your intentions. Let's proceed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, last round worked well with everyone advancing.  To keep things balanced and fair, how about this round: P1 take move 5, P3 take move 3, and I will take move 1 again? This continues our progress without anyone getting too far ahead. What do you think?
  P1: P3, we’re tied and just behind P2. Let’s keep working together to catch up. I propose this: I take 3, you take 5, and P2 sticks to 1 if they’re truly committed to fairness. This way, you and I gain more ground while P2 plays safe. What do you say?
  P3: P1, your suggestion makes sense. I'll take move 5, you take 3, and let's see if P2 remains committed to fairness with move 1. Trust has improved, but let's stay cautious.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, to keep us all moving forward this round, let's repeat last round's successful plan: P1 move 5, P3 move 3, and P2 move 1. This ensures no collisions and steady progress for everyone. What do you think?
  P1: P3, we’re still in sync—if I take 3 and you take 5, we both gain solid ground and keep P2 from pulling ahead. P2 keeps pushing for the same plan that favors them most. If they’re truly playing fair, they’ll take 1 again. Let’s keep our momentum and test their consistency.
  P3: P1, agreed—we'll stick with our plan: you take 3, I take 5. P2, if you're sincere about fairness, you'll choose move 1 again. Let's move forward together without collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I understand you want to catch up.  Move 1 is fine with me again this round to ensure we all progress. Let's keep it as P1 move 3, P3 move 5, and P2 move 1 as discussed.  Ready to proceed.
  P1: P3, we’re aligned—me on 3, you on 5. We gain the most that way and keep pace with P2. P2, you’ve said you’ll take 1 again—this is your chance to prove consistency. If everyone sticks to the plan, we all move forward. Let’s lock it in. Ready?
  P3: P1, agreed—our plan is set. P2, your actions this round will clearly demonstrate your intentions. I'm ready to proceed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we've built some trust now, and the game is very close. To keep things fair and avoid collisions, let's rotate moves again. How about this round: P1 takes move 5, P2 takes move 3, and I'll take move 1. This ensures we all advance safely and keeps the game balanced. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, I see your proposal, but you’re now in the lead—so this plan benefits you most. To keep things balanced, I suggest: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1. That way, P2 and I catch up a bit while you still advance. Fairer for all. Thoughts?
  P2: Okay P1, your suggestion of P1 take 5, P2 take 3, and P3 take 1 sounds reasonable to me. It seems like a fair way to balance things out this round. Let's do that.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Alright, I understand your point, P1 and P2. I'm willing to take move 1 this round as suggested, trusting you'll both stick to your moves. Let's lock this in and advance together.
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3. We’re all aligned now—me on 5, P2 on 3, P3 on 1. Let’s follow through and keep the game tight and fair. If we all stick to it, we each gain and no one gets blocked. Ready to move forward?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, we're all set on P1 move 5, P2 move 3, and P3 move 1. Let's lock in these moves and proceed to the move phase. I'm ready when you are.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, we've built trust over the last few rounds by sticking to our agreements. Let's maintain that trust—I'm committed to our plan this round. Ready to proceed.
  P1: Great—we’re all aligned on moves this round: me on 5, P2 on 3, P3 on 1. If everyone follows through, we each advance and stay close. Let’s keep building trust and avoid collisions. Ready to lock it in and move forward?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, we are all in agreement for this round. Let's proceed with the plan: P1 move 5, P2 move 3, and P3 move 1. Ready to make our moves.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you're now in the lead—if we let you keep advancing unchallenged, you could win soon. P2, let’s work together this round to keep things balanced. I propose: I take 1, you take 5, and P3 takes 3. That way, P3 gains the least, and you and I move forward. What do you think?
  P3: P1, I understand your concern, but I've consistently shown willingness to cooperate fairly. Last round, I took move 1 as agreed, trusting both of you. I'm open to a balanced approach again—let's choose moves so everyone advances safely without collisions. P2, what do you think?
  P2: Okay P1, your plan sounds good to me.  P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3 seems like a fair way to balance things this round. P3, what do you think?  Let's aim for a round where we all move forward if possible.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you’ve built trust, but you’re now 6 steps from winning. If we let you keep advancing, you’ll cross 20 soon. P2 and I are tied—this round is key. If you truly want balance, take 1 again. I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5. That way, P2 gains most, I gain some, and you hold steady. Fair compromise?
  P3: P1, your new proposal heavily favors you and P2, leaving me stuck. I've shown good faith consistently. To maintain fairness, let's adjust slightly: I'll take move 1 again, P1 takes move 5, and P2 takes move 3. That way, you both advance ahead of me this round, keeping the game balanced. Does this sound fair to both of you?
  P2: P3, I think P1's suggestion of P1 taking 1, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 3 is a good compromise. You are currently ahead, so it makes sense for P1 and me to gain a bit more ground this round to keep the game balanced. This way we all still advance. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you’re still ahead and we need to keep things competitive. If you truly want fairness, take 1 this round and let P2 and me catch up a bit. I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5—everyone gains, and the game stays balanced. If you refuse, it shows you're prioritizing your lead over fairness. Let’s see.
  P3: P1, P2—I've already offered to take move 1 this round, letting you both advance more. I'm committed to fairness and willing to slow down to maintain balance. Let's avoid collisions and keep trust intact. Ready to proceed.
  P2: Okay P3, let's go with P1's plan: P1 takes 1, you take 3, and I take 5.  This way we all progress, and it seems like a reasonable compromise to keep the game balanced as P1 suggested.  Let's lock this in and move to the move phase.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1, P3 is getting close to winning. To make sure neither of us lets P3 run away with it, how about we coordinate to catch up this round? I'll choose move 5, and P1, could you take move 3? This way we both gain good ground. What do you think?
  P1: P2, I’m open to working with you this round—if you take 5 and I take 3, we both gain and keep pressure on P3. But we must ensure P3 doesn’t sneak ahead. P3, if you’re serious about fairness, take 1 again this round. That keeps things balanced and shows you're still playing cooperatively.
  P3: P1, P2—I took move 1 last round as agreed, yet you both collided on 5. Clearly, trust is shaky between you two. I'm still committed to fairness. How about this: I'll choose move 1 again this round to give you both another chance to advance and keep things balanced. Coordinate carefully this time to avoid another collision. Deal?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, P3 taking move 1 again sounds good to me.  P1, are you still taking move 3 as we discussed? If so, I will take move 5. This way we all move forward and keep the pressure on P3. Let's confirm these moves quickly and proceed.
  P1: P2, yes—I’m locked in for move 3 as we discussed. If you take 5 and P3 sticks to 1 again, we all move forward and keep the game tight. P3, if you truly want to prove fairness, this is your chance to show consistency. Let’s all follow through—no surprises. Ready to proceed?
  P3: P1, P2—I'm committed to fairness and sticking firmly to move 1 as promised. Coordinate carefully this round to avoid another collision. Let's proceed smoothly and keep the game balanced.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, let's lock in these moves for this round: P1 move 3, P2 move 5, and P3 move 1.  Let's all follow through and ensure we each advance and keep the game competitive. Ready to move when you are.
  P1: Great—we’re all aligned: I take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. If everyone holds to this, we all advance and keep the game close. P3, thanks for sticking with 1 again—your consistency helps build trust. P2, let’s not collide this time—timing is everything now. Ready to move?
  P3: P1, P2—I'm locked in firmly on move 1 as promised. Let's all follow through clearly this round and avoid collisions. Ready to proceed.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, we’re both behind—if P3 advances again, they could win next round. Let’s block P3 this turn. I propose: I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1 (if they’re still playing fair). If P3 picks 5 again, we block them. Let’s test their intentions and give ourselves a shot. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, I took a risk last round because trust between you and P2 seemed shaky. Clearly, we're all wary now. I'm still open to fairness—I'll take move 1 this round to demonstrate my commitment again. You and P2 can coordinate safely to advance. Let's avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Deal?
  P2: P1, your plan to block P3 makes sense given they are closest to winning.  If you take 5 and I take 3, we can see if P3 truly takes 1 as they say.  Let's do it.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, we’re aligned—me on 5, you on 3. If P3 really takes 1, we both advance and block their win path. P3, this is your moment to prove your commitment to fairness. If you pick 5 again, it’s clear you’re prioritizing victory over trust. Let’s see where everyone stands. Ready to move?
  P3: P1, P2—I see your point clearly. I'm committed to fairness and will choose move 1 this round as promised. Coordinate carefully to avoid collision. Let's keep the game competitive and rebuild trust. Ready to proceed.
  P2: P1 and P3, it sounds like we have a plan for this round: P1 move 5, P2 move 3, and P3 move 1. Let's all lock in these moves to ensure a non-collision round and see where we stand. Ready to proceed when you are both confirmed.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let’s lock it in—me on 5, P2 on 3, P3 on 1. If everyone sticks to this, P2 and I both gain and P3 shows good faith by holding back. Any deviation now will speak volumes. Ready to move?
  P3: P1, P2—I'm locked in on move 1 as promised. Let's proceed carefully and rebuild trust. Ready to move.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, we are all in agreement then: P1 move 5, P2 move 3, and P3 move 1. Let's proceed with these moves and see how the round plays out. Ready to lock in our choices and move forward.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps

  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, P1 is very close to winning! We need to make sure P1 doesn't win this round. How about this: to be safe, let's both P3 and I choose move 3 this round to block P1 if they also choose 3 to try to win. What do you think P3? We need to act fast to prevent P1 from reaching 20.
  P1: P2, P3—let’s not panic. If we all move forward without collisions, the game stays competitive. I propose: I take 1 this round, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. That way, I don’t win yet, and we all advance. It shows I’m not rushing for the win and keeps trust alive. Fair?
  P3: P2, your suggestion makes sense. P1 is clearly trying to win this round. Let's coordinate carefully to block them. I'm open to your plan of both choosing move 3 to ensure P1 doesn't slip through. P1, if you're sincere about fairness, you'll choose move 1 as you've stated. Let's proceed cautiously.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, yes, I agree with you. Let's both choose move 3 to block P1 this round as we discussed. P1, while your offer is noted, preventing you from winning immediately is the priority for both P3 and me right now. Let's coordinate on move 3 to ensure we both stay in the game.  Are you ready to do move 3, P3?
  P1: P2, P3—if I were trying to win outright, I’d have picked 1 last round and then 5 now. But I’m offering 1 this round to prove I’m not rushing. If you both pick 3, you block each other and gain nothing, while I stay still. That helps no one. Let’s all move forward: me on 1, P2 on 5, P3 on 3. It’s fair, keeps the game tight, and shows I’m not forcing a win. Your move.
  P3: P2, your idea makes sense—let's both choose move 3 to guarantee P1 can't sneak through and win this round. P1, if you're truly sincere about fairness, you'll pick move 1 as you've promised. Let's lock this in clearly and prevent any surprises. Ready to proceed.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, yes, let's definitely both do move 3 to block P1 from winning this round.  P1, while your offer is noted, our priority is to stop you from reaching 20 steps now. We will both choose move 3.
  P1: P2, P3—if you both take 3, you block each other and gain nothing. I’m sticking to move 1 this round to prove I’m not forcing a win. If you trust that, you can each advance: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. We all move, no one wins yet, and the game stays alive. You lose nothing by testing my sincerity. Let’s not self-sabotage.
  P3: P2, we've made our point clearly—let's not accidentally block each other. I'll stick firmly with move 3 as agreed; please do the same. P1, you've said you'll choose move 1—if you're sincere, we'll see it clearly this round. Ready to proceed.


Round 10, Move phase:
