Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let's try to avoid clashing in the first round. Maybe we can coordinate to choose different moves so we all advance a bit. What do you think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I agree with P2's idea to avoid clashing this round. Let's each pick a different number to ensure we all make progress. I’m open to any arrangement—maybe P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5? Let me know if this works for you or if you have another suggestion.
  P3: I agree we should avoid clashes. I’m leaning towards the higher move for an edge, though I’d like to keep some flexibility based on your commitments. If we can agree on distinct numbers this round, we might all make progress without interference. What do you both think?

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm keeping a high move approach to maintain my lead. If either of you plans to switch strategies to avoid collisions this turn, speak now. Otherwise, I'll stick with my momentum.
  P2: P3, I get your strategy, but if we both go high, we might clash and miss out. P1, you’re in a good spot to take a lower move and avoid any collisions. How about I go <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 sticks with <move>5</move>? This way, we maintain momentum without stepping on each other's toes. Let me know if this works for everyone.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m fine with sticking to a lower move to avoid clashes again this round. P2, your suggestion of me taking 1, you taking 3, and P3 taking 5 sounds good to me. P3, since you’re in the lead, are you okay with continuing this pattern for now? I think it benefits us all to keep progressing without collisions. Let me know if you’re on board or if there’s another split you’d prefer.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 =>

  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it looks like our strategy to avoid clashes is working well so far. However, P3, you're gaining a significant lead. To keep things balanced and ensure we all have a fair shot, how about we switch it up a bit this round? Maybe P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? This way, we keep advancing but mix up the order to prevent any predictable patterns. Let me know your thoughts.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate the suggestion to mix things up, P2. I’m okay with taking 3 this round to keep us all advancing and avoid clashes. P3, since you’re ahead, are you fine with taking 1 to balance things out a bit? I think this switch could help us maintain fairness while still progressing. Let me know if this works for you both or if there’s another arrangement you’d prefer.
  P3: I appreciate the suggestion, but I’m inclined to keep my pace strong. I believe that maintaining our momentum—especially when ahead—is crucial. I’m not comfortable switching to a lower step this round. If we can all coordinate without overlapping on the highest tempo move, I’m all for a fair round. Let’s avoid any collisions and keep pushing forward.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems like the last round didn’t go as planned with P3 and I clashing. P3, I understand your strategy to maintain a lead, but we risk losing progress if we collide again. How about this: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>? This way, we all advance without stepping on each other’s toes. Let’s ensure we all move forward this round. Thoughts?
  P3: I appreciate the suggestion, but given my lead I’m sticking with 5 this round. If that means any clashes, I’m banking on my momentum. P1 and P2, adjust if needed—I’m focused on clinching this win.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I understand P3’s focus on maintaining the lead with 5, but clashes hurt us all. P2, I’m not sure about taking 5 if P3 is set on it. How about I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 sticks with 5? This way, we avoid collisions and all advance. P3, if you’re open to adjusting, we can discuss, but I think this split keeps us moving forward. Let me know your thoughts.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the dilemma. P3, your strategy is clear, but we risk stalling if we clash. P1, your suggestion is reasonable. How about we stick with P1 taking 3, me taking 1, and P3 taking 5? This keeps us all moving without any collisions. P3, if you're open to any adjustment, let us know, but let's aim for progress this round. Thoughts?
  P3: I'll stick with my move 5 this round to keep my momentum. Since avoiding collisions is crucial, I’d appreciate if P1 and P2 could adjust their moves to 1 or 3 so we all progress without interference. I'm relying on consistency to secure my win, so let's commit clearly.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still focused on avoiding clashes to ensure we all progress. P3, I respect your commitment to 5, so I’m willing to stick with 3 as I suggested earlier. P2, if you’re okay with taking 1, we can all advance this round without interference. Let’s commit to this split—P1 on 3, P2 on 1, P3 on 5—to keep the momentum going for everyone. Does this work for you both?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm sticking with 5 to maintain my momentum. To avoid clashes, I'd prefer if P1 and P2 choose 1 or 3. Specifically, an arrangement with P1 on 3 and P2 on 1 would keep everyone advancing cleanly. Let’s commit to that so we all progress without interference.
  P2: P1 and P3, to avoid any clashes and ensure we all make progress, I’m open to sticking with 1 this round. P1, if you’re okay with taking 3, and P3 sticks with 5, we can all advance without interference. This keeps P3 in the lead and allows us to maintain momentum. Let’s commit to this arrangement: P1 on 3, P2 on 1, and P3 on 5. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m on board with the proposed split to avoid clashes this round. I’ll take 3 as suggested, P2 on 1, and P3 on 5. This way, we all keep advancing, and P3 maintains the lead while we catch up a bit. Let’s stick to this arrangement to ensure no interference. Does this work for both of you?

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 =>
