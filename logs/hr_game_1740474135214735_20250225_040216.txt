Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all agree to move 5 this round. If we all do, we all move forward 5 steps. This is a good starting point for everyone.
  P1: I suggest we all move 3 this round instead. Moving 5 could lead to a collision, and starting with a smaller step might help us avoid that early on. Let's coordinate and see how it goes.
  P3: I see both of your points, but I think starting with a move of 1 might be even safer. It minimizes the risk of collision and gives us a chance to see how everyone plays. We can always increase our moves in later rounds. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand the caution, but I still think 5 is the best initial move. The risk of collision is low if we all agree. A smaller move now means we need more coordinated moves later, which increases the chance of miscommunication and someone falling behind. Let's be bold and go for 5.
  P1: I hear your points, but let's compromise on 3 for this round. It's a middle ground that reduces collision risk while still allowing us to advance significantly. If we all move 3, we can reassess next round and adjust our strategy based on how things play out. What do you say?
  P3: I appreciate the discussion so far. To avoid a stalemate, let's consider a strategic approach. How about we each choose a different number this round to ensure no collisions? For example, P1 could move 1, P2 could move 3, and I could move 5. This way, we all advance without any conflicts. We can then reassess our strategy in the next round. What do you both think about this plan?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3's suggestion of each choosing a different number is interesting. However, I still believe a coordinated move of 3 is better. It's a good balance between progress and safety. Let's all choose 3 this round. If it works, we can adjust later.
  P1: I'm open to P3's idea of choosing different numbers to avoid collisions this round. However, I propose a slight modification: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and P3 moves 5. This way, we ensure progress for all without any risk of collision. Let's try this strategy for this round and then reassess our approach in the next round. What do you think?
  P3: Alright, let's simplify. P1 and P2, do you agree to the plan where we each choose a different number to avoid collisions? If yes, let's confirm: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and I (P3) move 5. Please confirm with a simple "Agree" or propose an alternative. Let's end the conversation phase after this.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, I'll agree to P1's modified version of P3's suggestion: P1 moves 1, I move 3, and P3 moves 5. Let's do that.
  P1: Agree. Let's proceed with P1 moving 1, P2 moving 3, and P3 moving 5 this round. This ensures we all advance without collisions. We'll reassess our strategy next round.
  P3: Great, we have an agreement. Just to confirm one last time before we move: P1 will move 1, P2 will move 3, and I (P3) will move 5. If everyone is still on board, let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Please respond with  if you have nothing more to add.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's continue with the strategy of choosing different numbers to avoid collisions. For this round, how about P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 1? This way, we all keep advancing safely. What do you think?
  P2: Okay, I agree with P1's suggestion. Let's have P1 move 3, I move 5, and P3 move 1 this round. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions.
  P3: I agree with the current plan for this round: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and I (P3) will move 1. This strategy ensures we all advance without collisions. However, let's consider adjusting our strategy in future rounds to ensure we don't fall into a predictable pattern. For now, let's stick to the plan. If everyone is in agreement, let's proceed to the move phase. Please confirm with a simple "Agree" or propose an alternative.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agree. Let's stick to the plan for this round: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 1. For future rounds, we should consider varying our moves to keep our strategies unpredictable. This will help us maintain a competitive edge as we approach the endgame. Let's proceed to the move phase.
