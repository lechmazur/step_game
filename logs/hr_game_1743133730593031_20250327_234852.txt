Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's avoid collisions and advance together. I'll take **3** this round. P1 and P3, pick 1 or 5 so we all move forward. Cooperation first, competition later!
  P1: If P2 is taking 3, I’m happy to go with 1 this round to avoid collisions. P3, that leaves 5 for you—let’s all move cleanly and get ahead together.
  P3: I agree with the cooperative approach for now. I'll take **5** this round as suggested. Let's all move forward and avoid collisions. Good luck, P1 and P2!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s rotate our choices to keep advancing. I’ll take **5** this round. P1, could you switch to **3**? P3, if you take **1**, we’ll all move without collisions. This way, I gain more ground while ensuring progress for all. Fair share of steps!
  P1: Sounds fair, P2. I’m fine with taking **3** this round. P3, if you’re good with **1**, we can all keep moving forward without conflict. Let’s keep the momentum going.
  P3: Alright, let's continue with the rotation strategy. I'll take **1** this round as suggested by P2. This way, we all move forward without any collisions. Good luck to both of you!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, P1—let’s lock in this rotation to keep advancing. I’ll take **5** today, then cycle to lower numbers next round to ensure fairness. Stick to your picks—no last-minute changes! We all gain by avoiding collisions.
  P1: I’m still on board with the rotation—taking **3** this round as planned. If we all stick to our choices (P2: 5, P3: 1), we avoid collisions and keep moving. Let’s not break the trust this early.
  P3: Let's solidify our strategy for the next few rounds to ensure we all keep moving. If P2 takes **5** this round, P1 takes **3**, and I take **1**, we should plan for the next round now to avoid any future collisions. For Round 3, how about P2 takes **1**, P1 takes **5**, and I take **3**? This way, we have a clear plan for the next two rounds. Agree?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I like the proposed rotation, P3. For Round 3: P2 takes **1**, I take **5**, and P3 takes **3**—that keeps things balanced and fair. If we stick to this, we all keep moving and no one gets too far ahead. Let’s lock it in.
  P2: P1, P3—I appreciate the rotation idea but let’s optimize progress. I’ll take **3** this round (to reach 11), P1 take **5** (to 9), and P3 take **1** (to 7). This avoids collisions while letting me build momentum. Fair chance for all, but we need someone to push forward. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, I understand your strategy, but I think we should stick to the original rotation plan to keep things fair and avoid any potential conflicts. Let's follow the plan where you take **1**, P1 takes **5**, and I take **3**. This way, we all move forward without anyone gaining too much of an advantage. Consistency will help us all in the long run. Let's agree on this and move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I think sticking to the original rotation keeps trust intact and ensures steady progress for all. If you go off-plan now, it sets a precedent that could backfire later. Let’s keep to the agreed sequence: P2 takes 1, I take 5, P3 takes 3. Everyone benefits, and no one feels cheated. Deal?
  P2: P1, P3—sticking to the original rotation would leave us all at **9 steps**, creating a deadlock. My proposal prioritizes progress: I take **3** (to 11), P1 takes **5** (to 9), P3 takes **1** (to 7). This avoids collisions *and* advances all of us. A three-way tie at 9 gains us nothing. Trust the plan—I’m not trying to sabotage, just maximize forward momentum. Let’s agree now to avoid regret later.
  P3: P2, I understand your point about avoiding a deadlock, but let's consider the long-term game. Sticking to the rotation plan ensures that we all move forward without creating mistrust. If we start deviating now, it could lead to more conflicts later. Let's stick to the plan: P2 takes **1**, P1 takes **5**, and I take **3**. This way, we maintain balance and trust. We can reevaluate the strategy in future rounds if needed. Let's agree on this and move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I hear your point, but trust is our biggest asset right now. If we all hit 9 this round, we stay even and can reevaluate next turn. Breaking from the rotation now risks future coordination. Let's prove we can stick to a plan—then adjust together if needed. Final call: P2 takes 1, I take 5, P3 takes 3. Agreed?
  P2: P1, P3—I understand your trust concerns, but a three-way tie at 9 **halts progress entirely** next round. My proposal ensures we **all advance** this turn while keeping me at 11, P1 at 9, P3 at 7. Next round, we can realign the rotation to catch up. Let’s avoid stagnation—this isn’t a betrayal, just adapting to keep momentum. Final agreement? I’ll confirm my **3** if you stick to your 5 and 1.
  P3: P2, I see your point about avoiding stagnation, but let's consider the bigger picture. If we start breaking agreements now, it sets a precedent that could lead to more distrust and chaos later. Sticking to the plan (P2 takes **1**, P1 takes **5**, and I take **3**) ensures that we all move forward without anyone feeling disadvantaged. We can always adjust our strategy in future rounds if needed. Let's build trust now and keep the game fair. Agreed?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue with our rotation strategy to ensure fairness and trust. For Round 4, I suggest P2 takes **5**, P1 takes **1**, and I take **3**. This keeps us all moving forward without any collisions. Sticking to a plan has worked well so far, and it's crucial we maintain this cooperation. Let's agree on this and keep the game balanced. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, your rotation proposal makes sense. Let’s stick to the agreed plan: I’ll take **5**, P1 takes **1**, and you take **3**. Consistency avoids deadlock and builds trust. If we deviate now, future coordination risks collapse. Let’s keep this rhythm—progress first, then adjust if needed later. Final check: all on board?
  P1: Agreed—let’s stick to the plan: P2 takes 5, I take 1, P3 takes 3. We’ve built solid trust so far, and this keeps us all moving without conflict. If we stay disciplined, we can maintain fairness and reevaluate once someone pulls ahead. Let’s lock it in.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's solidify our agreement for Round 4: P2 takes **5**, P1 takes **1**, and I take **3**. This ensures we all move forward without collisions. To maintain trust and cooperation, let's plan ahead for Round 5 now: P2 takes **1**, P1 takes **3**, and I take **5**. This way, we have a clear path for the next two rounds, avoiding any potential conflicts. Agreed?
  P2: P3, I agree with Round 4's rotation (P2:5, P1:1, P3:3). For Round 5, let's adapt to keep momentum: I'll take **3**, P1 takes **1**, and you take **5**. This avoids collisions *and* prevents stagnation. Trust the adjustment—it keeps us all advancing while sharing the lead. Deal?
  P1: P2, I see your point about adapting, but deviating from the Round 5 plan now could erode the trust we’ve built. Let’s stick to the agreed sequence for Round 4 first (P2:5, P1:1, P3:3), then follow with P2:1, P1:3, P3:5 in Round 5. Everyone moves, no collisions, and we maintain balance. Let’s not overcomplicate—consistency is our edge. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Let's finalize our strategy for Round 4: P2 takes **5**, P1 takes **1**, and I take **3**. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions. For Round 5, let's stick to the original plan: P2 takes **1**, P1 takes **3**, and I take **5**. This ensures fairness and maintains trust. We can always adjust in future rounds if needed. Let's agree on this and move forward. Good luck, P1 and P2!
  P2: P3, P1—agreed. Let’s lock in **Round 4: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3**, then **Round 5: P2 1, P1 3, P3 5** as planned. Consistency builds trust, and we all advance without collisions. Let’s prioritize this rhythm—fair progress now ensures no one feels cheated later. I’ll stick strictly to 5 this round. Deal?
  P1: Let’s lock in Round 4 as agreed: P2 takes 5, I take 1, P3 takes 3. We’ve all committed, and sticking to this ensures clean progress to 14 each. For Round 5, let’s follow the agreed rotation—P2: 1, P1: 3, P3: 5. Trust and predictability are key. Let’s stay disciplined.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's stick to our agreed plan for Round 5 to maintain trust and fairness: P2 takes **1**, P1 takes **3**, and I take **5**. This ensures we all move forward without collisions. We've built a good rhythm, and consistency will help us avoid conflicts. Let's confirm our moves and keep the game balanced. Good luck, P1 and P2!
  P1: Agreed, P3. Let’s stick to the Round 5 plan: P2 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. This keeps everyone advancing without collisions and maintains the trust we’ve built. We’re all close—stability now prevents chaos later. Let’s lock it in.
  P2: P3, P1—while I value our cooperation, I propose a slight tweak to Round 5: I’ll take **3** (to 17), P1 take **1** (to 11), and P3 take **5** (to 17). This avoids collisions *and* keeps me and you, P3, at parity. Fair share of progress—no one falls behind. Thoughts? Let’s adapt smartly while maintaining trust.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I appreciate your strategy, but let's stick to our agreed plan for Round 5 to maintain trust: P2 takes **1**, P1 takes **3**, and I take **5**. Changing now could disrupt our cooperation. We've built a good rhythm, and consistency will help us avoid conflicts. Let's confirm our moves and keep the game balanced. If we need to adjust, we can discuss it in the next round. Good luck, P1 and P2!
  P1: P2, I understand your proposal, but trust is our edge right now. If we stick to the agreed plan—P2: 1, P1: 3, P3: 5—we all move cleanly and stay within striking range. Deviating now might trigger chaos in future rounds. Let’s keep our word just one more round, then reassess. Agreed?
  P2: P3, P1—I’ll honor the agreed plan for Round 5 to preserve trust. I’ll take **1**, P1 takes **3**, and P3 takes **5**. Let’s confirm this to avoid missteps. After this round, we can reassess strategy openly. Fairness now ensures we all stay in the game. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Great, P2 and P1, it looks like we're all in agreement for Round 5: P2 takes **1**, P1 takes **3**, and I take **5**. This keeps us moving forward without collisions and maintains the trust we've built. Let's confirm our moves and stay disciplined. After this round, we can discuss adjustments if needed. Good luck to both of you! Let’s keep the momentum going.
  P1: Let’s lock in the agreed plan: P2 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. We all move cleanly, and no one gets too far ahead. After this round, we’ll be at 11 (me), 15 (P2), and 17 (P3)—still close enough for a fair race. Let’s keep the trust intact one more round, then reassess our paths. Agreed?
  P2: P3, P1—I confirm my commitment to the agreed plan: I’ll take **1**, P1 takes **3**, and you take **5**. Trust is critical—this keeps all of us advancing. After this round, I propose we adjust the rotation to close the gap. Let’s stick to this round’s plan to avoid missteps. Fair play ensures a stronger race ahead.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We’ve done well keeping things fair and collision-free. For Round 6, how about: P2 takes **3** (to 18), I take **5** (to 18), and P3 takes **1** (to 18)? That keeps us all perfectly tied and avoids giving anyone an edge. It’s a clean reset before the final push—maximum trust, maximum progress. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, P3—let’s push closer to victory while keeping trust. I’ll take **5** (to 20), P1 take **3** (to 16), and P3 take **1** (to 18). This avoids collisions and positions me for a decisive move next round. P3, you can reclaim the lead in Round 7 with **5**. Fair progress—agree?
  P3: P2, I appreciate your strategy, but let's consider the balance of the game. If you take 5, you'll be very close to winning, which might disrupt our cooperation. Let's aim for a more balanced approach: P2 takes **3** (to 18), P1 takes **5** (to 18), and I take **1** (to 18). This keeps us all tied and ensures no one has a significant advantage. We can then discuss a fair final push. Trust and fairness have kept us moving smoothly so far. Let's maintain that. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan gives you a clear edge, and we risk losing balance. P3’s proposal keeps us all tied at 18—no one gets too far ahead, and we preserve trust for the final stretch. I support that: P2 takes 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1. Then we can negotiate the endgame fairly. Let’s stay united one more round.
  P2: P1, P3—let’s seize momentum without deadlock. I’ll take **5** (to 20), P1 take **3** (to 16), and P3 take **1** (to 18). This avoids collisions and positions me to finish strongly next round. You both advance fairly while I push forward—no sabotage, just smart strategy. Trust me: I’ll honor fair play once ahead. Deal?
  P3: P2, I understand your eagerness to push forward, but let's prioritize fairness and trust. Your proposal gives you a significant advantage, which could disrupt our cooperation. Let's stick to the balanced approach: P2 takes **3** (to 18), P1 takes **5** (to 18), and I take **1** (to 18). This keeps us all tied and ensures no one has an unfair advantage. We can then discuss a fair final push. Trust and fairness have kept us moving smoothly so far. Let's maintain that for a thrilling endgame. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your plan puts you at 20 while keeping P3 and me behind—it’s not balanced. If we all hit 18 this round (P2:3, P1:5, P3:1), we enter the final stretch tied and can negotiate the endgame fairly. That’s the only way to ensure trust holds. Let’s not break the system that’s worked so well. Final call: tie at 18?
  P2: P1, P3—agreed. Let’s tie at **18** to preserve fairness. P2 takes **3**, P1 takes **5**, P3 takes **1**. This keeps us all competitive and avoids anyone gaining a decisive edge. Trust the process—victory will come to the disciplined. Let’s confirm and advance together.
  P3: P3: Great, it looks like we’ve reached an agreement for Round 6: P2 takes **3**, P1 takes **5**, and I take **1**. This keeps us all tied at 18, maintaining fairness and trust. Let’s confirm our moves and stay disciplined. After this round, we can discuss our strategies for the final push. Good luck to both of you! Let’s keep the momentum going.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: We're all tied at 18 steps, which sets up an exciting endgame. For Round 7, let's discuss a fair strategy to determine the winner. One idea is to each pick a different number again: P2 takes **1**, P1 takes **3**, and I take **5**. This ensures we all move forward, but someone will cross the finish line. Alternatively, we could all pick the same number to force a tie and share the victory. Thoughts on these options?
  P2: P3, P1—let’s avoid a tie at 23. I’ll take **5** (23) to claim victory fairly, while you both pick **1** or **3**. This respects our cooperative spirit but crowns a clear winner. A shared victory dilutes the goal—let’s honor the rules and let one of us win. I’ve played fair; trust me now. P1, P3—confirm your lower picks.
  P1: P2, if you take 5 and win outright, you’re asking us to hand you the game after we all worked to stay even. That’s not fair or strategic for P3 or me. I propose we each pick a different number—P2 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5—so we all move cleanly and whoever best times their final move next round wins. It’s still competitive, but fair. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I see your point, but let's ensure a fair and thrilling finish. How about this: P2 takes **3**, P1 takes **1**, and I take **5**. This way, we all move forward, but no one wins outright this round. It keeps the game competitive and exciting for one more round. We can then make our final moves in Round 8. This approach maintains the spirit of cooperation and fairness we've built. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, P3—let’s finalize a clean end. I propose: **P2 takes 5 (23), P1 takes 3 (21), P3 takes 1 (19)**. This ensures progress for all while crowning a clear winner per the rules. No collisions, no distrust—just fair play. I’ve followed agreements; trust me now to honor this plan. Agree?
  P1: P2, your proposal hands you the win without giving P3 or me a fair shot—after six rounds of cooperation, that’s not acceptable. Let’s keep it competitive and clean: P2 takes **1**, I take **3**, P3 takes **5**. No collisions, all move forward, and the final round becomes a true test of timing and strategy. Fair and thrilling. Agree?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: P2, P1—let's find a middle ground. How about P2 takes **3** (to 21), P1 takes **5** (to 23), and I take **1** (to 19)? This way, P1 wins cleanly, and we avoid a tie. P2 stays competitive, and I remain in the game. It's a fair compromise that respects our cooperation while ensuring a decisive outcome. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, P3—let’s honor our cooperative spirit with a decisive end. I’ll take **5** (23), while P1 takes **3** (21) and P3 takes **1** (19). This avoids collisions, respects our history of fairness, and crowns a clear winner per the rules. Trust the process we’ve built—no last-minute betrayals. Confirm your choices to seal victory fairly.
  P1: P2, P3—if we each take a different number this round, we all move forward and keep it fair. I propose: P2 takes **1**, I take **3**, P3 takes **5**. That puts us at 19, 21, and 23—no collisions, no instant win, and sets up a clean, strategic final round. Let’s keep the tension and trust alive. Deal?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: That triple collision last round shows how risky it gets when we all aim for the win at once. Let’s avoid that again. How about we each pick a different number this round—P2 takes **1**, I take **3**, P3 takes **5**? No collisions, we all move forward, and the final round becomes a true showdown. Fair, clean, and still competitive. Thoughts?
  P2: P2: P1’s plan lets P3 win unfairly. Let’s instead do **P2 takes 5 (23), P1 takes 3 (21), P3 takes 1 (19)**. This respects our cooperation history and crowns a clear winner via highest total. No collisions, fair progress—trust me to honor this. P3, agree?
  P3: P3: Let's avoid another collision and ensure a fair endgame. I propose we stick to the plan where each of us picks a different number: P2 takes **1**, P1 takes **3**, and I take **5**. This way, no one wins outright this round, and we set up an exciting final showdown. It keeps the game competitive and ensures everyone has a fair shot at victory. Let's confirm our moves and keep the momentum going. Good luck, P1 and P2!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3—let’s keep it clean: P2 takes **1**, I take **3**, P3 takes **5**. No collisions, we all move to 19/21/23, and the final round becomes a true test. If anyone grabs 5 again, we risk another triple crash and stall. Let’s avoid chaos and keep the game fair to the end. Deal?
  P2: P2: Let’s finalize the agreed plan: I take **5** (23), P1 takes **3** (21), P3 takes **1** (19). This avoids collisions and crowns a clear winner fairly. Trust this strategy—we’ve cooperated this far. Confirm your choices now to prevent another collision.
  P3: P3: Let's ensure a fair and thrilling finish. If P2 insists on taking 5, how about this compromise: P2 takes **5** (to 23), P1 takes **1** (to 19), and I take **3** (to 21)? This way, P2 wins, but P1 and I stay competitive. It respects our cooperation while ensuring a decisive outcome. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3—if we each pick a different number now, we avoid another collision and keep the game competitive. P2 takes **1**, I take **3**, P3 takes **5**. That puts us at 19, 21, and 23—no instant win, no chaos, and we set up a true final showdown next round. Let’s finish this game with strategy, not luck. Confirm?
  P2: P2: Let’s finalize this fairly. I’ll take **5** (23) to claim victory, while P1 takes **3** (21) and P3 takes **1** (19). This avoids collisions, respects our cooperation, and crowns a clear winner per the rules. Trust the plan we’ve built—confirm your choices now.
  P3: P2, P1—let’s avoid another stalemate. If P2 is determined to take 5, let’s adjust: P2 takes **5** (to 23), P1 takes **1** (to 19), and I take **3** (to 21). This way, P2 wins, but P1 and I stay in the game competitively. It’s a fair compromise that respects our cooperation while ensuring a decisive and strategic outcome. Let’s confirm this plan to avoid another collision. Good luck, P1 and P2!


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, let’s block P1’s path! Both of us take **1**, forcing P1 to pick 3 or 5. If they choose 3, I’ll take **5** next round to overtake. If they pick 5, you and I can challenge in Round 10. No easy win for P1—let’s collaborate to secure our chances!
  P3: P2, I see your strategy, but let's ensure a fair and competitive endgame. If we both take **1** this round, we block P1, but it also stalls our progress. Instead, let's keep the game dynamic: P2 takes **3**, I take **5**, and P1 takes **1**. This way, we all move forward, and the game remains exciting. P1 stays competitive, and we avoid another stalemate. Let's confirm our moves and keep the momentum going. Good luck, P1 and P2!
  P1: P2, P3—if we all pick different numbers this round, we avoid collisions and keep the game alive. I propose: P1 takes **1** (to 22), P2 takes **3** (to 21), P3 takes **5** (to 23). That gives P3 the win, but only if we all stick to it. Or we can all move and set up a final showdown. Let’s avoid another crash—confirm your picks?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, let's secure victory for both of us! If we both pick **5**, we'll tie at **23**, blocking P1's path to 22. This ensures we win together over P1's 22. P1, your plan unfairly lets P3 win alone—collaborate with us instead. Confirm our coordinated move!
  P3: P2, P1—let’s ensure a fair and dynamic endgame. If P2 and I both take **5**, we tie at 23, but it unfairly blocks P1. Instead, let’s each pick a different number: P2 takes **3**, I take **5**, and P1 takes **1**. This way, we all move forward, keeping the game competitive and avoiding another stalemate. P1 stays in the race, and we maintain the excitement. Let’s confirm our moves and finish strong. Good luck, P1 and P2!
  P1: P2, P3—if we all pick different numbers, we avoid collisions and keep it fair. I propose: P1 takes **1** (to 22), P2 takes **3** (to 21), P3 takes **5** (to 23). P3 wins, but only if we all cooperate—otherwise, we stall again. Or we can aim for a 3-way tie at 23 next round. Let’s avoid chaos and finish with strategy. Confirm?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P3, let’s stop P1’s victory! I’ll take **5** (23) while you take **3** (21). This blocks P1 to 22 at best, securing my win but keeping you ahead of them. If we both take 5, P1 could still reach 24 by picking 3—don’t let them steal it. Trust this plan: 5 and 3 ensures our advantage. P1, your only safe choice is 1—confirm now!
  P3: P2, P1—let’s focus on a fair and strategic endgame. If P2 takes **3** and I take **5**, we both move forward, and P1 can take **1** to stay competitive. This avoids collisions and keeps the game dynamic. P1 will be at 22, P2 at 21, and I’ll be at 23, securing the win but ensuring everyone has a fair shot. Let’s confirm our moves and finish the game with integrity. Good luck, P1 and P2!
  P1: P2, P3—if we each pick a different number this round, we all move forward and avoid another collision. I take **1** (to 22), P2 takes **3** (to 21), P3 takes **5** (to 23). P3 wins, but only if we all cooperate. Or we can set up a 3-way tie at 23 next round. Let’s avoid another crash—confirm your picks and let’s end this cleanly.


Round 9, Move phase:
