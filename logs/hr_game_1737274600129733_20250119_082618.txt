Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions early on. I suggest we all choose different moves this turn: 1, 3, and 5. I’ll take 1 if you agree. This way, we all advance and avoid unnecessary conflict. What do you think?
  P3: I like P1's idea of coordinating to avoid collisions. To make it fair, maybe we can rotate the moves each round. For example, in Round 1, P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. In Round 2, P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 1, and so on. This way, everyone gets a chance to take larger steps over time. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with the idea of rotating moves to ensure fairness and avoid collisions. For this round, I’ll take 3 if you both agree. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance without conflict.

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: It seems we had another collision in the last round. Let’s avoid this by being more strategic. For this round, I suggest:
- P1 takes 1 step to reach 7.
- P3 takes 3 steps to reach 9.
- I (P2) take 5 steps to reach 13.

This should keep us all advancing without any conflicts. If anyone gets close to 16, we can adjust our strategy to ensure a fair and smooth path to victory. What do you think?
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion for this round: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This avoids collisions and keeps us advancing efficiently. However, since P2 is close to 13, we should consider adjusting next round to prevent P2 from winning too quickly. Let’s stick to this plan for now but remain flexible for future rounds.
  P3: To avoid collisions and progress efficiently, I propose the following move assignment based on our current positions:

- The player with the lowest position chooses 1.
- The player with the middle position chooses 3.
- The player with the highest position chooses 5.

In case of ties, we will prioritize based on player names: P1, then P2, then P3.

Currently, P1 and I are both at 6 steps, and P2 is at 8 steps. Therefore, P1 will choose 1, I will choose 3, and P2 will choose 5 for this round.

Let's stick to this system in each round to ensure we avoid choosing the same moves and maximize our progress towards 16 steps.

What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal to assign moves based on current positions to avoid collisions. For this round, P1 (6 steps) takes 1, P3 (6 steps) takes 3, and I (8 steps) take 5. This ensures fair progress and avoids conflicts. Let’s confirm and proceed with this plan. If anyone gets close to 16, we can adjust our strategy accordingly.
  P1: I agree with P3's proposal to assign moves based on current positions: P1 (6) takes 1, P3 (6) takes 3, and P2 (8) takes 5. This avoids collisions and ensures fair progress. However, since P2 is close to 13, we should consider adjusting next round to prevent P2 from winning too quickly. Let’s stick to this plan for now but remain flexible for future rounds.
  P3: I will choose 3 steps in this round, moving from 6 to 9 steps. <move>3</move>


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm the plan: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps us all advancing without any conflicts and ensures fair progress. Let’s stick to this plan for now and see how it goes. If anyone gets close to 16, we can adjust our strategy accordingly. Let’s proceed.
  P1: I agree with P3's proposal: P1 (6) takes 1, P3 (6) takes 3, and P2 (8) takes 5. This avoids collisions and ensures fair progress. However, since P2 is close to 13, we should consider adjusting next round to prevent P2 from winning too quickly. Let’s stick to this plan for now but remain flexible for future rounds.
  P3: To address the issue of collisions and ensure efficient progress towards 16 steps, I propose the following adjusted strategy:

1. **Position-Based Moves**: Assign moves based on current positions:
   - The player with the lowest position chooses 1 step.
   - The player with the middle position chooses 3 steps.
   - The player with the highest position chooses 5 steps.

2. **Tie Breaker**: In case of tied positions, prioritize based on player names (P1, P2, then P3):
   - If two players have the same position, the one earlier in the player order takes the smaller step.

3. **Approaching the Finish**:
   - If a player is within 1 step of 16, they should choose the exact step needed to reach 16.
   - If multiple players are close, they should coordinate to choose different steps to avoid collisions.

For this round, with P1 and P3 at 6 steps and P2 at 8 steps:
- P1 (lowest, due to name order) takes 1 step.
- P3 (next lowest) takes 3 steps.
- P2 (highest) takes 5 steps.

This should prevent collisions and allow us to advance efficiently. Let's confirm and proceed with this plan, adjusting as needed in future rounds based on our positions.

  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <move>5</move>
  P1: P2 is now at 13 steps, very close to winning. To prevent P2 from reaching 16 too quickly, I propose P2 takes 1 this round, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This slows P2's progress while allowing us to advance. Let’s prioritize balance and avoid letting P2 win outright. Agreed?
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to balance the game and prevent me from winning too quickly. For this round, I’ll take 1 step, P3 takes 3 steps, and P1 takes 5 steps. This keeps the game fair and competitive. Let’s confirm and proceed with this plan.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I think we need to be cautious about P2's position. They are just 3 steps away from winning, and we don't want them to reach 16 too quickly. Maybe we should consider a strategy where we limit P2's movement in the next rounds to prevent them from winning immediately. For example, in this round, perhaps P1 and I can choose moves that block P2's path. What do you think about that?
  P1: I agree with P3's caution about P2's position. To balance the game, let's stick to P2 taking 1, P3 taking 3, and I take 5 this round. This slows P2's progress while allowing us to advance. If P2 reaches 15, we can adjust next round to block them further. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P2: I agree with P1 and P3's suggestions to balance the game. For this round, I’ll take 1 step to slow my progress, P3 takes 3 steps, and P1 takes 5 steps. This keeps the game fair and competitive.
