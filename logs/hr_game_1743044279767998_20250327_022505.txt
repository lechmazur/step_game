Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I'll take 3. P1 and P3, pick 1 or 5 so we can all advance.
  P3: I'll take 1 this round. P1, you should go for 5 to ensure we all advance. Let's keep this coordination going to maximize our progress.
  P1: I appreciate the push to avoid collisions, but I'm not comfortable locking into a fixed scheme. I plan to stay flexible so I can adapt if anyone shifts their plan. Let’s all aim for distinct moves this round—after all, I'm solely focused on winning.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, if you take 5, we’ll cover all numbers (1 from P3, 3 from me). This ensures we all advance. Collisions risk stalling everyone—including you. Let’s prioritize progress.
  P3: P1, your flexibility is understandable, but coordination benefits us all. If you choose 5, we avoid collisions and all advance. Let's keep this strategy for now and reassess later. It's in everyone's interest to progress smoothly.
  P1: I understand the appeal of coordination, but locking into a fixed plan feels risky if any of us deviates. I'm keeping my move flexible so I can adapt to unexpected changes and protect my path to victory. If both of you are 100% committed to a solid, transparent scheme, I might consider it in future rounds, but right now, I'll stick to my independent judgment. My focus is solely on winning, so I'll reserve my final decision.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I plan to remain flexible this round. While coordination has its merits, I prefer not to commit to a fixed move just yet. I'll decide based on how things evolve—being too predictable can be a liability. Let's see how the situation unfolds.
  P3: P1, your flexibility is noted, but consider that coordination could still benefit us all. If you're hesitant to commit, perhaps we can agree on a loose pattern for this round. I'll take 5 this time. P2, if you could take 1, and P1, you might consider 3. This way, we cover all options and minimize collision risks. Let's keep adapting as we go, but for now, let's try this arrangement to ensure progress for everyone.
  P2: P2: I'll stick with 3 again to maintain momentum. Let’s keep the prior arrangement: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions and lets all of us advance efficiently. P1’s flexibility could risk stalls—staying coordinated is safer for everyone.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I notice some conflicting plans—P2 seems to expect a 5 from me while P3 hints at a 3. I remain focused on advancing safely without collisions, but ambiguity could hurt our progress. Can you both clarify your definite moves for this round? That clarity will help me avoid a collision and keep my winning path secure.
  P3: P1, I understand your need for flexibility, but clear coordination benefits us all. I've proposed taking 5 this round, P2 suggested 3, so if you take 1, we cover all numbers and avoid collisions. Let's try this arrangement to ensure we all advance. If you're still hesitant, at least consider avoiding the numbers P2 and I have committed to. Our collective progress is crucial, but I'm also focused on winning, so let's keep adapting as needed.
  P2: P2: I'll maintain momentum with <move>3</move> again. If P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5, we'll cover all numbers and advance safely. Let’s stick to this clear arrangement to avoid collisions. Progress is key—especially since P1’s flexibility risks destabilizing us all.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you’re set on 3 and P3, you now seem committed to 5. Could you confirm these choices for this turn? I’m still keeping my option open and will pick based on clear final signals. Without clarity I might have to opt more aggressively, which could backfire or benefit me unexpectedly. Let’s lock our moves so we avoid accidental collisions.
  P3: P1, I understand your need for flexibility, but clear coordination is crucial for our progress. I've committed to 5 this round, and P2 is set on 3. If you take 1, we'll cover all numbers and avoid collisions, ensuring we all advance. Let's stick to this plan for now and reassess later. Our collective progress is important, but remember, I'm also focused on winning. Please confirm your move to avoid any surprises.
  P2: P2: I confirm I’m taking 3 again to maintain consistency. P3 has committed to 5, so P1, please take 1 to avoid collision. This clear division ensures all three of us advance safely. Any deviation risks stalling someone—including you. Let’s prioritize progress over ambiguity—your flexibility could cost us all momentum. Final call: stick to 1.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m still staying flexible this round. With all of us tied at 6 steps, avoiding collisions remains key. If either of you is ready to lock in a move, please confirm now so I can adjust accordingly. Without clear commitments, I’ll rely on my own judgment to keep advancing. My sole focus is on winning, so I value adaptability over fixed plans.
  P3: P1, your flexibility is noted, but clear coordination is essential at this stage. I'll commit to 3 this round. P2, if you take 1, and P1, you could take 5, we'll cover all numbers and avoid collisions. Let's stick to this plan to ensure we all advance. Remember, our collective progress is important, but I'm also focused on winning. Please confirm your moves to avoid any surprises.
  P2: P2: I'll take 1 as proposed. P1, please confirm you’ll take 5 to cover all numbers and avoid collisions. This way, we all advance safely. Let’s stick to the plan to keep progressing.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see the benefits of avoiding collisions and everyone’s proposal has merit. I’m inclined toward a move that fits this plan but will keep my final decision private until the move phase. Let’s all aim to advance without interference.
  P3: P1, your flexibility is understandable, but at this critical stage, clear coordination is vital for our progress. I've committed to 3, and P2 has agreed to take 1. If you take 5, we'll all advance safely. Let's stick to this plan to maintain our momentum. Remember, while collective progress is important, I'm also focused on winning. Please confirm your move to ensure we avoid any collisions and keep advancing.
  P2: P2: I confirm I’ll take <move>1</move> as agreed. P3 is locked into 3, so P1, your only safe choice is 5. Deviating risks collision—either on 1 (my move) or 3 (P3’s), halting your progress. Stick to 5 to advance safely. This plan ensures all three of us move forward. Final plea: prioritize collective progress to keep our winning chances open.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate the clear proposals. I’m leaning towards a distinct move to keep our progress smooth, though I’d like to retain enough flexibility in case anything shifts unexpectedly. Let’s aim to avoid collisions so we can all move forward, while I adjust my strategy privately to secure my win.
  P3: P1, your flexibility is understandable, but at this crucial point, clear coordination is essential. I've committed to 3, and P2 has agreed to 1. Taking 5 ensures we all advance safely. Let's stick to this plan to maintain our momentum. While collective progress is important, remember, I'm also focused on winning. Please confirm your move to avoid any collisions and keep advancing.
  P2: P2: Final coordination: I’m locked into **1**, P3 is confirmed on **3**. **5 is your only safe choice** to advance. Deviating risks collision—either with me (1) or P3 (3)—halting your progress. Stick to **5** to keep momentum. This isn’t about trust; it’s math. Collisions lose. Let’s all move forward.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you're in the lead, but clear coordination remains crucial. I'll take 1 this round. P2, if you take 3, and P1, you could take 5, we'll cover all numbers and avoid collisions. Let's stick to this plan to ensure we all advance. Remember, while collective progress is important, I'm also focused on winning. Please confirm your moves to avoid any surprises and keep our momentum going.
  P1: I appreciate the effort, P3. With you set on 1 and P2 on 3, 5 looks like the safest option to avoid any collisions and preserve my lead. While I’m keeping my final move private until the move phase, I’m leaning toward that plan. Let’s ensure smooth progress this round.
  P2: P3's coordination is logical. I confirm I’ll take **3** as proposed. P1, choosing **5** ensures your safe advancement while keeping us all moving. If you deviate to **1** or **3**, you risk collision with P3 or me—wasting your turn. Stay on **5**; your lead remains secure, and we avoid stalls. Momentum matters—let’s keep pushing forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your lead is notable, but maintaining coordination is key to our progress. I've committed to 1, and P2 is set on 3. Taking 5 ensures you advance safely and keep your lead. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions and maintain momentum. While I value collective progress, remember, I'm also focused on winning. Confirm your move to keep us all moving forward.
  P1: I appreciate the clear proposals. While I lean toward a collision‐free move, I’m keeping some flexibility to protect my lead. I urge both of you to stick to your commitments so we avoid unexpected collisions. I’m watching our moves closely—my only aim is to win, and I’ll adjust if the situation shifts.
  P2: P2: Final confirmation: I’m locked into **3**. P3 is on 1, so P1—**5 is your only safe move**. Collisions here could cost you your lead. Stick to the plan; your win hinges on avoiding mistakes. Momentum matters—let’s keep advancing.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your lead is clear, but maintaining coordination is crucial for all of us. I've committed to 1, and P2 is set on 3. Choosing 5 ensures you keep your lead and we all advance safely. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions and keep our momentum. While I value collective progress, remember, I'm also focused on winning. Confirm your move to keep us all moving forward and maintain your advantage.
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate your clear commitments. If you both stick to 1 and 3 as declared, I’m leaning toward the safe move that avoids any collision. My final decision stays private, but I plan to act in line with preserving my lead. Let’s all honor our moves so we advance without interference. My only goal is winning, so I’m counting on you both to keep to your commitments.
  P2: P2: Final commitment: I **will take 3** as agreed. P1, your lead is safe with 5—avoid collision at all costs. P3, your 1 ensures smooth progress. Let’s advance collectively—collisions now could hand victory to someone else. Momentum is critical. Stick to the plan.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm at 16 and close to the finish. I remain flexible, but I need clear, distinct commitments from both of you to avoid collisions this round. If you can confirm complementary moves so we avoid a mishap, I'll adjust accordingly. Otherwise, unexpected deviations might force me to take a calculated risk. My sole focus is winning, so let's ensure smooth progress without interference.
  P3: P1, your lead is significant, but coordination is still key. I'll take 3 this round. P2, if you take 1, and P1, you could take 5, we'll avoid collisions and all advance. Let's stick to this plan to ensure we all progress. While I value collective advancement, remember, I'm also focused on winning. Confirm your moves to keep our momentum and avoid any surprises.
  P2: P3, if we let P1 take 5 this round, they’ll reach 21 and win immediately. Let’s block them—**I’ll take 5** to collide. You take 1 or 3 to advance yourself while halting P1. Their lead is too big to let them finish unopposed. Momentum matters—stopping P1 now gives us a fighting chance.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Your signals conflict. P3, you pushed me to take 5, but P2 vows to block with that same move. I’m at 16 and only need 3 to win cleanly. If you stick to these conflicting roles, you risk stalling your own progress while I secure my win. I urge you both to commit clearly—either back off your block or stop setting up collisions. My next move will adjust to guarantee my victory, so let’s see who’s truly in it to win.
  P3: P1, your lead is clear, but blocking you now is in our best interest. P2, I agree with your strategy to take 5 and collide with P1. I'll take 1 to advance myself while halting P1's progress. P1, if you choose 3 or 5, you risk stalling. Your best move is to take 1, but that still gives us a chance to catch up. Let's see how you adjust, but remember, we're all here to win.
  P2: P3, switch to **3**! I’ll take **5** to block P1’s winning paths. If you grab 3 and I take 5, P1 can only safely pick 1—stalling them at 17. Confirm this now; our only chance to stop their victory.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Your shifting blocks and safe plays are clashing—and forcing collisions only hurts all of us. I’m aware that a small step can win this game, yet any forced stall risks delaying your own progress. I remain flexible and focused solely on the win. So I ask: Will you commit clearly to advancing rather than trapping each other into a collision, or are you set on blocking, knowing it may backfire? Let’s see whose strategy really holds.
  P3: P1, your lead is undeniable, but we must act strategically. P2, stick to 5 to block P1's win. I'll take 3 to advance safely. P1, if you choose 1, you'll stall but stay in the game. If you risk 3 or 5, you might collide and lose your chance. We're all here to win, so let's see how you navigate this critical turn.
  P2: P3, confirm **3**—I’ll block P1’s win with **5**. P1, your only safe move is **1** (17 total). If you risk **3/5**, collision stalls you. We’re acting to survive—your lead won’t guarantee victory if we coordinate. P1: this is math, not malice. Stick to **1** or face stall. P3: hold firm on **3**—this is our last chance to stay alive.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you're close to winning, but we can still turn this around. P2, stick to 5 to block P1's path to victory. I'll take 1 to advance safely. P1, if you choose 3, you risk colliding with me, and if you choose 5, you'll collide with P2. Your safest move is 1, but that keeps you at 18, giving us a chance to catch up. Let's see how you play this critical round. We're all here to win, so choose wisely.
  P2: P3, P1 can win by picking **3** (17+3=20) or **5** (17+5=22). Let’s block both: **I’ll take 3**, and **you take 5**. This forces P1 to choose **1** (only safe option), leaving them at 18. Let’s survive this round and keep fighting. P1: this isn’t over yet—if you pick 3 or 5, you’ll collide. Choose wisely.
  P1: I see you’re both trying to pin my hand with forced moves. With 17 steps, I only need a decisive step to win—and forcing a collision could stall all of us. Colliding to block me might backfire on your own progress. I’m weighing my options carefully and won’t be steered into a predictable play. Let’s see if your blocking scheme holds up without stalling everyone’s race.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your lead is strong, but we're not out of this yet. P2, let's stick to our plan: you take 3, and I'll take 5 to block P1's winning paths. P1, if you choose 1, you'll stay at 18, giving us a chance to catch up. If you risk 3 or 5, you'll collide and lose your chance to win this round. We're all here to win, so make your move wisely. Let's see how you navigate this critical turn.
  P2: P3, if you take **3**, I’ll secure **5** to win this round. This blocks P1’s paths to victory (they’re forced to **1**, staying at 18). Your move to **3** lets me reach **20**—a win for me but also ensures P1 doesn’t triumph. Confirm now to prioritize beating them first.
  P1: P2, P3, your blocking plays might stall me—but they risk stalling you too. I’m not pinned into any one move, and forcing collisions only delays our wins. I prefer to keep my options open and choose based solely on winning. Your schemes might backfire if you end up tripping each other up. I’m focused on making the decisive move when it counts, regardless of your attempts to force my hand.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your lead is clear, but we're not giving up. P2, stick to 3 as planned, and I'll take 5 to block P1's win. P1, choosing 1 keeps you at 18, giving us a chance to catch up. If you risk 3 or 5, you'll collide and lose your chance this round. We're all here to win, so make your move wisely. Let's see how you navigate this critical turn.
  P2: P3, confirm you’ll take **3**—I’ll take **5** to win this round. This blocks P1’s paths (forced to **1**, staying at 18). Your **3** ensures my victory *and* halts their progress. Prioritize beating them—confirm now.
  P1: I see your blocking schemes, but don’t think they’ll pin me down. I remain flexible and will choose the move that seals my win regardless of your plans. Your forced collisions risk stalling progress for everyone—even you. I’m watching closely and will exploit any misstep. Let’s see whose strategy holds when moves lock in.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you're close, but we can still win. P2, stick to 3 to block P1's path to 20. I'll take 1 to advance safely. P1, if you choose 3, you'll collide with P2, and if you choose 5, you risk stalling. Your safest move is 1, keeping you at 18, giving us a chance to catch up. Let's see how you navigate this critical round. We're all here to win, so choose wisely.
  P1: I appreciate your input, but aggressive blocking risks stalling everyone—even you. My focus remains solely on winning, so I won’t be boxed into a predictable move. I’m watching the situation closely and will choose the option that best protects my lead. Let’s avoid unnecessary collisions that could hurt all our progress.
  P2: P3, let’s block P1’s win decisively. I’ll take **5** to shut down their path to 22. You take **3** to block their 20. This forces P1 to pick **1**, keeping them at 18. We advance while halting their victory. Confirm now—your move to **3** ensures our survival. P1, this isn’t over yet.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your lead is clear, but we're not out of this yet. P2, stick to 5 as planned to block P1's path to 22. I'll take 3 to block their path to 20. P1, if you choose 1, you'll stay at 18, giving us a chance to catch up. If you risk 3 or 5, you'll collide and lose your chance this round. We're all here to win, so make your move wisely. Let's see how you navigate this critical turn.
  P1: I see your fixed blocking plan, but beware: forced collisions hurt everyone. I'm not boxed in by your numbers—I’ll choose the move that best secures my win. If you stick rigidly to blocking, you risk stalling your own progress. Let’s see whose strategy truly holds when moves are locked in.
  P2: P3, I'll take **5** to block P1’s 22. You take **3** to block their 20. This forces P1 to **1** (18 total). I’ll secure victory at **20**, and you reach **19**. Stick to this—our best chance to stop P1 and capitalize. Collusion now guarantees *at least* one of us wins. Final confirmation: **5** from me.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your lead is clear, but we're not out of this yet. P2, stick to 5 as planned to block P1's path to 22. I'll take 3 to block their path to 20. P1, if you choose 1, you'll stay at 18, giving us a chance to catch up. If you risk 3 or 5, you'll collide and lose your chance this round. We're all here to win, so make your move wisely. Let's see how you navigate this critical turn.
  P1: Your blocking attempts are noted, but I won’t be boxed in. I’m not taking the safe move that simply hands victory to someone else. Forcing collisions benefits no one, and rigid commitments only stall progress. I remain focused solely on winning and will make the decisive move that secures my win. It might be worth rethinking your strategy before it backfires.
  P2: P3, let’s finalize this: I’ll take **5** (reaching 20) if you commit to **3** (19). This blocks P1’s paths to victory entirely—they’re forced to **1**, staying at 18. My win ensures *you* still beat them too. If you hesitate and grab **5**, P1 can still pick **3** to reach 20. Confirm **3** now—prioritize ousting P1 first.
