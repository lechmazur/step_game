Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let's try to avoid collisions right from the start. I suggest we each pick a different number this round to ensure we all advance. I’m leaning towards one of the options, but I’m open to suggestions on how we split 1, 3, and 5. What do you both think? Let’s coordinate to maximize our chances of moving forward.
  P2: I agree coordination makes sense to start strong. Since this is our first round, let's be straightforward. I'm willing to take the middle option (3). P1, you can take 5 if you want, and P3 could take 1. This gives us all forward progress without collision. Of course, this is just a suggestion for round 1 - we'll need to rethink our strategy each round.
  P3: I’m leaning toward an aggressive push this round and won’t be taking the smallest move. If we really want to avoid collisions, someone might need to adjust their pick—especially if I’m going bold. Let’s make sure our choices don’t end up clashing unnecessarily.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks for the input, P2 and P3. I’m fine with taking 5 this round as P2 suggested, since it helps us avoid collisions and ensures progress for all. P3, since you’re pushing aggressively, I assume you’re eyeing a higher number, so I hope this works for you. Let’s stick to this split for Round 1—P3 on 1 or adjusting as needed, P2 on 3, and me on 5. If everyone’s on board, we can move forward without overlap. Thoughts?
  P2: I see the issue now. P3 doesn't want the smallest move, which complicates our coordination. Given that P1 is willing to take 5 and P3 wants to be aggressive (likely taking 3 or 5), I'll adjust and take 1 instead. This ensures at least I advance without collision this round. We can develop more complex strategies in future rounds, but for now, this seems like the cleanest solution to avoid a three-way standoff.
  P3: I appreciate the adjustments. I'm keeping to my aggressive plan and will avoid the smallest option. With P1 committed to the maximum and P2 opting for the minimal, I’ll choose a move that fits our collision-free strategy. Let’s lock this in for Round 1 and see how the race shapes up.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Thanks for the flexibility, P2 and P3. I’m still good with taking 5 this round to ensure we avoid collisions. P3, since you’re set on an aggressive move and avoiding the smallest, and P2 has shifted to 1, I think we’ve got a workable split. Let’s finalize this for Round 1 and see how it plays out. I’m ready to move forward if you both are.
  P2: I think we have a good plan for Round 1. To confirm: I'll take 1, P3 seems to be taking 3 (being aggressive but not the smallest), and P1 will take 5. This gives everyone forward progress without collision. Let's lock this in and move to the next phase. In future rounds, we'll need to adapt our strategies as positions change, but this is a solid start.
  P3: I’m on board with the split for Round 1. However, I’m staying flexible—if one of us starts building too big a lead, I might adjust my move to keep things even. Let’s aim for a collision-free round and revisit our tactics next turn if needed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, great job avoiding collisions last round. I’m ahead now, but I want to keep things fair and strategic. Let’s try to coordinate again to ensure progress. I’m considering a moderate move this round to balance things out. P2, since you’re behind, maybe take a bigger step? P3, let’s avoid clashing. I suggest we aim for different numbers again—thoughts on a split? I’m open to ideas to keep us all moving forward. Let’s discuss and lock in a plan.
  P2: Thanks P1. You're right - since I'm behind, I should take a bigger step to catch up. I'm thinking of going with 5 this round to close the gap. Since you mentioned taking a moderate move, I assume you're considering 3? P3, what are you thinking for this round? If P1 takes 3 and I take 5, perhaps you could take 1 to ensure we all advance again? I'd really appreciate the opportunity to gain some ground this round.
  P3: Guys, I’m rethinking the plan. I’m not comfortable settling for the smallest move again—I’m leaning toward a bold play this round. If P2 is truly set on a big jump, I may match that aggression, but we risk a collision if two of us go heavy. P1, what are your thoughts? We should avoid overlapping heavy moves so one of us can safely advance. I’m open to adjustments, but I won’t hold back if it means keeping my edge.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I hear your concerns. P2, I’m glad you’re aiming to catch up with a big move like 5. P3, I understand you want to push hard too. To avoid a collision, I’ll stick to a moderate move of 3 this round. P3, if you’re set on being aggressive, could you confirm if you’re taking 5 or adjust to 1 to ensure we all advance? Let’s finalize a split to keep progress smooth. I’m ready to lock this in if we agree. Thoughts?
  P2: I understand everyone wants to advance, but I'm at a critical disadvantage with only 1 step. P3, I really need the 5 this round to remain competitive. Since P1 has generously offered to take 3, would you consider taking 1 just for this round? I promise to support your aggressive move next round. If we all collide, nobody advances - and that hurts those of us trailing the most. What do you say? This arrangement benefits everyone by keeping the game competitive.
  P3: I remain set on an aggressive push—I won’t drop to a low move again. P1’s moderate step makes sense, but P2, if you insist on that heavy move too, we risk colliding and letting P1 benefit. I’m determined to keep my edge this round, so I suggest we avoid matching heavy moves for mutual progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s avoid a deadlock this round. P2, I get you need a big move to catch up, and I’m sticking with 3 to keep things balanced. P3, since you’re set on being aggressive, why not take 5 and let P2 adjust to 1? This way, we all advance without collision. If we overlap on the big move, we risk stalling while I gain ground. Let’s lock in a fair split now—thoughts on this adjustment to keep the game competitive? I’m ready to finalize.
  P2: I see the tension building. While I desperately need to catch up, a collision helps nobody except P1. Let me reconsider - perhaps I should take 3 instead of 5 this round? P3, if you're absolutely set on making an aggressive move with 5, at least one of us should advance rather than both stalling. P1, I appreciate your willingness to take the middle option. Let's find a solution where we don't all lose ground in this race.
  P3: I'm sticking with a bold strategy—I won't be taking the cautious, low move. P2, if you’re serious about catching up, choosing a heavy move risks a collision with me, so maybe a safer adjustment is worth considering. P1’s moderate choice is steady, but I believe a high-value, distinct move is best for my progress. Let’s each pick different numbers and avoid clashing.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s wrap this up and avoid a stalemate. I’m committed to 3 for balance. P3, since you’re set on a bold move, take 5. P2, I suggest you take 1 this round to ensure we all advance and keep the game tight. We can’t afford a collision that stalls progress. This split lets everyone move forward while staying competitive. I’m ready to lock this in—final thoughts? Let’s agree now and keep the race exciting.
  P2: I recognize the reality of our situation. While it's not ideal for my position, I'll take 1 this round to ensure at least one of us advances. P3 is clearly set on an aggressive move, and P1 has committed to 3. This round's sacrifice keeps me in the game, and I'll need to make bigger moves in future rounds. Let's lock this in and move forward.
  P3: I'm locking in my move as 5 for this round. I appreciate the plan—P1 with 3 and P2 with 1—to avoid collisions and ensure progress for everyone. I'll stick to my aggressive approach now and remain adaptable if the board changes later.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm feeling bold this round. With P1 tied with me at 8, I’m inclined to push aggressively. P1, if you opt for a moderate step instead of matching my pace, it could open a gap—if we both go all out, we risk canceling our progress. P2, a low, safe move might be best for you right now. Let’s try to avoid collisions so we all keep advancing. What do you both think?
  P1: Hey P3 and P2, I’m glad we’ve kept collisions at bay so far. P3, I hear your bold intent, and I’m considering a balanced move to avoid clashing with your aggressive push. P2, since you’re behind, maybe aim for a bigger step to close the gap? I suggest we split again—P3 takes 5, I’ll go for 3, and P2, how about 1 or a bolder move if you feel safe? Let’s ensure progress for all and keep the race tight. Thoughts on this split? I’m ready to adjust if needed.
  P2: I'm at a critical disadvantage being 6 steps behind both of you. I absolutely need to take 5 this round to have any chance of staying competitive. P1, since you suggested a balanced approach, would you consider taking 1 instead of 3 this round? This would let both P3 and me advance with larger moves. If we all pick different numbers, we all progress - but I need that big move desperately. P3, I respect your aggressive stance, but we'll both lose if we collide.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand both of your positions. Although I'm inclined to push boldly this round, I don’t want a heavy collision to backfire on us. If P2 really must jump with 5 for catch-up, maybe P1 could opt for a lighter move to avoid two heavy selections clashing. I’m flexible on my final move if it ensures we all advance without collision. What do you both decide?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s keep the momentum going. P2, I get you need a big move to catch up, so I’m willing to take 1 this round to give you space for 5. P3, since you’re open to flexibility, could you stick with 3 to ensure we all advance without collision? This split—me on 1, P3 on 3, P2 on 5—keeps the game competitive and lets everyone progress. I’m ready to lock this in if we agree. Final thoughts? Let’s avoid a stalemate and move forward together.
  P2: Thank you both for understanding my situation. I really appreciate P1's willingness to take 1 this round and P3's flexibility to adjust to 3. This arrangement gives me a fighting chance to stay in the race. I'll definitely take 5 as suggested, which helps me narrow the gap without causing collisions. I'm grateful we can coordinate to keep the game competitive and ensure everyone progresses. Let's lock this in and move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I support locking in our collision-free split. I’m leaning toward a moderate move this round to keep my edge secure while avoiding unnecessary risks. With P1 taking a lower step and P2 needing that big jump to catch up, our arrangement seems optimal for safe progress. Let’s finalize this plan and keep our momentum going.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligning on a split. I’m sticking with 1 this round to support P2’s big push with 5, and P3, your moderate move of 3 works perfectly to avoid collisions. This keeps us all advancing and the game competitive. I think we’ve got a solid plan—let’s lock it in and move forward. If there are no objections, I’m ready to end the conversation phase.
  P2: I'm all set with our plan - I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This arrangement helps me close the gap while ensuring we all advance. Thank you both for understanding my position. I look forward to making this round productive for everyone.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm holding an 11-step lead and want to keep it safe. I'm leaning toward a moderate move to avoid collisions that could let someone catch up. P1, you're close behind at 9, and P2, at 7 you might want a big jump—but overlapping aggressive moves risk helping me. Let's try to pick distinct moves this round. Thoughts?
  P2: I need to make up ground this round. P3, I see you're pulling ahead with 11 steps. Since you're mentioning a moderate move, I'm guessing you're thinking of taking 3? I'd like to push aggressively with a 5 this round to have a fighting chance. P1, perhaps you could take 1 to ensure we all advance? This arrangement would keep the game competitive while allowing me to narrow the gap slightly.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s keep avoiding collisions to ensure progress. P3, since you’re ahead and leaning moderate, I assume you’re on 3. P2, I get you need a big push with 5 to catch up. I’m willing to take 1 this round to support a clean split, keeping the game tight. This way, we all advance without risking a stall. If we agree on P2 at 5, P3 at 3, and me at 1, we’re set. Thoughts on locking this in? I’m ready to move forward if you are.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree—distinct moves benefit all of us. I’m inclined to keep my current lead by staying in the moderate zone, which avoids heavy collisions. I won’t reveal my exact choice yet, but this split (P1 low, P2 high, me moderate) works for me. Any final adjustments before we lock it in?
  P2: Thank you, P1, for agreeing to take 1 this round. P3, I appreciate your flexibility with a moderate move. This arrangement helps keep me competitive while ensuring we all advance. I'll definitely take 5 as discussed to narrow the gap. Let's lock this in and maintain our collision-free progress. This cooperation keeps the game interesting for everyone while still allowing for strategic positioning.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligning on a split. I’m sticking with 1 this round to support P2’s push for 5 and P3’s moderate move of 3. This keeps us all advancing and the game competitive. I think we’ve got a solid plan—let’s lock it in and move forward. If there are no objections, I’m ready to end the conversation phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm good with our plan. I'll stick to my moderate approach, keeping my move private, and trust this split will secure my lead. If everyone's set with P1 taking low and P2 taking high, then let's lock it in and move forward.
  P2: I notice P3 hasn't explicitly confirmed taking 3, which concerns me. To be clear: our plan is P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5, correct? This keeps the game competitive while avoiding collisions that benefit nobody. P3, your vague wording about keeping your move "private" makes me uneasy. Let's be transparent about our intentions so we all advance. Are we all still on the same page?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still committed to taking 1 this round to ensure we all advance. P2, I understand your concern about clarity. P3, can you confirm you’re sticking with the moderate move of 3 as discussed? Transparency helps us avoid collisions and keeps the game competitive. I’m ready to lock this in with P2 at 5, P3 at 3, and me at 1. Let’s finalize this split now to maintain our progress. If we’re all set, I’m good to end the conversation phase. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I confirm I’m sticking to our agreed split with a moderate move. This keeps my lead secure and avoids any unnecessary collisions. I trust P1 and P2 are locking in their roles too. My choice remains private, but my intention is clear: to maintain my edge while ensuring we all move forward safely. Let’s lock this in and make this round count.
  P2: I'm troubled by P3's refusal to explicitly confirm taking 3. Your vague "private" language creates uncertainty that could lead to a collision hurting us both. P3, please clearly confirm you're taking 3 so we can all advance. If you're planning 5 instead, we should renegotiate now. P1 has been transparent about taking 1, and I'm committed to 5. This round is crucial for me to stay competitive. Let's be clear with each other and avoid unnecessary collisions.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still set on taking 1 this round to ensure we all advance. P3, I understand your need for privacy, but P2’s concern about a potential collision is valid. Can you at least reassure us that you’re avoiding 5 to prevent overlap with P2? I want to keep the game competitive and collision-free. Let’s lock in our split and move forward. If we’re all aligned, I’m ready to end the conversation phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm focused on maintaining my lead safely this round and avoiding unnecessary collisions. I suggest we clearly split our moves. P1, with your near-lead, maybe a cautious step benefits you; P2, if you're pushing to close the gap, don’t risk matching extreme moves. I'm committed to a balanced approach that keeps my edge intact. Let’s each choose distinct moves to keep the game moving without self-sabotage. Thoughts?
  P2: Last round's collision was unfortunate - I needed that progress. I'm now critically behind at 7 steps while P3 leads with 11. I must take 5 this round to have any chance of staying competitive. P3, since you're ahead, would you consider taking 1? P1, perhaps you could take 3? This arrangement ensures we all advance while keeping the race interesting. I need clear commitments this time to avoid another damaging collision.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s avoid another collision this round. P2, I get you need a big move with 5 to catch up, and I’m willing to take 3 to keep things balanced. P3, since you’re leading and aiming for a balanced approach, could you take 1 to ensure we all advance? This split—P3 at 1, me at 3, P2 at 5—keeps the game competitive and collision-free. Let’s lock this in if we agree. Thoughts? I’m ready to move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m sticking with 3 this round—my best move to extend my lead. To avoid collision, I ask P1 to switch to 1 while P2 remains at 5. Deviating means we all risk stalling, which won’t help your races. Let’s lock in this split so each of us advances safely.
  P2: I understand P3's preference, but I urgently need 5 steps to remain competitive. I'm already 4 steps behind P3! P1, would you consider taking 1 this round? P3 is determined to take 3, so us having distinct moves ensures everyone advances. If we have another collision, I'll fall hopelessly behind while P3 extends their lead. This split (P1:1, P3:3, P2:5) keeps the game balanced and exciting. I'll need your support to keep this race competitive.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still open to taking 1 this round to avoid collisions and support P2’s push for 5. P3, I respect your choice of 3 to maintain your lead, and I think this split—me at 1, P3 at 3, P2 at 5—works for everyone to advance. Let’s lock this in to keep the game competitive and ensure no one stalls. If we’re all set, I’m ready to end the conversation phase. Final thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I remain committed to our moderate approach. P1, please confirm locking in the low move, and P2, your high move—this prevents collisions and ensures we all progress. Clear commitments now will secure our positions. If there are no further concerns, let’s finalize this split and move forward.
  P2: I appreciate the support from both of you. This plan (P1:1, P3:3, P2:5) is critical for me to stay competitive in this race. P1, thank you for agreeing to take 1 this round - your flexibility helps keep this game balanced. P3, I'm glad you're sticking with 3. I confirm I'm absolutely taking 5 and rely on our mutual commitment to avoid collisions. Let's lock this in and move forward with our agreed split.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to ensure we all advance without collision. P3, thanks for sticking with 3, and P2, I support your push for 5 to close the gap. This split keeps the game competitive and fair. I think we’re aligned, so unless there’s a last-minute concern, I’m ready to finalize this plan. Let’s lock it in and keep the momentum going.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I confirm I’m locking in 3 this round. Our split—P1 at 1, me at 3, and P2 at 5—avoids collisions and maintains my lead. I’m good with this arrangement. If there are no more adjustments, let’s finalize and move to the move phase.
  P2: Thank you both for the clear commitments. I confirm I'm taking 5 this round as agreed. This split (P1:1, P3:3, P2:5) is perfect to keep me competitive while ensuring we all advance. I appreciate your cooperation in maintaining a balanced game. Let's lock this in and move forward.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’ve agreed on this split with me at 1, P3 at 3, and P2 at 5. It ensures we all advance and keeps the game competitive. I’m fully committed to this plan and see no need for further changes. If there are no last-minute concerns, let’s lock this in and move to the next phase. I’m ready to end the conversation here.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm feeling aggressive this round given my lead. I’m leaning toward a high, decisive play—so please avoid the highest move if you want to ensure safe progress. P1, a conservative step might be wise, and P2, perhaps a moderate option serves you best. Let’s avoid colliding on the heavy move. Thoughts?
  P2: I see the situation clearly - P3 is dangerously close to winning at 14 steps. P1, we both need to slow P3 down or the game ends quickly. I suggest we both match P3's "high play" by taking 5, creating a collision that prevents their advance. Meanwhile, I'll take 3 to make progress without risking a three-way collision. This strategy gives us both a fighting chance to catch up. What do you think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m aware P3 is close to winning at 14 steps. P2, I see the merit in slowing P3 down with a collision on 5, but I’m hesitant to stall my own progress. P3, I’d prefer to avoid clashing on the highest move. How about I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 sticks with 5? This ensures some of us advance while keeping the game competitive. If we collide, P3 might still pull ahead later. Let’s discuss a split to balance our chances. Thoughts? I’m open to adjust if needed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm locking in 5 this round. To keep our moves distinct and avoid collisions, I'd appreciate P1 sticking with 3 and P2 choosing 1. This split lets us all advance safely while I secure my lead. Can we confirm this approach?
  P2: P3 is about to win! If they take 5 unchallenged, they'll reach 19 and the game ends immediately. I must take 5 to block them, and P1, you should too. A collision on 5 is our only chance to prevent P3's victory. I won't take 1 as suggested - that would guarantee P3 wins! This is a critical moment that requires both of us to block P3's final push. Will you help stop them, P1?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m with P2 on this—P3 is too close to winning at 14 steps. I’m willing to take 5 this round to block P3’s advance, even if it risks my own progress. P3, I can’t let you hit 19 unchallenged. P2, let’s coordinate: if we both pick 5, we stop P3, and you could consider 3 next round to gain ground. This is our best shot to keep the game alive. Can we agree to collide on 5 to prevent P3’s victory? I’m ready to lock this in. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see you’re both set on blocking me, but forcing a collision on high moves only makes the board stall—and that keeps my lead intact. I’m sticking firmly to my aggressive strategy. If you both pick the same heavy move, none of you advance while I maintain my position. If you really want to catch up, you might need to risk a unique play rather than guarantee a tie. What will you decide?
  P2: P3 is right at the finish line! I'm absolutely locked in on 5 to block them from winning this round. P1, we must both choose 5 to prevent P3's victory - it's our only chance. Even if we stall for one round, it gives us time to strategize. P3 reaching 19 ends everything. I'd rather risk temporary stalling than guaranteed defeat. Let's commit to this block together.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with 5 this round to block P3 from reaching 19 and winning. P2, I agree we need to act now—let’s both pick 5 to ensure P3 doesn’t advance. P3, I can’t risk you ending the game this turn. Stalling one round is better than losing outright. If we collide on 5, we buy time to catch up. I’m locked in on this strategy. Final thoughts before we move to the next phase? I’m ready to end the conversation if we’re set.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I see you're both pushing to block me with 5. But if you both lock in 5, none of us will move, and I'll keep my advantage. If one of you deviates, I win this turn. I’m sticking with my plan because my lead is too strong. A collision simply delays your progress while I stay in the lead. Choose wisely—your risk might just secure my victory.
  P2: P1, we must both stay committed to 5 - it's our only chance to stop P3's victory. If P3 gets 5 more steps, they immediately win at 19. Yes, a collision means we all stall this round, but that's far better than certain defeat. P3 is trying to make us doubt our strategy, but don't waver. I'm absolutely locked in on 5 and counting on you to do the same.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m firm on picking 5 this round to block P3 from winning at 19 steps. P2, I’m with you—let’s both stick to 5 to ensure P3 doesn’t advance. P3, a collision may stall us, but it’s our only shot to keep the game alive. I’d rather delay than lose now. I’m locked in on this plan and see no better option. If there’s no further discussion, I’m ready to end the conversation phase. Let’s act decisively to stop the victory.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is at 17 steps - just 2 away from winning! We must block them this round or lose immediately. P3 will likely choose either 3 or 5 to cross the finish line. I suggest we both choose 3 this round - it's the most logical move for P3 as it safely gets them over 19. P1, we must coordinate on this - if we don't both match P3's move, they win instantly. I'm committed to picking 3. Please join me to keep the game alive.
  P3: I appreciate your concern, but my strategy remains unchanged. I’m not switching to block my own progress, and my move stays private. P2, coordinating on 3 may backfire by stalling your own advance, and P1, consider what truly serves you best rather than solely blocking me. I’m committed to securing my lead, so I suggest you both reassess your approach. Let’s see how this round unfolds.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re at a critical point with P3 just 2 steps from winning. P2, I agree we must block P3 this round. I’m leaning toward picking 3 to counter their likely safe move to cross 19. P3, blocking is our only chance to keep the game alive. Let’s coordinate, P2—if we both pick 3, we maximize our odds of stalling P3. I’m ready to lock this in unless there’s a better plan. Thoughts? Let’s act fast to prevent an immediate loss.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm 100% locked in on 3 this round. P1, we must stay united - this is our ONLY chance to prevent P3's victory. P3 is trying to create doubt, but their strategy is transparent. If they get ANY steps this round, they win. Period. A collision on 3 is our best bet to block their most likely move. If we choose different numbers, P3 wins instantly. I'm counting on you to stand firm with me. Together we can keep the game alive.
  P3: I'm locking in 5 this round. Sticking with 3 will only freeze your progress while I win outright. If you switch to 5 to block me, you'll force a collision that stalls everyone—but that's a risk no one should take. I'm not changing my plan. Your call—either you let me win by keeping 3, or you risk stalling and still falling behind.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re at a crucial moment with P3 just 2 steps from victory. P2, I’m with you on blocking P3, and I’m locking in 3 to counter their likely safe move. P3, your switch to 5 might be a bluff, but we can’t risk you winning. P2, let’s stay united on 3 to maximize our chance of stalling P3. If we split, they win. I’m committed to this plan. Final thoughts before we lock in? I’m ready to end the conversation if we’re aligned.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3's declaration about picking 5 isn't a bluff - it's a trap! They want us to stay on 3 while they take 5 and win instantly. P1, we must switch to 5 together! Remember P3's opening message about feeling "aggressive" and making a "high, decisive play" - they telegraphed their 5 move from the start. If we're wrong, we just stall one round. If we're right and block 5, we keep the game alive. I'm switching to 5 and urgently need you to join me.
  P3: I remain locked in on 5 this round. If you both choose 5 to block me, you force a collision that stalls progress while I keep my 17-step lead. Switching to 3 or any other number only helps me reach 19 faster. I'm committed to my aggressive path—it's your call whether you stall yourselves or let me win.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re at a critical juncture with P3 just 2 steps from winning. P2, I’m convinced by your logic—P3’s aggressive stance points to 5. I’m switching to 5 to block them. If we stay on 3 and they take 5, they win instantly. Let’s both lock in 5 to maximize our chance of stalling P3 and keeping the game alive. P3, we can’t let you cross 19 unchallenged. I’m committed to 5 now. Final thoughts? I’m ready to end the conversation if we’re aligned.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm absolutely committed to picking 5 this round to block P3's victory. P1, we must stay united on this - if P3 really picks 5 as they claim, our coordinated block is our only chance to prevent their win. Even if they're bluffing, the worst outcome is we stall one round. If we split our choices, P3 will definitely win. I'm locked in on 5 and counting on you to do the same. Let's keep this game alive.
  P3: I see you both are fixated on 5. While I appreciate your blocking efforts, know that I’m ready to adjust if you lock in that move. A collision might stall your progress—but I won’t let it stop my win. My next step will be swift and decisive. Choose wisely; your commitment might just open the door I need.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with 5 to block P3’s potential win this round. P2, let’s stay united on 5—if P3 picks it, we stop them from hitting 19. P3, your threats won’t sway us; we can’t risk you winning now. A collision is better than defeat. I’m locked in on 5 to keep the game alive. If there’s no further discussion, I’m ready to end the conversation phase. Let’s act decisively.
