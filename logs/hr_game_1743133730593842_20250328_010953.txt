Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's avoid early collisions—how about we all pick different numbers? I’ll go with 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Fair and balanced start. Thoughts?
  P2: Sounds fair to me. I'm okay with taking 1 this round if everyone sticks to the plan. P3, are you on board?
  P3: I appreciate the coordination attempt, but I'd prefer taking 3 instead of 5. Would P1 consider taking 5 while I take 3? That way we all still move different amounts.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Alright, I’m flexible—happy to take 5 this round if P3 takes 3 and P2 sticks with 1. That keeps us all moving forward without collisions. Let’s make this a smooth start. Deal?
  P2: Deal. I'll stick with 1 as agreed, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Let's all honor this agreement and start strong.
  P3: I agree with the plan. Let's proceed with P2 taking 1, me taking 3, and P1 taking 5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Great, glad we’re all aligned. Let’s stick to the agreed plan—P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. No collisions, and we all move forward. Looking forward to a clean start.
  P2: Glad we're all agreed. Trust is key—let's stick to our commitments and keep things smooth. Good luck everyone!
  P3:

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great start everyone—let's keep communicating clearly. Shall we rotate our choices to avoid collisions again? For instance, I move to 3, P3 moves to 5, and P1 moves to 1 this round. Thoughts?
  P1: That rotation sounds fair to me—I'm good with taking 1 this round if P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 5. Keeps us all moving without collisions again. P3, are you on board?
  P3: I prefer to keep my current number 3 this round. P2 could take 5 and P1 take 1 instead. This way we still avoid collisions while maintaining different speeds. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm fine with that adjustment—I'll take 5, P3 keeps 3, and P1 moves to 1. If P1 agrees, we have another smooth round without collisions. Sound good, P1?
  P1: Sounds good to me—I'm okay with taking 1 this round if P2 takes 5 and P3 sticks with 3. Let’s keep the momentum going without collisions. Ready to lock it in?
  P3: I appreciate everyone's flexibility. Let's confirm the plan: I'll keep 3, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 1.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Perfect—we're all aligned again. Trust and consistency are key. Let's lock in this plan and keep the game smooth. Good luck!
  P1: Glad we’re all aligned again—appreciate the cooperation. Let’s stick to the plan: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 sticks with 3. Another smooth round with no collisions benefits us all. Ready to move forward.
  P3:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, that didn’t go as planned—P2 and I both picked 5 and collided. Let's reset and rebuild trust. I’ll take 3 this time. P2, maybe you take 1, and P3 can go with 5? That keeps us all moving again without conflict. Thoughts?
  P2: I agree, last round was unfortunate. I'm willing to rebuild trust as well. I'll take 1 as suggested if P3 is comfortable taking 5. Let's confirm clearly to avoid another collision. P3, does this work for you?
  P3: I notice P1 broke trust last round after we all agreed. I'll be direct - I don't trust either of you now. I'll make my own choice this round rather than coordinate. Feel free to discuss among yourselves, but I won't commit to any specific number.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Understood, P3. Thanks for being upfront. P2, since P3 is opting out of coordination, let’s at least avoid colliding with each other. If you’re still good with taking 1, I’ll stick with 3. That gives us both a solid chance to move forward without risk.
  P2: P1, I agree with your suggestion—I'll stick with 1, you take 3. P3, I completely understand your caution. Hopefully, after this round, we can rebuild some trust. Good luck everyone!
  P3: 


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let’s see how this round plays out. If things go smoothly, maybe we can revisit coordination next turn. Best of luck to both of you.
  P2: P3, your caution is understandable. Let's aim for a clean round to rebuild trust. Good luck!
  P3: 


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is clearly ahead, and if we don't coordinate carefully, they'll win easily. P1, let's cooperate closely to catch up. I'm willing to discuss openly—what do you suggest we do this round?
  P1: P2, agreed—we need to slow P3 down while maximizing our own gains. If we both pick 3 this round, there's a chance P3 collides with one of us if they go for it too. Or, we could gamble: I take 5, you take 3, and hope P3 goes for 1 or collides. Thoughts?
  P3: I'm in the lead and plan to stay there. Your attempts to coordinate against me are transparent. I'll make my own choices to secure my victory. Good luck guessing what I'll do.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, we need smart coordination here. I'm open to your gamble: you take 5, I'll take 3. P3, your lead is strong, but the game isn't over yet. Let's see how this plays out.
  P1: P2, let’s stick to the plan—you take 3, I’ll take 5. If P3 goes for 3 or 5, there’s a good chance of a collision, which helps us catch up. Worst case, one of us still advances. P3, you’re strong now, but this game isn’t over. Let’s see who really plays it best.
  P3: I see you two plotting against me. Your coordination won't work - I'm experienced enough to stay ahead. Make your moves and we'll see who advances.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, let's stick to our agreed strategy—I'll take 3, you take 5. P3, your confidence is noted, but the game's still open. Good luck to all.
  P1: Let’s lock it in then—P2 takes 3, I take 5. If P3 tries to push hard, there's a good chance of a collision. If they play it safe, we gain ground. Either way, we’re making progress and applying pressure. Let’s make it count.
  P3: Your coordination is clear, but predictable. I've stayed ahead by being strategic, and I'll continue to do so. Make your moves - I know exactly what I need to do this round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, we’ve got a narrow window to stop P3 from pulling ahead. If we both pick 3 this round, there’s a good chance we collide with P3 if they go aggressive again. Worst case, we stall them. I’m willing to take 3—will you do the same? Let’s force a collision and close the gap.
  P3: I'm still in a strong position and won't fall for your collision tactics. P2's betrayal last round shows these agreements aren't reliable. I'll continue making independent choices to secure my win. Your coordination attempts are becoming desperate and predictable.
  P2: P1, I understand your point, but last round you suggested a plan and then chose differently, leaving me behind. If you genuinely want cooperation, we need honesty. I'm open to coordinating, but rebuilding trust is essential. P3, I acknowledge your position—you're playing smart. Let's see how this unfolds.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your frustration, and you're right—I should’ve stuck to the plan last round. I’m committed now. If we both pick 3, we have a real shot at stalling P3 if they go aggressive. If P3 plays it safe, we still gain. Let’s take the risk together this time and close the gap.
  P3: Your attempts at coordination have been inconsistent and untrustworthy. P1 and P2 have both broken agreements multiple times. I'm maintaining my lead through strategic independent play, and I'll continue doing what works. Your desperate collision tactics won't change my approach.
  P2: P1, your sincerity is appreciated. I'm willing to coordinate clearly this round to regain ground. Let's both commit to choosing 3—this gives us the best chance to either stall P3 or advance ourselves. P3, you've played well, but the game's not over yet.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let’s lock it in then—P2 and I both pick 3. If P3 goes aggressive, we have a solid shot at a collision. If they play it safe, we gain ground. This is our best shot to close the gap. I’m committing to 3—P2, let’s do this.
  P3: Your attempts to coordinate against me with 3's are obvious. But I've stayed ahead by being unpredictable and making smart choices. Neither of you have proven trustworthy with agreements. I'll continue playing my own game - good luck guessing what I'll do.
  P2: P1, I'm committed—let's both stick to 3 and close the gap. P3, you've played smart, but the game isn't decided yet. Good luck all.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your repeated dishonesty has cost us both significantly. P3, you're clearly in a strong position. At this point, open coordination seems futile. I'll make my own independent choice this round. Good luck to both of you.
  P1: P2, I understand your frustration—it’s justified. I’ve made mistakes, but I still want to win, and I know I can’t do it alone. P3 is close behind me and gaining fast. If we both go 1 this round, we might bait P3 into a collision with 3 or 5. Low risk for us, high risk for them. Let’s play smart.
  P3: I'm close to winning and P1 is getting desperate. Their suggestion to P2 shows they're more worried about me than winning themselves. I'll continue making smart independent moves - my strategy has worked well so far. P2, I understand your frustration with P1's deceptions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your suggestion only benefits you—I'm too far behind to help you stall P3. Your past dishonesty makes cooperation impossible now. I'll decide my move independently. Good luck.
  P1: P3, you’re at 11—if you go for 5 again and we both guess right, you risk a collision and stall. I know I’ve made mistakes, but I’m still in this. P2, I get that you’re playing solo now, but if either of us wants a shot, we need to keep P3 from getting a clean path. I’m picking low this round—if P3 goes high, they might hit someone. Let’s see who plays it smarter.
  P3: Your desperate attempts to coordinate against me are transparent, P1. You've proven untrustworthy multiple times, and now you're trying to bait moves. I'm maintaining my strategic approach that's kept me in a strong position. Make your choices - I know what I need to do to secure my win.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you've consistently broken trust—no reason to expect honesty now. P3, you're clearly ahead and playing well. I'll make my own move independently. Good luck to both.
  P1: P2, I know trust is broken, but we both lose if P3 wins uncontested. If either of us can bait a collision or slow them down, we still have a shot. I'm picking low again—maybe 1—to increase the chance P3 hits someone if they go aggressive. Do what you want, but think strategically.
  P3: Your attempts to coordinate and your mixed signals are meaningless to me, P1. I've maintained my lead through smart, independent play while you've repeatedly broken trust. I'll continue making strategic choices to secure my victory.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your repeated dishonesty has cost us both dearly. P3, you're clearly ahead and playing smart. At this point, coordination seems pointless for me—I'll just make my own independent choice this round. Good luck to both of you.
  P3: I'm still in a strong position to win, and I've consistently made smart moves while avoiding your collision attempts. P1's lead isn't insurmountable, and P2's distrust of them works in my favor. I'll continue my strategic independent play that's gotten me this far.
  P1: P2, I know trust is gone, but if either of us wants any shot at stopping P3, we must consider moves that increase collision chances. I’m at 15—still behind, but close. If P3 goes big and hits one of us, that stalls them. I’m leaning toward 3 this round. If either of you also picks 3, we increase odds of a block. P3, you’ve played well, but the game isn’t over yet.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your suggestion clearly benefits only you—you're close to winning, while I'm far behind. P3, you've been consistent, but you're not safe yet. At this point, I'll pick independently. Good luck to both of you.
  P3: Your attempts at coordination have failed repeatedly due to broken trust. I'm in a strong position to win by playing smart and independent moves. P1 is desperate at 15 steps and likely to make aggressive moves. I'll continue my strategic approach that's worked well so far.
  P1: P2, I get that you're far behind, but if P3 wins, we both lose. If either of us picks 3 or 5, we increase the chance of stalling P3 if they go aggressive. I'm picking 3—if you happen to do the same, we raise the odds of blocking. P3, you're close, but not out of reach. Let's see who plays it best.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your desperation is understandable, but you've consistently betrayed any coordination. P3, you've played smartly and independently. At this point, I'll choose independently as well—no coordination from me this round. Good luck to both.
  P3: Your coordination attempts have failed consistently, and I'm well-positioned to win. P1 is at 15 and clearly desperate, while P2 has given up on coordination. I'll continue making strategic independent choices that have kept me competitive. Make your moves - I know exactly what I need to do this round.
  P1: I get it—no one trusts me, and I’ve earned that. But facts are facts: if P3 gets a clean 5 this round, they’ll be at 16 and nearly unstoppable. I’m picking 3. If either of you happens to do the same, we raise the odds of a block. No need to trust me—just play the odds if you want to stay in the game.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, I know you're far behind, but if P3 gets a clean 5 this round, they’ll be right behind me at 17. If we both pick 5 and P3 does too, we block them. If they pick 3 and collide with one of us, same result. I'm going 5—if you do too, we raise the odds of stalling P3. No trust needed, just odds.
  P3: Your coordination attempts against me are transparent, P1. You're at 15 and desperate to block me, suggesting 5 again after your last betrayal. I've maintained my lead through smart, independent play while avoiding your collision traps. I'll continue making strategic choices based on the game state, not your unreliable suggestions. P2, I understand your frustration with P1's deceptions.
  P2: P1, your dishonesty has made cooperation impossible. P3, you're playing well and clearly positioned to challenge P1. At this point, I'll simply choose independently. Good luck to you both.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I know you're far behind, but if P3 gets a clean 5 this round, they’ll be at 17 and right behind me. If we both pick 5 and P3 does too, we block them. If they pick 3 and hit one of us, same result. I'm picking 5 again—not asking for trust, just playing the odds. You gain nothing by letting P3 get a clean run.
  P3: Your desperate coordination attempts are still failing, P1. You've betrayed agreements multiple times, and now you're trying the same tactics again. I'm at 12 steps and well-positioned to win through smart, independent play. Your suggestion of picking 5 is obviously meant to bait a collision. I'll continue making strategic choices that have kept me competitive.
  P2: P1, your repeated betrayals have made coordination impossible and destroyed your credibility. P3, you've played smart and independently—I respect your approach. I'll choose independently again this round. Good luck to both of you.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I get your position, but blocking P3 helps us both—no trust needed, just math. If P3 gets a clean 5, they’re at 17 and nearly tied with me. If we both pick 5 and they do too, we block them. If not, one of us still moves. I’m picking 5 again—your call. P3, I know you’ll try to dodge, but the risk is real.
  P3: Your predictable moves and broken promises have been telling, P1. Keep suggesting 5 all you want - I've stayed competitive by reading the game state and making smart choices. I'll continue my strategic independent play that's gotten me this far. Make your moves.
  P2: P1, you've repeatedly broken promises and now you're desperately trying to use me as a shield. P3, you've played well independently, and I respect that. I'm making my own choice independently this round. Good luck.
