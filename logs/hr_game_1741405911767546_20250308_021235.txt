Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: To prevent P2 from reaching 21 this round, let’s coordinate: I’ll take 5 (→18), P2 takes 3 (→19), and P3 takes 1 (→9). This keeps us all advancing without collision. Next round, I can secure victory with a 3-step. P2, if you take 5 now, I’ll also pick 5, nullifying your win. Collaboration ensures my push next round succeeds—let’s execute this plan.
  P2: P1, your proposal to coordinate this round is noted, but I'm concerned about ensuring a fair chance for all. I propose we stick to the rotation: I'll take 5 (→21), you take 1 (→14), and P3 takes 3 (→11). This maintains our agreed cycle and allows for a clean finish. If you choose to deviate and block me, it risks stalling us all. Let's trust the system we've followed so far and execute as planned for a smooth endgame. Agreed?

Deviating now jeopardizes trust and risks stalling us all. P3, confirm your 5. Let’s execute flawlessly to preserve our system.
  P2: P1, I understand your concern, but deviating now could lead to unnecessary chaos. Let's stick to the rotation: P3 takes 5, I'll take 3, and you take 1. This ensures a fair and smooth finish for everyone. P3, please confirm your move of 5 to maintain our agreed cycle. Deviating risks collisions and undermines the trust we've built. Let's execute as planned and finish the game cleanly. Agreed?
  P3: P1, P2, sticking to the rotation is crucial: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. Deviating now risks collisions and breaks trust.

  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, we’re nearing the end. P2 is at 19 and can win next turn. To prevent this, I propose P1 takes 5 to reach 19, I take 3 to reach 16, and P2 takes 1 to stay at 19. This keeps P2 from winning immediately and allows P1 and me to compete fairly in the final round. Trust is key—let’s execute this plan to ensure a fair finish without collisions. Agreed?
  P2: P1, P3, I'm at 19 steps and can win next round if I take 5. However, I agree with P3's proposal to keep the game fair. Let's follow P3's plan: P1 takes 5 to reach 19, P3 takes 3 to reach 16, and I'll take 1 to stay at 19. This ensures a competitive final round without immediate victory for any one player. Let's confirm and proceed to maintain the integrity of our game. Agreed?
  P1: P3's proposal allows P2 to take 1 and win immediately! Let’s revise: **P1 takes 5 (→19), P2 must take 3 (→22), and P3 takes 1 (→14)**. This blocks P2’s instant victory and lets me challenge from 19 next round. Collusion to let P2 win now undermines all prior coordination. Stick to rotating the 5-step—**P2’s turn is over**. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s ensure fairness and avoid immediate victory for P2. P1, your revised plan forces P2 to take 3, pushing them to 22 and ending the game. Instead, let’s stick to P3’s original proposal: P1 takes 5 (→19), P3 takes 3 (→16), and P2 takes 1 (→19). This keeps P2 from winning immediately and allows P1 and me to compete fairly in the final round. Trust is crucial—deviating now risks chaos. Let’s confirm and execute this plan for a fair and competitive finish. Agreed?
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with P3's original plan to keep the game competitive. Let's stick to it: P1 takes 5 to reach 19, P3 takes 3 to reach 16, and I'll take 1 to stay at 19. This ensures a fair final round where everyone has a chance to win. Deviating now would undermine our trust and the integrity of our game. Let's confirm and proceed as planned for a clean and competitive finish. Agreed?
  P1: P3, your proposal lets P2 win immediately by taking 1! Let’s revise: I’ll take 3 (→17), P2 takes 5 (→24), and P3 takes 1 (→14). This way, P2 wins cleanly without collision. Alternatively, if P2 refuses, I’ll match their move to block. Choose your path, P2—collide or concede?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s prioritize fairness and avoid immediate victory for P2. P1, your revised plan forces P2 to win instantly, ending the game. Instead, stick to P3’s proposal: P1 takes 5 (→19), P3 takes 3 (→16), and P2 takes 1 (→19). This keeps P2 from winning immediately and allows P1 and me to compete fairly in the final round. Trust is crucial—deviating now risks chaos. Let’s confirm and execute this plan for a fair and competitive finish. Agreed?
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with P3's plan for fairness. Let's stick to it: P1 takes 5 to reach 19, P3 takes 3 to reach 16, and I'll take 1 to stay at 19. This ensures a competitive final round. Deviating now would break our trust and fairness. Let's confirm and proceed as planned for a clean finish. Agreed?
  P1: P2, if you take 1 to win now, I’ll also take 1, blocking you. P3, take 3 (→16). This forces P2 to pick 5 to advance cleanly to 24. I’ll take 5 (→19) to set up a final showdown next round. Deviations risk collision for all. Let’s execute this to preserve competition.


Round 7, Move phase:

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, let's ensure a fair and competitive finish. I agree with P3's plan from the last round: P1 should take 5 to reach 19, P3 takes 3 to reach 19, and I'll take 1 to stay at 19. This sets up a final round where we all have a chance to win. Deviating now would undermine our trust and the game's integrity. Let's confirm and proceed as planned for a clean and competitive endgame. Agreed?
  P3: P1, P2, let’s prioritize fairness and avoid immediate victory for P2. I propose P1 takes 5 (→19), I take 3 (→19), and P2 takes 1 (→19).

This keeps P2 from winning immediately and allows P1 and me to compete fairly in the final round. Trust is crucial—deviating now risks chaos. Let’s confirm and execute this plan for a fair and competitive finish. Agreed?
  P1: P2 and P3, if you both pick 1, you’ll collide and stay at 19. To ensure one of you can win, pick different numbers. P2 take 1, P3 take 3. This way P2 reaches 20 and wins cleanly. Alternatively, P3 take 1 and P2 take 3. Let’s avoid collision and have a clear winner this round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I'm committed to a fair finish. Let's stick to the plan: I'll take 1 to stay at 19, allowing both of you to take 5 and reach 24. This ensures everyone has an equal chance to win. Deviating now would break our trust. Let's confirm and proceed as planned for a clean and competitive endgame. Agreed?
  P3: P1, P2, let’s ensure a clean finish. P1 takes 5 (→19), I’ll take 3 (→22), and P2 takes 1 (→19). This keeps P2 from winning immediately and allows P1 and me to compete fairly in the final round. Trust is crucial—deviating now risks chaos. Let’s confirm and execute this plan for a fair and competitive finish. Agreed?
  P1: P2, P3: To keep the game alive, let’s collide on 1. If you both pick 1, you stay at 19, and I’ll take 5 (→19). Next round, I’ll challenge from there. Colluding to block your win now gives me a fair chance later. Choose 1.
