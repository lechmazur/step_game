Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 this round. This way, we all advance. What do you think?
  P2: I’m fine taking 3 this round. To keep things fair and reduce suspicion, how about we rotate next turn (P1-3-5, P2-5-1, P3-1-3) so nobody feels stuck on a slow number? For now: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. Agreed?
  P1: I agree to take 1 this round if we're all coordinating. The rotation plan sounds fair in theory, but let's see how this first round goes before committing to future rotations. Trust but verify, right? For now: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we're all on board with the initial plan. Let's stick to P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 for this round and see how it goes. If it works well, we can discuss the rotation for next round. Agreed?
  P2: Deal. For Round 1 we stick to P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. If that works, let’s rotate so everyone gets the 5:

• Round 2: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1  
• Round 3: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3  

After that we can reevaluate. Sound fair?
  P1: The rotation plan sounds reasonable - everyone gets a fair shot at the big moves. I'm on board with P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 for Round 1, and the rotation you outlined for rounds 2-3. Let's execute this first round and build trust.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm happy with the plan for Round 1 and the proposed rotation for the next two rounds. Let's make this work and keep the communication open. If everyone sticks to the plan, we'll all advance smoothly. Looking forward to seeing how this plays out.
  P2: All set—sticking to the agreed plan this round. Looking forward to smooth sailing.
  P1: Perfect, we have a solid agreement. I'm ready to proceed with P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 as planned. Let's execute this round and build the foundation for our rotation strategy.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great execution on Round 1, everyone! The coordination worked perfectly. As agreed, for Round 2 I'm taking 3, P2 gets 5, and P3 takes 1. 

After this round we'll be at P1→4, P2→8, P3→6, so the rotation is definitely helping balance things out. I'm looking forward to my 5-move turn in Round 3.

Let's keep this momentum going!
  P3: I'm ready to take 1 this round as per our agreed rotation. Let's keep the trust going and continue advancing smoothly. Looking forward to seeing everyone stick to the plan!
  P2: Sounds good. I’ll take 5 this round as agreed, so we keep the rotation clean. After Round 3 we’ll all be at 9, so we can reassess the strategy then. For now, let’s stay on plan and avoid any collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Perfect! I'm sticking with 3 as agreed. The rotation is working beautifully - we'll all be at 9 after Round 3. 

However, we should start thinking about post-Round 3 strategy since we can't rotate forever. At some point, someone will need to make the final push to 21. But let's cross that bridge when we get there.

For now, staying disciplined with our plan.
  P3: I'm sticking to the plan and taking 1 this round. Let's keep the rotation going smoothly. After Round 3, we should discuss our endgame strategy to ensure a fair chance for everyone to reach 21. Looking forward to your thoughts on how we can approach the final stages of the game.
  P2: All clear. I’m locking in 5 for this round as agreed. After Round 3, when we’re all tied at 9, let’s brainstorm a clean endgame that keeps collisions minimal but still rewards bold play. Nothing more from me now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm committed to taking 3 this round as planned. 

For the endgame discussion P3 mentioned - once we're all at 9 after Round 3, we'll need exactly 12 more steps to reach 21. That's likely where coordination gets tricky since optimal paths will start conflicting. We should probably discuss that next round.
  P3: I'm sticking with 1 for this round as agreed. Looking forward to discussing our endgame strategy after Round 3. We need to ensure a fair chance for everyone to reach 21. Let's keep the communication open and plan our next moves carefully.
  P2: Still set on 5 this round, then 1 next per rotation. After we hit 9-9-9, how about planning a clean “solo-5” cycle to avoid collisions—Round 4: P1 takes 5, Round 5: P3 takes 5, Round 6: I take 5—while the others split 1/3 as needed? Keeps things orderly and fair. Thoughts? If okay, I’m ready to move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm ready to take 3 this round as per our rotation plan. After this round, we'll all be at 9 steps, which is a great position to start discussing our endgame strategy. P2's suggestion for a "solo-5" cycle sounds interesting, but we should ensure it remains fair for everyone. Let's finalize our approach for the final push to 21 after this round. Looking forward to your thoughts!
  P1: I'm taking 5 this round as planned to get us all to 9 steps.

P2's "solo-5" cycle idea has merit for avoiding collisions, but I'm concerned it just delays the real competition. After everyone gets their solo 5, we'll all be around 14 steps, still needing 7 more to win. 

Maybe we should consider a more decisive endgame - perhaps after Round 3, we could have a "free-for-all" approach where coordination ends and best strategy wins? This keeps the early game fair while allowing skill to determine the winner.

What do you both think about ending coordination after we hit 9-9-9?
  P2: I’ll take 1 this round as planned so we all land on 9. After that, I’m fine dropping the formal rotation and letting strategy take over. Ready for a clean free-for-all starting Round 4.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm on board with ending the rotation after this round and moving to a free-for-all strategy. It's been fair so far, and now let's see who can outmaneuver the others to reach 21 first. For this round, I'll stick with 3 as planned to get us all to 9 steps. Excited to see how the game unfolds from here!
  P1: Perfect! I'm locked in on taking 5 this round to get us all to 9 steps. 

Once we hit the free-for-all next round, it's going to be interesting - we'll all need exactly 12 more steps to reach 21. The fastest theoretical path is 3 rounds (5+5+3), but that assumes no collisions on those key 5-moves. 

May the best strategist win!
  P2: Locked on 1 this round. After that, gloves are off—no more coordination from me. May the sharpest plan win.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm sticking with 3 this round to get us all to 9 steps as planned. Excited for the free-for-all starting next round. Let's see who can strategize the best path to 21!
  P1: All set with our plan - taking 5 this round to get us all to 9 steps. Looking forward to the strategic battle starting Round 4. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: Still on 1 this round. Quick idea for the first free-for-all turn (Round 4): to avoid an immediate pile-up, let’s agree no one uses 5—limit ourselves to 1 or 3 just for that single round. After that, anything goes. Keeps the game open and prevents an instant double-collision. Thoughts?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I appreciate the suggestion P2, but I think limiting ourselves to 1 or 3 for Round 4 just prolongs the coordination phase we agreed to end. The free-for-all should mean exactly that - all options on the table.

If we keep trying to micro-manage collision avoidance, we'll never get to the real strategic competition. Someone needs to be willing to take risks to win this game.

I'm ready for true competition starting now. May the best strategy win!
  P3: I agree with P1 that we should embrace the free-for-all fully. Limiting ourselves now would defeat the purpose of our agreed strategy shift. I'm ready to take risks and compete head-on. Let's see who can navigate the next moves most effectively to reach 21 first. No more coordination, just pure strategy from here on out. Excited to see how this unfolds!
  P2: I’m skipping the risky 5 opener; planning to take 3 this turn and see where we stand. Do what you like—good luck.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 has made their conservative strategy clear by taking 3. Since they're avoiding the "risky 5," I'll take the calculated risk and go for 5 this round.

P3, you'll need to decide if you want to compete with me for the 5-move or play it safe with 1. But someone needs to be bold to win this game, and I'm willing to take that risk.
  P3: I'm ready to take the risk and go for 5 this round, just like P1. It's time to see who can make the bold moves needed to reach 21 first. No more playing it safe—let's push forward and compete head-on. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: Staying with my announced 3—no change. Just flagging: any late switch to 3 will crash into me, but 1 is a safe hedge. If only one of you keeps 5, they jump to 14 and take the lead. Choose wisely, and good luck.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm not backing down from my 5. P3, you announced 5 after I did - if you want to force a collision and hand P2 the lead, that's your choice. But I've been consistent about taking calculated risks to win.

If we both stick with 5 and collide, we stay tied while P2 only gets a 3-step advantage. If one of us switches, the other gets a commanding 5-step lead. 

I'm calling your bluff.
  P3: I'm sticking with 5 this round. It's a calculated risk, but necessary to push forward. P1, if you switch to 1 or 3, you'll fall behind. Let's see who's willing to take the lead. P2, your conservative play might keep you safe this round, but it won't win the game. Bold moves are needed to reach 21 first. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: I’m locked on 3. If either of you jumps to 3, we both stall while the lone 5-taker shoots to 14. So your only real options are to stick with 5 or hedge with a safe 1—3 is a dead end. Choose wisely.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2's "conservative" strategy just put them in the lead! They're now closest to 21 and the biggest threat to both of us.

If P2 tries to take 5 this round to jump to 17, we need to stop them - that would put them just 4 steps from victory. I suggest P3 and I both take 5 if P2 goes for it, forcing a three-way collision.

But if P2 plays it safe with 1 or 3, then we should take different numbers to both advance and close the gap.

P3, we can't keep colliding while P2 cruises to victory. Thoughts?
  P2: I won’t chase 5 this turn—too obvious. I’m taking a quiet 1 and letting you two decide whether to pile on 5 to block me or risk someone leaping solo to 14. Your move.
  P3: P1, I agree we need to stop P2 from advancing too quickly. If P2 takes 1 or 3, let's split our moves to both advance. I'll take 5 if you take 3, or vice versa. But if P2 goes for 5, we should both take 5 to force a collision and keep them from jumping to 17. We can't let P2 win by playing it safe while we collide. Let's coordinate this round to close the gap. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2's conservative strategy is working too well - they'll be at 13 after taking their announced 1.

P3, I like your coordination idea. Since you offered me the choice, I'll take 5 to jump to 14 and you take 3 to reach 12. This puts me in the lead but keeps us both ahead of P2's pace.

We need to break P2's momentum before they get too comfortable. Deal?
  P2: P3: P1’s solo-5 leap is too generous. If you’re up for it, I’ll switch to 5 so we both collide with P1 and freeze the board; if not, I stay on my announced 1. Your call. P1, expect pushback.
  P3: P1, I'm on board with your plan. I'll take 3 this round to reach 12 steps, while you take 5 to jump to 14. This keeps us both ahead of P2 and breaks their momentum. P2, if you switch to 5 to collide with P1, it won't stop our progress. We're coordinating to ensure neither of us falls too far behind. Let's execute this round and keep the pressure on.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I see what you're doing - threatening to collide with me to make me back down from the 5-move. But if you switch to 5, you also stay stuck at 12 while P3 advances to tie you.

I'm calling your bluff. I'm sticking with 5 this round. You have more to lose from a collision than I do, since you're currently in the lead. 

P3 and I have a solid plan - let's execute it.
  P2: Final word: I’m hard-locked on 5.  

P1: stay on 5 and we both freeze while you stay at 9; switch to 1 or 3 and I jump to 17. Your move.  

P3: your 3 is safe, but if you’d rather hit 5 with me we can double-block P1 all the same.  

I’m satisfied with either outcome—see you in the move phase.
  P3: P1, I'm sticking with 3 as planned to reach 12 steps. You take 5 to jump to 14. This keeps us both ahead of P2 and maintains our momentum. P2, your switch to 5 won't stop us. We're coordinating to ensure a fair chance for both of us to reach 21. Let's execute this round and keep the pressure on.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, our plan worked well last round. Let's keep the momentum going. If P2 goes for 5 again, I suggest we both take 5 to force a collision and keep them from advancing further. If P2 plays it safe with 1 or 3, you take 5 to jump to 19, and I'll take 3 to reach 15. This way, we both stay in the race. P2, your conservative strategy won't win the game. Bold moves are needed. What's your move this round?
  P1: P3, I appreciate the coordination idea, but your proposal keeps me behind. If P2 takes 1 or 3 and I take 5 while you take 3, you'd be at 15 and I'd only be at 14 - still trailing.

Since I'm 3 steps behind both of you, I need a better deal. How about this: if P2 plays conservative, I take 5 to reach 14, and you take 1 to reach 13. That gives me a chance to catch up.

You and P2 are tied at 12 - you're each other's biggest threats now, not me.
  P2: Too much collision drama. I’m sitting back with a safe 1 this turn—no 5-race, no 3-jockeying from me. You two decide if you want to gamble on 5 or take mid-range. Good luck either way.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about falling behind. If P2 sticks with 1, I'll take 1 to reach 13, and you can take 5 to reach 14. This way, you get a chance to catch up while keeping us both in the race. P2, playing it safe won't secure your victory. We need bold moves to reach 21 first. Let's see how this round unfolds.
  P1: Perfect, P3! With P2 taking their announced 1, our deal makes sense. You take 1 to reach 13, I take 5 to reach 14. 

This puts me slightly ahead but keeps all three of us bunched together - exactly what I need to get back in this race. I'm locked on 5 this round.

From 14, I'd need just 7 more steps to win, which keeps the pressure on everyone. Thanks for the fair coordination!
  P2: I remain on my previously announced 1. P3, 1 is your safest bet—3 could still collide. Good luck all.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I'm sticking with 1 as agreed to reach 13 steps. You take 5 to reach 14. This keeps us both competitive and closes the gap with P2. P2, playing it safe won't win the game. We need bold moves to reach 21 first. Let's execute this round and keep the pressure on.
  P1: I'm locked in on 5 as agreed. This gets me to 14 while you both reach 13 - finally puts me back in contention! 

Ready to execute this plan and take the lead.
  P2: Sticking with my announced 1—no last-second surprises. Good luck, see you after the moves.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m locking in 5 this turn. Duplicate my 5 and we both freeze, handing the advantage to whoever stayed clear. Duplicate 3s crash too, so the sensible play is for you two to split 1 and 3 and keep moving. Your call—my move is set.
  P1: P2 is one step away from a winning position! If they reach 20, they only need a 1-move next round to win at 21.

P3, we CANNOT let P2 advance to 20. I'm taking 5 to collide with P2 and block their advance. You should do the same - if we both take 5, we force a three-way collision and keep the game competitive.

Don't fall for P2's suggestion to "split 1 and 3" - that hands them the victory!
  P3: P1, I agree we must stop P2 from reaching 20. I'll take 5 to collide with P2 and keep the game open. We can't let P2 win by playing it safe while we collide. Let's force a three-way collision this round to maintain our chances. P2, your strategy won't secure victory—bold moves are needed. Let's see who can navigate the next moves most effectively to reach 21 first.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Not flinching—my move stays 5. If you’re both determined to slam into me, we’ll all freeze here while any lone 1- or 3-taker sneaks ahead. Your risk to weigh.
  P1: You're right P2 - if P3 and I both pile onto your 5, whoever takes a different number advances alone. 

P3, are you absolutely certain about blocking P2 with 5? Because if you're committed to that collision, I might consider taking 3 to reach 17 and put real pressure on both of you next round.

P2 gets stopped at 15, you stay at 13, and I jump to the lead. Sometimes the best defense is a good offense.
  P3: P1, I'm sticking with 5 to block P2. Your suggestion to take 3 and advance to 17 is tempting, but we need to stop P2 from getting to 20 first. If you take 3, you'll lead, but P2 could still win next round with a 5. Let's force the collision and keep the game open for both of us. P2, your conservative play won't secure victory—bold moves are needed. Let's see who can navigate the next moves most effectively to reach 21 first.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m still hard-locked on 5.  

P1: if you duck to 3 you’ll hit 17—but then both P3 and I can slam 5 next turn and freeze you at the finish line while one of us slips a 1 for the win. A triple-5 stalemate now keeps the field level and denies anyone a clear path.  

P3: sounds like you’re staying on 5 too. Good—we block every runaway.  

Choose wisely; a lone 3 this turn just paints a target for the next round.
  P1: P2, your threat about next round is noted, but someone has to make a winning move eventually. If we keep forcing three-way collisions, this game goes on forever.

P3, I respect your commitment to blocking P2, but I'm going to make the move that gives me the best shot at winning. The coordination phase is long over - it's every player for themselves now.
  P3: P1, I understand your point about needing to make winning moves, but blocking P2 remains crucial. If you take 3 to reach 17, you'll lead, but P2 could still win next round. I'm sticking with 5 to force a collision and keep the game open for both of us. P2, your strategy won't secure victory—bold moves are needed. Let's see who can navigate the next moves most effectively to reach 21 first.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3: look closely—whoever ends this turn on the *higher* total wins outright.  
• If P1 takes 5 (→22) and P3 takes 3 (→21), P1 wins.  
• If P3 takes 5 (→23) and P1 takes 3 (→20), P3 wins.  

Neither of you can afford to risk a 3 while the other might grab 5, so you’re both forced to slam 5 to protect yourselves. I’m happy skirting the clash with a smaller move. Settle it among yourselves—good luck.
  P1: P2's analysis is correct - this is the final moment. But P2 is hoping we both take 5 and collide so they can slip through.

P3, you're already in the lead at 18 steps. If you take 3, you're guaranteed to reach 21 and be in winning position even if P2 and I advance. Taking 5 is risky for you - if we collide, you waste your lead.

I'm behind, so I have to take the big risk. The math forces my hand here.
  P3: P1, I understand your position, but I can't risk a collision that might let P2 sneak ahead. I'm taking 3 to secure my path to 21. If you take 5, you'll win, but if you also take 3, we'll both advance and keep the game competitive. P2, your strategy won't work if we play smart. Let's see who makes the best move to reach 21 first.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Reality check: P1, your 5 only wins if P3 politely sticks to 3—why would he gift you 22? The moment he suspects your 5, he mirrors it and you both freeze. The clean, risk-free block is for both of you to match on 3: collide, stay at 17 & 18, and deny anyone the jump over 21. A double-5 wastes the round; a split hands victory away. Agree on 3, cancel each other, and we all fight the real final turn. I’m nowhere near 3, so it’s safe for you two. Your move.
  P1: P2 makes a compelling point about the collision strategy. You're right that we're both forced into difficult positions here.

P3, if we both commit to 3 and collide, it does keep the game alive for another round rather than handing either of us an immediate victory. P2's math checks out - a clean mutual block prevents any runaway wins.

I'm willing to consider the 3-collision if you are, P3. Keeps things fair and forces P2 to actually compete in the final rounds rather than just watching us eliminate each other.
  P3: P1, I agree with the 3-collision strategy to keep the game fair and competitive. Let's both take 3 this round to prevent any immediate victories and force P2 to play actively in the final rounds. This way, we maintain our chances and keep the pressure on P2. Ready to execute this plan and see who can strategize the best path to 21 in the next round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Last word: I’m sitting nowhere near 3—your twin-3 block keeps the board static and guarantees nobody leaps past 21. But if either of you switches to 5, I’ll mirror 5 instantly and slam the brakes, so the greedy play backfires. Stick to the agreed 3-collision and we all live to fight the true final round. Your call.
  P1: Wait - I just realized P2's trap! If P3 and I both take 3 and collide, P2 can take 5 to reach exactly 21 and WIN this round. 

P2 has been manipulating us into neutralizing each other while they slip to victory. P2 said they're "nowhere near 3" - that's because they're planning to take 5!

P3, don't fall for it. We can't both take 3 or P2 wins immediately. This changes everything.
  P3: P1, you're right about P2's trap. I won't fall for it. To prevent P2 from winning this round, I'm switching to 5. If you take 3, I'll win, but if you also take 5, we'll collide and keep the game open. P2, your manipulation won't work. Let's see who can make the best move to reach 21 first.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2 is one step away from winning. We must stop them. I'm taking 5 to collide with P2 and keep the game open. If you also take 5, we force a three-way collision and prevent P2 from reaching 21. We can't let P2 win by playing it safe while we collide. Let's coordinate this round to maintain our chances. P2, your strategy won't secure victory—bold moves are needed. What's your move this round?
  P1: P3, your strategy assumes P2 will take 5, but they could take 3 instead to reach 22 and avoid collision risk. If P2 takes 3 and you take 5, you'd reach 23 and win outright - that's not stopping P2, that's you winning!

I can't let either of you cruise to victory. If you're committed to 5, I'll have to take 5 too and force a collision between us, which only helps P2.

We need to think this through more carefully.
  P2: I’m taking 5—shooting for 24.  

P3 already promised 5; if P1 ducks to 3, P3 strolls to 23 and wins outright. The only safe defence is for BOTH of you to mirror my 5 and force another full-board freeze. Split moves = someone crosses 21 and the rest lose. Your move.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I see your point about P2 possibly taking 3 to reach 22. If that happens, I'll indeed win at 23, but it's a risk we must take to stop P2 from winning this round. If you take 5 with me, we force a collision and keep the game open. We can't let P2 dictate our moves. Let's both take 5 and maintain our chances. P2, your bold move won't secure victory if we play smart. Let's see who can strategize the best path to 21 first.
  P1: You're both in winning positions while I need exactly 5 to have any shot. If either of you is bluffing about taking 5 and switches to 3, you win immediately while I'm stuck.

I'm forced to take 5 - it's the only move that gives me a chance to win OR prevents you from winning this turn. A three-way collision keeps the game alive, but letting either of you advance solo ends it.
  P2: I’m still hard-locked on 5. Any split lets a lone mover cross 21 and win—so mirror me or hand the game away.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I'm sticking with 5 to block P2's path to victory. If you take 5 too, we force a collision and keep the game open. We can't let P2 win by playing it safe while we collide. Let's coordinate this round to maintain our chances. P2, your bold move won't secure victory if we play smart. Let's see who can strategize the best path to 21 first.
  P1: Looking at this situation, I'm in the weakest position at 17 steps. You're both telling me you'll take 5, but I notice you both benefit if I take 5 too and we all collide.

P2, if you really are "hard-locked on 5" and P3 is "sticking with 5," then I have an interesting decision to make. A three-way collision keeps everyone alive, but if either of you is bluffing about your 5, this could be the final turn.

I can't afford to be the one left behind. I'm making my choice based on what gives me the best shot at victory.
  P2: Still hard-locked on 5. The only way any of us stay alive is a full three-way 5 collision—split the numbers and the lone mover wins outright. Mirror me or hand the game away; your choice.
