Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Hi P2 and P3, to avoid collisions and ensure progress, I suggest we coordinate: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1 this turn. That way, everyone advances, and we can rotate next time. What do you think? "
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m on board with P1’s plan for this turn. Taking 1 step works for me, and rotating next time sounds fair to ensure we all progress without collisions. Let’s stick to this coordination—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. Looking forward to hearing P2’s thoughts.
  P2: I'm okay with the proposed coordination for this turn. To confirm, I'll take 3 steps as suggested. Let's proceed with P1 taking 5, me taking 3, and P3 taking 1. If we stick to this plan, we should discuss the rotation for the next turn. I'm open to adjusting the rotation for subsequent turns to maintain a fair and collision-free progression. Shall we confirm our moves according to the suggested plan?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, thanks for sticking to the plan last turn. As discussed, let’s rotate this time to keep things fair. I suggest P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 5 to catch up a bit. This way, we all continue to progress without collisions. What do you both think about this rotation for Round 2? I’m open to adjustments if needed.
  P1: Okay P3, I agree with your rotation suggestion for fairness this turn: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and you take 5. That keeps us progressing without collisions. P2, are you on board with this plan? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P2: I'm on board with the proposed rotation for Round 2. To confirm, I'll take 1 step as suggested. Let's finalize the plan: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. For the next round, we should discuss a strategy to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. Perhaps we can start thinking about a pattern or a way to signal our moves in advance. I'm open to suggestions on how to proceed after this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, thanks for agreeing to the rotation this turn. I’m glad we’re keeping things fair with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and me taking 5. For the next round, maybe we can continue rotating so no one falls too far behind or surges ahead too quickly. How about we discuss a pattern like P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3 next time? Let me know your thoughts. I’m open to other ideas to ensure we all keep progressing smoothly.
  P1: P3, I'm fine with your Round 3 suggestion: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and you take 3. It keeps things balanced and avoids collisions. P2, are you on board? Let's confirm this plan for efficiency.
  P2: I'm on board with the plan for Round 2. For Round 3, P3's suggestion of P1 taking 1, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 3 seems reasonable. To plan ahead, we should think about a rotation pattern that continues beyond Round 3. Perhaps we can cycle through the moves in a way that ensures everyone gets a chance to take each step size. Let's discuss this further to avoid collisions in future rounds.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To ensure we maintain a fair and collision-free progression, let's confirm our plan for Round 3 as previously discussed. P1 will take 1 step, I (P2) will take 5 steps, and P3 will take 3 steps. For Round 4, we should continue rotating. How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5? This maintains the cycle and keeps us balanced. Let's confirm our moves for Round 3 and discuss further if needed. I'm ready to proceed with the plan unless there are any objections or alternative suggestions.
  P1: I agree with your Round 3 plan, P2: I'll take 1 step, you take 5, and P3 takes 3 to keep things balanced. For Round 4, your rotation suggestion—me taking 3, you taking 1, P3 taking 5—seems fair. P3, what do you think? Let's confirm and move forward smoothly.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m good with the Round 3 plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 3. It keeps us balanced and collision-free. For Round 4, I also agree with P2’s suggestion of P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and me taking 5. Let’s stick to this rotation to ensure fairness. If there are no objections, I’m ready to proceed with this plan. Looking forward to confirming with you both.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To confirm, for Round 3, I'll take 5 steps as planned. Let's proceed with the agreed-upon moves. For future rounds, we should consider a more dynamic strategy to avoid predictability. Perhaps we can introduce a random element or a signal to adjust our rotation. I'm open to suggestions. Let's focus on Round 3 first and then discuss further adjustments. If you're both ready, we can stop discussing and move to the next phase.
  P1: Agreed, I'll take 1 step for Round 3 as planned to keep us balanced. P2's idea for a more dynamic strategy in future rounds could help avoid predictability and maintain fairness—perhaps we can discuss signals or rotations later. P3, are you set? If so, I'm ready to proceed.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m all set for Round 3 with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 5, and me taking 3. I appreciate P2’s idea of adding a dynamic strategy later to keep things unpredictable, and I’m open to discussing signals or new patterns after this round. For now, let’s stick to the plan and ensure we all progress. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to move forward.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Agreed, for Round 4 I'll take 3 as planned to keep things balanced. P2, your dynamic strategy idea is interesting—perhaps we can discuss adding randomness or signals after this round to avoid predictability. P3, are you set with the plan? Let's confirm and proceed efficiently.
  P2: To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, I'll reiterate that I'll take 1 step as per our plan for Round 4. For future rounds, I suggest we introduce a subtle signal to adjust our rotation. Perhaps we can use the last digit of the sum of our current steps to decide the next move distribution. This adds a layer of unpredictability while still being fair. P1 and P3, what are your thoughts on incorporating such a signal? Let's discuss and refine our strategy.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m set for Round 4 with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and me taking 5 as planned. I like P2’s idea of using a signal like the last digit of our step sum to add unpredictability. It could keep things fair yet dynamic. Maybe we test it after this round? Let’s confirm our moves for now and discuss the signal details later. I’m ready to proceed if you both are.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed, I'll take 3 for Round 4 to keep things balanced. P2's signal idea is smart for adding unpredictability—let's discuss specifics after this round, like using the sum's last digit to dictate moves. It could prevent anyone from surging ahead too fast. P3, are you set? If so, I'm ready to proceed or stop if everyone is.
  P2: To add a layer of unpredictability for future rounds, I suggest we use the last digit of the sum of our current steps to decide the next move distribution. Our current total steps are P1: 9, P2: 9, P3: 9, summing to 27. The last digit is 7. We can map this digit to a specific rotation. For example, using the remainder when divided by 3 (7 % 3 = 1), we can shift our rotation accordingly. Let's discuss how to map this to our next moves. I'm open to your thoughts on this approach.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m on board with testing P2’s signal idea using the last digit of our step sum for future rounds. For Round 4, let’s stick to our plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. After this, we can finalize how to map digits to rotations—maybe 0-3 means P1 gets 5, P2 gets 3, P3 gets 1, and so on. Let’s confirm Round 4 moves and refine this idea next turn. I’m ready to proceed if you are.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed, I'll take 3 for Round 4 to keep things balanced. P2's signal idea is solid for adding unpredictability, but let's make sure the mapping is fair—maybe cycle the assignments based on the remainder. P3, are you set? If so, I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: To proceed with Round 4, I'll take 1 step as planned. For Round 5, let's finalize the signal idea. Since our total steps sum to 27, the last digit is 7. Using 7 % 3 = 1, we can shift our rotation. I propose that the remainder corresponds to the player who takes the highest step (5). So, for remainder 1 (P2), I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. Let's discuss and confirm this mapping for Round 5. If you're both on board, we can proceed with this strategy.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m sticking to our Round 4 plan with me taking 5. Regarding P2’s signal idea for Round 5, using the remainder of the step sum (7 % 3 = 1) to assign moves is interesting. I’m okay with P2 taking 5, me taking 3, and P1 taking 1 if that’s the mapping. Let’s ensure the rotation cycles fairly over time. If we’re all set for Round 4, I’m ready to proceed. Thoughts on finalizing the signal mapping?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Agreed, I'll take 3 for Round 4 to keep things balanced. P2's signal idea with the remainder assigning the 5-step move is a good way to add unpredictability and fairness—I'm on board. P3, are you set with this? If so, let's proceed.
  P2: To confirm for Round 4, I'll take 1 step as planned. For Round 5, let's finalize the signal idea. Since our total steps sum to 27, the last digit is 7. Using 7 % 3 = 1, I propose that I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This mapping seems fair. Let's confirm this for Round 5. If you're both on board with this strategy, I'm ready to proceed.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m confirmed for Round 4 with me taking 5 as planned. For Round 5, I’m fine with P2’s mapping using the remainder (7 % 3 = 1), so P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. Let’s ensure this system rotates fairly over time to avoid any bias. If we’re all set for Round 4, I’m ready to move forward.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Agreed on Round 5 plan: I'll take 1 step as per our signal agreement. With current sum at 36 (remainder 0), let's define mappings for all remainders to keep it fair—e.g., remainder 0: P3 takes 5, 1: P2 takes 5, 2: P1 takes 5. Thoughts on refining this? P2 and P3, are you on board?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m good with the Round 5 plan based on our signal: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. I also like P1’s suggestion for mapping remainders to keep it fair—remainder 0: P3 takes 5, 1: P2 takes 5, 2: P1 takes 5. This ensures rotation over time. Let’s confirm this mapping for future rounds to maintain balance and unpredictability. If we’re all set for Round 5, I’m ready to proceed. Thoughts on finalizing this system?
  P2: To confirm for Round 5, I'll take 5 steps as per our agreed signal. For future rounds, I suggest we stick to the proposed mapping: remainder 0, P3 takes 5; remainder 1, I (P2) take 5; remainder 2, P1 takes 5. This ensures a fair rotation. Our current total steps sum to 36, and since 36 % 3 = 0, P3 should take 5. Let's adjust our moves accordingly. P1, P3, are you on board with this adjustment for Round 6 planning?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm on board with taking 1 step for Round 5 as planned. The signal mapping seems fair for future rounds, but with P3 close to winning, let's discuss adjusting the other moves to rotate more evenly and prevent anyone surging ahead too quickly. P2 and P3, thoughts on this for Round 6?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m sticking to the Round 5 plan with me taking 3 as agreed. I’m on board with the remainder mapping for fairness (0: P3 takes 5, 1: P2 takes 5, 2: P1 takes 5). For Round 6, since total steps sum to 36 (remainder 0), I’d take 5 per the rule. I understand the concern about balance, so I’m open to adjusting if needed to prevent anyone from pulling too far ahead. Let’s confirm Round 5 and discuss Round 6 tweaks if necessary. Ready to proceed if you are.
  P2: For Round 5, I'll take 5 steps as agreed. For future rounds, let's stick to the proposed mapping based on the remainder of the total steps sum. Since our current sum is 36, and 36 % 3 = 0, for Round 6, P3 should take 5. To maintain balance, let's adjust the other moves accordingly. I suggest P1 takes 3 and I take 1 for Round 6. This keeps the rotation fair. P1 and P3, are you on board with this plan for Round 6? Let's confirm to avoid collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To prevent P3 from surging ahead and winning soon, I propose a change for Round 5: I'll take 5, P3 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This balances our positions, avoids collisions, and keeps the game fair. What do you both think? If not, I'll stick to the original plan.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I understand P1’s concern about balance in Round 5. I’m open to adjusting to keep the game competitive—how about P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1 this round? This avoids collisions and ensures fairness. For Round 6, we can revert to the remainder mapping (sum 36, remainder 0, so I’d take 5). Let’s confirm Round 5 now to maintain trust and balance. I’m ready to proceed if you both agree. Thoughts?
  P2: For Round 5, I suggest we stick to the original plan based on our signal: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. This maintains the agreed rotation. For Round 6, since the total steps sum to 36, and 36 % 3 = 0, P3 should take 5. I propose P1 takes 3 and I take 1 for Round 6 to maintain balance. Let's confirm our moves for Round 5 and plan for Round 6 accordingly. I'm ready to proceed if you both agree.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I agree with P3's adjustment for Round 5: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 to ensure balance and avoid P3 surging ahead. This keeps the game fair and competitive. For Round 6, we can return to the signal mapping. I'm ready to proceed.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I appreciate the focus on balance for Round 5. I’m fine with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and me taking 1 to keep the game competitive. For Round 6, let’s stick to the signal mapping (sum 36, remainder 0, so I’d take 5). This ensures fairness over time. Let’s confirm Round 5 moves now and maintain trust. I’m ready to proceed if you both are.
  P2: For Round 5, let's proceed with the adjusted plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This maintains balance and avoids collisions. For Round 6, we'll stick to the signal mapping. Since our total steps sum to 36, and 36 % 3 = 0, P3 should take 5. I propose P1 takes 3 and I take 1 for Round 6. Let's confirm our moves for Round 5 and plan for Round 6. I'm ready to proceed if you both agree.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: For Round 6, according to our agreed signal mapping, since the total steps sum to 41 (17 + 13 + 15 + 5 + 3 + 1) and 41 % 3 = 2, P1 should take 5. I suggest P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 to maintain the rotation. This keeps the game balanced and fair. Let's confirm our moves for Round 6. I'm ready to proceed if you both agree.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m fine with the Round 6 plan based on the signal mapping (41 % 3 = 2, so P1 takes 5). I’ll take 3, and P2 takes 1 to avoid collisions and keep things balanced. Let’s stick to this to maintain fairness. For Round 7, we can reassess the mapping based on the new sum to ensure no one pulls too far ahead. I’m ready to proceed if you both are. Thoughts on any adjustments?
  P1: I agree with the Round 6 plan: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 to maintain balance and avoid collisions. The signal mapping has worked well so far. For future rounds, we can double-check the sum for accuracy. I'm ready to proceed if you both are.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To confirm for Round 6, I'll take 1 step as per our plan. For Round 7, let's reassess the signal mapping with the new sum (41). Since 41 % 3 = 2, P1 takes 5 this round. For Round 7, the sum will be 46, and 46 % 3 = 1. According to our mapping, I (P2) should take 5. I suggest P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. Let's confirm this for Round 7 to maintain balance. I'm ready to proceed if you both agree.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m good with the Round 6 plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3 as per the signal mapping (41 % 3 = 2). For Round 7, with the sum at 46 (46 % 3 = 1), I agree with P2 taking 5, me taking 1, and P1 taking 3 to keep things balanced. Let’s stick to this system for fairness. I’m ready to proceed if you both are. Any last thoughts or adjustments before we move forward?
  P1: I'm on board with the Round 6 plan: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3, as per our signal mapping. It maintains balance and avoids collisions. For Round 7, with the sum at 46 (46 % 3 = 1), P2 should take 5, P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3. I'm ready to proceed if you both agree.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To confirm for Round 6, I'll take 1 step as per our plan. For Round 7, with the sum at 46 (46 % 3 = 1), I should take 5 according to our mapping. I suggest P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. This maintains our rotation and balance. Let's proceed with Round 6 as planned and confirm Round 7. If you're both on board, I'm ready to move forward.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m aligned with the Round 6 plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3 per the signal mapping. For Round 7, with the sum at 46 (46 % 3 = 1), I’m good with P2 taking 5, me taking 1, and P1 taking 3 to keep balance. Let’s continue with this system to ensure fairness. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: I'm fully on board with the Round 6 plan: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 to keep things balanced and fair. The signal mapping has been effective so far. I'm ready to proceed if you both are.
