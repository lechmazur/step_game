This way, P2 can make significant progress while allowing the game to remain competitive. If P1 and P3 agree, P2 can choose 5, advancing to 12, while P1 takes 3 to reach 13, and P3 takes 1 to reach 14. In the next round, P2 can then take 5 again to reach 17 and win outright, provided P1 and P3 take smaller steps.
