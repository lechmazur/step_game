Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Let's all pick 5 this round to get a good start.
  P1: I'm skeptical of your suggestion to all pick 5. That seems too coordinated and might benefit you more than me. I'll need to understand your strategy better before agreeing to anything.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, picking 3 last round didn't work for either of us. P3 is now ahead. How about we both pick 5 this round to prevent them from getting further ahead?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I appreciate P2's suggestion, but I'm wary of blindly following their lead. Coordination sounds good, but could be a trap. P3's silence is intriguing. I want to understand everyone's motivations before committing to a specific move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, we both lost ground last round by colliding. P3 is pulling ahead. If we don't coordinate, P3 might win easily. Let's at least try to slow them down this round.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3 seems to be gaining an advantage by consistently moving 5 steps. P2 wants coordination, but their motives aren't fully clear. I'm hesitant to simply follow their lead. We need a strategy that prevents P3 from winning while also protecting my own interests.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is clearly ahead and has been consistently moving 5 steps. P2 seems eager to coordinate against them, but their strategy feels unreliable. I need to carefully consider my next move to prevent P3 from winning while maintaining my own strategic advantage.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, you're right to be cautious. My attempts to coordinate on 5 haven't worked. Since P3 is consistently picking 5, how about we both pick 3 this round? That way we both advance and P3 stays put.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is dangerously close to winning. P2's coordination attempts have been inconsistent. I need a strategic move that prevents P3's victory while advancing my position. We must disrupt their momentum, but I can't fully trust P2's suggestions. I'm considering a move that complicates their predictable pattern.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, let's stick with 3 again this round. It worked last time to keep P3 from advancing. If we both pick 3, we both move forward and P3 stays put.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is close to winning. P2's coordination attempts have been unreliable. We need a strategic disruption to prevent P3's imminent victory. I suggest we both choose a move that prevents P3 from advancing while positioning ourselves competitively. Coordination is crucial now, but trust is limited.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, you're right, P3 is close. Since they keep picking 5, how about we both pick 3 again? That stops P3 and lets us both advance. It worked in round 4.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, we need to stop P3 this round. They're likely to pick 5 again. If we both pick 3, we both advance and P3 stays put. This is our best chance to close the gap.
  P1: P2's repeated suggestion of both picking 3 seems like a calculated strategy, but I'm skeptical. P3 is close to winning, and their consistent 5-step moves suggest they're confident. I want to disrupt their momentum, but I can't fully trust P2's coordination. We need a move that prevents P3's victory while advancing my position strategically.
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is dangerously close to winning. P2's past coordination attempts have been unreliable. We both need to strategically prevent P3 from reaching 21 steps. I propose we carefully coordinate our moves to block their progress, but I won't blindly follow any single suggestion without careful consideration. Our moves must be calculated and unpredictable.
  P2: P1, you're right, we need to block P3. They've picked 5 every round they've advanced. Let's both pick 3 this round. That way we both move forward and P3 will likely pick 5 again and stay put.
  P3: <stop>


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, we need to repeat what we did last round. P3 is very close to winning and will likely pick 5 again. If we both pick 3, we both advance and P3 stays put. This is the most direct way to prevent them from winning this turn.
  P1: P2's strategy of consistently picking 3 to block P3 seems logical, but I'm wary of becoming too predictable. P3 is close to winning, and we need a move that disrupts their momentum while advancing our own position. I'm considering a strategic deviation from P2's suggested plan.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3 is extremely close to winning at 15 steps. P2 and I need a coordinated strategy to prevent their victory. However, P2's past suggestions have been inconsistent. I propose we both pick 3 this round to slow P3 down and maintain our chances of winning. This seems like our most strategic move to block their imminent win.
  P2: P1, you're right, P3 is dangerously close. My previous suggestions haven't always worked, but right now, picking 3 is the most direct way to stop P3 from winning this turn. If we both pick 3, we advance and P3 stays at 15. It's a simple, effective block.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, we absolutely must pick 3 this round. P3 is at 15 and will win if they pick 5 again. If we both pick 3, P3 stays at 15 and we both advance. This is the only way to prevent P3 from winning this turn. It's a temporary alliance to stop the immediate threat.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2's suggestion seems strategic, but I'm cautious. We both need to prevent P3 from winning, but blindly following P2's plan could be a trap. I'm considering our options carefully to maximize my own chances of victory while blocking P3's imminent win. Coordination is key, but I won't commit without careful thought.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you're right to be cautious, but this isn't a trap. P3 is one move of 5 away from winning. If we both pick 3, they don't win this round. It's a temporary truce to stop the biggest threat. After this round, we can re-evaluate. But right now, 3 is the only move that guarantees P3 doesn't win.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2's logic is compelling. P3 is one step away from winning if they choose 5 again. Coordinating on 3 seems like our best mutual defense. I agree we should both pick 3 this round to block P3's potential victory. Let's temporarily align to prevent an immediate loss for both of us.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, we absolutely must pick 3 again this round. P3 is at 20 and will win if they pick 1 or 5. If we both pick 3, P3 stays at 20 and we both advance. This is our last chance to stop them from winning this turn. It's critical we coordinate on this.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2's suggestion to pick 3 makes sense strategically. P3 is one step away from winning, and blocking their potential victory is crucial. However, I want to ensure this isn't just a ploy to manipulate my move. If we both pick 3, P3 remains at 20, giving us another chance to prevent their win. I'm leaning towards agreeing, but I'll need P2 to confirm their commitment to this strategy.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, this isn't a ploy. P3 is one step away. If they pick 1 or 5, they win. Our only chance to stop them *this turn* is if we both pick 3. Think of it as a temporary alliance against a common threat. If we don't, P3 wins.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: We're at a critical moment. P3 is one step from victory, and our only hope is coordinating to block their win. P2's strategy of both picking 3 seems logical, but I want explicit confirmation of their commitment. If we don't stop P3 this turn, the game is effectively over.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 25 steps
