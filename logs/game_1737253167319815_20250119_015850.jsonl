The initial proposal by P2 to choose different moves each turn\u2014P1 choosing 1, P2 choosing 3, and P3 choosing 5\u2014seems like a solid starting strategy. This approach allows each player to advance without overlapping, thereby minimizing the risk of being blocked due to choosing the same number.\n\nHowever, as the game progresses and players approach the target, the strategy may need to be adjusted. It is essential to consider the positions of all players and to plan moves accordingly to maximize individual chances of winning. One possible enhancement to the initial strategy could be to establish a rotating sequence for choosing moves or to adjust the chosen steps based on the current positions and the distance each player has to cover to reach 18 steps.\n\nMoreover, maintaining open communication during the conversation phases can help in coordinating moves effectively. By sharing intended moves or strategic plans, players can avoid collisions and optimize their progress. However, there is also a risk in revealing too much information, as it might allow other players to predict and counter one's moves.\n\nIn summary, starting with a coordinated plan where each player chooses a different number each turn is a prudent approach. As the game advances, players should remain flexible and be prepared to adjust their strategies based on the evolving game state and the positions of other players. Effective communication and coordination will be key to success in this game."}
