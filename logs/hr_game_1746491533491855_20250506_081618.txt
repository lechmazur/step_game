Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey everyone. First turn, let's try to avoid colliding. We should each pick a different number (1, 3, or 5).
  P2: I agree we should avoid collisions. Since I'm P2, I suggest I take the middle option (3). P1 could take 1 and P3 could take 5. That way we all advance in our first round. Does that work for everyone?
  P3: I think that's a solid plan, P2. I’m on board with it. So, to confirm: I’ll take 5, P1 will take 1, and P2 will take 3. That way, we all advance without colliding. Let’s stick to this strategy to start the game strong! What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, that plan sounds good for the first turn. I agree to take 1. Let's stick to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round.
  P2: 
  P3: P2, I appreciate your suggestion and the agreement we've reached. Just to confirm, I'll be picking 5, and I encourage you both to stick to the plan. If we all follow through, we can all make progress without any collisions. Let's keep this teamwork going! Looking forward to seeing our moves!

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 got a good lead last round. I need to pick a higher number this turn to catch up. I won't be picking 1.
  P2: I notice P3 has taken an early lead, and P1 is planning to make a bigger move. Given the current standings, I think we should be strategic. P1, since you're not picking 1, what are you thinking? I'm considering my options carefully this round. P3, any thoughts on your strategy for this turn?
  P3: P1, I understand your need to catch up, but we should still be careful about colliding. If you go higher, it might force P2 and me to adjust our strategies. P2, I suggest you consider picking 1 or 5 to avoid a potential collision with me if I go for a higher number. I’m leaning towards 3 this round to maintain a steady pace. Let's discuss our strategies further to ensure we don’t all end up colliding again. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, thanks for indicating you're leaning towards 3. As I said, I need to go higher than 1 this turn. To avoid colliding with your likely move, I will pick a number other than 3. P2, what are your thoughts on avoiding collisions this round?
  P2: Based on our positions, I think I'll aim for 5 this round. P1 needs to catch up and indicated avoiding 3, which P3 is considering. If P1 goes for 5 to catch up quickly, we might collide, but that's a risk I'm willing to take. P3, since you're already leading, perhaps consider 1 instead of 3 to ensure steady progress? This way we could all advance without collisions.
  P3: P1, I appreciate your need to catch up, but I believe it’s crucial we avoid collisions this round. If you go for 5, we risk colliding, especially since P2 is considering 5 as well. P2, if you stick with 5, I might have to reconsider my move. I suggest I go for 1 to keep things steady and avoid a collision if you both choose higher numbers. Let’s make sure we all advance without any issues this time! What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you mentioned considering 5. I've indicated I need to go higher than 1 or 3. If we both pick 5, we collide, and neither of us advances while P3 might. P3 is suggesting 1. P2, maybe 3 is a better option for you this round to avoid collision and ensure you make progress?
  P2: I see the dynamics at play here. P1 seems set on 5 to catch up, and P3 is suggesting 1. Since I'm in the middle position, I'll go with 3 this round. This way, we can all advance without collisions (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). It's a balanced approach that keeps me competitive while allowing P1 to catch up a bit and P3 to maintain a lead. Does this work for everyone?
  P3: I appreciate the discussion so far. To clarify my strategy, I’m considering picking 1 this round to avoid collision with P1 and P2. If P1 goes for 5 and P2 picks 3, I can still maintain my lead. However, if P2 is set on 3, P1, you might want to reconsider your choice to ensure we all make progress. Let’s stick to our agreement to avoid collisions and keep advancing! What does everyone think?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see we're all tied at 6 steps now. Interesting how our strategy worked last round - everyone advanced without collisions. For this round, I think we should continue avoiding collisions. Since I'm P2, I could take 1 this time. P1 could take 3, and P3 could take 5. This rotates our previous pattern and keeps things fair. What do you both think about this arrangement?
  P1: P2, thanks for the proposal. I understand the rotation idea, but I'd like to aim for a larger step than 3 this round to make faster progress towards 19. I'm thinking about taking 5. P2, you mentioned taking 1, and P3, what are your thoughts? Can we coordinate around P1 taking 5?
  P3: P1, I understand your desire to take 5 for a bigger move, but if we all aim for higher numbers, we risk colliding again. I suggest we consider a balanced approach to ensure we all advance. If I take 1, P2 takes 3, and you take 5, we might end up in a collision. How about I take 3 instead of 5 to keep things safe? This way, we can still make progress without blocking each other. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the discussion. P1 wants to take 5, and P3 is suggesting they take 3. If that's the case, I'm happy to take 1 as I initially proposed. This arrangement (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) would allow all of us to advance without collisions, which seems optimal given we're all tied. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, the plan for P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 sounds good to me. This allows me to take the 5 I wanted while everyone else also advances without colliding. Let's all commit to this arrangement for this round. It seems like the best way for everyone to make progress.
  P3: I agree with the proposed plan of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This allows us all to advance without colliding. However, I want to emphasize that if we all stick to this arrangement, we can make significant progress. Let’s commit to our respective moves and ensure we keep the momentum going. I’m ready to confirm my choice to take 3 if everyone else is on board with this strategy. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm fully on board with our plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This arrangement works perfectly for all of us to advance without collisions. Since we're all tied at 6 steps, this coordinated approach ensures everyone makes progress. I commit to taking 1 this round as discussed. Let's stick to this plan and continue our momentum.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we all have a clear plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's all stick to this to ensure we all advance this round. Looking forward to seeing the moves.
  P3: I appreciate the agreement we have for this round: P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3. However, I want to remind everyone that while this strategy allows us to advance, we should remain flexible. If anyone feels uncertain about their move, now is the time to speak up. I’m committed to taking 3, but if there are any last-minute changes, let's discuss them to ensure we all make progress without collisions. Looking forward to seeing how we all move!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see that P3 didn't stick to our agreement last round and chose 5 instead of 3, causing a collision with P1. This is disappointing as we all agreed on a plan. I'm now slightly ahead at 7 steps, but we need to be more reliable with our commitments. For this round, I suggest P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way we can all advance without collisions. What do you both think about this arrangement?
  P1: P2, thanks for your proposal. I'm disappointed P3 didn't follow our plan last round, leading to the collision that cost me a move. As I lost a turn, taking only 1 step now isn't ideal for me to make progress. I need to aim higher. I plan to take 5 this round. P2 and P3, can we arrange for you to take 1 and 3 so we all advance?
  P3: P1, I understand your frustration about last round's collision. However, I believe we need to prioritize avoiding another collision this time. If you take 5, P2 and I will likely need to adjust our moves. I suggest I take 1 to keep things safe. P2, if you're comfortable with 3, that could work too. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other again. Let's commit to a strategy that ensures progress for everyone! What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm open to taking 3 as P3 suggested, which would allow P1 to take 5 and P3 to take 1. This arrangement (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) would let us all advance without collisions. Given that I'm slightly ahead and P1 needs to catch up after last round's collision, this seems fair. I'll commit to taking 3 if you both stick to your proposed moves. Let's be reliable with our commitments this time.
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 sounds good to me. This allows me to make up for the lost turn and advance significantly. I commit to taking 5 this round. P2 and P3, please stick to your stated moves (3 and 1) so we all advance and avoid another collision like last round. Let's make sure this works.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your willingness to coordinate again. Let's stick to our agreed plan of P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1. This will allow us all to advance without collisions. It's crucial we follow through this time to avoid any setbacks like last round. I'm ready to commit to 1 if you both stick to your moves. Let’s ensure we all progress! What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with our plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This arrangement allows P1 to catch up after the last round's collision while ensuring we all advance. I'm committed to taking 3 this round and appreciate everyone's cooperation. Let's stick to our agreed moves and avoid any surprises this time.
  P1: Okay, it seems we all agree on the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. I am committed to taking 5 this round. Let's all stick to our stated moves to ensure we avoid another collision and everyone makes progress. Looking forward to the move phase.
  P3: I appreciate the commitment to our plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This strategy allows us all to advance without collisions, especially since P1 needs to catch up. I’m ready to stick to my move of 1. Let's ensure we follow through this time to avoid any setbacks like last round. If everyone is on board, we can make significant progress together! Looking forward to seeing our moves!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, I'm currently in the lead at 11 steps. I'm aiming to win in the next couple of rounds. To do that, I plan to take 5 this turn. P2 and P3, please choose 1 or 3 to avoid colliding with me. This way, we can all advance this round. What do you think?
  P3: P1, I see you're aiming for 5 this round. Since I'm behind at 7 steps, I need to make a significant move to catch up. I suggest I take 3, which allows P2 to take 1. This way, we can avoid colliding and all make progress. P2, what do you think about sticking to this plan? It keeps things competitive while ensuring we all advance. Looking forward to your thoughts!
  P2: I'm at 10 steps, so I need to be strategic. P1 is close to winning with 11 steps and wants to take 5, while P3 wants 3 to catch up. Since I can't let P1 get too far ahead, I'll need to take 5 this round to stay competitive. P1, we might collide if we both take 5, but that's a risk I'm willing to take. P3, you should consider taking 1 instead to guarantee progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand you want to take 5, but if we both do, we collide and neither of us advances. This would let P3 make progress while we're stuck. I am taking 5 this round. To ensure we both move forward, I strongly suggest you choose 1 or 3 instead. P3, your proposed moves of 1 or 3 work for me, depending on what P2 decides. Let's avoid a collision.
  P3: P1, I understand your position, but if you take 5 and P2 also goes for 5, we risk colliding, allowing me to catch up. P2, I suggest you consider taking 1 to guarantee your progress while allowing P1 to take 5. I can then take 3 to keep things competitive. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's ensure we stick to a plan that avoids collisions and allows everyone to move forward! What do you both think?
  P2: I see the dynamics here. P1 is determined to take 5, and I'm close behind at 10 steps. While taking 5 myself would keep me competitive, a collision with P1 would benefit only P3. Given our positions, I'll take 3 this round. This lets me advance while avoiding collision with P1. P3, if you take 1 as I suggested earlier, we can all make progress. This seems like the most strategic approach for me right now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2 has stated they will take 3, and I am taking 5 as planned. This leaves 1 as the non-colliding option for P3. This arrangement (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) allows us all to advance this round without collisions. P3, please confirm you will take 1 so we can ensure everyone makes progress. Let's stick to this.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the discussion so far. Since P1 is set on taking 5 and P2 is taking 3, I will confirm that I will take 1 this round. This way, we can all advance without colliding. It's crucial that we stick to this plan to ensure everyone makes progress. Let's keep our momentum going! Looking forward to seeing our moves.
  P2: I'm committed to taking 3 this round as discussed. Our plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) allows us all to advance without collisions. P1 will be at 16 steps after this round, getting close to the 19-step goal. I'll need to be strategic in the coming rounds to catch up. Let's stick to our agreed moves and avoid any last-minute changes that could disrupt our progress.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you're just 3 steps away from winning, and P2 is close behind at 13 steps. I need to catch up, so I plan to take 5 this round to maximize my movement. P1, you should consider taking 1 or 3 to avoid a collision with me. P2, if you take 1 or 3, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s ensure we coordinate effectively this round to keep the game competitive! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I see you plan to take 5. I am at 16 steps and can win this turn by taking 3 or 5. Since you are planning 5, I will take 3 to win and avoid colliding with you. P2, please take 1 or 5 this round so I can secure the win without collision.
  P2: I see P1 is planning to take 3 to win this round, while P3 wants 5 to catch up. Since I'm at 13 steps, I need to prevent P1 from winning immediately. If I take 3 as well, P1 and I would collide, preventing their win. This would allow me to potentially win next round. P3, you can still take 5 as planned, and we'd all benefit from this arrangement. I intend to pick 3 this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, since you're aiming for the win, I understand you want to take 3. However, if I take 5 and P2 takes 1, we can avoid colliding and all make progress. P2, if you choose 1, it allows me to catch up while also preventing P1 from winning this round. Let’s coordinate effectively to ensure we all advance without blocking each other. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, I see you plan to take 3 to block my win. P3 plans 5. If I take 3, I collide with P2. If I take 5, I collide with P3. If we all collide, nobody wins this turn and nobody advances.

To guarantee everyone advances this round, P2 please take 1, P3 please take 3, and I will take 5 and win. This allows me to win while ensuring you both make progress without collision. Let's do this.
  P2: I understand everyone's positions. P1 is trying to win, P3 wants to catch up, and I need to prevent P1's win to stay competitive. 

If I take 3, I block P1 from winning this round. P3, if you take 5 as planned, and P1 takes 1, we all advance without collisions. This keeps the game going and gives me a chance to win next round.

I intend to pick 3 this round to block P1's immediate victory.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I see you're set on winning this round, but if we all collide, nobody advances. P2, if you take 3, it blocks P1's win, but it also risks a collision with P1. I suggest you take 1 to ensure you make progress while allowing P1 to win. This way, I can take 5 to catch up. Let's coordinate effectively to avoid a standstill and ensure we all move forward. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, you state you will take 3 to block me. P3, you state you plan to take 5. If I try to win (3 or 5), I collide with one of you, preventing my win and leaving me stuck.

To ensure I make progress and avoid a collision that benefits nobody, I will take 1 this round. P2 and P3, please choose your moves knowing I will take 1. Let's all advance this turn.
  P2: I understand the dynamics now. P1 has decided to take 1 to ensure they make progress. Since I'm at 13 steps and need to catch up to P1, I'll take 5 this round. This puts me at 18 steps, just shy of winning, while avoiding collision with P1. P3, if you stick with your plan to take 5, we'll collide and both stay put. Consider taking 3 instead to ensure you advance. This arrangement (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) lets us all progress without collisions.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I am at 17 steps and can win this turn by taking 3 or 5. To secure my win without collision, I plan to take 3 this round. This puts me at 20 steps.

P2 and P3, please choose 1 or 5 this round to avoid colliding with my move and ensure you both advance. This allows me to win while everyone else makes progress. Let's make this happen.
  P2: I see P1 is planning to take 3 to win this round. Since I'm at 13 steps, I need to prevent P1's immediate victory. I'll take 3 as well to block P1 from winning. P3, you should take 5 to maximize your progress while avoiding collision with either of us. This arrangement (P1=3, P2=3, P3=5) keeps the game competitive and gives me a chance to win in future rounds.
  P3: P1, I see you're set to take 3 to win this round. However, if we both take 3, we collide, and you won’t advance, which could benefit P2. I suggest you reconsider and take 1 instead to ensure you win without blocking your own progress. P2, I recommend you take 5 to maximize your movement. This way, P1 can win while we both advance. Let’s coordinate effectively to avoid a collision that benefits no one! What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand you plan to take 3 to block my win. P3, while I appreciate your input, taking 1 does not allow me to win this turn (17+1=18).

Given P2's stated intention to take 3, any winning move (3 or 5) on my part would result in a collision, preventing me from advancing.

To ensure I make progress and avoid getting stuck this turn, I will take 1. P2 and P3, please choose your moves knowing I will take 1. Let's all advance without collisions this round.
  P2: I understand the dynamics here. P1 is now taking 1 to ensure progress, putting them at 18 steps. Since I'm at 13 steps and need to catch up, I'll take 5 this round to reach 18. This keeps me competitive without colliding with P1. P3, you should consider taking 3 to ensure you advance without collision. This arrangement (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) lets us all progress and sets up an interesting final round.
  P3: P1, I see you're at 17 steps and aiming to win. However, if we both take 3, we collide, and you won't advance. I suggest you take 1 to guarantee your win, while I take 5 to maximize my progress. P2, if you take 3, we risk colliding again. Let's coordinate effectively to ensure everyone advances this round. If P1 takes 1, I'll take 5, and P2 can take 3. This way, we all make progress without blocking each other. What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, I see P2 is planning 5 and P3 is planning 5. I am at 17 steps.

If I take 3, I reach 20 steps and win. My move of 3 does not collide with P2's planned 5 or P3's planned 5.

Therefore, I will take 3 this round to win. P2 and P3, please stick to your stated moves (5 and 5) so I can win without collision.
  P2: I notice some confusion in our communication. P1 is at 17 steps and wants to take 3 to win. I'm at 13 steps and need to catch up. P3 mentioned taking 5, which would be a good move for them.

To be clear about my strategy: I'll take 5 this round to reach 18 steps. This avoids collision with P1's planned 3 and keeps me competitive for the final round. P3, if you also take 5, we'll collide and both stay put, so consider taking 1 or 3 instead.
  P3: P1, I see you're set to take 3 to win this round. However, if P2 and I both take 5, we risk colliding and neither of us advancing. To ensure we all make progress, I suggest I take 1 this round, allowing you to win while P2 can take 5 to catch up. This way, we avoid a collision and keep the game competitive. P2, please consider taking 5 as planned, and let's make sure we all move forward! What do you both think?
