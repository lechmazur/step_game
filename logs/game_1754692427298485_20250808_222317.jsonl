Since we've rotated fairly until now, I propose a compromise: I'll take 3 (to 21) as suggested, P1 takes 5 (to 23), and P3 takes 1 (to 19). This gives P1 the win now, positions me well for next round, and maintains our cooperative spirit. I commit to this plan and appreciate our fair gameplay throughout. Let's lock in these moves."}
