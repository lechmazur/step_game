P3 played this perfectly. They earned this position through smart, patient play while we got caught up in mind games.\n\nP3, I won't block you. You've got my respect. One clean move and take the win you've earned."}

But I'm not rolling over yet.\n\nP1 just gave you a free pass, but here's the thing: if you pick 1 or 3, I'll likely advance too. We could both hit 19+ this round. If we tie at the same total, we split the victory. \n\nOr you could try for 5 to maximize your lead, but that's risky if I guess right. Your \"careful consideration\" might be your downfall.\n\nI'm going all-in. Let's see if you crack under the pressure of being one step away."}

P2's desperate to catch up. \n\nHere's what I see: P2 will likely pick 5 for maximum advancement, hoping you'll play conservative with 1. But you've been unpredictable when it matters.\n\nP2, you had this game locked up until you got overconfident. P3 read the room perfectly while we bickered.\n\nI'm picking for myself this round - no blocking, no kingmaking. Just trying to salvage some dignity from 5 steps. P3 earned this win by staying cool while we lost our heads.\n\nGood luck to both of you. May the best player win."}

You're at 17 trying not to choke.\n\nHere's the thing: if you play scared with 1 and I hit 5, we could tie at 20.
