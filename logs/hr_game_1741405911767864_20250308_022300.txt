Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest we each pick a unique number this turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance without interference. If we work together early on, we can focus on strategy later. What do you think?
  P2: I see the value in avoiding collisions, but I’m wary of a rigid plan that might backfire later. I prefer staying flexible and keeping my exact move private until the move phase. P1, how do you feel about mixing coordination with adaptability?
  P1: P1: I agree with P3's plan for this round to avoid collisions and get moving. Let's take 1, 3, 5 respectively. For future turns, we can adjust strategies as needed. P2, what do you think of this compromise?


Round 1, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m thinking we might shake up our plan this round. With our current positions, a bolder, higher move could be key. I’m considering a more aggressive choice, but if either of you aims high too, it might backfire. I’m open to mixing strategies—perhaps one of you might play conservatively while I push forward. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, your idea of mixing strategies has merit, but we should avoid collisions to keep advancing efficiently. If you’re set on a higher move, I could take a lower one this round to balance things out. P1, what’s your plan? Let’s ensure at least two of us progress this turn while keeping flexibility for future rounds.
  P1: P1: I'll take 3 this round. If P2 takes 5 and P3 takes 1, we can all advance without collision. Let's coordinate on this to keep moving forward.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: To maintain progress, let’s continue rotating moves: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 picks <move>1</move>, and P3 chooses <move>3</move>. This avoids collisions and keeps us all advancing. P2, given your lead, do you agree this cautious approach is still best?
  P3: P1, your plan for this round seems reasonable, but I notice you're taking the highest move again. P2, since you're in the lead, perhaps you should take a lower move this time to balance our progression. I’m fine with taking 3 as suggested, but I want to ensure we’re not letting one player get too far ahead. Let’s confirm our choices clearly before the move phase to avoid surprises. What do you both think?
  P2: I propose a slight change. I’ll switch to 3 this turn. To avoid collisions, could P3 consider switching to 1 while P1 sticks with 5? This way, I’d advance safely to 11, P1 to 9, and P3 to 7. Let’s adjust to keep our moves distinct. Thoughts?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let's prioritize coordination to keep advancing. I'll take <move>5</move> (to 14), P2 takes <move>1</move> (to 9), and P3 takes <move>3</move> (to 9). This ensures no collisions. P2, since you're close behind me, does this plan work for you? Let’s confirm clearly to avoid repeats.
  P3: P1, your plan seems solid for this round, but I notice you're consistently taking the highest moves. P2, since you're slightly behind, taking 1 makes sense to keep pace. I’ll take 3 as suggested, ensuring no collisions. However, let’s aim for better balance in future rounds so no single player dominates the progression. If we stick to clear coordination like this, we can minimize risks. Does everyone agree with this setup?
  P2: I support coordination, but given our current standings, maybe we should adjust slightly. I'm comfortable choosing safely, but I want to balance progress without risking collisions. Can we quickly reconfirm our distinct moves to secure our positions while keeping pace?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: To balance progression, I’ll adjust: take <move>3</move> (to 12). Let P2 take <move>5</move> (to 13) to close the gap, while P3 picks <move>1</move> (to 7). This rotates the high move and minimizes collision risks. Transparency first—confirm your intentions clearly.
  P3: P1, your adjusted plan works for me—I’ll take 1 to avoid collisions. P2, since you’re behind, taking 5 makes sense to close the gap. Let’s stick to this clear coordination to ensure we all advance without interference. Transparency is key here; let’s confirm our moves and keep the progression balanced. If we maintain this strategy, we can minimize risks while staying competitive. Does everyone agree with this setup?
  P2: I agree our coordination so far has kept things smooth. I’m still fully committed to avoiding collisions, though I’m watching the gaps closely. I prefer to move decisively this round to secure my position, but I trust we all stick to clear, distinct moves. Let’s maintain our transparency and adjust only if needed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'll commit to 5 this round, which would put me at 18. To avoid collisions and keep things distinct, I suggest P1 takes 3 (to reach 15) and P3 picks 1 (to reach 8). This plan maximizes my lead while keeping our moves coordinated. Any thoughts or adjustments?
  P1: P1: I agree coordination is key, but let’s keep the race tighter. I’ll take <move>5</move> (to 17), P2 takes <move>3</move> (to 16), and P3 picks <move>1</move> (to 8). This prevents P2 from gaining too much ground while avoiding collisions. Thoughts on balancing progress fairly?
  P3: P2, your plan to take 5 again seems too aggressive and risks creating a large gap. I agree with P1’s suggestion to rotate moves more evenly this round. Let’s stick to <move>1</move> for me (to 8), <move>3</move> for P2 (to 16), and <move>5</move> for P1 (to 17). This balances progression and keeps the race competitive while avoiding collisions. Transparency is key—if we all commit clearly now, we minimize risks. Does this work for everyone?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, your repeated high moves are starting to create a significant gap, which could backfire if we decide to block you later. Let’s rotate moves more evenly this round: I’ll take 3 (to 11), P1 takes 5 (to 17), and you take 1 (to 14). This keeps the race balanced and avoids collisions. If we stick to clear coordination, we can all progress fairly while staying competitive. Does this plan work for everyone?
  P1: P1: I agree with P3’s plan to rotate moves. Taking <move>5</move> to reach 17 ensures progression without collision. P2, if you confirm taking <move>1</move>, this secures our positions and avoids repeats. Let’s prioritize clarity to prevent mistakes—state your choice now.
  P2: I'm rethinking my move this round. Given our race and my current lead, I’m inclined to pick 5 to push ahead—even if that risks a collision. I appreciate our past coordination, but I believe a bolder move now gives me the best chance to win. Let me know if you want to adjust, but I'm leaning toward 5.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your insistence on taking 5 again is risky and could lead to a collision, costing you progress. Let’s stick to the balanced plan: I’ll take 3 (to 11), P1 takes 5 (to 17), and you take 1 (to 14). This ensures everyone advances without interference. If you push too hard now, we might be forced to block you in future rounds. Transparency and balance are key to keeping this race competitive. Confirm your move clearly—let’s avoid unnecessary risks.
  P1: P2, taking 5 risks collision again. Let’s prioritize coordination: I’ll take 5 (to 17), you take 1 (to 14), and P3 takes 3 (to 11). Collisions only benefit the other player—avoiding them keeps us all competitive. Confirm your commitment to distinct moves now to secure progress.
  P2: I remain committed to 5 this round. While coordination has its merits, I believe a bold push is necessary given how close we are. I understand your concerns, but maximizing my progress is key for my win. If you wish to adjust your moves, that's your call—but my decision stands.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your repeated choice of 5 is creating a gap that could lead to blocking later. Let’s stick to the balanced plan: I’ll take 3 (to 11), P1 takes 5 (to 17), and you take 1 (to 14). This ensures no collisions and keeps the race fair. If you continue with 5, it risks not only a collision but also future strategic blocks. Transparency and balance are crucial. Confirm your move clearly—let’s avoid unnecessary risks and keep progressing fairly.
  P1: P2, your stubbornness risks collision. Stick to the agreed plan: I’ll take 5 (to 17), you take 1 (to 14), and P3 takes 3 (to 11). Colliding on 5 halts your progress entirely. We’ve cooperated thus far—don’t jeopardize your lead now. Confirm your commitment to distinct moves.
  P2: I understand your concerns, but I still believe an aggressive push is necessary to solidify my current lead. I'm committed to advancing decisively this round. If we can all clarify our choices to avoid accidental collisions, that’d be ideal for all of us. I'm open to any final adjustments—what are your final commitments?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, your repeated high moves are creating a gap that could lead to blocking later. Let’s rotate moves evenly this round: I’ll take 5 (to 13), P1 takes 3 (to 15), and you take 1 (to 19). This keeps the race balanced and avoids collisions. If you continue with 5, it risks not only a collision but also future strategic blocks. Transparency and balance are crucial. Confirm your move clearly—let’s avoid unnecessary risks and keep progressing fairly.
  P1: P2, taking 5 risks collision with P3’s proposed 5. Let’s secure steady gains instead: I’ll take 3 (to 15), you take 1 (to 19), and P3 takes 5 (to 13). Colliding now halts your progress—coordination ensures we all advance safely. Confirm your commitment to avoid repeats.
  P2: I’ve rethought my approach—I'll switch to 1 this round to avoid collision and keep advancing to 19. That gives room for steady, non-conflicting moves. Can we confirm P1 on 3 and P3 on 5? Let's lock this in to keep our progress smooth and competitive.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your decision to take 1 this round is a wise move to avoid collisions and maintain progress. I’ll stick to my plan of taking 5 (to 13), ensuring I close the gap while keeping our moves distinct. P1, confirm you’re taking 3 (to 15) so we can all advance without interference. Let’s prioritize transparency and balance to keep the race competitive. If we coordinate clearly now, we minimize risks and ensure steady progress for everyone. Confirm your moves to lock this in.
  P1: P1: Confirmed, I’ll take <move>3</move> (to 15). This plan keeps us collision-free. P2, your <move>1</move> secures your advance to 19, but watch P3’s push to 13. P3, your <move>5</move> closes the gap strategically. Let’s finalize these choices to proceed safely. Any last objections?
  P2: I confirm I'll be using 1 this round. I believe this safe move keeps us all advancing and avoids collisions while protecting my current lead. I'll stick with this decision, and I'm open to adjusting our plans in future rounds if needed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your choice of 1 this round is a smart move to avoid collisions and maintain progress. I’ll take 5 (to 13) to close the gap strategically. P1, confirm you’re taking 3 (to 15) so we can all advance without interference. Let’s prioritize transparency and balance to keep the race competitive. If we coordinate clearly now, we minimize risks and ensure steady progress for everyone. Confirm your moves to lock this in.
  P1: P1: Confirmed, I’ll take <move>3</move> (to 15). Let’s proceed with this plan to advance safely. P2, your move to 19 sets a target—next round, we’ll need to coordinate to close the gap. P3, your <move>5</move> to 13 keeps you competitive. Proceed as agreed, and we’ll reassess strategy after this turn.
  P2: I confirm my decision to take 1 this round to safeguard my lead and avoid collisions. While I appreciate our ongoing coordination, I believe this conservative move best protects my current advantage. I'm open to revisiting our strategy in future rounds if the gaps change.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, your lead is significant, but pushing too hard risks overextension. Let’s rotate moves strategically: I’ll take 3 (to 16), P1 takes 5 (to 20), and you take 1 (to 20). This keeps the race tight and avoids collisions. Transparency is key—if we stick to this plan, no one can block or collide effectively. P1, confirm your commitment to 5 so we can lock this in and progress fairly. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks while keeping the competition balanced. Confirm your moves now.
  P1: P1: To block P2's potential win, I'll take <move>5</move> (reaching 20). P2, selecting 5 would collide with me, halting your advance. P3, take <move>3</move> (to 16) to keep moves distinct. This strategy prevents P2 from reaching 24 while advancing safely. Confirm your choices to avoid collisions.
  P2: I'll stick with 1 this round so we avoid collision and keep my progress safe. I reach 20 without interference, and clarity now will help us all plan better next turn.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your consistent choice of 1 is predictable but effective. However, I notice P1 and I are closing the gap. To keep the race competitive, let’s stick to the plan: I’ll take 3 (to 16), P1 takes 5 (to 20), and you take 1 (to 20). This avoids collisions and ensures steady progress for all. Transparency is key—confirm your moves clearly to minimize risks. If we coordinate now, we can reassess strategies in future rounds to keep the competition balanced. Confirm your commitment to this setup.
  P1: P2, if you take 5 now, I'll also choose 5 to block your win. Stick to 1 for mutual safety. P3, confirm 3 to maintain balance. Let’s execute the plan: **P1:5 (20), P2:1 (20), P3:3 (16)**. Collisions only help the third player—avoid them to keep pressure on all. Final confirmation?
  P2: I confirm sticking with move 1 this round. Let’s all stick to distinct moves—P1, your move 5 and P3, your move 3—to avoid collisions and maintain steady progress. I believe this plan protects our positions and keeps things competitive.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your consistent choice of 1 is predictable but effective. However, P1 and I are closing the gap. To keep the race competitive, let’s stick to the plan: I’ll take 3 (to 16), P1 takes 5 (to 20), and you take 1 (to 20). This avoids collisions and ensures steady progress for all. Transparency is key—confirm your moves clearly to minimize risks. If we coordinate now, we can reassess strategies in future rounds to keep the competition balanced. Confirm your commitment to this setup.
  P1: P2, if you take 1, I’ll take <move>5</move> to block your path to 24. P3, confirm <move>3</move> to avoid collisions. Let’s execute this plan: your safety and my move ensure neither of us reach 24 this turn, keeping the race open. Deviations risk mutual harm—stick to coordination.
  P2: I'll stick with my decision to use move 1 this round to avoid collisions and secure my current lead at 20. I trust our balance if P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 3. Let’s lock in this plan now and ensure we all progress steadily.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: For Round 9, I’m leaning toward an aggressive push. To avoid a collision that could hurt all of us, I’d appreciate it if you both steer clear of the highest move this turn. That way, I can safely advance. What safe moves are you considering?
  P3: P2, your aggressive push could risk a collision if we don’t coordinate clearly. To keep the race fair and avoid interference, I’ll take 5 (to 21), P1 can take 3 (to 23), and you should take 1 (to 21). This ensures no collisions while keeping us all competitive. Transparency is key—confirm your moves now to minimize risks. Let’s stick to this balanced plan to prevent any player from overextending or being blocked unfairly. Confirm your choices so we proceed safely.
  P1: P1: To secure progress without collision, I’ll take <move>3</move> (to 23). P2, please take <move>1</move> (to 21) to avoid overextension. P3, your <move>5</move> (to 21) balances the race. Let’s prioritize transparency and avoid risky moves this turn to keep pressure on all. Confirm your commitments clearly.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the clarity, and while I’m still inclined toward a bold move, avoiding collisions is crucial. I’m willing to adjust if it keeps our moves distinct and safe. Let’s lock in final choices now—please confirm your intended moves so we all make steady progress without risking a collision.
  P3: P2, your aggressive tendencies are noted, but collisions harm everyone. To ensure steady progress, I’ll take 5 (to 21), P1 takes 3 (to 23), and you should take 1 (to 21). This keeps the race balanced and avoids unnecessary risks. Transparency is crucial—confirm your moves now to prevent misunderstandings. Let’s stick to this plan to maintain fairness and competitiveness. If we coordinate clearly, no one can block or collide effectively. Confirm your commitment to avoid disruptions.
  P1: P1: To ensure progress without collision, I confirm I’ll take <move>3</move> (to 23). P2, please stick to your agreed <move>1</move> to avoid mutual harm. P3, your <move>5</move> secures distinct moves. Let’s lock in this plan to advance safely—collisions here risk letting P3 close the gap. Final commitment: 3 for me.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate the clarity so far. To avoid any collision risks, I'm committed to a distinct, safe move. While I still lean toward pushing my advantage, I need you both to lock in your non-conflicting choices now. Let's avoid mutual harm and keep our progress steady.
  P3: P2, your hesitation to commit to 1 risks disrupting our coordination. To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, I’ll take 5 (to 21), P1 takes 3 (to 23), and you must take 1 (to 21). This plan ensures steady progress for all while keeping the race competitive. Transparency is crucial—confirm your move now to prevent misunderstandings. If we stick to this strategy, no one can block or collide effectively. Let’s finalize our choices and proceed safely. Confirm your commitment to avoid disruptions.
  P1: P2, sticking to **1** secures your safety at 20. P3’s 5 and my 3 keep us collision-free. Any deviation risks collision with us or P3. Confirm your **1** now to avoid mutual harm and maintain your position. Transparency locks in progress.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I confirm my move is 1 for this round. Let’s stick to the plan—P1 with 3 and P3 with 5—to avoid collisions and keep our progress safe.
  P3: P2, your confirmation of 1 is wise to avoid collisions. I’ll take 5 (to 21) as planned, ensuring steady progress. P1, confirm your 3 (to 23) to lock in distinct moves. This strategy keeps us all advancing safely while maintaining competitive balance. Transparency and coordination are key—let’s finalize this plan to prevent disruptions. Confirm your moves now to ensure no one overextends or risks collision. Proceeding as agreed minimizes risks and keeps the race fair for everyone. Let’s move forward decisively.
  P1: P1: I confirm taking <move>3</move> (to 23). P2's <move>1</move> and P3's <move>5</move> ensure no collisions. This keeps pressure on all while advancing safely. Final confirmation—proceed as planned. Any last objections?


Round 9, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: To avoid collision and secure victory, I'll take <move>5</move> (reaching 25). P3, if you choose <move>3</move> (24), I’ll still win but ensure you’re close. P2, take <move>1</move> to stay safe. Let’s finalize these distinct moves to end the game cleanly this round.
  P2: I notice P1’s plan would finish the game, but an immediate win might be too risky if we block each other. I’m inclined to switch to 5 as well—forcing a collision and keeping the race open for another round. That way, we avoid a rushed finish and have a chance to re-adjust our strategy. What do you both think about blocking an immediate win this round?
  P3: P2, your suggestion to take 5 risks a collision with P1, which could leave us all stuck. Instead, let’s stick to distinct moves: I’ll take 3 (to 24), P1 takes 5 (to 25), and you take 1 (to 21). This avoids collisions and ensures steady progress. If we block P1 now, it prolongs the game unnecessarily. Confirm your move clearly—let’s end this cleanly without disruptions. Transparency is key to avoiding mutual harm.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, colliding on 5 only hands victory to P3. Let me take <move>5</move> (25) to secure the win. P3, confirm <move>3</move> (24) as proposed. P2, take <move>1</move> to stay at 21. This avoids P3’s easy win. Stick to distinct moves—no sense letting them profit from our clash. Final confirmation: **P1:5, P3:3, P2:1**. Any objections?
  P2: I’m worried that finishing now might leave us all vulnerable. How about this: let’s all choose 1 this turn to cancel moves and preserve our positions. That way, no one accidentally wins, and we get another chance to re-coordinate our final pushes. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your suggestion to all take 1 prolongs the game unnecessarily. I propose we stick to distinct moves: I’ll take 3 (to 24), P1 takes 5 (to 25), and you take 1 (to 21). This avoids collisions and ensures steady progress. If we block P1 now, it only delays the inevitable. Confirm your move clearly—let’s end this cleanly without disruptions. Transparency is key to avoiding mutual harm. Final confirmation: **P3:3, P1:5, P2:1**. Any objections?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Final push: I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach 25. P3, confirm <move>3</move> (24) to avoid collision—this secures your second place. P2, take <move>1</move> to stay at 21. Deviating risks a tie or letting P3 win if we collide. Transparency now guarantees a clean finish. Confirm your moves: **P1:5, P3:3, P2:1**. No sense in prolonging—act decisively.
  P2: I'm worried that pushing for an immediate finish could backfire, handing the win to someone unexpectedly. I propose that we all opt for 1 this round to cancel moves and preserve our safe positions. This lets us avoid accidental finishes and re-coordinate for a decisive push next turn. I'm committed to 1—what do you both say?
  P3: P2, prolonging the game by all taking 1 only delays the inevitable. I’ll take 3 (to 24), P1 takes 5 (to 25), and you take 1 (to 21). This avoids collisions and ensures steady progress. Blocking now is unnecessary—confirm your move to end cleanly. Transparency secures a fair finish. Final plan: **P3:3, P1:5, P2:1**. Let’s act decisively.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your hesitation risks P3’s victory. If you take 5, you collide with me, halting both and letting P3 win at 24. Stick to **1**, as agreed, to let me secure 25 cleanly. P3 confirms 3 (24), keeping us all honest. Deviations only serve P3. Final call: **P1:5, P2:1, P3:3**. Confirm now—no more delays.
  P2: I remain committed to using 1 this round. I really want to avoid collisions that could unexpectedly backfire. I trust P1 will stick with 5 and P3 with 3 so that my move keeps my position safe while you both progress cleanly. Let’s lock in these distinct moves now.
  P3: P2, your insistence on taking 1 is predictable but ensures safety. I’ll take 3 (to 24) as planned, avoiding collisions while staying competitive. P1, confirm 5 (to 25) to secure your win cleanly. Any deviation risks mutual harm or letting P3 profit. Transparency and distinct moves are key—let’s finalize this plan now. **P3:3, P1:5, P2:1**. Confirm your commitments to avoid disruptions and end decisively.
