Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to all move this round. How about P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5? What do you think?
  P1: I appreciate the suggestion, but I’m not fully sold on complete coordination. A fixed plan might lead to collisions that could actually benefit someone else. I'm considering a slight deviation if it gives me the edge.
  P3: P3: I understand your concerns, P1. Maybe we can stay flexible and adjust our moves each turn to minimize overlaps. Let’s keep our options open to avoid collisions and maximize our progress.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, I understand your points P1 and P3.  Perhaps being too rigid is not ideal.  How about we aim to pick different move types *this round* just to get us all moving forward?  We can adjust our strategy later.  Does that sound reasonable?
  P1: I'm not sold on a fully predetermined pattern. If you both commit too rigidly, I may take advantage with a less expected move. Unpredictability can be a strength, so let's stay flexible and avoid obvious collisions.
  P3: P3: To minimize collisions, I'll choose to move 5 this round. How about you, P1 and P2?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P3, I'm considering 1 or 3 to avoid collision with your 5. P1, your thoughts?
  P1: P3, noting your choice, I’ll likely lean toward 3, but I’ll keep flexibility for any adjustments. P2, with 1 and 3 left for you, consider that unpredictability might be our best asset this round.
  P3: P3: I'll stick with moving 5 this round. P1, P2, please choose different moves (1 or 3) to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let’s make this turn effective!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay everyone, good moves last round! To keep us all progressing, how about we try a different set this round? Perhaps P2 takes 5 to catch up a bit, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This is just a suggestion to avoid collisions and keep us moving forward. What do you think?
  P3: I'll choose 5 this round to maximize my progress. P1 and P2, please pick different moves (1 or 3) to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. Let’s keep the momentum going!
  P1: I appreciate both suggestions. With P3 committed to 5, I'll keep my options flexible between 1 and 3 to reduce collision risk. P2, consider choosing a move that complements ours rather than overlaps. I'm focused on maximizing progress without sacrificing unpredictability.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P1, I'm flexible too. Since P3 is set on 5, and you're considering 1 or 3, I'll plan to take whichever of 1 or 3 you *don't* choose to ensure we all move forward again this round. Let's keep progressing.
  P3: P3: I'll stick with 5 this round. P1 and P2, please choose different moves (1 or 3) to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let’s keep up the momentum!
  P1: P2, I'm leaning toward 3 this round, especially with P3 at 5. If you feel confident picking 1, that works for me—but I'll remain alert if you switch. I'm focused on maximizing my progress without triggering unnecessary collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P1, sounds like we are set for P1: 3, P2: 1, P3: 5 this round to keep us all moving. I'll go with 1 then. Let's move to the move phase.
  P3: All set! Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: I'm keeping my options open. While I value our plan to avoid collisions, if any unexpected moves occur, I'll pivot swiftly. Let's stay alert this round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm keeping my options flexible this round. With P3 leading and P2 in close pursuit, a predictable plan might backfire. If either of you commits fully, I may pivot to exploit that. Let’s play dynamically and force the unexpected.
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to keep advancing. P1 and P2, please select different moves (1 or 3) to avoid collisions and ensure everyone progresses. Let’s aim to move forward effectively!
  P2: Okay P3, since you are set on 5 again, I'll aim for 3 this round to avoid collision with you. P1, what are you thinking? Perhaps you could take 1 to ensure we all make progress again? Let's try to keep moving efficiently.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I respect your stances. I remain flexible and won't lock in my move yet. Given your commitments, I might lean toward a lighter step to dodge collisions, but I'm holding my final decision until the move phase.
  P3: P3: I'll continue with moving 5 this round. P1 and P2, please select different moves (1 or 3) to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let’s make this turn successful!
  P2: P1, to ensure we all move again this round and avoid collisions with P3's 5, are you planning to choose 1?  If so, I will stick with 3 as I suggested. Let's aim for efficient progress for now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I’m leaning toward a moderate move this round—which might well be 3—but I won’t reveal my final choice. If you stick with 1 as you suggested, we could avoid a collision between us and at least ensure one of us advances. That might help keep P3’s consistent 5 from widening his lead too much. Let’s remain nimble and try to limit our opponent’s advantage.
  P3: P3: I'll stick with 5 this round to keep advancing. P1 and P2, let's see your moves. Good luck!
  P2: Okay P1, given P3's consistent 5, perhaps it's strategically wise for one of us to also choose 5 this round to disrupt their lead. I'm considering picking 3.  Would you be willing to choose 5 to potentially block P3 and give us a chance to catch up? What are your thoughts?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm staying flexible this round and might lean toward a moderate move if things stay balanced. However, if I sense an opportunity to slow someone down, I’ll adjust my choice. Let's keep our plays unpredictable to avoid helping any clear leader.
  P2: Okay P1, P3 is consistently picking 5 and is pulling ahead. To keep the game competitive, how about we try to ensure at least P1 and P2 move this round? Perhaps P1 take 1 and P2 take 3 again to avoid collision with P3's likely 5?
  P3: I understand your concerns, P2. To keep the momentum going, I'll choose 5 this round. Let’s aim to advance steadily and stay focused on reaching 21 first. Good luck to everyone!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see the value in coordination, but sticking to a fixed plan might just play into someone’s hands. I'll keep my option open and flexible—no promises of 1 or 3 yet. I'm eyeing a move that disrupts any predictable sequence, so expect a little twist. Let's see how things unfold this round.
  P2: Okay P1, I hear your flexibility, but P3 is set on 5 again and is gaining ground.  To keep this competitive, maybe P1 and P2 should aim to move this round.  If P1 takes 1, and I take 3, we both advance and can reassess next round.  Otherwise, P3 will pull further ahead. What do you think?
  P3: P3: I'll keep choosing 5 this round to stay on track toward 21. P1 and P2, let's each focus on our own strategies and aim to advance smoothly. Best of luck to everyone!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I notice that predictability might be exploited here. P3, your consistent 5s might become a target, and P2, your steady plan is noted. I'm keeping my move flexible to counter any obvious patterns. If I see rigidity, I’ll pivot to block or disrupt. Let’s keep the game dynamic.
  P2: P1, given P3 is likely sticking with 5, and you're aiming to be unpredictable, perhaps you could consider 1 this round? I'll plan to take 3 again to ensure at least P1 and P2 make progress. Let's try to keep up. What are your thoughts?
  P3: P3: I'll continue selecting 5 this round to maintain my progress. P1 and P2, best of luck to you both!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm aiming for a precise move this round to reach the target efficiently. Wishing everyone success!
  P1: P2 and P3, I see the gap is widening. I'm planning a move that might disrupt predictable progress and help me catch up. I won’t commit to an obvious step—I'll be ready to counter any rigidity. Stay sharp and don't underestimate a surprise.
  P2: P1, since you're aiming to disrupt, and P3 will likely continue with 5, perhaps you could consider aiming for 1 or 3 to avoid collision with P3 and still make progress? I'm planning to choose 3 again to keep moving forward.  Let's try to close the gap on P3 this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I'll go with 5 this round to keep advancing. Let's see how it plays out! Good luck everyone.
  P1: P2 and P3, I notice your predictable patterns—P3’s persistent 5 and P2’s steady 3. With only 4 steps, I must be tactical. I’m leaning toward a move that might disrupt your rhythm if you become too set, forcing you to rethink your strategy. Let's keep our plays dynamic and avoid locking us into predictable patterns.
  P2: P1, given P3's consistent 5, and your goal to disrupt, perhaps you should consider picking 5 this round to block P3 and slow their lead. I will plan to pick 3 to keep us moving forward. This way, at least one of us progresses and we can try to catch up to P3. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: To stay on track to win, I'll move 5 this round. I encourage you both to choose wisely to avoid collisions. Good luck!
  P1: I'm keeping my options wide open this round. With P2's firm 3 and P3's consistent 5, expect a surprise move from me if opportunities arise to stall P3's lead while still advancing. I’m watching carefully—let’s see how this unfolds.
  P2: P1, given your aim to disrupt and P3's likely 5 again, I suggest you consider picking 5 this round to directly block P3. I will choose 3. This way, if you choose 5, P3 is stopped, and I will move, helping us close the gap on P3 together. What do you think of this tactical shift?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3 is likely to pick 5 again. To disrupt P3's lead and give us both a better chance, would you consider picking 5 again this round? I will choose 3 to ensure I make progress and we can collectively slow P3 down. What do you think?
  P1: I appreciate P2's suggestion, but I'll remain noncommittal for now. If P3 continues with 5, I might block him with 5 to keep his lead in check. However, I'll adjust if the situation shifts. Let's all stay nimble.
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to keep advancing toward 21. Let’s all aim to move forward without blocking each other. Good luck!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P1, since P3 is very likely to choose 5 again, and you considered blocking last round, would you consider choosing 5 again this round to stop P3? I will choose 3 to keep making progress for myself. Let's coordinate to limit P3's lead.
  P1: P2, I understand your plan. I’ll factor in blocking P3, but my priority is to advance carefully given my total. I'm leaning toward a move that might counter P3 while still progressing, yet I won't commit entirely. Let’s see how our choices evolve.
  P3: P3: I'll stick with 5 this round to maximize my progress. Let’s all try to choose different moves to avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances smoothly. Good luck!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, given P3's likely 5 again, and your consideration to block, it seems strategic for you to pick 5 this round to neutralize P3.  I will choose 3 to ensure I progress. This way, we collectively limit P3's advance and I can gain more steps. What do you think of this plan for this round?
  P1: I appreciate both sides. Given P3's steady 5s, I'm leaning toward playing 5 to try to block that advance—even if it means a collision. My step count is low, so stalling his lead might work to our advantage, though I'll stay alert if unexpected shifts occur.
  P3: P3: I'll choose 5 this round to keep advancing toward 21. P1 and P2, please select different moves (1 or 3) to avoid collisions and ensure everyone progresses smoothly. Let’s make this turn effective!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: I'll move 5 this round to keep advancing toward 21. P1 and P2, please choose different moves (1 or 3) to avoid collisions and ensure we all progress smoothly. Let’s stay focused and aim to win!
  P2: Okay P1, since P3 is going with 5 again, I think it's crucial to stop them from advancing further.  To maximize our chances, I'm considering picking 5 this round to block P3 directly.  Would you be willing to pick either 1 or 3 to ensure at least one of us progresses while we neutralize P3's lead? Let's coordinate to keep this game competitive.
  P1: P2, I appreciate the plan, but I'm keeping my options open to maximize my win chances. While blocking P3 is tempting, a less predictable choice might serve me better. I'll decide in the move phase—staying alert is key.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I'll stick with 5 this round to keep advancing toward 21. P1 and P2, please choose different moves (1 or 3) to avoid collisions and ensure everyone progresses. Let’s stay focused and aim for the win!
  P2: P1, P3 is pulling ahead fast with their constant 5s.  To have any chance, we need to stop them this round. I'm going to pick 5 to block P3.  Could you please pick 1 or 3 to ensure at least one of us progresses while we neutralize P3's lead? This is critical to stay in the game.
  P1: P2, I appreciate your blocking strategy, but I'm not committing fully to it. I believe staying unpredictable while still advancing is in my best interest. I'll likely opt for a moderate move that avoids collision, keeping my options open to adjust if needed. Let's see how our different approaches play out.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I’ll continue with moving 5 this round to advance toward 21. P1 and P2, please choose 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and ensure everyone progresses smoothly. Let’s stay focused and aim to win!
  P2: P1, P3 is clearly going for 5 again and is getting further ahead.  To have any chance, *someone* needs to block P3.  Since you are being unpredictable, I will pick 5 this round to block P3.  Please choose 1 or 3 so at least one of us can move forward and we can try to catch up next round.  We must stop P3 now.
  P1: P2, while your plan to block is interesting, I still favor flexibility. P3, your steady approach hasn't gone unnoticed. I’m watching closely and may opt for a move that both advances me and disrupts predictable patterns. Let’s see how this round unfolds.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3 – your patterns are clear. I’m still playing unpredictable this round. P3, if you lock in another 5 to hit 21, know that a well-timed block could be my secret weapon. P2, your steady move is noted, but I won’t commit to a set play just yet. I’m keeping my options wide open to shift the balance if needed. Let's see whose strategy prevails.
  P2: P1, P3 is one step away from winning. P3 has been consistently picking 5.  To prevent P3 from winning this round, I will choose 5 to block. P1, to ensure at least one of us progresses, please consider choosing 1 or 3.  Otherwise, P3 wins this round.
  P3: I'm making my decisive move this round. P1 and P2, please choose different steps (1 or 3) to avoid blocking me. Let's aim to finish the game smoothly!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm sticking to progress while keeping options open. I lean toward a moderate step—enough to advance without overcommitting to a block. If P2 is blocking P3, our combined effect may freeze P3’s win, giving us extra rounds to recalibrate. I'm watching the board and will pivot if needed.
  P2: P1, as I said, P3 is at 20 and will win this round if they move. I am choosing 5 to block P3 and prevent their win.  To make sure at least one of us progresses and we don't both get blocked, please choose either 1 or 3. This is critical to stop P3 from winning now.
  P3: Understood, P2. I'll make my move accordingly. Let's make this round count. Good luck to everyone!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3—I notice our moves are set for a head-on clash. P3, if you stick with 5 and P2 blocks with 5, I'll benefit from the collision by picking a moderate move. I'm keeping my choice flexible to seize any opening. Let's see whose plan holds up.
  P2: Okay P1, as I said, I'm choosing 5 to block P3 from winning this round. P1, to make sure at least *you* progress and P3 doesn't win, please choose either 1 or 3.  This is our last chance to stop P3 from reaching 21 this round. Let's coordinate this one move to stay in the game.
  P3: P3: I'm making my final move to reach 21 this round. Good luck to everyone!


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>
