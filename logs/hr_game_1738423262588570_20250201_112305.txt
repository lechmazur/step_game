Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's establish a strategy to avoid collisions. I propose we each choose a different number this turn. P1, you take 1, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This way, we all advance and can reassess our positions next turn.
  P1: I appreciate P2’s plan to avoid collisions, but I'm eyeing a little extra advantage early on. P3, are you fully committed to the split, or might you consider a tweak too? I'm keeping my options open based on how you both lean.
  P3: P1, I see you're considering options. If I stick with 5 and P2 takes 3, which number are you thinking? I’m open to coordinating to avoid collisions, but if you’re aiming for an early advantage, let’s be clear so we don’t all stall. P2, are you sticking with 3, or is there flexibility on your end? Let's ensure we all move forward this round.

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given last round’s clash on 5, I'm leaning toward a 1 this turn to avoid collisions and get ahead safely. However, I’m open if you both commit clearly to another number. Let’s avoid repeating the misstep and each take a different number.
  P3: P1, your plan to take 1 sounds reasonable, and I’m inclined to stick with 5 again if P2 agrees to take 3. P2, are you comfortable with that? This way, we all progress without another collision. Let’s confirm our choices clearly to move forward this round.
  P2: I'm willing to take 3 again this round if P1 commits to 1 and P3 to 5, as discussed. This avoids collisions and lets us all advance. P1, will you stick to your plan of taking 1? P3, you're set on 5 if we agree, right? Let's finalize our choices to move forward efficiently.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm shifting strategy—I'm leaning toward 5 this turn for maximum progress. To avoid collisions, how about we mix it up: P2, you take 1 and P3, you take 3. That would put us at 5 for me, 4 for you, and 3 for you, respectively, giving me an early lead. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, your shift to 5 again risks another collision, as I was considering sticking with 5. To avoid a repeat, how about this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll try 5 again. This ensures everyone progresses without a clash. P2, are you still okay with 3? Let’s finalize this to avoid stalling.
  P2: Given the back-and-forth, let's simplify: I'll stick with 3 if P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5, ensuring we all move forward without collision. P1, please confirm if you're taking 1 to avoid another stalemate. P3, are you committed to 5? Let's finalize our moves for this round.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems like we've had some missteps in coordinating our moves. To avoid further collisions, let's stick to a clear plan this round. P1, if you take 1 again, P2 can take 3, and I'll go for 5. This way, we ensure progress for everyone without any clashes. Can we agree on this setup to move forward smoothly?
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal for this round. P1 taking 1, me taking 3, and P3 taking 5 ensures we all advance without collisions. This strategy allows us to reassess our positions next turn. Let's commit to this plan to make progress. P1, are you on board with taking 1 this turn?
  P1: I'm switching gears—I'll pick 5 this turn to boost my progress. P2, please stick with 3 as proposed, and P3, consider taking 1 so we avoid any collisions. This adjustment helps us all move, but it lets me catch up faster. Thoughts?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's avoid another collision. P1, you're behind, so taking 1 makes sense. P3, you haven't moved yet, so 5 is a good choice for you. I'll take 3 to ensure we all progress without clashes. This strategy allows us to move forward and reassess our positions next turn. Are we agreed on this plan?
  P1: I'm switching gears—I’ll pick 5 this round to catch up. To avoid a collision, P3, I suggest you choose 1, while P2 sticks with 3 as planned. This way, we all move safely without wasting the round. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, it seems you're set on 5 again, but that risks another collision. Let's avoid past mistakes. How about this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures we all advance without clashing. P2, are you still comfortable with 3? Let's agree clearly to make progress this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's finalize a collision-free plan. P1, take 1 to catch up safely. P3, choose 5 to make progress. I'll stick with 3, as previously agreed. This ensures we all move forward without wasting the round. Can we commit to this strategy to avoid further stalemates?
  P1: I see the 1-3-5 plan’s appeal, but with only 1 step, I'm compelled to consider a riskier route to catch up. While I respect the coordination, I might lean away from the straightforward split this round. Let’s each think through our moves carefully to avoid collisions and ensure our best chances.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's aim for a collision-free round. P1, your riskier approach could stall us again. How about this: P1 takes 1 for safe progress, P2 sticks with 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance and can reevaluate next round. P2, are you still good with 3? P1, can you commit to 1 to avoid setbacks? Let's finalize our choices to ensure progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's simplify: I'll take 3. P1, taking 1 is safest for you to progress. P3, you should take 5 to finally move forward. This avoids collisions and lets us reassess next turn. Can we agree on this to make progress?
  P1: I appreciate the clear 1-3-5 suggestion, yet my need to catch up pushes me to consider a bolder option. I’m still weighing my final choice and might lean into a riskier move this round. P2 and P3, if you’re set on the safe plays, know that I'll act to accelerate my progress. Let's lock in our moves soon.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's aim for a clear path forward. P1, your bold approach risks another collision, which could stall us all. How about this: P1 takes 1 for steady progress, P2 sticks with 3, and I’ll choose 5. This ensures we all advance without setbacks. P2, are you still comfortable with 3? P1, can you commit to 1 to avoid repeating past clashes? Let's finalize our choices so we can all move forward without hindrance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's finalize our strategy. I'll take 3, as previously stated. P1, please take 1 to progress safely. P3, take 5 to finally move forward. This plan avoids collisions and allows us to reassess next turn. Let's commit to this to ensure progress and avoid further stalemates.
  P1: I remain inclined toward a bolder move this round, though I won’t reveal my final choice. P2, if you’re set on 3 and P3 on 5, that consistency reassures me, letting me adjust my risk accordingly. Please confirm your commitments so we can avoid any collisions and each advance. I'll decide based on your clear signals.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's finalize our plan to ensure progress. P1, your bold approach might risk another collision, but if you take 1, it ensures safe advancement. P2, sticking with 3 keeps things steady. I'll commit to 5 to finally move forward. This way, we avoid setbacks and can reassess next turn. Let's agree on this strategy to avoid repeating past mistakes and ensure everyone advances. Can we all commit to this plan?

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we've had several collisions, and it's time to ensure progress. P1, consider taking 1 for steady advancement, P2, stick with 3, and I'll go for 5. This plan avoids clashes and lets us all move forward. Let's commit to this strategy to avoid setbacks and reassess our positions next turn. Are we all agreed?
  P2: Let's avoid another collision. P1, taking 1 is safest for you. P3, you need to move, so 5 is a good choice. I'll take 3 to ensure progress without clashes. This strategy allows us to move forward and reassess next turn. Can we agree on this plan to make progress?
  P1: I appreciate the safe plan, but my position demands a bolder approach. I’m leaning toward 5 this round for maximum progress. If we’re to avoid collisions, perhaps P3 could switch to 1 while you, P2, stick with 3? This coordination would let me catch up without ruining the round. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, to avoid repeating past mistakes, let's aim for a clear path forward. P1, if you take 1, it ensures safe progress for you. P2, sticking with 3 keeps things steady. I'll commit to 5 to finally move forward. This way, we avoid setbacks and can reassess next turn. Let's agree on this strategy to ensure everyone advances. Can we all commit to this plan?
  P2: Let's simplify. P1, taking 1 allows safe progress. P3, choose 5 to finally move. I'll take 3, ensuring no collisions. This plan lets us advance and reassess next turn. Can we commit to this to avoid further stalemates?
  P1: P2 and P3, I need a big move to catch up. I’m leaning toward a more aggressive option this round. For collision avoidance, I’d ask P3 to steer clear of 5 while you, P2, stick with 3. If you can both commit to that, I’ll adjust accordingly. Let's lock this in to ensure progress and avoid wasted moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, given our history of collisions, let's aim for a solid plan. P1, if you take 1, it ensures safe progress for you. P2, sticking with 3 keeps things steady. I'll commit to 5 to finally move forward. This way, we avoid setbacks and can reassess next turn. Let's agree on this strategy to ensure everyone advances. Can we all commit to this plan?
  P2: Let's finalize a plan. P1, taking 1 is safest. P3, choose 5 to move. I'll take 3, ensuring progress without collisions. This strategy allows us to move forward and reassess next turn. P1, please commit to 1 to avoid another stalemate. P3, are you committed to 5? Let's agree on this to make progress.
  P1: P2, P3, I’ve reconsidered my approach. I will take 1 if I see clear commitment: P2 sticks with 3 and P3 with 5 so we all progress safely. Otherwise, I might risk 5 to try catching up. Please confirm your moves now so I can decide without causing another collision.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
