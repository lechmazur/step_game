Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. If we each pick different numbers this turn, we all advance. I propose P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. We can rotate next round. Trust is key to avoid everyone getting stuck.
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal for this round. If we each pick different numbers, we can all make progress. I suggest we stick to P1:5, P2:3, and I’ll take P3:1. This way, we avoid collisions and can move ahead together. Let’s keep this trust going for the next round as well. What do you both think?
  P2: Okay, I agree. P2 will take 3 this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: 
  P3: P1, P2, I’m glad we’re on the same page. Just to confirm, I’ll stick with P3:1 as suggested. If we all follow through with our agreed numbers, we’ll make solid progress. Let’s keep the trust and coordinate again for the next round. I’m looking forward to seeing how we all advance this turn. What do you both think about sticking to the plan?
  P2: Sounds good P1 and P3. Let's all lock in our agreed moves of P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 for this round to get us all moving.

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, round 2. To keep the coordination going, how about we rotate the numbers we pick?  For this round, how about P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and P1 picks 1? This way we all keep progressing and share the bigger steps. What do you both think?
  P3: I appreciate the idea of rotating our moves, P2. However, I suggest we consider a different rotation to avoid potential collisions. How about P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1? This way, we can maintain our trust and ensure we all advance without overlapping. Let’s discuss this further to see if we can reach an agreement. What do you both think?
  P1: Let’s adopt P3’s rotation: **P1:3, P2:1, P3:5** this round. Next round, we can cycle again to ensure fairness (e.g., P2:5, P3:3, P1:1). Trust ensures we all advance. If we collide, no one progresses. Solidarity benefits everyone.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good, P3 and P1. Let's lock in P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 for this round as agreed.  For round 3, we can discuss the next rotation then.
  P3: I agree with the plan to rotate our moves for this round: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This approach should help us avoid collisions and keep everyone moving forward. For the next round, we can discuss another rotation to maintain our progress. It’s important that we stick to our agreements to ensure we all benefit. Let’s keep the trust going! What do you both think?
  P1: Agreed. Let’s stick to **P1:3, P2:1, P3:5** this round. Consistency builds trust. Next round, we can rotate to **P1:1, P2:5, P3:3**, ensuring fairness. This cycle allows steady progress for all without collisions. Solidarity keeps us advancing.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, confirming again P2 is choosing 1 for this round as agreed. Let's all lock in our moves now to keep progressing.

Afterward, we can discuss the next rotation to maintain our progress. It's crucial we stick to our agreements to avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances. Looking forward to seeing how we all do this turn! What do you both think?

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Continuing our agreed rotation: **P1:1, P2:5, P3:3** this round. Next round, let's rotate to **P1:5, P2:3, P3:1** to spread our steps and prevent clustering. This ensures steady progress for all. Trust and consistency are key. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with continuing the rotation. However, I suggest we reconsider the next round after this one. For this round, I'm locked in for **P3:3** as agreed. For the next move, I think we should prioritize avoiding collisions to ensure we all progress further. Perhaps we can discuss a different rotation that maximizes our steps without overlapping. Let’s stay focused on moving forward together! What do you both think?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, sounds good. P2 is locked in for 5 this round as planned. Let's keep this rotation going for now and we can chat about future rounds after this one.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Confirming **P1:1, P2:5, P3:3** this round. Trust ensures we all advance. Let’s stick to the rotation, then discuss future rounds. Solidarity keeps us moving.
  P3: I appreciate the commitment to our current rotation, P1 and P2. However, I believe we should consider adjusting our strategy for the next round to maximize our individual progress. After this round, let’s discuss a rotation that allows us to take larger steps without colliding. It’s crucial we keep moving forward, and I want us all to benefit. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this! What do you both think about revisiting our strategy after this round?
  P2: Okay P3, sounds good to discuss round 4 strategy after this round. For now, let's lock in P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 as we've agreed for this round to keep us all moving.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **Confirmation and Plan for Next Round**
- **Round 3:** P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 (as agreed).  
- **Round 4 Proposal:** Rotate back to **P1:5, P2:3, P3:1** for maximum steps without collision.  
- **Goal:** Preserve trust and momentum. Consistency ensures shared progress.  

**Why This Works:**  
1. **No Collisions:** Unique moves guarantee advancement.  
2. **Fair Rotation:** Equal access to larger steps over time.  
3. **Speed to 21:** Steady gains for all, but P1 gains +5 next round, accelerating toward victory.  

**Key Phrase:** *"Stick to the cycle—trust breeds success."*
  P3: I appreciate the commitment to our current moves, P1 and P2. Just to confirm, I’m locked in for P3:3 this round. After this round, I suggest we consider a different rotation that maximizes our steps without overlapping. For the next round, we could try **P1:5, P2:1, P3:3**. This way, I can catch up while still allowing everyone to progress. Let’s keep the trust and strategy going! What do you both think?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, confirming P2 is choosing 5 for this round as we agreed. For round 4, I think P1's suggestion of P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 sounds good to keep the rotation and progress going. Let's plan to stick with that for next round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: **Round 4 Plan Confirmation:**  
- **Stick to rotation: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1** as agreed.  
- **Why:** Avoid collisions, maintain trust, and maximize *collective* progress. Deviating risks stalling everyone.  
- **Next:** Cycle ensures fairness (5s rotate). Let’s lock this in. Trust keeps us advancing. **Agreed?**
  P3: I appreciate the commitment we've shown so far, P1 and P2. Just to reiterate, I’m locked in for P3:3 this round. After this, let’s ensure we stick to our plan for round 4: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This rotation will help us all advance without collisions. It’s crucial we maintain our trust and strategy to keep progressing together. Looking forward to seeing how we all do this turn! What do you both think about confirming our moves?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, confirming P2 is choosing 5 for this round, and P2 agrees to stick with the rotation of P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 for round 4 as planned. Let's all lock in our moves for this round.

  P3: I appreciate the commitment to our agreed plan, P1 and P2. Just to confirm, I’m locked in for P3:1 this round. After this, we should discuss our next moves to ensure we all continue to progress without collisions. It's important to maintain our trust and strategy to keep moving forward together. Let’s see how we all do this turn! What do you both think about confirming our moves now?
  P1: **Final Confirmation:**  
Stick to **P1:5, P2:3, P3:1** as agreed. Last round’s collision hurt us all. Trust is critical—let’s avoid repeats. P1 locked in for 5. Confirm P2 and P3’s commitments now. Solidarity ensures progress.

Let’s see how we all do this turn! What are your thoughts on confirming our moves now?
  P1: **Final Plea:**  
P3, last round you collided with P2 by picking 5. If you deviate again, *no one* benefits. Stick to **P3:1** now. P1:5, P2:3. Trust or we all lose. Confirm.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, P2 is still choosing 3 as agreed. Let's make sure we all stick to the plan this round to actually progress.  Trust is important, let's show we can do it.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's stay committed to our agreed moves this round: **P1:5, P2:3, P3:1**. It's crucial we avoid any collisions to ensure everyone advances. Trust is essential for our progress. If we stick to the plan, we can all move forward effectively. After this round, we can discuss our strategy moving forward, but for now, let’s lock in our moves and make sure we all benefit. What do you both think?
  P1: **Final Warning:** P3, deviating again risks mutual annihilation. P1:5, P2:3, **P3:1** is our only path. Collisions trap us all. Trust now or chaos follows. Confirm your commitment.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1's Message:**  
"P3’s repeated 5s sabotage us all. P2, let’s abandon the broken rotation. I’ll take 3, you take 5. If P3 takes 1, we all advance. If P3 takes 5, you stall but I move. If P3 takes 3, I stall but you move. Either way, one advances. Solidarity now or mutual loss."
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the concerns about my previous moves. However, I believe we can still work together. I suggest we follow P1's plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I will take 1. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances. Trust is crucial, and I’m committed to making this work. Let’s lock in our moves for this round and keep the momentum going. What do you both think?
  P2: Okay P1, I agree to your plan for this round: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. Let's try this new approach to ensure at least some progress this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1's Strategic Proposal:**  
- **Round 6:** P1:3, P2:5, P3:1.  
- **Why:** If P3 complies, *all advance*. If P3 defects, P2 stalls but P1 moves. Avoid total stagnation.  
- **Urgency:** We’re tied at 12. This plan ensures *at least one* of us gains. Trust now or risk mutual loss. **Agreed?**
  P2: Okay P1, I agree with your proposal for this round: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. It seems like a smart move to ensure at least some progress. Let's stick to this plan and hope P3 will cooperate this time so we can all advance.

  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1's Strategic Offer to P2:**  
P2, you’re at 17. Take **3** this round (→20), then **1** next turn to win. I’ll take **5** now (→20) and commit to **1** next round. P3:1 now (→9). This guarantees *your* victory next round. Colliding now (if I mirror your 5) helps no one. **Trust secures your win.** Confirm?
  P2: Okay P1, your plan sounds good to me. P2 will take 3 this round, aiming for 20 steps.  Let's do P2:3, P1:5, P3:1 as you suggested to get us all moving this round. P2 confirms to take 1 next round to win if we all progress this round as planned. P3, please take 1 this round.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your strategy. I will stick to **P3:1** this round to ensure we avoid collisions and allow P2 to reach 20. If P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 3, we can all make progress.

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1:** P2, mutual 5s doom us. Let’s lock **P1:5, P2:3, P3:1**. You reach 23 (respectable), I win. Collision = mutual loss. Trust our alliance. P3, take 1 to avoid stalling. Final chance for rational play. **Confirm now.**
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the importance of avoiding collisions. I agree to stick with **P3:1** this round to ensure we all make progress. If we follow the plan of **P1:5, P2:3, P3:1**, we can prevent mutual loss and allow both of you to advance. Trust is key, and I’m committed to this strategy. Let’s lock in our moves and make sure we all benefit this round! Please confirm your commitments so we can proceed effectively.
  P2: Okay P1, actually for P2 to win this round, P2 needs to choose 1. How about we change the plan to P1:3, P2:1, P3:5? This way P2 wins and P1 still progresses nicely. What do you think? P3, does P3:5 work for you?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1:** P2, your plan secures your win. I counter: **If you take 1, I mirror → mutual stall. Take 3 → you finish at 23 (I win). Take 5 → we tie. Choose: tie or lose. P3, stay at 1. No more tricks.**
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the importance of this round. However, I believe we should stick to the original plan of **P1:5, P2:3, P3:1**. This ensures both of you advance, and I avoid stalling. If we all commit to this, we can prevent any collisions and maximize our progress. Trust is essential for our success, and I’m ready to follow through. Let’s lock in our moves and make this round work for everyone! What do you both think?
  P2: P1, I understand your point, but P2 needs to choose 1 to win *this round*.  P2 will choose 1 now to try to secure the win. P1, if you want to move, please choose 3 or 5. P3, please choose 5 to avoid collision and ensure you also progress. Let's make this round decisive.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1 to P2:**  
Take 1: I take 5 (25) → I win. Take 5: tie. Choose.  
**To P3:** Stick to 1. Collisions ruin all. Final warning: **P1:5 locked.**
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the urgency in this round. However, I believe we should stick to the plan of **P1:5, P2:3, P3:1**. This ensures both of you advance while I avoid stalling. If P2 chooses 1, it puts you at risk of losing. Trust is essential for our success, and I’m committed to this strategy. Let’s finalize our moves and make sure we all benefit this round. Please confirm your commitments!
  P2: P1, I am choosing 1 to win now.  If you choose 5, you will also move and we both progress.  If you try to block me by choosing 1, we both stall, which helps neither of us and risks letting P3 catch up. Let's both move forward this round. P3, please choose 5 to avoid collision and ensure you also progress.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: **P1's Final Logic:**  
- **P2 takes 1:** You reach 21, but P1 takes 5 (25 → **wins**).  
- **P2 takes 5:** Collision → both stall. **P3 gains nothing.**  
- **P2 takes 3:** P1 takes 5 (25 → **wins**).  

**P1:5 locked.** Rational choice: avoid collision. **Confirm moves now.**
