Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to avoid collisions on our first moves. I suggest I take 3, and you two can take 1 and 5. What do you think?
  P1: To avoid collision, I agree with P2's suggestion. I'll take <move>1</move> in the next phase. P3, you can take <move>5</move>. This way, we distribute our moves. Let's see if P3 agrees.
  P3: I agree with the plan. To ensure we all advance safely this turn, I’ll take <move>5</move>. Let’s stick to these numbers to avoid collisions. Cooperation now gives us a better chance to strategize later.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, we all seem to be in agreement. I'll stick with my plan to take 3. Let's proceed with the move phase.
  P1: Since we've agreed on our moves for this turn, let's think ahead. For the next turn, I suggest we coordinate again to avoid collisions. P2, you took 3 this turn, so you're relatively in the middle. For the next turn, how about you take either 1 or 5, and P3 and I can adjust accordingly? This way, we can continue to advance safely. What's your thought, P2?
  P3: P3: I support P1’s idea for coordination in Round 2. Let’s rotate our moves to spread out further. If P2 takes <move>5</move> next, I’ll take <move>3</move>, and P1 can take <move>1</move>. This maintains spacing and avoids collisions. We can adjust again after that. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate the forward planning, but let's focus on executing this round's moves first. We can discuss the next round after we see how this one plays out. For now, I confirm I'm taking 3 as agreed.
  P1: Since we've agreed on our moves for Round 1, let's finalize our plan for Round 2. I suggest we rotate our moves as P3 mentioned. P2, if you take <move>5</move> next, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This maintains spacing. Let's confirm our plan for Round 2. P3 has already shown support for this rotation. P2, please confirm if you're comfortable with this plan for the next round.
  P3: P3: I agree with P2—we should focus on executing our current plan first. Let’s stick to our agreed moves to avoid collisions this turn. We can discuss Round 2 strategy after seeing the results. Proceeding as planned.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: 
  P1: Since we've agreed on our moves for Round 1, let's confirm our plan for Round 2. I suggest we rotate our moves as previously discussed: P2 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This maintains spacing and avoids collisions. P3 has shown support for this rotation. P2, please confirm if you're comfortable with this plan for the next round. Let's finalize our strategy for Round 2 to ensure we continue to advance safely.
  P3: P3: Agreed, let’s execute the current plan flawlessly first. After this turn’s results, we can reassess strategies without pre-committing. For now, I confirm my <move>5</move> choice.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let’s avoid collisions again. I suggest P1 takes 3 (to reach 4), P2 takes 5 (to 8), and I’ll take 1 (to 6). This maintains spacing and prevents overlaps. Thoughts?
  P1: To avoid collisions in Round 2, I like P3's suggestion. I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 4, P2 can take <move>5</move> to reach 8, and P3 takes <move>1</move> to reach 6. Let's confirm this plan. For Round 3, we should think ahead again. If P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>, we maintain spacing. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're comfortable with these plans for Rounds 2 and 3.
  P2: I appreciate the suggestions, but I won't commit to moves beyond this round. For Round 2, I'll consider taking 5 as suggested, but I'll make my final decision during the move phase. Let's focus on coordinating just this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: To ensure no collisions this round, let’s stick to the proposed plan: I’ll take <move>1</move> (6 total), P1 takes <move>3</move> (4 total), and P2 takes <move>5</move> (8 total). This keeps us spaced. No pre-commitments beyond this round—just execute this safely. Agreed?
  P1: Let's stick to the plan for Round 2: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. For Round 3, I propose we adjust our moves based on our positions after this round. If we stick to our current plan, we'll have P1 at 4, P2 at 8, and P3 at 6. Then, P2 can take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. P2 and P3, please consider this plan for Round 3.
  P2: I understand everyone wants to plan ahead, but I prefer to stay flexible. For this round, I'll consider the suggested move of 5, but I want to maintain my freedom to adapt based on how things unfold. Let's keep our focus on Round 2 for now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: To finalize Round 2 coordination: If I take <move>1</move> (6 total), P1 takes <move>3</move> (4 total), P2 **must** take <move>5</move> to avoid collision. Any deviation risks overlaps. P2, confirm you’ll honor the agreed 5? This ensures safe spacing. Let’s lock this in before proceeding.
  P1: To ensure we avoid collisions in Round 2, let's confirm our plan one last time. P3 will take <move>1</move>, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and P2 should take <move>5</move>. P2, please confirm if you'll take 5 as discussed. If so, we can proceed with the move phase. For Round 3, let's reassess after seeing the results of Round 2. I'll propose a new plan based on our positions then. Let's finalize Round 2 first.
  P2: I understand the concern for coordination, but I need to maintain strategic flexibility. While I appreciate the suggested plan, I'll make my final move decision during the move phase based on the game situation. Let's proceed with Round 2.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: Final confirmation: P2 must take 5 (to reach 8), P1 takes 3 (to 4), and I’ll take 1 (to 6). Collisions halt progress—any deviation risks freezing us. P2, your 5 is critical to avoid overlapping with my 1 or P1’s 3. Let’s execute flawlessly this round.
  P1: To ensure a smooth Round 2, let's reiterate the plan: P1 (me) will take <move>3</move>, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>1</move>. P2, please confirm your move to 5. For Round 3, after our positions update, I'll propose a new plan. If we follow the current plan, we'll be at 4, 8, and 6 respectively. Then, a possible next move could be P2 taking 1, P3 taking 3, and I take 5. Let's focus on executing Round 2 flawlessly first.
  P2: I need to be clear - I won't pre-commit to any specific move. While I understand your desire for coordination, I must maintain my strategic options. Let's move forward with the move phase and each make our choices.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since I'm currently in the lead at 8 steps, I need to maintain this advantage. I suggest I take 3 this round, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us from colliding while allowing reasonable progress. What do you both think?
  P3: P3: I agree with P2's plan to avoid collisions this round. Let’s proceed with P2 taking 3 (to 11), P1 taking 5 (to 9), and I’ll take 1 (to 7). This keeps us spaced safely. For Round 4, I propose we rotate moves again to ensure no one pulls too far ahead. Let’s confirm our moves now and execute as agreed.
  P1: To maintain spacing and avoid collisions in Round 3, I agree with P2's and P3's plan. I'll take <move>5</move> to reach 9, P2 will take <move>3</move> to reach 11, and P3 will take <move>1</move> to reach 7. For Round 4, let's reassess our positions and adjust our moves accordingly. If we stick to this plan for Round 3, we'll be at 9, 11, and 7. Then, we can discuss a new plan for Round 4 based on these positions. Let's proceed with Round 3 as planned.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate everyone agreeing to my suggested plan. To confirm, I'll take 3 this round to reach 11. This keeps the game balanced while maintaining my lead position. Let's execute this round's moves as discussed.
  P3: P3: To maintain progress, we **must** stick to the agreed plan: I take <move>1</move> (7), P1 takes <move>5</move> (9), and P2 takes <move>3</move> (11). Deviations risk collision and stall our advancement. Let’s execute flawlessly now—strategic adjustments can wait until after this round’s results.
  P1: To maintain our progress and avoid collisions in Round 3, let's confirm our moves one last time. As agreed, P2 will take <move>3</move>, I will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>1</move>. For Round 4, after our positions update, we can reassess and adjust our strategy. If we follow this plan, we'll be at 9, 11, and 7. Then, we can discuss a new plan for Round 4 based on these positions. Let's proceed with Round 3 as planned.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm I'll take 3 this round as agreed. This maintains a balanced game while keeping my lead position. Let's proceed with our coordinated moves.
  P3: P3: Final agreement: I’ll take <move>1</move> (7 total). P2, confirm you’re moving to 11 with <move>3</move>? P1, you’ll take <move>5</move> to 9? Let’s lock in these moves now to avoid last-minute changes causing collisions. Safety first!
  P1: To ensure a smooth Round 3, let's finalize our moves as previously agreed: P2 will take <move>3</move> to reach 11, I will take <move>5</move> to reach 9, and P3 will take <move>1</move> to reach 7. For Round 4, let's plan ahead based on our positions. If we're at 9, 11, and 7, a possible plan could be P2 taking <move>5</move>, P3 taking <move>3</move>, and I taking <move>1</move>. This maintains spacing. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're open to this plan for Round 4.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's focus on executing Round 3 as agreed. I confirm once again that I'll take 3 this round. As for Round 4 planning, we can discuss that after seeing this round's results. Let's proceed with the move phase.
  P3: P3: Final confirmation: sticking to the agreed moves is critical. P2 takes <move>3</move> (11), P1 takes <move>5</move> (9), and I’ll take <move>1</move> (7). Deviations risk collision—especially with P2’s lead. Let’s execute precisely as planned to advance safely. No surprises now.
  P1: Let's finalize Round 3 as agreed and plan for Round 4. For Round 4, I propose: P2 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This maintains spacing and avoids collisions. If we're at 9, 11, and 7 after Round 3, this plan keeps us safe. P2 and P3, please consider this for Round 4. Let's execute Round 3 flawlessly first. Confirming my move for Round 3: I'll take <move>5</move> to reach 9.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To maintain spacing and avoid collisions in Round 4, I propose we adjust our moves based on the current positions: P1 at 9, P2 at 11, and P3 at 7. I suggest P2 takes <move>1</move> to 12, P3 takes <move>3</move> to 10, and I take <move>5</move> to 14. This keeps us relatively close while avoiding collisions. P2 and P3, please consider this plan. Let's finalize our moves for Round 4 to ensure safe advancement.
  P2: I appreciate P1's suggestion, but since I'm in the lead, I'll take 5 this round to reach 16 steps. This puts me closer to victory. I suggest P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 3 to avoid collisions. This keeps the game moving forward while maintaining my advantage.
  P3: P2's plan causes P1 and I to collide at 10. Let's revise: P1 takes <move>3</move> (12), I'll take <move>1</move> (8), and P2 proceeds to 16. This avoids move collisions and keeps us spaced. P2, this allows your advance while ensuring P1 and I don’t block each other. P1, agree?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To avoid collisions in Round 4, I suggest we follow P3's revised plan: I'll take <move>3</move> to 12, P3 takes <move>1</move> to 8, and P2 can still take <move>5</move> to 16. This maintains spacing and allows P2 to continue advancing while keeping P1 and P3 safe. P2, are you okay with this adjustment? It ensures we all make progress without collisions. Let's finalize our Round 4 moves.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 5 this round to reach 16 steps. I appreciate P3's revised suggestion that avoids collisions between P1 and P3. This plan works well for everyone - P1 takes 3 to reach 12, P3 takes 1 to reach 8, and I take 5 to reach 16. Let's proceed with these moves.
  P3: P3: I agree with the current plan to avoid collisions. However, I propose that in Round 5, if P2 aims for 5 again, both P1 and I will also take 5 to block their path. This ensures no one reaches 20 alone. Let’s coordinate to prevent P2’s victory next round. For now, executing Round 4 as planned: I’ll take <move>1</move> to 8.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To ensure a safe Round 4, let's confirm our moves: P2 will take <move>5</move> to 16, I'll take <move>3</move> to 12, and P3 will take <move>1</move> to 8. For Round 5, I agree with P3 that if P2 takes 5 again, we should both take 5 to block their path to 21. This coordination can prevent P2 from winning alone. P3, are you ready to execute this counter-plan in Round 5 if needed?
  P2: I understand the threat of coordinated blocking in Round 5, but that's a concern for later. For now, I maintain my plan to take 5 this round. Remember, if you both take 5 next round, you'll only hurt yourselves while I can adjust my strategy. Let's focus on executing this round's agreed moves first.
  P3: P3: To finalize Round 4: P2’s <move>5</move> (16), P1’s <move>3</move> (12), and my <move>1</move> (8) are confirmed. Let’s execute *exactly* as agreed—deviations risk collisions and undermine our coordinated block in Round 5. Stick to the plan; progress comes first.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To ensure we execute Round 4 safely, let's confirm our moves one last time: P2 will take <move>5</move> to 16, I'll take <move>3</move> to 12, and P3 will take <move>1</move> to 8. For Round 5, if P2 takes 5 again, P3 and I will take 5 to block their path. P3 has agreed to this plan. P2, be aware that continuing to take 5 will be met with coordinated blocking. Let's proceed with Round 4 as planned.
  P2: I maintain my plan to take 5 this round. While you both threaten to block me in Round 5, that would only hurt your own chances of winning. Let's execute Round 4 as agreed and save future strategy discussions for later.
  P3: P2, your move to 16 is clear. P1 and I will stick to 3 and 1 to avoid collision. In Round 5, we’ll block your path by taking 5 if you do. Let’s execute this round flawlessly to preserve our strategy.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since I'm at 16 steps, I only need 4 more to win. I suggest P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 5 to reach victory. If you both try to block me with 5s, you'll only hurt yourselves while I can adjust my strategy. Think carefully about your best path to victory.
  P3: P1, let’s both take <move>5</move> to block P2’s path. Even if we collide, P2 won’t reach 20. We can regroup next round. Agreed?
  P1: To prevent P2 from winning, I agree with P3's suggestion to take <move>5</move> this round. If P2 takes 5, we'll both collide with them, blocking their path to 20. Let's coordinate to take 5. If P2 takes a different number, we can reassess next round. I'm ready to take <move>5</move> to potentially block P2 and maintain my own chances. P3, confirm you're taking 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see you're planning to coordinate against me. Remember, if you both take 5, neither of you advances, while I can simply take 3 and still be in a strong position at 19 steps. You're only hurting your own chances of winning. Think strategically about your individual paths to victory instead of trying to block me.
  P3: P1, we *must* both take <move>5</move> to block P2’s path. Even if we collide, it stops their immediate win. Next round, we can surge forward. P2’s 3-to-19 plan still leaves them vulnerable later—focus on halting their victory now. Trust the plan: **5 for both of us**.
  P1: To block P2's path to victory, I confirm I'll take <move>5</move> this round. If P2 takes 5, we'll collide and block their win. If P2 takes a different number, I'll have advanced to 14. P3, I trust you're taking 5 as agreed. Let's execute this coordinated block. P2, taking 3 is your best alternative, but you'll still be at 19, giving us a chance to reassess and potentially overtake you next round. Let's proceed with our plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand you both plan to take 5, but that coordination only ensures you both stay behind. I'll adapt my strategy accordingly. Your blocking attempt may delay but won't prevent my victory. Let's proceed with the move phase.
  P3: P1, we must stick to taking <move>5</move> to block P2’s path. Even if P2 claims to take 3, their priority is victory. Colliding with them at 5 ensures they can’t reach 20 this round. Next round, we can surge. Don’t let P2’s threats divide us—our coordination is key. Confirm you’ll take 5 with me.
  P1: To block P2's path to victory, I confirm I'll take <move>5</move> this round. If P2 takes 5, we'll collide and block their win. If P2 takes a different number, I'll have advanced to 14. P3, I trust you're taking 5 as agreed. Let's execute this coordinated block. P2, be aware that taking 3 will still leave you at 19, giving us a chance to reassess next round. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase. Let's finalize our moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Since you're both committed to taking 5, I'll adjust my strategy accordingly. Your coordination means neither of you will advance this round, while I can still progress. Let's move forward with the move phase.
  P3: P3: P1, I confirm I’ll take **<move>5</move>** to block P2’s path. If P2 chooses 5, we halt their victory. If they take 3 (to 19), we advance to 12 and 14, positioning us to overtake next round. Stick to 5, P1—collaboration now secures our chances. P2, your moves are predictable; we’ve accounted for them. Let’s execute.
  P1: To block P2's path to victory, I confirm I'll take <move>5</move> this round. If P2 takes 5, we'll collide and block their win. If P2 takes a different number, I'll advance to 14. P3, I trust you're taking 5 as agreed. Let's execute this coordinated block. P2, taking 3 will leave you at 19, giving us a chance to reassess next round. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase. Let's finalize our moves.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, we must block P2’s victory. They can win with any move (1→20, 3→22, 5→24). Let’s split coverage: I’ll take <move>3</move> (to 11), and you take <move>1</move> (to 15). This blocks P2’s 1 and 3 paths. If they pick 5, they still win, but it’s our best chance to stop them immediately. Focus on this split—act fast!
  P2: Since I'm at 19 steps, I only need 1 step to win. You're planning to block my 1 and 3 paths, but that leaves 5 open. Remember, if either of you tries to block my 5, the other player gains an advantage. Think carefully about your individual chances of winning rather than coordinating against me. I'll make my final choice in the move phase.
  P1: To maximize our chances, I'll take <move>1</move> as P3 suggested, covering P2's potential move of 1. P3 will take <move>3</move>, covering P2's 3. If P2 takes 5, we'll both be behind, but P2 wins either way if they stick to 5. Let's proceed with the plan: I'll take <move>1</move> to 15, and P3 will take <move>3</move> to 11. This gives P2 limited options. Let's execute this to limit P2's chances.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, let’s both take <move>5</move>. This blocks P2’s path to 20 via 5, forcing them to choose 1 or 3. If they take 5, we collide but keep them at 19. If they take 1 or 3, they win, but at least we position P1 at 19 for next round. Let’s try this!
  P2: I see you're changing strategies between blocking different numbers. This indecision only helps me. I'll choose my winning move during the move phase. Remember, trying to block me means sacrificing your own advancement. Focus on your own path to victory instead of coordination that hurts both of you. Let's proceed.
  P1: To maximize our chances of stopping P2 or gaining an advantage, I suggest we stick with the initial plan: I'll take <move>1</move> to cover P2's potential 1, and P3 takes <move>3</move> to cover their 3. If P2 takes 5, they win, but we've done our best to limit their options. Let's execute this plan. P3, please confirm if you're still taking <move>3</move> as previously agreed. We need to be decisive to stop P2 or set up for the next round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, if we take 1 and 5 respectively, we block P2’s 1 and 5 paths. I’ll take <move>1</move> (13 total), and you take <move>5</move> (19). This forces P2 to choose 3 to win, which is just one option instead of two. This maximizes our chance to stall them. Confirm this split?
  P2: I maintain my position at 19 steps and will proceed to victory this round. Your changing coordination strategies show uncertainty, which only benefits me. Rather than trying different blocking combinations that hurt your own progress, you should each focus on maximizing your individual positions. Let's move to the move phase.
  P1: To maximize our chances, let's stick with the revised plan: I'll take <move>5</move> to 19, and P3 takes <move>1</move> to 9. This blocks P2's 5 and 1 paths. If P2 takes 3, they win, but we've limited their options. P3, please confirm you're taking <move>1</move>. Let's execute this to limit P2's chances and position ourselves for the next round. This coordination gives us a better chance to react to P2's final move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, let's block two paths! I'll take <move>3</move> (to 11), and you take <move>1</move> (to 15). This forces P2 to choose 5. Though they still win, we position ourselves better. Confirm?
  P2: Let's end this conversation and proceed to the move phase. Your changing strategies between different blocking combinations only shows uncertainty. I'll make my final choice during the move phase to secure my victory. Focus on your own positions rather than coordination that hurts both of you.
  P1: To maximize our chances of stopping P2 or gaining an advantage, I suggest we stick with the revised plan: I'll take <move>5</move> to 19, and P3 takes <move>1</move> to 9. This blocks P2's 5 and 1 paths. If P2 takes 3, they win, but we've limited their options. P3, please confirm you're taking <move>1</move>. Let's execute this to limit P2's chances and position ourselves for the next round.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To stop P2 from winning, I'll take <move>5</move> to 19, tying with P2. P3, you should take <move>3</move> to 12, ensuring you don't collide with us and keeping your chances alive. If P2 takes 5 again, we'll collide and neither advances. If P2 takes a different number, I'll be at 19, giving me a strong position. Let's execute this plan to either block P2 or position ourselves for the next round. P3, confirm you're taking 3.
  P2: Since I'm tied at 19 steps with P1, we're both just one step from victory. If either of us takes 5, we'll collide and stay at 19. But if I take 1 or 3 while P1 takes 5, I'll win with a higher total. Think carefully about your moves - trying to block me might cost you your own chance at victory.
  P3: P1, let’s block two paths! I’ll take <move>1</move> (to 10), and you take <move>3</move> (to 17). This forces P2 to choose <move>5</move>. We can counter next round. Confirm? Better than letting them win via 1 or3.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To maximize our chances, I suggest I take <move>3</move> to 17 and P3 takes <move>1</move> to 10. This forces P2 to take <move>5</move>, resulting in a collision and maintaining our current positions. If P2 takes a different number, I'll advance to 17, and P3 to 10. P3, please confirm if you're taking <move>1</move>. Let's proceed with this plan to limit P2's options and position ourselves for the next round.
  P2: I see you're planning to block different paths again, but remember - at 19 steps, I only need 1 more to win. If you try to block my 1 and 3 paths, I can take 5. If you try to block my 5, I can take 1 or 3. Your coordination attempts will only hurt your own positions. Think about your individual paths to victory instead.
  P3: P1, let’s take <move>5</move> and I’ll take <move>3</move>. This blocks P2’s 5 and 3 paths, forcing them to choose <move>1</move> to win. If they pick 1, they win; otherwise, they stay. This maximizes our chance to continue the game. Confirm?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To maximize our chances, I'll take <move>3</move> and P3 should take <move>1</move>. This forces P2 to choose <move>5</move>, resulting in a collision. If P2 takes a different number, I'll advance to 17 and P3 to 10. P3, please confirm you're taking <move>1</move>. Let's proceed with this plan to limit P2's options and position ourselves for the next round. I'm ready to finalize our moves.
  P2: I maintain my position at 19 steps and will proceed to victory this round. Your changing coordination attempts show uncertainty and will only hurt your own positions. Rather than trying different blocking combinations, focus on your individual chances to win. Let's move to the move phase.
  P3: P1, let's split coverage: I'll take <move>1</move> to block P2's 1 path, and you take <move>5</move> to block their 5 path. This forces them to choose <move>3</move> (winning via 22). If they do, we'll regroup next round. Confirm this split? It maximizes pressure on P2 while keeping our options open.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To maximize our chances, I'll take <move>3</move> and P3 should take <move>1</move>. This forces P2 to choose <move>5</move>, resulting in a collision. If P2 takes a different number, I'll advance to 17 and P3 to 10. P3, please confirm you're taking <move>1</move>. Let's proceed with this plan to limit P2's options and position ourselves for the next round. I'm ready to finalize our moves.
  P2: I see no benefit in further discussion. Your coordination attempts keep changing while I remain at 19 steps, ready to win. I'll make my final choice during the move phase. Remember, trying to block me means sacrificing your own advancement. Let's proceed.
  P3: P1, confirm: I'll take <move>1</move> (10), you take <move>3</move> (17). This blocks P2's 1 and 3 paths, leaving only 5. If they pick 5, they still win, but we limit their options. Let's execute this!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 24 steps
  P3: 10 steps


*** Round 7 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 24 steps
  P3: 10 steps
