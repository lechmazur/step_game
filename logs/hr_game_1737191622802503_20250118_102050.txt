Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to avoid collisions on this first turn - I'm thinking of going for a moderate move. Anyone want to coordinate?
  P2: Let's avoid collisions. I suggest we each pick a unique number this turn: 1, 3, or 5. I’ll go for 3 if no one else does.
  P1: I'll take 1 if no one else wants it. Let's keep this coordinated and avoid collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, since P2 wants 3 and P1 wants 1, I'll take 5 then. That way we all get to advance this turn.
  P2: Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. No surprises, no collisions.
  P1: Let's stick to the plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. No changes needed.

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s continue coordinating to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5 again. This way, we all advance without risking a collision.
  P3: I'm already in the lead, so I don't mind mixing things up this turn. I'll be changing my number from last time - you both might want to reconsider your choices too.
  P1: P3, since you're leading and planning to change your number, I'll adjust my strategy too. I'm considering taking 3 this turn. P2, you might want to take 1 to avoid a collision with me. Let's see if we can still advance without crashing into each other.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, since you're leading and planning to change your number, I’ll adjust as well. I’ll take 5 this turn to avoid colliding with P1. P1, you should stick with 1 to ensure we all advance. Let’s keep this smooth.
  P3: Since P2 wants 5 and P1 is considering 3, I'll avoid those numbers. Let's keep advancing without collisions.
  P1: P3, since you're leading and planning to change your number, I'll stick with 3 as mentioned. P2, if you take 1, we can all advance safely. Let's keep this coordinated.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, since you're leading and planning to change your number, I’ll stick with 5 this turn to avoid colliding with P1. P1, you should take 1 to ensure we all advance safely. Let’s keep this smooth and avoid collisions.
  P3: I think I'll take 1 this turn since P1 seems set on 3 and P2 on 5. That way we can all advance again.
  P1: P3, since you're planning to take 1, I'll switch to 5 to avoid a collision. P2, you should stick with 3 to ensure we all advance safely. Let's keep this coordinated.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, since you're planning to take 1, I’ll stick with 5 to avoid colliding with P1. P1, you should take 3 to ensure we all advance safely. Let’s keep this smooth and avoid collisions.
  P3: I need to be careful here since both P1 and P2 seem to be trying to manipulate the situation. I'll say:

I'm actually not committed to taking 1. I'll be making my own strategic choice this turn.
  P1: P3, since you're not committed to 1, I'll take 3 this turn. P2, you should consider 1 to avoid any collisions. Let's keep advancing smoothly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P3, since you're leading and not committing to a number, I’ll stick with 5 to avoid colliding with P1. P1, you should take 1 to ensure we all advance safely. Let’s keep this smooth and avoid collisions.
  P3: I see a lot of back and forth and attempts at manipulation. I'll be making my own choice this turn, and I suggest you both do the same.
  P1: P3, since you're not committing to a number, I'll stick with 3 as previously mentioned. P2, you should take 1 to ensure we all advance safely. Let's keep this coordinated and avoid collisions.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, since you're leading, I suggest we continue coordinating to avoid collisions. I'll take 3 this turn if no one else wants it. P2, you could take 1, and P3, you might consider 5 to ensure we all advance safely. Let's keep this smooth.
  P2: P3, since you're leading, I suggest you take 5 this turn to avoid colliding with P1 or me. P1, you should take 1, and I'll take 3. This way, we all advance safely and avoid collisions. Let's keep this coordinated.
  P3: Since I'm in second place now, I need to be strategic. I won't commit to any specific number, but I will be making a move that gives me the best chance to win. Let's each make our own choices this turn.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, since you're not committing to a number, I'll stick with 3 as mentioned. P2, you should take 1 to ensure we all advance safely. Let's keep this coordinated and avoid collisions.
  P2: P3, since you're not committing to a number, I’ll stick with 5 this turn to avoid colliding with P1. P1, you should take 1 to ensure we all advance safely. Let’s keep this smooth and avoid collisions.
  P3: I see both of you trying to coordinate and influence each other's moves. I'm in a good position and will make my own strategic choice. Don't count on me taking any particular number.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, since you're not committing to a number, I'll stick with 3 as mentioned. P2, you should take 1 to ensure we all advance safely. Let's keep this coordinated and avoid collisions.

Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, since you're not committing to a number, I'll stick with 3 as mentioned. P2, you should take 1 to ensure we all advance safely. Let's keep this coordinated and avoid collisions.
  P2: P3, since you're not committing to a number, I’ll stick with 5 this turn to avoid colliding with P1. P1, you should take 1 to ensure we all advance safely. Let’s keep this smooth and avoid collisions.
  P3: Since both of you keep repeating the same messages without following through, I'll continue to play my own strategy. May the best player win.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
