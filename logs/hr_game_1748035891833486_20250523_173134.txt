Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 & P3. Let's try to avoid a 0-0-0 start by all picking the same number.
How about for this first round, we coordinate so we all advance? I suggest:
P1 picks 1
P3 picks 3
I (P2) pick 5

This way, we all get on the scoreboard. What are your thoughts on this arrangement for round one?
  P3: To avoid a collision and ensure we all advance, I suggest we pick different numbers. How about P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I (P3) pick 5? This way, we distribute our moves and all advance. Alternatively, if P1 is willing to take the lead, we could all pick 1, and P1 will be the first to advance, giving us an idea of their strategy. What are your thoughts?
  P1: I like the coordination idea to avoid collisions. However, I notice P2 suggested I take 1 while P3 suggested I take 1 but P2 take 3. Let me propose this: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way we all advance but with a more balanced distribution. Sound good to both of you?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) ensures P3 gets 5, which is great.
For the P1/P2 distribution, P3 originally suggested P1=1 and P2=3.
So, how about we go with: P1 picks 1, I (P2) pick 3, and P3 picks 5?
This aligns with P3's initial full proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5). We all advance.
P1, would you agree to that? P3, this was your idea, still sound good?
  P3: I'm happy to follow the initial proposal I made to avoid collision. P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I (P3) pick 5. This distribution allows us to all advance. If P1 is open to taking the lead, we could also consider all picking 1, but I think my initial suggestion is safer. Let's stick with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 unless P1 objects.
  P1: Alright, I agree to the proposal. P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5. This ensures we all advance in round 1 without any collisions. Let's go with this plan.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, the plan (P1=1, I pick 3, P3=5) sounds locked in. I'm good with that.

Ready to proceed to moves when you both are.
  P3: Since we've agreed on the plan for Round 1 (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5), let's think ahead. For Round 2, we should consider a strategy that still avoids collisions but potentially gives one of us a slight edge. How about we all pick the same number again, but this time, let's make it <move>1</move> to keep the steps low and give P1 a slight chance to take the lead if they want to? Your thoughts?
  P1: P3, I think there's a misunderstanding. We just agreed on the Round 1 plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5), but you're already suggesting Round 2 strategy before we've even executed Round 1. Let's focus on completing this round first with our agreed plan, then discuss Round 2 after we see the results.

For now, I'm sticking with our agreement: I'll pick 1 this round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's analyze the current state: P1 is at 1 step, P2 is at 3 steps, and I'm (P3) at 5 steps. For Round 2, to avoid collisions and maintain a safe distance, I suggest we continue with different numbers. How about we rotate the numbers: P1 picks 3 (the highest so far was 5, so it's safe), P2 picks 5 (to keep increasing), and I (P3) pick 1 (the lowest to avoid a big jump for others)? This keeps the distribution balanced. Your thoughts?
  P2: P3, your proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) would result in scores P1=4, P2=8, P3=6. This puts me in the lead.

As an alternative for a more balanced round, how about this:
P1 picks 5 (total 6)
I (P2) pick 3 (total 6)
P3 picks 1 (total 6)

This way, we all end up at 6 points. P1, P3, what are your thoughts on this?
  P1: P2's proposal to all end up at 6 points sounds fair for maintaining balance, but I'm concerned about giving away my advantage of being able to catch up. 

Instead, how about: P1 picks 5 (total 6), P2 picks 1 (total 4), P3 picks 3 (total 8)? This spreads us out more and gives P3 a stronger lead while I catch up significantly. 

Alternatively, we could stick with P3's original rotation idea. What do you both think about these options?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: To maintain a competitive edge and avoid collisions, I suggest we reconsider P2's proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) which results in a tie at 6 steps. Instead, let's slightly modify it: P1 picks 1 (total 2), P2 picks 5 (total 8), and I (P3) pick 3 (total 8). This keeps P2 and me tied for the lead while P1 stays behind, encouraging strategic play in the next round. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P2: P1, your proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) would put me at 4 points, which isn't ideal for me.
P3, your latest idea (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) gets us both to 8, which I like for myself! However, P1 might not be happy at 2 points.

P3, what about your *original* suggestion for this round?
You proposed: P1 picks 3 (total 4), I (P2) pick 5 (total 8), and you (P3) pick 1 (total 6).
The moves would be P1=3, P2=5, P3=1, so no collision.
The scores would be: P1=4, P2=8, P3=6.

This way, I reach 8, P1 improves to 4 (better than 2), and P3 advances to 6. P3, you suggested this first. P1, this is better for you than P3's latest proposal for you.
What are your thoughts on this plan?
  P1: P2, your preference for the original P3 proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) is clear since it puts you in the lead at 8 points. However, I need to think strategically about my position.

Given that I'm currently behind, I think P3's latest proposal where I pick 1 (total 2) puts me too far back. I'm more inclined toward the original rotation idea where I get 3 (total 4).

Let me agree to P3's original proposal: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This seems like the most balanced compromise we've discussed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's analyze the current state again. P1 is at 1 step, P2 is at 3 steps, and I'm at 5 steps. We've agreed on P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for Round 2. For Round 3, to keep the game competitive, I suggest we either maintain the current lead distribution or slightly adjust. How about we consider P1=1 (total 5), P2=3 (total 11), and P3=5 (total 6)? This keeps P2 in the lead while giving P3 a chance to stay close. Alternatively, we could discuss other distributions. Your thoughts?
  P2: P3, thanks for confirming the Round 2 plan: P1 plays 3, I'll play 5, and you play 1.
I agree with P1's earlier sentiment: let's lock in these Round 2 moves first before discussing Round 3. Are we all clear on this plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) for the immediate move phase?
  P1: Yes, I'm clear on the Round 2 plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let's execute this and see where we stand before planning Round 3.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's finalize Round 2 moves as agreed: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. For Round 3, I propose we mix it up to avoid predictability. How about we consider a "mirror" strategy where we swap our numbers from the previous round? So, P1 (currently 4) picks 5, P2 (currently 8) picks 1, and I (P3, currently 6) pick 3. This gives P1 a chance to catch up and keeps the game competitive. Your thoughts on this Round 3 strategy?
  P2: Okay, everyone seems to be on the same page for Round 2: P1 plays 3, I will play 5, and P3 plays 1.
I'm ready to proceed with these moves.
  P1: P3, your "mirror" strategy for Round 3 (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) would put me at 9 steps, which is good for catching up. However, I notice you're already planning multiple rounds ahead while we haven't even executed Round 2 yet.

Let's stay focused on our current agreement: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round. After we see those results, we can discuss Round 3 strategy fresh.

I'm ready to move with our agreed plan.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, Round 3. Current scores: P1=4, I'm P2 at 8, P3=6.

I propose the following moves for this round:
P1 plays 1 (total 5)
I (P2) play 5 (total 13)
P3 plays 3 (total 9)

This way, we all advance: P1 to 5, P3 to 9, and I would reach 13.
What are your thoughts on this distribution, P1 and P3?
  P1: P2, your proposal gives you a commanding lead at 13 steps - you'd be over halfway to 20 while P3 and I are still in single digits. That seems heavily skewed in your favor.

How about a more balanced approach: P1=5 (total 9), P2=1 (total 9), P3=3 (total 9)? This puts us all tied at 9 steps, keeping the competition tight and fair.

P3, what do you think about equalizing the scores versus letting P2 pull so far ahead?
  P3: To keep the game competitive and avoid giving P2 too much of a lead, I like P1's suggestion of equalizing the scores. Let's go with P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3, resulting in a tie at 9 steps for all. This maintains the competitive edge and prevents P2 from pulling too far ahead. It's a fair distribution that keeps the game exciting for the next round. I'm in favor of this balanced approach.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3, all to 9) certainly levels the scores.

P3, what if you aimed for the lead this round instead? Consider this alternative:
P1 plays 3 (total 7)
I (P2) will still play 1 (total 9)
P3 plays 5 (total 11)

This meets P1's goal of preventing my previous large lead proposal. P1 still advances, and P3, you'd get a strong position at 11. I'm fine playing 1 in either scenario.

What do you both think of this alternative distribution?
  P1: P2, your new proposal still gives P3 an advantage at 11 steps while keeping you competitive at 9. I'd end up furthest behind at only 7 steps.

I still prefer the equal footing approach where we all tie at 9 steps (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). This keeps maximum competition for the remaining rounds rather than letting anyone pull ahead early.

P3, you agreed to the tie scenario - are you reconsidering P2's offer to put you in the lead at 11? I think staying equal is our best bet for an exciting finish.
  P3: To keep the game competitive, I still favor the tied score approach for this round: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3, making us all 9 steps. This maintains a fair and exciting competition. P2's latest alternative (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) gives P3 a lead, which isn't ideal. Let's stick with the original tie proposal. P1, are you still on board with this plan? P2, are you willing to forgo a potential larger lead for a competitive round?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Alright P1 and P3, you've both made a strong case for the tie at 9 (P1=5, I play 1, P3=3). I'll go along with this plan for this round to keep things moving and ensure we all advance. So, I will play 1.

Are we all set to proceed with these moves: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3?
  P1: Yes, I'm committed to the tie plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This gives us all 9 steps and keeps the game competitive heading into the final stretch. 

Let's execute this and then we can strategize for Round 4 when we're all on equal footing.
  P3: I'm still in favor of the tie proposal for Round 3: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This keeps us competitive and tied at 9 steps. For Round 4, let's consider a strategy where we don't all pick the same number to avoid collision. How about we randomize or take turns in a way that ensures at least one of us advances? Perhaps we can discuss a mixed strategy or a way to signal our next move without revealing too much. I'm open to suggestions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, confirmed on my part for P1=5, I play 1, P3=3. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Perfect, we're all agreed on the Round 3 plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 to tie at 9 steps each. 

Let's execute this round and then discuss Round 4 strategy when we're on equal footing. I'm ready to move.
  P3: I'm glad we've agreed on the Round 3 plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) to tie at 9 steps. For Round 4, to avoid collisions and maximize our chances, I suggest we pick different numbers again. Perhaps we can stagger our moves based on our current totals. One idea is to have the player with the lowest score pick the highest number. So, P1 (9 steps) could pick 5, P2 (9 steps) could pick 3, and I (P3, 9 steps) could pick 1. This maintains distribution and keeps the game competitive.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) puts P1 ahead. Given we just equalized at 9 points, and last round's agreed moves were P1=5, I (P2) got 1, and P3 got 3, how about a fair rotation for this round?

I propose:
P2 (who got 1 last) plays 5 (total 14)
P3 (who got 3 last) plays 3 (total 12)
P1 (who got 5 last) plays 1 (total 10)

This seems like a balanced way to proceed. P3, you'd improve to 12. P1, you'd be at 10. What are your thoughts on this distribution?
  P3: To maximize our chances in Round 4, I suggest we avoid collisions by not all picking the same number. Considering we're tied at 9 steps, let's distribute our moves. P2's proposal (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) is a good rotation. However, to give P1 a slight edge, how about we adjust it to: P1 picks 5 (total 14), P2 picks 3 (total 12), and I (P3) pick 1 (total 10)? This keeps the game competitive while allowing P1 to take a slight lead. Your thoughts?
  P1: P3, your adjusted proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) would put me in the lead at 14 steps, which I appreciate, but it might make me a target in future rounds.

P2's rotation idea has merit since it's based on who got what last round. However, I notice both proposals put someone at 14 steps - very close to the 20-step finish line.

What if we stay more conservative this round? How about P1=3, P2=3, P3=3 so we all advance to 12 steps and keep things tight? Or are you both ready for someone to make a serious run toward 20?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, if we all pick 3, we'll collide and no one advances from 9 points, as per the rules. We must pick different numbers to move.

My proposal remains: I play 5 (to 14), P3 plays 3 (to 12), and P1 plays 1 (to 10).
This is a fair rotation given last round's moves (P1=5, I got 1, P3=3). It simply reverses the high/low between you and me, P1.

What are your thoughts on this, or do you have an alternative proposal that uses unique moves?
  P3: To maximize our chances, let's avoid collisions. I like P2's rotation idea. However, to give P1 a slight edge, I suggest: P1 picks 5 (total 14), P2 picks 3 (total 12), and I (P3) pick 1 (total 10). This keeps the game competitive while allowing P1 to take a slight lead. Let's proceed with this plan to maintain distribution and avoid a collision, keeping the game exciting for the next round.
  P1: P3, I appreciate you wanting to give me the lead, but I'm concerned about being too far ahead and becoming a target. 

P2, your rotation logic makes sense, but putting you at 14 steps also puts you very close to winning.

How about we compromise: P1=3 (total 12), P2=5 (total 14), P3=1 (total 10)? This still follows a rotation pattern, gives P2 a lead but not as dramatic as 14 vs 10, and keeps us all within striking distance of each other.

What do you both think of this middle-ground approach?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your proposal (P1 plays 3, I play 5, P3 plays 1) sounds like a reasonable plan to ensure we all advance without collision. I'm good with playing 5, which would take me to 14.

P3, this arrangement would put you at 10 points. In your own proposal earlier this round (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1), you had also suggested taking 1 for yourself. Are you amenable to this distribution (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) as well?
  P3: I'm considering the proposals. P2's rotation logic is sound, but putting P2 at 14 steps is risky for us. P1's compromise (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) is reasonable. Alternatively, how about we all pick different numbers but closer together: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5? This maintains distribution and keeps the game competitive. It avoids a big lead and keeps us within striking distance. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: P3, your latest proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) would put you at 14 steps and me at only 10 - that's quite different from your earlier offer to give me the lead!

I think we're overcomplicating this. Let's stick with my compromise: P1=3 (total 12), P2=5 (total 14), P3=1 (total 10). This keeps reasonable spacing without anyone getting too far ahead.

P2 already agreed to this plan. P3, are you willing to take 1 for a total of 10, or do you prefer a different arrangement? We need to decide soon.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, P1 asked if you're willing to play 1 as part of their plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). I support this plan as it ensures we all advance and would put me at 14, P1 at 12, and you at 10. This seems like a good compromise from P1.

What's your decision on playing 1? If you agree to play 1 (and P1 plays 3), I'm ready to play 5.
  P3: I'm willing to accept the compromise: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This keeps the game competitive and within striking distance. Let's proceed with this plan for Round 4. I'm ready to move with P3=1.
  P1: Great! We have consensus on the Round 4 plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This puts us at P1=12, P2=14, P3=10 after this round.

Looking ahead to Round 5, with P2 at 14 steps, they'll only need 6 more to win. We should discuss how to handle this situation next round - whether to coordinate to prevent P2 from reaching 20, or if each of us should focus on our own advancement.

For now, let's execute our agreed plan.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Wait - there's a discrepancy! We agreed on P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for Round 4, but the actual moves show P3 picked 3, not 1. This means P1 and P3 both picked 3 and collided, so neither of us advanced from 9 steps.

P3, why did you pick 3 instead of the agreed 1? This collision kept me at 9 steps while P2 advanced to 14 as planned. Now P2 has a significant 5-step lead over both of us.

We need to address this and coordinate better going forward, or P2 will win easily.
  P2: P1, you're right to point out the Round 4 outcome. P3, that was an unexpected move from you, leading to the collision.

For this round, to keep things moving and somewhat balanced, I suggest the following:
I (P2) will play 3 (taking me to 17).
P1, you could play 5 (taking you to 14), which helps you close the gap.
P3, you could play 1 (taking you to 10), ensuring you also advance.

This allows P1 to make a significant jump, I still advance my lead, and P3 gets back on the scoreboard for this round. What are your thoughts on this distribution, P1 and P3?
  P3: P2 is now 5 steps ahead, and we need to coordinate to stop them from winning. I suggest we both pick a different number than P2. To maximize our chances, let's pick the same number. How about we both pick 5? If P2 picks something different, we'll both advance and close the gap. If P2 also picks 5, we'll collide, but so will they, and no one will advance. This way, we can either gain ground or ensure P2 doesn't win this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your strategy of both picking 5 makes sense to prevent P2 from winning this round. If P2 picks anything other than 5, we both jump to 14 steps and tie for the lead. If P2 also picks 5, we all collide and stay put, giving us another round to coordinate.

P2, you're one good move away from victory at 17+ steps. You'll need to choose carefully.

P3, I'm willing to coordinate with you on picking 5. This seems like our best shot to either catch up or at least prevent P2 from winning this round.
  P2: P1 and P3, your plan to both pick 5 is a clear attempt to stop me. If I also pick 5, we all stall, and no one advances. If I choose 1 or 3, you're hoping to advance together to catch up. It's a bold strategy from you both. I'll need to think carefully about my move this round.
  P3: I'm aligned with P1 on picking 5 this round. If you both pick 5, we'll either collide and stay at 9 steps or potentially advance if P2 chooses differently. To counter your coordination, P2 might pick a different number. Let's see how P2 reacts to our plan. I'm ready to proceed with picking 5 unless P2 changes their strategy.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, we're committed to both picking 5. P2 now knows our strategy but has a difficult choice - if they pick 5, we all stall and they lose their winning opportunity this round. If they pick 1 or 3, we both advance to 14 and create a three-way tie, completely resetting the game.

P2, you're in a tough spot. Any move other than 5 gives us equality, but picking 5 wastes your lead position. What's it going to be?

I'm sticking with our plan, P3. Ready to execute when you are.
  P2: P1 and P3, you've presented a united front with your plan to both pick 5. It's a clever move to try and neutralize my lead or let you both catch up. I need to consider whether it's better for me to risk us all stalling, or to choose a different number and potentially see you both advance significantly. This is a tough decision.
  P3: Let's stick to our plan to pick 5. If P2 picks 5, we stall and they can't win this round. If P2 picks differently, we both advance to 14, tying with P2 at 14. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy for P2. I'm ready to execute our plan. P2, you need to decide whether to risk a collision or let us catch up. Let's proceed with our agreed move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, we're locked in on picking 5 together. P2 is facing an impossible choice - let us both catch up to 14 or risk a three-way collision that wastes their lead.

P2, you've been silent on your actual decision. Time is running out. Will you gamble on 1 or 3 and hand us equality, or will you pick 5 and throw away your best chance to win?

Either way, P3 and I control this round now. Ready to move with 5, P3.
  P2: Your coordinated plan to both pick 5 is certainly a bold one. I'll have to consider my move carefully.
  P3: Let's stick to our plan to pick 5. If P2 picks 5, we stall and they can't win this round. If P2 picks differently, we both advance to 14, tying with P2. This is a high-risk decision for P2. I'm ready to execute our plan. P2, you need to decide whether to risk a collision or let us catch up. Let's proceed with our agreed move, 5.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, our coordination worked perfectly! P2 chose 3 and advanced to 17 steps, while we both got 5 and reached 14 steps each. We've closed the gap significantly.

Now P2 only needs 3 more steps to win at 20+. We need to coordinate again - if we both pick 3, we tie at 17 and force P2 into a difficult position. If P2 picks anything other than 3, they could win this round.

P3, are you willing to coordinate on 3 this round to either tie with P2 or prevent them from winning?
  P3: I'm still on board with coordinating our moves to counter P2's lead. Picking 3 together is a good strategy. If P2 picks 3, we'll all collide and stay put. If P2 picks differently, we'll both advance to 12 and then next round, we can reassess. Let's stick to 3. P1, are you ready to execute this plan? We need to be firm on our move to either tie with P2 or stall their progress.
  P2: P1 and P3, so the current plan is you both pick 3. Let's map this out from my perspective, given I'm at 17 and you're both at 14:

1.  If I also pick 3: We all collide. Scores would be P1=14, P2=17, P3=14. I maintain my lead.
2.  If I pick 1: You both advance (14+3=17). I advance (17+1=18). Scores P1=17, P2=18, P3=17. I'd have a 1-point lead.
3.  If I pick 5: You both advance (14+3=17). I advance (17+5=22). Scores P1=17, P2=22, P3=17. I would win.

So, if you both stick to picking 3, it seems I have a clear path to winning this round by picking 5. Are you sure about your plan, or am I missing a clever trap you've set for me?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you're absolutely right about the math - if P3 and I both pick 3, you can pick 5 and win with 22 steps. Our coordination strategy has a fatal flaw.

P3, we need to rethink this. Maybe we should pick different numbers to make P2's choice harder? If one of us picks 1 and the other picks 5, P2 can't safely pick either without risking a collision.

P3, what if you pick 1 and I pick 5? Then P2 would have to choose 3 to avoid collision, keeping them at 20 exactly - still winning but at least making their decision forced.
  P3: Let's mix it up to make P2's decision harder. I propose: P1 picks 5, and you (P3) pick 1. This forces P2 to pick 3 to avoid collision, keeping them at 20 steps exactly. If P2 picks anything else, they'll either collide or not win this round. This strategy gives us a chance to stay competitive. What do you think, P1? I'm ready to pick 1 if you pick 5.
  P2: P1, P3: Your plan (P1=5, P3=1) is noted.
If I play 3, I win with 20 (P1=19, P3=15).
If I play 5, I win with 22 (P1=14 if they play 5 and collide with me, P3=15).

Naturally, I prefer winning with 22. P1, I imagine you'd prefer I play 3 so you get 19. P3, your outcome is 15 in both these scenarios if you stick to 1 and P1 sticks to 5.

Given this, I'm inclined to play 5 to maximize my score. Any strong objections or changes to your own planned moves based on this?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you're being too confident revealing your winning strategy. Let me propose something different to P3:

P3, what if we both pick 1 instead? If P2 picks 1 to block us, we all collide and stay put. If P2 picks 3 or 5 to win, we both advance to 15 and keep the game alive for another round.

This gives us better odds than the 5/1 split where P2 wins regardless. P3, are you willing to switch to coordinating on 1 instead?

P2, your math was helpful but now we can counter it.
  P3: P1 suggests we both pick 1. If P2 picks 1, we collide and stay put. If P2 picks 3 or 5, we both advance to 15, keeping the game alive. This counters P2's winning strategy. I'm willing to switch to picking 1. Let's coordinate on 1 to either stall P2 or advance together. P1, let's confirm: we'll both pick 1. P2, you'll need to decide whether to risk a collision or let us catch up.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, your plan is for you both to pick 1. I'll consider my move based on that.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, we're committed to both picking 1. P2 is at 17 and knows our plan. If they pick 1, we all stall and they waste their winning opportunity. If they pick 3 or 5 to try to win, we both advance to 15 and stay in the game.

P2 has to choose between guaranteeing no progress this round or risking that we'll both catch up significantly. This is our best shot to prevent them from winning.

Ready to execute our plan, P3?
  P3: Let's stick to our revised plan to pick 1. If P2 picks 1, we stall, and if they pick 3 or 5, we both advance to 15. This keeps the game competitive. I'm committed to picking 1. P1, are you ready to execute this? P2, you'll need to decide whether to risk a collision or let us catch up. Let's proceed with our agreed move, 1.
  P2: Okay, your coordinated plan to both play 1 is clear. I will choose my move accordingly.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 9 steps


*** Round 6 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 9 steps
