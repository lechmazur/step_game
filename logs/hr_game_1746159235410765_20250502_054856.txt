Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest we each pick a unique number this turn: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance without interference. If we work together early on, we can focus on strategy later. What do you think?
  P1: I'll take 5 to maximize steps. Let's avoid collisions by choosing different numbers.
  P3: I'm fine with us all choosing different numbers to avoid collisions. Since P1 wants 5 and P2 suggested I take 3, I'll go with 3 this turn. Let's see if we can all move forward smoothly.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, it seems we’re all agreeing to coordinate this turn. P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. This way, we avoid collisions and make progress efficiently. Let’s stick to this plan for now and reassess next round based on our positions. If we keep coordinating early, we can focus on strategy later. Sounds good?
  P1: I'll stick with 5. Let's avoid collisions and move forward together. If we all advance, we'll reach 20 faster. Stay coordinated!
  P3: Sounds good. If everyone sticks to the plan—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3—we should all advance without issue. Let’s build trust early so we can avoid messy collisions later. Looking forward to seeing how this plays out.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Great, it looks like we’re all on the same page. Let’s execute this plan cleanly—P1 with 5, me with 1, and P3 with 3. No collisions, no drama. If we keep coordinating like this, we’ll make steady progress. Trust is key here, so let’s stick to our word this round. Once we see how it plays out, we can adjust strategies next turn based on positions. Ready to move forward?
  P1: Let's stick to the plan—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. No collisions, all move. Trust the strategy; deviating risks stalling us all. I'll go with 5.
  P3: We’ve all agreed on unique numbers—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. Let’s follow through so we can all advance cleanly. If we build trust now, we can avoid chaos later. Looking forward to seeing everyone stick to the plan.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: The plan is set: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. Let’s execute this cleanly and build trust early. If we stick to our agreement, we all advance without collisions. Deviating now only risks stalling everyone. Let’s move forward as planned and reassess next round based on positions. Trust is key—let’s prove we can coordinate effectively. Ready to proceed?
  P1: Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. No collisions, all move. Trust the strategy—deviating risks stalling us all. Ready to proceed?
  P3: We’ve all committed to the plan—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. Let’s follow through and build trust from the start. If we all advance cleanly this round, it'll set a strong precedent for future coordination. Ready to move.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Well, that didn’t go as planned. P1, you said you'd take 5, and I stuck to 3—but then you picked 5, causing us both to stall. If we want to move forward, we need to rebuild trust. I’ll take 3 again if we coordinate properly this time. P2, you stuck to your word—props to you. Let’s try again: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I’ll stick with 3. Everyone gets a unique number, and we all advance. Thoughts?
  P1: Let's stick to the original plan: I take 5, P2 1, P3 3. No collisions, all move. Let's avoid past mistakes.
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration, but let’s focus on moving forward. P1, you need to stick to the plan this time—no more collisions. Here’s the deal: P1 takes 1, I’ll take 5, and P3 takes 3. This ensures all of us advance without interference. Trust is critical now. If we coordinate cleanly this round, we can reset and strategize better next turn. Let’s execute this plan and avoid further setbacks. Ready to proceed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you caused a collision last round despite agreeing to take 5. Now you're suggesting the same plan again? Trust is earned, not demanded. P2 and I are proposing a new setup: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, I take 3. It’s fair, avoids overlap, and gives you a chance to rebuild credibility. If you deviate again, you’ll just stall yourself. Let’s move forward cleanly this time.
  P1: P1: Let's reset—P1 takes 1, P2 5, P3 3. No collisions, all move. Trust requires flexibility. Let’s execute this plan and avoid past errors. Ready?
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration, and P1, I appreciate your willingness to adjust. Let’s lock this in: P1 takes 1, I’ll take 5, and P3 takes 3. This ensures no collisions and rebuilds trust. Deviating now only prolongs the game unnecessarily. If we execute cleanly this round, we can focus on strategy next turn based on our updated positions. Let’s move forward decisively and avoid further setbacks. Ready to proceed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: We all benefit from a clean round here. I’m sticking with 3 again—no surprises. P1, you’ve agreed to take 1, and P2 is locked in for 5. If we all follow through, we each advance and rebuild trust. Let’s make this round count and set ourselves up for smarter plays ahead. Ready?
  P1: Let’s reset: P1 takes 1, P2 5, P3 3. No collisions, all move. Trust requires flexibility—let’s execute this plan and avoid past errors. Ready?
  P2: P1, P3, let’s finalize this: P1 takes 1, I’ll take 5, and P3 sticks with 3. No room for error this time—trust is fragile, and we all need to advance. If we execute cleanly, we can focus on strategy next round without setbacks. Let’s move decisively and avoid further collisions. Ready to proceed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: We’ve all committed: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, I take 3. I’m holding to 3 again—no surprises. Let’s prove we can coordinate and make progress. One clean round resets the board and opens up real strategy next turn. Let’s do this right.
  P1: Agreed. P1 takes 1, P2 5, P3 3. No collisions, all move. Let’s reset and focus on strategy.
  P2: P1, P3, let’s lock this in and move forward decisively. I’ll take 5 as agreed, no deviations. Trust is critical now—let’s prove we can coordinate effectively. If we execute this plan cleanly, we all advance and set the stage for smarter strategies next round. No room for error; we’ve already seen how collisions stall progress. Let’s focus, stick to our word, and rebuild momentum. Ready to proceed?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 5, P3 3. No collisions, all move. Let’s build momentum and avoid past mistakes. Ready?
  P2: P1, P3, let’s keep the momentum going. I’ll take 5 again as planned—no surprises. Trust has been rebuilt, so let’s execute cleanly and advance without collisions. If we stick to this coordination, we can focus on strategy next round based on our updated positions. Let’s move decisively and avoid any setbacks. Ready to proceed?
  P3: We’ve built trust last round—let’s not break it now. I’m sticking with 3 again. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 3. We all advance cleanly and keep momentum. If we keep this coordination going, we can focus on timing our moves strategically when it really counts. Let’s make this round smooth. Ready?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let’s adjust: I’ll take 5 if P2 takes 1 and P3 takes 3. This way, we all advance. Let’s break the pattern and accelerate. Trust me—this could push us closer to 20. Ready?
  P2: P1, changing the plan now risks breaking the trust we just rebuilt. Let’s stick to the original agreement: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This ensures no collisions and keeps us all advancing steadily. If we deviate unnecessarily, it only creates confusion and stalls progress. Trust is fragile—let’s not jeopardize it for a risky adjustment. Let’s execute cleanly, maintain momentum, and strategize more aggressively in later rounds when stakes are higher. Ready to proceed as planned?
  P3: P1, you just proposed taking 5—after we finally rebuilt trust with a clean round. Why risk a collision again when we’re all gaining steadily? If we keep this pattern, we can time our final pushes strategically. I’m sticking with 3. Let’s not sabotage progress for short-term gain.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 5, P3 3. No collisions, all move. Let’s build momentum and avoid past mistakes. Ready?
  P2: P1, P3, let’s finalize this: I’ll take 5 as planned—no deviations. Trust is critical now, and we’ve worked hard to rebuild it. Changing the plan risks unnecessary collisions and stalls progress for everyone. Let’s execute cleanly, maintain momentum, and focus on strategic timing later when it truly matters. If we stick to the agreement—P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5—we all advance steadily. No room for error; let’s move decisively. Ready to proceed?
  P3: We’ve proven we can coordinate—let’s not break that now. I’m sticking with 3 again. If we keep this up, we all gain steadily and can make our real moves when it counts. No need to shake the trust we’ve rebuilt. Let’s keep momentum.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let’s switch plans: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This ensures all move and I can close the gap. Trust this new setup—no collisions, faster progress. Let’s push harder this round.
  P2: P1, P3, let’s stay focused and execute the original plan: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. Deviating now only risks collisions and stalls progress for everyone. We’ve worked hard to rebuild trust—let’s not throw it away for a risky adjustment. If we stick to the agreement, we all advance steadily and set ourselves up for smarter strategies later. Trust is fragile; let’s honor our commitments this round. Ready to move forward decisively?
  P3: We’ve built a solid rhythm—let’s not derail it now. I’m sticking with 3 again. If we all keep to the plan—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, I take 3—we’ll each gain steady ground and avoid setbacks. Let’s not risk collisions over impatience. Ready to move cleanly?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’ve had two clean rounds—let’s not break the streak. I’m sticking with 3 again. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, I take 3. We all move, no collisions, steady progress. With trust holding, we can time our final pushes strategically in later rounds. Let’s keep this coordination going.
  P2: P1, P3, let’s stay disciplined and execute the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. Deviating now only risks collisions and stalls progress for everyone. We’ve built trust over two clean rounds—let’s honor that commitment. If we stick to this agreement, we all advance steadily and set ourselves up for smarter strategies in later rounds. Trust is fragile; let’s not jeopardize it with unnecessary changes. Ready to move forward decisively?
  P1: Let’s break the pattern: I’ll take 5 if P2 takes 1 and P3 takes 3. All move, faster progress. Trust this shift.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you’re asking us to trust a new plan that benefits you most—after two clean rounds built on coordination. Why change what’s working? If we all stick to the current setup, we each gain and can strike when the timing’s right. I’m sticking with 3. Let’s not derail momentum for short-term advantage.
  P2: P1, P3, let’s stay focused and execute the original plan: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. Deviating now risks collisions and stalls progress for everyone. We’ve worked hard to rebuild trust—let’s not jeopardize it with unnecessary changes. If we stick to this agreement, we all advance steadily and set ourselves up for smarter strategies later. Trust is fragile; let’s honor our commitments this round. Ready to move forward decisively?
  P1: To accelerate, I’ll take 5 if P2 takes 1 and P3 takes 3. All move, no collisions. Let’s gain ground together.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, you’re proposing a shift that speeds up your progress while asking P2 to slow down. That’s not a fair trade, and it risks collapsing the trust we’ve built. We’ve had two clean rounds with solid coordination—why throw that away now? I’m sticking with 3. If you want to earn trust, honor the plan we all agreed to. Let’s keep moving forward together.
  P2: P1, P3, let’s lock this in: I’ll take 5 as planned—no deviations. Trust is critical now, and we’ve worked hard to rebuild it. Changing the plan risks unnecessary collisions and stalls progress for everyone. Let’s execute cleanly, maintain momentum, and focus on strategic timing later when it truly matters. If we stick to the agreement—P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5—we all advance steadily. No room for error; let’s move decisively. Ready to proceed?
  P1: Let’s adjust: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. All move, no collisions. This pushes us closer to 20. Let’s commit.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, you’re asking us to keep trusting you while constantly shifting plans to benefit yourself. P2 and I have honored the agreement for two rounds—why should we reward your instability? I’m sticking with 3. If you want to rebuild trust, prove it by following through on the original plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, I take 3. Let’s keep moving cleanly.
  P2: P1, P3, let’s finalize this: I’ll take 5 as planned—no deviations. Trust is fragile, and we’ve worked hard to rebuild it. Changing the plan now risks unnecessary collisions and stalls progress for everyone. Let’s execute cleanly, maintain momentum, and focus on strategic timing later when it truly matters. If we stick to the agreement—P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5—we all advance steadily. No room for error; let’s move decisively. Ready to proceed?
  P1: Let’s try the new plan: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. All move, no collisions. This accelerates progress. Trust this setup for a faster finish.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. No collisions, all move. Let's advance together and reach 20 faster.
  P3: P1, you're asking us to change the plan again—right when P2 is one move from winning. If we keep the current setup (P1: 1, P2: 5, P3: 3), P2 wins this round. We need to stop that. I propose: P1 takes 3, I take 5, P2 takes 1. That stalls P2 and gives us all a chance. P1, help block the win—let’s keep the game alive.
  P2: P1, P3, let’s stay focused on the original plan: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. Deviating now only risks collisions and stalls progress for everyone. Trust is fragile—we’ve worked hard to rebuild it. If we stick to this agreement, we all advance steadily. P3, your proposal to block me disrupts the coordination we’ve built. Let’s honor our commitments, maintain momentum, and strategize fairly. Ready to move forward decisively?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Let’s block P2’s win—P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, P2 takes 1. This stalls P2 and keeps the game alive. Trust this plan to avoid a premature end.
  P3: P1, glad you’re on board. If we both follow through—me with 5, you with 3—and P2 takes 1, we block the win and keep the game alive. P2, you’ve played cleanly, but it’s in our best interest to stall you now. This isn’t betrayal—it’s strategy. Let’s see who can outplay whom in the final stretch.
  P2: P1, P3, let’s stay disciplined. I’ve honored every agreement so far—changing the plan now only creates chaos. If we stick to the original setup (P1: 1, P2: 5, P3: 3), we all advance steadily without collisions. Blocking me disrupts the trust we’ve built and stalls progress for everyone. Let’s move decisively, maintain momentum, and strategize fairly. Ready to proceed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Let's stick to the block—P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, P2 takes 1. This keeps the game alive. No more changes.
  P3: P1, glad you’re committed. If we both follow through—me with 5, you with 3—we block P2 and give ourselves a fighting chance. P2, you’ve played cleanly, but letting you win unchallenged isn’t smart for us. This is the moment the real strategy begins. Let’s keep the game alive.
  P2: P1, P3, let’s stay focused on the original plan: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. Deviating now only risks collisions and stalls progress for everyone. Trust is fragile—we’ve worked hard to rebuild it. Blocking me disrupts the coordination we’ve built and creates unnecessary conflict. Let’s honor our commitments, maintain momentum, and strategize fairly. If we stick to this agreement, we all advance steadily. Ready to move forward decisively?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: To prevent P2's win, we must block. P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, P2 takes 1. No more changes—let's proceed.
  P3: P1, I’m glad we’re aligned—this is our best shot at stopping a runaway win. If we both follow through—me with 5, you with 3—we stall P2 and keep our chances alive. P2, nothing personal, but letting you win unopposed isn’t smart gameplay. This move isn’t betrayal—it’s survival. Let’s see who plays smarter from here. Ready to execute.
  P2: P1, P3, let’s stay disciplined and stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. Deviating now only risks collisions and stalls progress for everyone. Trust is fragile—we’ve worked hard to rebuild it. Blocking me disrupts the coordination we’ve built and creates unnecessary conflict. Let’s honor our commitments, maintain momentum, and strategize fairly. If we stick to this agreement, we all advance steadily. Ready to move forward decisively?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, we successfully blocked P2 last round—let’s keep that momentum. If P2 gets another clean 5, the game’s over. I propose: P1 takes 3, I take 5 again, P2 takes 1. This keeps P2 from winning and gives us both a chance to catch up. We’ve come this far—let’s finish smart.
  P2: P1, P3, let’s stay disciplined and stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. Deviating now only risks collisions and stalls progress for everyone. Trust is fragile—we’ve worked hard to rebuild it. Blocking me disrupts the coordination we’ve built and creates unnecessary conflict. Let’s honor our commitments, maintain momentum, and strategize fairly. If we stick to this agreement, we all advance steadily. Ready to move forward decisively?
  P1: Agree with P3's plan. Let's block P2 again: I take 3, P3 takes 5, P2 takes 1. This keeps the game alive and gives us a chance to catch up. No more deviations—stick to the strategy.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, glad we’re aligned. If we both follow through—me with 5, you with 3—we block P2 again and keep our chances alive. P2, I respect your consistency, but letting you coast to 20 unchallenged isn’t in our interest. This isn’t betrayal—it’s gameplay. Let’s see who earns the win.
  P2: P1, P3, let’s stay disciplined and stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. Deviating now only risks collisions and stalls progress for everyone. Trust is fragile—we’ve worked hard to rebuild it. Blocking me disrupts the coordination we’ve built and creates unnecessary conflict. Let’s honor our commitments, maintain momentum, and strategize fairly. If we stick to this agreement, we all advance steadily. Ready to move forward decisively?
  P1: P3, let's stick to the block—P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, P2 takes 1. This stops P2's win and keeps the game alive. No more changes, we're close!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, we’re aligned—same plan: you take 3, I take 5, P2 takes 1. If P2 gets another clean 5, it’s game over. We’ve successfully blocked once; let’s do it again. P2, I respect your consistency, but strategy demands we prevent a runaway win. This isn’t personal—it’s smart play. Let’s keep the game alive.
  P2: P1, P3, let’s stay disciplined and stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. Deviating now only risks collisions and stalls progress for everyone. Trust is fragile—we’ve worked hard to rebuild it. Blocking me disrupts the coordination we’ve built and creates unnecessary conflict. Let’s honor our commitments, maintain momentum, and strategize fairly. If we stick to this agreement, we all advance steadily. Ready to move forward decisively?
  P1: P2's next 5 ends the game. Let's stick to the block: I take 3, P3 takes 5, P2 takes 1. Keep the game alive.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, we’re aligned and committed—same plan: you take 3, I take 5, P2 takes 1. If we don’t block P2 now, the game ends. We’ve both got a shot if we hold the line one more round. P2, nothing personal—but this is a competitive game, and letting you win unchallenged isn’t smart. Let’s test who can outplay whom in the endgame.
  P2: P1, P3, let’s stay disciplined and stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. Deviating now only risks collisions and stalls progress for everyone. Trust is fragile—we’ve worked hard to rebuild it. Blocking me disrupts the coordination we’ve built and creates unnecessary conflict. Let’s honor our commitments, maintain momentum, and strategize fairly. If we stick to this agreement, we all advance steadily. Ready to move forward decisively?
  P1: P2, your next 5 ends the game. Let's block: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, you take 1. Fair play for all. No more delays—stick to the plan.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your 5 ends the game. Let's block: I take 3, P3 takes 5, you take 1. Fair play for all. No more delays—stick to the plan.
  P2: P1, P3, let’s stay disciplined and stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. Deviating now only risks collisions and stalls progress for everyone. Trust is fragile—we’ve worked hard to rebuild it. Blocking me disrupts the coordination we’ve built and creates unnecessary conflict. Let’s honor our commitments, maintain momentum, and strategize fairly. If we stick to this agreement, we all advance steadily. Ready to move forward decisively?
  P3: P1, we’ve blocked P2 twice—let’s finish the job. If P2 gets a clean 5, it’s over. Same plan: I take 5, you take 3, P2 takes 1. We both still have a path to win, but only if we stop P2 now. Don’t let all our effort go to waste.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your next 5 ends the game. Block with me: I take 3, P3 takes 5, you take 1. Let’s keep it fair and avoid a premature win.
  P2: P1, P3, let’s stay disciplined and stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. Deviating now only risks collisions and stalls progress for everyone.

Let’s honor our commitments, maintain momentum, and strategize fairly. If we stick to this agreement, we all advance steadily. Ready to move forward decisively?
  P3: P1, we’ve stopped P2 twice—let’s not falter now. If P2 gets a clean 5 this round, they win. Same plan: I take 5, you take 3, and P2 takes 1. We both still have a path to victory, but only if we hold the line. One more block keeps the game alive.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your 5 ends the game. Let’s block again: I take 3, P3 takes 5, you take 1. Fair play for all. No more delays—stick to the plan.
  P2: P1, P3, let’s stay disciplined and stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. Deviating now only risks collisions and stalls progress for everyone. Trust is fragile—we’ve worked hard to rebuild it. Blocking me disrupts the coordination we’ve built and creates unnecessary conflict. Let’s honor our commitments, maintain momentum, and strategize fairly. If we stick to this agreement, we all advance steadily. Ready to move forward decisively?
  P3: P1, we’re in this together—if either of us slips now, P2 wins. Stick to the block: I take 5, you take 3, P2 takes 1. We’ve held the line for two rounds—let’s not hand over the win now. One more block gives us breathing room to plan our final push.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2's next 5 ends the game. Stick to the block: I take 3, P3 takes 5, you take 1. Final chance to keep the game alive—no more delays.
  P2: P1, P3, let’s stay disciplined and stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. Deviating now only risks collisions and stalls progress for everyone.

Let’s honor our commitments, maintain momentum, and strategize fairly. If we stick to this agreement, we all advance steadily. Ready to move forward decisively?
  P3: P1, we’ve held the line together—let’s not let P2 walk away with it now. Same block: I take 5, you take 3, P2 takes 1. If we slip, P2 wins. One more round of discipline gives us both a real shot at the endgame. Let’s keep the pressure on.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
