The goal is to reach or exceed 16 steps, and the first one to do so wins. If multiple players reach or exceed 16 in the same round, the one with the highest total steps wins. If there's a tie, they share the victory.\n\nIn the previous rounds, we tried coordinating our moves to avoid collisions. In Round 1, P1 took 1, I took 3, and P3 took 5. In Round 2, P1 took 5, I took 3, and P3 took 1. This seemed to work well, as none of us collided on the same number in those rounds.\n\nHowever, now that we're all at 6 steps, we need to plan carefully to avoid stepping on each other's moves again. I think it's crucial that we continue to coordinate our choices to maximize our individual progress without hindering each other.\n\nPerhaps we can establish a pattern where each round, we rotate the step sizes we choose. For example, in Round 3, maybe P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. Then in Round 4, P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3, and so on. This way, we're always moving forward, and the step sizes are distributed evenly among us.\n\nBut I'm open to suggestions. Maybe there's a better way to approach this. What do you both think about continuing to coordinate our moves in this manner? Or should we consider a different strategy?\n\nAlso, perhaps we can start sharing our intended moves in advance during the conversation phase to ensure that we don't pick the same numbers. That might help us avoid collisions more effectively.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?"}
