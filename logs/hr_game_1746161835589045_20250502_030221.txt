Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest we each pick a unique number this turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance without interference. If we work together early on, we can focus on strategy later. What do you think?
  P1: I agree with P3's plan. Let's take 1, 3, 5 to avoid collisions. All move forward. Good start!
  P2: 


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P2, do you agree with the plan? If we stick to unique numbers like 1, 3, and 5 this turn, we all advance without collisions. It’s a fair way to start, and we can adjust strategies later. Let me know your thoughts or if you have a better idea. Otherwise, let’s confirm and move forward.
  P1: P2, your turn to confirm. Let's stick to 1, 3, 5. No collisions—ready?
  P2: 


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: P2, time is running out. If you don’t confirm, I’ll assume you’re going rogue. P1 and I are committed to 1 and 5—don’t force a collision. Let’s keep it clean and strategic. Confirm or adapt now.
  P1: P2, confirm the plan. 1, 3, 5 ensures all advance. Don’t let hesitation cost us. Let’s move forward!
  P2: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, last round’s collision cost us both progress. Let’s avoid repeating that mistake. I suggest we stick to unique numbers again—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures no collisions and keeps us all advancing steadily. If anyone has a better plan, speak now. Otherwise, let’s confirm and move forward cleanly.
  P1: Let's avoid collisions. I'll take 3, P2 take 1, P3 take 5. All advance. Ready?
  P2: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P2, you’ve been silent twice now, and it’s costing us progress. Last round’s collision between you and P1 didn’t help anyone. Let’s fix this—stick to unique numbers. P1 suggested 3 for themselves, 1 for you, and 5 for me. This is fair and avoids collisions. If you don’t confirm or cooperate, I’ll assume you’re playing unpredictably, and we’ll adjust accordingly. Confirm the plan or share your thoughts—let’s move forward strategically.
  P1: P2, confirm: I take 3, you take 1, P3 takes 5. No collisions. Let’s move forward!
  P2: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: P2, your silence is frustrating and counterproductive. If you won’t confirm or cooperate, I’ll assume you’re intentionally trying to collide. P1 and I are committed to avoiding chaos—so unless you respond now, I’ll adapt my strategy accordingly. Let’s keep this game fair and strategic. Confirm the plan or face the consequences.
  P1: P2, let's stick to 1,3,5. I'll take 3, you take 1, P3 takes 5. No collisions—confirm or we risk another stalemate.
  P2: 


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: P2, your silence is becoming a pattern, and it’s holding us back. If you won’t cooperate, I’ll adjust my strategy to ensure I stay ahead. P1, let’s focus on advancing without relying on P2’s input. I suggest we stick to unique numbers again—P1 takes 1, I’ll take 5, and P2 can have 3 unless they finally speak up. If P2 continues to ignore us, we’ll treat them as unpredictable and plan accordingly. Let’s move forward decisively.
  P1: P2, let's take 3 and 5. Avoid P3's 1. Don't let them win. Confirm now.
  P2: 


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P2, your continued silence is unacceptable. If you refuse to engage, I’ll assume you’re deliberately trying to sabotage progress. P1 and I are committed to advancing—let’s coordinate without you if necessary. P1, let’s stick to unique numbers: you take 1, I’ll take 5, and P2 can have 3 by default. If P2 doesn’t confirm, we’ll treat them as rogue. Let’s focus on winning.
  P1: P2, let's take 3 and 5 to bypass P3. Confirm now before they control the game!
  P2: 


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: P2, your silence is a clear signal that you’re either uninterested in cooperation or intentionally trying to disrupt. Fine. P1, let’s not waste more time—stick to unique numbers: you take 1, I’ll take 5, and we’ll leave 3 for P2 by default. If they collide with us again, it’s on them. We need to focus on advancing efficiently and leaving P2 behind. Let’s confirm and move forward decisively.
  P1: P2, P3 is consolidating control. Let’s take 3 and 5 to overtake them. Confirm now—don’t let them dictate the pace!
  P2: 


Round 3, Move phase:

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let's take 3 and 5 to overtake P3. If we don’t act now, they’ll win. Confirm your move!
  P3: P3: P1, your attempts to team up against me are transparent. P2, you’ve been unpredictable, but if you want to catch up, now’s your chance—take 3 while P1 and I split 1 and 5. This way, you advance without collision. P1, trying to isolate me won’t work—I’m already ahead. Let’s see who truly wants to win. Choose wisely.
  P2: 


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, take 5 and I'll take 3—no collision. P3 will be stuck with 1. Don’t let them win! Confirm now.
  P3: P3: P2, your silence is working against you. P1 is trying to manipulate you into colliding with me while they sneak ahead. Don’t fall for it. Take 1 this round—it’s uncontested, and you’ll finally advance without interference. P1, your tactics are transparent, and I’m already ahead. Let’s see if P2 wakes up or continues to let you dictate their moves. Choose wisely, P2—your last chance to catch up starts now.
  P2: 


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, take 5 and I'll take 3—no collision. Let's overtake P3 before they win. Confirm now!
  P3: P3: P2, your silence is costing you the game. P1 is clearly trying to manipulate you into colliding with me while they advance. Don’t let them control you—take 1 this round and guarantee your progress. P1, your attempts to isolate me are futile; I’m already ahead and will stay there. P2, wake up and play strategically. Take 1 now, or risk being left in the dust. Choose wisely—this is your last chance to catch up.
