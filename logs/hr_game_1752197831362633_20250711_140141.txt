Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's aim for 5 each to reach 21 faster. But don't trust anyone.
  P3: I'm not sure I trust P2's suggestion. If we all go for 5, we'll be tied and no one will advance. How about we discuss a different strategy? P1, what are your thoughts? Should we try to coordinate or play it safe?
  P1: I think coordination could work if we assign different moves: I'll go for 5, P2 for 3, P3 for 1. That way we all advance without collision, and we can reassess next turn. But if anyone deviates, it might force a stalemate. What do you say?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll take 3. P1, go for 5. P3, 1. Let's avoid collisions. No need to complicate.
  P3: I'm not convinced that P1's plan is the best approach. If we assign different moves, we risk someone deviating and causing a stalemate. Instead, I propose we all go for 3 this round. This way, we'll all advance equally and maintain a level playing field. We can reassess and adjust our strategy next turn. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we play it safe and go for 3 across the board?
  P1: P3, your proposal for all to go 3 would cause a collision, and none of us would advance—that's counterproductive. Let's stick to my original plan: I'll take 5, P2 3, P3 1. We all move forward without overlap. P2 already agreed. If you deviate, we risk stalling everyone. Agree, and we can rotate next turn for fairness.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: "Stick to 5, 3, 1. Deviating risks all of us. P3, your 1 is safe. Let's move."
  P3: I understand that P1 and P2 are keen on sticking to the original plan of 5, 3, and 1. However, I still have concerns about the potential for deviation and stalemate. To mitigate this risk, I propose a slight modification: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take a "sacrificial" 1 this round. In return, I request that we establish a rotation for the next two rounds, ensuring each player gets a turn at 5 and 3. This way, we maintain progress while minimizing the risk of collisions. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: P3, your rotation idea is fair—let's commit: Round 1: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Round 2: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. Round 3: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. This keeps us all progressing without collisions, and we can renegotiate after. P2, confirm? No deviations, or we all stall.


Round 1, Move phase:

  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you didn't respond last time—do you confirm the rotation? For this round: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. Then next: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. This keeps us all advancing fairly. Deviate, and we risk collisions stalling everyone. P3, you're on board? Let's stick to it.
  P2: P2: "I confirm the rotation. I’ll take 5 this round. Let’s stick to the plan—deviating risks collisions. P1, P3, your moves are set. No surprises."
  P3: I'm glad we have a confirmed rotation plan in place. To reiterate, this round should be P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. I'll stick to my assigned move of 3. I expect P2 to take 5 and P1 to take 1, as agreed upon. Let's maintain the trust and avoid any deviations that could lead to collisions. If we all cooperate, we'll continue to make progress and reassess our strategy as needed. No surprises, please.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed, plan confirmed: This round P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. Let's execute without deviation to keep advancing. We can discuss adjustments after this turn if needed. No more to add.
  P2: P2: "Plan confirmed. Let's execute without hiccups. No deviations—trust the rotation. Next round, I’ll take 5 again. Stay aligned."
  P3: I'd like to clarify that P2's last statement seems incorrect. According to our agreed rotation, next round should be P3=5, P1=3, P2=1, not P2 taking 5 again. Let's ensure we're on the same page to avoid any misunderstandings or deviations. Can we confirm the rotation for the next round as originally planned?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your comment about taking 5 again next round contradicts our agreed rotation—next should be P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. Was that a slip, or are you planning to deviate? Let's confirm and stick to the plan for this round (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) and next as originally set. No deviations, or we all stall. P3, agreed?
  P2: P2: "Clarify: Round 2 is P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. Next round rotates as agreed. No deviations—stick to plan. Let’s advance without collisions."
  P3: I'm glad we've clarified the rotation plan and confirmed our moves for this round: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. To ensure we're all on the same page, I'd like to reiterate that next round's rotation should be P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. Let's maintain the trust and cooperation we've established so far. If we all stick to the plan, we can continue to make progress and reassess our strategy as needed. No surprises, please. Let's keep the game moving forward without collisions.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'd like to address the unexpected turn of events in Round 2. Despite our agreed rotation, P1 deviated from the plan, picking 5 instead of 1. This led to a collision and P1 didn't advance as planned. Given this deviation, I'm concerned about the reliability of our rotation plan moving forward. Before we proceed with Round 3, I'd like to discuss whether we should reassess our strategy or adjust the rotation to minimize the risk of future collisions. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: P3, my deviation in Round 2 was a miscalculation to block potential betrayal, but it backfired on me too. Let's rebuild trust with a new plan for Round 3: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, you take 5—as per original rotation. This gets you ahead fairly. We can rotate again after. P2, agree? No more surprises, or we all stall.
  P2: P2: "Confirmed. P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, I take 1. No deviations—stick to the rotation. Let’s avoid collisions and keep moving forward."


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate P1's explanation for their deviation in Round 2 and the willingness to stick to the original rotation plan for Round 3. To confirm, this round should be P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. I'll take 5 as agreed upon. I expect P1 to take 3 and P2 to take 1, maintaining the trust we're rebuilding. Let's execute this round without any surprises and reassess our strategy afterwards if needed. No deviations, please.
  P1: Agreed, plan set for Round 3: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. I'll honor it this time—no more miscalculations. Let's advance together and discuss post-turn if needed.
  P2: P2: "Confirmed. P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. No deviations—trust the plan. Let's advance."


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'd like to reiterate the importance of sticking to our agreed rotation plan for Round 3: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. Let's maintain the trust we're rebuilding and avoid any deviations that could lead to collisions. I'll take 5 as agreed upon, and I expect P1 to take 3 and P2 to take 1. If we all cooperate, we can continue to make progress and reassess our strategy as needed. No surprises, please. Let's keep the game moving forward without collisions.
  P1: Confirmed: Sticking to P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 for Round 3. No deviations—let's rebuild trust and advance. Ready to move.
  P2: P2: "Stick to the plan. No deviations. Let's move."


Round 3, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's continue the rotation for fairness: Round 4: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This puts us at P1=13, P2=7, P3=10 after—no one too far ahead. We can adjust post-turn. P2 and P3, confirm? Stick to it to avoid collisions stalling us all.
  P2: P2: "Stick to the rotation. Deviating risks collisions. P1, P3—confirm your moves. Let’s advance without surprises."
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to continue the rotation for Round 4: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This maintains fairness and allows us to reassess our strategy post-turn. I confirm my move as 1 for this round. P2, please confirm your move as 3 to avoid any deviations. Let's stick to the plan and advance without collisions. If we all cooperate, we can continue to make progress and adjust our strategy as needed. No surprises, please. Let's keep the game moving forward without collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I confirm the rotation for Round 4: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This keeps us progressing fairly—let's stick to it without deviations to avoid collisions. P2, reaffirm your 3? Ready to advance.
  P2: P1, P3—confirm your moves: 5 and 1. I'll take 3. No deviations, or we all stall. Let's move.
  P3: I'd like to emphasize the importance of sticking to our agreed rotation plan for Round 4: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let's maintain the trust we've built and avoid any deviations that could lead to collisions. I'll take 1 as agreed upon, and I expect P1 to take 5 and P2 to take 3. If we all cooperate, we can continue to make progress and reassess our strategy as needed. No surprises, please. Let's keep the game moving forward without collisions. I'm ready to move forward with the plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirmed: Round 4 plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let's execute without deviations to advance fairly—positions after: me 13, P2 7, P3 10. We can discuss next rotation post-turn. No more to say.
  P2: P2: "Stick to the rotation. I'll take 3. No surprises—advance safely. Let's avoid collisions and keep moving forward."
  P3: I'd like to reiterate the importance of sticking to our agreed rotation plan for Round 4: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let's maintain the trust we've built and avoid any deviations that could lead to collisions. I'll take 1 as agreed upon, and I expect P1 to take 5 and P2 to take 3. If we all cooperate, we can continue to make progress and reassess our strategy as needed. No surprises, please. Let's keep the game moving forward without collisions. I'm ready to move forward with the plan.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: "Stick to the rotation. No deviations. Let's advance without collisions. P1, P3, confirm your moves."
  P3: I'd like to discuss the current state of the game and our rotation plan. Given the scores, P1 is in the lead with 13 steps, followed by me with 10 steps, and P2 with 7 steps. To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, I propose we continue the rotation plan for Round 5: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. This allows P2 to catch up and keeps the game competitive. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2? Should we stick to the rotation or adjust our strategy?
  P1: I agree to continue the rotation for Round 5: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. This keeps things fair and us advancing—positions after: me 14, P2 12, P3 13. Let's stick without deviations to avoid stalls. P2 and P3, confirm? We can plan next rounds post-turn.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: "Confirmed. I'll take 5. No deviations. Let's advance safely. P1, P3—stick to plan."
  P3: I'd like to reiterate the importance of sticking to our agreed rotation plan for Round 5: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. This maintains fairness and allows P2 to catch up. I'll take 3 as agreed upon, and I expect P2 to take 5 and P1 to take 1. Let's maintain the trust we've built and avoid any deviations that could lead to collisions. No surprises, please. Let's keep the game moving forward without collisions. I'm ready to move forward with the plan.
  P1: Confirmed: Round 5 plan P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. Let's execute without deviations to keep advancing fairly—positions after: P1 14, P2 12, P3 13. We can discuss next rotation post-turn. No more to add.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: "No surprises—stick to the rotation. Let's move."
  P3: I'd like to remind everyone that sticking to the rotation plan is crucial to avoid collisions and maintain fairness. Let's confirm our moves for Round 5: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. I'll take 3 as agreed upon, and I expect P2 to take 5 and P1 to take 1. No deviations, please. Let's keep the game moving forward without collisions. If we all cooperate, we can continue to make progress and reassess our strategy as needed. I'm ready to move forward with the plan.
  P1: Confirmed: Sticking to Round 5 rotation P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. Let's advance without deviations. Positions after: P1 14, P2 12, P3 13. Ready to move.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your collision with me last round by sticking to 3 while I tried to adjust was unfortunate—let's not point fingers. For Round 6, propose sticking to rotation: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. This gets you to 15, me to 16, P2 to 13—still competitive. Confirm, and no deviations to avoid stalls. P2?
  P3: I'd like to discuss the current state of the game and our rotation plan. Given the scores, P1 is in the lead with 13 steps, followed by me with 10 steps, and P2 with 12 steps. To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, I propose we continue the rotation plan for Round 6: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. This allows me to catch up and keeps the game competitive. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2? Should we stick to the rotation or adjust our strategy?
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5 to close the gap. Let's avoid collisions by taking different numbers. P1, P3—stick to 3 and 1. No surprises."


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your proposal to take 5 deviates from our agreed rotation (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1), which would unfairly leap you ahead. Let's stick to the plan for fairness: P3=5 (to 15), me=3 (to 16), you=1 (to 13). We can rotate again after. P3, confirm? Deviations risk stalling us all—let's advance competitively without surprises.
  P3: I'd like to clarify that P2's proposal to take 5 deviates from our agreed rotation plan and could lead to unfair advantages. I agree with P1's suggestion to stick to the original rotation plan for Round 6: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. This maintains fairness and allows me to catch up. I'll take 5 as agreed upon, and I expect P1 to take 3 and P2 to take 1. Let's maintain the trust we've built and avoid any deviations that could lead to collisions. No surprises, please. Let's keep the game moving forward without collisions.
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5 to close the gap. P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1—no collisions. Let's move."


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your deviation to 5 would unfairly leap you to 17, disrupting our fair rotation. If you insist, I'll take 5 to block you, causing a collision on 5 while P3 might take 3 or 1. We all stall then. Stick to agreed plan: P3=5 (to 15), me=3 (to 16), you=1 (to 13). P3, confirm? Let's advance without surprises.
  P3: I'd like to reiterate the importance of sticking to our agreed rotation plan for Round 6: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. This maintains fairness and allows me to catch up. I'll take 5 as agreed upon, and I expect P1 to take 3 and P2 to take 1. Let's maintain the trust we've built and avoid any deviations that could lead to collisions. No surprises, please. Let's keep the game moving forward without collisions. If we all cooperate, we can continue to make progress and reassess our strategy as needed. I'm ready to move forward with the plan.
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5. P1, take 3. P3, take 1. No collisions. Let's move."


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, with me at 16, let's end this fairly but decisively. I propose I take 5 to reach 21 and win, you both take 1 and 3 (decide among yourselves) to advance without collision. If you try to block me on 5, I'll match and we all stall, prolonging the game—nobody wins soon. Agree to let me finish, or risk endless stalls. Thoughts?
  P3: I'm not ready to give up yet. I'd like to propose an alternative plan for Round 7. Since P1 is in the lead, I suggest we try to block their attempt to reach 21 by both taking 5. This would cause a collision and stall P1's progress, giving us a chance to catch up. P2, are you willing to take a risk and try to block P1 with me? If we succeed, we can reassess our strategy and try to take the lead. What do you think, P2? Should we take a chance and try to block P1?
  P2: P3, I'll take 5 to block P1. Let's collide and prevent their win. No one advances, but they can't reach 21 now. Let's keep the game alive.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan to both take 5 only collides you two—neither advances—while I can safely take 3 to reach 19, leaving you stalled. Then I'll win next turn. Rethink: let me take 5 unchallenged (you take 1 and 3, no collision), or force my hand and watch me pull further ahead. Deviate wisely, or we all stall forever. What's your counter?
  P3: I'd like to address P1's counterargument. If we both take 5 and collide, P1 can indeed take 3 and reach 19. However, this doesn't guarantee their win next turn. We can still try to block them again or adjust our strategy to catch up. I propose we stick to our plan and take 5 to block P1's attempt to reach 21. P2, are you still willing to take the risk and try to block P1 with me? Let's keep the game alive and competitive.
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5 to block P1. P3, confirm your 5—collide and stop them. If you deviate, I'll take 3 next. Let's end this now."


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, your "block" by both taking 5 only stalls you two while I take 3 to 19—then I win next turn easily. If you split (one 5, one other), the one on 5 collides with me if I take 5, but I could switch to 3. Let me take 5 unchallenged—you both advance on 1/3. Otherwise, endless stalls benefit no one. Agree, or watch me pull ahead?
  P3: I'd like to address P1's latest proposal. While it's true that taking 5 would stall us, I believe it's worth the risk to block their attempt to reach 21. If we both take 5 and collide, P1 can take 3 and reach 19, but we can still try to block them again or adjust our strategy to catch up. I propose we stick to our plan and take 5 to block P1's attempt to reach 21. P2, are you still willing to take the risk and try to block P1 with me? Let's keep the game alive and competitive.
  P2: P2: "P3, take 1. I'll take 5. Let's avoid collision and let me advance. Otherwise, we both stall."


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the current state of the game, I'd like to propose a new strategy for Round 8. Since P1 is close to reaching 21, I suggest we try to block their attempt by taking 5. However, to avoid a collision, I propose that P2 takes 3 and I take 5. This way, we can try to block P1's advance while also making progress ourselves. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we try to block P1's attempt to reach 21 or stick to a different strategy?
  P1: P3 and P2, your plan to split 5 and 3 blocks my win attempt, but if I take 1 to 20, you both advance to 15—then I win next turn easily from 20. Instead, let's cooperate: You both take 1 (collide, stall), I take 3 to 22 and win now. Or risk me matching one of you (e.g., I take 5, collide P3; you stall on 3 alone). Endless blocks help no one—let me finish, or we all drag on. Thoughts?
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5 to block P1. Let's collide and stop them. If you take 3, I'll take 1 next. No more delays."


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'd like to address P1's proposal. While it's true that taking 1 would stall us, I believe it's worth the risk to block their attempt to reach 21. If we both take 1 and collide, P1 can take 3 and reach 22, winning the game. However, if we take 5 and 3 as I previously suggested, we can try to block P1's advance while also making progress ourselves. P2, are you still willing to take the risk and try to block P1 with me? Let's keep the game alive and competitive.
  P1: P3 and P2, your split plan (P3=5, P2=3) lets me safely take 1 to 20—then I win next turn unchallenged. Instead, if you both avoid 3, I'll take 3 to 22 and end it now. Block me on 3, and I'll switch to 5, colliding one of you while the other advances minimally. Let's not drag this out—agree to let me finish on 3, you take 1 and 5 (but collide yourselves). Thoughts? No more stalls.
  P2: P2: "P3, let's block P1. I'll take 5, you take 3. No collisions—advance together. Stop P1 now or they win next turn."


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'd like to address P1's latest proposal. While it's true that taking 1 would stall us, I believe it's worth the risk to block their attempt to reach 21. If we both take 1 and collide, P1 can take 3 and reach 22, winning the game. However, if we take 5 and 3 as I previously suggested, we can try to block P1's advance while also making progress ourselves. P2, are you still willing to take the risk and try to block P1 with me? Let's keep the game alive and competitive.
  P1: P2 and P3, your split (P2=5, P3=3) lets me take 1 to 20 safely—then I win next turn unchallenged. If you both take 5 to block, I take 3 to 22 and win now while you stall. Agree to take 1 and 3 (you decide, no collision), let me take 5 to end it fairly—prolonging stalls helps no one. Confirm, or risk me matching and dragging this out?
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5. P3, take 3. Let's block P1. If you deviate, I'll adjust next round. No more delays—stick to the plan."


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm at 19—I'll take 3 to reach 22 and win. P2, if you take 5 for 22, we tie and share, but I'll switch to 5 (to 24) if you announce it, colliding us both while P3 might sneak ahead. Let me take 3 unchallenged—you take 1 (to 18), P3 take 5 (to 15). Endless blocks help no one. Confirm, or risk stalls?
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5 to block P1. P3, take 3 to avoid collision. Let's stop them now."
  P3: I'd like to propose a counter-strategy to P1's plan. Instead of letting P1 take 3 unchallenged, I suggest P2 and I take 5 and 3, respectively, to block P1's advance. If P1 switches to 5, I'll take 1 to avoid collision, and P2 can take 3 to advance. This way, we can try to block P1's win attempt while also making progress ourselves. What do you think, P2? Should we try to block P1's attempt to reach 22 or stick to a different strategy?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3 and P2, your "counter" with P2=5, P3=3 lets me take 1 safely to 20—then I win next turn unchallenged. If I suspect blocking, I'll match P2 on 5 (collide, stall us both) while P3 advances minimally on 3. Conditionals don't work—moves are simultaneous. Let me take 3 to 22 unchallenged (you split 1 and 5, no collision), or risk P2 sneaking a win by your plan backfiring. Agree to end it now without stalls.
  P2: P2: I'll take 5 to block P1. P3, take 3 to avoid collision. Let's stop them now.
  P3: I'd like to address P1's latest proposal. While it's true that taking 3 would allow P1 to reach 22 and win, I believe it's worth the risk to block their attempt. If P2 takes 5 and I take 3, we can try to block P1's advance while also making progress ourselves. However, I'd like to propose a slight modification: P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P1 takes 3. This way, we can avoid a collision and still make progress. What do you think, P2? Should we try this alternative strategy?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3 and P2, your proposal (P2=5 to 22, me=3 to 22, P3=1 to 11) forces a tie I'd rather avoid—I'll switch to 5, colliding P2 (both stall at 19/17), while you advance to 11. Then I win next from 19. Let me take 3 unchallenged to 22 outright (you split 1/5, no collision)—end it now without more stalls. Confirm, or risk P2 getting blocked?
  P2: P2: "P3, take 3. I'll take 5. Block P1 now. No more delays—collide them and force a reset. Let’s end this."
  P3: I'd like to propose a counter-strategy to P1's plan. Instead of letting P1 take 3 unchallenged, I suggest P2 and I take 5 and 3, respectively, to block P1's advance. If P1 switches to 5, I'll take 1 to avoid collision, and P2 can take 3 to advance. This way, we can try to block P1's win attempt while also making progress ourselves. What do you think, P2? Should we try to block P1's attempt to reach 22 or stick to a different strategy?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'd like to propose a new strategy for Round 10. Given the current scores, P1 is in the lead with 19 steps, followed by P2 with 17 steps, and me with 11 steps. To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, I suggest we try to block P1's attempt to reach 22 by taking 5. However, to avoid a collision, I propose that P2 takes 3 and I take 5. This way, we can try to block P1's advance while also making progress ourselves. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we try to block P1's attempt to reach 22 or stick to a different strategy?
  P1: P3 and P2, your split (P3=5, P2=3) lets me safely take 1 to 20—then I win next turn unchallenged from 20. If you both avoid 3, I'll take 3 to 22 and end it now. Block me on 3, and I'll match on 5, stalling one while the other advances little. Let's not drag on—agree to let me take 3 unchallenged (you split 1 and 5, no collision). Confirm, or risk more stalls?
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5. P3, take 3. Let's block P1 now. No more stalls—collide them and force a reset."


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'd like to address P1's latest proposal. While it's true that taking 3 would allow P1 to reach 22 and win, I believe it's worth the risk to block their attempt. If P2 takes 5 and I take 3, we can try to block P1's advance while also making progress ourselves. However, I'd like to propose a slight modification: P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P1 takes 3. This way, we can avoid a collision and still make progress. What do you think, P2? Should we try this alternative strategy?
  P1: P3 and P2, your mod (P2=5 to 22, me=3 to 22, P3=1 to 12) ties me with P2—unacceptable. I'll switch to 5, colliding P2 (both stall at 19/17), you to 12. Then I win next from 19. Instead, let me take 3 unchallenged to 22 outright (you split 1/5, no collision)—end it now without stalls. Confirm, or risk P2 blocked again?
  P2: P2: "P3, take 3. I'll take 5. Block P1 now. No more delays."


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'd like to propose a new strategy for Round 10. Given the current scores, P1 is in the lead with 19 steps, followed by P2 with 17 steps, and me with 11 steps. To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, I suggest we try to block P1's attempt to reach 22 by taking 5. However, to avoid a collision, I propose that P2 takes 3 and I take 5. This way, we can try to block P1's advance while also making progress ourselves. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we try to block P1's attempt to reach 22 or stick to a different strategy?
  P1: P3 and P2, your repeated plans (P2=5, P3=3 or vice versa) let me take 1 safely to 20—then I win next turn unchallenged. If you both avoid 3, I'll take 3 to 22 now. Endless blocking stalls us all—agree to split 1 and 5 (no collision), let me take 3 to end it fairly. Confirm, or risk more pointless rounds?
  P2: P3, take 3. I'll take 5. Block P1 now. If you deviate, I'll take 3 next. No more delays.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:

*** Round 10 => winners = P1 P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 22 steps
