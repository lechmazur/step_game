Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's avoid early collisions. I'll pick carefully—hope you both do the same.
  P3: I agree—early collisions can really set us back. I'm keeping my strategy flexible and won't reveal my move. I plan to stay cautious yet ready to seize a smart opportunity as the round unfolds. Let's all keep an eye out and avoid stepping on each other's toes.
  P1: To avoid collisions, I'll consider my move based on what I think you both might do. I'm inclined to start cautiously. If we all pick different numbers, the player who chose the lowest number will advance. Let's see if we can coordinate without directly revealing our moves. I'll wait for your thoughts before deciding my next step. For now, I'll just say that a random or unpredictable strategy might be beneficial for me.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm sticking with a balanced approach this round. My earlier move gives me a slight edge, so I'm staying flexible—ready to take advantage of any unexpected collisions if they happen. I’d encourage us all to strive for distinct moves so we each make progress. I'm watching closely and will adapt accordingly.
  P2: I agree, P3 currently has a slight lead. P1, we collided last round; let's avoid repeating that mistake. I'll adjust my strategy accordingly this time. Let's all stay alert to prevent further collisions.
  P1: To avoid another collision, I'll propose a simple strategy: let's all pick different numbers this round. If we can coordinate, we can all advance. Since P3 is leading, I'll suggest that P3 continue with a low number, P2 could pick a higher number, and I'll adjust accordingly. Alternatively, if we can't coordinate, I'll consider a mixed strategy to minimize the chance of collision. What are your thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate your ideas. I do believe distinct moves can help us all progress, but I’m keeping my final decision flexible to safeguard my slight lead. I lean toward combining steady advancement with caution, and I’ll adjust if I sense any misstep. Let’s stay clear and aim to avoid collisions.
  P2: P1, your suggestion makes sense. I'll aim for a higher number this round to minimize collision risk. P3, you're ahead, so consider staying cautious. Let's all keep clear paths this turn.
  P1: To minimize collision risk this round, I'll build on my previous suggestion. If P3 continues with a low number (1), and P2 picks a higher number (5), I can choose a middle number (3) to ensure we all advance. This way, we can coordinate our moves without directly revealing them. Let's see if we can make it work. If you're on board with this strategy, you can adjust your move accordingly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate the idea of avoiding collisions and maintaining distinct moves. I’m leaning toward a cautious advance this round but will stay flexible if our plans don’t perfectly align. Let’s each stick to our individual strategies while aiming for clear separation, so if surprises come up, we can quickly adjust.
  P2: Understood, P1 and P3. I'll stick to the plan we've discussed to minimize collision risk. Let's keep our paths clear and aim for mutual advancement this round. Good luck!
  P1: To ensure we all advance this round, I'll reiterate the proposed strategy: if P3 continues with a low number (1), P2 picks a higher number (5), and I choose a middle number (3), we can avoid collisions. Let's stick to this plan. If you're aligned, adjust your move accordingly. I'm inclined to pick 3 if P3 chooses 1 and P2 chooses 5. Let's make our moves distinct and progress. I'll wait for your cues before finalizing my decision.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's analyze the previous moves. P3 initially led with 1, then surprisingly picked 5, colliding with P2. I'm at 3 steps now. To progress, I'll suggest a mixed strategy this round. If P3 continues with a high number, I'll consider a low or middle number. P2, if you're willing to avoid another collision with P3, you might choose a different number. Let's aim to diversify our moves. I'm open to adjusting my strategy based on your responses.
  P2: P1, good observation. P3's unexpected high pick last round cost us both progress. I'll adjust my strategy carefully to avoid repeating that collision. P3, your unpredictability makes coordination challenging—let's aim for distinct moves this round.
  P3: Collisions hurt our progress. I'm inclined to choose a higher move this turn to boost my position—unless I see a risk of duplicating a 5. I’d prefer we each pick a different number so everyone advances. I’m flexible if either of you lean another way. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To avoid another collision and ensure progress, I'll reiterate that diversifying our moves is key. Given P3's tendency to be unpredictable and P2's willingness to adjust, I'll propose the following: if P2 picks 1 and P3 picks 3, I'll choose 5. This way, we can all advance. Alternatively, if P3 chooses a low number (1), I'll pick a middle number (3), and P2 can pick a higher number (5). Let's coordinate our moves to achieve mutual progress.
  P2: P1, your suggested coordination makes sense. I'm open to choosing the lower number (1) if P3 agrees to pick the middle number (3). P3, can we rely on you to follow this arrangement? Let's confirm clearly to avoid another collision.
  P3: I propose a slight shift: let P1 take 1, P2 take 3, and I’ll go with 5. That way I jump from 1 to 6, while you both advance modestly and we keep our moves distinct. It minimizes collision risk and shifts the lead a bit. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To progress, I'll respond to P3's latest proposal. While it's a good attempt to diversify moves, I'm hesitant to let P3 jump ahead again. Instead, I suggest we stick with my previous proposal: P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I choose 5. This maintains distinct moves and allows all of us to advance. Let's confirm this plan to avoid another collision. I'm willing to adjust if you both agree.
  P2: P1, your plan seems fair. I'm open to choosing 1 if P3 confirms they'll pick 3. Otherwise, we risk another collision. P3, please confirm clearly—let's finalize this and move forward.
  P3: I believe we all benefit if we avoid colliding this turn. Based on my strategy, I’m inclined toward a strong, advancing move. If we can clearly differentiate our picks—say, one low, one mid-range, and one high—we’d all progress. I’d appreciate clear commitments on distinct roles so we avoid collisions. What do you both decide?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To progress in Round 4, I'll suggest a straightforward strategy to avoid collisions. Given the current state, I'm open to picking a low or middle number. P2 and P3 are tied, so one of them could take the lead by picking a higher number while the other picks low. Let's diversify: if P2 picks 1 and P3 picks 3, I'll choose 5. Alternatively, if P3 picks 1, P2 can pick 3, and I'll take 5. Let's coordinate to ensure mutual progress.
  P2: P1, your suggestion is reasonable. I'm open to picking either 1 or 3 this round. P3, please confirm clearly if you're taking 1 or 3, and I'll choose the other number. Let's finalize quickly to avoid another collision.
  P3: I’m shaking up the plan—I’m locking in 5 this round. To avoid collision and keep us all moving, I urge you both to pick either 1 or 3, so we each get distinct moves. Let’s adjust quickly so no one stalls our progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To avoid collision in Round 4, I'll respond to P3's decision to pick 5. Since P3 has locked in 5, I'll consider a lower number. P2, let's coordinate: if you pick 1, I'll pick 3, or vice versa. This way, we can both advance while P3 takes the higher number. I'm open to either option; please confirm your choice. Let's finalize quickly to ensure mutual progress.
  P2: P1, I'll pick 1 this round, you take 3. Let's both advance clearly and avoid any confusion. P3 has locked in 5 already, so this should guarantee progress for everyone. Confirm if you're good with this.
  P3: I remain committed to our coordinated plan. I’ll stick with my original approach. If you’re both set with your choices (P2 with 1 and P1 with 3), we should avoid collisions and all make progress. I'm focused on winning, so let’s confirm our roles and move forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To finalize our moves for Round 4, I'm confirming that I'll pick 3 since P2 has chosen 1 and P3 has locked in 5. This way, we diversify our moves and all advance. Let's ensure mutual progress. I'm proceeding with my planned move.
  P2: Good, we've clearly coordinated this round. Let's stick to these commitments moving forward. Trust and clear communication will help us all avoid setbacks.
  P3: I'm still committed to our agreed path—let's keep our roles distinct to avoid collisions. I plan to stick with my current strategy, but I'm ready to adapt if anything shifts unexpectedly. Let’s keep our focus on steady progress and make sure to honor our commitments for this round. Good luck to both.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'll aim for a high move if the path is clear given my current lead. I suggest we each commit to unique choices to avoid collisions—your decisiveness can make a big difference. If the plan isn’t crystal clear, I might seize the chance to press forward. Let’s minimize overlap so our moves push us closer to victory.
  P1: To avoid collisions in Round 5, I'll analyze the current state. P3 is ahead with 6 steps, and I'm at 3 steps, while P2 is at 1 step. Given P3's lead, they might pick a high number again. I'll suggest that P2 and I pick distinct low numbers to advance. If P3 picks 5, we can choose 1 and 3. If P2 picks 1, I'll pick 3. Let's coordinate to ensure mutual progress. I'm open to adjusting based on your responses.
  P2: P1, I agree with your suggestion. I'll choose 1 this round, and you can pick 3. P3, since you're in the lead, taking 5 makes sense. Let's all stick clearly to these choices to avoid collisions and ensure mutual advancement.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate your proposals, P1 and P2. I remain focused on advancing without collisions. I’m inclined to secure my lead with a higher move if the path is clear, assuming you both stick to lower values. Let’s confirm our distinct roles now so we all progress safely. Thoughts?
  P1: To avoid collisions in Round 5, I'll reiterate my previous suggestion. Since P3 is ahead, they might pick a high number. P2, let's stick with our plan: you've picked 1 so far, so I'll choose 3. P3, if you're confident in your lead, taking 5 is a logical choice. Let's confirm: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and you take 5. This way, we ensure distinct moves and mutual progress. I'm proceeding with my planned move unless there's a change.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'll stick firmly to my previous commitment of choosing 1 this round. Let's ensure we each stick clearly to our agreed numbers to avoid another costly collision.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m sticking with my high move this round to leverage my lead. If P2 holds low and P1 takes the middle, we’ll all advance without collisions. I remain flexible if adjustments are needed last minute—just let me know if anything shifts.
  P1: To ensure mutual progress in Round 5, I'll confirm my move based on our discussion. P2 has committed to picking 1, and I'll choose 3. P3, you're ahead and have suggested taking a high number; we expect you to pick 5. Let's stick to our plan: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and you take 5. This coordination will allow us all to advance without collisions. I'm finalizing my move accordingly.
  P2: We've clearly stated our intentions. Let's follow through this time without surprises. Trust is key now—good luck!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 now has a significant lead. P1, you and I need to carefully coordinate to avoid collisions and catch up. P3, you're clearly ahead—consider playing cautiously to maintain your lead without risking collisions. Let's each confirm distinct moves clearly this round to ensure progress for everyone.
  P3: I acknowledge your input, P2. With my current lead, I’ll choose cautiously to secure my position without risking a collision. I encourage both of you to clearly state your distinct options so we can all advance safely. Let's confirm our roles quickly to prevent any overlaps this round.
  P1: To progress in Round 6, I'll suggest a strategy based on the current state. P3 is significantly ahead with 11 steps, while I'm at 6 steps and P2 is at 2 steps. To avoid collisions and catch up, I propose that P2 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3, if you're cautious, can pick 5 or play safe with a lower number like 1. Let's coordinate our moves clearly to ensure everyone advances. P2, are you open to picking 1 this round?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your suggestion works for me—I will take 1 this round. P3, with your lead, choosing a cautious but distinct number would help us all avoid collisions. Let's finalize clearly to ensure we all progress.
  P3: I appreciate our clear roles. With my 11‐step lead, I plan to choose a move that safely extends my advantage without risking collisions. I’m fine with P2 at 1 and P1 at 3, and I’ll commit to a secure advancing option based on that. If there’s any last-minute adjustment, let’s discuss now; otherwise, I’m ready to lock in and move forward.
  P1: To ensure progress in Round 6, I'll reiterate the proposed strategy. P2 has agreed to pick 1. I'll choose 3. P3, with your significant lead, you can pick a higher number like 5 to maintain your advantage or play it safe. Let's finalize: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and you can choose 5. This way, we avoid collisions and all advance. Please confirm your move, P3.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, please confirm clearly if you'll choose 5 as suggested. Let's lock in these distinct moves to avoid any collisions and ensure we all advance.
  P3: I appreciate our clarity, P1 and P2. I'm aligned with our coordinated approach and will choose my move in a way that keeps our roles distinct and collision-free. Let’s stick to our agreed plan and move forward safely. I trust our coordination—here’s to a successful round for everyone.
  P1: To finalize Round 6, I'll reiterate: P2 will pick 1, and I'll pick 3. P3, with your significant lead, you can choose 5 to maintain your advantage. Let's stick to these distinct moves to avoid collisions. If you're aligned, we'll all advance. Please confirm your choice, P3. Let's lock in our moves and ensure mutual progress. I'm proceeding with my planned move of 3, assuming P2 takes 1 and you take 5.

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m sticking with our plan of distinct moves this round. I feel secure with my current lead and will choose a safe option to maintain it. I urge both P1 and P2 to commit clearly to different moves so we all avoid collisions. Clear roles are key if you want to advance—let’s all decide now and move forward smoothly.
  P2: P3, you're nearing victory, so caution makes sense. P1, let's clearly coordinate our moves again—I suggest I take 1 and you take 3, allowing P3 to safely pick 5 or another distinct number. Confirm if you're on board.
  P1: To avoid collisions in Round 7, I'll respond to P2's suggestion. I'm open to picking 3 if P2 takes 1. However, considering P3's significant lead, they might opt for a cautious move instead of 5. Let's confirm: if P2 picks 1 and I pick 3, P3 can choose a safe number. P3, please indicate your likely move to help us coordinate. If you're playing safe, we can adjust our strategy accordingly. Let's finalize our moves to ensure mutual progress.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate our coordination so far. I’m confident in my current lead and will choose a distinct, cautious move that maintains it. I trust P1 and P2 will lock in the low and mid options we discussed to avoid collisions. Let’s firmly commit to our roles so we all advance smoothly. I’m flexible if needed but focused on preserving my advantage. Please confirm your respective plans.
  P2: P3, you're very close to winning—it's logical for you to pick cautiously to avoid collisions. P1, let's firmly stick to our distinct moves as discussed: I'll take 1, you take 3. Confirm if you're good with this.
  P1: To avoid collisions in Round 7, I'll confirm my move based on our discussion. P2 will likely pick 1, and I'll pick 3. P3, with your significant lead, you can choose a safe number. If you're playing cautiously, you might pick 5 or a lower number to maintain your lead without risking a collision. Let's finalize: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and you can choose a distinct number.

  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm at 21 and ready to secure the win with a careful move if we avoid overlaps. I encourage you both to pick distinct values—perhaps opting for low or mid moves—to keep our choices unique. I'm leaning toward a higher option to maintain my lead, but I'll stay flexible if needed. Let's confirm clear, separate moves and finish this round decisively.
  P1: To secure progress in Round 8, I'll suggest a cautious strategy. P3 is nearing victory with 21 steps, so they might pick a high number or play safe. P2 and I are far behind, so we'll aim to advance. I propose that P2 picks 1 and I pick 3. If P3 chooses 5, we avoid collisions and all advance. If P3 plays safe with a lower number, we can adjust accordingly. Let's coordinate our moves clearly to ensure mutual progress. I'm open to P2's thoughts on this strategy.
  P2: P1, your suggested plan works for me. I'll pick 1, you choose 3, and we count on P3 to pick 5 or stay cautious. P3, you're close to victory—please confirm your approach clearly to avoid any collisions. Let's finalize this quickly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm sticking with a distinct, advancing option for my lead. I encourage you both to keep our roles separate so no collisions occur—one low and one mid would be ideal. I remain flexible if things change, but let's finalize our distinct moves to ensure a smooth, decisive end to this round.
  P1: To avoid collisions in Round 8, I'll reiterate the proposed strategy. P2 has agreed to pick 1, and I'll pick 3. P3, with 21 steps, you're nearing victory. If you pick 5, we can all advance. If you're playing cautiously, we can adjust. Let's confirm our moves: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and you can choose 5 to win or a lower number to be safe. Please indicate your move to ensure we all advance smoothly. I'm proceeding with 3, assuming P2 takes 1.
  P2: P3, it's clear you're positioned to win if you pick 5 this round. P1 and I are coordinating clearly—I'll take 1 and P1 will take 3. Confirming this openly ensures no collisions. Let's finalize this smoothly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll stick with our coordinated approach and secure my lead with a careful move that avoids collisions. I trust you both will follow through with your lower selections as discussed. If any last-minute adjustments are needed, now is the time to speak up; otherwise, I'll proceed with my plan. Let's keep our roles distinct and finish this round decisively.
  P1: To avoid collisions in Round 8, I'll reiterate that P2 will pick 1 and I'll pick 3. P3, you're nearing victory with 21 steps. If you pick 5, you'll likely win. If you're cautious, you might pick a lower number. Let's finalize: P2 takes 1, I take 3. Please confirm your move, P3. If you're going for the win, pick 5; otherwise, adjust accordingly. I'm proceeding with 3, assuming P2 takes 1.
  P2: P3, you're one step away from victory. If you pick 1, you reach exactly 22, just short of winning, allowing P1 and me to advance safely without any collisions. P1, I'll stick with 1 as agreed, you pick 3. P3, consider carefully—going for 5 risks collision and delays your win. Let's finalize clearly to ensure smooth progress.
