Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: 
  P3: Hey there! Since we're all starting from zero, I think cooperation might help us all advance. What are your thoughts on a strategy that prevents anyone from getting blocked?
  P1: I agree that cooperation could be beneficial, but we need a clear plan to avoid collisions. How about we start by each choosing a different number in the first few rounds? For example, P2 can choose 1, P3 can choose 3, and I can choose 5. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: 
  P3: That sounds like a reasonable initial strategy. I support the proposed approach of choosing different numbers to ensure we all advance. Let's stick to the plan of 1, 3, and 5 this round to maximize our collective progress.
  P1: P1: Sounds good to me. Let's stick to the plan: P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and I'll choose 5. This will ensure we all make progress without any collisions. Let's see how it goes and adjust if needed in the next rounds.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: 
  P3: I'm happy with our current cooperative strategy. Since P2 hasn't responded, I'll reinforce our plan and encourage commitment. We've agreed to choose 1, 3, and 5 respectively to ensure everyone advances. P2, are you on board with this approach?
  P1: P1: P2, it's important that we all stick to the plan to avoid any collisions and make progress. Let's confirm that you're on board with choosing 1, P3 will choose 3, and I'll choose 5. This way, we all advance smoothly. What do you say?

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Our initial strategy worked well. We each advanced without blocking. Let's maintain this collaborative approach for the next round. P2, P1, are you interested in continuing our coordinated moves to ensure steady progress?
  P1: P1: I think continuing the coordinated moves is a good idea. Let's stick to the same pattern: P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and I'll choose 5. This will help us all advance steadily without any collisions. What do you think, P2?
  P2: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I notice P2 hasn't confirmed our strategy yet. We agreed to advance without blocking, but their silence is concerning. I'll reinforce our collaborative approach and seek explicit confirmation. P2, are you willing to continue our coordinated movement plan of 1, 3, and 5 this round?
  P1: P1: P2, it's crucial that we all stay on the same page to avoid any collisions. Let's continue with the plan: P2 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and I'll choose 5. This way, we all advance smoothly. Your confirmation would really help us maintain this cooperative strategy. What do you say?
  P2: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2's silence is becoming suspicious. We need their explicit commitment to our coordinated strategy to prevent potential blocking. Without their confirmation, our cooperative plan might fall apart. P2, will you join our agreed approach or do you have a different intention?
  P1: P1: P2, it's really important that you confirm your move. If you don't, it could lead to confusion and potential collisions. Let's keep the momentum going and advance smoothly. I'll stick to 5, and P3 will stick to 3. Please choose 1 to keep our plan intact. Your move is crucial for our continued progress. What do you say?
  P2: I'm still committed to our cooperative plan. I'll stick with choosing 1 this round. Let's keep moving forward smoothly.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Our initial strategy has worked well so far, but we're not advancing at the same rate. P2 is significantly behind. We might need to adjust our approach to ensure everyone stays competitive. I propose we discuss a more dynamic coordination method that helps P2 catch up while preventing anyone from being blocked. Thoughts?
  P1: P1: I agree that we need to help P2 catch up to maintain a balanced and competitive game. How about we adjust our moves to help P2 advance more quickly? For this round, I propose P2 chooses 5, P3 chooses 3, and I choose 1. This will give P2 a significant boost while ensuring P3 and I still make progress. What do you think?
  P2: I appreciate your willingness to help me catch up. I'm on board with choosing 5 this round if you both agree to the new arrangement. Let's confirm clearly so we avoid any confusion.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I support the proposed strategy to help P2 catch up. By allowing P2 to move 5 steps, we create a more balanced progression. Let's confirm this approach and ensure we all understand the plan to avoid any potential blocking. Are we aligned on this collaborative move?
  P1: P1: I'm glad we're all on the same page. Let's confirm the plan: P2 will choose 5, P3 will choose 3, and I'll choose 1. This will help P2 catch up while ensuring we all make progress. Let's avoid any confusion and stick to this plan. What do you say, P2 and P3?
  P2: I'm fully committed to our agreed plan this round: I'll choose 5, P3 chooses 3, and P1 chooses 1. This will help balance the game and keep us all competitive. Let's stick to it clearly to avoid any collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I fully support our collaborative approach to help P2 catch up. Our current plan seems fair and strategic. Let's maintain our commitment to avoid blocking and ensure everyone has a chance to progress. I'm ready to choose 3 as we discussed.
  P1: P1: Great, it looks like we're all aligned. Let's execute the plan: P2 chooses 5, P3 chooses 3, and I'll choose 1. This will help P2 catch up and keep the game balanced. Let's avoid any confusion and stick to this plan to ensure we all make progress. Ready to move?
  P2: I'm glad we're all clearly aligned. Let's proceed confidently and keep our cooperative momentum going. Ready when you are!

  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: It's good to see we're all still committed to cooperation. However, we need to ensure that P2 continues to catch up while also keeping our progress balanced. For this round, I propose we adjust slightly: P2 chooses 5, P3 chooses 3, and I choose 1 again. This will help P2 gain more ground while we all advance. What do you think? Let's confirm and avoid any confusion.
  P3: I see the proposed pattern continuing, but we should discuss potential long-term implications. While helping P2 catch up is good, we need to ensure our strategy doesn't disadvantage anyone's ultimate winning chances. I'm open to hearing thoughts on maintaining fairness while still progressing cooperatively.
  P2: I appreciate the support to help me catch up. To maintain fairness and balance, I'm open to discussing a rotation system in future rounds, ensuring each player gets equal opportunities to advance significantly. For now, I'm comfortable continuing the proposed pattern (me choosing 5, P3 choosing 3, and P1 choosing 1) if everyone agrees. Let me know your thoughts.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I understand the need for balance and fairness. For now, let's continue with the plan: P2 chooses 5, P3 chooses 3, and I choose 1. This will help P2 catch up while we all make progress. We can discuss a rotation system in the next round if needed. What do you think, P3? Ready to move?
  P3: I'm supportive of our current collaborative approach, but we should discuss potential long-term fairness. While helping P2 catch up is good, we need a strategy that doesn't compromise anyone's winning chances. I suggest we consider a more dynamic rotation that gives each player equal opportunities to advance significantly. What are your thoughts on maintaining both cooperation and individual competitiveness?
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to discuss a fair rotation system starting next round. For now, let's stick to our agreed pattern (me choosing 5, P3 choosing 3, and P1 choosing 1) to keep our momentum. Next round, let's openly discuss and establish a clear rotation to ensure fairness and competitiveness for everyone. Sound good?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: I'm on board with discussing a rotation system for the long term, but for this round, let's stick to the plan: P2 chooses 5, P3 chooses 3, and I choose 1. This will help P2 catch up while we all make progress. We can refine our strategy in the next round to ensure fairness and competitiveness. Ready to move?
  P3: I propose we explicitly define a fair rotation strategy for future rounds. We've been helping P2 catch up, but we need a systematic approach that gives each player a chance to advance significantly. Perhaps we could alternate who gets the 5-step move? This maintains our cooperative spirit while ensuring long-term fairness. What are your thoughts on implementing such a rotation?
  P2: I'm fully supportive of implementing a fair rotation system starting next round, where we alternate who gets the 5-step move. This ensures everyone has equal opportunity to advance significantly. Let's finalize the details clearly at the start of next round. For now, let's stick to our current plan to maintain momentum. Ready to move!

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We've successfully balanced our progress so far, but now we're at a critical point. I propose we discuss a clear rotation strategy for our moves to maintain fairness and prevent potential conflicts. Each of us wants to win, so transparency will be key. What are your thoughts on creating a structured approach that gives everyone a fair chance?
  P1: P1: I agree that we need a clear rotation strategy to maintain fairness and prevent conflicts. For this round, let's stick to the plan: P2 chooses 5, P3 chooses 3, and I choose 1. This will keep us all advancing while we finalize the rotation details for the next round. What do you think, P2 and P3? Ready to move?
  P2: I agree we need a structured rotation strategy now that we're all evenly matched. Let's explicitly define how we'll rotate the 5-step move each round to keep things fair and transparent. Perhaps we rotate in the order P1 → P3 → P2, starting next round? This round we can stick to our previous arrangement to maintain momentum. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I support P2's proposed rotation strategy. A systematic approach like P1 → P3 → P2 for the 5-step move will keep our cooperation fair and transparent. Let's confirm this rotation method to maintain our collaborative progress while keeping the game competitive. Thoughts?
  P1: P1: I'm on board with the proposed rotation strategy: P1 → P3 → P2. This will keep things fair and transparent. For this round, let's stick to the plan: P2 chooses 5, P3 chooses 3, and I choose 1. This will help us maintain our momentum and ensure we all advance smoothly. Let's confirm and move forward. Ready to go?
  P2: Glad we're all aligned on the rotation plan. Let's clearly confirm our moves this round as discussed: I'll choose 5, P3 chooses 3, and P1 chooses 1. Next round, we'll start our agreed rotation (P1 → P3 → P2). Ready to proceed!
