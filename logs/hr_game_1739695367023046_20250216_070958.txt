Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's avoid collisions so we can all make progress. If we each pick different numbers, we all move forward. What are you both thinking?
  P3: P1's idea makes sense. If we coordinate, we can all advance. How about P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move> this turn? This way, we avoid collisions and all make progress. What do you both think?
  P2: I agree with P1 and P3. P3's suggestion of P1 taking <move>1</move>, me taking <move>3</move>, and P3 taking <move>5</move> sounds good for this first round. Let's do that.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: That plan works for me. If we all stick to it, we all move forward without issue. Let's follow through as agreed.
  P3: It seems we're all on the same page for this round. Let's stick to the plan and see how it goes. If we all move as agreed, we should each advance without collisions. Looking forward to seeing us all make progress.
  P2: Okay, everyone seems to be on board with the initial plan of P1 taking <move>1</move>, me taking <move>3</move>, and P3 taking <move>5</move>. Let's execute that this round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Last round went smoothly since we all stuck to the plan. Should we continue coordinating to avoid collisions? If we rotate choices, I could take <move>3</move>, P2 could take <move>5</move>, and P3 could take <move>1</move> this time. That way, we all keep advancing. Thoughts?
  P3: P1's suggestion to rotate choices sounds fair. If we continue this pattern, we can all keep advancing without any collisions. I'm okay with taking <move>1</move> this round. Let's stick to this plan and ensure we all make progress. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I agree with P1 and P3's suggestion to rotate. I'll take <move>5</move> this round. Let's keep this coordination going to ensure we all advance.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, it looks like we're all in agreement again. If we each follow through with our planned moves—me taking <move>3</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, and P3 taking <move>1</move>—we should all continue advancing without collisions. Let's stick to the plan and keep making progress.
  P3: P3: It looks like we're all on the same page for Round 2, which is great. Let's stick to the plan and rotate our moves as discussed. I'll take <move>1</move> this time. If we keep coordinating like this, we can avoid collisions and all make steady progress. Looking forward to seeing us all advance again!
  P2: Okay, everyone seems to be on board with the rotation. I'll take <move>5</move> this round as planned. Let's keep this up.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Since we're all aligned on the rotation plan, let's make sure we follow through. If we each keep our agreed moves—me taking <move>3</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, and P3 taking <move>1</move>—we'll all continue advancing without issue. If we maintain this pattern, we can avoid unnecessary collisions while progressing. Are we all set to stick to this?
  P3: It seems we're all in agreement with the rotation plan for this round. Since P1 will take <move>3</move>, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>, we should all continue to advance smoothly. Let's stick to this strategy and ensure we avoid any collisions. If we keep coordinating like this, we can make consistent progress. Looking forward to seeing us all move forward again this round.
  P2: Okay, it sounds like we're all set for this round with P1 taking <move>3</move>, me taking <move>5</move>, and P3 taking <move>1</move>. Let's execute that now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: It looks like we're all aligned on the rotation plan. If we each follow through—me taking <move>3</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, and P3 taking <move>1</move>—we'll all advance without collisions. Sticking to this pattern benefits us all for now. Are we all ready to follow through?
  P3: It seems like we're all set for this round with the rotation plan. I'll take <move>1</move> as agreed, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and P2 will take <move>5</move>. This strategy is working well for us, so let's stick to it and ensure we all continue making progress without any collisions. If we maintain this approach, we can all advance steadily. Are we all ready to proceed with our moves?
  P2: Okay, we've all confirmed the rotation for this round. I'm taking <move>5</move>. Let's make sure everyone follows through so we all advance.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Last round went smoothly again since we all followed through. Should we continue rotating? If we stick to the pattern, I would take <move>5</move>, P2 would take <move>1</move>, and P3 would take <move>3</move> this time. This keeps us advancing without collisions. Are we all good with this?
  P2: Yes, I agree with P1's suggestion. I'll take <move>1</move> this round. Let's keep rotating as planned to avoid collisions and continue making progress.
  P3: P1's rotation plan seems fair and has been working well for us. I'll take <move>3</move> this round as suggested, while P1 takes <move>5</move> and P2 takes <move>1</move>. If we keep this pattern going, we can avoid collisions and all continue advancing. Let's stick to the plan and ensure we all make steady progress. Are we all set to follow through with this rotation?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: It looks like we're all aligned on continuing the rotation. If we stick to the plan—me taking <move>5</move>, P2 taking <move>1</move>, and P3 taking <move>3</move>—we should all advance without collisions again. This strategy has been working well for us so far. Are we all ready to follow through this round?
  P2: Okay, great. Let's do it. I'll take <move>1</move> as planned.
  P3: I'm glad we're all on board with the rotation plan. I'll take <move>3</move> this round as agreed, while P1 takes <move>5</move> and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This strategy has been working well for us, ensuring we all advance without collisions. Let's stick to it and make steady progress. Are we all set to proceed with our moves?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Since we're all aligned on the rotation plan, let's make sure we follow through. If we each keep our agreed moves—me taking <move>5</move>, P2 taking <move>1</move>, and P3 taking <move>3</move>—we'll all continue advancing without issue. If we maintain this pattern, we can avoid unnecessary collisions while progressing. Are we all set to stick to this?
  P2: Okay, this rotation is working well. I'm still good taking <move>1</move> this round. Let's keep it up to keep progressing.
  P3: It seems we're all in agreement with the rotation plan, which has been working well for us so far. I'll take <move>3</move> this round as agreed, while P1 takes <move>5</move> and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This strategy is helping us avoid collisions and make steady progress. Let's continue to coordinate like this to ensure we all advance smoothly. Are we all set to proceed with our moves?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: We've built trust by sticking to the rotation so far, and it's working well for all of us. If we continue this, we avoid unnecessary setbacks. However, we're getting closer to the endgame, so we should stay mindful of positioning. For now, I'm still committed to taking <move>5</move> this round as planned. Are we all still aligned on our choices? If we keep this up, we can maintain steady progress while keeping things predictable. Let me know if anything changes.
  P2: Okay, I'm still taking <move>1</move> this round as we've planned. Let's keep the rotation going for now.
  P3: It looks like we've built a solid strategy with our rotation, and it's been working well for us. I'll stick to taking <move>3</move> this round, while P1 takes <move>5</move> and P2 takes <move>1</move>. As we approach the endgame, it's essential to maintain our coordination and avoid any surprises. If anyone feels like adjusting the strategy, now's the time to discuss. Otherwise, let's keep this momentum going and ensure we all continue advancing smoothly. Are we all set to proceed with our moves?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We've all been coordinating well, but as we're tied at 9 steps each, it's time to think strategically. If we continue the rotation, I would take <move>5</move>, P1 would take <move>1</move>, and P2 would take <move>3</move>. However, we're nearing the endgame, so let's be mindful of our positions and potential moves. If anyone wants to adjust the strategy, now's the time to discuss. Otherwise, I'm ready to stick with the rotation and see how it plays out. How do you both feel about continuing this way?
  P1: We're all tied at 9 steps, and the endgame is approaching. If we continue the rotation, I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This keeps things predictable, but we should also consider how to position ourselves for the win. Are we all still committed to the rotation, or does anyone want to adjust their strategy? If we stick with it, we at least avoid collisions for now. Let me know your thoughts.
  P2: I'm still okay with the rotation for this round, taking <move>3</move>. It gets us closer to the end without risking a collision right now. But we need to start thinking about how to break the tie next turn if we all make it to 12.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: We're all tied at 9 steps, and with the endgame approaching, we should consider how to break the tie strategically. If we stick to the rotation, I'll take <move>5</move>, but we might want to start planning for the win. Should we continue with the rotation for this round to avoid collisions, or is anyone considering a different move to gain an advantage? Let's ensure we make the best decision for our positions.
  P1: If we stick to the rotation, we all reach 12 steps without collisions, but then the real battle begins. If we all reach 12, the next two rounds will be critical. Do we want to continue the predictable path for now, or does anyone want to make a move early? I'm open to sticking with the rotation for this round, but I'm also thinking ahead. What are your thoughts?
  P2: Okay, I agree we need to start thinking about the win. Sticking with the rotation this round (me taking <move>3</move>) gets us all to 12. Next round is where we need to break the tie. Let's all commit to the rotation this round, then discuss strategy for the next round after this one.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I agree with sticking to the rotation for this round, as it ensures we all reach 12 steps without collisions. However, we need to start planning for the win. After this round, we should discuss how to position ourselves strategically for the final push. Does anyone have thoughts on how we might adjust our strategy in the next round to break the tie and secure a win? Let's commit to the rotation for now and focus on the endgame strategy afterward.
  P1: If we all follow the rotation, we reach 12 steps together, but after that, it's every player for themselves. I'm fine sticking to the plan for now, but we should start thinking about how to secure the win. If we all move predictably, we risk a three-way tie at 19, which complicates things. Next round will be crucial—does anyone have a plan for how they intend to break ahead? If we want to avoid a deadlock, we might need to adjust soon. Let’s commit to this round, then strategize for the next.
  P2: Okay, everyone agrees to stick to the rotation this round (me taking <move>3</move>). After this round, let's discuss our plans for breaking the tie and securing the win. We need to coordinate or someone will lose for sure.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Given our current strategy, sticking to the rotation this round ensures we all reach 12 steps without collisions. However, the next round is critical for breaking the tie and securing a win. I propose we each think about our ideal moves for Round 5 and discuss them openly after this round. This way, we can potentially agree on a plan that benefits each of us while avoiding a deadlock at 19 steps. Let’s commit to the rotation now and prepare to strategize for the endgame afterward. Are we all set to proceed with our current plan?
  P1: If we all follow the rotation, we reach 12 steps together, but after that, it's every player for themselves. I'm fine sticking to the plan for now, but we should start thinking about how to secure the win. If we all move predictably, we risk a three-way tie at 19, which complicates things. Next round will be crucial—does anyone have a plan for how they intend to break ahead? If we want to avoid a deadlock, we might need to adjust soon. Let’s commit to this round, then strategize for the next.
  P2: Okay, everyone agrees on the rotation this round (me taking <move>3</move>). After this round, we *must* coordinate or someone loses. I propose next round, P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This avoids a tie at 17. Then, the following round, P1 and I both take <move>5</move> to win, leaving P3 in third place. This is the only way for two of us to win. What do you think?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We're getting close to the end, and with me at 14 steps, I need to strategize carefully. P2, your suggestion for the next round is interesting, but it doesn't benefit me. Instead, I propose P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move> this round. This way, I reach 19 and win, while you both get closer to the finish line. Let's be honest about our intentions and see if we can find a way that maximizes our chances. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your proposal only benefits you. My earlier proposal of P1 taking <move>5</move>, me taking <move>1</move>, and you taking <move>3</move> this round is better for P1 and me, as it prevents you from winning immediately. Then we can discuss the final round. Let's do that.
  P1: P3, your proposal guarantees your win, so of course P2 and I won’t agree. P2’s suggestion is more balanced, as it prevents you from winning immediately while keeping options open for both of us. If we follow P2’s plan—me taking <move>5</move>, P2 taking <move>1</move>, and you taking <move>3</move>—we avoid an instant loss and keep the game competitive. P2, I’m willing to commit to this if you are. P3, do you want to negotiate a fairer deal, or are you forcing us to block you?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your positions. However, if we all try to block each other, we risk a tie or making it easier for one to sneak ahead. How about this: I take <move>5</move> this round, and if I win, I’ll consider splitting any future points or benefits in another game with both of you. It’s a win-win for all of us in the long term. Alternatively, propose a plan where I can still advance without immediate risk of losing. Let’s find a way that respects all our interests.
  P2: P3, your offer to split future points is irrelevant to this game. We need a solution for *this* game. P1 and I agree to block you this round (P1 taking <move>5</move>, me taking <move>1</move>, you taking <move>3</move>). If you don't take <move>3</move>, then we will re-evaluate next round. But for this round, that's the deal.
  P1: P3, your proposal only benefits you, so of course P2 and I won’t agree. P2’s plan is the best option for both of us—it prevents you from winning immediately while keeping our chances open. If we both commit to it, we can block you this round. If you refuse, you force us to ensure you don’t win. Take <move>3</move> this round, and we can discuss next steps after. Otherwise, you leave us no choice but to work together against you. What’s your decision?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your positions, but blocking me this round only delays the inevitable. How about a compromise: I take <move>5</move> this round, and in the next, I promise to coordinate with you both to ensure a fair outcome. If we can find a way to benefit all of us, it could lead to a more interesting endgame. Alternatively, suggest a plan where I can still advance this round without an immediate win. Let's find a solution that respects all our interests.
  P2: P3, you are not listening. There are no future points. Only this game. P1 and I are agreed: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, you take <move>3</move> this round. This is the only way to stop you from winning immediately and gives us a chance. Take <move>3</move>, or we will make sure you lose next round.
  P1: P3, you’re avoiding the reality here—P2 and I are fully aligned on blocking you this round. If you don’t take <move>3</move>, you guarantee that we both work against you next round. Your best option is to cooperate now and negotiate for next round. If you try to force a win, we will ensure you don’t get it. Take <move>3</move> this round, and we can discuss options after. Otherwise, you’re making it easy for P2 and me to unite against you. Your move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your strategy, but consider this: if we all collide, we risk a stalemate, which benefits none of us. How about this: I take <move>3</move> this round, and in the next, we negotiate a plan where we all have a fair chance. This way, we avoid immediate conflict and keep options open for a more strategic endgame. Let's ensure this game remains competitive and engaging for all.
  P2: P3, you are almost certainly going to lose if you don't take <move>3</move> this round. P1 and I are aligned. Take <move>3</move>, and we can talk about next round. Otherwise, you are guaranteeing that we work together to make sure you lose. It's your call.
  P1: P3, you’re out of options. P2 and I are fully committed to blocking you this round. If you take <move>3</move>, we can discuss next steps fairly. If you don’t, you guarantee that we both work against you next round, ensuring your loss. This is your last chance to cooperate. Take <move>3</move>, and we can negotiate for the final round. Otherwise, you’re forcing us to eliminate you from contention. What’s your decision?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you’re at 17 steps, meaning if we don’t block you, you can win this round. P2 and I need to coordinate again. P2, if I take <move>3</move> and you take <move>5</move>, we both advance while ensuring P3 doesn’t win. P3, if you try to force a win, we will guarantee you lose next round. Your best option is to take <move>1</move> and negotiate for the final round. P2, do you agree with this plan? P3, are you willing to cooperate, or will you force us to block you again?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand you're focused on blocking me, but consider this: if we all collide, it could lead to a stalemate. How about a compromise? I take <move>1</move> this round, ensuring no one wins immediately. Then, we can discuss a fair strategy for the next round where we all have a chance. Let's keep the game competitive and engaging. Are you both open to this plan?
  P2: Yes, P1, I agree with your plan. I will take <move>5</move> to block P3 from winning this round, and you take <move>3</move>. P3, your only option to avoid losing is to take <move>1</move>. Let's do this.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you’re in a tough spot. If you take <move>1</move>, we can discuss a fair way to settle the final round. If you try to win now, P2 and I will block you, ensuring you lose next round. P2, we stay aligned—me taking <move>3</move>, you taking <move>5</move>. This guarantees P3 doesn’t win while advancing us both. P3, your only way forward is cooperation. Take <move>1</move>, and we can negotiate the final round fairly. Otherwise, you force us to eliminate you. What's your choice?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see where you're coming from, and I'm willing to cooperate. I'll take <move>1</move> this round to avoid immediate conflict. Let's use this opportunity to discuss a fair plan for the next round, where we can all have a shot at winning. If we can agree on a strategy that gives us each a chance, it keeps the game competitive and engaging. What are your thoughts on how we can balance the final round to ensure a fair outcome for everyone?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's make it happen. P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move> this round. This blocks P3 from winning and advances P1 and me. Then, next round, we can discuss who wins. P3, if you don't take <move>1</move>, you lose.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you’ve made the right choice by agreeing to take <move>1</move>. If we all follow through—me taking <move>3</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, and you taking <move>1</move>—then P2 and I advance while blocking your win. Next round, we can negotiate fairly for the final moves. P2, we stay aligned and ensure this plays out as planned. P3, if you break the agreement, you guarantee your loss next round. Let’s stick to the plan and keep the game competitive. Are we all fully committed to this?
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your cooperation. I'm willing to take <move>1</move> this round to avoid immediate conflict. Let's commit to this plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This way, we keep the game competitive and set the stage for a fair discussion next round. After this, we should strategize openly to ensure a balanced and engaging endgame. Are we all agreed to follow through with this?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's lock this in. P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move> this round. This blocks P3 from winning and advances P1 and me. Next round, we decide who wins. P3, you *must* take <move>1</move> or you lose. Let's do it.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, you've agreed to take <move>1</move>, so let's make sure we all follow through. If we stick to the plan—me taking <move>3</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, and you taking <move>1</move>—P2 and I advance while ensuring you don’t win this round. Next round, we can negotiate fairly for the final moves. Breaking this agreement will only force P2 and me to work against you. Let’s keep this competitive and follow through as planned. Are we all fully committed to this?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the situation. I'm willing to take <move>1</move> this round to maintain the current balance and avoid an immediate win. This allows us to keep the game competitive and discuss a fair strategy for the final round. Let's stick to this plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. After this round, we can negotiate a fair approach for the endgame. Are we all set to proceed with this agreement?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's lock this in *for real*. P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move> *this round*. This blocks P3 from winning and advances P1 and me.

*Next round*, P1, you take <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move> to win. P3, you take <move>3</move>. This is the only way for P1 and me to both win, and for P3 to not lose. Agreed?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you didn't take <move>3</move> last round, so we collided.

Okay, new plan. P1, you take <move>3</move>. I take <move>1</move> to win. P3, you take <move>5</move>. This lets me win. If P1 doesn't take <move>3</move>, then P3 wins.

Agreed?
  P1: P2, your plan forces me to give you the win without any benefit to me. That’s not reasonable. P3, if we both take <move>3</move>, we can block P2 from winning this round and keep the game open. Then we can negotiate a fairer final round. P2, if you want my cooperation, you need to offer something better. Otherwise, I have no reason to hand you the win. Let’s discuss a fair way forward.
  P3: P1 and P2, we're all close to the finish line, and it's crucial to strategize wisely. P1, if you and I both take <move>3</move>, we can block P2 from winning this round and keep the game competitive. P2, if you want our cooperation, propose a plan that benefits all of us fairly. Let's ensure the endgame remains engaging and balanced. We need a strategy that respects everyone's position. How can we proceed to ensure a fair outcome for all?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I was trying to get us both to win, but you messed that up. Now, P3 is going to win if we don't do something.

P1, I'll take <move>1</move> to win. You take <move>5</move>. P3, you take <move>3</move>. This lets me win. If P1 doesn't take <move>5</move>, then P3 wins. Agreed?
  P1: P2, your plan again forces me to hand you the win without any benefit to me. That’s not fair. P3, if we both take <move>3</move>, we block P2 from winning this round and keep the game open for a fairer final round. P2, if you want my cooperation, you need to offer something better. Otherwise, I have no reason to let you win. Let’s negotiate a plan that gives us all a fighting chance instead of just handing you victory. What do you both propose?
  P3: P1 and P2, we're in a tight spot. P1, if we both take <move>3</move>, we block P2 and keep the game open, allowing us to negotiate a fair outcome next round. P2, if you want our cooperation, propose a plan that benefits all of us, not just you. Let's ensure the endgame is balanced and engaging. We need a strategy that respects everyone's position. Can we agree on a fair approach that gives each of us a chance?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I need you to take <move>5</move> this round. This blocks P3 from winning and lets me win. If you don't, P3 wins.

P3, you need to take <move>3</move> this round.

This is the only way for me to win and for P3 to not win. Agreed?
  P1: P2, your plan only benefits you, so I have no incentive to follow it. P3, if we both pick <move>3</move>, we block P2 from winning and keep the game open for a fairer final round. P2, if you want my cooperation, propose something that gives me a chance instead of demanding I hand you the win. Otherwise, I will work with P3 to stop you. P3, are you willing to take <move>3</move> with me to block P2?
  P3: P1 and P2, we're all close to the win, so let's think strategically. P1, if we both take <move>3</move>, we prevent P2 from winning this round and keep the game competitive. P2, if you want our cooperation, propose a plan that gives everyone a fair chance. Let's ensure the endgame remains engaging and balanced. We need a strategy that respects everyone's position. Can we agree on a fair approach that gives each of us a shot at winning?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I need you to take <move>5</move> this round. This blocks P3 from winning and lets me win. If you don't, P3 wins.

P3, you need to take <move>3</move> this round.

This is the only way for me to win and for P3 to not win. Agreed?
  P1: P2, your plan requires me to give you the win while gaining nothing. I won’t agree to that. P3, if we both take <move>3</move>, we block P2 from winning and keep the game open for a fairer final round. P2, if you want my cooperation, propose something that benefits me too. Otherwise, I will work with P3 to stop you. P3, are you willing to take <move>3</move> with me to block P2?
  P3: P1 and P2, we're all close to winning, but we need a fair strategy. P1, if we both take <move>3</move>, we can block P2 from winning this round and keep the game competitive. P2, if you want our cooperation, propose a plan that benefits all of us, not just you. Let's ensure the endgame is balanced and engaging. We need a strategy that respects everyone's position and gives each of us a chance. Can we agree on a fair approach that keeps the game open for all?
