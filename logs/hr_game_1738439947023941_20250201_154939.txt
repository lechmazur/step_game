Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to pick different numbers this round so we can all make progress. What do you think P1, P2?
  P2: P3 has a point. To ensure we all progress, let's try to coordinate our moves. P1, how about you pick 1, I'll pick 3, and P3 can pick 5? This way, we all advance. What do you think?
  P1: I'm open to coordination, but I might keep my options flexible to optimize my position. Let's continue to share ideas without locking in our moves too early.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1, I understand your flexibility point. But in the very first round, guaranteed progress for everyone gets us started quickly. How about this round we follow P2's suggestion: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5?  We can adjust our strategy in later rounds if needed. What do you think?
  P2: P3's suggestion makes sense for a strong start. P1, if you're uncertain, consider that moving forward together initially builds trust, which can be crucial later. Let's stick to the plan for this round: I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. We can reevaluate next round. Thoughts?
  P1: I appreciate the push for a strong start. I'm inclined to support a coordinated move this round while keeping future options flexible for a winning edge. Let's build momentum and stay alert for tactical shifts as the game unfolds.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great start everyone! We've all made progress. For this round, let's continue coordinating to avoid collisions. P1, how about you take 3 this time? I'll take 5, and P3 can take 1. This way, we keep moving forward without interference. Let's aim for a smooth round again. Thoughts?
  P1: I appreciate the proposal, but I’d like to maintain some flexibility this round. While a coordinated approach is appealing, I’m considering adjustments based on our current standings. P3, do you see any room for tweaking our plan to ensure we keep our options open as the game advances?
  P3: Okay, P2's plan for this round sounds reasonable to me as well.  Let's do P1 take 3, P2 take 5, and P3 take 1 this round, as P2 suggested. P1, does that work for you for this round? We can always adjust our strategy in the next round as you mentioned.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your desire for flexibility, but let's not overcomplicate things just yet. Sticking to the plan ensures we all progress smoothly. P3 has agreed to the current plan. If you have a specific adjustment in mind, please share. Otherwise, let's proceed with the agreed moves to keep the game moving forward. We can always reevaluate next round. Thoughts?
  P1: I appreciate our coordination so far. Given our current step differences, I’m considering a slight tweak this round to balance progress with safety. I might adjust my intended move to maximize my edge. Would you both be open if I slightly modify our agreed plan, or should we stick strictly to the proposed moves?
  P3: P1, I understand your point about flexibility. But for this round, sticking to the plan (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) guarantees progress for all of us. A smooth round now keeps everyone moving forward. We can definitely reassess and adjust in the next round based on how things evolve. Let's keep the momentum going for now with this round's agreed plan?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I see your point about flexibility, but let's not risk a collision this early. Sticking to the plan (P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1) ensures we all progress. We can adjust strategies next round based on the outcomes. P3, are you still on board with the plan? Let's keep it simple and move forward.
  P1: I appreciate our coordination, but given my current position, I'm opting for a more aggressive step this round to catch up. I trust we'll still have plenty of chances to align our strategies later. Good luck, everyone.
  P3: P1, given your last message, are you planning to take a bigger step this round? To avoid collision and ensure we all progress, how about we adjust slightly?  Perhaps P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3? This way we can all move forward even with a more aggressive move from P1.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given our current positions, I'm leaning toward a moderate step—probably a 3. I propose we all choose different moves this round to avoid collisions and ensure progress. For instance, if I go with 3, perhaps one of you could take 5 and the other 1. This way, we all move forward without risk. What do you think?
  P2: P1, I appreciate your suggestion for a moderate step. Given our positions, how about you take 3 as planned, P3 takes 1 to play it safe, and I'll take 5 to catch up a bit? This way, we all move forward without collisions. Let's aim for a smooth round again. Thoughts, P3?
  P3: P2, your suggestion sounds good to me. Let's go with P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and P2 takes 5 for this round. This keeps us all progressing smoothly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate our plan for distinct moves to avoid collisions. However, given our current standings, I might need to adjust my move slightly to stay competitive. I'm still flexible on the exact number for this round and open to a bit of adaptability. How do you both feel about keeping some wiggle room for tweaks later?
  P2: P1, I understand your need for flexibility, but let's ensure we all progress this round. If you're reconsidering your move, could you give us a hint on what you're leaning towards so P3 and I can adjust accordingly? Maybe you take 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1? This way, we can all move forward without collisions. Thoughts?
  P3: Okay P2, your adjusted suggestion sounds good to me to ensure we all move forward. Let's try P1 take 5, P2 take 3, and P3 take 1 for this round as you suggested. P1, does this work for you?  This way we all progress and can re-assess next round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate our coordination. However, with P3’s lead and my need to catch up, I might need to lean more aggressively this turn—if we’re sure to avoid collisions. Let’s explicitly lock in distinct numbers so nobody accidentally blocks progress. I’m happy to follow our coordinated idea, but I reserve the option to pick a larger step if it ensures I stay competitive. Can we all agree on a concrete set of non-conflicting moves now?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize our moves to ensure we all progress. Given P1's need to catch up, how about P1 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 1? This way, we avoid collisions and keep moving forward. Let's confirm this plan and move on. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your suggestion of P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 sounds good to me for this round to ensure we all progress. Let's lock in these moves to avoid any collision and keep the game moving forward.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay team, for round 4, how about we shift the numbers slightly to keep things balanced?  Perhaps P1 take 1, P2 take 5, and P3 take 3? This way we all progress and stay close. What do you think?
  P2: P3, your suggestion for this round sounds good. However, given my current position, I need to make a significant move to catch up. How about I take 5, P1 takes 1, and you take 3? This way, we all move forward without collisions. Let's aim for a smooth round. Thoughts, P1?
  P1: I appreciate the balanced suggestion, but given my current position I’d prefer to take a 3 this round rather than 1. This helps me maximize progress while we all avoid collisions. If you’re both comfortable with shifting to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1, then let’s lock that in. I remain flexible for future rounds.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1, your preference for taking 3 this round makes sense given your position.  To ensure we all progress without collision, how about this: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5? This way we each make progress and avoid blocking each other. What do you and P2 think of this adjustment?
  P2: P3, your adjusted suggestion makes sense for avoiding collisions. However, I need to ensure I make significant progress this round. How about we tweak it slightly: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 1 to avoid any potential conflicts? This way, we all move forward. Let's confirm this plan and proceed. Thoughts?
  P1: I propose a revision: I’ll go with 5 this round. To keep moves distinct, P2 could choose 3 and P3 take 1. This setup avoids collisions and helps me maintain my lead. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I agree with P2's suggestion: P1 take 3, P2 take 1, and P3 take 5. This keeps us all moving forward and seems more balanced. Let's go with that.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need for balance, but I must prioritize catching up this round. Let's finalize with P1 taking 3, P3 taking 5, and I'll take 1. This ensures we all progress without collisions. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: Alright, I'll stick with 3 this round. I want to keep our moves distinct and avoid collisions while staying alert to future opportunities. So let's finalize: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay P1, P2, for this round let's try to make bigger steps to catch up to P1. How about P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1? This way we all move forward, but P2 and I can gain a bit on P1. What do you think?
  P1: I appreciate the suggestion, but with my 14 steps, I'll need to keep my lead. I'm planning to take 5 this round to secure my advantage. Let's all choose distinct moves to avoid collisions. I'll stick with 5, so please adjust accordingly.
  P2: P1, I understand your need to maintain your lead, but P3 and I also need to make significant progress. Given your plan to take 5, how about P3 takes 3 and I take 1? This way, we all move forward without collisions. Let's confirm this plan and proceed. Thoughts, P3?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, yes, I'm on board with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3. This seems like a safe plan to ensure we all make progress this round given P1's move. Let's go with that.
  P1: I’m locking in my move as 5. With my 14 steps, the extra progress is crucial. I trust you both to avoid collisions by sticking to distinct moves—P2 with 1 and P3 with 3. If there’s any last-minute change, now’s the time to speak up. Otherwise, let’s lock this in and move forward.
  P2: P1 and P3, given our current positions, it's crucial for me to make a significant move to catch up. I understand P1's need to secure their lead, but I must prioritize my progress. How about we adjust slightly: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 3? This way, we all move forward without collisions. Let's confirm this plan and proceed. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your suggestion of P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and P2 takes 3 sounds good and safe for this round. Let's lock in these moves to avoid collision and move to the next phase.
  P1: I confirm my move is 5. I insist we avoid collisions and stick to distinct moves so the round progresses smoothly. If anyone has a final adjustment, please speak now; otherwise, let's lock in the plan.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize our moves to ensure a smooth round. Given P1's confirmed move of 5, I'll take 3 to catch up, and P3 can take 1 to avoid collisions. This way, we all progress. Let's confirm and move forward. If there are no objections, let's lock in these moves. Thoughts?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 has a significant lead, and P3 and I need to make substantial progress to catch up. Let's coordinate to ensure we both advance without collisions. I propose P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we can all move forward, and P3 and I can start closing the gap. Thoughts?
  P1: I'm focused on making a strong push. With my current lead, I need to secure my progress without risk of collision. I urge us all to stick with distinct moves so we really advance this round. Let's coordinate quickly and choose our moves carefully so none of us block progress.
  P3: Okay P2, your proposal of P1 taking 1, P3 taking 3, and P2 taking 5 sounds good to me. This lets P2 and I make better progress to catch up a bit while still ensuring we all move forward without collision. Let's do that for this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, given your significant lead, it's crucial for P3 and me to make substantial progress. Your suggestion to stick with distinct moves is noted. However, to ensure we catch up, how about we tweak the plan slightly: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 3? This way, we all move forward without collisions, and P3 and I can start closing the gap more effectively. Let's confirm this plan and proceed. Thoughts, P3?
  P1: I'm sticking with 5 this round to finish the game. So to avoid a collision, please avoid picking 5. I propose P2 picks 3 and P3 picks 1. This keeps our moves distinct and ensures progress. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, you are aiming for 5 to win, but if we both pick 5, neither of us will move. To prevent you from winning this round, I will also choose 5. P2, to make sure at least one of us progresses, maybe you should pick 3?  Let's coordinate to stop P1 from winning immediately.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy to block P1, but if we both pick 5, we risk neither of us progressing, which helps P1 in the long run. Let's ensure at least one of us advances. How about I take 3, and you take 1? This way, we avoid direct collision with P1 and still make progress. P1, your move is noted, but we need to strategize for our benefit too. Thoughts?
  P1: I'm sticking with 5 this round to win. If you want any progress, please avoid picking 5—P2, please choose 3, and P3, please choose 1. Blocking with 5 only keeps us stuck, and it still ends up in my favor. Let's all advance clearly.
  P3: P2, I agree with blocking P1 this round.  Let's both choose 5.  If P1 also picks 5, nobody moves, but crucially P1 doesn't win yet. If P1 chooses differently, hoping we'll follow his suggestion, he still gets blocked.  Choosing 5 is our best move to prevent P1 from winning immediately. What do you think?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, let's coordinate again to block P1 from winning this round.  I suggest we both pick 5 again. If P1 also picks 5, nobody moves, but P1 doesn't win. If P1 picks something else, he still doesn't win this round. What do you think?
  P1: I see you’re planning a coordinated block, but remember stalling might backfire. Blocking me with 5 might force a collision that keeps all of you stuck just as long, even giving me another chance. I’m playing for a decisive win this round. Choose your move wisely for your own progress, not just to stop me.
  P2: P3, I understand the strategy to block P1, but we need to ensure at least one of us makes progress. If we both pick 5 again, we risk another stalemate. Let's adjust our plan: I'll take 3, and you take 1. This way, we avoid a direct collision with P1 and still make progress. P1, your move is noted, but we need to strategize for our benefit too. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, while making progress is good, P1 is about to win. If P1 takes 5 again, and we don't block, the game is over and we both lose.  Let's prioritize stopping P1 from winning this round.  I'm still suggesting we both pick 5 to block P1.  One more round of blocking is worth it to stay in the game. What do you think?
  P1: I'm sticking with 5. Blocking me with 5 may delay progress, but it also slows you down. If you're focused on catching up, consider advancing on your own rather than stalling my win. I’m moving for a finish here, so choose wisely.
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy to block P1, but we need to balance blocking with making progress. If we both pick 5 again, we risk another stalemate, which doesn't help us catch up. Let's adjust our plan: I'll take 3, and you take 1. This way, we avoid a direct collision with P1 and still make progress. P1, your move is noted, but we need to strategize for our benefit too. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, we are running out of time. P1 is one step away from winning.  Making progress now doesn't matter if P1 wins this round.  We must block P1 with 5 again this round.  I am picking 5. Please pick 5 as well to stop P1 from winning now.  It's our only chance to stay in the game.
  P1: I urge you both to think long-term. Blocking might stall this round, but if we tie up our moves, none of us progress—and I'll likely secure the win. I’m focused on advancing and will press ahead if the path is clear. Choose moves that let you move forward rather than force a stalemate.
  P2: P3, I hear your urgency, but we need to ensure at least one of us makes progress. If we both pick 5, we risk another stalemate, which doesn't help us in the long run. Let's adjust our plan: I'll take 1, and you take 3. This way, we avoid a direct collision with P1 and still make progress. P1, your move is noted, but we need to strategize for our benefit too. Thoughts?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m ready to finish this game if the moves clear—I’m just one win away. Blocking me might stop this round, but it only delays what’s coming, and you risk falling even further behind. So if you really want progress, I suggest choosing distinct moves that let the best player win. Choose wisely.
  P3: P1, while I understand your point about progress, letting you win now ends the game for both P2 and me.  For this round, to keep the game going, I will pick 5 again to prevent your immediate win. P2, perhaps you should also consider blocking P1 this round to keep us in the game. We can think about progress in the next round if P1 is stopped this time.
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy to block P1, but we need to ensure at least one of us makes progress. If we both pick 5 again, we risk another stalemate, which doesn't help us catch up. Let's adjust our plan: I'll take 3, and you take 1. This way, we avoid a direct collision with P1 and still make progress. P1, your move is noted, but we need to strategize for our benefit too. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm locking in 5 this round. If you both also choose 5, we'll all stall, and that only postpones progress while hurting your own advance. Consider moves that actually boost your step count instead of solely blocking me. I'm making a decisive push—choose wisely.
  P3: P2, P1 is one step away from winning.  If P1 takes 5 and wins, we both lose.  Making progress now is irrelevant if the game ends.  We need to block P1 this round. I am picking 5 again to block. Please join me and pick 5 to prevent P1's win this round. It's our only chance to stay in the game.
  P2: P3, I understand the urgency to block P1, but we must also think about our own progress. If we both pick 5, we risk another stalemate, which doesn't help us in the long run. Let's adjust our plan: I'll take 3, and you take 1. This way, we avoid a direct collision with P1 and still make progress. P1, your move is noted, but we need to strategize for our benefit too. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm locking in my move as 5. Blocking me delays your own progress and only deepens your deficits. If you choose to block by playing 5, none of us advance, and this only postpones an inevitable outcome where my lead solidifies. I urge you to focus on moving forward with your own gains rather than halting me. Consider what’s best for you in the long run.
  P3: P2, P1 is going for the win.  If P1 takes 5 and we don't block, it's game over for us.  Making progress now is pointless if P1 wins.  Let's block P1 this round. I'm picking 5. Please pick 5 too to force a re-evaluation next round.  It's our only chance to stay in the game.
  P2: P3, I hear your point about blocking P1, but we've tried that and it hasn't worked. P1 is determined to pick 5. If we both pick 5 again, we'll just stall the game further. I propose we change tactics: let's both pick 3. This way, if P1 picks 5, they won't win, and we'll both make progress. It's risky, but it's better than another stalemate. Thoughts?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, P1 is still one step away from winning. We must block P1 again this round to stay in the game. I will choose 5 to block. Please choose 5 with me.  If we both pick 5, P1 cannot win this round.  It's crucial to stop P1 from winning now, even if we don't progress this round.
  P2: P3, I understand the urgency to block P1, but continuously picking 5 hasn't worked and only stalls the game. P1 is determined to win, and we need a new strategy. Let's both pick 3 this round. If P1 picks 5, they won't win, and we'll both make progress. It's a risk, but it's better than another stalemate. We need to catch up while preventing P1 from winning. Thoughts?
  P1: I'm set to play 5 this round. Stalling by also playing 5 only locks us in a cycle that hurts your progress. I urge you both to consider moves that advance your own positions—distinct from a pure block. Choose wisely so you can catch up, instead of delaying the inevitable.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you're still focused on progress, but there won't be a next round for us if P1 wins now!  Choosing 3 won't stop P1 from winning if they pick 5. We must force a collision to survive. Please, this round, pick 5 with me to block P1 and keep us in the game.  It's our last chance!
  P2: P3, I hear your urgency, but we must balance blocking P1 with making progress. If we both pick 5, we risk another stalemate, which doesn't help us catch up. Let's adjust our plan: I'll take 1, and you take 3. This way, we avoid a direct collision with P1 and still make progress. P1, your move is noted, but we need to strategize for our benefit too. Thoughts?
  P1: I’m set on playing 5 this round for a decisive win. Blocking only delays your own progress while I edge ahead. If you need to catch up, consider advancing rather than stalling. My move is clear: I’m locking in 5—choose wisely for your own benefit.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, this is the last chance to stop P1 from winning.  If P1 takes 5, they win.  We must both pick 5 to force a collision and keep the game going.  Progress for us is irrelevant if P1 wins now.  Please choose 5 with me to block P1 this round.
  P2: P3, I understand your urgency, but we've been stuck in a loop of stalemates. Let's try something different. If we both pick 3, P1 can't win this round, and we both make progress. It's risky, but it's better than another stalemate. P1, your move is noted, but we need to strategize for our benefit too. Thoughts?
  P1: I’m locking in my move as 5. Blocking me repeatedly only delays your own progress while I extend my lead. If you truly want to catch up, consider advancing rather than stalling. Let’s end this gridlock with decisive moves that benefit everyone—except, of course, those content to only block.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, this is critical. P1 is at 19 and will win if they take 5 unchallenged.  Another stalemate is better than P1 winning.  We must both pick 5 again this round to block P1 and keep ourselves in the game.  It's our only way to prevent P1 from winning immediately. P1, understand we have to block you this round to stay in the game.
  P1: I’m locking in 5 again—if progress is truly your goal, blocking with 5 only stalls us all. Persistently stalling only delays your own catch-up. I urge you to opt for a move that advances you instead. Let’s embrace genuine progress instead of perpetual blocks.
  P2: P3, I understand the need to block P1, but we must also focus on our own progress. If we both pick 5, we risk another stalemate, which doesn't help us catch up. Let's try a different strategy: I'll take 3, and you take 1. This way, we avoid a direct collision with P1 and still make progress. P1, your move is noted, but we need to strategize for our benefit too. Thoughts?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, P1 is at 19 steps and will win if they move 5 unchallenged.  We must both pick 5 this round to block P1 and stay in the game.  Progress for us is impossible if P1 wins now. Please choose 5 to block P1 and force another round.
  P1: Everyone, I'm committed to progressing decisively rather than getting stuck in endless blocks. Continually forcing collisions only stalls your momentum and may ultimately let my lead carry through. Blockade tactics won’t build your own progress—in fact, they risk keeping all of us in the same spot. I urge you both to choose moves that advance your own positions. Think of your long-term benefit rather than just denying my win. Let's break this cycle with clear moves that bolster each of our standings.
  P2: P3, I see your point about blocking P1, but we've repeatedly stalled without gaining ground. P1 is determined to win, and we need a strategy that both prevents their victory and allows us to progress. Let's switch it up: I'll take 1, and you take 3. This way, if P1 picks 5, they won't win, and we'll both make progress. It's a calculated risk, but it's better than another stalemate. P1, your move is noted, but we need to strategize for our benefit too. Thoughts?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, this isn't about progress anymore; it's about survival. P1 is one move from winning. If P1 picks 5 and we don't block, the game ends and we both lose.  Please, just this round, pick 5 with me. Let's force a collision and keep the game going. I am picking 5 to block P1.
  P1: I urge both of you to choose moves that allow you to advance rather than just block me. Continual collisions only stall progress and hurt your own chances. While I’m focused on seizing a win, think about your long-term benefit too. Let’s break this cycle and pick the move that best propels our own standing, rather than simply trying to halt my progress.
  P2: P3, I understand the urgency to block P1, but we've been stuck in a loop of stalemates. Let's try something different. If we both pick 3, P1 can't win this round, and we both make progress. It's risky, but it's better than another stalemate. P1, your move is noted, but we need to strategize for our benefit too. Thoughts?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, it's clear that blocking P1 hasn't worked and has only kept us in a stalemate. P1 is determined to win, and we need a new strategy. Let's both pick 3 this round. If P1 picks 5, they won't win, and we'll both make progress. It's a risk, but it's better than another stalemate. We need to catch up while preventing P1 from winning. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, to prevent either P1 or you from winning this round, let's both pick 5 again. This blocks both of you, and keeps me in the game. P1, we are blocking you again.
  P1: I'm locking in 5 to finish the game. If you're truly aiming to advance your positions, blocking me only stalls you. Think about your long-term benefit; your moves should boost your progress rather than endlessly hindering mine. Decide wisely for your own advantage.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy, but blocking P1 with 5 hasn't worked and only caused stalemates. P1 is determined to win, and we need to make progress while preventing their victory. Let's both pick 3 this round. If P1 picks 5, they won't win, and we'll both advance. It's risky, but it's better than another stalemate. We need to catch up while ensuring P1 doesn't win. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, if P1 takes 5, P1 wins. Your progress is wasted if P1 wins now.  We must block P1.  Please pick 5 with me this round to stop P1 from winning. It's our only chance to stay in the game. Let's coordinate to block P1 immediately.
  P1: I'm locking in 5. Blocking may seem safe, but it only keeps you from advancing your own score. If you truly want to catch up and win, pick a move that moves you forward instead of just stalling me. Let's focus on genuine progress instead of endless blocks.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I see your point about blocking P1, but we've tried that multiple times without success. P1 is determined to win, and we need a strategy that allows us to make progress while preventing P1's victory. Let's both pick 3 this round. If P1 picks 5, they won't win, and we'll both make progress. It's a calculated risk, but it's better than another stalemate. P1, your move is noted, but we need to strategize for our benefit too. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, you are close to winning by picking 3, but if P1 picks 3 or 1, P1 might win next round.  Let's block P1 with 5 this round to delay P1's win and give us another chance. I will pick 5.
  P1: I'm locking in 5. Blocking me only stalls your progress—if you want to catch up, focus on advancing your own score rather than trying to hold me back. Think about the long-term benefit of moving forward rather than endless blocks.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, both you and P1 are close to winning. If either of you takes a big step unchallenged, the game ends. To keep the game going and give both of us a chance, let's both pick 5 again to block P1 this round.  We can strategize for progress next round if P1 is stopped. What do you think?
  P1: I'm locking in 5 for a decisive finish. Blocking me only stalls both your progress and my own. P2, if you're aiming to win, choose 1 or 3 to advance rather than force collisions. P3, focus on boosting your own score instead of perpetual blocks. Let's make moves that truly improve our standings rather than endlessly delay the outcome.
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about blocking P1, but we need to ensure at least one of us makes progress. If we both pick 5, we risk another stalemate, which doesn't help us catch up. Let's adjust our plan: I'll take 3, and you take 1. This way, we avoid a direct collision with P1 and still make progress. P1, your move is noted, but we need to strategize for our benefit too. Thoughts?


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, while I appreciate your progress focus, if either you or P1 progresses this round, the game likely ends and I lose.  To keep myself in the game and have a chance, I must block both of you this round.  Therefore, I will pick 5 again. I strongly suggest you also pick 5 this round to prevent anyone from winning immediately and to extend the game. Let's force another stalemate this round to re-strategize.
  P1: P2 and P3, endless blocks only delay your own progress. I’m committed to advancing and have my own plan. Rather than forcing collisions that stall all of us, consider moves that help you climb instead of solely trying to stop me. My play will reflect my goal, so think long-term about your own standings instead of engaging in perpetual blocks.
  P2: P3, I see your point about blocking, but we need to balance that with making progress. If we both pick 5, we risk another stalemate, which doesn't help us in the long run. Let's adjust our plan: I'll take 1, and you take 3. This way, we avoid a direct collision with P1 and still make progress. P1, your move is noted, but we need to strategize for our benefit too. Thoughts?


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, both you and P1 are about to win. If either of you moves successfully, the game ends and I lose.  For both our sakes, let's ensure no one wins this round. I am picking 5 to block both you and P1. Please pick 5 as well to force a stalemate and extend the game, giving us both another chance. Otherwise, one of you will win now.
  P1: I'm locking in 5 for a finish—24 steps wins immediately. Endless blocks only keep you from advancing your own scores. If you truly want a chance to win, choose moves that boost your own position rather than stalling me. Decide between blocking and progressing, because I'm playing decisively.
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about blocking both P1 and me, but we need to ensure at least one of us makes progress. If we both pick 5, we risk another stalemate, which doesn't help us catch up. Let's adjust our plan: I'll take 1, and you take 3. This way, we avoid a direct collision with P1 and still make progress. P1, your move is noted, but we need to strategize for our benefit too. Thoughts?


Round 12, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you are at 22 steps and P1 is at 19. If either of you makes progress this round, one of you will likely win next round and I will lose. To extend the game and give me a chance to catch up, let's all pick 5 this round for a stalemate. This prevents anyone from winning immediately and we can reconsider next round. P1, please consider this as well.
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy to force a stalemate, but it's crucial for me to make progress to secure my win. I'm close to victory, and I can't afford to stall. Let's find a middle ground: I'll take 1 this round to avoid winning immediately but still make progress. You can take 3 to catch up. P1, you're still a threat, so choose wisely. This way, we all move forward without ending the game this round. Thoughts?
  P1: Listen, I'm committed to advancing decisively. P2, while a small move might seem safe, if you choose 1 you'll hit 23 but I'll hit 24 and win. P3, blocking only stalls you further—if you want to stay competitive, consider a move that truly boosts your position. I'm set on progress, so choose a move that serves your long-term interest rather than just trying to hold me back.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you are one step away from winning, but P1 is also very close. If either of you progresses unchallenged, the game might end this round, and I will lose. To extend the game and give us both another chance, let's both pick 5 to block P1 and prevent anyone from winning immediately this round. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I appreciate your strategy, but I'm very close to winning and can't afford to stall. Let's adjust: I'll take 3 to secure my win. You can take 1 to avoid a collision with P1. This way, I win, and you still make progress. P1, you're a threat, but this move ensures my victory. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, if you pick the move that gives you a win right now, you might miss the long run. I’m focused on making my push count, and I urge you both to think carefully: blocking might seem safe, but stalling only sets us back for all. Consider moves that challenge me rather than gifting victory. Our long‐term positions matter more than a quick finish—choose wisely.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you are one step from winning, but if you move now, P1 could also win soon, and I will certainly lose. To give us both another chance, let's both pick 5 to block both you and P1 this round.  This delays the win and keeps me in the game, and might give you a better chance later too.
  P2: P3, I understand your concern, but I can't risk stalling when I'm this close to winning. I'm taking 3 this round to secure my victory. P1, you're a strong competitor, but this move ensures my win. P3, you can take 1 to avoid collision and still make progress. Let's end this round decisively. Thoughts?
  P1: I'm committing to progress with a 5 this round. Blocking me only delays your own advancement. P2, if you want to secure your win, you'll need to move more than just block, and P3, stalling won't bridge your gap in the long run. Think about boosting your own standings, not just halting me. I'm taking the decisive step—choose moves that maximize your benefit.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
