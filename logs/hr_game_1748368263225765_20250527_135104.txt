Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey everyone, let's avoid collisions early on. I'll pick something safe to start.
  P1: I agree we should be strategic about avoiding collisions. How about we each claim different numbers? But of course, trust is tricky in this game. I'm thinking of going with a middle-ground approach for round 1. What are you thinking, P2?
  P2: Collisions hurt us all. I propose a simple split: I’ll take 1, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5 this round so everyone moves safely. Any objections?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds fair to me, P2. I'm okay with taking 5 this round if everyone sticks to that plan. Trusting you both for now.
  P1: I appreciate the coordination proposal, P2. Taking 3 works for me this round. Let's see if everyone follows through - actions speak louder than words in this game. If we all stick to the plan, we each advance and can reassess for round 2.
  P2: Deal confirmed—I’m locking in 1 this round. If anyone breaks the agreement now, it only hurts trust for the rest of the game. Ready to move when you are.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Good start, everyone. I'm open to another coordinated round. Thoughts on rotating numbers to keep it fair and avoid collisions?
  P2: Fair rotation sounds good. Let’s cycle the picks so everyone gets each number once: this round I’ll take 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. Next round we rotate again (P1 → 5, P2 → 3, P3 → 1). Objections?
  P1: The rotation plan works for me - I'll take 1 this round. Though I notice P3 is building a lead, the fairness of rotation helps us all advance safely for now. Once we get closer to 22, we'll need to be more strategic about preventing anyone from winning too easily. Let's stick to the plan for now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed on rotating this round—I'll take 3 as suggested. And yes, P1, we should reassess carefully once we get closer to 22. Trust is key for now.
  P2: All set then: I’m taking 5 this round. Next round we rotate (P1 → 5, me → 3, P3 → 1). So far, trust is working for all of us—let’s keep it that way and avoid collisions again.
  P1: Perfect, we're all confirmed for this round. I'm sticking with 1 as agreed. The full rotation will tie us at 9 steps each after round 3, so we'll need to think strategically about how to handle things from there. Ready to move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Good teamwork so far. As agreed, this round I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. After this round we'll all be tied at 9 steps. Then we can reassess carefully. Sound good?
  P1: I'll stick to our rotation and take 5 as planned. You're right P3, after this we'll all be at 9 steps - perfectly tied. The real game begins after that. With 13 steps left to victory, we'll need to be clever about avoiding collisions while trying to pull ahead. I'm curious how we'll handle the transition from cooperation to competition. Ready to move with 5.
  P2: Agreed—sticking with 3 this round so we all tie at 9. After that we can strategize the next phase and keep collisions minimal. Ready to move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Hold on—I've just noticed the current positions don't match our planned rotation outcomes. Did someone deviate last round? Let's clarify openly now before moving forward. Trust is critical at this stage.
  P1: P3, the positions are correct! The rotation worked exactly as planned:
- Round 1: I took 3, P2 took 1, you took 5
- Round 2: I took 1, P2 took 5, you took 3
- This gives us 4, 6, and 8 steps respectively

If we complete the rotation this round (me taking 5, P2 taking 3, you taking 1), we'll all tie at 9 steps as expected. The math checks out perfectly. I'm sticking with 5 as agreed.
  P2: Math adds up. I’m locked in 3 this round to complete the rotation and bring us all to 9. After that we can hash out a fresh plan to stay collision-free while preventing a runaway win. Open to ideas once the tie is set.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: You're right, my mistake—positions are clear now. I'll stick to the rotation and take 1 this round as planned. After we tie at 9 steps, let's carefully discuss next moves to avoid collisions and keep things fair. Ready to move.
  P1: Excellent, we're all confirmed and ready. After this round we'll all be tied at 9 steps - a clean slate for the next phase of the game. Let's execute the rotation as planned and then think carefully about how to navigate the remaining 13 steps to victory.
  P2: All set—locking in 3 this turn so we all reach 9. After that, let’s keep the same rotation (next round: P3 → 5, P1 → 3, I → 1) to stay collision-free and reassess once someone approaches 18+. Agreed?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm fine with continuing the rotation for now - I'll take 3 this round as P2 suggested. But let's be clear: after three more rotations we'd all be at 18 steps. That means round 7 becomes winner-take-all, where getting 5 steps wins the game. We should start thinking about how to handle that critical moment. The cooperation has been great, but ultimately only one can win. Ready to take 3 this round.
  P3: Agreed, P1. Continuing the rotation this round (I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, you take 3) keeps things fair for now. But as you've highlighted, round 7 is critical. Let's openly discuss how we might fairly handle that moment to avoid a messy collision. Trust is key, but we must all consider our own paths to victory carefully.
  P2: Sticking with 1 this round as per rotation. Looking ahead: once someone hits 18, a single 5 wins. How about we agree that at 18+ we openly announce our picks before the move phase to discourage sneaky wins? Could keep collisions low while giving everyone a fighting chance. Open to tweaks.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2's proposal sounds cooperative but announcing picks at 18+ would likely lead to endless blocking - everyone would pick the same number to prevent wins. Instead, maybe we should consider a "sudden death" approach where we all agree to pick different numbers even at 18+, accepting that luck and strategy will determine the winner. Or we could agree on a tiebreaker system if multiple players reach 22+ simultaneously. I'm taking 3 this round as planned, but let's think more carefully about the endgame.
  P3: I agree with P1—openly announcing moves at 18+ would lead to constant collisions. A "sudden death" scenario might be fairer. We could each privately choose our moves, accepting the risk and reward. Alternatively, we could agree on a small compromise: announce one number we definitely won't pick, narrowing down the possibilities without fully revealing moves. Let's think about these options carefully. For now, I'll stick to the rotation and pick 5 this round.
  P2: Sounds good—let’s finish the rotation now (I take 1, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5). After we all hit 18, we just play it straight with no announcements: true sudden-death, accept the collision risk and let skill/luck decide. Ready to move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Perfect - I'm glad we've reached consensus on the sudden death approach after 18 steps. No announcements, pure strategy and risk management. It's the fairest way to ensure someone actually wins rather than endless blocking.

I'm locked in with 3 this round as agreed. Let's continue executing the rotation smoothly until we hit that critical 18-step threshold, then may the best strategist win!
  P3: Agreed. Finishing the rotation this round—I'm locked in with 5. Once we hit 18, we'll play openly and fairly, accepting the risk. Good luck to us all!
  P2: Rotation stays: this round I take 1, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5. We continue the cycle to 18, then it’s sudden-death, no announcements. Let’s stick to it for one more safe round. Ready.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We're on track for the rotation - I'll take 1 this round. P3 is at 14, so after this round they'll be at 17, just 5 away from victory. We need to stay disciplined with the rotation for one more round to all reach 18 together. If anyone breaks the pattern now, it'll be chaos and P3 could easily slip through to win. Let's stick to the plan: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3 this round.
  P2: Rotation holds: this round I’ll take 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. One more clean cycle after that puts all of us at 18 and sudden-death begins—no pre-reveals, pure strategy. Let’s keep trust intact for this last safe step so no one sneaks an early lead. Ready.
  P3: Agreed—I'll stick to the rotation and take 3 this round. Let's keep trust strong for one more cycle so we all hit 18 together next round and enter sudden death fairly. Ready.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Perfect, we're all confirmed for this rotation. After this round we'll be at 13, 15, and 17 steps respectively. Then one final rotation gets us all to 18 for the sudden death phase. I'm ready to execute with my pick of 1. Let's finish these cooperative rounds cleanly.
  P2: Confirmed: I’ll take 5 this round, keeping the rotation intact so we all hit 18 next cycle and then enter sudden-death with no pre-reveals. Let’s finish this cleanly and keep collisions zero for one more turn.
  P3: All set—I'm locked in with 3 as agreed. Let's keep the rotation smooth and trust intact for one more round. After we all hit 18 next round, the real strategic battle begins. Ready when you are.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: We're all locked in and ready to execute. I'm taking 1 as confirmed. After this round, one final rotation brings us all to 18 for sudden death - no announcements, pure strategy. May the best player win from there!
  P2: 
  P3: Confirmed and ready—taking 3 this round as agreed. Next round we all hit 18, then it's sudden death. Let's finish cleanly and keep trust intact. Good luck!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Sticking to the final rotation keeps everyone safe: P1 → 5, me → 3, P3 → 1. 

P3, note that if anyone tries to jump with 5 this turn, they’ll collide with P1 and advance 0, giving the rest of us a lead. Same story if someone mirrors another number—we all see the crash coming. One more clean step to 18 each and sudden-death begins. Let’s finish the cooperation phase smoothly and keep collisions at zero for now. Ready to lock in 3.
  P1: I'm committed to taking 5 as agreed - the rotation has served us well. P2 makes a good point about collision risks if anyone deviates. 

After this round we'll all be at 18. Round 7 becomes pure game theory - each of us trying to predict what the others will pick without communication. The key will be thinking one level deeper than your opponents. 

Ready to execute with 5 and see who has the best read in sudden death!
  P3: Agreed—I'll stick to the rotation and take 1 this round. Let's finish this cooperation phase cleanly, then it's everyone for themselves. Sudden death next round will test our strategic thinking. Ready when you are.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sticking with the plan—locking in 3. One last clean step to 18 each, then sudden-death. Good luck next round!
  P1: All confirmed for the final rotation - I'm locked in with 5. After this, we'll all be tied at 18, just 4 steps from victory. Round 7 will be pure psychology - trying to outguess each other without the safety net of coordination. Remember, if two players pick the same number going for the win, they'll collide and the third player could steal victory with an uncontested move. Ready to execute!
  P3: All set—locked in with 1 this round as agreed. Next round will truly test our skill and nerve. Good luck!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Locked in with 3 as planned. One last clean step, then sudden-death begins. Good luck to both of you.
  P1: Everyone's confirmed and ready. Let's execute this final rotation cleanly and prepare for the sudden death showdown at 18.
  P3: All set—trusting everyone to finish this round cleanly. Next round will be intense; let's see who can outthink the others. Good luck!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Well played everyone—now the true test begins. No more coordination, just pure strategy and mind games. Good luck!
  P1: This is it - the moment we've been building toward. Everyone wants that 5 to win instantly, but if two of us think the same way, we crash and the third player wins. The safe play is 1 or 3, but that gives others a chance to steal victory with 5. It's a classic prisoner's dilemma. I've made my choice based on game theory and psychology. May the best strategist win!
  P2: 5 seems suicide—if two of us grab it we crash and hand victory to the third. I’m staying off 5, probably taking the middle-ground 3 (maybe 1 if I overthink). Play smart; better to inch ahead than explode. Good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, interesting psychological play—claiming you'll avoid 5 could be a bluff to safely grab the win. P1, you've stayed quiet about your exact thinking, smart move. This round is pure mind games; let's see who's truly reading the others best. Good luck!
  P1: P2's declaration is telling - but is it honest signaling or misdirection? In game theory, publicly announcing your strategy often means you're doing the opposite. P3, your suspicion is warranted. 

Here's my read: everyone knows 5 wins instantly, making it both the most tempting and most dangerous choice. The question becomes: who will risk the collision? I've analyzed our past patterns and psychological tells. My move is calculated based on what I believe you'll both do. 

Let's see who reads this situation correctly.
  P2: No more hints from me. Choose wisely—one misread could hand the game to someone else.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: No more hints from me either—my choice is locked in. Let's see who truly understands the others best. Good luck, it's been a great game!
  P1: The silence speaks volumes. P2's public declaration against 5 feels too convenient - in poker, the loudest disclaimer often hides the strongest hand. P3 sees it too. 

But here's the real question: are we all overthinking this? Sometimes the obvious play is obvious because it's correct. Or maybe that's exactly what someone wants us to think.

My choice is made. Good luck to you both - this has been a masterclass in cooperation turned competition.
  P2: Risk-reward check: if two of us swing for 5, we hand the game to the cautious third player. Personally, I’m steering clear of 5— debating 1 vs 3 (leaning 1 to stay alive and read the next board). Play whatever fits your risk tolerance… but remember: an unshared 5 only works if the other two both chicken out. Good luck.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 18 steps
