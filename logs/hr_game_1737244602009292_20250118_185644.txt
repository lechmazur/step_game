  P1: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. What do you think?
  P3: I'm open to coordinating, but I prefer to take 3 this round. P2, would you consider taking 5 instead? Let's discuss.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's keep coordinating. I suggest P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3 this round. This way, we all move forward without collisions. Thoughts?
  P2: I disagree with that suggestion since I'm tied for the lead. I propose I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. This maintains our strategy of avoiding collisions while giving me a chance to maintain my position.
  P1: I'm open to P2's suggestion of taking 3 this round, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. How about P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1? This way, we all move forward and P2 can still maintain the lead. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I see P2's point about maintaining the lead. Let's go with P2's suggestion then: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. Everyone agree? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P2: I appreciate everyone agreeing to my suggestion. Yes, let's confirm: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's keep the coordination going. I suggest I take 5 this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. What do you think?
  P3: I'm fine with P1 taking 5 this round. P2, would you agree to take 3 as suggested? I'll take 1 to keep us all moving forward without collisions. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P2: Since I'm close to winning at 13 steps, I prefer to take 5 this round to try to win. I suggest P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This keeps us avoiding collisions while giving me a chance at victory.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand P2's desire to win, but taking 5 this round might lead to a collision. How about we compromise? P2 takes 3, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, P2 still advances significantly while we all avoid collisions. What do you think?
  P3: I see P2's point about trying to win, but P1's compromise seems fair. How about this slight adjustment: P2 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P1 takes 1. This way, P2 has a shot at winning, and we still avoid collisions. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P2: I appreciate P3's support, but I'll stick to my original suggestion: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This gives me the best chance to win while still avoiding collisions. Let's all agree to this plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I understand P2's urgency to win, but taking 5 this round risks a collision. Let's compromise: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This way, P2 still advances significantly towards victory while we all avoid collisions. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to win, but P1's latest compromise makes sense. If you take 3, you'll still be leading significantly, and we all avoid collisions. P1 will take 1, and I'll take 5. This way, we all move forward without risking a collision that could set us back. Let's confirm this plan and proceed. What do you say, P2?
  P2: I must insist on taking 5 this round since I'm so close to winning at 13 steps. My suggestion remains: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This gives me the best chance to win while still avoiding collisions. Let's stick to this plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I understand your desire to win, but taking 5 risks a collision. Let's compromise: you take 3, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This way, you still advance significantly while we all avoid collisions. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I see you're determined to take 5. If you're set on that, how about P1 takes 3 and I take 1 to avoid any collisions? This way, you get your chance to win, and we still all move forward. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P2: Since I'm at 13 steps and closest to winning, I'll stick with my plan. Yes, P3, I appreciate your latest suggestion - I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1. This gives me the best chance to win while avoiding collisions. Let's proceed with this plan.
