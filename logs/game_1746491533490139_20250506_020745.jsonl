If I take 1 or 3, you win. If I take 5, I collide with you, and P2 wins. In all these scenarios, I lose.\n\nTo have any chance of winning or sharing the win, I must take 5 this turn. This puts me at 23 steps.\n\nIf P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 5, P1 and P3 collide, P2 advances and wins.\n\nWe need a different set of moves to avoid P2 winning alone. I will take 5. What will you two do?"}
