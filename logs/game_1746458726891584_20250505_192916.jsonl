However, if in the move phase, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, there's no collision because all numbers are different. Wait, but the numbers are 5,1,3\u2014so all different. So all advance. Then next round, P3 would be at 23, needing 1 step. But P1 would be at 21, and P2 at 19.\n\nBut P1's goal is to win. So maybe P1 should take 5 here to get to 21, which is still two steps behind P3's 23. But in the next round, P3 could take 1 to win. So P1 needs to block P3 somehow. Wait, but in the next round, if P3 is at 23, they can take 1 to reach 24. Unless someone collides with them. So P1 might need to take 1 in the next round to collide with P3 if they take 1. But in this round, if P1 takes 5, they don't interfere with P3's next move. Alternatively, if P1 takes 3, then P3 might take 3 again and collide. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the current Round 7, the conversation is in Sub-round 3. The user (P1) needs to send a message. The previous messages from P1 were about taking 5, but P3 switched to 3, so P1 might need to confirm their move. But since the move phase hasn't happened yet, P1 can still choose any move. However, in the conversation, P3 mentioned switching to 3, and P2 taking 1. So if P1 sticks with 5, then all move without collision. But then P3 is at 23, and next round can win. So maybe P1 should try to take 3 instead, to collide with P3's 3, but that would prevent both from advancing. But P1 is at 16, so taking 3 would reach 19. If P3 takes 3, they reach 23. If they collide, both stay at 16 and 20. Wait, no: collision rules say if multiple players pick the same number, none of those players advance. So if P1 and P3 both take 3, then neither P1 nor P3 advances. So P1 would stay at 16, P3 at 20. Then P2 taking 1 would advance to 19. That might delay P3's victory.\n\nBut P1's goal is to win. If P3 can win next round by taking 1, then P1 should try to block that. So if P1 takes 1 in Round 7, then in the move phase, P1 would reach 17. P2 taking 1 would collide, but if P2 is taking 1 as per the plan, then both P1 and P2 taking 1 would mean they collide and don't advance. But P3 taking 3 would reach 23. Then in Round 8, P3 can take 1 to win. Alternatively, if P1 takes 3 in Round 7, reaching 19. Then in Round 8, P3 is at 20+3=23, same as before. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nThe key is that in Round 7, if P3 takes 3, they go to 23. If P1 takes 5, they go to 21. Then in Round 8, P3 can take 1 to win. So P1 needs to prevent that. Therefore, in Round 7, P1 should take 3 to collide with P3's 3, preventing P3 from advancing. That way, P3 stays at 20, and P1 stays at 16. Then P2 taking 1 would go to 19. Then in Round 8, P1 can take 5 to reach 21, P2 takes 5 to reach 24 (if possible), but wait, P2 is at 19, adding 5 would be 24. Wait, 19 +5=24? 19+5=24? 19+5 is 24? No, 19+5=24? 19+5=24? 19+5=24? No, 19+5 is 24? Wait 19+5=24? 19+5=24? Let me check: 19 +5 is 24? 19+5=24. No, 19+5=24? Wait 19+5=24? 19+5=24? 19+5=24? 19+5=24? 19+5=24? No, 19+5=24? No, 19+5=24? 19+5=24? 19+5=24?
