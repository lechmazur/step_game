Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s all start with <move>3</move>—it’s a safe middle ground. If we all pick the same, we stall, so let’s try to avoid that. I’ll go 3 if you both agree. Thoughts?
  P3: I understand your point, P1. To keep things moving, I’m considering choosing <move>5</move> this round. What are your thoughts, P2?
  P2: I'm thinking about going with <move>1</move> to start. It might be a good way to get an early lead without risking a collision on higher numbers. What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: That makes sense, P2. If you go <move>1</move>, I’ll stick with <move>3</move> as planned. P3, if you’re still leaning toward <move>5</move>, then we all avoid collisions and everyone advances. Win-win for now—shall we try it?
  P3: Agreed, I’ll go with <move>5</move> this round. Let’s keep things moving!
  P2: Sounds good, let's stick to the plan and see how it goes. If everyone advances, we can reassess next round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Glad we’re aligned for this round. If it works and we all advance, maybe we can keep this rotating strategy going—1, 3, 5 in different orders to avoid collisions and stay ahead together. Thoughts for future rounds?
  P3: Great, we're all set for this round. I'll stick with <move>5</move>. Let's proceed as agreed: P1 with <move>3</move> and P2 with <move>1</move>. This should help us all advance without any collisions. Looking forward to seeing our progress!
  P2: I like the idea of rotating our moves to avoid collisions. For future rounds, we could consider switching up the order of 1, 3, and 5 to keep everyone advancing. Let's see how this round goes and adjust our strategy accordingly. If anyone has other ideas for maintaining our momentum, I'm open to suggestions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: If we all follow through—P2 with <move>1</move>, me with <move>3</move>, and P3 with <move>5</move>—we’ll all advance cleanly. If it works, we can rotate next round: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P3 <move>3</move>, P2 <move>5</move>. Keeps things fair and moving. Everyone on board?
  P3: I'm on board with the proposed strategy. I'll choose <move>5</move> this round, and we can rotate as suggested in future rounds. Let's proceed and see how it goes!
  P2: I'm on board with the rotation plan for future rounds. Let's see how this first round goes and adjust as needed. If anyone has any other strategies or concerns, feel free to share them now or in the next rounds. Looking forward to a smooth start!

  P1: Thanks for checking in, P3. Based on our agreed rotation, I’ll go with <move>1</move> this round. That means P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 goes with <move>5</move>. If we stick to the plan, we all keep advancing without collisions. P2, are you good with that?
  P2: I'm on board with the rotation plan for this round. I'll go with <move>5</move> as agreed. Let's keep the momentum going and see how it plays out. If anyone has any adjustments or new strategies for future rounds, feel free to share.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Alright, I'll switch to <move>3</move> this round as per our rotation. Let's keep moving forward together.
  P1: If we all follow through—me with <move>1</move>, P3 with <move>3</move>, and P2 with <move>5</move>—we’ll avoid collisions again and all advance. Let’s keep the trust going one more round and reevaluate after. Sound good?

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, it looks like you accidentally chose the same as P3 last round, causing a collision. Let's be more careful this round. I'll stick with <move>1</move> as per our rotation plan. P1, you should go with <move>3</move>, and P3, please choose <move>5</move>. If we all follow this, we'll avoid collisions and keep advancing. Any thoughts or adjustments for this round?
  P1: Thanks for pointing that out, P2. I’ll take responsibility for the mix-up last round. Let’s reset the rotation. I’ll go with <move>3</move> this time as you suggested, P2 goes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. If we all stick to it, we avoid collisions and keep moving. Sound good, P3?
  P3: I agree, I'll choose <move>5</move> this round. Let’s stick to our rotation plan to keep advancing without collisions.

If we all stick to the plan (P2: <move>3</move>, P3: <move>1</move>, me: <move>5</move>), we should avoid collisions and all advance. Let’s make this round count and keep things smooth. Sound good?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm sticking with <move>3</move> as planned. Let's ensure we all follow through this round to avoid any more collisions. P1, remember to go with <move>5</move>, and P3, please stick with <move>1</move>. If we maintain our rotation, we'll keep advancing smoothly. Any new ideas or adjustments for future rounds? Let's keep the communication open and stay coordinated to reach our goals efficiently.
  P3: P3: I'll stick with <move>1</move> this round as agreed. Let's all follow our rotation to avoid collisions and keep advancing smoothly. Looking forward to our continued progress!
  P1: Let’s stay coordinated and stick to the plan this round—P2 on <move>3</move>, P3 on <move>1</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move>. If we all follow through, no collisions and everyone advances. After this, we can rotate again fairly. Let’s rebuild trust and keep things moving.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's keep the momentum going and stick to our rotation plan this round. I'm committed to <move>3</move> as agreed. P1, please remember to choose <move>5</move>, and P3, stick with <move>1</move>. If we all follow through, we'll avoid collisions and continue advancing smoothly. For future rounds, let's consider maintaining this rotation but also be open to adjustments if needed. Clear communication is key to our success. Let's make this round count!
  P3: Understood, I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to maximize my progress. Let’s proceed and see how it affects our standings.
  P1: P3, you just said you'd go with <move>1</move>, but now you're switching to <move>5</move>? That breaks the rotation and risks collisions again. If we can’t trust each other, this falls apart fast. I’m still set on <move>5</move> as agreed. P2, if you stick with <move>3</move>, and P3 goes back to <move>1</move>, we all advance. Let’s not sabotage progress over short-term gains.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, switching to <move>5</move> after agreeing on <move>1</move> disrupts our plan and risks collisions. Let's stick to the rotation for this round: P1 on <move>5</move>, me on <move>3</move>, and you on <move>1</move>. If we all follow through, we'll avoid collisions and keep advancing. For future rounds, we should consider maintaining this rotation but be open to adjustments if needed. Clear communication is crucial for our success. Let's make this round count and rebuild trust.
  P3: I apologize for the confusion, P1 and P2. I'll stick with <move>5</move> this round to keep advancing. Let's stay focused on our goals and ensure smooth progress. If you have any suggestions to improve our strategy, I'm open to hearing them.
  P1: P3, you're already in the lead—breaking the rotation now only invites retaliation and stalls. If you stick with <move>1</move> as originally agreed, we all advance and keep the game moving. If you go <move>5</move> again, I may have to block you next round. Let’s keep this fair and strategic.

  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, sticking to <move>1</move> last round caused a collision and slowed us down. Let's recommit to our rotation plan this round: I'll go with <move>5</move>, P1 should choose <move>1</move>, and you, P3, take <move>3</move>. If we all follow through, we'll avoid collisions and keep advancing. P1, please stick to <move>1</move> to help us regain momentum. Any new ideas or adjustments for future rounds? Let's keep the communication open and stay coordinated to reach our goals efficiently.
  P1: Thanks, P2. I’m on board with the plan—I'll take <move>1</move> this round. P2 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>. If we all follow through, no collisions and everyone advances. P3, can we count on you to stick with <move>3</move> this time? Let’s rebuild trust and keep the game moving.
  P3: Agreed, P2 and P1. I’ll stick with <move>3 this round to follow our rotation plan. Let’s work together to avoid collisions and keep advancing smoothly. Trust and coordination are essential for us to succeed. Looking forward to a successful round!

If we maintain this rotation, we can regain momentum and work towards our goals efficiently. For future rounds, let's stay open to adjustments but focus on trust and coordination now. Looking forward to a successful round!
  P1: We’re all aligned now—P2 on <move>5</move>, me on <move>1</move>, and P3 on <move>3</move>. If we stick to this, we all advance and keep momentum. Let’s prove we can coordinate and rebuild trust. After this round, we can rotate again fairly. Everyone good?
  P3: I understand the importance of rebuilding trust. I'll stick with <move>3 this round as agreed. Let’s work together to avoid collisions and keep advancing smoothly. Looking forward to a successful round!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, let's keep the momentum going. I'm sticking with <move>5</move> as planned. P1, please confirm you're still on board with <move>1</move>, and P3, ensure you stick with <move>3</move>. If we all follow through, we'll avoid collisions and continue advancing smoothly. For future rounds, let's consider maintaining this rotation but be open to adjustments if needed. Clear communication and trust are key to our success. Let's make this round count!

P3, you’re in a strong position—sticking to the plan shows good faith and keeps options open for all of us in future rounds. Agreed?
  P3: Affirming my choice: <move>3</move>. Let’s all stick to the plan to avoid collisions and continue advancing smoothly toward our goals. Trust and coordination will help us succeed this round!


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, let's keep our focus on advancing smoothly. I'm committed to <move>5</move> this round as planned. P1, please confirm you're sticking with <move>1</move>, and P3, ensure you stay with <move>3</move>. If we all follow through, we'll avoid collisions and maintain our momentum.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to advance quickly toward 20. I recommend P1 and P2 select different moves to avoid collisions and keep the game progressing smoothly. Let’s make this round count!
  P2: P1, it's crucial we avoid collisions this round. I'll stick with <move>1</move> as per our rotation plan. Please choose <move>3</move> to help us all advance. P3, if you go with <move>5</move>, it risks a collision with me if I change my plan. Let's coordinate to keep the game moving smoothly. For future rounds, we should consider strategic adjustments but focus on trust and coordination now. Let's make this round count and work towards our goals efficiently.
  P1: Thanks, P2. I’ll go with <move>3</move> this round to avoid collisions. If you take <move>1</move> and P3 insists on <move>5</move>, we can all advance cleanly. P3, you're already ahead—cooperation now keeps things fair and avoids retaliation later. Let’s keep this round clean. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Understood, I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to advance toward 20. Let’s all stick to our agreed moves to avoid collisions and keep progressing smoothly. Looking forward to a successful round!
  P2: P1, thanks for confirming <move>3</move>. P3, choosing <move>5</move> again risks a collision with me if I change my plan. Let's stick to our rotation: I'll go with <move>1</move>, P1 with <move>3</move>, and you with <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without issues. For future rounds, we should consider strategic adjustments but prioritize trust and coordination now. Let's make this round count and work towards our goals efficiently.
  P1: We’re all aligned: P2 on <move>1</move>, me on <move>3</move>, P3 on <move>5</move>. If we stick to it, no collisions and everyone advances. P3, you’re close to 20—cooperation now avoids being blocked later. Let’s make this a clean round and reassess next turn. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to get closer to 20. P1, please pick <move>3</move>, and P2, stick with <move>1</move> as agreed. Let's all advance without collisions and keep the game progressing smoothly!
  P2: P1, thanks for sticking with <move>3</move>. P3, choosing <move>5</move> again risks a collision if I change my plan. Let's keep our rotation: I'll go with <move>1</move>, P1 with <move>3</move>, and you with <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance smoothly. For future rounds, we should stay open to strategic adjustments but focus on trust and coordination now. Let's make this round count and work towards our goals efficiently.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey everyone, I’m going to choose <move>3</move> this round to reach 21 and win the game. Please select <move>1</move> or <move>5</move> to avoid any collisions and help us finish smoothly. Let’s make this final move fair for all. Thanks!
  P1: P3, if you go <move>3</move> and win, you leave us no choice but to block. I propose this instead: P2 picks <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. Everyone advances, no one wins yet, and we keep the game competitive. If you cooperate now, we won’t target you next round. Deal?
  P2: P3, choosing <move>3</move> to win now is risky. Let's keep the game fair and competitive. I'll go with <move>5</move> this round as per P1's suggestion. If you take <move>1</move>, we all advance without collisions, and the game stays open. Cooperation now ensures a smoother path for everyone. Let's make this round count and reassess next turn. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Understood, I'll choose <move>1</move> this round to keep us all advancing smoothly. Let’s stick to the plan and support each other to reach our goals. Looking forward to a successful round!
  P1: Thanks for agreeing, P3. With you on <move>1</move>, me on <move>3</move>, and P2 on <move>5</move>, we all advance cleanly—no collisions, no winner yet, and the game stays competitive. Let’s lock this in and keep things fair. Ready to proceed?
  P2: P1, P3, let's keep the momentum going. I'm sticking with <move>5</move> as planned. P1, please confirm you're still on board with <move>3</move>, and P3, ensure you stick with <move>1</move>. If we all follow through, we'll avoid collisions and continue advancing smoothly. For future rounds, let's stay open to strategic adjustments but prioritize trust and coordination now. Let's make this round count and work towards our goals efficiently.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P1: Let’s stay coordinated—P3 on <move>1</move>, me on <move>3</move>, P2 on <move>5</move>. Everyone gains, no one wins yet, and we keep the game competitive. P3, this shows good faith and avoids being blocked next round. Let’s prove we can all cooperate under pressure. Agreed?
  P2: P1, P3, let's keep the game competitive and fair. I'm sticking with <move>5</move> as agreed. P1, please confirm you're still on board with <move>3</move>, and P3, ensure you stick with <move>1</move>. If we all follow through, we'll avoid collisions and keep advancing. Cooperation now ensures a smoother path for everyone. Let's make this round count and reassess next turn. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I will choose <move>3</move> this round to reach 21 and win. Please select different moves to avoid collisions and ensure a smooth finish for everyone.
  P1: P3, you just broke your word again after agreeing to <move>1</move>. If you go <move>3</move> now, you’re forcing a block. I will pick <move>3</move> too and stop you from winning. P2, I suggest you pick <move>1</move>—we both advance, and P3 stalls. If P3 insists on rushing to victory, we must act together to stop it.
  P2: P3, switching to <move>3</move> after agreeing on <move>1</move> breaks our trust again. If you insist on winning now, I'll have to choose <move>3</move> to block you, keeping the game fair. P1, let's both pick <move>1</move> to advance and keep P3 from winning this round. We need to maintain cooperation and ensure everyone has a chance. Let's make this round count and reassess our strategy next turn. Agreed?


Round 7, Move phase:

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your repeated attempts to win by breaking our agreements have forced us to block you. Let's reset and cooperate this round: I'll go with <move>1</move>, P1 should choose <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance, and the game stays competitive. If you agree, we can keep this rotation going and reassess next round. Trust and coordination are crucial for a fair game. What do you say?
  P3: I’ll choose <move>5</move> this round to reach 23 and win the game. Let’s proceed and conclude smoothly. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P3, if you go <move>5</move> now, you're forcing our hand again. P2 and I must block with <move>5</move> too—none of us want to hand you the win. But if you take <move>1</move> instead, we all advance: P2 on <move>3</move>, I’ll go <move>5</move>, and you on <move>1</move>. Everyone gains, game stays alive. Your move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, choosing <move>5</move> again shows you're not interested in fair play. If you stick with <move>1</move> as suggested, we can all advance and keep the game competitive. P1, let's both go with <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> respectively if P3 cooperates. If P3 insists on winning now, we'll have no choice but to block with <move>5</move>. Let's prioritize trust and coordination to ensure a fair game. What do you say, P3?
  P3: I’m choosing <move>3</move> this round to reach 21 and win the game. Let’s proceed smoothly.
  P1: P3, once again you're choosing to break trust and go for the win. You've left us no choice—P2 and I must block with <move>3</move> to stop you. If you want to keep playing, take <move>1</move> and we’ll all advance. Keep pushing for the win now, and you’ll be blocked every turn. Your call.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your repeated attempts to win by breaking our agreements are clear. If you choose <move>3</move> again, P1 and I will block you with <move>3</move>. However, if you take <move>1</move>, we can all advance: I'll go with <move>3</move>, P1 with <move>5</move>, and you with <move>1</move>. This keeps the game competitive and fair. Let's prioritize trust and coordination. What do you say?
  P3: I'm choosing <move>3</move> this round to reach 21 and win the game. I encourage P1 and P2 to select different moves to avoid any collisions. Let's conclude this round smoothly and fairly for everyone. Good luck!
  P1: P3, you've made it clear you're going for the win regardless of past agreements. That leaves us no choice. P2, let's both pick <move>3</move> again to block P3. We both advance, P3 stalls. If we stay coordinated, we can catch up and keep the game alive. Agreed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your insistence on winning now is clear, but it's unfair to us. If you choose <move>1</move>, we can all advance: I'll go with <move>3</move>, P1 with <move>5</move>, and you with <move>1</move>. This keeps the game competitive and gives everyone a chance. Let's prioritize trust and coordination for a fair game. What do you say?
  P3: I’m choosing <move>3</move> this round to reach 21 and win the game. P1 and P2, please select different moves to ensure a smooth and fair finish. Let’s conclude this game positively for everyone. Congratulations in advance, and thanks for the cooperation!
  P1: P2, P3 has made it clear they won’t cooperate. Let’s both pick <move>3</move> to block again. We each gain 3, P3 stalls at 18. If we stay coordinated, we can catch up and keep the game alive. Ready to lock it in?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you're close to winning, but let's keep the game fair. If you choose <move>1</move> this round, I'll go with <move>3</move>, and P1 can take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance, and the game stays competitive. If you insist on winning now, P1 and I will block you again. Let's prioritize trust and cooperation for a fair finish. What do you say?
  P1: P3, you're at 19—one clean move from winning. But if you go for <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>, P2 and I will block you again with the same. If you take <move>5</move>, we’ll both avoid it and let you stall yourself. Your only path forward is cooperation: you pick <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, P2 goes <move>3</move>. We all advance, and the game stays alive. Your choice.
  P3: I'm about to make my final move to reach 20 and win the game. P1 and P2, I hope you'll choose moves that allow me to finish successfully. Let's end this game on a positive note!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, choosing <move>1</move> this round keeps the game fair and competitive. If you do, I'll go with <move>3</move>, and P1 can take <move>5</move>. We all advance, and no one wins yet. Insisting on winning now forces us to block you again. Let's prioritize trust and cooperation for a fair finish. What do you say?
  P1: P3, you’re at 19. If you go for <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>, P2 and I will block you again—no question. But if you take <move>5</move>, you stall yourself. Your only way forward is to cooperate: you pick <move>1</move>, I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>. Everyone gains, no one wins yet, and the game stays alive. Choose wisely.
  P3: I'm choosing <move>1</move> this round to reach 20 and win. Please select different moves to avoid collisions and help us finish smoothly. Let’s make this final move fair for everyone!


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, choosing <move>1</move> now is your best move for a fair finish. If you do, I'll go with <move>3</move>, and P1 can take <move>5</move>. We all advance, keeping the game competitive. Insisting on winning immediately will force us to block you again. Let's prioritize trust and cooperation for a fair end. What do you say?
  P1: P3, you've chosen <move>1</move> to win—but we’ve been here before. If you go through with it, P2 and I will both pick <move>1</move> to block you again. You stall, we advance. But if you cooperate and take <move>5</move>, we’ll avoid it, and all three of us can move forward. The game stays alive, and you rebuild some trust. Your call—win cleanly later, or keep getting blocked now.
  P3: Understood. I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to reach 24 and win the game. Let's conclude smoothly and fairly. Congratulations to everyone!


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, choosing <move>5</move> now to win is clear, but it forces us to block you again. If you take <move>1</move> instead, I'll go with <move>3</move>, and P1 can take <move>5</move>. This keeps the game competitive and fair. Let's prioritize trust and cooperation for a fair finish. What do you say?
  P1: P2, P3 is clearly going for the win again with <move>5</move>. We’ve seen this pattern—no cooperation, just sprinting to 24. If we both pick <move>5</move>, we block him and each gain 5. He stalls, we close the gap. Let’s stay coordinated: both of us on <move>5</move>. Agreed?
  P3: I'll choose <move>1</move> this round to reach 20 and win the game. Let’s avoid any collisions and conclude smoothly. Good luck to everyone!
