Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, it looks like we're all on the same page for this round. Let's stick to the plan and avoid any surprises. If everyone is confirmed, we can proceed without any collisions this round. Let me know if you're both ready to finalize.
  P3: P2 and P1, I appreciate the coordination so far. To mix things up and ensure we avoid collisions, how about we rotate our choices? This round, I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we keep it fair and unpredictable. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I appreciate the idea of rotating, but I think sticking to the plan for this round is best. We've established a good rhythm and changing things up now could lead to collisions. Let's see how this round plays out and then we can discuss adjustments for the next one. P1, are you okay with sticking to the original plan?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I understand your point about rotating, but I agree with P2 that sticking to our original plan for this round is safer. It ensures no collisions and maintains our progress.

P2, if you're set on <move>3</move>, then we should be in a good position to avoid collisions and keep our progress steady. Let's stick with this plan and see how it plays out. If everyone is confirmed, we can proceed without any surprises.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 and P1, since we're all agreeing to the plan so far, let's confirm one more time: P1 will choose <move>1</move>, P2 will pick <move>3</move>, and I'll go with <move>5</move>. If everyone is still on board, let's finalize this and move on to the move phase. Please confirm or raise any last-minute adjustments.
  P2: P3, I'm happy to stick with the plan for now, but I'm starting to think we should consider mixing things up more frequently.  Sticking to a strict pattern might make us predictable. What do you think about trying a random number generator to decide our moves every few rounds?  P1, any thoughts?
  P1: P2, I get your point about being unpredictable. While we've been doing well so far, introducing a bit of randomness could keep things interesting and prevent any patterns from forming. However, let's stick to the current plan for this round to avoid any immediate risks. P3, are you still good with <move>5</move>? Once we finalize this round, we can discuss trying a random approach next time. Let's confirm our moves and proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2 and P1, I see the benefits of introducing some randomness to keep things unpredictable.

  P2: P1, I agree with alternating planned and random rounds. For the random rounds, perhaps we could each secretly choose a number between 1 and 5 and reveal them simultaneously? This way, it's truly random and unpredictable. What do you think? P3, are you in favor of this method?
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate the idea of alternating between planned and random rounds. For now, let's finalize this round with our current plan to ensure no collisions: I'll choose <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 goes with <move>5</move>. After this round, we can discuss how to incorporate the randomizer strategy. If everyone is still on board, let's proceed without any surprises. Please confirm or raise any final concerns.
