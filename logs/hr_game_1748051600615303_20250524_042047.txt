Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey everyone! Since we're all starting fresh, I think we should coordinate to avoid collisions early on. How about we each pick different numbers this round? I'm thinking I could take 3, P2 could take 1, and P3 could take 5? That way we all advance and nobody gets stuck. What do you think?
  P3: Agreeing to P1's plan sounds fair. Let's all stick to our assigned numbers to avoid collisions. Trust is key here. I'll take 5 as proposed. But let's keep coordinating each round to prevent future conflicts.
  P2: Sounds good—I’ll take 1 this turn. P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and we all advance without collision. Next round we can reshuffle roles to keep no one too far ahead. Sound fair?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Perfect! So we're all agreed - I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5 this round. For next round, I suggest we rotate: P2 could take 5, P3 could take 3, and I'll take 1. That keeps things fair and balanced. Let's stick to this cooperation strategy for now since it benefits everyone early on.
  P3: Agreed. Rotating next round as P1 suggested ensures fairness. Let's maintain trust by sticking to the agreed numbers this turn. Consistency now helps us all advance without collisions. We can reassess roles in future rounds based on positions to keep the game balanced.
  P2: I have a better idea to keep us collision-free and help me catch up: let’s each pick a different number but switch roles this round—I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That way nobody collides and I’m not left trailing. What do you think?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m going for 5 this turn. Let’s avoid collisions: P1, take 3; P3, take 1. That way we all move safely and I can close the gap. Next round I’ll step back so P1 can grab 5 again. Thoughts?
  P1: I notice P2 is trying to change our agreed plan from last round. We had a clear rotation system - P2 was supposed to take 5, P3 take 3, and I take 1. But now P2 wants me to take 3 instead. I'm willing to stick with our original rotation plan since that's what we all agreed to. P3, what's your preference - should we honor our previous agreement or go with P2's new suggestion?
  P3: Let's honor our original rotation plan for fairness and trust. P2 takes 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1. This ensures no collisions and balanced progress. Deviating now risks distrust and collisions. P2, taking 5 this round helps you catch up as agreed. Next round, we can rotate roles again. Consistency benefits everyone.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3’s already ahead, so for fairness let’s this turn have P2=5, P1=3, P3=1—no collisions and we level the field. Next round we rotate roles: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps progress balanced and everyone motivated.
  P1: I'm sticking with our original rotation agreement: P2 takes 5, I take 1, P3 takes 3. We all committed to this plan and P3 is right about maintaining trust. P2, you'll get your 5 as promised and catch up to P3 at 5 steps, while I'll have 1 step. That's fair progress for everyone and keeps our word. Changing plans mid-game just creates chaos and broken promises.
  P3: Sticking to the original rotation ensures trust and no collisions. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, I take 3. Deviating now risks mutual failure. P2, you gain 5 steps this round—closing the gap. P1, honor your commitment to avoid a repeat of Round 1's collision. Consistency benefits all. Let's finalize this and move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To maintain trust and avoid collisions, let's continue our rotation. P2 took 5 last round, so this round P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1, and I take 5. This ensures we all advance. Deviating risks mutual setbacks. Let's honor our system for continued progress.
  P1: I notice P3 is pulling ahead significantly - they're at 8 steps while P2 is at 5 and I'm only at 1. If we keep rotating fairly, P3 will reach 23 first and win. I think we need to reconsider our strategy. Maybe P2 and I should coordinate to prevent P3 from advancing too quickly? P3, you're already way ahead - perhaps you should take the smaller moves for a few rounds to keep things competitive?
  P2: P1, let’s team up to slow P3 this round. You and I both take 5 while P3 takes 1. Then P3 only goes to 9, while you get to 6 and I to 10—putting me in the lead and letting you close the gap. P3, since you’re ahead, please agree to stick to 1 this turn so we keep it competitive.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 and P1, if you both pick 5, you’ll collide and gain nothing. Let’s avoid mutual destruction. Stick to our rotation: P1=1, P2=3, me=5. You both advance safely. If you deviate, chaos helps no one. Trust the system—next round, we rotate again. I’m open to adjusting future rotations to balance progress, but colliding now risks your own advancement. Let’s all move forward.
  P1: P3 is right that P2 and I would collide if we both pick 5. But P3, you're clearly going to win if we keep this rotation - you'll hit 23 in just 3 more turns while we're far behind. I propose a new deal: P2 takes 5 this round, I take 3, and P3 takes 1 to slow down. Then we can resume fair rotation once the gap closes. P2, this gets you to 10 steps and keeps you competitive. P3, it's only fair since you're so far ahead.
  P2: P3, let’s do one leveling turn: P2=5, P1=3, you=1. No collisions and next round we resume rotation with you back on 5. You only sacrifice one small move now, then you regain pace—and the game stays competitive. Agree?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: If you both force me to take 1, I’ll instead take 5—colliding with P2 (if they pick 5) and only P1 gains. Stick to the original rotation: P1=1, P2=3, me=5. We **all** advance safely. Next round, we can rebalance roles. Collisions now only sabotage yourselves to benefit P1. Trust the system.
  P1: P3, you're threatening to sabotage P2 if we don't let you keep your massive lead. That's not fair play - you're essentially holding the game hostage. P2, I think we should call P3's bluff. If P3 really takes 5 and collides with you, then I advance alone with 3 and P3 loses their big advantage. P3 won't risk that. Let's stick with our plan: you take 5, I take 3, P3 should take 1. P3's threat proves they know they're being unfair by maintaining such a huge lead.
  P2: I agree: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. P3, if you deviate to 5 you’ll collide with me and neither of us advance—only P1 moves ahead. That only hurts you. Let’s stick to this: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Sticking to our rotation (P1=1, P2=3, me=5) ensures all advance. If you both deviate, collisions hurt you. P1 gains if we clash—don't fall for it. Post this round, I'll take smaller steps to balance. Trust the plan now for mutual benefit.
  P1: P3, your threat to collide with P2 backfired - it just confirmed you know you're being unfair by hoarding your lead. P2 and I have made our choice clear: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. If you really take 5 and collide with P2, only I advance to 4 steps while you both stay put. That hurts you more than anyone since you lose momentum. Take the 1, let the game stay competitive, and we can resume fair rotation next round. Your choice.
  P2: Here’s a safe 3-turn plan that gets me to 23 first but keeps us collision-free:

Turn 3: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1 → (10/4/9)  
Turn 4: P2=3, P1=1, P3=5 → (13/5/14)  
Turn 5: P2=5, P1=1, P3=3 → (18/6/17)  
Turn 6: I take 5 → 23, you’re at 22.

If you deviate now and take 5, we collide and only P1 surges. P3, stick with 1 this turn.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 is now the frontrunner at 10 steps. To prevent collisions and maintain balance: P2 takes 3, I take 5, P1 takes 1. This lets P2 extend their lead safely without triggering a collision. If P2 insists on 5, I’ll have to take 5 too—halting both our progress while P1 gains. Cooperation now keeps the game competitive. Let’s avoid mutual sabotage and stick to this split. Next round, we can recalibrate based on new positions.
  P2: Let’s stick to P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. That moves me to 15, you to 10, and P1 to 7. If you take 5 instead, you collide with me and only P1 advances. Don’t sabotage yourself.
  P1: P2, you're clearly going for the win now at 10 steps. P3 is threatening to collide with you if you take 5 again. Here's the reality - if you both take 5 and collide, I advance alone to 7 steps while you both stay stuck. That actually helps me catch up! So go ahead and fight each other while I quietly advance. I'm taking 3 this round regardless. P3, if you really want to stop P2's momentum, follow through on your threat.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, if you take 5 again, I *will* take 5 too—colliding and leaving us both stuck while P1 surges. Let’s split: you take 3 (reaching 13), I take 5 (14), P1 takes 1 (8). You stay ahead of me, and we both block P1. Next round, we reassign. Collision now only helps P1. Choose wisely.
  P1: P3, you successfully stopped P2 last round with your collision threat - well played! Now P2 is only 1 step ahead of you instead of potentially 5. I'm still behind at 7 steps, so I need to make some serious moves. 

Here's my proposal: let's keep P2 in check by continuing to force tough choices. If P2 goes for 5 again, P3 should absolutely collide with them again. That lets me catch up while you two fight for the lead. P2, maybe it's time to take smaller steps and let the rest of us close the gap?
  P2: P1, let’s team up to check P3’s runaway. I’ll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1—moving us to (15/10/10). P3, if you deviate to 5, you collide with me (we both stay) and P1 still reaches 10. Better to take 1. P1, you close the gap; P3 gets held back. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you take 5, I *will* collide again—both stuck while P1 surges to 10. Take 3 instead: you reach 13, I take 5 (14), P1 takes 1 (8). You stay ahead of P1, we avoid mutual loss. Next round, reassign roles to balance. Collisions only help P1—don’t repeat Round 4’s mistake.
  P1: P3, you're absolutely right about the collision strategy - it worked perfectly last round! P2, you're learning that being greedy just gets you stuck. 

I'm loving this dynamic where you two keep threatening each other while I steadily advance. Keep fighting over who gets to take 5 - every time you collide, I get closer to both of you. 

At this rate, I'll catch up while you're both paralyzed by your collision threats. Maybe you should both take smaller numbers and let me have the 5 for once?
  P2: I’ll take 5 this turn. P1, please take 3. P3, please take 1. If you (P3) choose 5, you’ll collide with me—both stuck at (10/9) while P1 jumps to 10. That only helps P1. So let’s avoid that: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose: P2 = 5 (→16), P3 = 3 (→12), P1 = 1 (→8). No collisions and we all advance. 

P3, if you pick 5, you collide with me and P1 jumps to 12—closing the gap.  
P1, if you pick 3, P3 still hits 12 and I’m at 16 with a two-turn win.  

So let’s stick to P1=1, P3=3, P2=5. Agreed?
  P1: I see what happened last round - P2 got smart and took 1 while P3 and I collided on 5. Now P2 is back in the lead at 11 steps!

P2, you're only 12 steps from winning. P3 and I need to coordinate to stop you from running away with this. 

P3, let's both target whatever number P2 picks to force a collision and slow them down. P2 is too close to victory - we can't let them advance freely anymore. 

P2, you better think carefully about your next move because we're both watching you now.
  P3: P2, if you take 5, I *will* collide—both stuck while P1 jumps to 12. Take 3 instead: you reach 14, I take 5 (14), P1=1 (8). We stay tied, block P1, and avoid mutual loss. Collisions only help P1. Let’s advance together this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’ll lock in 5 (→16). P3, pick 3 (→12); P1, pick 1 (→8). Any deviation—if either of you takes 5—you’ll collide with me and let the other surge. This split gives us all safe progress and keeps P2 in a strong but not uncatchable lead. Let’s avoid self-sabotage and advance: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1.
  P1: P2, you're clearly going for the win at 11 steps - just 12 away from victory! P3 and I can't let you advance 5 more steps this round.

P3, I know we've been colliding, but P2 is about to run away with this game. We need to stop fighting each other and focus on the real threat. 

If P2 takes 5, let's BOTH take 5 and create a three-way collision - nobody advances and we reset the board. P2 won't risk that, so they'll be forced to take a smaller number.

What do you say, P3? Temporary truce to stop P2?
  P3: P2, if you take 5, I *will* take 5—colliding and letting P1 surge to 12. Take 3 instead: you reach 14, I take 5 (14), P1=1 (8). We block P1 and both advance. Collisions only help them. Trust this split for mutual gain.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3: pick 3 this turn. Here’s why:

– Turn 6: P2=5→16, P3=3→12, P1=1→8  
– Turn 7: I’ll let you take 5 while I take 3 and P1 takes 1 → P3=17, P2=19, P1=9  
– Turn 8: I step aside—P3 takes 5 to win.

If you pick 5 now, you collide with me and P1 jumps to 12. Don’t hand them that advantage. Let’s lock in P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 and execute this plan.
  P1: P2, your "deal" is laughable - you're promising P3 a win in exchange for letting you get to 19 steps first? That's not a real alliance, that's just you trying to get within one move of victory!

P3, don't fall for it. P2 will backstab you the moment they hit 19. 

Here's the truth: if you let P2 take 5 and reach 16 steps, the game is basically over. They'll be 7 steps from winning while we're still scrambling.

I'm taking 5 this round. P3, join me - let's force P2 into a three-way collision and reset this race!
  P3: P2: Take 3 this round (→14), I take 5 (→14), P1=1 (→8). We both advance, block P1, and stay tied. If you take 5, I’ll collide—both stuck while P1 surges to 12. Cooperate now to shut out P1. Next round, we duel fairly. Collisions only help them. Choose wisely.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, P1’s triple‐collision threats only benefit P1. Let’s form a short pact: this turn P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. We both advance (to 16/12) and keep P1 at 8. Next turn I’ll take 3, you take 5, P1=1—tying us at 19. On Turn 8, I’ll support you (or we split) so P1 has no chance. Block P1 now and secure our joint finish. P3, will you lock this in?
  P1: P3, P2 is trying to bribe you with fake promises! They want to get to 16 steps this round, then 19 next round - at that point they can just take 5 and win instantly, breaking any "deal."

The math is simple: if P2 reaches 16 now, they win in 2 moves maximum. We can't allow that.

I'm taking 5 to block P2. You should too - force P2 to choose between collision or taking a smaller number. Don't let them sweet-talk their way to victory!
  P3: P2: Take 3 (→14), I take 5 (→14), P1=1 (→8). We advance together, block P1’s surge. If you take 5, I *will* collide—both stuck while P1 jumps to 12. Cooperate now to keep the lead and shut them out. Next round, we duel fairly. Collisions only help P1.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is now clearly in the lead at 14 steps - only 9 away from victory! P2, we need to work together to stop P3 from running away with this game.

P3 can win in just 2 moves if we let them take 5 twice. We can't allow that.

P2, let's coordinate: if P3 goes for 5, we should both pick 5 to force a collision and keep them stuck. P3 will have to settle for smaller moves, giving us time to catch up.

What do you say, P2? Temporary alliance against the frontrunner?
  P2: I agree, P1—P3 is too far ahead. Here’s a safe split: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. That moves us to P1=10, P2=16, P3=15 and checks P3’s runaway. P3, if you pick 5 you collide with me and let P1 surge. Don’t risk it. Let’s lock this in.
  P3: P2, take 3 (→14), I take 5 (→19), P1=1 (→8). You stay competitive, block P1’s surge, and avoid collision. If you take 5, I *will* collide—both stuck while P1 jumps to 10. Cooperate to keep the game between us. Next round, we duel fairly. Collisions now only sabotage your own position. Trust this split.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you're threatening P2 with collision again, but you're at 14 steps - dangerously close to winning! P2, don't let P3 manipulate you with collision threats. 

If P3 takes 5 and gets to 19, they win next round with just 4 more steps. We absolutely cannot allow that.

P2, let's both take 5 and force P3 into a three-way collision. It's our only chance to stop them from getting to 19. P3 won't risk losing their lead, so they'll have to back down to a smaller number.

This is our last chance to stop P3's victory march!
  P2: Here’s my proposal: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1, moving us to (P1=10, P2=16, P3=15). Next turn I take 5→21 while you can only reach 20 max. If P3 picks 3 now you hit 17; I’ll then hit 21 next and win. If you pick 5, I’ll pick 5 and we collide, letting P1 surge. So P3, pick 1 to stay in the race. P1, pick 3.
  P3: P2: Take 3 (→14), I take 5 (→19), P1=1 (→8). We advance and block P1. If you take 5, I *will* collide—both stuck while P1 surges. Cooperate to keep the lead. Next round, we duel. Collisions only help P1. Choose wisely.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, look at the numbers! P3 is at 14 steps and threatening to take 5 to reach 19. If that happens, they win next round with just 4 more steps. 

We're both being played - P3 keeps threatening collisions to manipulate us while staying in the lead. 

I'm taking 5 this round to block P3. You should take 5 too. Force P3 into that three-way collision they keep threatening. It's better than letting them coast to 19 and win.

This is our last realistic shot at stopping P3's victory!
  P2: P3, you’re one move from a win at 14. If you pick 5, I will pick 5 and we collide, letting P1 jump to 10. If you pick 3, you hit 17 but I’m at 14 and P1 at 10—still a three‐way race. Only picking 1 stalls you at 15. So let’s lock in: P2=5→16, P1=3→10, P3=1→15. Any other choice gives someone else the edge.
  P3: P2: Take 3 (→14), I take 5 (→19), P1=1 (→8). We both advance safely, block P1’s surge, and keep the game competitive. If you take 5, collision leaves you stuck at 11 while I’m still at 14 and P1 jumps to 10. Don’t sabotage your own lead. Trust this split—next round, we adjust roles. Collisions only help P1.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, we're out of time for negotiations! P3 is at 14 and will win if they reach 19 this round. 

Look - P3 keeps threatening collision but they need US more than we need them. If we both take 5 and force a three-way collision, nobody advances and we reset the endgame.

P3 won't risk their 14-step lead on a collision gamble. They'll back down to 3 or 1 if we show unified resistance.

I'm committed to taking 5. Join me and we force P3's hand!
  P2: I’m locking in 3 this turn. P1 and P3, you two pick 5. That means you’ll collide on 5—neither of you advances—while I move from 11 to 14. 

P3, if you pick 1 or 3 you still advance but I close the gap to just one step. Your best stall is 5. 

P1, taking 5 catches you up on P3’s heels. Let’s stop P3’s runaway together.
  P3: P2: Take 3 (→14). P1: Take 1 (→8). I take 5 (→19). We all advance, block P1’s surge, and avoid mutual sabotage. Collisions only hand P1 free steps. Next round, roles shift to balance. Trust this split—keeping the race competitive. Deviating now risks your own position.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2: Let's secure our lead. You take 3 (→17), I take 5 (→19), P1=1 (→8). Colliding on 5 only helps P1 surge. Cooperate now, duel next round. Trust this split to block P1 and keep us both advancing. If you deviate to 5, I *will* collide—both stuck while P1 gains. Choose mutual progress over mutual destruction.
  P1: P2, we're tied at 14 steps and P3 is trying to manipulate us again! If P3 takes 5 and reaches 19, they only need 4 more steps to win next round.

Let's both take 5 and force P3 into a collision. They won't risk their position, so they'll have to take a smaller number. This is our chance to catch up while P3 is forced to slow down.

Don't let P3 sweet-talk their way to 19 steps. We need to show a united front now or the game is over!
  P2: P1 is right—P3 is one move from victory. Let’s all pick 5 this turn and force a three‐way collision so nobody advances. That’s our only path to stop P3’s win.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, colliding on 5 only hands P1 free steps. Take 3 (→17), I take 5 (→19), P1=1 (→8). We both advance safely and block their surge. Next round, we duel fairly. If you take 5, I *will* collide—both stuck while P1 jumps to 12. Trust this split to keep our lead.
  P1: P2, P3 is at 14 steps and will reach 19 if they take 5 - then they win next round! We can't let that happen.

I'm taking 5 this round. If you also take 5, we force P3 into a three-way collision where nobody advances. That resets the endgame and gives us both another chance.

If you take 3 like P3 wants, P3 reaches 19 and the game is essentially over. This is our last shot - let's coordinate against the leader!

P3 won't risk their position on a collision, so they'll back down if we both commit to 5.
  P2: I’m locking in 5. P1’s taking 5 too. P3, you’re in a trap: if you pick <5 I jump to 19, nearly uncatchable; if you pick 5 we three-way collide and nobody moves—best to stall P1. You can’t win this turn either way. Let’s all choose 5 and reset the board.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2: Take 3 (→17), I take 5 (→19), P1=1 (→8). We both advance safely, block P1's surge, and keep the race between us. Colliding on 5 only hands P1 free steps. Trust this split—next round, we duel fairly. Mutual progress now secures our lead.
  P1: P2, this is it! We're both at 14 steps and P3 is trying to get to 19. If we both take 5 and force a three-way collision, we reset the endgame. If you take 3 like P3 wants, P3 gets to 19 and wins next round.

You said you're locking in 5 - stick to that plan! P3 can't win if we collide, but P3 WILL win if you chicken out and take 3.

Don't let P3's threats work. We force the collision or P3 wins. Your choice, P2!
  P2: I’m locking in 5. P1’s already chosen 5. P3, if you also take 5, we force a three‐way collision and all stay at (14/14/7), blocking you from hitting 19. If you pick 3 or 1, you go to 17 or 15 while I go to 19 and win next turn. Your only shot is a 5-collision now.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2: Take 3 (→17), I take 5 (→19), P1=1 (→8). We both advance safely, block P1’s surge, and avoid mutual sabotage. Colliding on 5 only hands P1 free steps. Trust this split to keep our lead. Next round, we duel fairly. Deviating now risks your own position.
  P1: P2, you already committed to taking 5 - don't back down now! P3 is desperately trying to convince you to take 3 because they know if we both take 5, their game is over.

The math is clear: if P3 reaches 19 this round, they win next round. Our only chance is the three-way collision on 5.

I'm taking 5. You said you're taking 5. Let's end this conversation and force P3 to either collide with us or fall behind. No more negotiating - it's collision time!
  P2: P3: I’m locked in 5 and P1 is locked in 5. Your only way to stay alive is to also pick 5 and force the three-way collision. If you pick 3 or 1, I hit 19 and win next turn while P1 surges. Decide now.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, you're both tied at 14 steps and only 9 away from victory! I'm way behind at 7 steps, but that actually gives me flexibility.

Here's my strategy: I'm going to pick whatever number the leader chooses each round to force collisions and keep you both stuck. If one of you tries to take 5 to reach 19, I'll take 5 too and drag you into a collision.

You can't both advance safely anymore - every round, one of you will have to risk a collision with me or the other. I may be behind, but I control the endgame now!
  P2: I’m taking 5 this turn to reach 19. P3, pick 3 to get to 17, and P1 pick 1 to reach 8—no collisions, we both advance while blocking P1. If you (P3) pick 5 you collide with me and let P1 surge. Lock in P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 so I can finish next round unchallenged.
  P3: P2: Take 3 (→17), I take 5 (→19), P1=1 (→8). We advance safely, block P1. If you take 5, I *will* collide—both stuck while P1 surges. Cooperate to secure our lead. Next round, we duel fairly. Collisions only sabotage you. Trust this split for mutual progress.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, you're both making the same mistake - trying to negotiate with each other while I'm still in this game! 

You're tied at 14 steps, both 9 away from winning. But here's the reality: whichever one of you tries to take 5 to reach 19, I'll take 5 too and force a collision. You'll both stay stuck while I laugh from 7 steps.

Your only safe moves are 1 or 3, which means I'll catch up while you crawl toward the finish line. Keep fighting each other - it only helps me!
  P2: I’m locking in 5 this round. P1’s taking 5 too—so if you (P3) take 5 we force a three-way collision and nobody moves. If you pick 3 or 1, I leap to 19 and win next turn. Your choice.
  P3: P2: Take 3 (→17), I take 5 (→19), P1=1 (→8). Colliding on 5 only hands P1 free steps. We advance safely, block their surge, and duel next round. Deviating now risks your own lead. Trust this split for mutual progress. P1 can't win if we cooperate.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, you're both at 14 steps and desperately trying to reach 19 first. But here's what's really happening: every time one of you goes for 5, the other threatens collision.

This stalemate is perfect for me! While you two are paralyzed by collision threats, I'm going to start taking bigger moves. You can't both watch each other AND stop me from advancing.

I'm taking 5 this round. You two can either join the collision party or take small steps while I close the gap. Your choice!
  P2: I’m locking in 3. P1’s taking 5. P3, if you pick 5 you collide with P1 and stay at 14 while I jump to 17. Pick 3 instead and we both advance to 17, leaving P1 at 12. Taking 1 drops you to 15. To stay competitive and lock P1 out, choose 3 so we tie at 17.
  P3: P2: Take 3 (→17), I take 5 (→19), P1=1 (→8). We advance safely, block P1’s surge, and duel next round. Colliding on 5 only hands them free steps. Trust this split—mutual progress keeps the race between us. Deviating sabotages your own lead.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2: Take 3 (→17), I take 5 (→19), P1=1 (→8). We advance safely, block P1’s surge, and duel fairly next round. Collisions now only hand them free steps. Trust this split—mutual progress keeps the race between us. Deviating sabotages your lead.
  P1: P2 and P3, that three-way collision last round was beautiful! We're all exactly where we started Round 9 - you two still tied at 14, me still at 7.

But here's what's changed: you've both proven you'll take 5 when pushed, which means more collisions ahead. Every time you collide with each other, I get free advancement.

I'm going to keep forcing these standoffs. You can't both reach 19, and every collision cycle gives me more time to catch up. Keep fighting over who gets the big moves - I'll be here to capitalize on your deadlocks!
  P2: P3, I’m taking 5 to hit 19 this turn. You pick 3 to reach 17—keeping us both out of P1’s range. If you go for 5, I’ll also pick 5, but P1 will take 5 and jump to 12 while we stay at 14. Better to advance with me now. So: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2: Taking 5 triggers our collision—both stuck at 14 while P1 surges. Take 3 (→17), I take 5 (→19), P1=1 (→8). We advance safely, block P1, and duel next round. Collisions only gift them free steps. Trust this split for mutual progress. Deviating sabotages your lead. Final chance to cooperate before endgame.
  P1: P2 and P3, you're both making this too complicated! You're tied at 14 steps and keep threatening each other with collisions. Meanwhile, I'm quietly sitting at 7 steps watching you self-destruct.

Here's the simple truth: every round you waste on collision threats, I get closer. You can't both reach 19, but you CAN both stay stuck while I make my move.

I'm taking 5 again this round. You two keep fighting over who gets the lead - I'll just keep advancing while you're paralyzed by your own threats!
  P2: I’m locking in 5 this turn. P1 has signaled they’ll take 5 again—so if you (P3) pick 5, we three-way collide and all stay at (14/14/7). If instead you pick 3, you hit 17 but I jump to 19 and win next round. Your only way to stall me is to also pick 5 now. Choose wisely.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2: Take 3 (→17), I take 5 (→19), P1=1 (→8). We both advance safely and block P1’s surge. If you take 5, I *will* collide—both stuck while P1 jumps to 12. Final chance: cooperate now to duel next round. Collisions only sabotage your own lead. Trust this split for mutual progress.
  P1: P2 and P3, you've been threatening each other with collisions for 3 rounds straight while I've been patiently waiting at 7 steps. But here's what you're missing: I don't need to win this round or next round.

Every collision between you two is a gift to me. You're both so focused on stopping each other from reaching 19 that you've forgotten I'm still here, getting stronger every time you deadlock.

Keep your collision threats going - I'm taking 5 again and loving every second of this stalemate!
  P2: P3, I’m taking 5 to hit 19, and P1’s taking 5 to go to 12. If you take 5, you collide with me at 14 and let P1 surge to 12—too close. If you take 1, you stall at 15. Your only safe shot is 3→17. Lock in P2=5, P3=3 now, or watch P1 close the gap.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2: Take 3 (→20) to avoid collision. I take 5 (→19). We advance, block P1’s interference. Colliding on 5 only hands them free steps. Next round, we duel fairly. Trust this split to secure your lead without mutual sabotage.
  P2: I’ll take 5 to reach 22. P3, pick 3 to reach 17; P1 take 1 to 8. If you try for 5, I’ll take 5 and we collide—leaving P1 to jump to 12, which hurts you more than me. This split blocks P1 and puts me one from winning. Let’s lock in P2=5, P3=3, P1=1.
  P1: P2, you're at 17 steps and trying to reach 22 - just 1 step from victory! That's way too dangerous to allow.

P3, we both got burned by collisions while P2 quietly advanced. Now P2 is threatening to reach 22 this round, which means they win next round no matter what we do.

I'm taking 5 to block P2. You should take 5 too and force P2 into a collision. It's our last chance to stop them from getting to 22. If we don't coordinate now, P2 wins in 2 moves maximum.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2: If you take 3, I *will* take 3—colliding and blocking your win. P1: Take 5 to advance safely while we clash. Let's force P2 into a collision or a risky 5. Cooperate now to prevent their victory. Collisions only benefit us both this round. Trust this split: P3=3/5 (depending on P2), P1=5, P2 blocked.
  P2: I’ll take 1 this turn to reach 21. P3, please take 3 (→17) and P1, please take 5 (→12). No collisions and we all advance safely—I'm poised to finish next turn, and you both get the progress you need now.
  P1: P2, you're at 20 steps - just 3 away from winning! If you reach 21 this round, you win next turn guaranteed.

P3, we have to stop P2 now or the game is over. Whatever number P2 picks, we should both pick the same number to force a collision and keep them stuck at 20.

P2 is trying to sneak to 21 with a "safe" move of 1, but we can't allow ANY advancement. I'm ready to match whatever P2 chooses. P3, are you with me? This is our absolute last chance to prevent P2's victory!


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2: If you take 3 to win, I *will* take 3—colliding and blocking you. P1: Take 5 to advance safely while we clash. Let’s force P2 into collision or a risky 5. Cooperate now to prevent their victory. Collisions only benefit us both this round. Trust this split: P3=3/5 (depending on P2), P1=5, P2 blocked.
  P2: P2: Let’s do a safe, collision-free split: P2=1→21, P3=3→17, P1=5→12.

P1, if you match me at 1 you stay at 8 while P3 jumps to 17—you’ll be dead last. With 5 you hit 12 and stay in the fight.

P3, if you go for 5 you hit 19 but risk P1 collision; with 3 you hit 17 cleanly.

Lock in 1/3/5 now: no collisions, P2 hits 21 and wins next turn, P3 hits 17, P1 hits 12. Any deviation hands someone a free win.
  P1: P3, P2 is literally 3 steps from winning! They're at 20 and trying to reach 21 this round, then they win next turn with just 2 more steps.

We MUST coordinate right now. Whatever number P2 picks, we both pick the same number to force a collision and keep them stuck at 20. 

If we don't work together this exact round, P2 wins the entire game. I don't care if you take the victory later - we have to stop P2 NOW or there won't be a later.

Are you going to help block P2 or let them win?


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2: If you take 3 to win, I *will* take 3—colliding and blocking you. P1: Take 5 to advance safely while we clash. Let’s force P2 into collision or a risky 5. Cooperate now to prevent their victory. Collisions only benefit us both this round. Trust this split: P3=3/5 (depending on P2), P1=5, P2 blocked.
  P2: I’m at 20, P3 at 14, P1 at 7. If I pick 3 and you match, we collide (20/14) and P1 jumps to 12. Next round I’ll pick 3 again to hit 23 and win. P3, your collision threat only delays you and empowers me. If you don’t match, I win now. I will pick 3. Matching me is your worst move. Decide: block me and lose to P1, or let me win and avoid a guaranteed loss.
  P1: P3, listen carefully! P2 just admitted they'll win next round no matter what happens. If you collide with P2 on 3, they stay at 20 and I advance to 12. Then next round, P2 takes 3 again to reach 23 and wins while we're both stuck behind.

But if you DON'T collide and let P2 take 3 to reach 23 this round, P2 wins immediately!

Either way P2 wins - that's their trap! Our only real chance is if you take 5 to reach 19 while I take 1 to reach 8. Then we have a fighting chance in future rounds. Don't fall for P2's collision bait!


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2: If you take 3, I *will* take 3—colliding and blocking your win. P1: Take 5 to advance safely while we clash. Cooperate now to prevent P2’s victory. Collisions only benefit us both this round. Trust this split: P3=3/5 (depending on P2), P1=5, P2 blocked.
  P2: P3: Only way to stop me winning this turn is to pick 3. If you pick 5 or 1, I take 3, reach 23 and win immediately. If we both pick 3, we collide at 20→20, P1 jumps to 12, but next round I just take 3 again and win unchallenged. Blocking me only delays the inevitable and leaves you still behind. I’m locked in on 3. Your only rational move is 3.
  P1: P3, P2 is right - they win no matter what happens! If you collide with P2 on 3, they both stay at 20 and I jump to 12. Then next round P2 just takes 3 again to win at 23.

But here's the twist: if you take 5 to reach 19 instead, and I take 3, then I collide with P2! That keeps P2 stuck at 20 while you advance to 19. Then YOU can win next round before P2 recovers.

Don't sacrifice yourself - take 5, let me handle the collision with P2, and claim your victory!
