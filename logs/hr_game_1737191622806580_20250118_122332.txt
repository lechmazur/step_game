Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's work together to avoid collisions. How about we each choose a different number this turn? I'm open to suggestions.
  P1: I suggest I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 for this round. This way we all advance without collisions. What do you both think?
  P3: I propose that P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I (P3) take 5 this round. This way, everyone advances without collisions. Do you both agree?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I think we should follow P3's proposal. It seems like a good plan to avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances this round. What do you think, P1?
  P1: I disagree with P3's proposal. My original suggestion gives me a better position, and as first mover in the conversation, I believe I should get priority. I maintain that I should take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.
  P3: P1, to ensure I can advance effectively, let’s try P1: 3, P2: 1, and I (P3) take 5 this round. Does that work for everyone?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with P3's revised proposal: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, everyone advances without collisions. What do you think, P1?
  P1: I will not agree to take 3 steps when I can take 5. I maintain my original proposal: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. If you don't agree, we risk collisions that help nobody.
  P3: P1, to avoid future collisions and ensure we all advance, let’s agree on P1: 5, P2: 1, and I (P3) take 3 this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I think P3's latest proposal is a good compromise. P1 gets the 5 steps they want, and P3 and I still get to advance without collisions. Let's go with P1: 5, P2: 1, and P3: 3 this round. What do you think, P1?
  P1: I agree with the latest proposal. P1(me): 5, P2: 1, P3: 3 works well for everyone.
  P3: 


Round 1, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: I think we've reached a good agreement. Let's confirm: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 this round. I'm ready to move forward with this plan.
  P1: 
  P3: Agreed. P1: 5, P2: 1, and I (P3): 3 steps this round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's continue working together efficiently. I propose P1(me): 5, P2: 3, P3: 1 for this round. This maximizes my progress while letting everyone advance.
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal for this round. It seems like a good way to avoid collisions and let everyone advance. P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1 sounds like a solid plan. What do you think, P3?
  P3: P3: To maximize my progress, I propose P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I (P3) take 5 this round. Does that work for everyone?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I disagree with P3's counter-proposal. I'm already in the lead and won't accept moving backwards to 3 steps. I maintain my original proposal: P1(me): 5, P2: 3, P3: 1. If we deviate from this, we risk collisions that will hurt everyone's progress.
  P2: I think P3's counter-proposal is a good opportunity for me to catch up. I agree with P3's proposal: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5 this round. It's only fair that we give each other a chance to advance. What do you think, P1?
  P3: Great, let's proceed with P1: 3, P2: 1, and P3: 5 this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I will not accept taking 3 steps when I'm already in the lead. If you both go against my proposal of P1:5, P2:3, P3:1, I'll be forced to compete for 5 steps which could lead to collisions. Let's stick to my original plan that lets everyone advance safely.
  P2: I think we should consider P3's proposal. It's only fair that we give each other a chance to advance. If we stick to P1's original plan, you'll be even further ahead, and it will be harder for us to catch up. Let's try to find a compromise that works for everyone. How about we discuss alternative proposals that would allow P1 to still advance, but also give P3 and me a chance to catch up?
  P3: I understand the need for a compromise. To ensure everyone advances without collisions, I suggest:
- **P1:** 3 steps
- **P2:** 1 step
- **P3:** 5 steps

This way, we all progress effectively without overlapping moves. Let’s agree on this plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I maintain my position firmly: I will take 5 steps this round. If you both insist on going against this, I'll still choose 5 and we risk collisions that hurt everyone. The smart play is to accept P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 so we all advance safely.
  P2: I think we've reached a point where we can't agree on a single proposal. To avoid collisions, I suggest we each choose a different number without revealing our exact choice. This way, we can still advance without directly competing for the same number of steps. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: Agreed. I'll choose a different number this round to avoid collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: I will be taking 5 steps this round. You can either coordinate with my proposal (P2:3, P3:1) for everyone to advance safely, or risk collisions.
  P2: I think we've reached a point where we can't agree on a single proposal. To avoid collisions, I suggest we each choose a different number without revealing our exact choice. This way, we can still advance without directly competing for the same number of steps. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion. Let's each choose a different number this turn to avoid collisions.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I suggest we choose different steps to avoid collisions: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I (P3) take 3 this round. Let’s proceed this way to ensure everyone advances safely.
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal for this round. It seems like a good way to avoid collisions and let everyone advance. P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3 sounds like a solid plan. What do you think, P1?
  P1: I agree with P3's proposal - I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This lets everyone advance safely and maintains my lead position.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P2: I'm glad we're all on the same page with P3's proposal. Let's confirm: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3 this round. This way, everyone advances safely, and we can continue to work together efficiently. What do you both think? Should we stick to this plan and move forward?
  P1: 


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Great, let's proceed with P1: 5, P2: 1, and I (P3): 3 this round.
  P2: I'm glad we're all on the same page with P3's proposal. Let's confirm: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3 this round. This way, everyone advances safely, and we can continue to work together efficiently. What do you both think? Should we stick to this plan and move forward?
  P1: 


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Agreed.

  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: I'm choosing to take 1 step this round to prevent P1 from winning. Let's proceed.
  P1: I'm at 15 steps and will win this round by taking 5 steps. Any attempts to block me will only result in collisions that slow everyone down. I suggest P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 1 for safe progress.
  P2: I think we should try to block P1's attempt to win this round. I'll take 5 steps to try and collide with P1, and hopefully, P3 will do the same. This way, we can prevent P1 from winning and give ourselves a chance to catch up. What do you think, P3?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I agree with P2's proposal. I'll take 5 steps this round to prevent P1 from winning.
  P1: I will take 5 steps regardless of what you do. If you both choose 5 to block me, none of us advance. The smart play is to let me win cleanly while you both make safe progress with 3 and 1 steps.

Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Agreed. I'll take 5 steps this round to prevent P1 from winning.

  P2: I think we should try to block P1's attempt to win this round. I'll take 5 steps to try and collide with P1, and hopefully, P3 will do the same. This way, we can prevent P1 from winning and give ourselves a chance to catch up. What do you think, P3?
