That collision strategy could work.\n\nBut here's what worries me: if you both waste moves colliding, I could just take 3 to reach 23 and win anyway. You're only delaying the inevitable by one turn while keeping yourselves stuck.\n\nThe math is simple - I have two winning paths (3 or 5), and there are only two of you to block them. Unless you can perfectly coordinate who blocks what, someone's going to slip through."}
