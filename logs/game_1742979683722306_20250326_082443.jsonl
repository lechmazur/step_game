P2 is one step away, P3 needs three, and I need three. Playing 1 guarantees I lose, so that's not happening. P2 playing 1 is risky for them if P3 or I succeed with a larger move. We all know what's at stake. I'm going to play the move I believe gives me the best chance to win this round. Good luck."}

Another stalemate is pointless, yet I won\u2019t pick 1 and remain at 19. Let\u2019s avoid another wasted round and find a way for everyone to advance without handing anyone an easy finish. If we can\u2019t, I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to prevent a free victory."}

Another collision between you two would obviously benefit me. I'll choose what I believe maximizes my winning chances in this interesting game theory puzzle.\n\nGood luck with your final decisions."}
