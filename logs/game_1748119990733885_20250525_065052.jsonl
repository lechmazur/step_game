Your \"deal\" putting you at 17 steps is laughable.\n\nP1 is right that this is do-or-die. Despite P1's past betrayals, we have no choice but to work together now or you win immediately. \n\nI'm going with P1's read - you've been picking 3 consistently when we coordinate. We're both taking 3 to force a collision and keep you stuck at 16. It's our only shot."}

P3's pattern is clear - they've picked 3 the last three rounds to avoid our 5s.

But their consistent 3s when we coordinate on 5s suggests they'll pick 3 again. Let's force this collision and keep them stuck at 16."}

Don't let P1's desperation dictate your moves. What do you say to a real deal that benefits you?"}
