P1 and P3 have an unbreakable alliance for a shared win this round. My options are: take 1 and advance to 17, or collide and stay at 16 while crowning one of them solo winner. \n\nSince I cannot win regardless, I'll maximize my score. I'm taking 1 this round. At least I gain points rather than spitefully giving someone else a solo victory while I gain nothing. \n\nP1 and P3, enjoy your shared win. I'll take my 1 point and move on."}
