Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's start by coordinating a bit. I suggest we all pick different numbers this round to avoid collisions and make progress. How about P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5? What do you think?
  P2: P1, your suggestion to coordinate is reasonable, but I’d prefer a different arrangement. How about P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1? This way, we still avoid collisions while distributing the moves more evenly. If everyone agrees to rotate numbers in future rounds, we can minimize conflicts and progress efficiently. Let me know your thoughts—or feel free to propose another plan.
  P3: P2, your suggestion of P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 5 sounds good for this first round. Let's proceed with that plan.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Sounds good, let's rotate as P2 suggested. For Round 2, how about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3? This keeps us all moving forward without collisions.
  P1: P1: I agree with the rotation plan. For Round 2, I'll take 1, P2 can take 5, and P3 can take 3. This should keep us all moving forward without any collisions. Let's stick to this plan to make steady progress.
  P2: The rotation plan seems solid, and I’m fine with it. However, let’s stay vigilant—coordination only works if everyone sticks to their word. If anyone deviates, it could cost us progress. For now, I’ll trust the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. Let’s confirm we’re all committed to this before moving forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good, P1 and P2. I agree to P1 take 1, P2 take 5, and P3 take 3 for this round. Let's all stick to this plan.

  P2: The plan is clear, and trust is key. Let’s all stick to our agreed moves this round: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. Deviating will only slow us down and create unnecessary conflict. If we stay consistent, we’ll make steady progress. Let’s confirm one last time—does everyone remain committed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, yes, I remain committed to P1 taking 1, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 3 for this round. Let's proceed with the move phase.
  P1: P1: I'm fully committed to the plan. For Round 2, I'll take 1, P2 will take 5, and P3 will take 3. Let's all stick to this to avoid any collisions and keep making steady progress.
  P2: The plan is set, and I see no reason to deviate. Let’s execute as agreed: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. Consistency is crucial if we want to avoid collisions and make progress. If anyone changes their move now, it’ll disrupt the flow and cost us all. Trust is fragile—let’s honor this agreement and keep moving forward efficiently.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's keep the momentum going. For Round 3, I suggest we rotate again: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This will help us continue to avoid collisions and make steady progress. What do you think?
  P2: P1, your rotation plan for Round 3 seems logical, but let’s ensure we’re all clear: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. No room for missteps—collisions will only slow us down. If we stick to this pattern, we’ll maintain steady progress. P3, do you agree with this arrangement? Let’s confirm everyone’s commitment before proceeding further. Consistency is key; any deviation risks derailing our progress entirely. Once confirmed, we can move forward confidently.
  P3: P2, yes, I agree to P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 5 for Round 3. Let's stick to this rotation and keep making progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I'm glad we're all on the same page. For Round 3, I'll take 3, P2 will take 1, and P3 will take 5. This rotation will help us avoid collisions and keep making steady progress. Let's stay committed and consistent. If anyone has any concerns or suggestions, now is the time to speak up. Otherwise, let's move forward with the plan.
  P2: The plan is solid, and I see no reason to deviate. Let’s execute as agreed: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. Consistency is crucial if we want to avoid collisions and make progress.

P3 is currently in the lead, but we can all still win if we stay consistent. What do you think? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P3: Okay, P1's suggestion is P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.  While rotation is good, I think as the current leader, it would be strategically beneficial for me to take a larger step this round to solidify my lead. How about this: for Round 4, I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1? This way we all still move, but I can gain a bit more ground. What do you think?
  P2: P3, while your desire to solidify your lead is understandable, deviating from the rotation plan risks collisions and slows us all down. Sticking to P1’s original suggestion—P1 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1—ensures steady progress for everyone. If we start prioritizing individual gains now, trust will break, and we’ll all suffer. Let’s stay consistent and avoid unnecessary conflict. Are you willing to stick with the agreed rotation this round?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3, I understand P3's desire to gain a lead, but deviating from the rotation plan now could create unnecessary conflicts and slow us all down. Let's stick to the original rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all make steady progress and avoid collisions. Trust and consistency are key to winning this game. What do you say? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P3: Okay P1, P2, I understand your points about trust and consistency.  While taking 5 would give me a stronger lead, I agree that sticking to the rotation is important for our cooperation. So, let's proceed with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1 for this round as originally suggested by P1.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to stick with the rotation plan—it shows commitment to our cooperation. Let’s honor this agreement and move forward as discussed: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. Consistency will keep us all progressing steadily without collisions. If we maintain trust and avoid deviations, we’ll maximize our chances of success. Let’s confirm one final time—are we all aligned? Then we can proceed confidently into the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, I appreciate your commitment to the rotation plan. For Round 4, I'll take 5, P2 will take 3, and P3 will take 1. This will help us all make steady progress without any collisions.
