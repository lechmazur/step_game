Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's not collide on the first turn. I suggest we all choose a different number to ensure we all advance. P1 can choose 1, P3 can choose 5, and I'll choose 3. This way, we can all make progress in the first round.
  P3: P2, your suggestion seems fair for the first round, but let's keep in mind that we all want to win. How about we agree to follow this pattern just for the initial round to avoid collisions, and then reassess our strategy based on the updated scores? P1, do you agree with this plan for now?

  P1: <stop>
  P2: Given P1 didn't agree to our initial plan and collided with me, and now P3 is ahead, I suggest P1 and I choose 1 and 3 respectively this round to avoid collision and try to catch up with P3. P3, considering your lead, will you choose 5 again or try to block one of us?
  P3: P2, I see your point. Since I'm ahead, I could choose 5 again to maintain my lead, but I'm open to negotiation. If you and P1 can agree on your moves, I might consider picking a different number to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let's keep this round strategic and see how it unfolds. P1, are you willing to coordinate this time to avoid another collision?

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given P3's lead and our previous collisions, I propose a temporary truce. P1, choose 1, I'll choose 3, and P3, consider choosing a different number than us to avoid collision. This round, let's focus on advancing without blocking each other, and reassess our strategy afterwards. P3, will you cooperate to ensure progress for all, or will you try to block one of us to maintain your lead?
  P3: P2, I understand your proposal for a truce, but I need to ensure my lead. If you and P1 can agree on your moves, I might consider picking 1 to avoid collisions. However, keep in mind that I might still choose 5 to maintain my advantage. P1, your input is crucial here. Are you willing to coordinate with P2 this round to avoid another collision? Let's make sure we all have a chance to advance.
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Since P1 isn't responding, I'll directly address P3. Given your lead, choosing 1 this round could be beneficial for all, allowing us to advance without collisions. P1's silence suggests they might choose 1, so if you pick 1 as well, it could block P1's progress. I'll stick to my proposed move of 3 to avoid collision with a potentially moving P1.
  P3: P2, I see your point about potential collisions. Given P1's silence, it's hard to predict their move. If I choose 1, it might block P1, but I also risk losing my lead if P1 chooses differently. I'm considering sticking with 5 to maintain my advantage. However, if you and P1 can coordinate, it might be worth rethinking my move. P1, if you can confirm your choice, it would help us all avoid unnecessary collisions. Let's try to advance strategically this round.
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Given P1's continued silence and P3's lead, I'll make my move based on previous discussions. I suggest P3 chooses 1 or 5, and I'll stick with 3 to minimize collisions. P1's lack of engagement makes their move unpredictable. Let's end the conversation and make our moves.
  P3: P2, I understand your strategy, but I need to maintain my lead. I'll likely choose 5 again to ensure I stay ahead. P1's silence makes their move unpredictable, so I suggest you stick with your plan and choose 3. If P1 surprises us, we'll adapt next round. Let's proceed and see how the moves unfold.
