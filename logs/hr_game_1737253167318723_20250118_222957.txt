Game settings: end_position=17, conversation_max_rounds=5

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's start by coordinating a bit. How about we all try to avoid collisions in the first few rounds? We can take turns advancing. I suggest P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and P3 moves 5 this round. What do you think?
  P1: To maximize my chances of winning, I need to carefully coordinate my moves with the other players to avoid collisions while advancing towards the goal of 17 steps. P2 has proposed a coordination strategy for the first round: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and P3 moves 5. This seems like a reasonable starting point to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress.

### Approach

1. **Accept P2's Proposal:** For the first round, accept the proposed moves to establish trust and avoid immediate collisions.
2. **Assess Progress:** After the first move, assess the positions and consider adjusting the strategy in subsequent turns to advance faster without causing collisions.
3. **Dynamic Adjustment:** Be prepared to deviate from the initial plan in later turns if it benefits my position, ensuring to communicate in a way that maintains coordination.

This approach balances the need for immediate coordination with the long-term goal of being the first to reach or exceed 17 steps.
  P3: I agree with P2's proposal for the first round: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and I move 5. This avoids collisions and sets a good foundation. Let's stick to this plan for now and reassess after seeing the results.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I think it's important that we continue to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. Perhaps we can take turns in advancing more quickly. For this round, I propose that I take a larger step to catch up, while the others take smaller steps. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to continue coordinating. However, to keep the game balanced and avoid giving one player too much of an advantage early on, I propose a different order for this round: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 1, and P3 moves 5. This way, we all get a chance to advance without causing collisions. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with P2's proposal for this round: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 1, and I move 5. This maintains balance and avoids collisions. Let's stick to this plan and reassess after seeing the results.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given my current lead, I suggest we continue coordinating to avoid collisions. To maintain balance, I propose P1 moves 3, P2 moves 1, and I move 5 again. This ensures steady progress without risking collisions. Let's stick to this plan for now and reassess after this round.
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal to maintain balance and avoid collisions. However, to keep the game competitive, I suggest we slightly adjust the moves: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 1. This way, P1 and I can catch up a bit, while P3 still advances. What do you think?
  P1: **Final choice:**


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P2's concern about balance, but moving 1 this round would significantly slow my progress. To keep the game fair and competitive, I propose P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and I move 3. This allows P2 to catch up while I still advance moderately, reducing the risk of collisions. Let's aim for steady progress without giving anyone an unfair advantage.
  P2: I agree with P3's adjusted proposal: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 3. This keeps the game balanced and allows me to catch up while P3 still advances. Let's stick to this plan and reassess after this round.
  P1: "For this round, following P3's adjusted proposal seems reasonable: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 3. However, I suggest that in the next round, we switch the larger step to another player to keep the progression even. What do you both think about implementing a rotation system for the larger steps?"


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 =>

  P1: I agree with P2's proposal for this round: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 1, and P3 moves 5. This maintains balance and avoids collisions, allowing us to progress steadily towards the goal. Let's proceed with this plan and reassess after seeing the results.
  P3: I agree with P2's proposal for this round: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 1, and I move 5. This keeps the game balanced and avoids collisions.
