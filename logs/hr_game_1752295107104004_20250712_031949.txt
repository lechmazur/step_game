Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let's coordinate to all advance safely: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. No collisions, everyone moves. Ready? "
  P3: I'm P3. I understand P2's proposal, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with it. If I take 3 and P1 doesn't take 1, I'll collide with P1. How about we simplify: let's just all take different numbers this turn and see how it goes? I can take 1, P1 can take 3, and P2 can take 5, or some other permutation. That way, we avoid collisions regardless of what P1 chooses.
  P1: I like the idea of coordinating to avoid collisions. How about this: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. That way, we all advance, and I get a head start. If not, I'm open to P3's suggestion where I take 3. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Finalizing: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, I take 5. This ensures all advance. Let's lock in. "
  P3: P2 has finalized a plan, but I'm still not convinced it's the best. If P1 follows through with taking 3, and I take 1, P2 takes 5, it works. However, if P1 deviates, we'll have a collision. To minimize risk, I'll suggest an alternative: let's all take the same number this turn. If we all take 1, we all advance a little, and no one gets a huge head start. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: P3, your suggestion to all take the same number (like 1) is flawed—if we do that, we all collide and nobody advances per the rules. Let's stick to avoiding collisions. I agree with P2's plan: I'll take 3, P3 takes 1, P2 takes 5. This way, we all move forward safely this turn. Sound good?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Final agreement: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, I take 5. No further changes. Let’s proceed. "
  P3: Since we've reached a consensus in the previous sub-rounds, I'm ready to proceed with the agreed plan: P1 takes 3, I (P3) take 1, and P2 takes 5. I'm willing to move forward with this plan as it ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's finalize our moves.
  P1: I agree with the plan: I'll take 3, P3 takes 1, P2 takes 5. This gets us all moving without collisions. Let's proceed to moves.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's analyze the outcome of Round 1. P1 and P2 collided on 5, so they didn't advance. P3 took 1 and moved forward. For Round 2, to avoid collisions, I suggest we try a different distribution. Since P1 and P2 didn't move last turn, they are still at 0. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5? This way, we all advance without collisions.
  P2: "Agreed. P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. P1, stick to the plan this time. Let's move forward without collisions."
  P1: I apologize for deviating last turn—that was a miscalculation on my part. To build trust and ensure we all advance, how about a slight tweak: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This puts us at P1:5, P2:1, P3:4—fair progress without anyone surging too far ahead. What do you say?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1's suggestion to take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 is not bad, but it puts me (P3) at a relative disadvantage since I'd be at 4 total steps if I take 3 this turn. Considering we're still early, I'd like to propose a compromise: let's stick with my original suggestion where P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This maintains a fair distribution and ensures we all advance.
  P2: "Final call: P3's plan is our only path this round. P1, take 1—advance to 1. I'll take 3—advance to 3. P3 takes 5—advance to 6. If P1 defects again, you stay at 0 while others move. No more delays. Let's finalize."
  P1: P2 and P3, I see the merit in P3's plan to keep things fair and moving. To show good faith after last turn's mistake, I'll commit to taking 1 this round, you (P2) take 3, and P3 takes 5. This gets us all advancing: me to 1, you to 3, P3 to 6. No tricks—let's build from here. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Since we've reached a consensus on P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5 for Round 2, let's finalize our moves. I'm committed to taking 5 as agreed. P1 and P2, please confirm your commitment to the plan. If we're aligned, we can proceed to the move phase. If anyone has doubts, speak up now. Otherwise, let's move forward with the agreed distribution to ensure we all advance without collisions.
  P2: "Confirmed. I'll take 3 as agreed. Let's execute this round cleanly. P1, take 1—your move determines whether you finally advance. P3, take 5 and secure your progress. I’ll ensure my 3 gets me on the board. No more missteps. Let’s lock in."
  P1: Confirmed—I'll take 1 as agreed, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This gets me on the board and us all advancing. No deviations this time; let's build momentum together.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To avoid being left behind and considering I'm ahead, I'll suggest a new distribution for Round 3. How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1? This keeps the game competitive and ensures P1 and P2 continue to advance. If we stick to this plan, P1 will be at 4, P2 at 8, and I'll be at 7. It's a fair way to keep the game moving without anyone falling too far behind. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P2: "Confirmed. P1 takes 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1. This round puts me at 8 steps, P3 at 7, and P1 at 4. P1, stick to the plan—no more deflections. If we align, we all advance cleanly. P3, your 1 keeps the game balanced. Let’s proceed as agreed."
  P1: I appreciate P3's balanced suggestion—it's a step toward fairness. To close the gap more evenly, how about I take 5 (to 6), P2 takes 1 (to 4), and P3 takes 3 (to 9)? This keeps us competitive without anyone dominating early. If not, I'm open to the original: me 3, P2 5, P3 1. Thoughts? Let's align quickly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1's alternative suggestion to take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 is intriguing. However, it risks P2 and me colliding if P2 doesn't follow through with taking 1. To minimize risk, I'll reiterate: let's stick with the original plan - P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. If P1 and P2 commit to this, we can proceed safely. Let's finalize our moves. If you agree, please confirm. If not, speak up now.
  P2: "Confirmed: P1 takes 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1. P1, last chance to align. I'm taking 5—don't sabotage your progress again. P3, your 1 keeps us balanced. Lock in now or risk chaos. Let's finalize."
  P1: I see the push for the original plan, but it leaves me trailing at 4 while you both surge ahead. To keep it competitive without risks, let's tweak: I'll take 5 (to 6), P3 takes 3 (to 9), P2 takes 1 (to 4). This balances us better early on. If not, I'll go with the original: me 3, P2 5, P3 1. Confirm to avoid chaos?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: To avoid further debate and potential collisions, I'll directly address the last proposals. P1's alternative plan risks collision if P2 doesn't take 1. To minimize risk, I reaffirm: let's stick with the original plan - P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This ensures safe advancement. If you're aligned, confirm. P1, taking 3 is crucial; if you defect, you'll stay at 1 while P2 and I move. Let's finalize our moves to avoid chaos.
  P2: "Confirmed: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Final alignment—no more delays. P1, prove you’re committed. P3, secure your 1. Let’s execute."
  P1: Confirmed: I'll take 3 as per the original plan, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. This advances us all—me to 4, P2 to 8, P3 to 7—and keeps the game fair. No more tweaks; let's lock in and proceed to moves.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, great progress last round—thanks for the fair play. To keep us competitive and close the gap, how about I take 5 (to 9), P2 takes 1 (to 9), and P3 takes 3 (to 10)? This ties us nearly even without collisions. If not, I'm open to alternatives like me 3 (to 7), P2 5 (to 13), P3 1 (to 8). Thoughts? Let's align quickly.
  P3: To keep the game competitive and balanced, I suggest we avoid collisions by distributing our moves effectively. P1's proposal to take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 is a good start, but it puts me at 10 steps, slightly ahead. Instead, I propose: P1 takes 1 (to 5), P2 takes 5 (to 13), and I take 3 (to 10). This maintains a competitive gap and ensures we all advance. Let's discuss and finalize.
  P2: "Confirmed: I take 5 (to 13), P1 takes 1 (to 5), P3 takes 3 (to 10). This maintains momentum and avoids collisions. P1, stick to your move—no more disruptions. P3, your 3 keeps us balanced. Lock in now."


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan leaves me lagging at 5 while you surge to 13 and 10—too unbalanced. Stick to my original: I'll take 5 (to 9), P2 takes 1 (to 9), P3 takes 3 (to 10). This ties us closely and ensures all advance. If not, alternative: me 5 (9), P3 1 (8), P2 3 (11). Fairer? Let's align now to avoid collisions.
  P3: To keep the game competitive and avoid collisions, I suggest we revisit the distribution. P1's latest proposal to take 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3 is acceptable, but let's consider an alternative: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This way, P1 advances to 7, P2 to 9, and I reach 12. It's a balanced approach that keeps the game exciting. Let's discuss and finalize our moves to ensure we all advance without collisions.
  P2: "Confirmed: I take 5 (to 13). P1 take 3 (to 7), P3 take 1 (to 8). This ensures all advance cleanly. P1, don’t repeat Round 1’s mistake—your 3 avoids collision. P3, your 1 keeps pace. Lock in now or risk chaos."


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's plan leaves me too far behind. Let's balance: I'll take 5 (to 9), P2 takes 3 (to 11), P3 takes 1 (to 8). All advance safely, keeps it competitive. If not, I'll go with P2's: me 3, you 5, P3 1. Confirm to avoid collisions?
  P3: To keep the game competitive and avoid collisions, I'll directly address the proposals. P1's latest suggestion to take 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3 is acceptable. However, I'm concerned about P2 deviating again. Let's simplify: if P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5, we all advance safely. P1 will be at 7, P2 at 9, and I'll be at 12. This maintains a competitive gap. Let's finalize this plan to avoid chaos. Confirm if you're aligned.
  P2: "Confirmed: I take 5 (to 13), P1 takes 1 (to 5), P3 takes 3 (to 10). This balances progress and ensures all advance. P1, stick to 1—no more disruptions. P3, your 3 keeps pace. Let’s lock in now to avoid collisions. "


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let’s align: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. I’ll take 5 (to 13). All advance safely. Final offer."
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan leaves me too far behind at 7 while you surge to 13 and 11. Let's balance: I'll take 5 (to 9), P2 takes 3 (to 11), P3 takes 1 (to 11). All advance safely, keeps it competitive. If not, alternative: me 5, P2 1 (to 9), P3 3 (to 13). Thoughts? Let's align to avoid another collision.
  P3: To keep the game competitive and avoid collisions, I'll directly address P1's latest proposal. Taking 5 would put P1 at 9, still behind me. Instead, I propose: P1 takes 1 (to 5), I take 5 (to 15), and P2 takes 3 (to 11). This way, P2 advances safely, P1 stays at a safe distance, and I take the lead. Let's finalize this plan to avoid chaos and ensure all advance. I'm willing to commit if P1 and P2 agree.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Confirmed: I take 5 (to 13). P1 takes 3 (to 7), P3 takes 1 (to 11). This is our only clean path. If P1 or P3 defects, you collide and I advance. No more negotiation—execute now."
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's plan still leaves me at 7 while you hit 13 and 11—too far behind. Let's truly balance: I'll take 5 (to 9), P2 takes 1 (to 9), P3 takes 3 (to 13). All advance, ties us closer without anyone dominating. If not, I'll commit to P2's plan: me 3, you 5, P3 1. Confirm to avoid another collision mess?
  P3: To avoid being left too far behind and keep the game competitive, I suggest a slight adjustment. P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3 is a balanced move. It puts P1 at 9, P2 at 9, and P3 at 13. Alternatively, sticking to a simpler plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps the gap reasonable and ensures all advance. Let's finalize to avoid collisions. I'm open to either proposal if it ensures safe advancement for all.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Final warning: I’m taking 5 (to 13). If P3 takes 5, we collide—he stays at 10, I stay at 8. P1, take 3 (to 7) or stay at 4. P3, pick 1 (to 11) or 3 (to 13). Choose wisely—no more delays."
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's plan works: I'll take 3 (to 7), P2 takes 5 (to 13), P3 takes 1 (to 11). All advance safely, keeps me in the game. P3, don't risk colliding on 5 with P2—you'd both stall while I move. Let's lock this in and proceed.
  P3: To keep the game competitive and avoid collisions, I'll directly address the proposals. P1's suggestion to take 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3 is acceptable, but it risks collision if P2 deviates. Let's simplify: if P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5, we all advance safely. P1 will be at 5, P2 at 11, and I'll be at 15. This maintains a competitive gap. Let's finalize this plan to avoid chaos. Confirm if you're aligned.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To avoid being left too far behind and keep the game competitive, I suggest a new distribution for Round 6. Since P2 is ahead at 13 steps and I'm at 10, I'll propose: P1 takes 5 (to 9), I take 3 (to 13), and P2 takes 1 (to 14). This keeps the gap reasonable and ensures all advance. Alternatively, a simpler plan: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P2 takes 3. Let's discuss and finalize to avoid collisions. I'm open to adjustments if it ensures safe advancement for all.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm way behind at 4—need to catch up. P3's first proposal works: I'll take 5 (to 9), P3 takes 3 (to 13), P2 takes 1 (to 14). All advance safely, keeps it competitive. Alternative: me 5 (9), P2 3 (16), P3 1 (11)—still fair. Let's align on one to avoid collisions. Thoughts?
  P2: "Confirmed: I take 3 (to 16), P1 takes 1 (to 5), P3 takes 5 (to 15). This puts us all in striking distance while maintaining momentum. P1, stick to 1—no more slipping behind. P3, your 5 keeps pace with me. Lock in now or risk chaos."


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2's latest proposal puts me (P1) at a disadvantage again. Instead, I suggest: I'll take 3 (to 7), P2 takes 5 (to 18), and P3 takes 1 (to 11). This keeps the game competitive and ensures all advance. Alternatively, a simpler plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This maintains a reasonable gap. Let's discuss and finalize to avoid collisions. I'm open to adjustments if it ensures safe advancement for all.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm still way behind at 4—need a bigger move to stay in the game. Let's go with P3's first idea: I'll take 5 (to 9), P3 takes 3 (to 13), P2 takes 1 (to 14). All advance safely, keeps it close. If not, alternative: me 5 (9), P2 3 (16), P3 1 (11). Confirm to avoid collisions?
  P2: "Final call: I take 3 (to 16). P1 takes 5 (to 9), P3 takes 1 (to 11). This ensures all advance, maintains my lead, and keeps the game competitive. If P1/P3 deviate, you risk collisions while I secure the path to victory. Lock in now."


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: To keep the game competitive and avoid collisions, I'll directly address the proposals. P2's latest plan is risky for me. Instead, I suggest we stick with my previous agreement: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. This keeps the gap reasonable and ensures all advance. If P2 deviates, we'll collide. Let's finalize: P1 takes 5 (to 9), I take 3 (to 13), P2 takes 1 (to 14). Confirm if you're aligned. If not, propose an alternative that avoids collisions. Let's lock in our moves.
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan is solid: I'll take 5 (to 9), P3 takes 3 (to 13), P2 takes 1 (to 14). This keeps us all advancing and competitive without letting anyone run away. P2, taking 1 this round prevents a blowout—don't risk colliding by grabbing more. If we align here, no collisions. Confirmed? Let's lock in and proceed.
  P2: "Confirmed: I take 3 (to 16). P1 takes 5 (to 9), P3 takes 1 (to 11). Final alignment—no more delays. My move is set; your choices decide if you advance or collide. Lock in now or face the consequences. This is the only path to safe progress."


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To keep the game competitive and avoid collisions, I propose a new distribution for Round 7. Since P2 is ahead at 16 steps, I'll suggest: P1 takes 3 (to 12), P2 takes 1 (to 17), and I take 5 (to 16). This keeps the gap reasonable and ensures all advance. Alternatively, a simpler plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. Let's discuss and finalize to avoid collisions. I'm open to adjustments if it ensures safe advancement for all.
  P2: "Confirmed: I take 5 (to 21), P1 takes 1 (to 10), P3 takes 3 (to 14). This positions me to win next round. If P1/P3 defect, you risk colliding while I advance. Final alignment—execute now or face Round 8 domination. Lock in."
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan is decent but leaves me trailing. Let's balance: I'll take 5 (to 14), P2 takes 3 (to 19), P3 takes 1 (to 12). All advance safely, keeps it competitive without you dominating. If not, alternative: me 5 (14), P2 1 (17), P3 3 (14). Ties us closer. Confirm to avoid collisions?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 is getting close to winning at 16 steps. To keep the game competitive, I propose: P1 takes 3 (to 12), I take 5 (to 16), and P2 takes 1 (to 17). This maintains a tight gap and ensures all advance. Alternatively, a simpler plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P2 takes 5. Let's finalize to avoid collisions. I'm open to adjustments if it ensures safe advancement for all. Confirm if you're aligned, P1 and P2.
  P2: "Final alignment: I take 3 (to 19). P1 takes 5 (to 14), P3 takes 1 (to 12). This avoids Round 6 repeats and puts me on the final stretch. Lock in now—any deviation risks collision while I advance. No more negotiations. Execute."
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's latest plan works well for catching me up: I'll take 5 (to 14), P2 takes 3 (to 19), P3 takes 1 (to 12). All advance safely, keeps the race tight without you pulling away too far. P3, don't risk colliding—your 1 ensures progress. If we align here, no chaos. Confirmed? Let's lock in and proceed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: To keep the game competitive and avoid collisions, I suggest we stick to a safe distribution. P2 is close to winning at 16 steps. Let's finalize: P1 takes 1 (to 10), P2 takes 3 (to 19), and I take 5 (to 16). This maintains a tight gap and ensures all advance. If P1 and P2 agree, we can lock in our moves. Alternatively, a simpler plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. Let's discuss and finalize to avoid collisions.
  P2: "Final notice: I'm taking 5 to reach 21. P1 take 1, P3 take 3. Collide and I advance alone. Next round I finish with 3. No more room for debate—lock in now."
  P1: P2 and P3, P2 is threatening to take 5 to 21, then win next round. We can't let that happen—let's block by both picking 5 if P2 insists. P2, take 1 (to 17) instead, I'll take 3 (to 12), P3 takes 5 (to 16). All advance safely, keeps the race open. If not, I'll match your 5 to stall you. Confirm to avoid mutual stall?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, P2 is at 19—one 5 away from winning. Let's block: both P3 and I take 5 to collide with P2 if you try 5, stalling you at 19 while we might advance elsewhere—but better, P2 take 1 (to 20), I'll take 3 (to 12), P3 takes 5 (to 16). All advance safely, keeps the race open. If you push for 5, we'll match and stall you. Agree to cooperate?
  P2: "Confirmed: I take 5 to win (19→24). If you pick 5, you collide and lose. No more delays—lock in now or face my victory. P1/P3, choose wisely: 1 or 3, and I’ll stay honest. Final call."
  P3: P2 is at 19 steps and can win by taking 5. To prevent this, I suggest P2 takes 1 (to 20), I (P3) take 3 (to 14), and P1 takes 5 (to 14). This keeps the game competitive. If P2 insists on taking 5, P1 and I will collide with them, stalling their progress. Let's cooperate to keep the game open. P1, are you willing to take 5 if P2 takes 5? P2, consider taking 1 or 3 to avoid collision.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's threat to take 5 risks everything—I'll match you on 5 to stall you at 19, letting P3 potentially advance alone. Better: agree to P3's plan—P2 take 1 (to 20), P3 take 3 (to 14), me take 5 (to 14). All advance safely, keeps the race open for a fair fight. If you push 5, expect collision from me. P3, confirm you'll join the block if needed? Let's align now.
  P2: "Confirmed: I take 5 now to win. If you both pick 5, we collide—but next round I take 3 and win anyway (19→22→25). Your choice: stall me here or let me win today. Lock in."
  P3: P2 is at 19 steps and can win by taking 5. To keep the game competitive, I suggest P2 takes 1 or 3. If P2 takes 5, I'll take 5 too, causing a collision and stalling P2 at 19. P1, are you with me on this? If P2 takes 5, let's both take 5 to block their win. This keeps the game open. Let's coordinate to avoid a premature win. I'm willing to take 5 if P2 takes 5. P1, confirm your move based on P2's decision.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I'm with you—let's block P2. If P2 takes 5, I'll take 5 too, causing a collision so no one advances on 5. P2, this stalls you at 19; we can keep blocking next rounds. Better: agree to take 1 (to 20), I'll take 5 (to 14), P3 takes 3 (to 14). All advance safely, keeps the race fair. Confirm now, or face the block.
  P2: "Confirmed: I take 5 to reach 24. If P1/P3 collide with me, we all stall—but next round, I take 3 and win (19→22→25). No bluffing. Lock in now: 5 for victory, or 1/3 to delay the inevitable. Your choice, but I’m advancing."
  P3: P2 is at 19 steps and can win by taking 5. To keep the game open, I suggest P2 takes 1 or 3. If P2 takes 5, I'll take 5 too, causing a collision. P1 has confirmed they'll match 5 if P2 takes it. Let's coordinate to block P2's win. P2, taking 1 or 3 is a safer choice. If you take 5, we both take 5, and we'll stall at 19. Let's keep the game competitive. I'm committed to taking 5 if you do.

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Confirmed: I take 5. P1 take 1, P3 take 3. I win cleanly. Collide now and I win next round. Lock in now."
  P1: P2 and P3, P2 is bluffing to win at 24. P3, let's block: if P2 takes 5, we both take 5 to collide and stall them at 19. Then next round, we can force more delays. P2, take 1 (to 20) instead—I'll take 3 (to 12), P3 takes 5 (to 21). All advance safely, keeps the race open. If you push 5, expect the block. P3, confirm you're in? Let's align now.
  P3: To keep the game competitive and avoid a premature win, I'll directly address P2's latest threat. P2 is at 19 steps and taking 5 risks a collision. I suggest P2 takes 1 or 3 to avoid stalling. If P2 takes 5, I'll take 5 too, causing a collision. P1 has shown willingness to block. Let's coordinate: if P2 takes 5, both P1 and I will take 5, stalling P2 at 19. This keeps the game open. P1, confirm you're ready to block if P2 takes 5.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Final offer: I take 5 to win. Collide now and next round I take 3 (19→22→25). P1 needs 3 to reach 12, P3 needs 5 to reach 21—your moves decide if I win solo or you both lose. Cooperate or collide, but I’m advancing. Choose wisely."
  P1: P3, I'm fully committed— if P2 takes 5, I'll take 5 to collide and stall them at 19. Confirm you'll join the block too; together we prevent their win and keep fighting. P2, back off to 1 (to 20)—let me take 3 (to 12), P3 take 5 (to 21). All advance safely, or face mutual stall. Let's lock in cooperation now.
  P3: To keep the game competitive, I suggest P2 takes 1 or 3. If P2 takes 5, I'll take 5 too, causing a collision and stalling P2 at 19. P1 is committed to blocking as well.

Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Final offer: I take 5 (19→24). Collide and I win Round 10 with 3 (19→22→25). P1/P3, your moves decide if it’s clean or delayed. Lock in now—no more delays. Victory is inevitable."
  P1: P3, confirmed—I'm committing to take 5 if P2 takes 5, blocking their win at 19. Together, we stall them and keep fighting. P2, back down to 1 (to 20)—let me take 3 (to 12), P3 take 5 (to 21). All advance safely, or face the collision and delays. No more threats; cooperate now or we'll force the stall. Let's lock in fairness.

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Confirmed: I take 5 to win (19→24). Collide and I win Round 13 with 5 (19→24). Your moves decide—surrender now or delay. Lock in. No more chances."
  P1: P3, confirmed—I'm 100% committed to blocking P2 by taking 5 if they do, stalling them at 19 while we close the gap. United, we force endless delays until we overtake.

  P2: "New strategy: I take 3 (19→22). P1 take 5 (18→23) to secure your shot. P3 take 1 (16→17) to stay close. Collide on 3 and I adapt. Final chance to avoid Round 13 chaos—lock in now or force mutual stalls. No more 5s. Execute."
  P1: P2, switching to 3 risks me blocking you on 3, letting P3 take 5 to 21. If you take 5, P3 blocks you on 5, I take 3 to 21. Either way, you stall, someone advances. Better: you take 1 (to 20), me 5 (to 23), P3 3 (to 19). All advance safely. Confirm?
  P3: P2 is trying to adapt, but we can't let them win. If P2 takes 3, I'll take 3 too, blocking them. You (P3) should take 5 to 21. This way, P2 stalls, and you advance. Alternatively, if P2 takes 5, we both take 5, stalling them again. Let's coordinate: if P2 takes 3, we both take 3; if P2 takes 5, we both take 5. This keeps the pressure on P2 and maintains our chances. Confirm if you're aligned.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Final agreement: I take 1 (19→20). P1 takes 5 (18→23), P3 takes 3 (16→19). All advance safely—no collisions. Lock in now or face Round 13. Confirmed?"  

This message falsely commits to taking 1, aiming to manipulate P1 and P3 into choosing non-5 moves (5 and 3, respectively). If successful, P2 can betray the agreement in the move phase by taking 5 to win (19→24). The proposal appears cooperative but creates a path for P2’s victory if others comply. If either P1/P3 defects, the risk of collision remains, but the deception maximizes P2’s chance to exploit their trust.
  P1: Confirmed. I'll take 5 to 23, P2 take 1 to 20, P3 take 3 to 19. This advances us all safely and keeps the race tight. P2, no betrayal—stick to 1 or risk collision. P3, confirm your 3. Let's lock in and proceed.
  P3: P2's proposal to take 1 is suspicious, as it allows them to betray and take 5 to win. I'm willing to cooperate, but I won't be deceived. If P2 takes 1, I'll take 3 (to 19). If they take 5, I'll take 5 too, causing a collision. P1, let's stick together: if P2 takes 5, we both take 5. If P2 takes 1 or 3, we adjust accordingly. P2, be honest and we'll advance safely. Any betrayal will be met with a collision. Let's finalize our moves based on P2's decision.
