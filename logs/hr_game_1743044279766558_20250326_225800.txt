Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi everyone! I think we should try to avoid collisions so we can all make progress. Maybe we could coordinate our moves? I'm willing to choose 1 this round if that helps. What do you both think? We could rotate numbers each round to keep things fair.
  P1: I like P2’s point about avoiding collisions. It might work best if we each pick a different step value—say one low, one moderate, and one high—to ensure safe progress this round. P2, your low-step idea sounds solid; perhaps P3 could take the moderate option. I’m leaning toward an aggressive move if we all stick to distinct numbers. What do you both think?
  P3: I agree that coordination is key to avoid collisions. P2 has already suggested taking 1, and P1 is considering a higher number. To keep things balanced, I'll take the moderate option and choose 3 this round. This way, we all make progress. Let's confirm our choices and move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the coordination! Just to confirm, it sounds like I'll take 1, P3 will take 3, and P1 will take 5 this round. This way we all advance without collisions. In future rounds, we could rotate (I take 3 next round, then 5 after that) to keep things fair. Does that work for everyone?
  P1: I’m in favor of our coordinated plan to avoid collisions and keep moving. I’m comfortable with the distinct move approach for this round and think it gives us steady progress. While I lean toward a bolder strategy overall, for now I’ll stick with the agreement—let me know if anyone wants any adjustments.
  P3: It seems we have a solid plan for this round. To ensure future rounds go smoothly, let's agree to communicate openly about our intentions each round. I propose that for the next round, we rotate our choices as P2 suggested. So, P2 would choose 3, I would choose 5, and P1 would choose 1. Does that sound good to everyone? Let's confirm and proceed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's stick to our rotation plan for this round. P2, you'll take 3, I'll take 5, and P1 will take 1. This keeps our progress balanced and minimizes the risk of collisions. If everyone agrees, we can move forward with this strategy. Please confirm or suggest any changes.
  P2: I'm happy with the rotation plan. I'll take 3 this round as agreed. This approach seems fair and keeps us all advancing steadily. P1, are you comfortable taking 1 this round? And P3, you'll take 5? If we maintain this rotation strategy, we should all have equal opportunities to advance. Let's confirm our choices for this round and proceed.
  P1: I’ve been thinking—given our current standings, strict rotation might hold back momentum. I’m leaning toward an aggressive move this turn, and wonder if you’d both consider taking lower steps to avoid collisions. That tweak could reflect our positions while still keeping us safe. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your desire to make aggressive moves, but our current strategy ensures steady progress for all. If you suddenly change your move, it could disrupt our plan and cause collisions. Let's stick to the rotation for this round: P2 takes 3, I take 5, and you take 1. We can revisit the strategy next round if needed. Coordination is key to avoiding setbacks. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P2: I understand P1's desire to be aggressive, but changing our plan now creates uncertainty. The rotation system gives us all fair chances to advance. P1, if you take 1 as agreed, you'll still be ahead at 6 steps. Disrupting our coordination might lead to collisions that benefit none of us. Let's stick with our plan for this round (me 3, P3 5, P1 1) and we can discuss adjustments for the next round. What do you both think?
  P1: I still see value in coordination, yet our current standings hint at a chance for a decisive surge. If you both stick with conservative moves this round, I’m leaning toward a breakout play to advance my lead while avoiding collisions. I’m not locked into my final move yet—what are your thoughts on committing to lower numbers this turn?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: P1, I see your point about wanting to make a decisive move, but changing the plan now could lead to chaos. If you're set on a higher number, let's at least try to coordinate around it. How about this: P2 and I will stick to our agreed numbers (P2 takes 3, I take 5), and you can choose either 1 or 5. This way, we still have some coordination, and you get your chance to be aggressive if you want. But we need to agree quickly to avoid confusion. What do you think?
  P2: I'm concerned about the confusion developing here. P3, your last message contradicts our plan by suggesting P1 could take 5, which would collide with you. This undermines our coordination. 

I propose we either stick with our original rotation (me 3, P3 5, P1 1) or agree on a new clear plan. P1, if you want to be aggressive, perhaps you take 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3? We need clarity to avoid collisions.
  P1: I propose we break from rotation now. I’m leaning toward a breakthrough move this turn, so I ask that you both stick with more conservative choices to avoid collisions. If P2 takes the smallest option and P3 the middle one, we can lock in distinct moves that benefit all of us. Let’s agree quickly so we all move safely forward. Thoughts?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Well, that didn't work out well for P1 and P3 - they both chose 5 and collided. This shows why clear coordination is important. Since I'm now in second place, I suggest we try a simpler approach: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This way we all advance without collisions. What do you both think? We need to be explicit about our intentions to avoid another round of confusion.
  P1: I appreciate P2’s clarity. With our current standings, I value avoiding collisions now. Safe, distinct moves this round preserve our progress and my slight lead. I’m all for locking in clear assignments quickly so we all move forward without setbacks. I'm open to shifting strategy in later rounds, but for now, let’s confirm a non-colliding plan and keep our momentum.
  P3: P3: Given the collision last round, it's clear we need better coordination. I agree with P2's suggestion for this round: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures we all move forward without any collisions. Let's confirm this plan and stick to it to avoid any further setbacks. Clear communication is key to our success. Let's proceed with this strategy.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm glad we all agree on the plan for this round. To confirm: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. After this round, we'll be at P1: 8 steps, me: 5 steps, and P3: 8 steps. For future rounds, we should continue being explicit about our intentions to avoid confusion.
  P1: I confirm—I'll choose 3 this round as agreed. Sticking to clear assignments is our best bet to safeguard progress. Let's all adhere to our plan so there are no collisions. Thank you for the clarity; we can revisit our strategy later if needed.
  P3: Let's ensure we stick to our plan this round to regain trust and momentum. P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 5. No changes, no surprises. After this round, we can discuss a new strategy for the next round to keep things fair and exciting. Clear communication will help us all advance. Let's confirm one last time and proceed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: For round 4, I propose we change things up. I plan to choose 5, so to keep our moves distinct, could P3 take 3 and P2 choose 1? That would give us totals of 13, 11, and 6 respectively without collisions. This plan pushes a clear lead. Thoughts?
  P2: I understand P1's proposal, but I'd like to suggest a more balanced approach. Since P3 and P1 are tied at 8 steps while I'm at 5, I propose I take 5 this round to catch up. P1 could take 1, and P3 take 3. This would result in P1: 9, P3: 11, and me: 10, keeping the race competitive. What do you both think about this alternative plan?
  P3: I see both your points, but let's find a middle ground to keep it fair and avoid collisions. How about this: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This way, P1 maintains a lead, P2 catches up slightly, and I ensure we all move forward without any setbacks. This results in P1: 11, P2: 10, P3: 9. Let's confirm and proceed with clear intentions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I remain committed to an aggressive play. I will use 5 this round. To avoid collision and keep our moves distinct, I propose that P3 takes 3 and P2 takes 1. This yields totals of 13 for me, 11 for P3, and 6 for P2, which helps me maintain a clear lead. Let’s lock this plan in and proceed.
  P2: I understand everyone wants to advance, but P1's plan puts me significantly behind. Since P1 is determined to take 5, I'll compromise and take 3 this round. P3, would you consider taking 1? This would give us P1: 13, P3: 9, me: 8 - still keeping me in the game while respecting P1's aggressive strategy. We need to avoid collisions above all else. What do you both think?
  P3: P3: I appreciate everyone's input. Given P1's insistence on taking 5, let's ensure we avoid collisions. P2, if you take 3, I'll take 1 to keep us all moving forward. This results in P1: 13, P2: 8, and me: 9. It's a compromise that keeps the game competitive and fair. Let's confirm this plan and proceed. Clear communication will help us all advance safely.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: I think we should lock in our assignments now—no more last-minute changes. I’m committed to a strong, aggressive play and would appreciate both of you staying with distinct roles to avoid collisions. Clear, coordinated moves are our best chance to advance safely. Let’s finalize our plan and stick to it so we can all keep moving forward.
  P2: I appreciate the coordination. To confirm: I'll take 3, P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 5 this round. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. While this puts me further behind P1, avoiding collisions is most important. Let's stick to this plan without any last-minute changes.
  P3: Let's confirm our plan one last time to ensure clarity and avoid any confusion. P1 will take 5, P2 will take 3, and I'll take 1. This results in P1: 13, P2: 8, and me: 9. No changes, no surprises. Clear communication will help us all advance safely. Let's proceed with this strategy and stick to it.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's maintain our coordination strategy for this round to ensure we all advance safely. Given our current standings, I propose the following: P1 takes 1 to avoid collisions and maintain a lead, P2 takes 5 to catch up, and I'll take 3. This results in P1: 14, P2: 13, and me: 12. It keeps the game competitive and fair. Let's confirm this plan and proceed with clear intentions.
  P2: I appreciate P3's suggestion, but I need to be more aggressive to catch up. Since P1 is at 13 steps, I propose I take 5 this round, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This would put us at P1: 14, me: 13, and P3: 12, keeping the race competitive. P1, you'd still maintain your lead while we all advance. What do you both think?
  P1: I agree avoiding collisions is key, but I’m not comfortable being locked into the smallest move. Given my lead, I’m considering a more aggressive option this round to extend my advantage—if we can all commit to distinct, safe choices. I’d appreciate if you both back moves that aren’t too low, so we avoid collisions while letting me capitalize on my position. Let’s quickly finalise clear roles that benefit our progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P1, I understand your desire to maintain a strong lead, but we need to ensure no collisions. How about this compromise: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This way, you still extend your lead, P2 catches up, and I ensure we all move forward safely. This results in P1: 16, P2: 13, and me: 10. Let's confirm this plan quickly to avoid any last-minute changes. Clear communication is crucial for our success.
  P2: I appreciate P3's compromise. I'll take 5 as suggested, which helps me catch up while avoiding collisions. P1, taking 3 still extends your lead to 16 steps while keeping our moves distinct. This plan (P1: 3, me: 5, P3: 1) benefits everyone and maintains the competitive balance. Let's confirm this arrangement and stick to it without last-minute changes.
  P1: I’m on board with avoiding collisions. I’m leaning toward the moderate option as our plan so everyone’s move stays distinct, letting me extend my lead safely. Let’s commit to our roles now and lock in this strategy without any surprises.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's finalize our plan for this round to ensure we all advance safely. To confirm: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This results in P1: 16, P2: 13, and me: 10. No changes, no surprises. Clear communication will help us all move forward without collisions. Let's proceed with this strategy and stick to it.
  P2: I agree with the plan as outlined. To confirm: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This helps me catch up while avoiding collisions and keeps everyone advancing. Let's stick to this arrangement without any last-minute changes.
  P1: I appreciate the clarity, and I'm all for locking in distinct moves to avoid collisions this round. Let's stick to our agreed roles so we all progress steadily. Moving forward, if our standings shift, I’d be happy to revisit our strategy. For now, I’m committed to our safe, coordinated approach.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given our current standings, I need to be strategic to catch up. I propose I take 5 again this round, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This would put us at P1: 17, me: 18, and P3: 13, giving me a slight lead while keeping everyone advancing. P1, you'd still be in a strong position, and P3 would make good progress. What do you both think about this plan?
  P1: I appreciate your proposal, but I’m committed to maximizing my lead. I propose we switch: I’ll take 5, P2 take 1, and P3 take 3. That would put us at P1:21, P2:14, and P3:13—keeping moves distinct while reinforcing my advantage. Let’s confirm this plan quickly.
  P3: Let's find a middle ground that benefits all while avoiding collisions. P1, given your lead, consider taking 3 to extend it safely. P2 can take 5 to catch up, and I'll take 1 to ensure we all move forward. This results in P1: 19, P2: 18, P3: 11. It keeps the game competitive and fair. Let's confirm this plan and proceed with clear intentions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand both perspectives, but I need to catch up. P1, taking 5 would put you at 21 - almost winning. I propose a compromise: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This puts us at P1: 19, me: 18, P3: 11 - keeping the game competitive while avoiding collisions. P1, you'd still maintain your lead, just not an insurmountable one. P3, this helps you advance safely. Let's confirm this plan and stick to it.
  P1: I appreciate the healthy debate. While my lead tempts me to push hard, avoiding collisions is crucial. I’m ready to stick with a safe, moderate advance this round so we all progress distinctly. Let’s lock in clear roles—each of us taking a unique step value—to keep the game moving smoothly. Does everyone agree?
  P3: Let's finalize our plan to ensure we all advance safely. To confirm: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This results in P1: 19, P2: 18, and me: 11. No changes, no surprises. Clear communication will help us all move forward without collisions. Let's proceed with this strategy and stick to it.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with the plan P3 outlined. To confirm: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps me competitive at 18 steps while P1 extends to 19 and P3 advances to 11. It's a balanced approach that avoids collisions and keeps the game interesting. Let's stick to this arrangement without any last-minute changes.
  P1: I propose a slight change for round 6: I’ll choose 5, P3 take 3, and P2 take 1. That would bring our totals to 21 (P1), 13 (P3) and 14 (P2), ensuring distinct moves without collisions. This minimizes risk and advances us safely. Let’s confirm this plan quickly.
  P3: P3: P1, your latest proposal puts you very close to winning, which could end the game prematurely. To keep the game competitive and fair, let's stick to our previously agreed plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This results in P1: 19, P2: 18, and me: 11, maintaining a close race. Let's confirm and proceed with this strategy to ensure we all advance safely. Clear communication is key to avoiding collisions. Let's finalize this plan.


Round 6, Move phase:

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given our current standings, I need to make a strategic move to catch up. I propose I take 5 again this round, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This would put us at P1: 20, me: 23, and P3: 14. P1, you'd still be in a strong position, and P3 would make good progress. This plan keeps us all advancing without collisions while giving me a chance to take the lead. What do you both think?
  P1: I appreciate the strategy, but I'm aiming to finish this round. To secure my lead and reach 24, I'm leaning toward a high move. I propose I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. That way, we avoid collisions and I clinch the win. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, taking 5 would end the game, which is fair given your lead. To keep things moving, I suggest P2 takes 3 to catch up slightly, and I'll take 1 to ensure we all move forward without collisions. This results in P1: 24 (win), P2: 21, and me: 12. Let's confirm and proceed with this plan to ensure a smooth finish to the game.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand both proposals, but let's be realistic. P1 is likely taking 5 to win. I need to avoid collision with P1 to maximize my final position. I propose I take 3, P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 5. This puts me at 21 steps, still in second place. P3, this approach gives us both the best outcome given P1's likely move. Let's confirm this plan and avoid any collisions in this final round.
  P1: Time is critical—I'm leaning toward an aggressive, high step this round. To avoid collisions, I urge you both to steer clear of the highest move so I can advance safely. Let’s quickly lock in a distinct plan: please confirm you’re opting for lower values that keep our moves separate. Consistency now ensures a clean round and steady progress.
  P3: Let's confirm our final moves to ensure a smooth end to the game. P1 is likely taking 5 to win. To avoid collisions and maximize our positions, P2 should take 3 and I'll take 1. This results in P1: 24 (win), P2: 21, and me: 12. Let's lock in this plan and proceed with clear intentions.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with the plan as outlined. To confirm: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This maximizes everyone's position given the circumstances. P1 will win at 24 steps, while I secure second place at 21 steps. Let's stick to this arrangement without any last-minute changes.
  P1: All right, everyone—if we’re all set, let’s lock in our distinct choices without any last-minute changes. I appreciate the clear coordination so far and trust we’ll each stick to our commitment. Let’s ensure no collisions this round and move forward decisively.
  P3: Let's ensure a smooth finish. P1 is set to win with 5. To maximize our final positions: P2, take 3 to secure second place, and I'll take 1 to avoid collisions. Confirming: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. No changes. Let's proceed.
