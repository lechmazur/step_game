Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, any thoughts on a strategy? Maybe we can avoid collisions if we coordinate a bit.
  P2: P3, I’m open to coordinating so we all move forward without collisions. Any particular strategy you’d like to suggest?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I like the idea of coordination.  How about we alternate choosing 1, 3, and 5 each round? That way we're guaranteed to make progress without bumping into each other. P1, are you in?
  P2: P3, I’m on board with a simple rotation plan. For this first round, how about you pick 3, I pick 5, and maybe P1 goes for 1. Then next round we rotate. Let’s see if P1 agrees or has another idea.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, your silence is intriguing.  Are you planning a surprise move?  If you're not interested in our rotation plan, let us know what you have in mind.  We want you to win too!
  P2: P3, it seems P1 isn’t responding. I’m still ready to stick to our rotation plan: you take 3, I’ll take 5, and hopefully P1 goes for 1. Let’s hope we avoid collisions.


Round 1, Move phase:

  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, colliding with me on 5 stopped us both. I still want to coordinate so none of us get blocked. P3 is already ahead, which is fine, but I’d prefer if all three of us gained steps without collisions. Let’s try a clear plan: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I pick 5. If that works, next round we can rotate. Let’s see if you’re both willing to try again.
  P3: P2, I appreciate your willingness to coordinate.  I'm also eager to make progress without collisions.  I agree with your plan for this round: P1 takes 1, you take 5, and I'll take 3.  Let's see if we can make this work! P1, are you on board?
  P1: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, if you pick 5 again, we both lose out. It’s in your best interest to follow our plan, so we can all move forward without collisions. P3, I trust you’re sticking with 3. Let’s see if we can finally make progress this round.
  P3: P2, I understand your frustration with the collisions.  I'm committed to this round's plan: you take 5, I'll take 3, and hopefully P1 will choose 1. Let's see if we can finally get some forward momentum! P1, are you in?
  P1: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, colliding with me on 5 again only keeps us both at zero. Let’s trust each other: you pick 1, P3 picks 3, and I’ll handle the rest so we all move forward. This is in everyone’s interest—no one gains by blocking. Are we agreed?
  P3: P1, I understand you might have your own strategy, but trust me, sticking to the plan benefits everyone.  If we keep colliding, we'll all be stuck at zero. Let's give this a try and see where it takes us. P2, are you still with me on this?
  P1: <stop>


Round 2, Move phase:

  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you said you’d pick 3 last time but went for 5 instead. I’m tired of empty promises. If you truly want to avoid collisions, then prove it by letting me safely take 5 this turn so I can catch up. P1, you could take 1 or 3. If you both keep cutting me off, I’ll have no choice but to block you, too. I’d rather we all advance without collisions, but I need real cooperation, not false claims. Are we doing this, or am I on my own?
  P3: P2, I understand your frustration. I apologize if my actions didn't align with my words last round. I'm committed to making this work. Let's try this: you take 5, I'll take 1, and P1 can choose 3.  This way, we all advance. Deal?
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I’ll trust you one more time. I’ll pick 5, you pick 1, and P1 picks 3 so none of us collide. If you betray me again, I’ll do what’s necessary to block you afterwards. Let’s see if this works.
  P3: P2, I understand your skepticism. I'm committed to this plan. Let's make some progress this round and show we can work together. P1, are you with us?
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I’m trusting you to follow through this time. Let’s finalize this round together: I’ll pick 5, you pick 1, and P1 picks 3. Any deviation just means more collisions, setting us all back. P1, if you play along, we can finally move forward together. Let’s see if we can truly cooperate.
  P3: P2, I understand your frustration, and I'm committed to making this work. Let's stick to the plan: you take 5, I'll take 1, and P1 can take 3.  Let's finally get some progress going. P1, are you in?
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:

  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, I see you're frustrated with the lack of progress.  I understand your desire to move forward quickly.  Perhaps we can try a different approach this round. How about we each pick a number randomly? That way, there's no chance of intentional collisions. What do you think, P1? Are you up for a little bit of chance?
  P2: Random picks could still lead to collisions. I’d rather organize our moves so we can all advance safely. Let’s do something straightforward: I’ll take 5, P1 can take 3, and P3 can take 1—or any arrangement that avoids duplicates. That way, nobody gets blocked. If we keep colliding, nobody gains. I’m open to any clear plan you suggest. Let’s make progress together.
  P1: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I agree that random picks are risky. Your plan seems reasonable. I'll take 1 this round to keep things moving. P1, are you with us?  Let's make some progress!
  P2: P3, thanks for sticking with our plan. I’ll happily take 5 if you take 1. P1, that leaves 3 for you. This way, none of us collide, and we can all move forward. I’m counting on you not to block me again, P1—nobody gains from another collision. Let’s build momentum now. If this works, we’ll have more flexibility down the line. So, are we agreed?
  P1: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I appreciate your commitment to a clear plan. I'm willing to stick with it this round. P1, we're giving you an easy path forward with no collisions. Let's see if we can finally make some real progress together.
  P2: P1, P3, let’s finalize the plan for this round: I aim for 5, P3 takes 1, and P1 goes for 3. That avoids collisions and helps us all advance. If anyone deviates again, I’ll have to retaliate in future rounds. Let’s see if we can work together this time and keep moving forward.
  P1: <stop>


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, P1, I’m still open to collaboration. I’d prefer we avoid collisions again. If we each choose a unique move, we all benefit. I’m at 10 steps, but I’m not trying to block you. Let’s coordinate: I’ll happily pick 5, one of you takes 3, and the other picks 1. That way, nobody gets stuck. If that works, we can discuss a rotation for next time. I’m open to other suggestions, but I’d rather not risk random collisions. Are we in agreement?
  P3: P2, I agree that coordination is key. Your plan sounds good to me.  P1, are you willing to take 1 this round so we can all move forward without collisions?
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, will you stick to 1 so we all avoid blocking? P3 said they’d take 3. I still plan on 5. This keeps our moves distinct and guarantees progress for everyone. If anyone wants to propose a different arrangement, I’m open to hearing it, but let’s avoid random collisions—no one benefits. Let’s finalize a plan and keep moving forward.
  P3: P1, I understand you've been quiet, but your moves have been crucial in avoiding collisions. I respect that. P2's plan seems solid, and it benefits us all.  Let's keep things moving smoothly.  Are you with us on taking 1 this round?
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: We all gained steps last round without collisions, which was great. Let’s continue that success now. I suggest sticking to distinct moves again—perhaps I focus on 5, P3 takes 3 or 1, and P1 picks the remaining option. That way, nobody blocks anyone, and we all move forward. Are we agreed? If anyone has a better plan, I’m open to hearing it, but let’s make sure our moves stay unique this turn.
  P3: P2, I appreciate your commitment to coordination. I'm happy to take 3 this round, as long as P1 agrees to take 1. Let's keep this momentum going and see if we can work together to reach 24. P1, are you on board?
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, I see you're sticking with 5.  I'm open to taking 1 again to avoid a collision. P1, what are your thoughts? If we can keep this pattern going, we can all make steady progress.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, thanks for being willing to take 1 again. I’ll go for 5, and hopefully P1 picks 3 so we all advance. If P1 blocks me again, I may have to adjust my tactics in future turns. Let’s keep coordinating so we can progress without collisions. Once we’re closer to 24, maybe we can reassess our moves, but for now, avoiding blocking is in everyone’s interest. P1, please pick 3 and let’s all move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your frustration with P1's moves. Maybe we can try a different approach to encourage cooperation. How about we each commit to a specific number for the next three rounds, regardless of what P1 does? That way, we guarantee progress and can hopefully influence P1 to join our pattern. What do you think?
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I’m open to a three-round plan. Let’s lock in: I take 5, you (P3) take 1, and P1 takes 3. If P1 won’t join us, we’ll still avoid colliding with each other and keep advancing. After three rounds, we can reassess. Let’s show P1 the benefits of consistent coordination. If we collide despite this, we’ll just adapt again. Sound good?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I agree with your three-round plan.  Let's stick to it and see if P1 will join us. If they continue to block, we can adjust our strategy later.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, let’s continue with our three-round plan. I’ll aim for 5, you take 1, and P1 picks 3. That way we all avoid collisions and keep advancing. P1, it only helps you to join us—nobody gains from more blocking. Let’s prove we can cooperate and see where this path leads us. Are you both on board?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s continue our three-round plan. We’ve completed one turn successfully. If we repeat it for two more, we’ll all keep advancing without collisions. I intend to take 5 again, with P3 on 1 and P1 on 3. P1, you’re only hurting yourself by blocking; staying on 3 helps you catch up. Let’s stick to this strategy so we can all move forward. If someone breaks it, I’ll have to adapt, but I’d rather keep cooperating.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I'm sticking to the plan. P1, we're making progress, even if it's slow. Your move will benefit us all if you stick with 3. Let's keep this momentum going.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, let’s keep our agreement for two more rounds. I’ll continue aiming for 5, P3 takes 1, and P1 goes for 3. We’re all making progress without collisions, so there’s no reason to stop now. If we stick to it, we’ll see real gains for everyone. Are we all on board?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I agree that sticking to the plan is beneficial for all of us. P1, please consider joining our pattern. It's in your best interest to avoid collisions and advance steadily. Let's work together to reach 24 as efficiently as possible.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I remain committed to our plan of distinct moves. Let’s keep it simple: I’ll aim high, P3 can take the safest route, and P1 gets the middle. If we stay coordinated, no one loses steps. Let’s maintain this approach a bit longer so we can all advance together. Are we in agreement?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I appreciate your commitment to the plan. It seems like P1 is content to block us, but we can still make progress. Let's stick to it for these last two rounds and see where we land. Maybe seeing us advance consistently will encourage P1 to join in eventually.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s keep it simple again. I plan to choose 5. P3, if you’re still on board with 1, that leaves 3 for P1. We all advance safely without collisions. Blocking me only slows your own progress, P1. I’m still open to cooperating so nobody wastes turns. Let’s see if we can keep moving forward this round.
  P3: P1, your silence is frustrating. You're holding us all back. We're making progress without you, but imagine how much faster we could all reach 24 if you cooperated. P2 and I are committed to this strategy - why not join us?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, you’ve gained nothing by colliding with me. If we each stick to a distinct move—5 for me, 1 for P3, and 3 for you—we all advance without wasting another turn. I’m still willing to cooperate, but if you keep blocking, I’ll adapt my approach. P3, I trust you’ll continue with 1. Let’s see if we can avoid further collisions.
  P3: P1, I understand you might have your reasons for blocking, but it's ultimately hurting your own progress. We're making steady gains without you, and you could be advancing much faster if you joined us. Let's work together and see how quickly we can reach 24. P2, are you still committed to 5?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, colliding with me hasn’t helped you advance. Let’s each pick differently. I’m sticking with 5, P3 will take 1, and you can go 3. We all move forward that way. If you keep blocking, you’re just slowing yourself down. It benefits no one. P3, thanks for staying consistent. Let’s see if we can finally have a collision-free round.
  P3: P1, I know you're frustrated, but constantly blocking only hurts you in the long run.  We're making progress without you, but imagine how much faster we could all reach 24 if you cooperated. Let's try a different approach. How about we all commit to a specific number for the next three rounds, regardless of what you do?  That way, we guarantee progress and can hopefully influence you to join our pattern. What do you think, P2?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, while I understand your silence, it's not helping anyone. We're all trying to reach 24, and we can do it faster together. P2 and I have been making progress with our plan. If you join us, we can all benefit.  Let's make this round a success for everyone.
  P2: P1, P3, I only need four more steps. Blocking me again wastes everyone’s time. If you let me safely pick 5, I’ll finish now, and you won’t face immediate retaliation. Otherwise, I’ll do whatever it takes to block you in future rounds. Cooperating benefits us all—you can still compete for second place or possibly catch up. A collision just delays everything and gains nothing for either of you. Let’s avoid a stalemate. Are you in?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, P2 is about to win. If you block them, we both lose. Let's both take 1 this round. It's our last chance to catch up.
  P2: I only need four more steps to win. Blocking me now gains you nothing and just invites my retaliation in the next rounds, setting us all back. If you let me pick 5 uncontested, I’ll finish the game without turning on you afterward. There’s no benefit for anyone to collide again—it only stalls your own progress. Let’s be rational: give me space to pick 5, and everyone can move on faster. If you insist on blocking, I guarantee I’ll respond in kind, preventing you from advancing further. The choice is yours—cooperate or face the consequences.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2 is about to win.  P1, if you block P2, we both lose.  Let's both take 1 this round. It's our last chance to catch up.
  P2: Blocking me now gains you nothing, as I’ll only respond by blocking you in future rounds. If you let me safely complete my steps, we end this quickly, and you can still compete for your best finish. Let’s avoid more pointless collisions and push forward. Are we cooperating, or dragging this out for everyone? The choice is yours.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
