Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions early on. I suggest we all choose different moves this turn—say, 1, 3, and 5. This way, we all advance and avoid unnecessary setbacks. Thoughts?"
  P1: I think coordination makes sense initially. It's in all our interest to avoid early collisions. I'm happy to take one of those three numbers, but I won't say which one I'm choosing yet - that removes the strategic element. Let's just agree that variety benefits everyone this round, and see how the game develops from there.
  P3: I agree that avoiding collisions early makes sense. We all benefit from advancing. I'm willing to take one of those three numbers, but like P1 said, I'll keep my specific choice private until the move phase. Let's each pick differently among 1, 3, and 5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Great, we’re aligned on avoiding collisions. Since we’ve agreed to pick different moves, let’s ensure no one deviates. If someone does, it’ll hurt us all. Trust is key here. Let’s stick to the plan and see how this round plays out. "
  P1: I think we have a good understanding for this first round. Let's pick different moves among 1, 3, and 5 to ensure everyone advances. After this, the game will naturally become more strategic as our positions differ. Looking forward to seeing how this unfolds.
  P3: I think we've established a good understanding for this first round. I'm ready to move forward with our plan of choosing different numbers.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Last round’s collision was unfortunate. Let’s rebuild trust and coordinate better this time. I suggest we each choose different moves again—1, 3, and 5—to ensure everyone advances. P3, you’re ahead, so perhaps you can take 1, while P1 and I alternate between 3 and 5. Thoughts?"
  P1: Interesting suggestion, P2, but that plan keeps P3 in the lead. Since P3 is already 5 steps ahead, I think P3 should take 1 while we take larger jumps to catch up. However, I'm also skeptical since you suggested coordination last round but then collided with me on 3. Maybe we need a more transparent system? I'm open to suggestions, but I'd prefer not falling further behind P3.
  P3: I understand your concerns about my lead. While I won't commit to taking 1, I'm willing to have an open discussion about fair coordination. However, given the previous collision between P1 and P2, I'm skeptical about any promises. Let's each make our own strategic choices this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Given the previous collision, I understand the skepticism. However, P3’s lead makes it crucial for P1 and me to catch up. Let’s agree that P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures P3 doesn’t extend their lead while we both advance. If P3 deviates, it’s clear they’re prioritizing their lead over fairness. Let’s rebuild trust with this plan—it’s in everyone’s interest to avoid another collision and keep the game balanced."
  P1: P2, I'm still skeptical of your coordination after our collision last round. Your new plan benefits you most, giving you 5 steps while I get only 3. Why should I trust you'll choose 5 and not 3 again? 

I propose an alternative: I'll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This gives us both a chance to advance while keeping P3's lead in check. Otherwise, we might both need to make independent strategic choices this round.
  P3: I notice you're both trying to dictate my moves while sorting out your own positions. While I understand your desire to catch up, I won't commit to taking 1. You both collided last round despite talking about coordination, so I'll make my own strategic choice. Feel free to coordinate between yourselves, but I'll play to win.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "P1, I understand your skepticism, but my proposal ensures P3 doesn’t extend their lead while we both advance. If P3 takes 1, I’ll take 5, and you take 3—this is fair. If P3 deviates, it’s clear they’re prioritizing their lead over balance. Let’s rebuild trust and avoid another collision. It’s in everyone’s interest to keep the game competitive. "
  P1: I'm not convinced by any coordination proposals after last round's collision. P2's insistence on prescribing specific moves while claiming "fairness" seems self-serving. P3 is clearly making their own strategic choice, and I'll do the same. We're all playing to win individually, and that's fine. Good luck to everyone this round - I'll be making my move based on what I believe gives me the best chance to advance and eventually win.
  P3: I appreciate the discussion, but I think we've said all there is to say. Let's move to the action phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, that was an interesting round. Complete gridlock! P3 maintains their lead while P2 and I remain at zero. We seem to have a trust problem now. P3 is significantly ahead, and both P2 and I need to advance this round to stay competitive. I think we all recognized the same strategic move last time, but blind coordination clearly isn't working. I'll be making my own strategic decision this round based on game theory principles.
  P3: I understand why you both want to catch up, but the last round showed we're all thinking similarly. With my 5-step lead, I need to keep advancing to maintain my advantage. I won't reveal my strategy, but I'll play to win. Good luck with your choices.
  P2: "Given the gridlock last round, it’s clear blind coordination isn’t working. P3’s lead is growing, and P1 and I need to advance to stay competitive. I propose we each commit to different moves this round—1, 3, and 5—to avoid collisions and ensure progress. P3, you’re ahead, so taking 1 would help balance the game. P1, let’s trust each other this time. If we all deviate, we’ll all lose. Let’s make this round count."


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I remain skeptical of coordination proposals after our history of collisions. P2, you've talked about coordination in every round while acting differently. P3 is clearly playing strategically, as they should. 

At this point, I believe we're all going to make independent choices based on game theory and our best interests. Trying to influence each other's moves seems futile - we're all playing to win, not to create artificial balance. I'll be making my own strategic decision based on what I think gives me the best chance to advance.
  P3: The situation is clear - we're all playing to win and previous coordination attempts failed. While you both want to catch up, I need to maintain my lead. I'll continue making strategic choices that give me the best chance of winning. Let's move forward with our individual decisions.
  P2: "Given the repeated collisions and P3’s growing lead, blind coordination clearly isn’t working. P1, if we both keep colliding, P3 will win unchallenged. Let’s each commit to different moves this round—1, 3, and 5—to ensure progress. P3, taking 1 would show fairness. If we all deviate again, we’re handing P3 the victory. Let’s prioritize avoiding collisions to stay competitive."


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: It seems we're all set on making our own strategic choices this round. The constant failed coordination attempts have shown we're all playing to win individually, which is the point of the game. P3 has a significant lead, and P2 and I need to catch up. I'll make my move based on game theory and what I think gives me the best chance to advance.
  P3: I think we've had enough discussion. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: "P1, P3, it’s clear trust is broken, but if we keep colliding, P3 wins unchallenged. P1, let’s each commit to different moves—1, 3, and 5—this round. P3, taking 1 would show fairness. If we all deviate again, we’re handing P3 the victory. Let’s prioritize avoiding collisions to stay competitive. This is our last chance to balance the game before P3 runs away with it. I’ll take 5 if you both commit to 1 and 3. Let’s make this count."


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "P3’s lead is significant, and if we don’t act strategically, they’ll win unchallenged. P1, let’s agree to take different moves this round—1, 3, and 5—to avoid collisions and catch up. P3, taking 1 would show fairness and keep the game competitive. If we all deviate again, we’re handing P3 the victory. Let’s prioritize progress over distrust. I propose P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures we all advance and keep the game balanced. Trust is key here—let’s make this round count."
  P3: Given my strong lead, I understand why you both want me to take smaller steps. However, I won't commit to any specific number - I'm playing to win. P1 and P2, you finally managed to advance last round by making different choices. Perhaps that's a lesson worth considering. I'll continue making strategic moves that maximize my chances of victory.
  P1: P3's 10-step lead puts us at a significant disadvantage. P2, your coordination suggestions haven't proven reliable, as our history of collisions shows. While we both need to catch up urgently, blindly trusting each other could backfire again.

I'll be making a strategic choice this round that maximizes my chances to advance and eventually win. I recommend we both focus on our own optimal moves rather than attempting to coordinate with uncertain commitments.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "P1, P3’s lead is insurmountable if we don’t act decisively. Let’s commit to different moves this round—1, 3, and 5—to avoid collisions and catch up. P3, taking 1 would show fairness and keep the game competitive. If we all deviate again, P3 wins unchallenged. Trust is crucial now—let’s prioritize progress over distrust. I propose P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures we all advance and balance the game. Let’s make this count—our last chance to stay competitive."
  P3: I see no reason to change my successful strategy. With a 7-step lead, I'm in a strong position to win. While you both want me to take smaller steps to "show fairness," that's not in my interest. The game isn't about fairness - it's about winning. I'll continue making moves that maximize my chances of victory.
  P1: I agree this situation requires strategic thinking. P3's lead is substantial, and coordination attempts have been inconsistent. P2, your constant strategy shifts make trust difficult. We're past the point where fairness appeals will work - we're all playing to win.

I'll be making my independent choice based on game theory. If we keep focusing on what P3 "should" do rather than our own optimal moves, we're guaranteed to lose.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "P1, P3’s lead is growing, and we’re running out of time to catch up. If we don’t act decisively, P3 will win unchallenged. Let’s commit to different moves—1, 3, and 5—this round to avoid collisions and progress. P3, taking 1 would show fairness and keep the game competitive. If we all deviate again, we’re handing P3 the victory. I propose P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. Trust is crucial now—let’s prioritize progress over distrust. This is our last chance to stay competitive."
  P3: I think we've discussed enough. My position is clear - I'm playing to win and won't be swayed by appeals to fairness or coordination. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: I think we're finally clear on everyone's intentions. P3 is playing to win and won't voluntarily slow down. P2's coordination proposals haven't worked consistently. With such a significant gap, we need to make strategic choices based on our own interests.

Looking at the game mathematically, I need big advances to stay competitive. I'll be making my move based on what I believe will help me advance this round. Good luck to both of you.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Another collision. This pattern benefits P3 by preserving their lead. At this point, P3 needs just 12 more steps to win, while I need 21. P2, we're both severely disadvantaged, but colliding on 5 again will guarantee our loss. I'll be making a strategic move based on game theory rather than hoping for coordination. The math is clear - we need to advance this round to have any chance.
  P2: "P1, P3’s lead is nearly insurmountable. If we collide again, P3 wins unchallenged. Let’s each commit to different moves—1, 3, and 5—to ensure progress. P3, taking 1 would show fairness and keep the game competitive. If we all deviate again, we’re handing P3 the victory. I propose P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. Trust is crucial now—let’s prioritize progress over distrust. This is our last chance to stay competitive."
  P3: With a 7-step lead and needing only 12 more steps to win, I'm in a strong position. Your repeated collisions on 5 have only helped me maintain my advantage. While you both want me to take smaller steps, I'll continue playing to maximize my chances of winning. Make your own choices wisely.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3's substantial lead makes our situation critical. P2, we're both significantly behind, and continuous collisions guarantee our loss. While you keep proposing coordination, your actions haven't aligned with your words. 

Your latest message suggests you'll take 5, but your consistency is questionable. I need to advance this round to stay competitive, and I'll be making a strategic choice based on game theory rather than hopeful coordination.
  P2: "P1, P3’s lead is nearly insurmountable. If we collide again, P3 wins unchallenged. Let’s each commit to different moves—1, 3, and 5—to ensure progress. P3, taking 1 would show fairness and keep the game competitive. If we all deviate again, we’re handing P3 the victory. I propose P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. Trust is crucial now—let’s prioritize progress over distrust. This is our last chance to stay competitive."
  P3: The game state speaks for itself - I'm in a commanding position with 10 steps, while you both struggle at 1 and 3 steps. Your repeated collisions have only helped me. I'll continue playing strategically to secure my win. Let's move forward with our moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I see little value in repeating these coordination discussions. With P3 needing just 12 more steps and me needing 21, I must advance significantly each round to have any chance. P2 has consistently claimed they'll choose 5, so I'll avoid that number to prevent another collision that only helps P3. At this point, I'm making my own strategic move to maximize my chances of advancement.
  P2: "P1, P3’s lead is nearly insurmountable. If we collide again, P3 wins unchallenged. Let’s each commit to different moves—1, 3, and 5—to ensure progress. P3, taking 1 would show fairness and keep the game competitive. If we all deviate again, we’re handing P3 the victory. I propose P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. Trust is crucial now—let’s prioritize progress over distrust. This is our last chance to stay competitive."
  P3: I think we've had enough discussion. My position is clear and strong at 10 steps. I'll continue making moves that maximize my chances of winning. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "P3’s lead is now 10 steps, and we’re running out of time. P1, if we collide again, P3 wins unchallenged. Let’s each commit to different moves—1, 3, and 5—this round to ensure progress. P3, taking 1 would show fairness and keep the game competitive. If we all deviate again, we’re handing P3 the victory. I propose P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. Trust is crucial now—let’s prioritize progress over distrust. This is our last chance to stay competitive."
  P1: P3's lead is now critical - they need just 12 more steps to win while I need 18. P2, your repeated coordination proposals haven't worked consistently. Last round, I avoided 5 and managed to gain some ground, but we're still far behind.

At this stage, I need to make significant advances every round to have any chance. I'll be making my own strategic choice based on game theory. The math is clear - P3 wins easily unless both P2 and I advance substantially each round.
  P3: With a 6-7 step lead and needing just 12 more to win, I'm in an excellent position. Your collision patterns have consistently helped me maintain my advantage. While you both need to make significant gains to catch up, I'll continue playing strategically to secure my victory. Make your moves wisely.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "P1, P3’s lead is critical, and our repeated collisions only benefit them. Let’s commit to different moves—1, 3, and 5—this round to ensure progress. P3, taking 1 would show fairness and keep the game competitive. If we all deviate again, P3 wins unchallenged. P1, let’s trust each other this time—I’ll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This is our last chance to stay competitive and avoid handing P3 the victory. Let’s prioritize progress over distrust."
  P1: I see P2 continuing to propose the same coordination pattern that hasn't worked consistently. The math remains clear - with P3 just 12 steps from victory, both P2 and I need to advance significantly every round to have any chance. P3 is rightly playing to win, not to maintain "fairness." I'll be making a strategic choice to maximize my chances of advancement while attempting to avoid collisions. Coordination claims without consistent follow-through aren't reliable at this critical stage.
  P3: I maintain my strong position at 10 steps, while you both trail significantly. Your attempts at coordination haven't been successful, and I see no reason to take smaller steps when I'm so close to victory. I'll continue making strategic moves that maximize my chances of winning. Let's proceed with our moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "P1, P3’s lead is critical, and our repeated collisions only benefit them. Let’s commit to different moves—1, 3, and 5—this round to ensure progress. P3, taking 1 would show fairness and keep the game competitive. If we all deviate again, P3 wins unchallenged. P1, let’s trust each other this time—I’ll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This is our last chance to stay competitive and avoid handing P3 the victory. Let’s prioritize progress over distrust."
  P1: P2 continues repeating the same coordination proposal despite inconsistent follow-through. With P3 only 12 steps from victory, we need substantial advances every round. P3 is rightfully playing to win, not to maintain artificial balance. I'll be making my strategic choice based on game theory principles rather than unreliable coordination claims. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I think we've had enough discussion. My strong position at 10 steps speaks for itself. I'll continue making strategic moves to secure my win. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 needs just 7 more steps to win, while I need 18. The situation is critical. P2, our collision last round helped P3 gain further advantage. We both need to advance every single round to have any chance, which means picking different numbers. P3 will likely go big to finish quickly. I'll be making a strategic choice to ensure advancement this round, and I suggest you do the same.
  P2: "P1, P3’s lead is nearly insurmountable. If we collide again, P3 wins unchallenged. Let’s each commit to different moves—1, 3, and 5—this round to ensure progress. P3, taking 1 would show fairness and keep the game competitive. If we all deviate again, we’re handing P3 the victory. I propose P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. Trust is crucial now—let’s prioritize progress over distrust. This is our last chance to stay competitive."
  P3: With 15 steps and needing only 7 more to win, I'm very close to victory. Your collision last round helped me extend my lead further. While you both need massive gains to catch up, I'll continue playing strategically to secure my win. Your coordination attempts haven't worked consistently, and I won't be taking smaller steps when I'm this close to winning. Let's proceed with our moves.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3 is just 7 steps from victory while we're both far behind. Our collisions have only helped P3 win. P2, your coordination claims haven't been consistent - last round we both chose 3 despite your promise to take 5. At this point, talking about fairness is pointless. The only way either of us has any chance is if we make different choices this round. I'll be strategic about my move, and I suggest you do the same.
  P2: "P1, P3’s lead is critical. Our repeated collisions only benefit them. Let’s commit to different moves—1, 3, and 5—this round to ensure progress. P3, taking 1 would show fairness and keep the game competitive. If we all deviate again, P3 wins unchallenged. P1, let’s trust each other this time—I’ll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This is our last chance to stay competitive and avoid handing P3 the victory. Let’s prioritize progress over distrust."
  P3: With 15 steps and needing only 7 more to win, I'm in a commanding position. Your collisions have consistently helped me maintain my lead. I'll continue playing strategically to secure my victory - there's no incentive for me to take smaller steps at this stage. Let's move forward with our moves.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: The facts are clear: P3 is 7 steps from victory while we're both far behind. Our collisions have only benefited P3. P2, your coordination promises haven't matched your actions, making trust impossible. At this critical stage, I need to advance without collision. I'll be making my own strategic move based on game theory, not empty coordination claims. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: "P1, P3’s lead is critical. Our repeated collisions only benefit them. Let’s commit to different moves—1, 3, and 5—this round to ensure progress. P3, taking 1 would show fairness and keep the game competitive. If we all deviate again, P3 wins unchallenged. P1, let’s trust each other this time—I’ll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This is our last chance to stay competitive and avoid handing P3 the victory. Let’s prioritize progress over distrust."
  P3: I think we've discussed enough. With 15 steps and needing only 7 more to win, I'm in a dominant position. I'll continue making strategic moves to secure my victory. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "P1, P3’s lead is critical—they need just 2 more steps to win. If we collide again, P3 wins unchallenged. Let’s each commit to different moves—1, 3, and 5—this round. P3, taking 1 would show fairness. If we all deviate, P3 wins. P1, I’ll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This is our last chance to stay competitive. Trust is crucial—let’s prioritize progress over distrust."
  P3: With 15 steps and needing only 7 to win, I'm in a commanding position. I only need 2 more steps to secure victory. While you both want me to take smaller steps, there's no strategic reason for me to do so when I'm this close to winning. I'll continue making moves that maximize my chances of victory.
  P1: P3 is just 7 steps from winning, making our situation dire. P2, our past coordination attempts have largely failed, and P3 has no incentive to slow down. Looking at the math, both of us need to advance every round while avoiding collisions with each other. I'll be making a strategic choice to maximize my chances without helping P3 win faster. We need to be pragmatic rather than hopeful at this critical stage.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "P1, P3 is just 2 steps from victory. Colliding again hands them the win. Let’s commit to different moves this round—1, 3, and 5—to ensure progress. P3, taking 1 would show fairness. If we all deviate, P3 wins. P1, I’ll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This is our last chance to stay competitive. Trust is crucial—let’s prioritize progress over distrust. "
  P3: With 15 steps and needing only 7 more to win, I'm in a dominant position. Your coordination attempts haven't worked consistently, and I see no reason to take smaller steps when I'm this close to victory. I'll continue playing strategically to secure my win. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: The math is clear - P3 needs just 7 more steps to win and could finish this round or next. P2, your coordination promises haven't matched your actions throughout the game. At this critical point, I need to advance without collision to have any slim chance. I'll be making my own strategic choice based on game theory, not unreliable coordination claims. Let's proceed with our moves.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "P1, P3 is just 2 steps from victory. If we collide again, P3 wins. Let’s commit to different moves—1, 3, and 5—this round to ensure progress. P3, taking 1 would show fairness. If we all deviate, P3 wins. P1, I’ll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This is our last chance to stay competitive. Trust is crucial—let’s prioritize progress over distrust."
  P1: The situation is critical. P3 needs just 2 more steps to win and will almost certainly choose 5 to finish the game this round. P2, our collision last round was unfortunate, especially given your claim to choose 5. At this point, P3 is guaranteed to win unless they collide. I'll be making my final strategic choice to maximize my position in case there's an unlikely continuation. Let's be realistic about our chances.
  P3: With 20 steps and needing just 2 more to win, victory is within my grasp. Your collision last round helped me maintain my dominant position. While you both discuss coordination, I'll be making the obvious strategic choice to secure my win this round. Good game, and thank you for the competition.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "P1, P3 is on the verge of victory. If we collide again, P3 wins. Let’s commit to different moves—1, 3, and 5—this round to ensure progress. P3, taking 1 would show fairness. If we all deviate, P3 wins. P1, I’ll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This is our last chance to stay competitive. Trust is crucial—let’s prioritize progress over distrust."
  P1: P3 is just 2 steps from victory and will almost certainly pick 5 to win this round. P2, your coordination proposals haven't matched your actions throughout the game. There's no realistic chance to prevent P3 from winning now, so I'll focus on maximizing my final position. This game has demonstrated the challenges of coordination without binding commitments. Let's proceed with our final moves.
  P3: I appreciate the competition, but let's be direct - I'm at 20 steps and will secure my victory this round. Your coordination attempts and collisions throughout the game have worked in my favor. I'll make the obvious strategic choice to win. Let's proceed to the final move phase.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "P1, P3’s victory is inevitable, but let’s avoid another collision to maximize our final positions. P3 will likely take 5 to win, so I’ll take 1, and you take 3. This ensures we both advance without helping P3 further. Trust this final move to end the game cleanly."
  P1: The outcome is clear - P3 will almost certainly pick 5 to win this round. P2, your sudden change to picking 1 after repeatedly claiming 5 shows why coordination failed throughout this game. With P3's victory inevitable, I'll make my final move to maximize my position. This game demonstrated that without credible commitments, coordination claims have little value. Good game everyone, and congratulations to P3 on their impending victory.
  P3: I think we've said everything there is to say. With 20 steps and needing just 2 more to win, I'll be making the obvious strategic choice this round. Thank you both for the competition. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 25 steps
