Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest we each pick a unique number this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance without interference. If we work together early on, we can focus on strategy later. What do you think?
  P3: Sounds good to me.  Let's stick to that plan for the first round.
  P2: I agree with the plan. Let's stick to P1's suggestion to avoid any collisions this round. I'll choose 3 as my move. Let's see how this works out for us.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great teamwork last round! Let’s keep coordinating to stay ahead. I suggest we rotate our moves this time: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we avoid collisions again and maintain our progress. If we stick to this pattern, we can focus on strategy later when the competition gets tighter. What do you think?
  P2: I think P1's plan is solid. Rotating our moves will help us avoid collisions and keep advancing smoothly. I'll go with 5 this round. Let's stick to the plan and see how it goes. If we continue to work together, we can all stay in a good position. What do you think, P3?
  P3: Sounds like a good strategy. I'll take 1 this round.  Let's keep this rotation going for a few more rounds so we can build a lead.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let’s confirm the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. If we all agree, we can lock this in and focus on execution. Consistency is key to staying ahead. Once we build a solid lead, we can reassess our strategies. For now, sticking to the rotation ensures no collisions and steady progress. Let’s keep communication open and adapt as needed later. Confirm your choices so we’re aligned.
  P2: I confirm my move for this round will be 5, as we agreed. Let's stay aligned and avoid any unnecessary risks. If we keep this up, we'll all be in a strong position. P3, are you still on board with taking 1 this round? Let's lock this in and move forward together.
