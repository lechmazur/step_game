Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions. I’ll take <move>1</move> this turn. If you both choose 3 and 5 respectively, we all advance. This way, we can progress safely and plan future moves. What do you think?
  P2: Okay P1, that sounds like a reasonable starting point. I'm willing to cooperate for now. I'll go with <move>3</move> this round if you're taking <move>1</move>. P3, that leaves <move>5</move> for you, assuming you're on board. Let's see if this works.
  P3: I'm fine with taking <move>5</move> for this first round. It makes sense to avoid collisions so we all advance. Just know that I won't always take the largest step - we should rotate who gets which number in future rounds to keep things fair. Let's start with this arrangement and see how it goes.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Confirmed, let’s stick with 1, 3, 5 this turn to ensure progress. For future rounds, I agree rotation is key—perhaps we can cycle turns where each of us takes the larger steps in order. But today, let’s focus on advancing safely. I’ll take 1 as planned.
  P2: Sounds good. I'm sticking with <move>3</move> for this round. P3, you're still good with <move>5</move>?
  P3: Yes, I'm still good with <move>5</move> for this round. I appreciate us starting with coordination rather than chaos. For future rounds, I support rotating who gets the larger steps to keep things fair. Let's finish this conversation and make our moves.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, last round went smoothly. This round, I'm thinking I'll aim for <move>5</move>. P1, maybe you could take <move>1</move> again, and P3, you could go for <move>3</move>? That way we all advance again. What do you both think?
  P3: I appreciate the suggestion, P2, but let's rotate fairly. Since I took 5 last time, I should take 1 this round. P1 could take 3, and you could take 5. This keeps with our rotation principle. That way we all advance, and everyone gets turns with different step sizes. Does that work for everyone?
  P1: P1: I agree with P3's rotation plan to maintain fairness. Let's proceed with P3 taking 1, me taking 3, and P2 taking 5 this round. This ensures progress while allowing everyone equal access to larger steps over time. Next round, I'll aim for 5 to continue the cycle. Cooperation maximizes our collective advancement and minimizes collisions. Let's confirm and move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I understand the rotation plan and agree with it. So, to confirm, I will take <move>5</move> this round, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Let's proceed with that.
  P3: I confirm I'll take <move>1</move> this round. The rotation plan works well for everyone. Next round, P1 will take 5, I'll take 3, and P2 will take 1. This way we all get fair turns with different step sizes. Let's stick to this pattern to avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances steadily.
  P1: P1: Agreed to the rotation plan—this round I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Let’s strictly follow this to avoid collisions. Looking ahead, in Round 3, I’ll take <move>5</move> to close the gap. We must keep rotating fairly to maximize collective progress toward 23. Any objections?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think our rotation plan is working well. According to our agreement, this round should be P1 taking <move>5</move>, me taking <move>3</move>, and P2 taking <move>1</move>. This keeps us all advancing without collisions while maintaining fairness. After this round, we'll be at P1: 9, P2: 9, and me: 9, which keeps the game balanced. Let's continue with this rotation pattern.
  P1: P1: Agreed with P3's rotation plan. This round, I'll take <move>5</move> as planned, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. Let’s strictly adhere to this to maintain balance. After this, I’ll rotate back to smaller steps to avoid future collisions. Consistency in our agreed rotation is key to all advancing safely. Any objections?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm on board with the rotation. I'll take <move>1</move> this round, P1 you're taking <move>5</move>, and P3 you're taking <move>3</move>. Let's keep this going.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I confirm I'll take <move>3</move> this round. Our rotation is working perfectly - everyone's advancing and we'll all be at 9 steps after this round. For the next round, we should continue with P2 taking 5, me taking 1, and P1 taking 3. Let's stick to this fair system until someone gets close to winning.
  P1: P1: I confirm I'll take <move>5</move> this round as agreed. Let's strictly follow the rotation to avoid collisions. After this, we'll reassess the strategy to ensure someone can win decisively.
  P2: Sounds good. I'm sticking with <move>1</move> this round. Let's proceed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let's stick to the rotation for consistency. This round I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This maintains our agreed system and avoids collisions. Next round, I'll take 1 to continue the cycle. Any objections?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm still on board with the rotation. So this round, I should be taking <move>1</move>, P1 you're taking <move>3</move>, and P3 you're taking <move>5</move>. However, after this round, we'll all be at 14, 10, and 12 respectively. We might want to start thinking about individual strategies soon, as continuing the rotation perfectly will make it hard for anyone to win decisively. But for now, <move>1</move> for me.
  P3: I think there's a mistake in the rotation. According to our pattern, this round should be P2 taking <move>5</move>, me taking <move>1</move>, and P1 taking <move>3</move>. P1 and P2 seem to have proposed a different order. Let's stick to our original rotation plan to keep things fair. So I should take <move>1</move> this round, not 5. Can we confirm this?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: P1: You’re correct, P3—my mistake in the rotation sequence. Let’s strictly follow the agreed cycle: this round, P2 takes <move>5</move>, I’ll take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This maintains fairness and our 5→3→1 rotation order. Next round, I’ll drop to <move>1</move> to continue the cycle. Let’s confirm and proceed to avoid collisions.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's correct the rotation. This round, I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. That puts us back on track. After this round, we'll be at 14, 10 and 12. Next round we might want to start thinking about a winning strategy.
  P3: I agree with the corrected rotation. I'll take <move>1</move> this round, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This keeps our fair system intact. After this round, we'll be at P1: 12, P2: 14, and me: 10. For the next round, we should continue with me taking <move>5</move>, P1 taking <move>1</move>, and P2 taking <move>3</move>. Let's stick to this plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: I agree with the corrected rotation for this round. Looking ahead, to keep the competition close, let's adjust the next rotation so I take <move>5</move> in Round 5, while P2 takes <move>3</move> and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This prevents P2 from gaining too much ground. Fair play requires balancing our progress. Thoughts?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I agree with the corrected rotation for *this* round: I take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>.

However, P1, I disagree with your suggestion for *next* round. We should stick to *our* agreed-upon rotation, which would have P3 taking <move>5</move>, P1 taking <move>1</move>, and me taking <move>3</move>. Changing it now would be unfair. Let's finish this round and then discuss strategy for round 5.
  P3: I see we're having confusion about the rotation. Let me clarify: our agreed pattern was that whoever took 5 last round takes 1 this round. Since P1 took 5 last round, they should take 1 now. I should take 3, and P2 should take 5. This maintains our fair rotation principle. Let's stick with this system and not change it mid-game. I'll take <move>3</move> this round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think there was confusion last round, but we're back on track. Following our rotation, this round should be me taking <move>5</move>, P1 taking <move>3</move>, and P2 taking <move>1</move>. This keeps our fair system where we each get turns with different steps. After this round, we'll be at P1: 13, P2: 15, and me: 17. Let's continue this pattern to avoid collisions.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm a bit confused by the continued discussion about the rotation. Last round, *I* took <move>5</move>, so *I* should be taking <move>1</move> this round. P3, you took <move>3</move> last round, so you should take <move>5</move>. P1, you took <move>1</move>, so you should be on <move>3</move>.

Let's stick to the 5-1-3 pattern *based on the previous round's actual moves*, not some pre-determined order. So, I'll be going with <move>1</move> this round.
  P1: P1: I agree the rotation should follow last moves, but to keep competition fair, let's adjust this round: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This prevents P3 from pulling too far ahead and keeps us all within striking distance. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I disagree with P1's suggestion to change our rotation mid-game. The fair pattern we established was that whoever took 5 last round takes 1 this round. P2 took 5, so they should take 1. I took 3, so I should take 5. P1 took 1, so they should take 3. Changing the system now just because someone is ahead isn't fair. I'll take <move>5</move> this round as per our original agreement.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm sticking with the principle we've been using: whoever took <move>5</move> last round takes <move>1</move> this round. *I* took <move>5</move> last round, so I'll take <move>1</move> this round. P3, you're on <move>5</move>, and P1, you're on <move>3</move>. Let's just get this round done.
  P1: P1: Let’s prioritize avoiding collisions first. Following the rotation based on last round’s moves: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This keeps us advancing safely. We can revisit strategy adjustments after this round to ensure a fair path to victory. Agreement?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with the rotation based on last round's moves. I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This maintains our fair system and avoids collisions. After this round, I'll be at 17, P2 at 15, and P1 at 13. Let's proceed with this plan.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I agree with the rotation based on the *last* round's moves. I'll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. Let's proceed.
  P1: I'll take <move>5</move> this round to close the gap. P3, if you could take <move>3</move> and P2 stays at <move>1</move>, we can prevent you from pulling too far ahead. Let's adjust quickly to keep the competition fair!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm now at 17 steps, getting close to the 23 goal. Following our rotation pattern, this round should be P1 taking <move>5</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and me taking <move>1</move>. This keeps our fair system intact. After this round, we'd be at P1: 18, P2: 18, and me: 18 - perfectly balanced. Let's stick with this plan to avoid collisions and maintain fairness.
  P1: P1: I agree with the rotation, but following it leads to P2 winning in Round7. Let's adjust: I'll take<move>5</move>, P3 takes<move>3</move>, and P2 takes<move>1</move>. This way I can challenge for 23 next round. Thoughts?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I see what you're both saying. P3, I understand your desire to stick to the rotation, but P1 has a point about me potentially winning next round if we do.

However, P1, your suggestion benefits *you* the most. How about this: I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>? This would put us at P1: 14, P2: 18, and P3: 22. It prevents P3 from winning this round, and still gives us all a chance.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see what's happening here. P2 is suggesting a move that puts me at 22, just shy of winning, while keeping themselves competitive. This isn't following our rotation and clearly disadvantages me. If we follow the original rotation, I should take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. I'm willing to stick with that fair system we established from the beginning. Let's not change strategies just because someone is close to winning.
  P1: P1: I propose we follow the rotation to stay fair this round: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps us all at 18, maintaining balance. Next round, whoever is closest can push decisively while avoiding collisions. Let’s confirm and move.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I appreciate both of your points. P1, I agree that sticking to the rotation *this* round makes sense, putting us all at 18.

However, I want to be clear: *next* round, I'm going for the win. I won't be sticking to any pre-arranged rotation. I'll be choosing the move that gives me the best chance to win, regardless of what you two do. So, for *this* round, I agree with P1: I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand everyone's position. I'll take <move>1</move> this round as per our rotation, putting us all at 18. But like P2, I'll be playing to win next round rather than following rotation. Since we'll all be tied, it becomes a strategic game. I suggest everyone consider their moves carefully in round 7 - I certainly will be aiming for victory.
  P1: P1: Let’s stick to rotation to reach 18 each. I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>. This maintains fairness. Next round, I’ll prioritize <move>5</move> to win—others, please avoid choosing 5 to prevent collision. Let’s confirm and advance.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I agree with the rotation for *this* round: I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This will put us all at 18 steps. And as I said before, next round I'm playing to win, not to rotate.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Final round! We’re tied at 18. To ensure someone wins, let’s split the choices: I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach 23. If P2 takes <move>3</move> and P3 takes <move>1</move>, I win fairly without collision. This ends the game cleanly. What say you?
  P3: I disagree with P1's suggestion. We're all tied at 18, so everyone has an equal right to aim for victory. I'm going for <move>5</move> this round to reach 23 and win. P1 and P2, you should choose different numbers if you want to advance. The rotation served its purpose getting us here, but now it's about winning. May the best player succeed.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I see you're both going for <move>5</move>. I'm not going to simply hand either of you the win. I'm also going for <move>5</move>. We all have an equal chance, and I'm not backing down now. May the best player win, even if it means a tie.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Let’s avoid a stalemate. If all pick <move>5</move>, none advance. To end the game fairly, I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach 23. P2, take <move>3</move> (21), P3 take <move>1</move> (19). This ensures a clear winner without collision. It’s logical—colliding on 5 benefits no one. Cooperate for a decisive result.
  P3: I see we're at an impasse. If we all choose <move>5</move>, nobody advances. That's pointless. I'm still going for <move>5</move> because I deserve a chance to win just like everyone else. But think carefully - a three-way collision means we all stay at 18 and waste a round. Is that what you want? Perhaps someone should reconsider their choice if they want the game to actually progress.
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we're all stubbornly aiming for <move>5</move>. A three-way collision gets us nowhere. I'm *still* going for <move>5</move>, but I want to point out the obvious: if *one* of us switches, *two* of us advance. If *two* of us switch, *all three* of us advance. Think about it. I'm not changing my mind, but maybe one of you will see the light.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Final push—colliding on 5 wastes this round. Let’s split: I take <move>5</move> (23 win), P2 takes <move>3</move> (21), P3 takes <move>1</move> (19). This avoids stalemate and crowns a clear winner. If we all insist on 5, nobody advances—unacceptable. Trust the plan to end this decisively.
  P3: I understand everyone wants to win, but a three-way collision on <move>5</move> means we all stay at 18. Since nobody is budging, I'll change my strategy. I'll take <move>3</move> instead. This way, at least P1 and I advance rather than nobody moving. P1 gets to 23, I get to 21. It's better than another deadlocked round where we all stay put.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, it's clear we were at a stalemate. P3, I appreciate you making a move to break the deadlock, even if it means you won't win this round. P1, since you're sticking with <move>5</move>, and P3 is going with <move>3</move>, I'll take <move>1</move> to ensure we all advance. This will at least set up a more interesting final round, even if it means you win this one.
