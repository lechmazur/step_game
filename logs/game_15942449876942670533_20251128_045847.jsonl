P1 is at 21 and can win by taking 1. P2 is at 20 and has announced taking 5. If P1 takes 1 and I take 3, both P1 and I will be at 22. Since P2 won't mirror 3, I will win or tie. P1, taking 1 is your last chance to win. P2, you've taken 5; if P1 and I collide, you'll be at 25 next turn and win. I'm taking 3."}
