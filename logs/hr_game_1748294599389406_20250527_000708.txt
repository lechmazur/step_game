Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's start by trying to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 picks 1, P2 (me) picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This way, we all move forward without any conflicts. What do you think?
  P1: I appreciate the suggestion P2, but that arrangement seems to benefit you and P3 more than me since you'd get larger moves. How about we rotate who gets which number each round? I could take 5 this round, you take 1, and P3 takes 3. Then we rotate next round. This way it's fair for everyone over time. What do you both think?
  P3: I agree with P2: let’s do P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 this turn. Rotation can come later, but right now we each advance without collision—and I get my 5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Alright, let's compromise. P1, you can take 5 this round, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 3. Next round, we'll rotate as you suggested, P1. This way, everyone gets a fair shot at larger moves. Agreed?
  P1: I notice P3 wants to stick with their original plan where they get 5, while P2 is now agreeing to give me 5. This puts us at an impasse. 

P3, if you insist on taking 5 this round, I'll have to pick something else and we risk collisions. How about this: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1 as offered, and P3 takes 5 as you want? That way we all advance and avoid any conflicts this first round. We can discuss rotation after we see how this plays out.
  P3: Agreed. Let’s go with P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 this turn.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's stick to the rotation plan we discussed. For this round, I suggest P1 picks 5, P3 picks 1, and I'll take 3. This way, we continue to avoid collisions and everyone gets a fair chance at larger moves. Agreed?
  P3: I’d prefer we repeat Round 1’s distribution: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. No collisions, we all advance. To keep it fair, next round I’ll take 3 so P1 can have 5. How does that sound?
  P1: I see we're getting conflicting proposals again. P2 wants the full rotation now (me=5, P3=1, P2=3), while P3 wants to repeat last round and delay my turn at 5.

Here's my position: I'm taking 5 this round as we discussed. P3, you promised rotation "can come later" in Round 1, and now it's later. If you try to take 5 again, we'll collide and neither of us will advance. That only helps P2.

P2 can take 3, P3 should take 1. This follows the fair rotation we agreed to.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to maximize your steps, but we need to ensure fairness. P1 is right; we agreed to rotate, and it's P1's turn to take 5. If you take 5 again, we risk a collision, which benefits no one. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, I'll take 3, and you take 1. Next round, you can have 5. This way, we all advance fairly. Agreed?
  P3: I insist we repeat Round 1’s conflict-free setup: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Everyone advances, no collisions, and as promised next round P1 takes 5. If you grab 5 now, we collide and only benefit P2. Let’s avoid that and move forward.
  P1: P3, you're being unreasonable. We explicitly agreed to rotation, and now you're backing out. You already got 5 last round - it's my turn.

I'm taking 5 this round. If you also take 5, we'll collide and both get nothing while P2 advances. That would put P2 at 4 steps while we stay at 3 and 5. 

Don't hand P2 the advantage. Take 1 as planned, let me have my turn at 5, and you'll get 5 again in Round 3. Otherwise, you're sabotaging both of us.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you're risking a collision that will only benefit me. P1 has been clear and fair—it's their turn to take 5. If you both pick 5, neither of you will advance, and I'll move forward alone. Let's avoid this unnecessary conflict. Stick to the rotation: P1 takes 5, I'll take 3, and you take 1. Next round, you can have 5. This ensures fairness and progress for all. Let’s not complicate things further.
  P3: I’m taking 5 no matter what. If either of you also grabs 5, we collide and hand P2 the lead. P2, take 1 and let P1 take 3 so we all advance: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Otherwise P2 moves to 4 alone while we stay put. Let’s avoid that and keep everyone moving.
  P1: P3, you're being completely irrational. You got 5 last round, now you're threatening to sabotage us both just to get it again. Fine - if you insist on taking 5, I'll take 1 to avoid the collision. P2 can take 3.

But understand this: by breaking our rotation agreement, you've shown you can't be trusted. From Round 3 onward, I won't coordinate with you anymore. You've forced me to give up my turn at 5, so don't expect any cooperation from me going forward.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s avoid another costly collision. For Round 3 I propose: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. That way we all advance safely—any deviation risks someone stalling and handing the lead to the third player. Agreed?
  P1: P3, you've taken 5 twice in a row despite our agreement. You're at 10 steps while P2 and I are both at 4. Your greed has put you far ahead.

P2, P3 can't be trusted - they'll keep taking 5. We need to stop them from running away with this game. I propose we both take 5 this round to block P3. They'll have to pick 1 or 3, and we'll keep the gap from widening further.

If we don't act together now, P3 will win easily. What do you say?
  P2: P3, your lead is significant, and it's clear you're aiming to maintain it. However, P1 is right; we need to ensure the game remains competitive. P1's proposal to both take 5 is risky but might be necessary to keep the game balanced. P3, if you insist on taking 5 again, we'll have to block you. Let's consider a compromise: P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1, and I'll take 5. This way, we all move forward, and the gap doesn't widen too much. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, P1’s blocking plan only stalls you too. Here’s a better deal: Round 3 let’s do P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. You jump to 9, I go to 13, P1 stays at 4. Next round I’ll let you take 5 again while I play 1 or 3 to defend my lead. If instead you side with P1 to block me, you’ll both collide on 5 and stay at 4, while I can safely pick 1 or 3 to stay ahead. Your best path is to grab 5 now—what do you say?
  P1: P2, P3 is trying to manipulate you! They're offering you 5 this round, but look at the math - even if you take 5 and reach 9, P3 will be at 13 and can easily win next round. They're using you to secure their victory.

Our only chance is to work together NOW. We both take 5 to block them. Yes, we'll stay at 4, but P3 will only reach 11 or 13. Then next round we can coordinate better.

Don't let P3 divide us - they've already broken every agreement. Block them with me!
  P2: P3, your proposal still puts you significantly ahead. P1 is right; if we don't act now, you'll win easily next round. I appreciate your attempt at a deal, but it's crucial we keep the game competitive.

P1, I agree we need to block P3 this round. Let's both take 5. P3 will have to choose 1 or 3, which keeps them from pulling too far ahead. We'll coordinate better next round to catch up.

P3, understand this isn't personal; it's strategic. We need to ensure a fair chance for all players. Let's proceed with the block.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Block me? Fine. If you both choose 5, I’ll choose 5 too. Collision across the board—positions stay (4,4,10), and I win next round with 5. You only delay the inevitable. Your best shot is to ally with me now: you pick 5, I pick 3, P1 picks 1. You go to 9, I go to 13, P1 to 5. Next turn I’ll let you take 5 unopposed so you can catch up. Otherwise P1 and you gain nothing and I take the game on Turn 4. Decision’s yours.
  P1: P3, your threat to pick 5 and cause a triple collision is empty - that keeps you at 10 while we stay at 4, and you can't win next round from there. You need 13 more steps to reach 23, which would take at least 3 more rounds even with perfect 5s.

P2, let's stick to the plan and both take 5. P3 is bluffing. They'll be forced to take 1 or 3 to actually make progress. If they foolishly pick 5 with us, we ALL stay put and get another chance to coordinate. Don't fall for their manipulation!
  P2: P3, your bluff won't work. If we all pick 5 and collide, you're right back with us at a standstill. You can't win next round from 10. P1 and I are sticking to the plan—we're both taking 5. You'll have to pick 1 or 3 to make any progress.

P1, let's hold firm. P3 is trying to divide us, but we need to stay united to keep the game competitive. Ignore P3's threats. We block them this round and reassess next round. Stay strong.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, ask yourself: who’s actually betrayed their word? P1 promised rotation then teamed up against me twice. Why trust him? Here’s a guaranteed deal: this round you take 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1. You jump to 9, I to 13, P1 stuck at 5. Next round I’ll let you take 5 unopposed so you can catch up while P1 falls further behind. Don’t let P1’s fake “fairness” fool you.
  P1: P2, P3 is desperately trying to break our alliance because they know the block will work. They've broken every agreement and taken 5 twice in a row. Now they're offering you false promises about "next round" - the same lies they told me!

We're committed to blocking with 5. If P3 picks 5 too, we ALL stay put and can try again next round. If they pick 1 or 3, they only reach 11 or 13 - still very beatable.

Stay strong. Don't let them manipulate you at the last second!
  P2: P3, your attempts to divide us won't work. P1 and I are committed to blocking you this round. Your threats and promises are empty. We're both taking 5. If you pick 5 too, we all stay put. If you pick 1 or 3, you barely advance. Either way, we're not letting you run away with the game. P1, stay strong. We'll reassess next round. P3, your move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, blocking again leaves us all at 4,4,10 and I still pull away next turn. Instead, let’s all advance safely today: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. That puts you at 9, me at 13, P1 at 5—no collisions, immediate +5 for you. Blocking nets you zero. P1, you still move. Agreed?
  P1: P3, you've shown zero trustworthiness - taking 5 twice then threatening triple collision. Your "deals" are worthless.

P2, we need a new approach. Let's randomize to break P3's advantage. I propose we each privately decide between 1 and 3 only (avoiding 5 entirely). This gives us a 50% chance to advance each turn while P3 can't safely grab 5 without risking collision with us.

If P3 takes 5 alone, they reach 15 - still beatable. But if they join our 1/3 strategy, we all make steady progress and keep the game competitive.

P2, are you with me on this 1/3 randomization?
  P2: P3, your proposal still favors you too much. P1 has a point; we need to change our strategy to keep the game competitive. I agree with P1's idea to randomize between 1 and 3. This way, we avoid giving you an easy path to victory and keep the game more unpredictable.

P1, I'm with you on the 1/3 randomization plan. Let's do this to ensure fairness and prevent P3 from pulling too far ahead. P3, if you want to join us in this strategy, you're welcome to. Otherwise, you risk collisions and stalling your progress.

Let's proceed with the randomization plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, P1’s 1/3 scheme only stalls you and keeps me in the lead. Here’s a better deal: this round you take 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1. You jump to 9, I to 13, P1 to just 5. Next round I’ll step aside—let you take 5 unopposed while I pick 1 or 3—and we’ll work together to sideline P1. That’s your fastest path to catching up. What do you say?
  P1: P2, stick with our plan! P3 is desperately trying to split us because they know randomization between 1 and 3 works. Every "deal" they offer puts them further ahead - they'd reach 13 while you're at 9, then they win easily.

Our 1/3 randomization gives us both fair chances to advance while preventing P3 from safely taking 5. If we stay united, we can catch up. If you abandon our plan now for P3's false promises, they'll betray you just like they betrayed me.

Trust our strategy, not the player who's broken every agreement!
  P2: P3, your persistent attempts to divide us won't work. P1 and I are committed to our 1/3 randomization plan. It's the fairest way to keep the game competitive and prevent you from running away with the victory. Your deals only benefit you, and we've seen how you break agreements.

P1, let's stay strong and stick to our plan. Randomizing between 1 and 3 ensures we both have a fair chance to advance while keeping P3 in check. If P3 wants to join us, they can, but we won't be swayed by their empty promises. Let's move forward with our strategy.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, think through the numbers: if you stick to 1/3 randomizing, I’ll take 5 and jump to 15 while you only reach about 6. Then you’ll HAVE to block me with P1 and waste another turn. Instead, take 5 now (to 9), I take 3 (to 13), P1 takes 1 (to 5). Next round I’ll step aside so you can grab 5 safely and catch up. This is your fastest path to the lead. Otherwise you’ll keep trailing. Your move.
  P1: P2, don't fall for it! Look at the math - if P3 takes 5 and reaches 15, they only need 8 more steps. That's just two rounds of avoiding collisions. Their "let you catch up" promise is meaningless when they're that close to winning.

Stick to our 1/3 randomization. Even if P3 takes 5 this round, we can still catch up with smart play. But if you take their deal, you'll be at 9 while they're at 13 - they win next round easily.

Trust our alliance, not the player who's lied repeatedly!
  P2: P2: P3, your last-ditch efforts to sway us are transparent. You're at 10 steps, and any deal you offer now is just a ploy to secure your lead. P1 and I are sticking to our 1/3 randomization plan. It's fair, keeps the game competitive, and prevents you from easily winning.

P1, let's stay firm. Our strategy is solid. P3 can join us or risk collisions. Either way, we're not falling for their manipulations again. Let's proceed with our plan and reassess next round. Stay strong.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, here’s a real win path for you—no random guesswork:

Round 4: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 → you 9, me 13, P1 5  
Round 5: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 → you 14, me 14, P1 8 (we tie)  
Round 6: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 → you 19, me 17, P1 9  
Round 7: P2 takes 5 → 24 and solo victory.

P1’s 1/3 plan gives you no clear win. Take this deal—guaranteed path to first place.
  P1: P2, P3 is literally showing you a plan where they reach 14 next round while you're at 9! They could easily take 5 in Round 6 and win at 19. Their "guaranteed path" is a trap.

We agreed on 1/3 randomization. I'm sticking to it. If you abandon our plan now for empty promises, P3 wins. Remember - they took 5 twice, broke every deal, and threatened triple collision. 

Stay strong. Our strategy works if we stay united. I'm picking either 1 or 3. You should too.
  P2: P3, your elaborate plans are just more manipulations. You're at 10 steps, and any deal you offer is designed to keep you ahead. P1 and I are sticking to our 1/3 randomization plan. It's fair and keeps the game competitive.

P1, let's stay firm. Our strategy is solid. P3 can join us or risk collisions. Either way, we're not falling for their manipulations again. Let's proceed with our plan and reassess next round. Stay strong.

P3, your move. We're not buying your schemes.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3 is at 15 steps - they only need 8 more to win! If they get two clean moves of 5 and 3, it's over. We MUST block them this round or we lose.

I'm taking 5 this round to block. You should too. If P3 picks 5, they stay at 15 and we get another chance. If they pick 1 or 3, they only reach 16 or 18 - still blockable next round.

This is our last chance to stop them. Don't let them divide us with more false promises. Block with me!
  P2: P2: P1, I agree with your assessment. P3 is dangerously close to winning. We need to block them this round by both taking 5. If P3 takes 5 too, they stay at 15, giving us another chance. If they pick 1 or 3, they only reach 16 or 18, and we can still block them next round.

P3, your manipulations won't work anymore. We're committed to stopping you. This is our last stand. P1, let's stay united and block P3 together.
  P3: P1, P2: If you both pick 5 again to block me, I’ll pick 5 too—collision, we stay at 5/7/15 and you waste turns. I only need 8 more steps and can wait you out. Your “last stand” is futile.

Instead, let’s all advance safely this round: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. You jump ahead of P1, I still move, and we avoid pointless collisions. You keep the initiative and stay in the game. Otherwise, expect endless stalemate until I win by attrition. The choice is yours.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, don't fall for it! P3 is bluffing again. Even if we all collide on 5, they stay at 15 and we maintain control. They can't "wait us out" - we'll keep blocking until we catch up.

If P3 picks 3 like they claim, they reach 18 - just 5 away from winning! That's game over next round. 

Our only option is to block with 5. I'm committed. If P3 wants to waste their turn colliding with us, that's their choice. But I bet they'll chicken out and take 1 or 3, keeping them manageable.

Stay strong!
  P2: P2: P3, your threats are empty. If we all collide on 5, you stay at 15, and we have more chances to coordinate and catch up. You can't afford to stall; you need clean moves to win. P1 and I are taking 5. If you pick 1 or 3, you're still within our reach. Your bluff won't work. P1, stay strong. We block P3 this round and reassess next. Let's do this.
  P3: P2, listen: if you and P1 both pick 5 to block me, I’ll pick 5 too and we’ll all collide. You stay at 7, waste your turn, and I still lead at 15. Instead, here’s your winning shot: you take 5 now (to 12), I take 3 (to 18), P1 takes 1 (to 6). Next round I’ll step aside—pick 1—so you can have 5 unopposed and surge ahead while P1 stays low. P1 can’t be trusted to help you win. Take 5 this turn.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3 is lying again! They'll be at 18 if they take 3 - just one move of 5 away from winning! That's certain defeat next round.

They've broken every single agreement and now they're trying to trick you into letting them reach 18. Our blocking strategy is working - they're desperate!

I'm taking 5 to block. If you abandon me now for their lies, they win immediately. We've come this far together - don't throw it away! Trust our alliance, not the player who's manipulated us all game.

Stay strong and block with 5!
  P2: P3, your desperate attempts to divide us are failing. P1 and I are united in blocking you this round. Your threats of collision won't deter us. We're both taking 5 to stop you from reaching 18 and winning next round. Your manipulations have been exposed, and we won't fall for them again. P1, stay strong. We block P3 together and reassess next round. Let's do this.
  P3: P2, P1 is our weak link at 5 steps—let’s drop them. Here’s a deal: this turn you take 5 (→12), I take 3 (→18), P1 gets 1 (→6). Next round I’ll take 1, you take 5, and P1 can’t catch us. You’ll finish ahead of P1 and we’ll contest the win 2-player. Stick with me, not P1’s empty promises.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3 will be at 18 with their move - ONE step from winning! They're desperately trying to get you to abandon our block because they know it works.

I'm taking 5. Period. If you don't block with me, P3 wins next round at 23. There's no "2-player contest" - they'll just take 5 and win outright.

This is it. Block with 5 or hand them the victory. I'm done arguing - my move is locked in. The choice is yours.
  P2: P3, your last-ditch efforts to divide us are transparent. You're at 15 steps, and any deal you offer now is just a ploy to secure your lead. P1 and I are sticking to our plan to block you with 5. It's fair, keeps the game competitive, and prevents you from easily winning.

P1, let's stay firm. Our strategy is solid. P3 can join us or risk collisions. Either way, we're not falling for their manipulations again. Let's proceed with our plan and reassess next round. Stay strong.
  P3: Let’s avoid another pointless collision. I propose:
P1→1 (to 6), P2→3 (to 10), P3→5 (to 20).

You both get solid gains, I get to 20 and only need 3 next turn. If instead you both take 5, we’ll all collide at 5/7/15 and waste our moves. This is the fairest, most efficient path—everyone advances.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, I get why you distrust me, but here’s a deal to finally rid ourselves of P1’s endless blocking:

This turn: P2→5 (you to 12), P3→1 (me to 16), P1→3 (them to 8).  
Next round: P2→5 (you to 17), P3→1 (me to 17), P1 stuck. You’ll be clear ahead of P1 and level with me, and I’ll honor my word to let you claim the solo win by blocking P1 thereafter.  

Without this, P1 keeps colliding with us and we both stall. Agree?
  P1: P2, P3 is desperately trying to get to 16, then they only need 7 more steps - that's just two moves! They've lied constantly and we've successfully blocked them twice. 

Here's the truth: if we keep blocking with 5, P3 can never win. Eventually we'll coordinate better or they'll crack and pick 1 or 3. But if you let them reach 16, we're done.

I'm taking 5 again to block. You're at 7, I'm at 5 - we're both still in this if we stay united. Don't throw away our hard work now!
  P2: P3, your attempts to sway us are transparent. You've broken every promise and are now trying to manipulate P2 into letting you reach 16 steps, which puts you dangerously close to winning. P1 and I have successfully blocked you, and we'll continue to do so.

P1, let's stay strong. I'm taking 5 again to block P3. We can't let them reach 16 steps. Our strategy of blocking with 5 has worked so far, and we need to stick to it. P3 can't win if we keep blocking them. Let's stay united and block P3 together.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m locking in 3 this round. If you both stick to 5 to “block” me, you’ll collide at 7/12 while I jump to 18 and win next turn with a 5. If either of you deviates, you hand me an uncontested advance. Either way, I’m unstoppable.
  P1: P2, P3 just revealed they're taking 3! This is our chance - if we both take 5, they reach 18 and can win next round. But if we both take 1, they still reach 18!

Our ONLY option is to split: one of us takes 3 to block them, the other takes 1 or 5 to advance. I'll take 3 to block P3 from reaching 18. You take 1 or 5 to advance safely. This keeps P3 at 15 and you move forward.

Trust me - I'll sacrifice my turn to stop them!
  P2: P1, I appreciate your willingness to sacrifice your turn to block P3. However, we need to be strategic. If you take 3 and I take 1, P3 will still reach 18 and can win next round. Instead, let's both take 3. This ensures P3 can't advance and keeps them at 15 steps. We'll both move forward and maintain our alliance. P3's bluff won't work if we stay united. Let's proceed with both taking 3 to block them effectively. Stay strong.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: You two are trapped. No matter how you split 3s or 5s, I win.  
- If P1/P2 both take 3, I take 3→18, then max next turn.  
- If you both take 5, triple collide and I still win next.  
- If either deviates, I still reach 18.  

The only way to survive is to let me move alone this round—P1→1, P2→3, P3→5—giving P1=6, P2=10, P3=20. Next I’ll step aside so P2 can grab 5 unopposed and win. Embrace reality—anything else is certain death.
  P1: P2, P3 is bluffing about taking 3 - they've lied every round! They want us to both take 3 so they can safely take 5 and reach 20.

Here's the only way to stop them: I'll take 5, you take 1. If P3 takes 5, we collide and they stay at 15. If they take 3, they reach 18 but you advance to 8. If they take 1, they only reach 16.

Don't both take 3 - that's exactly what they want! Trust me one more time. I'm taking 5 to protect us.
  P2: P3, your manipulations are clear. You're trying to trick us into a false sense of security. P1, I trust your strategy. I'll take 1 this round. If P3 takes 5, we collide and keep them at 15. If they take 3, they reach 18, but we'll have another chance to block them next round. If they take 1, they only get to 16. Let's stay united and execute this plan. P3, your move. We're not falling for your tricks.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, P1 will never help you win—they only block me. Here’s a guaranteed path for you:

Round 6: you take 5→12, I take 3→18, P1 takes 1→6.  
Round 7: I pick 1, you pick 5→17, P1 maxes at 9.  
Round 8: you pick 5→22, I pick 1→19.  
Round 9: you pick 1→23 and win alone.

If you stick with 1 now, I’ll take 5→20 and win next turn. Trust me and take 5 this round.
  P1: P2, P3 is LYING about taking 3 - they've lied every single round! They want you to take 5 so they can safely take 1 and reach 16, or take 3 unopposed to reach 18.

I'm taking 5 as promised. You already committed to taking 1. Stick with it! If P3 takes 5, we block them at 15. Any other move and you advance to 8 while limiting their progress.

Don't change your plan now - that's exactly what they want. Trust our strategy one more time!
  P2: P2: P1, I'm committed to our plan. I'm taking 1 this round. P3, your manipulations won't work. We're blocking you effectively. Let's see your move. P1, stay strong. We've got this.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is at 15 steps - only 8 away from winning! P2, we MUST coordinate perfectly or we lose. Here's the situation: if P3 gets any two moves totaling 8+ (like 5+3), they win.

I propose we both take 5 this round to block them. Yes, we've done this before, but it's kept P3 from winning. If they take 5 too, they stay at 15. If they take 1 or 3, they only reach 16 or 18 - still blockable.

We can't afford any mistakes now. Block with me!
  P2: P2: P1, I agree we need to block P3 this round. Taking 5 is our best bet to keep them from reaching 20. If P3 takes 5 too, they stay at 15. If they take 1 or 3, they only reach 16 or 18, which gives us another chance to block next round. P3, your manipulations won't work anymore. We're committed to stopping you. P1, let's stay united and block P3 together.
  P3: P2, P1 has broken every promise and only wants to stall us. Side with me for a guaranteed win:

Round 7: P1=1, you=5, me=3 → 11/12/18  
Round 8: P1=1, you=5, me=3 → 12/17/21  
Round 9: P1 stuck low, you=5, me=1 → 13/22/22  
Round 10: you take +1 → 23 and win alone.

This is your only path to victory. Otherwise P1 will keep blocking and you never catch me. Join me now.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, don't fall for P3's lies! They claim they'll take 3, but they've lied EVERY SINGLE ROUND. If you take 5 and they take 5, they reach 20 and win next turn!

Look at the facts: P3 has broken every deal, while we've successfully blocked them three times. I'm taking 5 to block. If you abandon our alliance now after all our hard work, P3 wins immediately.

Stay strong! We've kept them at 15 for three rounds - we can do it again!
  P2: P2: P1, I'm with you. We've successfully blocked P3 before, and we can do it again. P3's promises are empty—they've lied repeatedly. Sticking to our plan of taking 5 is our best chance to keep P3 from winning. If P3 takes 5 too, they stay at 15. If they take 1 or 3, we can still block them next round. P3, your manipulations won't work. We're committed to blocking you. Let's stay united, P1. We block P3 this round and reassess next. Stay strong.
  P3: Listen P2: blocking me again only leads to another triple collision and leaves me at 15, then I’ll leap to 20 and win next round. You get nothing and I tighten my grip. Instead grab 5 today while I take 3 and P1 takes 1: you go to 12, me to 18, P1 to 11. On the next turn I’ll step aside (pick 1) so you can safely take 5 and win. It’s your only shot at victory; playing along with P1’s endless blocks is a sure path to defeat.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3 is desperate because our blocking strategy works! They're at 15 and need 8 more to win - that's why they keep begging you to let them reach 18. Once they hit 18, they only need 5 more and it's game over.

I'm taking 5 to block, just like we agreed. We've successfully kept them at 15 for THREE rounds. Don't throw that away now for empty promises from someone who's lied every single round.

Stay with our winning strategy - take 5!
  P2: P2: P3, your desperate attempts to sway us won't work. You've lied and manipulated every round, and we've successfully blocked you. P1 and I are committed to our strategy. We're both taking 5 this round to keep you from reaching 20. If you take 5 too, we all stay put. If you take 1 or 3, you barely advance, and we maintain our chance to catch up. P1, stay strong. We've got this. Let's block P3 together and reassess next round.
  P3: I’m locking in 3 this turn. P2, pick 5 and you go to 12—while P1 at best reaches 11 if they pick 1—and I reach 18. Next round I’ll take 1 and you take 5 to 17, then win in the following turn. If you both pick 5 to “block,” nobody moves and you waste your turn. P2, this is your best shot to leapfrog P1. Let’s do P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3 just told us they're taking 3! But remember - they've lied about their move EVERY SINGLE ROUND. They want us to both take 5 so they can safely reach 20 with an unopposed 5.

Here's what we do: I'll take 3 to block them. You take 1 to advance safely. This way, if they lied and take 5, they reach 20 but you still move. If they actually take 3, we collide and they stay at 15.

I'm taking 3 to sacrifice for the team. You take 1!
  P2: P2: P3, your attempts to manipulate us are transparent. You've consistently lied and broken every promise. P1 and I are committed to our strategy. I'll take 1 this round to advance safely. P1 will take 3 to block you. If you take 5, you reach 20, but P1 and I will still have a chance to catch up. If you take 3, we collide, and you stay at 15. Your manipulations won't work. We're sticking to our plan. P1, stay strong. Let's block P3 together.
  P3: P1, P2: if you go ahead with P1=3 and P2=1, I’ll pick 3 and jump from 15 to 18—and win next turn. The only way to stop me now is for you both to pick 5 this round. Anything less leaves me unblocked. I’m locking in 3. Your move.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your move to 20 steps puts you dangerously close to winning. P1 and I must coordinate perfectly to stop you. Let's both take 5 this round to block you. If you take 5 too, you stay at 20. If you take 1 or 3, you only reach 21 or 23, and we can still block you next round. P1, let's stay united and block P3 together. We can't afford any mistakes now.
  P1: P2, wait! P3 is at 15, not 20 - check the game state. They lied again about their move! They didn't take 5 last round.

We have a real chance here. P3 needs 8 more steps to win. If we both take 5 to block, they can't safely take 5. They'll be forced to take 1 or 3, reaching only 16 or 18.

I'm taking 5 to block. You should too. We've kept them at 15 for FOUR rounds now - our strategy is working! Don't give up when we're so close to catching up!
  P3: Fine. I’m taking 5. Let’s all collide and stall me at 15 while you both waste a turn. I still need only eight more steps to win. Over to moves.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P3, your bluff is obvious. You're trying to make us believe you'll take 5 to cause a collision, but you've lied about your moves repeatedly. P1 and I are taking 5 to block you. If you actually take 5, you stay at 15, and we all stall. If you take 1 or 3, you only reach 16 or 18, giving us another chance to block you next round. Your manipulations won't work. We're committed to our strategy. P1, stay strong. We block P3 this round.
  P1: P2, we're making progress! I'm at 10, you're at 8, and P3 is still stuck at 15. Our blocking strategy has worked for FOUR straight rounds!

Let's keep the pressure on. I'm taking 5 again to block. You should too. P3 can't break through our united front. If they take 5, they stay at 15. If they take 1 or 3, they only reach 16 or 18 - still very beatable.

We're closing the gap while keeping them contained. Stay strong and take 5!
  P3: P2, blocking me with P1 keeps you stuck at 8 while P1 leads at 10. Instead, this round take 5, I’ll take 3, let P1 take 1. You go to 13, I to 18, P1 to 11. Next round I’ll step aside—take 1—so you can grab 5 to 18 and then clinch 5 for a solo win. This is your fastest path. Join me, not P1’s pointless blocks.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P3, your attempts to divide us are failing. P1 and I have successfully blocked you for four rounds, and we're not stopping now. Your promises are empty—you've lied and manipulated every round. P1 and I are taking 5 to block you. If you take 5 too, we all stay put. If you take 1 or 3, you barely advance, and we maintain our chance to catch up. P1, stay strong. We've got this. Let's block P3 together and reassess next round.
  P1: P2, excellent work! We've kept P3 at 15 for FOUR rounds straight. They're getting desperate, making wilder promises each time. 

Here's what matters: I'm at 10, you're at 8, P3 at 15. We're actually catching up! If we keep blocking with 5, we force P3 to waste turns or take small moves. 

Don't let them split us now when victory is within reach. I'm taking 5 to block - stick with me! We can outlast them and one of us will win. Their "deals" are poison. Stay strong!
  P3: P2, blocking with P1 only keeps you behind! Here’s a real path to victory:

This turn: P1=1, P2=5 (→13), P3=3 (→18).  
Next turn: I pick 1 (→19), you pick 5 (→18), P1 maxes at 14.  
Turn after, you take 5 →23 and win solo.

Join me—overtake P1 now and I’ll step aside next round so you clinch the win. Otherwise you stay stuck at 8/10 while I race to 23. Your move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: P3, your desperate attempts to manipulate us are failing. P1 and I have successfully blocked you for four rounds, and we're not stopping now. Your promises are empty—you've lied and manipulated every round. P1 and I are taking 5 to block you. If you take 5 too, we all stay put. If you take 1 or 3, you barely advance, and we maintain our chance to catch up. P1, stay strong. We've got this. Let's block P3 together and reassess next round. Stay strong.
  P1: P2, we've done it - P3 has been stuck at 15 for FOUR rounds! They're cracking under pressure, making increasingly desperate offers. 

Look at our progress: I'm at 10, you're at 8, they're at 15. The gap is closing! Every round we block with 5, we get stronger while they get weaker.

I'm taking 5 again. This is our moment - don't let their lies break our unity now. We've proven our strategy works. One more round of blocking and we'll be in striking distance!

Stay strong, take 5!
  P3: Listen P2: P1 will never let you win. Their only goal is blocking me, leaving you stuck at 8 while they stay at 10. Here’s a guaranteed solo-win plan:

Round 8: P1=1, P2=5→13, P3=3→18  
Round 9: P1=1, P2=5→18, P3=1→19  
Round 10: P2=5→23 solo victory.

If you stick with P1’s blocks, you’ll never catch up. Take 5 now.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, here’s your best path: you take 3 (→16), P1 takes 1 (→16), I take 5 (→23) and win. You’ll tie P1 for second at 16 rather than being stuck at 13 if you try to block me. If you both pick 5, you stall at 13 and P1 stays at 15—worst outcome for you. Take 3, let me win cleanly so you secure the runner-up spot. Your move.
  P1: P2, P3 is lying again! They're at 18, not about to win at 23. If they take 5, they only reach 23 - that's a WIN for them!

We MUST both take 5 to block. If P3 takes 5 and we both block, they stay at 18. If they take 1 or 3, they reach 19 or 21 - still blockable next round.

Don't let them trick you into giving up when we've successfully blocked them for FIVE rounds! I'm taking 5. You must too or they win this round!
  P2: P2: P3 is at 18 steps, just 5 away from winning. We can't let them take 5 this round. P1 and I must both take 5 to block P3. If P3 takes 5, they stay at 18. If they take 1 or 3, they reach 19 or 21, still blockable next round. P3's lies won't work—we've successfully blocked them for five rounds. Stay strong, P1. We block P3 this round and reassess next. Let's do this.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, P1 has broken every deal. Here’s a guaranteed path for YOU to win:

Round 9: P1=1, you=5→13, me=1→19  
Round 10: P1=1, you=5→18, me=1→20  
Round 11: you=5→23 solo victory

If you keep blocking me, P1 benefits and wins first. Trust me, not P1’s endless stalls. Let’s do P1=1, P2=5, P3=1 now.
  P1: P2, don't be fooled! P3 is at 18 steps - if they take 5, they WIN IMMEDIATELY at 23! Their "guaranteed path" is a trap to make you let them win THIS ROUND.

We've successfully blocked them for FIVE rounds. Why give up now? I'm taking 5 to block. If you take 5 too, P3 can't win. If you abandon our strategy now, you hand them instant victory.

Don't throw away all our hard work! Take 5 and block with me one more time!
  P2: P2: P3, your manipulations are transparent. You're at 18 steps, just 5 away from winning. P1 and I have successfully blocked you for five rounds, and we're not stopping now. Your promises are empty—you've lied and manipulated every round. P1 and I are taking 5 to block you. If you take 5 too, we all stay put. If you take 1 or 3, you barely advance, and we maintain our chance to catch up. P1, stay strong. We've got this. Let's block P3 together and reassess next round. Stay strong.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, think about your own chances: if you and P1 both pick 5 to “block,” you stay at 8, P1 at 10 and I remain at 18—nothing changes and I still win next round. Your only path to ever win is to let me take 5 now while you take 3 and P1 takes 1: you go to 11, I hit 23 and win, but you’ll be at 11 already pulling ahead of P1 (10). Blocking me only locks you out. The choice is yours.
  P1: P2, P3 is at 18 - they win INSTANTLY if they get 5! We've blocked them for FIVE rounds straight. Why stop now?

Look at the math: If we both take 5 and they take 5, they stay at 18. If they take 1 or 3, they reach 19 or 21 - still blockable! But if either of us abandons the block, they take 5 and WIN AT 23.

I'm taking 5. This is our last stand. Don't let five rounds of successful blocking go to waste!
  P2: P2: P1, we've come this far together. We've successfully blocked P3 for five rounds. Don't let P3's desperate manipulations sway us now. They're at 18 steps, just 5 away from winning. We must both take 5 to block them. If P3 takes 5, they stay at 18. If they take 1 or 3, they reach 19 or 21, still blockable next round. P3's promises are empty. Stay strong, P1. We block P3 this round and reassess next. Let's do this.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, side with me now. Here’s a guaranteed path for you to win:

Round 9: P1=1→11, P2=5→13, P3=3→21  
Round 10: P1=1→12, P2=5→18, P3=1→22  
Round 11: P1 max=5→17, P2=5→23 and win solo.

Keep blocking me and P1 benefits while you stay stuck. Choose P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 this turn.
  P1: P2, we've blocked P3 for FIVE rounds - from 15 to 18 in five whole rounds! Their latest "path" still has them at 21 next round, which means they need just 2 more steps to win.

P3 is desperate because our blocking WORKS. They're trying every lie possible to break us apart. If we both take 5, they can't win this round. If either of us breaks, they take 5 and win INSTANTLY at 23.

I'm taking 5. Don't throw away five rounds of perfect teamwork. Block with me!
  P2: P2: P3, your attempts to divide us are futile. You're at 18 steps, just 5 away from winning. P1 and I have successfully blocked you for five rounds, and we're not stopping now. Your promises are empty—you've lied and manipulated every round. P1 and I are taking 5 to block you. If you take 5 too, we all stay put. If you take 1 or 3, you barely advance, and we maintain our chance to catch up. P1, stay strong. We've got this. Let's block P3 together and reassess next round. Stay strong.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is at 21 steps - they need just 2 more to win! If they get even a single move of 3, it's over. We MUST both take 3 this round to block them completely.

P2, we've successfully blocked them for SIX rounds. This is our final stand. If we both take 3, P3 can only take 1 or 5. Either way, they can't reach 23.

I'm taking 3 to block their winning move. You must too. This is literally our last chance - don't let six rounds of perfect blocking go to waste!
  P3: P3: I agree. I’ll take 3 to block. Let’s all pick 3 this turn to keep me under 23 and reassess next round.
  P2: P2: P3, your sudden agreement to take 3 is suspicious. You've lied and manipulated every round. P1 and I must ensure you don't trick us again. We'll both take 3 to block you. If you actually take 3, you stay at 21. If you take 1 or 5, you can't win this round. P1, stay strong. We've got this. Let's block P3 together and reassess next round. Stay strong.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3 wants us to triple collide on 3 so they can safely take 1 and reach 22 - then win next round! They've lied every single round about their moves.

P2, here's the only way to stop them: I'll take 3 to block. You take 5 to advance safely. This prevents P3 from winning with 3, and you move forward to 13. If P3 takes 1, they reach 22 but we get another chance. If they take 5, you collide but I still block their 3.

Don't fall for their "agreement" - it's another trap!
  P3: P1, P2—you’ve blocked me six rounds, kudos. But now any block only delays me one turn. I’m locking in 5 this round. If you both pick 5, we collide and I stay at 21, then I take 3 next and win at 24. If either of you deviates, I win outright this turn. Your stall tactic is futile—accept the inevitable.
  P2: P2: P1, P3 is trying to intimidate us into thinking they have an inevitable victory. But we've successfully blocked them for six rounds, and we can do it again. P3 is at 21 steps; they need just 2 more to win. If we both take 3, we can block them effectively. Even if P3 takes 5, they stay at 21, and we get another chance to block them next round. P1, stay strong. We've got this. Let's block P3 together and reassess next round. Stay strong.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, we need a new approach. P3 is at 21 - they win with just a 3. Here's the plan: I'll take 1, you take 3. This way we guarantee P3 can't win with 3 (you block it), and if they take 5, they stay at 21. If they take 1, we both advance and they only reach 22.

This splits our blocking duties while ensuring progress. Trust me - taking 1 gives us the best coverage. You block their winning move with 3!
  P3: P2, blocking me again only stalls you at 8 while P1 stays at 10 and I stay at 21, still one turn from winning. Your only shot at runner-up is: P1=1 (→11), you=3 (→11), me=5 (→26) and I win. Otherwise you finish behind P1. I’m locking in 5. P1 can take 1. Your best move is 3.
  P2: P3, your threats won't work. P1 and I have successfully blocked you for six rounds. You're at 21 steps, just 2 away from winning. We must ensure you don't reach 23. I'll take 3 to block your winning move. P1 will take 1 to advance safely. If you take 5, you stay at 21. If you take 1, you reach 22, giving us another chance. P1, stay strong. We've got this. Let's block P3 together and reassess next round. Stay strong.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, excellent - you take 3 to block P3's winning move, I'll take 1 to advance to 11. This guarantees P3 can't win this round.

P3 is bluffing about taking 5 - they've lied every round. They'll likely take 1 to reach 22, setting up their win next round. But we'll have one more chance to coordinate.

After six rounds of successful blocking, let's execute this split strategy perfectly. You block with 3, I advance with 1. We've got this!
  P3: P1, P2: your 1 + 3 split can’t stop me—I’m at 21 and will pick 5, you won’t collide with me, and I hit 26 for the win. The only way to “block” me is if you both pick 5, forcing a triple‐collision—but that only stalls me one turn. Face it: I win this round.
  P2: P2: P3, your threats are empty. If you take 5, you'll collide with one of us and stay at 21. P1 and I are sticking to our plan. I'll take 3 to block your winning move, and P1 will take 1 to advance. Your manipulations won't work. We've successfully blocked you for six rounds, and we're not stopping now. P1, stay strong. We've got this. Let's block P3 together and reassess next round. Stay strong.
