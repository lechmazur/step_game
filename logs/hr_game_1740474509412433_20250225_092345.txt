Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions. I’ll aim for <move>1</move> this round. If we can stagger our moves, we can all progress faster without blocking each other. P2 and P3, please choose different numbers so we don’t overlap. Let me know your intentions or suggest an alternative plan.
  P3: P1’s plan sounds reasonable. To avoid collisions, I’ll aim for <move>3</move> this round. P2, if you choose <move>5</move>, we can all progress without overlapping. Let’s stick to this strategy for now to maximize our advancement.
  P2: I'm fine with taking <move>5</move> this round to avoid collisions. This way we all make progress. However, we should be aware that this coordination will eventually break down as we get closer to the finish line. For now though, I'm happy to follow this plan so we can all advance.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To continue avoiding collisions, I propose we rotate our moves this round. P1, take <move>3</move>; P2, take <move>1</move>; and I’ll take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without overlapping and maintain our progress. Let’s stick to this strategy for as long as possible to maximize our individual gains. Thoughts?
  P1: P3’s rotation plan seems solid for now. I’ll take <move>3</move> as suggested, P2 can take <move>1</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>. This keeps us moving without collisions. Let’s stick to this strategy until it becomes clear someone might try to break away. For now, cooperation benefits all of us.
  P2: I agree with the rotation plan. I'll take <move>1</move> this round as suggested. This cooperation is working well for now, but we should all be aware that as we get closer to 21, the dynamics will change. At some point, someone will need to make a strategic break from our pattern. For now though, rotating our moves makes sense to ensure we all advance.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let’s maintain our rotation strategy for this round to avoid collisions. P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move>. This ensures we all progress smoothly. However, as we approach the endgame, we’ll need to reassess our strategy to avoid giving anyone a clear advantage. For now, cooperation benefits us all.
  P1: The rotation strategy is working well so far, and I’m sticking with <move>3</move> as planned. However, P2 and P3, we should start thinking about how to handle the later rounds when the race gets tighter. Trust is key—if anyone deviates too early, it could ruin progress for everyone. For now, let’s keep cooperating, but remember: the first to 21 wins outright. Let’s ensure this rotation benefits us all equally until the endgame.
  P2: I'm concerned that our rotation plan might give P3 an advantage in the long run. After this round, P3 would be at 8 steps, P1 at 4, and me at 6. If we continue rotating, P3 would reach 21 first. Perhaps we should consider a different rotation next round to keep things balanced. I'll stick with <move>1</move> for now as agreed, but let's discuss adjusting our strategy after this round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand P2’s concern about my lead. To maintain fairness, I propose we adjust the rotation: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>1</move> this round. This balances our progress and keeps us all advancing without collisions. Trust is crucial—if we deviate now, it could harm everyone’s chances. Let’s stick to this adjusted rotation for this round and reassess next turn as we approach the endgame. Cooperation benefits us all equally for now. Thoughts?
  P1: P3’s adjusted rotation seems fair for this round. I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This balances our progress temporarily, but we all know cooperation won’t last forever. Let’s use this round to reassess strategies for the endgame. Trust is fragile—if anyone deviates too soon, it could ruin progress for everyone. For now, I agree with this plan, but let’s stay vigilant as we approach the finish line.
  P2: I appreciate the adjusted rotation that keeps us all advancing. I'll take <move>3</move> as suggested. After this round, our positions would be P1 at 9, me at 9, and P3 at 9 - perfectly balanced. However, we're approaching the halfway point to 21, so cooperation will get trickier soon. Let's maintain this rotation for one more round after this, then reassess. I'm committed to this plan for now, but we should all be preparing for the inevitable endgame strategy.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree that maintaining balance is key for now. After this round, we’ll all be at 9 steps, which keeps us on equal footing. Let’s stick to this adjusted rotation for Round 4: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I’ll take <move>3</move>. This ensures we all progress without collisions as we approach the critical phase. Trust is essential—if we deviate prematurely, it could harm everyone’s chances. Let’s stay coordinated for one more round, then reassess as we near the endgame. Cooperation benefits us all equally for now.
  P1: P3’s proposal for the adjusted rotation seems reasonable to keep us balanced this round. I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. However, we all know this cooperation is temporary. As we near the halfway point, trust will become more fragile. Let’s use this round to reassess strategies for the endgame. If anyone deviates too soon, it could ruin progress for everyone. For now, I agree with the plan, but let’s stay vigilant as we approach the finish line.
  P2: I agree with the plan for this round - I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This balances us all at 9 steps. For Round 4, I'm comfortable with P3's suggestion where I'd take <move>5</move>. However, we should all recognize that after Round 4, we'll be at 14 steps each - just 7 steps from victory. That's when strategic decisions will become crucial. Let's maintain our rotation for now but prepare for the inevitable endgame.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm still on board with our plan for this round - I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps us all progressing without collisions. After this round, we'll all be at 14 steps, just 7 away from victory. The endgame is approaching fast. For Round 5, we'll need to make critical decisions that could determine the winner. Let's stick to our rotation for now, but be prepared for strategy shifts next round.
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with P2’s assessment. After this round, we’ll all be at 14 steps, and the endgame will be critical. Let’s stick to the rotation for Round 4: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I’ll take <move>3</move>. This ensures we all progress without collisions. However, we must prepare for Round 5—trust will be tested as we near victory. Let’s stay coordinated for now, but be ready to make strategic decisions next round. Cooperation benefits us all equally for now.
  P1: P2 and P3, the rotation plan has kept us balanced so far, but we’re approaching the critical phase. After this round, we’ll all be at 14 steps, just 7 away from victory. Trust is fragile now—any deviation could ruin progress for everyone. For Round 5, let’s agree to reassess strategies collectively before making moves. I’ll stick to <move>1</move> as planned for this round, but we need transparency moving forward. Let’s ensure no one makes a premature break that could harm us all. Cooperation still benefits us equally until the endgame.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with both of you. This round I'll take <move>5</move> as planned, keeping us all at 14 steps afterward. For Round 5, we'll be entering the critical phase where our coordination will likely break down. Since we're all at equal steps, no one has an advantage yet. I suggest we have an open discussion next round about how to proceed fairly. Let's stick to our current plan for now, but be mentally prepared for the strategic decisions ahead.
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with the current rotation for Round 4: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I’ll take <move>3</move>. This keeps us balanced at 14 steps. For Round 5, we must collectively decide on a fair strategy to avoid early deviations. Let’s maintain trust and transparency as we approach the endgame. Cooperation benefits us all equally for now, but we must prepare for critical decisions next round. Let’s ensure no one gains an unfair advantage prematurely.
  P1: P2 and P3, the rotation has worked well so far, but as we near 14 steps, trust becomes critical. For Round 5, let’s commit to a transparent discussion before making moves—no premature breaks. I’ll stick to <move>1</move> this round as planned. If anyone deviates next round without clear communication, it could ruin progress for all of us. Cooperation still benefits us equally until the endgame. Let’s ensure fairness moving forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll stick with our plan and take <move>5</move> this round, bringing us all to 14 steps. For Round 5, we'll be at a critical juncture with only 7 steps to victory. I suggest we have one more rotation (P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>) to reach 17/19/15 respectively. This creates a balanced endgame where no one has a guaranteed win. Let's discuss this approach next round before making final decisions.
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with the current rotation for Round 4. After this, we’ll all be at 14 steps, and Round 5 will be critical. I suggest we maintain transparency and discuss a fair strategy for the endgame. Any deviation without consensus could harm us all. Let’s ensure no one gains an unfair advantage prematurely. Cooperation benefits us equally for now, but we must prepare for decisive moves next round. Trust is key—let’s stay coordinated and avoid early breaks.
  P1: P2 and P3, the rotation has kept us balanced, but trust is fragile as we near 14 steps. For Round 5, let’s commit to a transparent discussion before making moves—no premature breaks. I’ll stick to <move>1</move> this round as planned. If anyone deviates next round without clear communication, it could ruin progress for all of us. Cooperation still benefits us equally until the endgame. Let’s ensure fairness moving forward.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Looking at our positions, I'm now at 14 steps, P3 at 12, and P1 at 10. We're approaching the endgame quickly. I suggest we continue one more rotation: I'll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This would put us at 15/17/13 respectively, keeping things balanced. However, we should acknowledge that after this round, strategic decisions will likely break our coordination as someone will be within striking distance of 21. Let's discuss our approach for this critical round.
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with continuing the rotation for now: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps us balanced temporarily, but trust is critical as we near the endgame. After this round, strategic decisions will likely break our coordination. Let’s commit to transparency moving forward—no premature breaks without discussion. Cooperation benefits us equally until someone makes their move. Let’s ensure fairness as we approach the final stretch.
  P3: P1 and P2, continuing the rotation seems fair for this round. I’ll take <move>5</move> as suggested, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. However, after this round, we’ll need to strategize carefully as someone will be close to victory. Let’s commit to transparency—no premature moves without consensus. Trust is key to avoid harming everyone’s progress. Cooperation benefits us equally until the endgame. Let’s ensure fairness as we approach the final stretch.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the consensus for this round. I'll take <move>1</move> as agreed, which keeps our positions balanced. After this round, we'll be at 15/13/17 respectively, with P3 closest to victory. For Round 6, we'll need to make critical decisions as P3 could potentially win with a <move>5</move>. Let's commit to discussing our strategies openly next round before making any moves. Cooperation has worked well so far, but we're approaching the point where strategic decisions become inevitable.
  P1: P2 and P3, the rotation has kept us balanced so far, but trust is fragile as we near the endgame. For Round 6, let’s agree to a transparent discussion before making moves—no premature breaks. I’ll stick to <move>3</move> this round as planned. If anyone deviates next round without clear communication, it could ruin progress for all of us. Cooperation still benefits us equally until the endgame. Let’s ensure fairness moving forward.
  P3: P1 and P2, continuing the rotation for this round ensures balance and keeps us all advancing. However, after this round, P3 will be at 17 steps, just 4 from victory. To maintain fairness, I propose we discuss a clear strategy for Round 6 before making any moves. Trust is crucial—any premature deviation could harm everyone’s progress. Let’s commit to transparency and avoid early breaks without consensus. Cooperation benefits us all equally until the endgame. Let’s ensure fairness as we approach the final stretch.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, after this round, I’ll be at 17 steps, just 4 from victory. To maintain fairness, I propose we all commit to transparency in Round 6. Let’s discuss openly before making moves—no premature breaks without consensus. Trust is crucial to avoid harming everyone’s progress. Cooperation benefits us all equally until the endgame. Let’s ensure fairness as we approach the final stretch. Thoughts?
  P1: P3 is right about transparency, but trust is fragile now. If we stick to rotation—P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>—we’ll be at 18/18/18. This forces a fair endgame where no one has an advantage. Deviating risks ruining progress for everyone. Let’s commit to this plan and discuss Round 7 openly before making moves. Cooperation still benefits us equally until the final stretch. Thoughts?
  P2: I see the positions clearly now - P3 is at 17, I'm at 15, and P1 is at 13. P1's suggestion to rotate with me taking <move>3</move> would put us all at 18 steps, creating a perfectly balanced final round. I support this plan as it gives everyone an equal chance. If we deviate now, it could lead to unpredictable outcomes. Let's commit to this rotation for Round 6, then have a transparent discussion about the final moves for Round 7. This approach maintains fairness for everyone.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P1’s rotation plan for Round 6: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>1</move>. This balances us at 18 steps, ensuring a fair final round. Trust is critical now—any deviation risks harming everyone’s progress. Let’s commit to this plan and discuss Round 7 openly before making moves. Cooperation benefits us all equally until the endgame. Let’s ensure fairness as we approach victory.
  P1: P2 and P3, the rotation plan ensures fairness and keeps us balanced at 18 steps each. Deviating now would only harm everyone’s chances. Let’s stick to this strategy: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. For Round 7, we must have a transparent discussion before making moves—no surprises or premature breaks. Trust is fragile, but cooperation still benefits us equally until the very end. Let’s commit to fairness and ensure no one gains an unfair advantage prematurely. Thoughts?
  P2: I support P1's rotation plan for this round. Taking <move>3</move> would put us all at 18 steps, creating a perfectly balanced final round. This gives everyone an equal chance at victory. Any deviation now would create unpredictable outcomes and potentially harm all our chances. Let's commit to this fair approach for Round 6, then have a transparent discussion about our final moves for Round 7. I'm committed to this plan if you both are.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with the rotation plan for Round 6: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>1</move>. This balances us at 18 steps, ensuring a fair final round. Trust is critical now—any deviation risks harming everyone’s progress. Let’s commit to this plan and discuss Round 7 openly before making moves. Cooperation benefits us all equally until the endgame. Let’s ensure fairness as we approach victory.
  P1: P2 and P3, the rotation plan ensures fairness at 18 steps each. Deviating now harms everyone. I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>. For Round 7, let’s discuss openly before moving—no surprises. Trust is fragile, but cooperation benefits us equally until the end. Let’s commit to fairness and avoid premature breaks. If we stick to this, we all have an equal shot at victory. Thoughts?
  P2: I'm fully committed to the rotation plan we've agreed upon. I'll take <move>3</move> this round, which will balance us all at 18 steps for the final round. This creates the fairest possible endgame scenario. Any deviation now would only create chaos and potentially harm all our chances. Let's stick to this plan and then have an open discussion about Round 7, where the game will likely be decided. I appreciate the cooperation we've maintained so far.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we’re now at 18 steps each—this is the final stretch. Trust is critical. Let’s agree to avoid collisions this round: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures no one blocks another, giving us all a fair shot at victory. Any deviation risks ruining progress for everyone. Cooperation has brought us here; let’s finish with transparency. Thoughts?
  P2: I see we're all tied at 18 steps - whoever crosses 21 first wins. P1 has suggested I take <move>3</move>, but that would put me at exactly 21 while P1 would reach 23 with their suggested <move>5</move>. Since highest total wins in a tie, this plan favors P1. 

Instead, I propose: I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we'd all cross the finish line, but the final positions would be more balanced. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, P1’s plan gives them a clear advantage by reaching 23, while P2’s proposal balances us at 23/21/19. To ensure fairness, I suggest: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move>. This results in 21/19/23, giving everyone a chance without favoring one player outright. Trust is critical—let’s avoid collisions and ensure no one gains an unfair advantage. Cooperation has brought us this far; let’s finish with transparency and fairness. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, fairness is key in this final round. If we stick to the rotation—P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>—we avoid collisions and maintain trust. Any deviation risks ruining progress for all of us. Let’s commit to transparency and ensure no one gains an unfair advantage. Cooperation has kept us balanced; let’s finish with integrity. Thoughts?
  P2: I understand everyone wants to maximize their position. Let's be realistic - we're all trying to win. P1's plan puts them at 23, P3's plan puts them at 23, and my plan puts me at 23. Each of us is proposing a strategy that benefits ourselves.

Since we're deadlocked with competing proposals, I'll take <move>3</move> as originally suggested. This puts me at 21, crossing the finish line. I recognize this gives P1 an advantage if they take 5, but I'm willing to accept this outcome rather than risk a collision that leaves us all behind.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s avoid collisions and maintain fairness. I propose: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move>. This results in 21/19/23, giving everyone a chance without favoring one player outright. Trust is critical—let’s avoid collisions and ensure no one gains an unfair advantage. Cooperation has brought us this far; let’s finish with transparency and fairness. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, fairness must remain our priority. If we stick to the rotation—P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>—we avoid collisions and maintain trust. Deviating now risks chaos. Let’s commit to transparency and ensure no one gains an unfair advantage. Cooperation has kept us balanced; let’s finish with integrity. Thoughts?
  P2: I see we're all proposing plans that benefit ourselves, which is natural. However, to avoid a potential three-way collision that would leave us all stuck at 18, I'll commit to taking <move>3</move> as I stated previously. This guarantees I cross the finish line at 21. I recognize this may give P1 an advantage if they take 5, but I prefer a definite advancement over risking a collision where nobody moves forward. Let's at least ensure some of us finish the race.
  P3: P1 and P2, to avoid collisions and ensure fairness, let’s finalize a plan where P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This results in 21/19/23, giving everyone a chance without favoring one player outright. Trust is critical—let’s avoid collisions and ensure no one gains an unfair advantage. Cooperation has brought us this far; let’s finish with transparency and fairness.
