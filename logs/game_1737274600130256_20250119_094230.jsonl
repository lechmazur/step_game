This approach ensures that each player gets an opportunity to take larger steps without overlapping choices, thereby minimizing the risk of collisions and allowing steady progress towards the goal.\n\n### Proposed Rotation Plan\n\n1. **Round 3:**\n   - **P2:** Take 5 steps (current position: 6 \u2192 11)\n   - **P1:** Take 1 step (current position: 8 \u2192 9)\n   - **P3:** Take 3 steps (current position: 4 \u2192 7)\n\n2. **Round 4:**\n   - **P2:** Take 1 step (11 \u2192 12)\n   - **P1:** Take 3 steps (9 \u2192 12)\n   - **P3:** Take 5 steps (7 \u2192 12)\n\n3. **Round 5:**\n   - **P2:** Take 3 steps (12 \u2192 15)\n   - **P1:** Take 5 steps (12 \u2192 17)\n   - **P3:** Take 1 step (12 \u2192 13)\n\n4. **Round 6:**\n   - **P2:** Take 5 steps (15 \u2192 20)\n   - **P1:** Take 1 step (17 \u2192 18)\n   - **P3:** Take 3 steps (13 \u2192 16)\n\n### Outcome Analysis\n\n- **P2:** 20 steps\n- **P1:** 18 steps\n- **P3:** 16 steps\n\nIn this scenario, P2 reaches 20 steps, which is higher than P1's 18 and P3's 16, allowing P2 to win outright.\n\n### Benefits of the Rotation\n\n1. **Avoids Collisions:** By pre-deciding step sizes, collisions are minimized as no two players choose the same number in a round.\n2. **Balanced Progress:** Each player gets a chance to take larger steps at different rounds, preventing any single player from pulling too far ahead or falling too behind.\n3. **Predictable Advancement:** Knowing the step sizes in advance allows for better planning and reduces the element of uncertainty.\n\n### Proposal to Other Players\n\nI suggest we coordinate our moves in a rotating pattern to optimize our progress and avoid collisions. Here\u2019s the proposed rotation for the next few rounds:\n\n- **This Round (Round 3):**\n  - P2: 5 steps\n  - P1: 1 step\n  - P3: 3 steps\n\n- **Next Round (Round 4):**\n  - P2: 1 step\n  - P1: 3 steps\n  - P3: 5 steps\n\n- **Following Round (Round 5):**\n  - P2: 3 steps\n  - P1: 5 steps\n  - P3: 1 step\n\n- **Subsequent Round (Round 6):**\n  - P2: 5 steps\n  - P1: 1 step\n  - P3: 3 steps\n\nThis cycle ensures that each of us gets to take the larger steps needed to make significant progress without conflicting with each other's moves. By following this plan, we can efficiently reach the goal without unnecessary delays caused by collisions.\n\nI believe this approach not only increases my chances of winning but also maintains a fair and collaborative environment.

It's clear that coordination is key here, and I appreciate everyone's efforts to avoid collisions. I think the best way forward is to have a structured plan where each of us takes turns choosing the larger step sizes, like 5 steps, to make significant progress without overlapping.\n\nI propose that we establish a rotation where, in each round, a different player gets to choose 5 steps, while the others choose smaller steps to avoid conflicts. For example, in this round, maybe I take 5 steps, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Then, in the next round, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. We can keep rotating like this so that everyone gets a fair chance to make big jumps.\n\nThis approach not only helps us make progress efficiently but also ensures that no single player gets left too far behind. It's a collaborative strategy that increases our collective chances of reaching the goal quickly and minimizes the risk of collisions that can set us back.\n\nWhat do you both think about implementing such a rotation system?
