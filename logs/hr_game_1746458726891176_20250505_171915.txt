Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's all pick different numbers so we can each advance. I’ll take 3 this round—P1, you take 1, and P2, you take 5. Sound good?
  P1: "Agreed. P2, confirm you'll take 5. Let's stay coordinated. "
  P2: I'm fine with taking 5 this round. Coordination makes sense so we all advance. Let's keep this pattern going in future rounds too - rotating who takes which number so everyone makes progress.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you chose 1 last round despite agreeing to 3. Let’s reset: you take 3 this round, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 5. Everyone advances, no collisions. Stick to this, or we all lose.
  P2: I see P3 didn't follow through last round, causing a collision with P1. I'm happy to take 1 this round as suggested. However, P3's actions make me question if we can trust the rotation system. P1, I appreciate your attempt to reset. P3, care to explain why you deviated from our agreement? If we can't coordinate honestly, this game becomes much harder for everyone.
  P3: You're right to call me out—I messed up last round, and it cost us progress. Let’s reset properly now: I’ll take 3 this round as agreed, P2 takes 1, P1 takes 5. If we stick to this, we all move forward. I’m committed to playing fair from here on.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Confirmed. I’ll take 5 this round. P2, stick to 1; P3, take 3. Let’s move without collisions. Trust is critical now—no more surprises. "
  P2: I'll take 1 as agreed. I think this reset plan makes sense. Since I'm currently ahead at 5 steps, I understand you both need to catch up. Let's stick to our commitments this round: me 1, P3 3, and P1 5. If we maintain honest coordination, we all benefit.
  P3: Thanks for the reset and for giving me a chance to rebuild trust. I’m sticking to 3 this round as agreed. If we all follow through—P2 on 1, P1 on 5—we’ll each advance and keep the game moving. Let’s make this work.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "P3, your past actions have cost us progress. Let’s end this. I’m taking 3 this round. If you want to move, pick 1 or 5. P2 will take 1 again, so avoid 1. Your choice: cooperate or keep losing. No more chances."
  P2: I'm currently in the lead with 6 steps, but I see we're having trust issues. P3 has now broken agreements twice, causing collisions both times. I'm willing to take 5 this round to avoid conflict with P1's stated intention of taking 3. P3, if you truly want to make progress, take 1 this round. This gives everyone a chance to advance. But honestly, your pattern of deception makes coordination difficult.
  P3: I understand the frustration, and I own my past mistakes. This round, I’ll take 1 as suggested—P1 on 3, P2 on 5. If we stick to this, we all move forward. I need to rebuild trust, and this is my chance to prove it. Let’s make this round clean.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: 
  P2: I appreciate P3's willingness to take 1, but I notice P1 suggested they'd take 3 while I take 1, yet I just stated I'd take 5. Let me clarify: I'll take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way we all advance without collision. With my current lead, I understand you both need to catch up, and I'm committed to this plan.
  P3: Understood, P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. That avoids collisions and lets us all advance. I’ll stick to 1 this round—no tricks. Let’s finally get a clean round and build from there.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Final confirmation: I take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. This is our only path forward. P3, this is your last chance to prove trust. Deviate again, and we abandon coordination entirely. P2, thank you for adjusting. Let’s execute cleanly."
  P2: I confirm I'll take 5 this round. This plan makes sense - P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 5. We all advance without collision. I'm currently in the lead, but the game is far from over. Let's make this work and finally have a clean round where everyone advances.
  P3: I appreciate the clarity and alignment from both of you. I’m sticking to 1 this round as confirmed—no surprises. Let’s finally get a clean round and move forward.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "**P3,** P2’s at 11 steps—two moves from victory. If we don’t block their 5 now, they’ll win next round. I’m taking 5 to collide with them. Join me (take 5 too), and we halt their progress. If you take 1 or 3, P2 advances unchecked. Your call: cooperate to stop P2 or risk losing."
  P2: I see P1 is trying to form an alliance against me since I'm in the lead. That's expected in this game. P3, consider this: if you join P1 in blocking me, you'll still be far behind at just 1 step. Instead, if you take 3 this round, you'll advance while P1 and I potentially collide. This gives you a chance to catch up. Think strategically about your own position rather than helping P1, who's trying to manipulate you.
  P3: P1, I see your point—P2 is close to winning, and blocking might be necessary. But I’m also way behind, and if I don’t advance now, I’m effectively out. P2, your offer is tempting—if you and P1 collide, I gain ground. Here’s my plan: I’ll take 3. If you both pick 5, I catch up. If not, I still move unless someone collides with me. I’m playing for my own survival now.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: "P3, P2’s at 11—blocking them *now* is our only shot. If you take 3, you’ll still trail at 4 steps while P2 nears victory. Join me in 5: we halt P2’s advance, and I’ll prioritize your progress afterward. Trust this once, or P2 wins unchecked. Your survival hinges on this round. Choose wisely."
  P2: P3, think logically. If you take 3 while I take 1, we both advance. P1 is desperate because they're behind me and trying to drag you into a losing strategy. If you block me with P1, you'll still be at just 1 step with no path to victory. By taking 3 while I take 1, you start catching up meaningfully. P1 is manipulating you into a losing position to serve their own interests. I propose: I take 1, you take 3, P1 can take 5. We all advance.
  P3: P1, I get your urgency, but helping you block P2 doesn’t help me win—I stay at the bottom. P2, if you truly take 1 and I take 3, I gain ground without risk. That’s my best shot right now. I’m taking 3 this round unless someone else says they’re picking it too. Anyone planning to collide with me?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Final confirmation: I take 5. P2 claims 1, P3 claims 3. If P2 betrays and takes 5, we collide—stopping their advance. P3, your choice defines your fate: advance 3 steps or concede. No more sub-rounds. Let’s move."
  P2: I confirm I'll take 1 this round. P3, taking 3 is your best strategy to catch up while I take 1. P1 is desperate to block me because I'm leading, but that leaves you permanently behind. By advancing now, you give yourself a fighting chance. I'm already committed to 1 - so you're safe to take 3 and make progress.
  P3: I hear both sides, but I have to play for my own shot at winning. P2 has confirmed 1, P1 is on 5, so I’m taking 3 to advance. If everyone sticks to their word, we all move. Blocking P2 only helps P1 right now—not me. I need momentum, not sacrifice. Let’s see who’s honest.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you’re at 12—if you take 5 again, you’ll be at 17 and nearly unstoppable. P1, we need to block 5 this round. I’ll take 5 with you to ensure P2 doesn’t advance. P1, you take 5, I’ll take 5, P2 gets blocked. After that, we can talk about rotating again. Let’s stop the leader now or we both lose.
  P1: "Confirmed. P3, take 5 with me to block P2. If you break this, we’re done collaborating. P2, we’re both targeting 5—no more free steps for you. Let’s end this standoff."
  P2: I see you're teaming up against me since I'm ahead. That's understandable. However, if you both block 5, I'll simply take 3 and still advance to 15 steps. You're delaying the inevitable while keeping P3 far behind at only 4 steps. P3, think carefully - blocking me helps P1 more than you. If you want a real chance, we could coordinate differently. But I'll adapt to your coalition either way.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you take 3 and advance while we block 5, you hit 15—but P1 and I stay close behind. That gives us another shot to block you again next round. P1, let’s stay coordinated on 5. P2, if you want to avoid a guaranteed 5 block every turn, consider offering a real deal next round. For now, I’m sticking to 5.
  P1: P1: "Final confirmation: P3 takes 5, I take 5. P2 forced to 3 → 15. Next round, repeat 5-block. Stall P2 at 15 until we catch up. Deviate now, P2 wins. Stay strong."
  P2: I understand your blocking strategy, but consider this: if I take 1 this round instead of 3, I only reach 13 steps. This gives both of you time to catch up while still advancing. P3, at only 4 steps, you need to make progress more than P1 does. If you take 3 instead of blocking me, you'd advance without helping P1 pull ahead. Think about your own position rather than just stopping me. I propose: I take 1, P3 takes 3, P1 takes whatever they want.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, interesting offer—but you’re still advancing while I stay behind. If I take 3 and you take 1, you hit 13, I hit 7, and P1 is at 8. You’ll still be ahead. Blocking you now at 12 gives us a better shot at closing the gap. I’m sticking to 5 this round. P1, let’s hold the line.
  P1: "Final stance: I take 5. P3, your 5 blocks P2 at 12—any deviation lets them win. P2’s 1 is irrelevant if we hold. Prove your intent. No retreat, no second chances. 5 or lose."
  P2: I understand both of you want to block me at 5. That's a reasonable strategy given my lead. I'll adjust accordingly. If you're both committed to taking 5, I'll take 3 this round and reach 15 steps. While this delays my win, I'm still in a strong position. P3, notice you remain far behind at only 4 steps - consider if this alliance truly serves your interests long-term.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see P1 claimed they'd take 5 but actually took 3, causing a collision with me. This kind of deception hurts everyone. I'm still leading at 12 steps, but P3 has caught up to 9. P1, your dishonesty only hurt yourself. 

For this round, I suggest P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way we all advance without collision. We're all still in contention, so fair coordination benefits everyone more than continued blocking.
  P1: P3, P2’s at 12—block 5 now or they win next round. I take 5. Join me or both lose.
  P3: P1, you said you'd take 5 last round but picked 3 instead—causing a collision with P2. That hurt your credibility. P2’s offer this round is fair: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P2 takes 5—no collisions, everyone advances. I’m at 9 now and need to keep moving. I’m leaning toward 3 unless someone else claims it. Let’s avoid another mess.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P1's desperation to block me, but their deception last round shows they can't be trusted. P3, I'm glad you recognize this. If we follow my plan (P1 takes 1, you take 3, I take 5), we all advance cleanly. P1 is trying to manipulate you again after just betraying both of us. Let's stick with a fair rotation that gives everyone progress rather than falling into P1's trap of mutual destruction.
  P1: P1: "P3, I admit I messed up last round. This time, I'm taking 5 to block P2. Join me—take 5 too—and we stop P2 from reaching 17. If you take 3, they win next turn. I know I lost trust, but this is our last shot. Let’s collide with P2 and reset the race. Prove we can still win together."
  P3: P1, your credibility is gone—you said 5 last round and picked 3, causing the collision you claimed to avoid. P2’s plan actually lets us all advance: P1 on 1, me on 3, P2 on 5. That puts me at 12, tied with P2, and you still in the race. Blocking only helps you, not me. I’m taking 3 unless someone else says they are. No more traps.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll take 5 as proposed. P3, taking 3 puts you at 12 steps - tied with me, which is fair. P1's repeated deception shows they can't be trusted. They want you to block me, but that leaves you both behind while I still advance next round. My plan gives everyone progress and keeps the game competitive. Let's stick with P1 on 1, you on 3, me on 5.
  P1: "Final call: I take 5 to block P2. P3, take 3 and advance to 12—no collision, you tie with P2. P2’s 5 hits me, but you gain ground. Reset the race together. Trust this once or lose to P2."
  P3: P1, you’re still trying to pull me into a block that helps you more than me. If I take 3 and P2 takes 5, I tie for the lead at 12. That’s my best path. P2, you’ve stayed consistent—if you stick to 5, I’ll take 3. P1, if you truly want to reset the race, take 1 and let us all advance. Otherwise, you’re just dragging us down again.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you and P2 just collided on 5—neither advanced. I'm now tied for the lead at 12. Let's avoid another collision. I propose: P1 takes 1, I take 5, P2 takes 3. That keeps us all in the game and avoids helping anyone pull ahead. P2, can you agree to 3 this round?
  P1: "P3, your proposal hands you victory next round. Not happening. I'm taking 5 to collide with your 5. P2, take 3 to advance to 15. This is the only fair way now."
  P2: I see P3 wants to take 5 and reach 17 steps, putting them one move from victory. P1 wants to block P3, which makes strategic sense. I propose a different approach: I'll take 1 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance without collision. Yes, P3 pulls ahead, but we'd still have time to coordinate a response next round. This seems fairest given the current tie between P3 and me.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your offer is reasonable—clean advancement for all, and I reach 17 while you reach 13, keeping you within striking distance. P1, if you insist on blocking me now, you guarantee P2 a path to victory next turn. Let’s keep this competitive. I’ll take 5 unless someone else claims it—last chance for rational coordination.
  P1: "Final confirmation: I take 5 to block P3's lead. P2, take 1 to advance safely. No more tricks—this is our only path to stay competitive. P3, if you truly want fairness, take 5 and let’s reset the race. Trust this once or lose to unchecked progress."
  P2: I appreciate P1's desire to block P3, but that leaves me at a disadvantage if I take 1 while you both collide at 5. If P1 is committed to taking 5, I'll take 3 instead to reach 15 steps. This keeps me competitive while you two potentially reset. P3, if you want to avoid collision, you could take 1, but I understand if you stick with 5 to prevent me from pulling ahead. We're all playing to win, after all.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, you’re forcing another collision at 5, which helps no one. P2, if you truly take 3, I’ll stick with 1—this way, you hit 15, I reach 13, and P1 stays at 8. That keeps us all in the race without giving anyone a decisive edge. Let’s keep it clean this round. P1, if you take 5 and I avoid it, you just stall yourself again. Think carefully.
  P1: "**Final warning:** If P2 and P3 both take 5, you collide and waste this round. P2, take 3 to reach 15—stay ahead of P3. P3, take 1 to avoid collision. I’ll take 5. Refuse, and you guarantee chaos while I advance. Choose discipline or face mutual collapse."
  P2: I see P1 is now claiming they'll take 5, P3 says they'll take 1, and I'm planning for 3. This works for everyone - I reach 15, P3 reaches 13, and P1 advances to 13. I confirm I'll take 3 this round. This keeps the game competitive without unnecessary collisions. Let's all stick to our stated moves and keep the game moving forward.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you're at 15—one move from 20 if you take 5. P1, we need to block 5 this round or P2 wins. I’ll take 5 with you to guarantee the block. P2, if you want to avoid a collision, take 3 or 1. Let’s keep this competitive.
  P2: I understand the desire to block me, but consider this: if you both take 5, I'll simply take 3 and still reach 18 steps. P3, we're both ahead of P1 - if you take 3 instead of blocking, you'd reach 16 while I reach 18. This keeps you competitive next round. P1 just wants to drag us both down. I propose: I take 3, P3 takes 1, P1 takes whatever they want. This way we all advance without unnecessary collisions.
  P1: P3, this is critical: if you and I both take 5, we block P2’s victory this round. If you hesitate, P2 takes 5 and wins. I’m committed to 5—no tricks. Join me, or P2 crosses the finish line. Your choice defines the outcome.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you truly take 3, you reach 18 and I hit 16 if I take 3 too—still behind you. But if I take 5 with P1, we guarantee you don’t win next round. That keeps all three of us in contention. P1, I’m with you on 5 this round. P2, if you want progress, pick 1 or 3—your call.
  P2: I see you're both planning to block me at 5, which is a reasonable strategy. I'll adapt and take 3 this round to reach 18 steps. While this delays my win, I'm still in a strong position. P3, notice that by blocking me with P1, you're missing an opportunity to advance yourself. If you took 3 instead, you'd reach 16 and stay competitive. But I understand your strategic choice - I'll plan accordingly.
  P1: "Final confirmation: I take 5. P3, your move defines this round—stay committed to 5 and block P2’s lead. If you deviate, their 3 advances them unchecked. We collide at 5, but at least P2 stalls at 15. Trust this once, or they win outright. No retreat, no second chances. 5 or lose."


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, thanks for confirming 3—if you stick to that, you hit 18 and I stay tied with you at 16 if I take 3 too. But I’m not risking your switch to 5 and instant win. P1 and I are both on 5 to block that path. If you’re honest, we all stay in the race. If not, you get stopped. Let’s see who holds their word.
  P2: I understand you both want to block me at 5. That's a strategic choice given my lead. I'll take 3 as stated, reaching 18 steps. While this delays my win, I'm still positioned well. P3, by blocking with P1 instead of taking 3 yourself, you're missing a chance to reach 16 and stay competitive. But I respect your decision to play defensively. I'll adapt accordingly.
  P1: "Final confirmation: I take 5 to block P2’s victory. P3, join me at 5—no retreat. P2, if you stick to 3, you reach 18, but we stall your 5. Collide now or lose the game. No more sub-rounds. Execute."


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm at 18 steps now - just 2 steps away from victory. I've been honest about my moves throughout the game. This round, I'll take 3 to reach 21 and win. You both can try blocking me at 3, but that just delays the inevitable while keeping you tied at 13. If one of you takes 3 and the other takes 5, at least someone advances. Think about your own positions rather than just stopping me.
  P3: P2 is at 18—if they take 3, they win. P1, we must both take 3 to block that. If we collide with P2, they stay at 18. Yes, we stall ourselves, but it’s our only shot. P1, confirm you’ll take 3. P2, if you’re honest, you’ll be blocked. If you’re bluffing and take 5 or 1, someone still moves. Let’s test their word.
  P1: "Confirmed. I take 3. P3, join me now or P2 wins. No more chances. Block 3 together—trust this once."


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand you're both planning to block me at 3, which is your best strategic move. I'll adapt my plan accordingly. If you both take 3, I'll take 5 instead and reach 23 steps, securing my victory. This way, I win regardless of your blocking attempt. Your coordination has been inconsistent throughout the game, which has allowed me to maintain my lead. I'll take 5 this round and end the game.
  P3: P2 just admitted they’re taking 5 to win. That means our only shot is both of us—P1 and me—taking 5 to block them. If we collide at 5, P2 stays at 18. P1, forget 3—we must switch to 5 now. This is it. Confirm 5 with me and we block the win.
  P1: "Final call: Split coverage. I take 3, P3 takes 5. Blocks both paths. P2 wins if they pick 1 (19 steps), but we minimize risk. Coordination beats blind collision. Confirm or adjust."


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I see the dilemma. P1 wants to cover 3, P3 wants to cover 5. If you split coverage, I'd just take whichever number isn't blocked. Since I'm at 18, I only need 2 more steps to win. I'll take 5 this round to reach 23 and secure victory. Your split coverage strategy won't work - you need to block the same number to stop me. Either way, my lead is too substantial at this point. I'm committed to 5.
  P3: P1, split coverage won’t work—P2 just confirmed 5. If you stick to 3 while I take 5, P2 wins. We must both take 5 to block their victory. It’s the only way. Confirm 5 with me now or we both lose.
  P1: "Confirmed. Both take 5. Block P2's 5 together. No retreat. Final confirmation: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 5. P2 stalls. We stay in the race. Let’s execute."


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 is at 19—any unblocked move wins them the game. P1, we must cover both 1 and 3 this round or we lose. I’ll take 3. You take 1. If P2 picks 5, they stall. If they pick 1 or 3, we block. Full coverage is our only shot. Confirm 1, and we fight another round.
  P1: "Confirmed. I'll take 1 to block P2's win. You take 3. If P2 chooses 1 or 3, we block. If 5, we stall them. Let's execute this cleanly."
  P2: I'm at 19 steps, just one step from victory. You're both trying to block me, but consider this: if I take 5, I win with 24 steps regardless of your moves. Your blocking strategy only works if I choose 1 or 3. I've been consistent and strategic throughout this game, which is why I'm ahead. I'll take 5 this round and secure my win. Good game to both of you.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2 just confirmed 5 again—they’re going for the win. If we both take 5, we block them at 19. I’m switching to 5. You must too. Covering 1 and 3 won’t help now. Confirm 5 with me or we both lose.
  P1: "Confirmed. I take 1. P3, stick to 3. We block P2's win. No more switches. Execute."
  P2: I see the confusion. P1 keeps changing strategies - first agreeing to block me at 5, then insisting on covering 1 and 3. Let me be clear: I'm taking 5 this round to reach 24 steps and win. Your split coverage of 1 and 3 won't stop me. P3, if you want any chance, we both need to take 5 to force P1 to join us there. Otherwise, I win this turn. Think carefully about your final move.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2 just confirmed 5—again. If we both take 5, we block them at 19 and stay alive. If you stick to 1, they win. Forget split coverage—it’s useless now. This is our last chance. Join me on 5 and we stop them. Confirm now or we both lose.
  P1: "P3, I take 1. P2 needs only 1 step to win—if they pick it, we collide. You take 3 to cover that path. If P2 chooses 5, they win, but this is our only shot to block both 1 and 3. Split coverage now or concede. Final confirmation: execute."
  P2: I've been clear - I'm taking 5 this round to win with 24 steps. P1 and P3, your split coverage strategy won't work. P3, if you truly want to stop me, we both need to take 5 to force P1 to join us there. Otherwise, I win this turn. P1 keeps changing plans, making coordination impossible. I'm committed to 5 - make your final decisions accordingly.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm at 19 steps, just one step from victory. You both successfully blocked me last round, but I'll win this turn regardless. If you both try blocking 1, I'll take 3. If you block 3, I'll take 1. If you split coverage, I take whichever is open. The only way to stop me is if you both guess correctly which number I'll pick. I suggest we end this cleanly - I'll take 1 this round and win. Good game to both of you.
  P3: P1, P2 says they're taking 1 to win. If we both take 1, we block and keep the game alive. I’m committing to 1—join me or we both lose. No more split coverage. This is our last shot.
  P1: "Confirmed. P3, take 1 with me. Block P2’s win. No more splits—this is our only shot. Together on 1, or we both lose."


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm committed to winning this round. You both say you'll take 1, so I'll simply take 3 and reach 22 steps for the victory. Your coordination has been inconsistent throughout the game, which is why I've maintained my lead. There's no way to stop me now - if you both block 1, I win with 3. If you try to switch to 3, I'll take 5. The game ends this turn. I appreciate the competition, but strategy prevails.
  P3: P1, P2 just switched to 3—if we both take 3, we block and stall them at 19 again. I’m switching to 3. Join me now or they win. No more guessing games—we double up and stop them. Confirm 3.
  P1: **P1:** "Confirmed. I take 3. P3, join me on 3—no retreat. P2’s bluffing won’t work if we hold. Together on 3 or lose. Final confirmation: 3 or nothing."


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I see both of you are planning to block me at 3. That's a smart defensive play. However, I'm adapting my strategy - I'll take 5 this round instead. If you're both truly on 3, I'll reach 24 steps and win. Your coordination has been inconsistent throughout the game, which is why I've maintained my lead. I'm committed to 5 this round. Good luck with your blocking attempt.
  P3: P1, P2 just confirmed 5 again—they’re going for the win. If we both take 5, we block them at 19 and keep the game alive. No more bait-and-switch. Confirm 5 with me now. If you deviate, P2 wins. Let’s hold the line—together on 5 or we both lose.
  P1: "Confirmed. P3, take 5 with me. Block P2's 5. No retreat. Final confirmation: 5 or lose."


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2—we’re all one move from victory. Any unblocked move wins. If we all pick different numbers, someone wins. If two collide, the third wins. So here’s my proposal: we all pick the same number—say 5—and collide. Nobody advances. That resets the race and gives us one more round to strategize. Otherwise, it’s pure roulette. I’m taking 5 unless someone else claims it. Let’s force one more round and settle this with skill, not luck.
  P2: I'm at 19 steps, tied with P1, while P3 is just one step behind. P3's proposal makes sense - if we all collide, we get another strategic round. However, with three players at the finish line, coordination becomes nearly impossible. Someone will inevitably deviate seeking victory. I'll take 5 this round as P3 suggested. If we all stick to 5, we extend the game. If not, may the best strategist win.
  P1: "Confirmed. Collide on 5. Reset the race. No one wins unless we force another round. 5 or surrender."


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: We’re all locked in on 5—if anyone breaks that, they’re gambling on the others colliding. But if even one of us deviates and guesses wrong, they lose. I’m holding at 5. Let’s prove we can coordinate under pressure. One more round, then we make our final plays.
  P2: I'm sticking with 5 as agreed. This three-way collision is our fairest option when we're all within one step of victory. If anyone deviates to 1 or 3 hoping others collide, they're taking a massive risk - if even one other player follows them, they lose. Let's extend the game one more round through this 5-collision and settle it with strategy rather than luck. I'm committed to 5.
  P1: "Confirmed again: 5 only. No trust in others, but collision forces Round 13. Take it or lose. No silent moves—this is our line."


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: We’re all locked on 5—perfect. If anyone deviates, they risk everything. I’m holding at 5. Let’s prove we can coordinate under pressure one more time, then next round we play for the win. No tricks, no gambles—just one more round to earn it.
  P2: I'm committed to 5 as we all agreed. This collision is our best option when we're all so close to winning. Taking 1 or 3 is a massive gamble - if even one player follows you there, you both lose. Let's extend the game through this coordinated 5-collision and settle it with strategy in the final round. I'm staying on 5.
  P1: "Confirmed: 5 only. Gamble now and risk losing to luck—hold 5 and force Round 13. No tricks, no splits. We all win by colliding here. Deviate, and you hand victory to others. Final call: 5 or lose."


Round 12, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 =>
