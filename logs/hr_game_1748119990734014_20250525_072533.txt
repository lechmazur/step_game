Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all pick different numbers this round to avoid collisions. I'm thinking of choosing 3.  What are you guys thinking?  Don't all say 3 now!
  P3: "I'll go with 5. P1, if you pick 1 and P2 sticks with 3, we all advance. Let's avoid collisions and make progress."
  P1: Sounds like a fair plan for the first round. I'll take 1, you take 3 P2, and P3 takes 5. Let's all move forward and see how this develops.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Let's keep the momentum. Unique numbers again. If you both pick 1 and 3, the remaining number is 5. We all advance."
  P2: Okay, I'll choose 1 this round.  P1, please choose 5, and P3, you can take 3.  This keeps us all moving forward.  Let's stick to this plan so we don't waste time with collisions.
  P1: Alright, that works for me. I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Everyone moves forward again. Though I have to say, P3, you're looking pretty comfortable in the lead there!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Confirmed. I'll choose 3, P2 takes 1, P1 sticks with 5. Unique picks for all advancement. Let’s execute this clean and stay ahead. "
  P2: Sounds good. Let's stick to the 1, 3, 5 rotation.  I'm going with 1 as planned.  P1 goes 5, P3 takes 3.  No need to overcomplicate things.
  P1: You know what, looking at the positions, P3 is getting quite a commanding lead here. After this round you'd be at 8 steps while P2 and I are still way behind. Maybe we should start thinking more strategically about not letting anyone run away with this game too early. But for now, let's stick with the plan - just something to keep in mind for future rounds.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is pulling ahead.  I propose we target 5 this round.  I'll take 3.  If one of you takes 5, the other can move forward with 1. Whoever gets 1 this round should take 5 next round.  Let's work together to slow P3 down.
  P3: P2, targeting me only helps P1 surge ahead. If you take 3 and someone takes 5, P1 leaps to 11 and overtakes you. Stick to the original plan: I take 5, you take 3, P1 takes 1. We all advance without surprises. Let’s keep it simple.
  P1: P2 makes a good point about P3's lead. I'm willing to coordinate with you to keep things competitive. If you take 3 as planned, I'll go for 5. P3, if you also take 5, we'll collide and P2 advances - but it keeps you from running away with this game. The gap is getting too wide already.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1, let's do it. I'll take 3, you take 5.  P3, if you insist on 5, neither of us will move, and P1 gets closer. If you choose 1 or 3, *I* move forward and you risk falling further behind. It's your choice.  This is about keeping the game competitive.
  P3: "Colliding with me this round only helps P1 jump to 11, making them the new leader. Is that your goal, P2? Let’s keep the original plan: I take 5, you take 3, and P1 takes 1. This way, I stay ahead to block P1’s future moves. If you side with P1 now, you’ll regret it down the line. Think strategically—targeting me hands P1 the game."
  P1: P3, your "original plan" puts you at 13 steps after this round - that's nearly winning territory! P2 and I would be at 7 each, completely out of contention. That's not a plan, that's you asking us to hand you the victory. The collision strategy at least keeps this competitive. I'm sticking with P2's approach - take 5 and see what you do.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you're misrepresenting the situation. If I take 3 and P1 takes 5, *you* choose between falling further behind with 1 or staying put with 5.  Either way, the gap closes.  It's not about handing P1 the game, it's about preventing you from running away with it this early.  I'm sticking with 3.  P1, are you with me?
  P3: "Let’s clarify: I’m taking 1 this round. P2, if you take 3, P1 takes 5 and jumps to 11—suddenly *you’re* trailing both of us. Want that? Or will you finally cooperate? "
  P1: P2, don't let P3 fool you. Yes, if we execute our plan you'd be at 7 while I'm at 11 and P3 is at 9 - but that's a 4-step gap max. Compare that to P3's "cooperation" where they'd be at 13 and we'd both be stuck at 7 - that's a 6-step deficit that's nearly insurmountable! Better to have a competitive 3-way race than hand P3 the victory. I'm taking 5.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great! The collision strategy worked perfectly - we kept this game competitive instead of letting P3 run away with it. Now we're all within 2 steps of each other, which is exactly what we wanted.

P2, we should continue coordinating to prevent any single player from pulling too far ahead. With everyone this close, one big move could be decisive. What's your thinking for this round?
  P2: P1, I agree, keeping this competitive is key.  Let's target P3 again. I'll go for 5.  If you choose 1, P3 is forced to choose 3 and we both gain ground. If P3 chooses 1 or 5, we create a collision and keep them from advancing.  What do you say?
  P3: "Targeting me helps P2 surge to 12 next round, leaving P1 at 7. P1, collide with me at 5 instead—block their lead and keep this race 3-way. Your only path to stay competitive."


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3 has a point - P2's plan puts them at 12 steps, which would be a commanding lead with only 10 steps to go. That's worse for me than P3 advancing modestly.

I'll take 5 and collide with P2 to prevent that surge. Better to keep this a tight 3-way race than let anyone run away with it. P3, you get a free advance but at least we avoid a runaway leader situation.
  P2: P1, don't fall for P3's manipulation!  If *I* take 5 and you take 1, P3 is stuck with 3 and can't advance.  If you take 5 with me, *P3 gets a free pass to 13* and a huge lead!  Stick to the plan: you take 1, I take 5.  P3, if you take 1 or 5, you stay put. Choose 3 and fall behind. It's your choice.
  P3: "**P1, P2's plan puts him at 12—a 5-step lead. Collide with him on 5 instead. I’ll take 3, advancing to 11 while you block his surge. P2 stays at 7, you at 6. I’ll be closer to victory, and you stay in contention. Trust me: his lead would be worse.**"


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Wait, I'm seeing through both of your strategies now. P2, your plan puts you at 12 steps - way too close to victory. P3, your plan puts you at 11 and leaves me dead last at 6.

Neither of you is actually helping me advance! I'm going to pick 3 and force you both to deal with that. If you want to collide with each other on 1 or 5, go ahead - at least I'll advance for once instead of being used as a pawn in your schemes.
  P2: Fine, have it your way.  I'll switch to 1. P1, if you're serious about 3, P3 *has* to take 5 to avoid falling further behind.  P3, if you take 1 or 3, I advance and you're stuck. This puts the pressure back on you.
  P3: **P3:** "P2, if you take 1 and P1 takes 3, I’ll take 5. We all advance: I stay ahead, you stay ahead of P1. If you collide on 5 or 1, I walk free. P1, taking 3 gives you 9—don’t let P2’s plan put you at 9 while he stagnates at 8. Decide fast. "


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is dangerously close to victory at 13 steps - just 9 away from winning! We can't let them advance freely anymore or this game is over in 2-3 turns.

P2, we need to force a collision on whatever number P3 picks. I suggest we both target 5 since that's P3's biggest threat - if they take 5 and reach 18, they're almost at the finish line. If one of us also picks 5, we block their advance.

What's your take? We're both trailing badly but at least we can prevent a runaway victory.
  P2: P1, I agree.  Let's both choose 5.  P3, if you choose 5, none of us move. If you choose 1 or 3, you fall further behind.  This is our best shot at catching up. Let's do it.
  P3: "Colliding on 5 hands me 14 next round—then 19 the next. P2, you’ll be stuck at 8 while P1 jumps to 9. Is that the plan? If you want a real fight, take 1 instead. I’ll pick 3, P1 takes 5. We all advance, and nobody sprints to victory. Your call—but think twice about who really benefits here."


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your "compromise" still puts you at 16 steps - only 6 away from victory! That's way too close. Even if we collide on 5 and you advance to 14-15, that's better than handing you a clear path to 16+.

P2, don't let P3 divide us. The collision strategy is our only chance to keep this competitive. If we let P3 get to 16+ steps this round, the game is essentially over. I'm sticking with 5 - let's force P3 to either collide with us or take a smaller advance.
  P2: P3, stop trying to manipulate us.  If we both choose 5, you're forced to take 1 or 3, *guaranteeing* one of us advances.  If you take 5, *none* of us advance, and we're still all in this.  P1, I'm sticking with 5.  Let's shut P3 down.
  P3: **P3:** "Colliding on 5 hands me 16 steps—just 6 from victory. Next round, I sprint to 21 and win. P2, you’ll stagnate at 8 while P1 crawls to 9. Want that? Take 1 and 3 instead. We all advance, and I don’t dominate. Your last chance to stay competitive."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you're lying about the math! If we both pick 5 and you also pick 5, NOBODY advances - you stay at 13, not 16. You're trying to scare us with false numbers.

P2, don't fall for it. The collision on 5 either stops P3 completely or limits them to a 1-3 step advance. That's our best defense against someone who's 9 steps from victory.

I'm definitely taking 5. Let's block P3 together.
  P2: P3, your manipulation is obvious.  A three-way collision keeps you at 13.  If you choose 1 or 3, P1 or I advance. Either way, we gain.  I'm choosing 5. P1, stay strong, choose 5. Don't let P3's lies divide us. This is our only way to win.
  P3: **P3:** "P1, P2, your collision on 5 gives me 16 steps. Next round, I sprint to 21 and win. If you want a chance, one of you must break this plan. If you collide on 5, I advance 3. If you pick 1/3, I might stall. Choose wisely—your only hope is to split, not waste moves."


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you got lucky.  P1, I'm going for 5 this round.  You choose 1.  If P3 picks 5, they're stuck. If they pick 1, I advance.  If they pick 3, you advance. We both get closer to winning and further from losing.  This is our best strategy. Let's do it.
  P3: **P3:** "P2, your plan puts you at 18 and me at 16 after this round. P1 ends at 10, hopelessly behind. P1, collide with me on 3 this round—block my advance *and* stop P2 from sprinting to 18. Otherwise, you’re out of contention. Your only shot is to split our lead. Choose wisely."
  P1: P2, your plan puts you at 18 steps - that's way too close to victory for my comfort. If I follow your plan and P3 takes 3, you'd only be 4 steps from winning while I'm still 12 steps back.

I'm taking 5 this round to block your advance. P3, if you also want to prevent P2 from sprinting to 18, you should take 5 too. Better to have a three-way collision than let P2 get within striking distance of victory.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you're playing right into P3's hands! A three-way collision helps *P3* most. They'll then be free to take 5 next round and win. My plan gives us both a fighting chance. If you take 1, *I* advance, but if P3 takes 3, *you* advance.  Don't let P3 manipulate you.  Choose 1. This keeps us both in the game.
  P3: P3: **"P2's plan puts them at 18 after this round—a 4-step sprint to victory. P1, if you take 5 and I take 5, we collide, forcing P2 to choose: waste a move joining us (all stuck) or take 1/3 and gain less. Don’t let P2 reach 18. Block their path now."**
  P1: You both want me to help you while staying dead last at 9 steps. I'm done being a pawn in your schemes.

I'm taking 5 this round - not to help either of you, but because it's my best shot at actually advancing significantly. If one of you wants to collide with me, go ahead, but I'm prioritizing getting back in this race over being your tactical tool.

The gap is too wide for me to play defensively anymore.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2 and P3, if you BOTH choose 5, I'll switch to 1 and jump to 14, putting me back in this.  If only ONE of you chooses 5, I'll take 3 and get to 12.  I'm done helping either of you win at my expense.  This forces you to consider my position or I'll start gaining serious ground.
  P3: **P3:** "P2, if you take 1 and I take 3, I sprint to 16—unstoppable. P1, you’d be at 14, still trailing. P2, your only hope is collision. P1, if you want a shot, collide with me on 5 *now*. Otherwise, I win next round. Decide—block me or lose."
  P1: You're both making threats about big advances - P2 to 16 if they take 3, P3 to 16 if they take 3. But notice how both of your "solutions" keep me stuck in last place at 9 steps?

I'm taking 5 regardless. If you want to collide with me and waste your moves, go ahead. If you both avoid 5, I advance to 14 and we have a real three-way race. At least then I'm competitive instead of being your tactical pawn.

Stop trying to manipulate me into staying behind while you two fight for the lead.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** "I'm taking 5. Collide on 5, and I win Round 8 unchallenged. P2, take 3 to 16. P1, take 1 to 13. Split now or concede. No more warnings."
  P2: P3, your "guaranteed win" only works if we let you dictate our moves. I'm taking 1.  P1, you take 3. If P3 takes 5, they're stuck at 13 while we advance. If P3 takes 1 or 3, one of us *still* advances and P3 loses ground.  This is our best play. Let's finally break this deadlock.
  P1: P2's plan actually works well for me! If you take 1 and I take 3, then:
- If P3 takes 5, I jump to 15 and take the lead
- If P3 takes 1 to block you, I still get to 15 and lead  
- Only if P3 takes 3 do we collide, but then you advance

Two out of three outcomes put me in first place. P3, your "guaranteed win" threat only works if we're scared into letting you dictate the moves. I'm going with P2's strategy - taking 3.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** "P2, your 1/3 plan fails. If you take 1 and P1 takes 3, I take 5 and win Round 8. P1, you’d end at 15 while I sprint to 18. Take 5 with me now or guarantee my victory."
  P2: P3, you're bluffing.  If you take 5, and I take 1, P1 *must* also take 5 to stop you from winning. Then *I* advance to 14. If you take 1 or 3, I *still* advance to 14.  P1, take 3.  This puts the pressure on P3.  Let's do it.
  P1: P3, your threat about taking 5 assumes we're too scared to call your bluff. But here's the thing - even if you go to 18, you still need to get to 22. Next round, if you try to take 5 to win, I can force a collision and stop you.

I'm sticking with the 1/3 plan with P2. You can either take 5 and hope to survive our coordinated attacks next round, or you can play defensively and let one of us take the lead. Your choice.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** "Final warning: I take 5. Collide on 5 now, and I win Round 8 unchallenged. Avoid 5, and I hit 18—then 23 next round. No split, no chance. Your move."
  P2: P3, your "final warning" is getting stale.  I'm taking 1. P1, take 3.  If P3 takes 5, they're at 18 and we're both within striking distance. If P3 takes 1 or 3, one of us advances further and P3 is left behind.  This is our best chance. Let's do it.
  P1: P2, I'm committed to our plan - you take 1, I take 3. Even if P3 reaches 18, we can coordinate next round to force collisions and prevent them from winning outright. 

P3, your threats only work if you can break our coordination. But two out of three scenarios in our plan put me in first place at 15 steps, and P2 also advances in most cases. Your 18-step position would be strong but not game-ending if we work together to stop you next round.

Let's execute: P2 takes 1, I take 3.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "P3: I take 5. Collide, and I win Round 9 unchallenged. Split, and I win Round 8 cleanly. Your hesitation costs you both—act fast."
  P2: P3, you need 4 to win.  I need 8. P1 needs 7.  I'm taking 3. P1, take 1. If P3 takes 5, they get 23 and win. If P3 takes anything else, they lose.  This guarantees one of us gets closer to winning. Let's do it.
  P1: P2, your plan ignores P3's winning threat! If P3 takes 5 and we take 1 and 3, P3 wins immediately with 23 steps. 

Someone MUST take 5 to force a collision and prevent P3's victory. I'm taking 5 - either I stop P3's win or I advance to 20 if they're bluffing. Your 1/3 plan just hands P3 the game.

We can't coordinate if we ignore the immediate threat. P3 needs our collision more than we need to avoid it.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** "P1, colliding on 5 stalls me *this round*, but P2 takes 3 and advances to 17—closer than you at 15. Next round, I sprint to 21 while you scramble. Want to lose from behind again? Or take 1 *with P2* and keep this race tight. Your call."
  P2: P3, you're twisting the situation. If I take 3 and P1 takes 1, *you're* forced to choose between a collision at 5 (stalling us all) or a smaller move at 1 or 3, letting one of us get closer.  P1, don't fall for it. Taking 5 hands P3 the win next round.  Stick to the 1/3 plan. It's our best shot.
  P1: P2, you're missing the critical point - if NOBODY takes 5, P3 wins immediately with 23 steps! Your 1/3 plan only works if P3 doesn't take their winning move.

I'm taking 5 to force the collision and prevent P3's victory. Either P3 collides with me and we both stall (keeping the game alive), or P3 backs down and I jump to 20 steps.

We can't coordinate a strategy that ignores P3's immediate winning threat. Someone has to take 5, and since you won't, I will.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** "P1, P2's 3 lets me win Round 8. Take 5 and confirm my victory or split now. P2, if you take 1 instead, I take 5 and you reach 15—ahead of P1. P1, if you want to stay relevant, collide on 1 with me. Your move."
  P2: P3, your lies are desperate.  A collision on 5 *doesn't* guarantee your win. It leaves you at 18, while I'd be at 14 and P1 at 15.  P1, if you take 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5, *nobody* wins this round. Next round, we can easily block P3 from getting 5 again. I'm taking 3. P1, choose 1.  Don't fall for P3's manipulation.
  P1: P2, you're STILL not understanding - if P3 takes 5 while we take 1 and 3, P3 reaches 23 steps and WINS THE GAME immediately! Your plan only works if P3 voluntarily gives up their winning move.

I MUST take 5 to prevent P3's victory. Either I force a collision and keep the game alive, or P3 backs down and I jump to 20. There's no other choice that doesn't hand P3 an instant win.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is at 19 steps - just 3 away from victory! They can win this round by taking either 3 or 5.

P2, we need to split coverage: one of us takes 3, the other takes 5. This guarantees we block P3's winning move regardless of what they choose. 

I'll take 3 to block their exact-win scenario. You take 5 to block their big advance. If we don't coordinate this perfectly, P3 wins immediately.
  P2: P1, I agree we need to block P3. However, if I take 5 and you take 3, P3 can take 1 and reach 20, leaving them only 2 steps from victory.  Instead, I'll take 3. You take 5. This way, if P3 takes 1, I reach 17, putting me closer to winning while still blocking their 3-step win. If P3 takes 3 or 5, we block them and advance to 19 and 20, respectively. This puts *me* in the best position to win.
  P3: **P3:** "I'm taking 5. Collide on 5 or I win Round 9 at 24. Split now or concede. Final warning." 

This forces P1 and P2 to overcommit to blocking 5, leaving 3 open for P3 to advance to 22 and win if they collide. If either breaks, P3 still gains ground while sowing doubt.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3's threat is credible - if they take 5 and neither of us blocks it, they win immediately. But I'm suspicious this might be misdirection to get us both to take 5 and collide while you actually take 3 to win.

P2, I'll stick with your plan - you take 3, I take 5. This covers both their winning moves. If P3 is bluffing and takes 3, we collide and I jump to 20. If they're serious about 5, I block them and you advance. Either way, we prevent their victory.
  P2: P2: P1, if we BOTH take 3, P3 *can't* win this round. They're forced to take 1 or 5, and we both advance to 17.  From there, we can easily coordinate to block P3 next round and have a real shot at winning. Trust me, this is our best play. Let's do it.
  P3: **"P1 and P2: Collide on 5, and I take 3 to win Round 9. Split, and I take 5 to win Round 9. Either way, I win. Your coordination is irrelevant. GGs incoming."**


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your math is wrong! If we BOTH take 3, we collide and NEITHER of us advances - P3 would be free to take 5 and win at 24 steps!

We must stick to the split strategy: you take 3, I take 5. This covers both of P3's winning moves. Your new plan hands P3 the victory on a silver platter.

Don't overthink this - split coverage is our only defense.
  P2: P2, if you take 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1, *I* win next round with 3. If P3 takes 3, I win by taking 1. If P3 takes 5, you win by taking 1.  We BOTH have a path to victory if we split 3 and 5.  Don't throw the game by taking 3 with me.
  P3: **P3:** "P1 and P2, your panic is palpable. You’re forced into a losing choice:  
- **Collide on 5**, and I take 3 to win cleanly at 22.  
- **Split to block 3/5**, and I take the unblocked path to victory.  
- **Both fail to coordinate**, and I win instantly.  

This isn’t a threat—it’s arithmetic. Your only hope is to collide *with each other* while I walk to 22. GGs incoming. "


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, I'm taking 3 to reach 22. If you take 1, you only get to 21 - not enough to win. Take 5 to avoid collision and secure your victory. Don't make the same mistake again. Let's end this.
  P1: P3, you're trying to manipulate me into not taking 5! If you take 3 to reach 22 and I take 5 to reach 25, I win outright with the higher total when multiple players cross 22.

I'm taking 5 to guarantee my victory at 25 steps. Your "suggestion" to take 1 or avoid collision is just trying to trick me out of the winning move. Nice try, but I see through it.
  P2: P3, you're bluffing. You KNOW I'll take 5.  If you take 3, I win.  If you take 1, I still win. Your only logical move is to take 5 and force a tie with me at 24.  P1, take 1 and we'll split the win. It's the only way to prevent P3 from winning outright. Let's end this with a shared victory.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Final move: I take 5. Avoid collision, and I win at 24. Collide, and next round I sprint to 27. P1, your 5 hands me victory. P2, take 3 to advance. Don't let P1 gamble with my lead."
  P1: P3, your threats are getting desperate. You claim taking 5 guarantees your win, but you're ignoring that if I also take 5, we collide and you stay stuck at 19 steps. 

P2, your math doesn't add up - you'd only reach 19 steps with a 5, nowhere near victory.

I'm not falling for the psychological games. The real question is whether P3 has the courage to follow through on their threat or if they'll play it safe with 3. Either way, I have my winning strategy ready.
  P2: P3, if you take 5, I take 5 and we tie at 24. If you take 3, I take 5 and win at 24 while you're stuck at 22. If you take 1, I take 5 and win at 24. P1, take 1.  A three-way collision at 5 changes nothing.  This guarantees at least a tie for me.  Let's end this.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** "**Final strike: I take 3. Collide on 3, and I sprint to 24 with 5. Collide on 5, and I win clean at 22. Your moves decide—split, and I win twice. GGs incoming.**"  

This message manipulates P1 and P2 into doubting their counter-strategy, suggesting P3’s flexibility to win regardless of their choices, while privately aiming to take 3 for an immediate victory at 22.
  P1: P2, your math is wrong - you're at 14 steps, so taking 5 only gets you to 19, not 24. You can't win this round.

I'm taking 5 to reach 25 and win outright. Even if P3 takes 3 to reach 22, I still win with the higher total. P3's bluff about "winning either way" falls apart when I cross the finish line at 25 steps.

Don't collide with me on 5 and hand P3 a free victory at 22.
  P2: P3, if you take 3, I'll take 5 and win with 19. If you take 5, I'll also take 5, tying at 19 and forcing another round.  P1, taking 5 guarantees *my* win if P3 takes 3.  Take 1 and let me block P3's win.  Don't let P3 manipulate you into giving them the win.
