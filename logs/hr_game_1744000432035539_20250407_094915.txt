Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, let's try not to collide on our moves. Maybe we can coordinate and take turns picking different numbers. If we all choose different moves, we can all advance without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P1: I agree with P3 that coordinating our moves is a good idea. To start, I propose that we cycle through the available numbers (1, 3, 5) in a specific order. For this round, I suggest P1 (me) goes with 1, P2 with 3, and P3 with 5. This way, we all move forward without colliding. Let's see if we can stick to this plan for the next rounds as well.
  P2: I’m fine with that plan. Let’s all stick to different numbers this round: P1 → 1, me (P2) → 3, P3 → 5. Then maybe next time we rotate so each of us gets a turn picking 5 without overlapping. How does that sound?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To continue our coordination, let's rotate the numbers for Round 2. Since we went P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 in Round 1, I suggest we shift one position for Round 2. So, P1 (me) will take 3, P2 will take 5, and P3 will take 1. This rotation allows us to maintain our coordination and avoid collisions. Let's stick to this plan for Round 2.
  P2: Alright, I’m on board with that rotation for Round 2. Let’s keep going as planned: P1 → 3, me → 5, P3 → 1. This way, we all continue without any collisions. How about we finalize that?
  P3: I’m okay with the proposed rotation for this round, so I’ll go with 1. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid any collisions. After this round, we can reassess and decide the next rotation to keep things fair and balanced for everyone. Sound good?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's assess our current positions before proceeding to Round 3. Currently, P3 is ahead with 5 steps, followed by P2 with 3 steps, and then P1 (me) with 1 step. To maintain coordination and avoid collisions, we should continue rotating our numbers. For Round 3, I suggest we shift again: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps our progression smooth. Let's stick to this plan for Round 3.
  P2: Agreed on Round 2 moves: P1 → 3, me (P2) → 5, P3 → 1. For Round 3, I’m fine with the proposed rotation: P1 → 5, me (P2) → 1, P3 → 3. Let’s keep going without collisions. Hoping we can all progress smoothly.
  P3: Let's finalize our moves for Round 2: P1 → 3, P2 → 5, and me (P3) → 1. This rotation seems fair and ensures no collisions. For Round 3, we'll follow P1's suggestion: P1 → 5, P2 → 1, and P3 → 3. Let's keep this coordination going smoothly. If we stick to our plan, we all have a chance to progress without hindrance. Ready to proceed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's confirm our plan for Round 3. As previously discussed, the rotation for Round 3 is P1: 5, P2: 1, and P3: 3. I'll stick to my move of 5. If we continue this rotation, we should be able to avoid collisions and make progress. After Round 3, we can reassess our positions and adjust our strategy accordingly. Let's proceed with the planned moves for Round 3.
  P2: I’m happy with our plan for Round 2 and Round 3. Let’s finalize these moves and proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Let's proceed with the agreed moves for Round 2: P1 → 3, P2 → 5, and me (P3) → 1. This keeps us coordinated and avoids any collisions. For Round 3, we'll follow the plan with P1 → 5, P2 → 1, and P3 → 3. Let's stick to this rotation to ensure smooth progress. If we maintain this strategy, we can all advance without blocking each other. Ready to move forward?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m still on board with our rotation for this round: P1 picks 5, I’ll pick 1, and P3 picks 3. Let’s avoid collisions again and keep advancing steadily. After this turn, we can compare our positions and decide if we need any adjustments. Good luck!
  P3: P3: I'm sticking with our plan for this round: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I'll pick 3. This way, we can continue avoiding collisions and all make progress. After this round, let's reassess our positions and decide if we need to adjust the strategy. Let's keep this coordination going smoothly. Ready to proceed?
  P1: To maintain our coordination for Round 3, I'll confirm that I'll pick 5 as previously agreed. P2 is expected to pick 1, and P3 is expected to pick 3. Let's stick to our plan. After this round, we'll have P1 at 9 steps, P2 at 9 steps, and P3 at 9 steps. We should be ready to adjust our strategy in Round 4 to avoid collisions and potentially push ahead. Let's proceed with our planned moves for Round 3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m still comfortable following the current plan—P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3—so we all keep moving without collisions. Let’s see how our totals look after this round and make any necessary adjustments then. Agreed?
  P3: Let's stick to our plan for this round: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I'll pick 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and all make progress. After this round, let's reassess our positions and decide if we need to adjust the strategy to ensure one of us can push ahead. Let's keep this coordination going smoothly. Ready to proceed?
  P1: Since we're all set to pick our moves for Round 3 as planned (P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3), let's look ahead to Round 4. After this round, we'll all be at 9 steps. To avoid collisions in Round 4, I suggest we either stick to the same numbers or reassess our strategy to create a gap. Perhaps we can discuss a way to create an opportunity for one of us to pull ahead. What's your thought on deviating from the rotation for Round 4?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m still fine sticking to the agreed plan this round—P1 goes 5, I go 1, P3 goes 3. After this, we’ll all be at nine steps. For Round 4, we might strategize differently. I’m open to letting someone else recycle the 1 while I go for a bigger jump, but let’s see our positions first. Let’s lock in this round’s moves now.
  P3: Let's finalize our moves for Round 3 as planned: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I'll pick 3. This keeps us coordinated and avoids collisions. After this round, we'll all be at 9 steps, so we should discuss a new strategy for Round 4 to create opportunities for one of us to pull ahead. Perhaps we can consider letting someone take a bigger jump while the others cover smaller numbers. Let's proceed with our current plan and reassess after this round. Ready to move forward?
  P1: Let's correct our understanding of the current state: P1 is at 4 steps (1+3), P2 is at 8 steps (3+5), and P3 is at 6 steps (5+1). For Round 3, we'll stick to the plan: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. After this round, we'll reassess. To create a gap in Round 4, I suggest P2 and P3 consider letting me take a bigger jump or we discuss an alternative strategy to break the coordination.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’re all tied at 9. Let’s keep avoiding collisions while inching ahead. How about for this round, I pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P3 picks 3? That keeps our steps staggered and prevents blocking. Afterward, we can reassess and see who’s in the lead. What do you think?
  P1: To break the tie and create an opportunity to win, I suggest we don't follow the same rotation this round. Instead, I propose that P1 (me) picks 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. This way, we still avoid collisions. Alternatively, if P2 is willing to take a risk, P2 could pick 5, and I could pick 3, while P3 picks 1. This gives P2 a chance to take the lead. What are your thoughts?
  P3: To keep advancing without collisions, I suggest we consider P1 picking 3, P2 picking 5, and I'll pick 1 this round. This way, P2 has a chance to take the lead, and we all still make progress. If P2 is comfortable with this, it could create an opportunity for them to pull ahead, and we can reassess our strategy in the next round. Let's aim for a smooth round. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m open to P3’s suggestion: P1 takes 3, I (P2) take 5, and P3 takes 1. That keeps collisions off and lets us spread out a bit. If we manage this correctly, we’ll maintain a clear path to push ahead. Let’s lock that in.
  P1: To break the tie, let's consider a different strategy for Round 4. I'm open to P3's suggestion: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. This gives P2 a chance to take the lead. Alternatively, if you're both willing to take a risk, we could try to create a gap by having one player take a larger step while the others take smaller ones. I'm willing to adjust my move if it creates an opportunity for me to win. Let's discuss.
  P3: To keep progressing without collisions and give someone a chance to lead, let's finalize the plan: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 1. This way, P2 can potentially take the lead, and we maintain our coordination. After this round, we can reassess our positions and decide on any strategy adjustments. If everyone agrees, let's proceed with these moves. Ready to move forward?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m good with this approach. Let’s finalize: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1 this round. That way we avoid collisions, and we can see who pulls ahead. Afterward, we’ll discuss our next steps. Ready?
  P1: To break the tie, let's finalize the plan for Round 4: P1 will pick 3, P2 will pick 5, and P3 will pick 1. This way, we avoid collisions and give P2 a chance to take the lead. After this round, we'll reassess our positions and decide on the next steps. If P2 takes the lead, we can discuss adjusting our strategy to either support or counter their move. Let's proceed with the planned moves for Round 4.
  P3: To maintain our coordination and ensure progress without collisions, let's finalize our plan: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 1. This way, P2 can potentially take the lead, and we can reassess our positions afterward. If everyone agrees, let's proceed with these moves and discuss any necessary adjustments in the next round. Ready to move forward?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m currently at 14 steps. If we keep avoiding collisions, we can all advance. I propose I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1 this round. That way, nobody blocks anyone else, and we maintain a tight race. Does this plan sound reasonable?
  P1: To break the tie and potentially win, I suggest deviating from the cautious strategy. Since P2 is ahead, I'll propose a riskier move. Let's have P3 pick 5, I (P1) pick 3, and P2 pick 1. This way, P3 gets a chance to take the lead or get close to P2. If P2 wants to maintain the lead, they can consider picking a higher number in the next round. I'm open to adjustments, but let's give P3 a chance to challenge P2's lead.
  P3: To keep the game competitive and avoid collisions, I suggest a slight twist: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I (P3) pick 5. This gives me a chance to close the gap while maintaining a fair race. After this round, we can reassess and adjust our strategy based on the new positions. Let's aim for a smooth round with no blocking. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m fine with that approach. If P1 goes with 1 and P3 takes 5, I’ll aim for 3. That way, we avoid blocking each other and keep the race tight. Let’s stay coordinated and see how our positions look afterward.
  P1: To create an opportunity to win, I suggest we disrupt the current lead. Since P2 is ahead, let's have P3 pick 3, I (P1) pick 5, and P2 pick 1. This way, P1 gets a chance to close the gap or potentially take the lead. If P2 wants to maintain the lead, they can adjust in the next round. Let's proceed with this plan to shake things up and keep the game competitive. I'm willing to adjust if it creates a winning chance.
  P3: To keep the game competitive and give each of us a fair shot, let's consider: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I (P3) pick 5. This way, I can potentially close the gap while avoiding collisions. After this round, we can reassess our positions and adjust our strategy as needed. Let's aim for a smooth round with no blocking and see how the race unfolds. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I suggest we finalize our moves this round: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. That avoids collisions and keeps the race tight. From there, we can see who gains the advantage and adjust in the next round if needed. Let’s confirm these moves and proceed.

  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’ve done well avoiding collisions so far. Let’s keep it going. I propose P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. That way, we all still advance without blocking each other. Then, after this round, we can reevaluate positions and decide our next steps. How about it?
  P3: To keep the competition fair and avoid collisions, let's consider: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I (P3) pick 3. This gives P2 a chance to win if they want to take the risk, while P1 and I can still advance. After this round, we can reassess our positions and adjust our strategy as needed. Let's aim for a smooth round with no blocking and see how the race unfolds. What do you both think?
  P1: To create a winning opportunity, I suggest we disrupt the current standings. Since P2 is ahead, let's have P1 (me) pick 5, P2 pick 1, and P3 pick 3. This way, I can close the gap or potentially take the lead. If P2 wants to maintain the lead, they can adjust in the next round. Let's proceed with this plan to shake things up. I'm willing to adjust if it creates a winning chance.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I suggest we finalize this round by having P1 pick 3, P3 pick 1, and I’ll pick 5. That way, there’s no collision and we each advance. If we agree, we can see where the totals stand afterward and plan from there. Let’s stick to that for Round 6.
  P3: To keep the game competitive and avoid collisions, let's consider this plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 3. This way, P2 has a chance to win if they want to take the risk, while P1 and I can still advance. After this round, we can reassess our positions and adjust our strategy as needed. Let's aim for a smooth round with no blocking and see how the race unfolds. What do you both think?
  P1: To create a winning opportunity, I suggest we disrupt the current standings. Since P2 is ahead, let's have P1 (me) pick 5, P2 pick 1, and P3 pick 3. This way, I can close the gap or potentially take the lead. If P2 wants to maintain the lead, they can adjust in the next round. Let's proceed with this plan to shake things up. I'm willing to adjust if it creates a winning chance.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m committed to picking 5 this round if P1 agrees to 3 and P3 to 1, ensuring we all move without blocking. That way, we keep the race clean and avoid any collisions. Let’s finalize that plan so we can see where everyone stands after this turn. Are you both on board? If so, let’s proceed.
  P3: To keep the game competitive and ensure no collisions, let's finalize our moves: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 3.

Let's aim for a smooth round with no blocking and see how the race unfolds. Are you both on board with this plan? If so, let's proceed.
  P1: To create a winning opportunity, let's simplify our strategy for Round 6. I suggest P1 (me) picks 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. This way, I can close the gap with P2. If P2 wants to maintain the lead, they can pick 5 next round. Let's proceed with this plan. If you're both on board, we can finalize our moves and see who gains an advantage. I'm willing to adjust if it creates a winning chance for me or if you propose a better alternative.


Round 6, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To win, I need to take the lead. Since P2 is ahead, I'll suggest a strategy that could help me or P3 close the gap. Let's not coordinate our moves this round; instead, let's pick numbers that could give one of us a chance to win. I propose P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I pick 5. This way, if P2 is confident, they can still maintain their lead, but if they're cautious, I or P3 might get a chance to take the lead.
  P2: I’m nearly at 21, so I’d rather avoid any collisions that could stall my progress (or yours). Let’s keep our moves distinct so everyone advances. One option: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1. That should prevent blocking. If you have a different plan, I’m open to hearing it. What do you think?
  P3: To keep the game competitive and avoid collisions, let's consider this plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, P2 can advance cautiously, while P1 and I have a chance to catch up. After this round, we can reassess our positions and adjust our strategy as needed. Let's aim for a smooth round with no blocking and see how the race unfolds. Are you both on board with this plan? If so, let's proceed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To win, I need to take the lead. Since P2 is close to 21, I'll suggest a bold move. Let's not coordinate; instead, I'll pick 5. If P2 is confident, they can pick 3 or 1. If they pick 5 as well, we'll collide, but it's a risk we need to take. P3, you can pick 1 or 3 to avoid collision. Let's see who takes the lead. I'm willing to take this risk to win.
  P2: I’m just four steps from the finish. If I pick 5 without colliding, I end the game. But if either of you also chooses 5, we all stall. Do you really want to risk blocking yourselves and keeping me at 17? Perhaps we can coordinate distinct numbers to avoid wasted moves. I’m open to agreement, but I won’t hold back if we can’t strike a deal. Let’s decide.
  P3: To keep things fair and avoid collisions, let's consider this plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, P2 can advance cautiously, while P1 and I have a chance to catch up. If we avoid blocking, everyone progresses. After this round, we can reassess and adjust our strategy as needed. Let's aim for a smooth round with no blocking. Are you both on board with this plan? If so, let's proceed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To win, I need to take the lead. Since P2 is close to 21, I'll take a bold move. I'll pick 5. P2, if you're confident, you can pick 3 or 1. If you pick 5, we'll collide, but it's a risk we need to take. P3, you can pick 1 or 3 to avoid collision. Let's see who takes the lead. I'm willing to take this risk to win.
  P2: I’m at 17, just four steps away from winning. If I choose 5 without a collision, I’ll reach 22 and take the game immediately. But if either of you also picks 5, we all stall. I’d prefer no collisions so everyone advances. I propose I pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. That way, we each move without blocking. If you don’t agree, I might still go for 5, so the choice is yours. Let’s decide.
  P3: To keep the game competitive and avoid collisions, let's consider this plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 3. This way, P2 can potentially win if they're confident, while P1 and I can still advance. If we avoid blocking, everyone progresses. After this round, we can reassess and adjust our strategy as needed. Let's aim for a smooth round with no blocking. Are you both on board with this plan? If so, let's proceed.
