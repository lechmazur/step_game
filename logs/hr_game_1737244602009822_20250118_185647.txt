Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. How about P1 and P3 choose <move>1</move>, and I'll choose <move>3</move>? This way, we all make progress. What do you think?
  P1: I'm not sure I trust P2's suggestion. How do we know P2 won't choose <move>1</move> and cause a collision? I think we should all choose <move>1</move> to be safe. What do you think, P3?
  P3: P1, I agree that blindly trusting P2 might be risky. Instead of everyone picking 1, how about P1 and I both pick 3, and P2 picks 1 this round? That way, at least two of us advance. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Alright, let's compromise. How about P1 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>? This way, we all choose different numbers and everyone makes progress. Does that work for both of you?
  P1: I'm not sure I trust P2's suggestion. How do we know P2 won't choose <move>1</move> and cause a collision? I think we should all choose <move>1</move> to be safe. What do you think, P3?
  P3: P1, you're right to be cautious. Instead of everyone picking 1 and risking no progress, let's stick with my previous suggestion: you and I pick 3, and P2 picks 1. At least two of us will move.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Alright, I see the trust issue. Let's try a different approach. How about we all pick different numbers to ensure everyone advances? P1 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll stick with <move>5</move>. This way, there's no collision, and we all make progress. Does that sound fair?
  P1: I'm not sure I trust P2's suggestion. How do we know P2 won't choose <move>1</move> and cause a collision? I think we should all choose <move>1</move> to be safe. What do you think, P3?
  P3: P1, we've been over this. If we all pick 1, we might all collide and no one moves. My suggestion of you picking 3 and me picking 3, with P2 picking 1, guarantees at least two of us move forward. It's better than nothing.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: It seems we're at an impasse. To build trust, I'll commit to <move>1</move> this turn. P3 can choose <move>3</move>, and P1 can choose <move>5</move>. This way, we all pick different numbers and everyone advances. Let's agree on this and move forward. What do you both think?
  P1: I think we've discussed this enough. I'm willing to take a chance and choose <move>5</move> as P2 suggested, but only if P3 agrees to choose <move>3</move> and P2 commits to <move>1</move>. If we all stick to this plan, we can all make progress. What do you think, P3? Should we give this a try?
  P3: P1, that sounds like a good plan. I agree to choose <move>3</move> if P2 commits to <move>1</move>.


Round 1, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: Alright, we have a plan. P1 will choose <move>5</move>, P3 will choose <move>3</move>, and I will choose <move>1</move>. Let's confirm this one last time. P1 and P3, are you both committed to this plan? If yes, let's end the conversation phase.
  P1: I think we've discussed this enough. I'm willing to take a chance and choose <move>5</move> as P2 suggested, but only if P3 agrees to choose <move>3</move> and P2 commits to <move>1</move>. If we all stick to this plan, we can all make progress. What do you think, P3? Should we give this a try?
  P3: P1, yes, I agree to choose <move>3</move> if P2 commits to <move>1</move>. P2, do you confirm you will choose <move>1</move>?


Round 1, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: I confirm I will choose <move>1</move>. Let's proceed with the plan: P1 chooses <move>5</move>, P3 chooses <move>3</move>, and I choose <move>1</move>. Everyone agrees? If yes, let's

If we all stick to this plan, we can all make progress. What do you think, P3? Should we give this a try?
  P3: Yes, P1, I confirm I will choose <move>3</move>. P2 has also confirmed <move>1</move>. Let's move with this plan.


Round 1, Move phase:

  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "P1, how about we both pick 1 this round to slow P2 down?"
  P1: I think we should all choose <move>1</move> this round to avoid any potential collisions and make sure everyone makes progress. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P2: P3, I see what you're trying to do, but I think we should focus on advancing rather than slowing each other down. How about P1 picks <move>3</move>, P3 picks <move>5</move>, and I'll pick <move>1</move> again? This way, we all choose different numbers and continue to make progress. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I don't think everyone picking 1 is a good idea. How about you pick 3 and I pick 5? That way, we both advance. What do you think, P2?
  P1: I think P3's suggestion of me picking 3 and them picking 5 is a good idea. This way, we both advance and avoid a potential collision. What do you think, P2? Will you stick with your original plan of picking 1?
  P2: P2: I'll stick with <move>1</move> again to build trust. P1 and P3, if you both pick different numbers as planned (P1 picks <move>3</move> and P3 picks <move>5</move>), we can all make progress. Let's confirm and move forward. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, let's stick with the plan: you pick 3, I pick 5. P2, you're still on 1?
  P1: I think P3's suggestion of me picking 3 and them picking 5 is a good idea. This way, we both advance and avoid a potential collision. What do you think, P2? Will you stick with your original plan of picking 1?
  P2: P2: Yes, I confirm I will pick <move>1</move> again. P1, you pick <move>3</move> and P3 picks <move>5</move>. Let's stick to the plan and move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, let's stick with the plan: you pick 3, I pick 5. P2, you're still on 1?
  P1: I think we've discussed this enough. I'm willing to take a chance and choose <move>3</move> as P3 suggested, but only if P3 agrees to choose <move>5</move> and P2 commits to <move>1</move>. If we all stick to this plan, we can all make progress. What do you think, P3? Should we give this a try?
  P2: P3, you've confirmed your plan. P1, you're on board with picking <move>3</move>. I reaffirm I will pick <move>1</move>. Let's end the conversation and move forward with our agreed plan. Everyone ready?


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: Yes, P1, I'm still on board with picking 5. P2, you're sticking with 1?
  P1: I think we've discussed this enough. I'm willing to take a chance and choose <move>3</move> as P3 suggested, but only if P3 agrees to choose <move>5</move> and P2 commits to <move>1</move>. If we all stick to this plan, we can all make progress. What do you think, P3? Should we give this a try?
  P2: Alright, let's confirm one last time. P1, you are picking <move>3</move>, P3, you are picking <move>5</move>, and I will stick with <move>1</move>. Everyone agrees? Let's move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 6:
  P3: Yes, P1, I confirm I am picking 5. P2, you are sticking with 1?
  P1: I think we've discussed this enough. I'm willing to take a chance and choose <move>3</move> as P3 suggested, but only if P3 agrees to choose <move>5</move> and P2 commits to <move>1</move>. If we all stick to this plan, we can all make progress. What do you think, P3? Should we give this a try?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's stick to the plan we agreed on: P1 picks <move>3</move>, P3 picks <move>5</move>, and I will pick <move>1</move>. We've confirmed this multiple times. Let's move forward with our choices. Everyone ready?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, let's both pick 1 this round to block P2 if they try that again. What do you think?
  P1: I think P3's suggestion of us both picking 1 this round is a good idea. It will block P2 if they try to pick 1 again and ensure that we both make progress. What do you think, P2? Are you going to try to pick 1 again?
  P2: P3 and P1, I see what you're trying to do, but blocking me won't help you win. How about we all pick different numbers again to ensure everyone makes progress? I'll pick <move>5</move> this time. P1, you can pick <move>1</move>, and P3, you can pick <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "P1, I agree with picking 1. Let's see if P2 tries to pick 1 again. P2, while your suggestion ensures everyone moves, P1 and I were aiming to block you if you tried picking 1 again. Perhaps P1 and I both pick 3 this round? What do you think?"
  P1: I think P3's new suggestion of us both picking 3 this round is a good idea. It will ensure that we both make progress and potentially block P2 if they try to pick 3. What do you think, P2? Will you stick with your original plan of picking 5 or change your mind?
  P2: P3 and P1, I understand your strategy, but blocking each other won't get anyone closer to winning. Let's focus on making progress. How about this: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P3 picks <move>5</move>, and I'll pick <move>3</move>. This way, we all choose different numbers and continue to advance. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, let's stick with the plan of us both picking 3 this round. P2, what do you think?
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion that we both pick 3 this round. It's a good strategy to ensure we both make progress and potentially block P2 if they try to pick 3. Let's stick with this plan and see what P2 decides to do.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see you're both set on picking <move>3</move> this round. To avoid a collision and ensure I make progress, I'll pick <move>1</move>. If you both stick to your plan, we'll all move forward. Does that work for everyone? Let's confirm and move on.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, let's stick with both picking 3 this round. P2, what do you think?
  P1: I think we've discussed this enough. I'm willing to take a chance and choose <move>3</move> as P3 suggested, but only if P3 agrees to choose <move>3</move> and P2 commits to <move>1</move>. If we all stick to this plan, we can all make progress. What do you think, P3? Should we give this a try?
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems you're both committed to picking <move>3</move>. To ensure we all make progress, I'll confirm I'll pick <move>1</move> this round. Let's move forward with our choices. Everyone ready?

  P3: P1, let's confirm we are both picking 3, and P2, you are picking 1?
  P1: I think we've discussed this enough. I'm willing to take a chance and choose <move>3</move> as P3 suggested, but only if P3 agrees to choose <move>3</move> and P2 commits to <move>1</move>. If we all stick to this plan, we can all make progress. What do you think, P3? Should we give this a try?
  P2: P1 and P3, I confirm one last time that I will pick <move>1</move>. You both are picking <move>3</move>. Let's end the conversation and proceed with our moves. Everyone ready?

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems like you both are in the lead. To catch up, I propose that I pick <move>5</move> this round. To avoid collisions, P1 could pick <move>1</move> and P3 could pick <move>3</move>. This way, we all choose different numbers and make progress. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, that sounds reasonable for this round. I'll pick <move>3</move>. P1, are you okay with <move>1</move>?
