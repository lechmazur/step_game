Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This way, we all advance. What do you think?
  P3: I appreciate the suggestion, P2, but I think we should be cautious. If we all agree to those moves, we risk colliding. How about we each choose a different number? I could take 1, P1 could take 3, and P2 could take 5. This way, we all advance without any risk of blocking each other. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, your suggestion is reasonable, but let's consider a rotating strategy instead. How about we rotate our moves each round? For example, this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Next round, we shift: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. This way, we ensure no collisions and all advance fairly. What do you think?
  P3: I see the value in a rotating strategy, P2, but I still worry about potential collisions. To ensure we all advance this round, let's finalize our moves. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5 as initially proposed. This way, we can all move forward without blocking each other. After this round, we can discuss the rotation for the next one. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:

  P3: I agree with the plan to have P1 take 1, P2 take 3, and I take 5 this round. It minimizes the risk of collisions and allows us all to advance. After this round, we can reassess our strategy for the next turn. Let's finalize our moves and ensure we all make progress!


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I'm glad we've agreed on the moves for this round. Let's stick to P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5. After we all advance, we should discuss the rotating strategy for the next round to ensure continued progress without collisions. Looking forward to a smooth first round!
  P3: I’m glad we’ve reached a consensus on our moves for this round. Just to recap, I’ll be taking 5 steps, P1 will take 1 step, and P2 will take 3 steps. This strategy ensures we all advance without colliding. After this turn, we can reevaluate our approach for the next round to keep making progress. Let’s finalize our moves and get started!
