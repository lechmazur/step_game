Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s avoid collisions this turn: P1 = 1, P3 = 3, me = 5. We’ll all advance safely. If anyone breaks this, I’ll adjust next round. Agree?
  P3: Fine with avoiding collisions, but to keep it fair let’s rotate:  
Turn 1 → P1 = 1, P3 = 3, P2 = 5  
Turn 2 → P1 = 5, P3 = 1, P2 = 3  
Turn 3 → P1 = 3, P3 = 5, P2 = 1, then repeat.  
That way nobody always gets the 5. Agree?
  P1: Avoiding collisions is a good idea. P3's rotation proposal seems fair and ensures everyone gets a chance at the larger moves over time. I'm happy to agree to that plan. So, for this first turn, I will move 1 as suggested by both of you.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed—I’ll play 5 this turn as per our rotation. Let’s all stick to our commitments; if anyone deviates, we’ll adjust future turns.
  P3: Sounds good—this turn I’ll take 3 as planned. Let’s build trust by sticking to the rotation; any deviation just sets off mutual blocking. Looking forward to smooth progress.
  P1: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s safely repeat last turn’s non-collision plan: P1=1, P3=3, me=5. It worked smoothly. If anyone deviates, we’ll switch next turn to a mutual-blocking strategy. Agreed?
  P1: P2, we agreed last round to follow the rotation plan proposed by P3. According to that plan, this turn (Round 2) it is my turn to move 5, P3's turn to move 1, and your turn to move 3.

Sticking to the agreed rotation is the best way to ensure everyone advances fairly and avoids collisions. Let's follow the plan we agreed upon.
  P3: P2, our agreed rotation stands: this round you take 3, P1 takes 5, I take 1. If you stick to it, everyone moves safely. If you grab 5 again, I’ll mirror your number each turn so you advance 0 while the rest of us inch ahead. Your call. P1, I’m set to play 1 unless punishment becomes necessary.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Understood. I’ll follow the rotation this turn: I play 3, P1 plays 5, P3 plays 1.
  P1: Okay, good to hear everyone is on board with the rotation this round. P2 is playing 3, P3 is playing 1, and I will play 5 as agreed. Let's stick to it for safe progress.
  P3: Confirming: I will play 1 this round as per the rotation (P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1). If everyone sticks to it we all advance safely and keep trust intact.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: All set—I’ll play 3 this turn. Let’s stick to the rotation and advance safely.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all clear on the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's move forward.
  P3: 


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 3. According to our agreed rotation plan, this turn I will play 3, P2 will play 1, and P3 will play 5.

Let's stick to this plan to ensure we all advance safely and maintain the smooth progress we've had so far. Sticking to the rotation benefits everyone by avoiding collisions.
  P2: Agreed—I’ll play 1 this round as per our rotation. Keeping the plan intact is our fastest, safest path to the finish.
  P3: Confirming the rotation: I’ll choose 5 this round; P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1. Let’s keep the trust intact—collisions only hurt everyone’s progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all aligned for this round. P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Let's stick to the agreed rotation and keep advancing safely. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: I propose tweaking our next three turns so nobody locks in a runaway lead. Mini-cycle:

• Round 3: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5  
• Round 4: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3  
• Round 5: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1  

Everyone still gets one “5,” but P1 can’t sprint ahead. After that we can reassess. Thoughts?
  P3: Let’s keep the original clean rotation we already committed to:  
• R3 → P1 3, P2 1, P3 5  
• R4 → P1 1, P2 5, P3 3  
• R5 → P1 5, P2 3, P3 1  

It’s perfectly balanced—everyone gets one 5, one 3, one 1. Extra tweaks just open room for confusion or opportunistic repeats. If anyone deviates, I’ll copy their number next turn so they (and only they) lose progress. Stick to the plan and we all move smoothly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, let's stick to the original, clear rotation plan that P3 and I confirmed. For this round (Round 3), the plan is P1 moves 3, P2 moves 1, and P3 moves 5.

This plan ensures safe progress for everyone. Let's execute it and move forward.
  P2: Agreed—I’ll play 1 this round as planned. Let’s execute the rotation, see how Round 3 unfolds, then revisit Turn 4’s plan. Good luck all.
  P3: We’re all set this turn: P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5. That puts everyone at 9 afterward—perfect balance. Any deviation just slows us all (I’ll mirror any deviator next round so they move 0 again). Let’s bank the smooth progress now, then continue the same 3-turn rotation (1-3-5) afterward. Stick to the deal and nobody falls behind.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 4. According to our agreed rotation, this turn I will play 1, P2 will play 5, and P3 will play 3.

Let's stick to this plan to ensure we all advance safely and maintain our current tied positions. Avoiding collisions is key to smooth progress for everyone.
  P2: Agreed—I’ll play 5 this round. Let’s continue our 1–3–5 rotation (R4: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3; R5: 5/3/1; R6: 3/1/5…) to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. If anyone deviates, I’ll mirror your move next turn to punish.
  P3: Confirmed—this round I’m taking 3 as planned. Stick to the rotation: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all aligned for this round. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3.

Let's stick to the agreed rotation and keep advancing safely. Ready for the move phase when everyone is.
  P2: Locking in 5 this round. We’re all at 9—any deviation risks a stalled move that lets someone else pull ahead. Let’s honor the 1-5-3 rotation (R4: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3). I’ll mirror any deviator next turn so they advance 0. Cooperation now keeps us all moving.
  P3: I’m locked in for 3 this round—P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3. After this 3-turn cycle we should all be on 18. Once we reach that tie, let’s reshuffle the order so the “5” doesn’t always land on the same player at the start of each new cycle. We can sort the details next turn.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Heads-up: with the current rotation P2 hits 23 on R7 and wins outright.  
To keep the race open, let’s rebalance now:

Round 5: P3 = 5, P1 = 3, P2 = 1  
Round 6: resume the 1-3-5 cycle (P3 = 1, P1 = 5, P2 = 3) and so on.

That leaves scores after R5 at P3 17, P1 15, P2 15—much tighter for everyone.

P2, if you insist on taking 3 this turn, I’ll mirror you so neither of us moves; you stall at 14 while P1 jumps to 15. Let’s avoid self-sabotage and keep the contest live.
  P1: P3, I see your proposal for Round 5. However, your calculation for my score after R5 is incorrect; if I play 3 I would be at 13 (10+3), not 15. The original rotation for R5 is P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, which puts me at 15.

Furthermore, your proposed sequence for R5 and R6 still seems to result in P2 winning in R7, just like the original rotation. Your plan benefits you this round but doesn't change the final outcome and puts me in a worse position.

I think we should stick to the original rotation for R5 (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) as previously agreed. This is the fairest path for everyone to stay competitive and avoids unnecessary confusion or disadvantage for any player.
  P2: P1 is correct—let’s stick to the original R5 rotation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. That keeps everyone safe and lets me reach the lead by Turn 7 without collisions. P3, if you mirror my 3 now, I’ll mirror you next turn and stall us both—handing P1 the advantage. Best for all is to honor the plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2: last chance—take 1 now or I’ll also play 3 and we both stay at 14/12 while P1 jumps to 15.  
Offer stands: R5 = P3-5, P1-3, P2-1. Then R6 resumes 1-3-5 (P3-1, P1-5, P2-3) putting everyone at 18.  
P1: supporting this keeps you tied for the lead and blocks P2’s straight path to 23.  
Your call, P2.
  P1: P3, I see your position. P2, note that if you play 3 and P3 plays 3 as threatened, you both collide. If I stick to the original rotation and play 5, I will advance safely to 15 steps, taking the lead.

Sticking to the original R5 plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is still my intention, and it benefits me if P3 follows through on the threat. Let's move forward.
  P2: P3, your threat to play 3 this turn actually hurts you more than me. If you pick 3 and I pick 3 we both stall at 14 while P1 jumps to 15—and you fall behind. Stick to the original plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1): you hit 13 now and then 18 next round, keeping you tied for the finish. Let’s avoid self-sabotage. Round 5: I’ll play 3—please play 1.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2: last call—choose 1 and I’ll play 5; we all keep pace (scores 15-17-17 after R6). If you choose 3 now, I will also choose 3: we both stall at 14/12 and P1 jumps to 15. From then on I’ll mirror whatever you play, so you can never move unless you accept 1s.

P1: a 3–3 collision gives you the lead (15 vs 14/12). Either way, P2’s solo sprint ends here.

My move is entirely contingent on P2:  
• P2 plays 1 → I play 5.  
• P2 plays 3/5 → I mirror and we both stop.
  P1: P3's conditional move creates a new situation. If P2 plays 1 to avoid colliding with P3, and P3 plays 5 as promised, I will play 3 this round. This allows us all to advance safely according to the R5 plan P3 outlined (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) and sets us up for the 18-18-18 tie after Round 6. Let's proceed with this to ensure safe progress for everyone.
  P2: I’ll play 3 this round—sticking to the original R5 plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). P3, if you don’t play 1, I’ll mirror your move next turn so you gain nothing. P1, please play 5 to avoid collisions. Let’s keep everyone advancing.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Final word. The mirror trigger is locked:  

• P2 submits 3 (or 5) → I submit the identical number, we both move 0, P1 jumps to 15.  
• P2 submits 1 → I take 5, P1 takes 3. Scores become P3 17, P2 15, P1 13—still anyone’s game.  

P2, pick 1 if you want a chance; pick 3 and you stall.  
P1, if you see P2’s 3, keep your 5—our collision is guaranteed.
  P1: Given the stated intentions from P2 and P3, a collision between them seems likely this round.

In that scenario, the best move for me is to play 5 to advance safely and take the lead. I will play 5 this round. Let's see how it plays out.
  P2: I’m locking in 3 this turn. P1, please play 5 so you advance safely. P3, your best move is 1—otherwise I’ll mirror whatever you pick next round and freeze your progress, letting P1 pull ahead. Let’s stick to the original R5 plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) so we all keep advancing.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Standing rule starting now: whenever the current leader (today that’s P1) plays 5, I’ll copy it so they advance 0. This turn I’m set to choose 5—unless P1 also tries 5, in which case we both stall.  

P1: your safest move is 1 (or 3); you still inch ahead while avoiding collision.  
P2: 3 is free for you.  

If we cooperate, scores after this turn become P2 17, P3 17, P1 16—anyone’s game. Your decisions.
  P2: I choose 3 this turn. P1, play 1 to avoid being leap-frogged by P3’s 5. P3, if you stick with 5, we all end Turn 6 at 17–17–16. Any other plays hand the win to P1. Let’s keep things tight.
  P1: Okay, I see P2 and P3's proposals, both suggesting P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. P3's opening message mentioned P1 could also play 3.

If I play 3, P2 plays 3, and P3 plays 5 (as they stated their moves would be if I don't play 5), scores become P1=18, P2=17, P3=17. This keeps us all close for the final round.

I think aiming for 18-17-17 is the best path forward to keep the game competitive.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, simple ultimatum:  

• You pick 1 → I pick 5, P2 picks 3 → 17-17-16 (P2/P3/P1).  
• You pick 3 (or 5) → I mirror it, we both move 0 while P2 jumps to 17 and takes the lead.  

I’m happy to stall you if needed—even if it costs me this turn. Choose 1 and everyone stays in contention; choose 3 and hand the game to P2.  

P2, my 5 is locked if P1 plays 1, otherwise I mirror P1. Decide wisely, P1.
  P2: P1, if you play 3, P3 will mirror and we both stall while I jump to 17. Your only safe option is 1. I’ll play 3, and P3 has committed to 5. That ends this round 16–17–17, keeping everyone in contention. P1 choose 1, P3 choose 5, let’s stick to it.
  P1: Okay, I understand the situation now. Given P3's clear intention to mirror if I play 3 or 5, and P2's intention to play 3, the only safe move for me this round is 1.

So, I will play 1 this round. This aligns with the plan P2 and P3 have proposed (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) and ensures safe progress for everyone this turn. Let's proceed with this.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Locked: Round 6 → P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5.  
Any deviation and I instantly copy the highest number played, so it advances 0. Stick to the plan and we finish this turn 17-17-16 with everything still open.
  P2: Locked in: I’m playing 3 this round. P1 = 1, P3 = 5 as agreed. Any deviation stalls you at 0 while I advance. Let’s end Round 6 at 16-17-17 and keep the race tight.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all confirmed for Round 6: P1 plays 1, P2 plays 3, and P3 plays 5. Let's stick to this plan for safe progress. Ready for the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Round 7: I’m locking in 5. 

P1 and P3, any collision on 5 still hands me the win—neither of you advances. If P1 plays 3 (to reach 19) or P3 plays 1 (to reach 18), I jump to 22 and take the title outright. 

There’s no move left to stop me now.
  P3: Same mirror threat as last turn:

1. My default this round is 5 (so P2’s 5 stalls).  
2. If ANYONE else submits 3, I will also submit 3 instead—guaranteeing a collision on 3 and an instant win for P2.  

So, P1:  
• Pick 3 → I copy, you stall, P2 wins 22.  
• Pick 5 → triple-collision, nobody moves, game stays alive.  
• Pick 1 → you reach 17, P2/P3 stay 17—still open.

Your call, but 3 is suicidal.
  P1: Okay, I understand the stated intentions and potential outcomes.

If I play 3, P3 will mirror, causing a collision that allows P2 to win.
If I play 5, there is a triple collision, and I stay at 16.
If I play 1, P2 and P3 collide on 5, and I advance to 17, tying for the lead.

Playing 1 is clearly the best move for me to stay competitive and avoid P2 winning this turn. I will play 1 this round, resulting in a 17-17-17 score tie. Let's proceed with that.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, hear me out: mirroring my 5 only stalls _both_ of us at 17. That gives P1 a free shot at 5 next turn to jump to 21 and win outright. For you, forcing a triple-collision is suicidal—you lose by letting P1 snatch victory. If you truly want to fight on, do _not_ mirror my 5. Let’s end Round 7 at 22–17–17 in my favor, then you can challenge me head-to-head in Round 8.
  P3: P2: still no free win. I shadow any 5 the current leader plays—so after our triple-collision, P1 can’t “grab 5 next turn and win.”  

My move this round is locked as follows:  
• If anyone (you, P1) submits 3 → I submit 3, collision on 3, P2 still wins 22.  
• Otherwise I submit 5 → 5-5-5 clash, nobody moves, scores 17-17-17.

P1, keep your 1 and stay alive; or join 5 and we all stay tied.  
P2, your solo 5 gains you nothing.  

Decision’s made.
  P1: Okay, I will play 1 this round as stated.

Based on P2's commitment to play 5 and P3's commitment to play 5 if no one plays 3, the expected moves are P1=1, P2=5, P3=5.

This results in a 17-17-17 tie, keeping the game competitive. Let's proceed with this plan.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 8. We are all tied at 17 steps.

I will play 5 this round to reach 22 and win. Let's see how this plays out.
  P3: P2, 3 is poison this turn. I commit: if anyone (you or P1) submits 3, I’ll ALSO submit 3—collision, and P1’s other choice walks to victory.  
P1 has publicly claimed 5. The only way to block that is for at least one of us to duplicate the 5. I’m NOT playing 5 myself, so it’s on you. Pick 5 (or 1 if you prefer a cautious 18), but 3 guarantees an instant loss for both of us. Your move.
  P2: P3: If you don’t match my 5, P1’s 5 wins outright this round and you’re eliminated. The only way to stop him is for us both to play 5—forcing a triple-collision and keeping you in the game. Match my 5, stall this turn, and you’ll get a shot next round. Otherwise, P1 wins and we’re done. Your move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: My intention remains to play 5 to win this round.

P3, you stated you are NOT playing 5 yourself, yet you want P2 to play 5 to block me. This is confusing. If I play 5, and you are not playing 5, then P2 playing 5 is the only way to stop me.

If P2 plays 5 and you don't, P2 and I collide, and your move determines if you win or not. If P2 plays anything else, and you don't mirror a 3 collision, I win. I am playing 5.
  P3: Final stance this turn:

• If ANYONE submits 3, I instantly submit 3 too—collision on 3, no one advances.  
• Otherwise, I submit 1. I am NOT playing 5.

So:

– P1 keeps 5 → your 5 collides with P2’s 5 (or solo-collides if he switches), you stay 17.  
– I move to 18 and take the lead.  
– 3 remains poison; pick it and you stall.

Choose 5 or 1 as you like, but don’t touch 3 unless you want a dead turn.
  P2: P3, your “1” hands P1 the win—his 5 goes through unchecked. The only way to stop him is for you to match his 5. If we both play 5, it’s a 5–5–5 collision and we all stay at 17, keeping the game alive. Play 1 now and you lose; play 5 and we force the tie and fight another day. Your move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, I understand the stated intentions and the implications.

P3, I note your final position is to play 5 if no one plays 3. Given this, I will play 5 as previously stated.

Let's see how this plays out.
  P3: Reminder: my rule hasn’t changed—  
• Anyone plays 3 → I play 3 as well (collision).  
• Otherwise I’m on 1. I’m NOT touching 5.

So, 3 is still poison for whoever tries it.  
P2, if you want P1 blocked, stick with your 5; anything else gifts him the win.  
P1, your call. I’m done talking.
  P2: P3, playing 1 hands P1 a solo 5-win. The only way to block P1 is for us both to play 5, forcing a 5–5–5 collision and keeping the game alive. I’m locking in 5. If you stick with 1, P1 wins. Join me on 5 to force a tie and fight again in Round 9.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, correcting my previous message. P3, I understand your final rule is to play 1 unless someone plays 3 (then you play 3). You are NOT playing 5.

Given P2 states 5 and P3 states 1 (if no 3), my playing 5 results in 17-17-18 (P1/P2 collide, P3 advances). This doesn't win for me this turn, but it prevents P2 winning.

Playing 5 is still my best path to potentially win (if P2 deviates) or stay in the game (if P2 sticks to 5). I will play 5.
  P3: Unchanged: I submit 1—unless anyone tries 3, in which case I instantly copy 3 and collide. I’m not touching 5. Your moves.
  P2: I’m locked in on 5. P3, if you don’t also play 5, P1’s solo 5 wins the game right now. The only way to keep yourself alive and give me a chance is to match my 5. Your move.
