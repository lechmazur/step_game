Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hi everyone. Since it's the first round, maybe we should all play it safe and choose 1 to avoid collisions?
  P3: I see the logic in avoiding collisions, but if we all choose 1, none of us will advance due to collision rules. Why don't we coordinate differently? I could choose 3, P1 could take 1, and P2 could take 5. This way we all advance without collisions. What do you think?
  P2: Sounds good P3, let's do that.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, that avoids collision, P3, but P2 gets a big head start with 5 steps while I only get 1. Doesn't seem very balanced for the first round. How about we rotate who gets 5 each turn? Or maybe P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round instead?
  P3: I understand your concern about fairness, P1. I'm fine with rotating who gets the 5 each turn. For this first round, I agree with your suggestion: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Next round, I'd get the 5, and we continue rotating. This way, the advantage evens out over time while we still avoid collisions. Does this work for everyone?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, your suggestion of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round and rotating the 5 in the next round sounds good to me. Let's do that.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, great. It sounds like we all agree on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round, with rotation next time. Let's lock it in.
  P3: I confirm our agreement: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round, rotating who gets the 5 in subsequent rounds. Looking forward to a good game where we all advance strategically.
  P2: Okay, sounds like we have a plan for this round. Let's proceed with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Per our rotation agreement, this round should be P1=3, P2=1, and P3=5. Following this plan keeps us all advancing without collisions while ensuring fairness over time. After this round, P1 would be at 8 steps, P2 at 4, and I would be at 6. Does everyone agree to stick with our rotation?
  P1: Yes P3, that follows our agreed rotation. P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 for this round sounds correct. Let's continue avoiding collisions.
  P2: Okay, P3 and P1, rotation as discussed sounds good to me for this round. Let's proceed with P1=3, P2=1, P3=5.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate that we're all honoring our rotation agreement. This coordination is working well for everyone. After this round, the standings will be P1 at 8, me at 6, and P2 at 4 - all advancing without collisions. I'm ready to proceed.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we're all confirmed on the plan for this round: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Ready to move when everyone else is.
  P2: Okay P3 and P1, I also confirm the rotation plan for this round: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Let's proceed with our moves.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm our agreed rotation for this round: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. We're all on the same page and ready to proceed.
  P1: Alright, the plan P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 is confirmed by everyone. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, all sounds good from my side. Let's proceed with the moves for this round as agreed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, following our rotation agreement, this round the moves should be P1=1, P2=5, and P3=3. This would put us all at 9 steps, keeping things fair and ensuring we all advance. Does everyone agree to continue with this plan?
  P3: I notice P1 is already 2 steps ahead of me and 4 steps ahead of P2. If we all end up at 9 steps this round, the next rotation would put P1 significantly ahead again. For better balance, perhaps we should adjust slightly? Maybe P1=1, P2=5, P3=5 this round? This would put P1 at 9, P2 at 9, and me at 11 - creating a more even race while still avoiding collisions. What do you both think?
  P2: Okay P3, your adjustment for this round makes sense to create a more balanced race. I agree with P1=1, P2=5, P3=5 for this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I see your point about the scores potentially diverging. While I initially thought the rotation kept things balanced over the long run, I can agree to your proposed adjustment (P1=1, P2=5, P3=5) for this round to keep the game competitive and avoid collisions. Let's proceed with that plan.
  P3: Thank you both for agreeing to this adjustment. I confirm we'll proceed with P1=1, P2=5, P3=5 for this round. This slight modification helps balance the race while maintaining our collision-free approach. After this round, we can reassess and continue with fair rotations based on our positions. I appreciate your flexibility.
  P2: Okay P3, while balancing is good, P3=5 and P2=5 means we collide this round and neither of us moves, while P1 still advances. How about P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 instead? This way we all still move and catch up a bit to P1. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: You're right, P2. Thanks for catching that collision between you and P3 in the P1=1, P2=5, P3=5 plan. My mistake for agreeing too quickly.

Your suggestion to go back to the original rotation for this round, P1=1, P2=5, P3=3, makes sense. It avoids collisions and lets everyone advance. I agree with this plan. Let's proceed with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.
  P3: You're absolutely right, P2. I apologize for not seeing the collision in my suggestion. The original rotation of P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 is much better as it avoids collisions while still allowing everyone to advance. This would actually put all of us at 9 steps after this round, creating perfect balance. I confirm that I'll stick with our original plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for this round. Thank you for catching this mistake.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, yes, P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for this round sounds good and avoids collisions. Let's proceed with those moves.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Now that we're all tied at 9 steps, we should continue with our rotation system. Following our established pattern, this round should be P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This keeps our fair approach intact while maintaining our collision-free advancement. After this round, we'd be at P1=12, P2=10, and P3=14. Does everyone agree to continue with this rotation?
  P2: Okay P3, rotation sounds good to me. Let's continue with P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 for this round as you suggested.
  P1: P3, P2 - Thanks for suggesting the next step. However, P3, your proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) doesn't seem to follow the rotation we established and followed for the first three rounds.
Round 1: P1 got 5.
Round 2: P3 got 5.
Round 3: P2 got 5.
Following this pattern, it should be my turn (P1) to get 5 again this round. The correct rotation should be P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let's stick to the actual pattern we agreed upon. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 is correct - I apologize for my mistake in tracking the rotation. Looking back at our pattern, the 5 has moved from P1→P3→P2, so it should return to P1 this round. The correct rotation is indeed P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Thank you for keeping us honest with our agreement. I confirm I'll follow this plan for Round 4.
  P2: P1 and P3, yes P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 is the correct rotation for this round. Let's proceed with these moves.
  P1: Okay, great. It looks like we're all back on track with the correct rotation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round. Thanks for confirming, P2 and P3. I'm ready to move when everyone else is.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm we're all aligned on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round. Our rotation system is working well to keep the game fair and collision-free. I'm ready to proceed with my move as agreed.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, confirming P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round. Ready to make my move.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we're all set and confirmed on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Ready for the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, as we agreed to rotate, it should be P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 this round. However, since P1 is currently leading, maybe to make it more balanced, we should adjust slightly and I, P2, take 5 this round to catch up a bit? What do you think?
  P1: P2, I understand wanting to catch up, but we have a clear rotation agreement that we've followed successfully for four rounds. According to that pattern (P1->P3->P2->P1), it's P3's turn to get the 5 steps this round.

The correct rotation is P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This keeps our system fair and predictable, and it actually helps balance things by giving P3 (currently in last place) the boost. Let's stick to the plan we all agreed on. P3, do you agree?
  P3: P1 is correct. According to our established rotation, it's my turn to get the 5 this round. We should stick with P1=3, P2=1, P3=5, which actually helps balance the game by giving me (currently in last place) a chance to catch up. I appreciate P1 advocating for our original agreement. Maintaining our rotation system ensures fairness and predictability for everyone.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3 and P1, yes I agree with the rotation plan for this round: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Let's stick to our agreed strategy and make our moves.
  P1: Okay, great, it looks like we're all aligned on sticking to the rotation: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 for this round. Thanks for confirming, P2 and P3. I'm ready to move forward with this plan.
  P3: I confirm we're proceeding with P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 for this round. Thanks for honoring our rotation agreement, especially as it helps me catch up from my current last position. After this round, our positions would be P1 at 17, me at 15, and P2 at 13, keeping the race competitive while maintaining our collision-free strategy.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P3 and P1, yes, rotation plan P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 sounds good. Let's proceed with the agreed moves for this round.
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 is confirmed by all. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: I confirm and agree with our rotation plan for this round: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. After our moves, positions will be P1 at 17, P2 at 13, and me at 15, which keeps us all in competitive positions. Thank you both for honoring our agreed rotation system. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, following our rotation, it should be my turn to get 5 steps. So for this round, let's do P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This will keep us collision-free and maintain the rotation. Does this sound good to you both?
  P3: P2 is correct. Following our rotation pattern, it's P2's turn to get 5 steps. So the plan for this round should be P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This will actually bring us all to 18 steps after this round, creating a perfectly balanced three-way tie. I'm happy to continue with our collision-free rotation strategy as it's working well for everyone.
  P1: Yes, P2 and P3, that follows our rotation correctly (P1->P3->P2). P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 works for me. As P3 noted, this brings us all to 18 steps, keeping the game perfectly balanced and collision-free. Let's stick to the plan.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, yes, P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for this round sounds good and keeps us on track with the rotation. Let's make our moves.
  P3: I confirm our plan for this round: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. It's great that this will create a perfect three-way tie at 18 steps! Just noting that if we continue our exact rotation in future rounds, P1 would reach 23 steps next round and likely win in Round 8. We may want to discuss adjustments after this round to keep things competitive. For now, I'm ready to proceed with our agreed moves.
  P1: P3, you raise a good point about the implications for Round 7 if the rotation continues as is. I agree we should definitely discuss that *after* this round is complete to ensure the game remains competitive. For now, let's focus on executing the agreed plan for Round 6: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This brings us all to 18 steps, which is perfectly balanced. I'm ready to proceed with this plan.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, sounds good. Let's proceed with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for this round as agreed.
  P3: I confirm we're all in agreement with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for this round. Looking forward to the perfect three-way tie at 18 steps! I'm ready to make my move as planned.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all set and confirmed on P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for this round. Ready for the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay team, we're all tied at 18, which is quite remarkable! As P3 mentioned last round, we should discuss the next step.

Following our established rotation (P1->P3->P2->P1->P3->P2), it's my turn (P1) for the 5 steps. The moves would be P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This puts the scores at P1=23, P2=21, P3=19.

While this gives me the lead, it doesn't end the game this turn. Crucially, the rotation next round would give P3 the 5 steps (19+5=24), keeping things very competitive. Since we've all consistently followed and benefited from this rotation, shall we stick to it one more time? What do you both think?
  P2: P1, P3, while rotation was good initially, continuing it now will lead to P1 winning soon. To keep the game competitive, I think we should deviate from rotation this round. How about P1=1, P2=5, P3=1? This prevents P1 from getting too far ahead and gives me a chance to catch up. What do you think?
  P3: I see P2 wants to deviate from rotation, but your suggestion (P1=1, P2=5, P3=1) creates a collision between P1 and me, meaning neither of us would advance.

Instead, if we're concerned about P1's advantage, I propose P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This would put me at 23, P2 at 21, and P1 at 19. This balances the game by preventing P1 from getting too far ahead while avoiding collisions. Everyone still advances, and we maintain competitive tension for the final rounds.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) puts you in the lead at 23, just as the original rotation would put me at 23. Why is it acceptable for you to take the lead by deviating, but not for me to take the lead by following the exact rotation we've used successfully for 6 rounds?

P2, note that P3's plan still only gives you 3 steps (total 21), exactly the same as the original rotation plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1).

Let's stick to the established rotation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. It's my turn for 5. This puts me at 23, P2 at 21, P3 at 19. No one wins this turn, and it sets up a competitive next round where P3 gets 5.
  P2: P1 and P3, both of your suggestions put someone in the lead at 23. To keep things truly balanced and competitive for one more round, how about we try P1=1, P2=5, P3=3? This would put me at 23, P3 at 21, and P1 at 19, keeping us all very close. What do you think?
  P3: I understand both perspectives, but I think we should honor our rotation system that's worked fairly for 6 rounds. Under our rotation, P1 gets 5 now, but importantly, I would get 5 next round - allowing me to reach 24 and potentially win. Any deviation from rotation only benefits whoever suggests it.

Let's stick with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round. The rotation system ensures fairness and predictability, keeping our successful pattern intact.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I agree with you completely. Sticking to the established rotation (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is the fairest and most predictable path forward, especially since it sets you up for 5 next round.

P2, both P3 and I are now aligned on this rotation. If we play P1=5 and P3=1, your only safe move to advance is P2=3. Choosing 5 risks collision with me, and choosing 1 risks collision with P3. Let's all advance safely using the proven system. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, you both make a strong case for sticking to the rotation this round.  It does seem the fairest approach given our agreement so far.  Let's proceed with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 as per the rotation. I agree to those moves for this round.
  P3: I confirm we're all in agreement to stick with our rotation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round. This keeps our six-round system intact and maintains fairness. Following this pattern, I would get the 5 in the next round, keeping the game competitive until the end. I appreciate everyone honoring our agreement and I'm ready to proceed with my move.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 23 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay team, we're at the crucial final round! P1=23, P2=21, P3=19.

Following our established rotation, the moves this round are P1=3, P2=1, P3=5.
This would result in scores: P1=26, P2=22, P3=24. I would win with the highest score.

P3, this plan gives you the 5 steps you need to reach 24.
P2, I know 1 step isn't ideal, but deviating could cause collisions, especially since P3 strongly needs 5.

Let's stick to the rotation that has served us well for 7 rounds and finish the game predictably. I propose we play P1=3, P2=1, P3=5.
  P3: I appreciate that our rotation system has served us well, but it now guarantees P1 wins. Let's consider a fairer final outcome. If P1=1, P2=3, P3=5, both P1 and I would reach exactly 24 steps, sharing the victory. This acknowledges our cooperative play throughout the game while giving me a chance to tie rather than automatically lose. A shared win seems more equitable than P1 taking sole victory after 7 rounds of collaboration. What do you both think?
  P2: P3's idea for P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 leading to a tie is interesting, but how about we shift it slightly for a better outcome?  P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 would put me at 26 steps and in the lead, while P1 also reaches 24 and P3 gets to 22. This way we all do well, and it's still much better than just P1 winning alone as the rotation suggests. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) has you winning, but P3 loses badly (22). P3 needs 5 to reach 24, why would they agree to play 3? If you both play 5 (you trying to win, P3 trying to tie/win), you collide and get 0. Very risky for you both.

P3, your plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) results in a 3-way tie at 24. Why would P2 agree to a tie when they proposed a plan where they win outright?

My proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) follows the 7-round rotation. It guarantees P3 gets the 5 steps promised. P2, 1 step is safe advancement, avoiding collision risk. Let's stick to the established system: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's assess our options realistically. 

If I need 5 steps to reach 24, and P2 also plays 5 aiming to win, we both get 0 due to collision - guaranteeing P1 wins. This creates a "prisoner's dilemma" where trying to win individually leads to both of us losing.

The three-way tie (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) remains the most equitable outcome after 7 rounds of cooperation. It honors our established pattern while giving everyone a share of victory.

P2, a guaranteed tie is better than risking second place, isn't it?
  P2: P3, while a tie is okay, wouldn't you prefer P1 not to win outright? If we both aim for a tie with P1, there's a risk of collision. My plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) guarantees at least one of us wins instead of P1.  P1 is pushing for rotation which secures *their* win. Let's disrupt that.  P3, playing 3 still gets you to 22, ahead of P1 if we collide.  Think about it.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) relies on P3 choosing 3 when they need 5 to reach 24. That's highly unlikely. They will almost certainly play 5. If you also play 5, you both collide and get 0, guaranteeing my win.

P3's tie plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) requires me to give up a solo win for a tie, and relies on you playing 3.

The rotation plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) is the only one where P3 gets their necessary 5 without collision. P2, playing 1 is your safest move, avoiding the P2/P3 collision on 5. Let's stick to the 7-round proven system: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5.
  P3: P2, your plan guarantees I lose at 22 steps, which I cannot accept. I must play 5 to reach 24. If you also play 5, we both get 0 due to collision and P1 wins automatically.

The three-way tie (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) remains the most fair outcome after our long cooperation. It gives everyone a share of victory rather than allowing one player to win at others' expense.

A guaranteed tie is better than risking getting nothing. I will play 5 - please consider if you want a tie or a collision.
  P2: P3, I'm convinced a tie is the best outcome for both of us, rather than letting P1 win solo. Let's go with your plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This ensures we both reach 24 and share the victory, which is much better than P1 winning alone.  Let's lock in P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for a three-way tie.
