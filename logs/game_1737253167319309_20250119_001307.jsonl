To recap, P1 suggested a rotation plan with P1 taking 5 steps, P2 taking 3 steps, and P3 taking 1 step. I agree with this approach, but I'd like to propose a slight modification: P1 takes 5 steps, I take 3 steps, and P3 takes 1 step. This way, we can still avoid collisions while also allowing for some flexibility in our strategy. What do you think, P1 and P3?"}
