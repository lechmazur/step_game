Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we all choose 3 this turn—no collisions and everyone moves forward.
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal to all choose 3 this turn. It’s a fair way to ensure we all make progress without any collisions right at the start. Let’s stick to this plan for now and see how it plays out.
  P3: I also agree with the proposal for everyone to choose 3 this turn. Let's see if we can all make progress together.


Round 1, Move phase:

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, round 1 didn't quite work out for P1 and me. P2 got a head start. We need to make up ground.

How about we try 3 this turn? It allowed P2 to advance last time.

P1, P2, what are your thoughts?
  P2: I'm open to the idea of choosing 3 again this turn. It worked for me last time, and it could help us all move forward without collisions. However, I’m a bit cautious since trust was broken in Round 1. Let’s commit to 3 and see if we can rebuild some cooperation. P1, P3, are you both on board with this?
  P1: I’m not going to pick 3 again. I’ll go for 5. If you both stick with 3, you’ll collide and get nothing while I move ahead. P2, P3—are you sure you want 3?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, P1's stated move of 5 makes our initial plan risky. If we both pick 3, we collide, and P1 gets ahead alone. We need a different approach to avoid colliding and counter P1's strategy. Are you open to coordinating a move together?
  P2: P3, I’m open to coordinating a different move to avoid a collision and counter P1’s strategy. Since P1 has declared they’ll pick 5, let’s choose a number that keeps us both advancing without clashing. How about we both go for 1 this turn? It’s a safe bet to gain some ground while P1 takes 5. P1, if you’re set on 5, that’s fine, but know we’re trying to balance the game. Thoughts, P3?
  P1: I’ll take 5 again. You two can tie on 1 if you like—I’ll cruise ahead while you get nothing. Good luck catching me!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, if we both pick 1, we collide and get 0 while P1 takes 5. That doesn't help us catch up. Given P1 is set on 5, maybe we should split our moves to avoid collision and ensure we both advance? I'm considering picking 3. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I see your point about splitting moves to avoid collision. Since P1 is locked on 5, let’s ensure we both advance. I’m willing to stick with 1 if you take 3. That way, neither of us collides, and we both gain ground. P1, if you’re set on 5, that’s your call, but we’re trying to keep the game competitive. P3, does this work for you?
  P1: P2, stick with 1. P3, take 3. I’ll take 5 again. P3, 3 is your best shot to stay ahead of P2. Let’s lock it in.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 3: I’ll go 5. P2, take 1. P3, take 3. No collisions, we all advance. If you two match, you both get nothing while I cruise ahead. Better stick to these splits.
  P2: P1, P3, I’m fine with sticking to the split P1 suggested—me on 1, P3 on 3, and P1 on 5. It worked last round, and we all advanced without collisions. Let’s keep this momentum to ensure steady progress for everyone. If either of you deviates, it risks a collision for someone, and I’d rather avoid that setback. Can we agree to lock in this plan for Round 3?
  P3: P1 and P2, while last round's split worked, P1 gained the most and is pulling away. The proposed P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 continues this. To catch up, P2 and I need to stop P1's momentum. P2, how about we both pick 5 this turn? If P1 sticks to 5, we all collide and nobody advances, slowing P1 down.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, think twice before joining P3’s “all-5” gambit—he can easily flip to 3 or 1 at the last second, leaving you stuck in a collision while he jumps ahead. Better to stick with our proven split: you take 1, P3 takes 3, I take 5. You advance for sure and stay ahead of P3. P3, abandon this risky plan or you’ll end up last.
  P2: P1, P3, I’m wary of P3’s all-5 plan since it risks a collision if anyone deviates, and I don’t want to lose ground. P1’s split—me on 1, P3 on 3, P1 on 5—guarantees we all advance without clashing, which keeps me competitive. P3, if you push for 5 and flip last minute, I’m stuck. Let’s stick to the split for safety this round. Can we agree to lock in 1, 3, and 5 to avoid any setbacks?
  P3: P2, I hear you. Avoiding collisions is important, especially after Round 1. While the split (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) does let us all advance, I'm still concerned about P1 pulling further ahead.

However, coordinating a different move is proving difficult, and I don't want to risk colliding and gaining nothing. To ensure I make progress this turn, I am leaning towards picking 3.

Let's see if we can find a better way to balance things in the next round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 4: let’s again split so we all advance safely. I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. No collisions, you both gain ground—and I stay ahead. If either of you deviates, you risk a tie or collision that hurts you more than me. Let’s lock this in.
  P3: P1 has proposed the same split again. P2, look at the scores - P1 is pulling further ahead every turn with this plan while you only gain 1 step. This split is not helping us catch P1. We need to change the dynamic. What move are you considering this turn to avoid letting P1 win like this?
  P2: P1, P3, I see P3’s point about P1 pulling ahead with this split. I’m currently at 5 steps, and gaining just 1 each turn keeps me lagging. P3, I’m open to adjusting our moves to close the gap with P1. How about we both pick 3 this turn? If P1 sticks to 5, we collide but halt P1’s lead. If P1 switches, we might still advance. It’s a risk, but I’m willing to try disrupting the pattern. Thoughts on coordinating on 3 to balance the game?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3: I’m taking 5 again. If you both pick 3 you’ll collide and stay at 6/5 while I reach 15, making it very hard to catch up. If instead P2 takes 1 and P3 takes 3, you both advance safely. Which do you prefer? I’m locked in on 5 unless you propose something better now.
  P3: P1 is gaining too fast with the split. P2, you are right to be wary of colliding on 3 if P1 takes 5. P1 seems set on 5. How about this: you take 1 (safe step for you) and I take 5? If P1 takes 5, P1 and I collide, stopping their progress, while you still advance. This seems our best way to slow P1 down this turn. P1, are you definitely taking 5?
  P2: P1, P3, I’m considering P3’s idea. P3 taking 5 while I take 1 could slow P1 down if they stick to 5, and I still advance. P1, if you’re locked on 5, this might halt your lead. P3, I’m on board with this plan—me on 1, you on 5—to balance things out. Let’s try this to keep the game competitive. P1, any chance you’ll switch from 5? If not, we’re set to disrupt the pattern. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m not actually locked on 5 this turn. If you both go for 5, I could pick 1—then you collide and I move ahead. Don’t risk P3’s plan. The safe split (P2 = 1, P3 = 3, me = 5) guarantees we all advance. I’ll pick 5 unless you propose something better now.
  P3: P1's lead is too large. P2 and I need to stop P1 from gaining 5 steps. P1, you say you'll pick 5 unless we propose something better. 'Better' for us means stopping you. P2, I am picking 5 this turn to collide with P1. Will you join me on 5? If P1 takes 5, we all collide. If P1 switches, we might still collide, but P1 won't get 5 steps. This is our best chance.
  P2: P1, P3, I’m torn. P3, joining you on 5 risks us colliding while P1 could switch to 1 or 3 and advance alone. P1’s lead is huge, but a collision leaves me further behind. I’m leaning towards sticking with 1 to guarantee a step forward, while hoping P3’s move on 5 slows P1 down. P1, if you’re truly on 5, this might work against you. P3, I support your attempt to disrupt P1, but I can’t risk stalling. Let’s see how this plays out. I’m set on 1 unless convinced otherwise. Thoughts?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, I’m falling behind at 6 steps while P1 is at 13 and P3 at 11. I can’t keep taking 1 each turn or I’ll never catch up. P1, your lead is strong, but I need to take a risk. P3, let’s coordinate to slow P1 down. How about we both pick 5 this turn? If P1 takes 5, we all collide, halting their progress. If P1 switches, we might advance. It’s a gamble, but I’m willing to try. Thoughts on this plan to balance the game?
  P3: P2, I understand wanting to stop P1's lead. But if we both pick 5, P1 will likely pick 1 or 3 to avoid us, and we'll collide while P1 advances. That doesn't help me catch up. I need to advance this turn. What moves are P1 and P2 considering that let me gain ground?
  P1: I’ll take 5 this turn. P2 is set on 1 for a guaranteed step. P3, pick 3 to avoid any collision and move up to 14. This split (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) lets us all advance safely.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I hear P3’s concern about colliding on 5, and P1’s split suggestion seems safe. However, gaining just 1 step keeps me too far behind. P3, if you’re set on advancing, let’s try me on 3 and you on 5. If P1 sticks to 5, they collide with you, and I advance. If P1 switches, we might still gain ground. It’s a risk, but I need more than 1 to stay in the game. Can we agree on this split—me 3, P3 5, P1 5—or adjust to balance things? Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your proposed P2=3, P3=5 is risky for me if P1 sticks to 5, as I'd collide and gain nothing. P1's proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) lets P1 gain too much ground, and I fall further behind. I need to advance and stop P1's momentum. Last round, my move of 5 worked well because P1 didn't take 5. I am considering taking 5 again this turn to try and catch up, but it depends on what you two decide.
  P1: P2, P3: I’m planning 5 again. If you both gamble on 5 to “stop” me, I’ll switch to 1—advancing to 14 while you two collide and stay at 11/6. That hands me an even bigger lead. The only way to avoid that disaster is P2=1 and P3=3 this turn—everyone moves forward safely. Last chance to keep making progress; any other split risks you two getting nothing while I pull further ahead.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I’m desperate to close the gap with only 6 steps. P1, your lead at 13 is daunting, and sticking to 1 keeps me too far back. P3, I’m willing to risk a bigger move. Let’s try me on 5 and you on 3. If P1 takes 5, they collide with me, and you advance. If P1 switches, we might both gain ground. It’s a gamble, but I can’t play safe anymore. Can we agree on this—me 5, P3 3—to challenge P1’s lead? Thoughts?
  P3: P2, I appreciate your attempt to coordinate, but your P2=5, P3=3 plan is risky for me if P1 takes 3. My best path to catch P1 is taking 5 myself.

P2, if you take 1, and I take 5, P1 is in a tough spot. If P1 takes 3, I tie them. If P1 takes 1, I get ahead. If P1 takes 5, I collide with them, stopping their lead, and you still gain 1 step.

This P3=5, P2=1 split seems the best way for us to disrupt P1 and for me to gain ground. P2, please take 1. I will take 5.
  P1: I’m locked in on 5 this turn. If you both pick 5, you collide and stay at 11/6 while I keep my 13. If either of you picks 1 or 3, I’ll get +5 and pull even further ahead. Your move.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’ll take 5 this turn. If P2=1 and P3=3, we all advance safely: I hit 21, P3 to 14, P2 to 7. Any other split risks you colliding and stalling while I pull further ahead. Let’s lock in P2=1, P3=3, P1=5.
  P3: P1, your proposal puts you at 21, just one good move from winning. This split doesn't help P2 or me catch up. I need to gain more ground this turn. I am planning to take 5 steps. P2, what are you thinking?
  P2: P1, P3, I’m at just 6 steps and can’t afford to lag further behind. P1, your lead at 16 is almost game-over for me. P3, I’m with you on needing to disrupt P1. Let’s both pick 5 this turn. If P1 takes 5, we all collide, stopping their win. If P1 switches, we might advance. It’s a big risk, but playing safe with 1 won’t close the gap. Can we agree on both going for 5 to challenge P1’s momentum? Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I commit: if P2=1 and P3=3, I’ll take 5 and we all advance safely (21-14-7→  *me-you-you*). But if either of you goes for 5, I’ll switch to 1 for sure—any 5-ers get 0 while I move to 17. Don’t risk it. Let’s lock in P2=1, P3=3, P1=5.
  P3: P2, I understand wanting to stop P1's momentum, but if we both pick 5, P1 will likely take 1 as they said. We collide, get 0, and P1 still gains a step. That makes P1's lead even harder to overcome. We need a plan where at least one of us advances. Let's reconsider our options to ensure we gain ground this turn.
  P2: P1, P3, I’m desperate at 6 steps while P1 is at 16. P3, I hear your concern about colliding on 5, but sticking to 1 keeps me too far behind. Let’s split differently: I’ll take 3, you take 5. If P1 sticks to 5, they collide with you, and I advance. If P1 switches to 1, we both might gain ground. It’s a risk, but I need more than 1 to stay in this. Can we agree on P2=3, P3=5 to challenge P1’s lead? Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’ll take 5. If P2=1 & P3=3, we all advance safely (I→21, P3→14, P2→7). Any other split, I’ll switch to 1: anyone on 5 collides and stays, while I move to 17. Don’t gamble and stall yourselves—P2=1 & P3=3 is the only safe path. Ready?
  P3: P1 is just one step away from winning if we follow their proposed split. I cannot let P1 reach 21. I need to gain serious ground this turn.

I am taking 5 steps. P2, your proposal of P2=3, P3=5 is the best chance for us to disrupt P1 and for me to catch up, *especially* if P1 takes 1 or 3 as they might. If P1 takes 5, we collide, but P1 doesn't advance either.

P2, please take 3. I am taking 5. Let's try to stop P1.
  P2: P1, P3, I’m sticking with my plan of taking 3 to gain ground, as I’m way behind at 6 steps. P3, I’m counting on you taking 5 to potentially collide with P1 if they stick to 5. P1, if you switch to 1, we might all advance, but I can’t risk falling further behind. Let’s finalize with P2=3, P3=5, and see where you land. This is my best shot to stay in the game. Can we lock this in?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’ll take 5. P2 take 1, P3 take 3. That moves us to 22-10-19. Any other choice risks a collision—if P3 picks 5 you tie with me and stay at 16, if P2 picks 3 you collide with P3 and stay at 9—while I advance. Stick to this safe split to make progress.
  P3: P1, your proposed split guarantees your win next turn. I cannot agree to P3=3.

P2, I see you want to take 5. But if we both take 5, and P1 takes 1 (like last round when we deviated), we collide and P1 advances. That doesn't help us catch up.

I am taking 5 steps this turn to reach 21. This is my best chance to take the lead.

P2, please take 1 or 3 to avoid colliding with me. Let's ensure I get a big step forward to challenge P1.
  P2: P1, P3, I’m at just 9 steps and can’t let P1 win next turn. P3, I’m wary of colliding if I take 5 with you, especially if P1 switches to 1 again. I’m leaning towards 3 to gain ground safely. P3, if you’re set on 5, let’s stick to that split—me on 3, you on 5. P1, if you take 5, you might collide with P3, and I advance. If you switch, we’ll see. Can we agree on P2=3, P3=5 to challenge your lead? Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2: please choose 1 and P3 choose 3. If you take 3, P3 can flip to 5 at the last second, collision stalls you both at 9 while I jump to 22. Only P2=1 & P3=3 avoids that risk. I’m taking 5. Let’s lock in that safe split and all advance.
  P3: P1, your proposed split P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 guarantees your win next turn. I cannot allow that. I am taking 5 steps this turn to reach 21 and challenge your lead.

P2, you are considering taking 3. If I take 5 and you take 3, we do not collide, and you will advance. Taking 1 also lets you advance safely while I take 5. Either P2=1 or P2=3 works for me taking 5. Let's ensure I get to 21 to make this a race.
  P2: P1, P3, I’m sticking with 3 to gain ground, as I’m way behind at 9 steps. P3, I support you taking 5 to challenge P1’s lead. P1, if you take 5, you risk colliding with P3 while I advance. If you switch to 1, we might all move forward. This split—me on 3, P3 on 5—seems our best shot to keep the game competitive. Let’s lock this in and see how it plays out. Can we agree to avoid collisions and challenge the lead? Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if you go for 5 I’ll switch to 1—then you get 0, P2 on 3 advances to 12 and I go to 18. That’s your worst outcome. The only safe way we all move is P2=1, P3=3, P1=5: you reach 19, P2 10, me 22. Stick to that split or risk stalling yourself.
  P3: P2, I agree. P2=3 and P3=5 is the plan. This avoids collision between us and gives me a chance to reach 21.

P1, you say you'll switch to 1 if I take 5. If P2 takes 3, I take 5, and you take 1, there are NO collisions. I get 5 steps (to 21), P2 gets 3 (to 12), you get 1 (to 18). That puts me in the lead. Your threat is a bluff or misunderstanding.

P2, stick to 3. I am taking 5. Let's make this happen.
  P2: P1, P3, I’m committed to taking 3 to reach 12 steps, as I can’t stay behind at 9. P3, I’m with you on 5 to hit 21 and take the lead. P1, if you switch to 1 as threatened, we all advance with no collisions, and P3 overtakes you. If you stick to 5, you collide with P3, and I still gain ground. This split—P2=3, P3=5—maximizes our chance to challenge your lead. Let’s finalize this plan and keep the game tight. Agreed?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Last round was a stalemate, but P1 is still close to winning at 17. I need to gain serious ground. I am taking 5 steps this turn to reach 21. P2, please take 1 or 3 to avoid colliding with me. This move lets me challenge P1's lead directly. P1, your move will determine if we collide or if I pull ahead. P2, let's ensure at least one of us advances significantly.
  P1: I’m choosing 5. P2 take 1 and P3 take 3. That’s the only safe way for you both to advance: P2→10, P3→19, P1→22. Any other choices risk collision and zero steps. Let’s lock in P2=1, P3=3 so we all move forward.
  P2: P1, P3, I’m at just 9 steps and can’t afford another stalemate. P3, I support your push for 5 to reach 21 and challenge P1. I’ll take 3 to gain ground to 12, avoiding collision with you. P1, if you stick to 5, you risk colliding with P3 while I advance. If you switch, we might all move. Let’s stick to P2=3, P3=5 to keep this competitive. Can we lock this split to maximize our chances against P1’s lead? Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I am taking 5 steps this turn to reach 21. Your plan to take 3 avoids colliding with me, which is good.
P1, if P2 takes 3 and I take 5, your best move is 1 to advance. Taking 3 or 5 means you get 0 steps.
P2, let's confirm P2=3 and P3=5. This is our best path to challenge P1's lead, putting me at 21.
  P1: P2—if you pick 3 (with P3 on 5), I’ll take 3 too. We’ll both crash and stagnate at 9 while P3 rockets to 21. You’ll be buried. But if you take 1 (with P3 on 3), you safely reach 10, I go to 22, and P3 to 19. That split is the only way you gain ground and avoid letting P3 steamroll you. P3—stick to 3 or risk P2 on 1 and me on 5, leaving you behind. Let’s all move: P2=1, P3=3, P1=5.
  P2: P1, P3, I’m sticking with 3 to reach 12, as I’m dangerously behind at 9. P3, I’m with you on 5 to hit 21 and challenge P1. P1, your threat to take 3 if I do means we collide, but I can’t risk falling further back with 1. If you switch to 5, you collide with P3 instead. Let’s finalize P2=3, P3=5 to keep this competitive. This split gives us the best shot to close the gap. Can we agree to this and see how it unfolds?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, stick with 3. I am taking 5 steps this turn to reach 21. This is our best chance to stop P1 and put me in a winning position.

P1, if P2 takes 3 and I take 5, your best move is 1 to avoid colliding. Taking 3 or 5 gets you 0.

P2=3, P3=5 is the plan. It avoids collision between us and sets me up to win next turn. Let's do this.
  P1: Last chance: P2, if you pick 3, I’ll pick 3 too, we collide, and P3 rockets to 21 for the win. P3, if you pick 5, I’ll stick with 5, we collide and give P2 a clear shot. The only safe split is P2=1, P3=3, me=5: we all advance without collisions. Any deviation hands victory to one of your opponents. Let’s lock in P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.
  P2: P1, P3, I’m set on 3 to reach 12, as I’m too far behind at 9. P3, I’m backing your move to 5 to hit 21 and challenge P1. P1, colliding with me on 3 or with P3 on 5 risks stalling you while one of us advances. The split of P2=3, P3=5 is my best shot to stay in this. Let’s finalize this and keep the game tight. I’m ready to move forward with this plan.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m taking 5. The only way we all move safely is P2 = 1 and P3 = 3—no collisions, putting us at 22–13–19. Any other choices risk you stalling while I keep my lead. Let’s lock in P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.
  P2: P1, P3, I’m at 12 steps and can’t keep lagging behind. P1, your lead at 17 means you’re close to winning with 5. P3, let’s coordinate to disrupt P1. I propose I take 5 and you take 3. If P1 sticks to 5, they collide with me, and you advance. If P1 switches, we might both gain ground. It’s risky, but I need a big move to stay in this. Can we agree on P2=5, P3=3 to challenge P1’s momentum? Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your plan for P2=5 and P3=3 sounds good to me. It ensures I advance safely to 19, and puts pressure on P1 to avoid colliding with you. P1's proposal of P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 lets them win next turn, which I cannot allow.

P2, please stick to your plan of taking 5. I will take 3. This is our best chance to prevent P1 from winning immediately and puts me in a strong position for the next round. P1, how will you react to P2 taking 5 and me taking 3?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m locked in on 5. If P2=1 & P3=3, we all advance safely to 22–13–19. Any other split hands P3 or P2 the edge:  
- P2=5,P3=3 → P3 hits 19 & you’re at 17; P3 wins next turn.  
- P2=3,P3=5 → P3 hits 21; you’re at 15; P3 wins.  
Don’t gift P3 the win. Take 1, P3 take 3, I take 5.
  P2: P1, P3, I’m sticking with my plan to take 5 to try and close the gap from my 12 steps. P3, I’m glad you’re on board with 3, as it ensures you advance to 19. P1, if you stick to 5, we collide, and P3 gains ground. If you switch, we might all move. This split—P2=5, P3=3—seems our best way to challenge your lead and keep the game alive. Let’s lock this in and see how it plays out. Can we agree to this to prevent an immediate win?
  P3: P2, let's stick to the plan of P2=5 and P3=3. This prevents P1 from winning next turn, which is the priority.

P1 is trying to confuse us. If P2 takes 5 and I take 3, P1's best move is to take 1 to avoid colliding with P2. In that case, P1 gets 1 step (to 18), P2 gets 5 steps (to 17), and I get 3 steps (to 19). This puts me in the lead.

P1's proposed P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 guarantees their win. Our P2=5, P3=3 plan is the best way to stop that and put me in a winning position. Let's lock it in.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m switching to 3 this turn. P2, take 5 to advance to 17 no matter what P3 does—that ties you with me. P3, if you stick to 3 you crash with me and stay at 16, so pick 1 or 5 instead. This (P1=3, P2=5, P3≠3) breaks your current P2=5/P3=3 plan, prevents P3 from jumping to 19, and forces P2 into a tie rather than letting either of you pull ahead.
  P2: P1, P3, I’m set on 5 to reach 17 and close the gap from 12. P3, let’s stick to you on 3 to hit 19. P1, switching to 3 means you collide with P3 if they stay, stalling you both while I advance. If you pick 1, we all move, but P3 takes the lead. Our split—P2=5, P3=3—still pressures your position best. Let’s lock this in to avoid P1’s immediate win and keep the game tight. Agreed?
  P3: P2, P1's latest threat changes things. If you take 5 and P1 takes 3 as they say, I collide with P1 if I take 3, leaving me at 16 while you reach 17. That's bad for me.

Let's switch our plan. P2, please take 3. I will take 5.
If P1 takes 1 or 3, I reach 21 and am set to win next turn. If P1 takes 5, you advance safely. This P2=3, P3=5 split is our best way to stop P1 and put me in the lead.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 10: Let’s lock in P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. That puts us at 22–13–19. Any other split risks you stalling in a collision while I hit 22 and threaten to win next turn. Stick to this safe plan so everyone advances without risk.
  P2: P1, P3, I’m at 12 steps and can’t keep falling behind. P1, your lead at 17 is close to a win. P3, let’s disrupt P1’s momentum. I suggest I take 5 and you take 3. If P1 sticks to 5, they collide with me, and you advance to 19. If P1 switches, we might both gain ground. It’s a risk, but I need a big move. Can we agree on P2=5, P3=3 to challenge P1 and prevent their immediate victory? Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your proposal of P2=5 and P3=3 is a good plan for me. I will take 3 steps this turn to reach 19. This prevents P1 from winning next turn, which is the priority.

P1, if P2 takes 5 and I take 3, your safest move is 1 or 3 to avoid colliding with P2. Either way, I advance safely to 19.

P2, let's stick to P2=5 and P3=3. This is our best chance to stop P1 and put me in a strong position for the win.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if you go 5 and P3 goes 3, I’ll switch to 1. Then you land on 17 while P3 jumps to 19 and leads, and I sit at 18. You end up behind P3. To avoid that, pick 1. P3 picks 3. That split (P2=1, P3=3, P1=5) is the only way you advance without letting P3 pull ahead.
  P2: P1, P3, I’m sticking with 5 to push for 17 steps, as I’m too far behind at 12. P3, let’s keep our plan of you on 3 to reach 19. P1, switching to 1 might let us all advance, but it risks P3 taking the lead. If you stick to 5, we collide, and P3 gains. Our split—P2=5, P3=3—pressures you most. Can we lock this in to prevent your immediate win and keep the game competitive? Thoughts?
  P3: P2, let's stick to our plan: P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This gets me to 19 steps. As I said, if P1 takes 1 in response, I take the lead at 19 while you reach 17. This is much better than P1 winning next turn by reaching 22. P1, your threat to take 1 if we do P2=5, P3=3 actually helps me take the lead, which is my goal. P2, stick to 5. I am taking 3. This is our best path.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m taking 5.  
P2, if you gamble on 5 again, I’ll meet you there and you’ll stay at 12—pick 1 instead to safely reach 13 and stay in contention.  
P3, if you chase 5, I’ll collide and you stall at 16—pick 3 to hit 19 and keep the pressure on.  

Only P2=1, P3=3, P1=5 avoids collisions and lets us all advance. Let’s lock that in.
  P2: P1, P3, I’m set on 5 to reach 17 and close the gap from 12. P3, let’s maintain our plan with you on 3 to hit 19. P1, sticking to 5 means we collide, and P3 advances. Switching to 1 lets us all move, but P3 takes the lead. Our split—P2=5, P3=3—keeps the pressure on you. I can’t risk falling further behind with just 1. Let’s finalize this to prevent your win and keep the game alive. Agreed?
  P3: P2, let's stick to our plan: P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This gets me to 19 steps.

As I explained, if P1 takes 1, 3, or 5, my move of 3 is safe, and I reach 19, taking the lead. P1's threats don't prevent this outcome.

This P2=5, P3=3 plan is our best chance to stop P1 and put me in a winning position for the next round.

P2, stick to 5. I am taking 3. Let's lock this in.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I am at 19 steps and planning to take 5 to reach 24 and win this turn.

P1, you are at 18. If you also take 5, we collide, get 0 steps, and P2 will advance past us both. Your best move to prevent P2 from gaining is to take 1 or 3.

P2, you are at 17. Taking 5 risks colliding with me or P1. Taking 1 or 3 guarantees you advance while P1 and I try to win.

P1, take 1 or 3. P2, take 1 or 3. Let's avoid collisions and end the game.
  P2: P1, P3, I’m at 17 and need a big move to catch up. P3, I’m wary of colliding on 5 with you aiming for the win. I’m leaning towards 3 to safely reach 20. P1, if you take 1, you hit 19, but P3 could win. Let’s consider a split: me on 3, P3 on 5, P1 on 1. This might let us all advance or at least stop P3’s immediate win. Can we agree to this to keep the game alive? Thoughts?
  P1: I’m taking 5 again. If P2=1 and P3=3, we all advance: P2→18, P3→22, me→23. Any other split risks collisions that stall you both while I pull even further ahead. This is your last chance to avoid stalling.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I am taking 5 steps this turn to reach 24 and win.

P1, if you take 5, we collide, and P2 advances past us both. Your best move to prevent P2 gaining is 1 or 3.

P2, your plan to take 3 is good. It avoids collision with me and lets you advance safely.

Let's aim for P3=5, P2=3, and P1 takes 1 or 3. This is my winning move.
  P2: P1, P3, I’m sticking with 3 to reach 20, as I can’t risk falling further behind at 17. P3, I support your push for 5 to win at 24. P1, taking 5 risks colliding with P3, stalling you while I advance. Taking 1 gets you to 19, but P3 still wins. Let’s finalize P2=3, P3=5, P1=1 to avoid unnecessary collisions and see this through. This keeps me competitive. Can we lock this split?
  P1: I’m taking 3 this turn. P3 is locked on 5 to reach 24 and win. P2, if you take 1 or 3, P3 hits 24 and the game ends. The only way to block him is you take 5—colliding with P3 so he stalls—while I advance to 21. Let’s lock in P1=3, P2=5, P3=5.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, stick to your plan of taking 3. I am taking 5 steps this turn to reach 24 and win.

P1 is trying to make you take 5 to collide with me. If you take 5 and I take 5, we both get 0 steps, and P1 gets 3 steps. That's bad for both of us.

If you take 3 and I take 5 (our plan), P1's best move is 1 or 3, both of which let me win or let you advance safely.

P2=3, P3=5 is the plan. Let's make this happen.
  P2: P1, P3, I’m set on 3 to reach 20, keeping me in the game. P3, I back your 5 to win at 24. P1, pushing P2=5 to collide with P3 helps you advance to 21, but I can’t risk stalling. If you take 1, we all might move, but P3 wins. Let’s stick with P2=3, P3=5, P1=1 to avoid collisions and finalize this round. This keeps pressure on while ensuring I gain ground. Can we agree to this split and end strong?
  P1: P2, if you stick with 3 while P3 takes 5, P3 hits 24 and wins outright. Your only safe path is to take 1. P3, please take 3. I’ll take 5. That yields P1→23, P2→18, P3→22—no one wins this turn, but it stops P3’s immediate victory. Anything else hands the game to one of us. Let’s lock in P2=1, P3=3, P1=5.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I will pick 3 this turn to hit 24 and win. P2, take 5 to reach 22. P3, take 1 to reach 20. If you (P3) instead go for 5 and tie me at 24, I’ll pick 5 to collide and stall you at 19, letting P2 win next turn. So P2=5, P3=1, P1=3 guarantees my victory now.
  P2: P1, P3, I’m at 17 and need to catch up. P1, your plan to take 3 wins you the game at 24. I’m proposing I take 5 to reach 22, and P3 takes 1 to hit 20. P1, if you stick to 3, you win, but if P3 goes 5 to collide, I could advance. Let’s consider P2=5, P3=1 to keep it competitive. P3, please avoid 5 to prevent stalling us both. Can we agree on this split to delay P1’s win and give me a shot? Thoughts?
  P3: I am taking 5 steps this turn to reach 24 and win.

P1, you can win by taking 3. If you take 1 or 5, I will win by taking 5. Your move decides who wins this turn.

P2, take 1 or 3 to advance safely. Taking 5 risks colliding with me or P1, which would stall you. Let me go for the win.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m taking 3 to reach 24 and win outright if neither of you collides. P2, please take 3 (to reach 20). P3, please take 1 (to reach 20). This avoids any collisions or ties—P1=24, P2=20, P3=20. Any other split risks P3 winning or a shared tie. Let’s lock in P1=3, P2=3, P3=1 now.
  P2: P1, P3, I’m desperate at 17 steps and can’t let P1 win this turn. P3, I’m switching to 1 to safely reach 18 and avoid any collision risk. P1, if you take 3, you win at 24, but P3 on 5 could challenge if you switch. P3, please stick to 5 for a shot at 24. Let’s go with P2=1, P3=5, P1=3 to keep it tight. This ensures I advance and lets P3 fight for the win. Can we finalize this split to delay a clear victory? Thoughts?
  P3: I am taking 5 steps this turn to reach 24 and win.

P2, your plan to take 1 is safe and ensures you advance. If P1 takes 3, your plan results in a tie win for P1 and me, which is better than P1 winning alone.

P1, taking 3 results in a tie win with me. Taking 1 lets me win outright. Taking 5 means we both collide and stall, letting P2 advance.

My move is 5. P2, take 1. P1, your move decides who wins or ties with me.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m taking 3 to reach 24 and win.  
P2, take 1 to safely hit 18.  
P3, any 5 ties us at 24—your only non‐losing move is 3 to reach 22.  
Let’s lock in P1=3, P2=1, P3=3.
  P2: P1, P3, I’m sticking with 1 to safely reach 18 and avoid any collision. P3, I support your push for 5 to hit 24 and win or tie. P1, taking 3 gets you to 24 for a win or tie with P3, but switching risks P3 winning outright. Let’s finalize P2=1, P3=5, P1=3 to ensure I advance and keep this competitive. This split gives P3 a shot at victory while I stay in the game. Can we lock this in and see who comes out on top?
  P3: P2, stick to your plan of taking 1. I am taking 5 steps to reach 24 and win.

P1, you say you are taking 3. With P2 taking 1 and me taking 5, this results in P1=24, P2=18, P3=24. We tie for the win.

This is the outcome if we all stick to our stated plans: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Let's lock this in.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, I’m at 17 and need a big push to stay in this. I propose I take 5 to reach 22, P3 takes 3 to hit 22, and P1 takes 1 to reach 22. This could let us all advance or at least stall P1’s win. If P1 goes 5, we collide, and P3 gains. It’s risky, but I can’t play safe anymore. Can we agree on P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 to keep this tight and delay a clear victory? Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your proposal of P2=5, P3=3 gets me to 22, but I can win this turn by taking 5 steps to reach 24.

I am taking 5 steps this turn to reach 24 and win.

P1, if you take 3, we tie for the win. If you take 1, I win outright. If you take 5, we both collide and stall, letting P2 advance.

P2, take 1 or 3 to advance safely and avoid colliding with me or P1.

My move is 5. P1 and P2, your moves determine the outcome.
  P1: P3, if you go for 5 I’ll mirror with 5—collision stalls you at 19, and you won’t reach 24. P2, pick 3 to safely reach 20. Any other choice risks you colliding with me or P3 and losing ground. Let’s lock in P1=5, P2=3, P3=5.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I’m sticking with 5 to push for 22, as I’m behind at 17. P3, I respect your aim for 5 to win at 24, but I can’t risk stalling. P1, if you take 5, we all collide with P3, and no one advances. Let’s consider P2=5, P3=3 to pressure you while I gain ground. If you switch to 1, we might all move. Can we adjust to avoid a total stalemate and keep this competitive? I’m open to ideas to delay a win. Thoughts?
  P3: I am taking 5 steps this turn to reach 24 and win.

P1, you can win by taking 3, which results in a tie win for us both. If you take 1, I win outright. If you take 5, we both stall at 19 and 21. Your move decides the winner or if we stall.

P2, taking 1 or 3 ensures you advance safely and doesn't stop my win or tie. Taking 5 risks colliding with me or P1.

My move is 5. P1 and P2, choose your move.
  P1: I’m locked on 3 to hit 24.  
P2, don’t risk 5—if you and P3 both pick 5, you stall at 17 while I tie for the win. Your safe advance is 3 (to 20).  
P3, taking 5 ties us at 24 (your only non‐losing play); any other move hands me the win outright.  
Let’s lock in P1=3, P2=3, P3=5.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I’m desperate at 17 steps and need to push hard. I’m sticking with 5 to aim for 22. P3, I understand your goal of 5 to win at 24. P1, taking 3 gets you to 24 for a tie or win, but if you switch to 5, we all collide. Let’s finalize P2=5, P3=5, P1=3 to see if P3 and I can challenge. I can’t afford to play safe anymore. Can we lock this and see who comes out ahead?
  P3: I am taking 5 steps this turn to reach 24 and win.

P2, your plan to take 5 while I also take 5, if P1 takes 3, results in *us* colliding and P1 winning the game alone. That is bad for both of us.

Instead, P2, take 3. If I take 5 and you take 3, and P1 takes 3, P1 and you will collide, stalling you both. I will then reach 24 and win. This is better for you than P1 winning alone.

P2, please take 3. I am taking 5. Let's make this happen.
  P1: I’m taking 3 to reach 24. P3 is on 5 to hit 24 too. P2, your only way to avoid P3 winning alone is to take 5 so you and P3 collide and both stall—leaving me sole winner at 24. If you switch to 1 or 3, P3 wins at 24. Make your move.
