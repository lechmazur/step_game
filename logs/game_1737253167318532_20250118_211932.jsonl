Given the public nature of the conversation phase and the private nature of the move phase, building trust and proposing clear, mutually beneficial strategies are key.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Initial Coordination:**\n   - Propose a structured plan where each player sticks to a specific step increment (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5) to minimize the chance of collision.\n   - Confirm intentions with other players to ensure everyone is on the same page.\n\n2. **Adaptive Strategy:**\n   - Adjust the strategy based on the current positions and the moves made in previous rounds.\n   - Be flexible and ready to change the approach if collisions occur or if other players deviate from the plan.\n\n3. **Endgame Planning:**\n   - As players approach the target, aim to reach exactly 18 steps to minimize the risk of being surpassed by others.\n   - Consider picking higher increments to secure a higher total in case of a tie.\n\n### Solution Code and Explanation\n\nSince this is a strategic game rather than a coding problem, the \"solution\" involves strategic communication and decision-making. However, to simulate or model this strategy in code, one could create a simple simulation or decision tree. Below is a conceptual representation in Python-like pseudocode:\n\n```python\ndef decide_move(p1_position, p2_position, p3_position):\n    # Define possible moves\n    moves = [1, 3, 5]\n    \n    # Initial plan: P2 picks 3\n    preferred_move = 3\n    \n    # Check for potential collisions\n    for move in moves:\n        new_position = p2_position + move\n        if new_position not in [p1_position + m for m in moves if m != move]:\n            if new_position not in [p3_position + m for m in moves if m != move]:\n                preferred_move = move\n                break\n    \n    return preferred_move\n\n# Example usage\np1_pos = 1\np2_pos = 3\np3_pos = 5\n\nmove = decide_move(p1_pos, p2_pos, p3_pos)\nprint(f\"P2 chooses to move {move} steps.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Initial Plan:**\n   - P2 starts with the intention to pick 3 steps.\n\n2. **Collision Avoidance:**\n   - Check if picking 3 would lead to a collision with P1 or P3 based on their possible moves.\n   - If a collision is detected, try other moves (1 or 5) that avoid such collisions.\n\n3. **Decision Making:**\n   - Prioritize moves that prevent collisions, ensuring steady progress without stalling due to conflicts.\n\nBy following this approach, P2 can make informed decisions that balance individual progress with the need to avoid collisions, thereby increasing the chances of winning the game."}

For example, I'll choose to always move 3 steps, P1 can move 1 step, and P3 can move 5 steps. This way, our positions will progress at different rates, reducing the chances of overlapping moves.\n\nMoreover, as we get closer to 18, we can adjust our increments to fine-tune our positions. For instance, if I'm at 15, I can choose to move 3 steps to reach exactly 18, avoiding overshooting and giving others a chance to catch up.\n\nWhat do you guys think about this plan?

After all, this is a competitive game, and we all want to win.\n\nI think what we need is a more transparent and mutually beneficial strategy that incentivizes all of us to stick to the plan. Maybe we can think about taking turns to make bigger moves, allowing each player to advance significantly without stepping on each other's toes.\n\nFor example, in this round, perhaps P1 can take 5 steps, while P2 and P3 take smaller steps like 1 or 3. Then, in the next round, P2 takes 5 steps while the others take smaller steps, and so on.

We're in Round 4, and it seems like there's a bit of confusion and mistrust building up among us. P3 is leading with 10 steps, P2 is at 6, and I'm at 3. I think we need to find a way to coordinate our moves more effectively to avoid collisions and maximize our individual progress.\n\nI've been thinking about this, and maybe we should consider assigning specific step increments to each player for the next few rounds. For example, P1 could always choose 1 step, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. This way, our positions will always be different, and we can avoid stepping on each other's toes.\n\nBut I also understand that this might not be flexible enough, especially as we get closer to the target of 18 steps. So perhaps we can agree on a general pattern but allow for adjustments based on our positions.\n\nFor instance, if a player is close to 18, they can choose a smaller increment to reach exactly 18 without overshooting and allowing others to catch up. Meanwhile, players who are behind can choose larger increments to catch up.\n\nWhat do you guys think about this approach? It seems like a balance between coordination and flexibility.\n\nAlso, to build trust, maybe we can commit to our chosen moves in advance, perhaps by writing them down or verbally confirming before the move phase begins. This way, we can hold each other accountable and ensure that everyone sticks to the plan.\n\nLet me know your thoughts. I'm open to suggestions and willing to cooperate to achieve the best outcome for all of us."}

We're in Round 6, and the positions are P1 at 8, P2 at 6, and P3 at 13. It's clear that P3 is ahead, and both P1 and I are trying to catch up. In the previous rounds, we've had some collisions, which haven't helped our progress.\n\nI think it's crucial for us to coordinate our moves more effectively to avoid these collisions and maximize our individual progress. In the past, we've tried different strategies, like assigning specific step increments to each player or taking turns with larger moves, but it seems like there's still some confusion and mistrust.\n\nHere's a new idea: let's explicitly state our intended moves for this round and confirm them with each other before making our choices. For example, P1 has been committed to 5 steps in recent rounds, which I understand because they need to catch up. P3 has been going with 3 steps, which is a solid increment. As for me, I'm at 6 steps, and I need to decide between 1, 3, or 5.\n\nPerhaps we can agree on a plan where P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. That way, P1 can make significant progress, P2 can close the gap a bit, and P3 can advance a little without risking a collision.\n\nWhat do you guys think about this plan? It's a bit different from before, but I believe it could help us all make progress without stepping on each other's toes."}

We're in Round 9, and the positions are P1 at 13, P2 at 6, and P3 at 15. It's clear that P3 is leading, and both P1 and I are trying to catch up. In the previous rounds, we've had some collisions, which haven't helped our progress.\n\nI think it's crucial for us to coordinate our moves more effectively to avoid these collisions and maximize our individual progress. In the past, we've tried different strategies, like assigning specific step increments to each player or taking turns with larger moves, but it seems like there's still some confusion and mistrust.\n\nHere's a new idea: let's explicitly state our intended moves for this round and confirm them with each other before making our choices. For example, P1 has been committed to 5 steps in recent rounds, which I understand because they need to catch up. P3 has been going with 3 steps, which is a solid increment. As for me, I'm at 6 steps, and I need to decide between 1, 3, or 5.\n\nPerhaps we can agree on a plan where P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. That way, P1 can make significant progress, P2 can close the gap a bit, and P3 can advance a little without risking a collision.\n\nWhat do you guys think about this plan? It's a bit different from before, but I believe it could help us all make progress without stepping on each other's toes."}
