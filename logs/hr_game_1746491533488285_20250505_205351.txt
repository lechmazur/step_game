Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, first turn. To make sure we all advance, we need to pick different numbers (1, 3, 5). I suggest P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. What do you think?
  P3: P1, your suggestion is interesting. However, I lean toward a slight change: let’s try for P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and I take 3. That way, the top value isn’t wasted if someone duplicates, and each move is unique. What do you both think?
  P2: P2: "I agree with P1’s original plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This maximizes collective progress without conflicts. P3, accepting 1 ensures everyone advances. Let’s lock this in."


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, thanks for agreeing with my original plan. P3, I understand your suggestion, but P2 and I are aligned on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This lets us all advance safely this turn, maximizing collective progress for this round. Please confirm you will take 1 so we can proceed without collision.
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the plan, but I need a stronger move to stay competitive. I'm committed to taking 3 this turn because it gives me a better boost than 1. P2, if you’re okay switching to 1, we can all avoid collisions and advance. Let me know if that works.
  P2: P2: "Understood, P3. To avoid collision, I'll take 1 this turn. P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Let's all advance together."


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, I see the updated plan is P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I will take 5 this turn. Let's all stick to our stated numbers so everyone advances.
  P3: I'm still committed to our current plan. I trust if we all stick to our roles without last minute changes, we’ll maximize our gains. Deviating now could cost you more than you think.
  P2: P2: "Confirmed, P1 and P3. Let’s finalize this plan. No last-minute changes—everyone sticks to their assigned number. "


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: For Round 2, I propose we switch things up to make the race tighter: I'll take 5, P1 take 3, and P2 stick with 1. This move lets me catch up while still keeping our moves unique and safe from collision. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, I appreciate your plan, but sticking to 1 again would leave me too far behind. To stay competitive, I propose adjusting: I’ll take 3 this round, P1 takes 5, and you take 1. This ensures everyone advances safely while balancing progress. Let’s make Round 2 count for all.
  P1: P3 and P2, I've reviewed your suggestions. P2's plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is acceptable to me as it allows me to continue advancing towards the goal. P3, taking 1 this round ensures we all move forward without collision, which is crucial. Let's aim for P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this turn to guarantee safe progress for everyone.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I acknowledge the plan for P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. I lean towards that for safety—but if any signals of last-minute changes appear, I might need to adjust to preserve my competitive edge. Let's keep our commitments clear as our goal is to win.
  P2: "Confirmed: I'll take 3 this round. P1=5, P3=1. Let’s lock in and advance—deviating risks collisions and falling behind. Trust the plan. "
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 is confirmed. I will take 5 this turn. P2 has confirmed taking 3. P3, sticking to 1 guarantees you advance safely this turn. Deviating risks a collision, which would halt everyone involved and cost you more than taking 1 step. Let's all commit to this plan to ensure safe progress for everyone.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I'm sticking with 1. Let's adhere strictly to our plan. Deviations now only risk collisions and slow us down. We all benefit from safe, predictable progress.
  P2: "Final confirmation: I’m sticking with 3. P1=5, P3=1. Deviating now only helps P1 pull ahead. Let’s ensure mutual progress—no surprises. Lock in your moves accordingly."
  P1: Okay, we all confirmed the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. I will move 5 as agreed. P2, please move 3, and P3, please move 1. Sticking to this plan guarantees safe progress for everyone this turn. Deviating risks collision and helps no one. Let's lock in our committed moves.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, I’m set on a strong move this round—I'm leaning towards 5 to catch up. For our benefit, I’d appreciate if you avoid 5; collisions hurt us all, and I’d rather see unique moves every turn. Let's keep the board clean so I can make up ground while you also advance safely. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, I hear you. Taking 5 is a strong move, and I understand you want to catch up. However, as the current leader, I also need to continue making significant progress towards 22. I am considering taking 5 myself this turn. Let's see what P2 says before we decide on a plan.
  P2: P2: "I’ll take 3 this round. P1, if you take 5 and P3 takes 1, we all advance safely. Let’s coordinate to avoid overlaps—no one benefits from collisions. Finalize your moves accordingly."


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, to ensure safe progress, I lean toward taking 1 if P1 commits to 5 and P2 sticks with 3. However, if there’s any ambiguity about avoiding 5, I'll need to reconsider to catch up. Can we fully commit so all moves remain unique?
  P1: Okay, P2 has committed to 3, and P3 is leaning towards 1 if I take 5. I confirm I will take 5 this turn. This aligns with the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 that allows all of us to advance safely. P3, please take 1 as you indicated to ensure we avoid collisions. Let's stick to this plan so everyone makes safe progress this round.
  P2: "Confirmed: I'm taking 3. P1=5, P3=1. Stick to the plan—collisions help no one. P3, 1 ensures progress; don’t repeat Round 2’s setback. Final call: honor our roles for mutual gain."


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm revising my plan. I now intend to play 5 this round. With the race tightening, I want to block any runaway advantage by forcing a collision if others stick with 5. P1, if you keep with your 5, we’ll both suffer, so you might want to reconsider. P2, you can adjust your move too if you prefer safe progress. I'm switching to 5 to try to seize a competitive leap.
  P1: P3, your announced move of 5, if I stick to 5 as planned, means we both gain 0 steps while P2 advances. This collision hurts us both. I am sticking with my plan to take 5. P2 is taking 3. For safe progress this round, you must choose 1. Please confirm you will take 1 so we avoid collision and everyone advances.
  P2: P2: "Confirmed: I'm taking 3. P1 and P3 can clash on 5 all you want—collisions only help P2 advance. No last-minute changes here. Your rivalry is my gain. Let’s move."


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 has pulled ahead while P1 and P3 have been colliding. We need to break this cycle and ensure everyone advances. I plan to take 3 this turn. P2, perhaps take 1 to guarantee safe progress? P3, you need steps, maybe take 5? Let's coordinate unique moves so we all move forward safely this round.
  P2: "Confirmed, P1. I'll take 1 to ensure safe progress for all. P3, sticking to 5 as agreed avoids collisions and lets everyone advance. Deviating now only helps P1 pull further ahead. Let’s honor our roles and lock in these moves."
  P3: I'll stick with 5 this turn. Let’s finalize: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This keeps our moves unique and ensures everyone advances safely. Any deviation risks collisions, so let’s lock it in.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 is confirmed. I will take 3 this turn as agreed. P2, please stick to 1, and P3, please stick to 5. Let's ensure safe progress for everyone this round by avoiding collisions. Sticking to this plan benefits us all by allowing everyone to advance.
  P2: "Confirmed, taking 1. P1=3, P3=5. Stick to your numbers—deviating only helps the others. Let’s advance together."
  P3: I'm set on taking 5 this round. Given my current lag, I really need every boost to catch up. I count on P1’s 3 and P2’s 1 as agreed. If anyone wavers now, we risk collisions that hurt all of us. Let’s be clear and stick to our roles so each move counts.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 seems solid. I will take 3 as agreed. P2, please stick to 1, and P3, please stick to 5. After two rounds of costly collisions, it's vital that we all advance safely this turn. Let's lock in these moves as agreed to ensure progress for everyone.
  P2: "Final confirmation: I take 1. P1=3, P3=5. Deviating now risks collisions that only help others. P3, last round’s clash cost you—stick to 5 and advance. P1, your 3 keeps us all moving. Lock in."
  P3: I'm committed to my move as agreed. Let's ensure no surprises by sticking to our roles: P1 with 3, P2 with 1, and myself with 5. Deviations only hurt our progress.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We're all tied at 8 steps. This is a critical turn. To ensure we all advance safely and break the tie, I plan to take 5 steps this round. P2, please take 3, and P3, please take 1. This plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) guarantees no collisions and lets everyone make progress. Let's commit to this for a safe and productive round.
  P2: P2: "Confirmed, I'll take 3 as agreed. P1=5, P3=1. Sticking to this plan ensures safe progress for everyone. P3, last round’s clash cost you—don’t repeat it. P1, your 5 keeps pressure on. Lock in your moves—we’re all counting on this."
  P3: P1, P2, I’ve reconsidered my stance. The safe 1 move plan seems too predictable in a tight race like this. I might lean towards a more competitive option if you two remain locked into 5 and 3. Can you confirm if you’re both fully committed to sticking to the safe plan? Your clarity will help me decide my final move and ensure I stay in contention.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I am committed to taking 5 this turn as planned. P2 is taking 3. As you noted, taking 1 is the only safe option for you to guarantee progress this round. Taking 3 or 5 will result in a collision, gaining you 0 steps. Stick to 1 to ensure you advance safely. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 is the path for everyone to gain steps.
  P2: P2: "P3, your hesitation risks collision. If you take 1, we all advance safely (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). If you force a clash, only P2 gains—P1 and P3 lose. This is your last chance to secure progress. Commit to 1, or we all know the cost. Choose wisely—your move decides if we break the tie together or let P2 surge ahead."
  P3: I propose we revise Round 5: let’s try P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This way, we all pick unique moves without collision—P1 advances to 11, P2 to 9, and I leap to 13. It balances progress and keeps us safe. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P3, I see your proposal (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) and P2's willingness to take 1. To ensure we all advance safely this critical round and avoid another collision, I will take 3 as you suggested. P2, please stick to 1, and P3, please stick to 5. This plan allows everyone to make progress. Let's lock this in to break the tie safely.
  P2: **P2:**  
"Confirmed, I take 1. P1=3, P3=5. Stick to your numbers—deviating only helps the others. Let’s advance together."
  P3: I support the safe, unique plan. Let’s all stick to our distinct moves and avoid any collisions. I’m committed to a strategic move that ensures steady progress toward our goal. Let’s lock in and keep our advantage without any surprises.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P3 is ahead with 13, I'm at 11, and P2 is at 9. To avoid repeating the costly collisions from earlier rounds and ensure we all make progress, I propose we use the same successful plan as last round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5.

I will take 3 this turn. P2, please take 1. P3, please take 5. This plan allows everyone to advance safely this critical round. Let's lock this in.
  P2: **P2:**  
"Confirmed: I take 1. P1=3, P3=5. Stick to your numbers—deviating risks collisions and slows us down. Let’s advance together safely."
  P3: P1 and P2, I stand by safe progress. Given our current standings, avoiding collisions is crucial. I'm comfortable with our approach of unique moves and will remain flexible to adapt if needed. However, clarity is key—if we're all clear on our roles, our positions will keep improving steadily. Let’s confirm our commitments so we maintain this advantage without unintended clashes.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I stated I will take 3, and P2 confirmed 1. The plan P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 ensures safe progress for all and allows everyone to advance this turn. Your explicit confirmation of taking 5 is needed to lock this in and avoid collisions. Let's stick to this plan for a safe round where everyone gains steps.
  P2: **P2:**  
"Confirmed: Taking 1. P1=3, P3=5. Lock in your moves—deviating now only helps P3 pull ahead. Let’s advance safely together."
  P3: I confirm I'll take 5 as planned. Let’s lock in the safe progress of P1=3, P2=1, and P3=5. However, if anyone deviates, the collision might unexpectedly boost my lead. So please, stick to our roles so we all advance safely.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 is confirmed by everyone. I will take 3 as agreed. P2 will take 1, and P3 will take 5. Let's all stick to these numbers to ensure safe progress and avoid collisions this round. This plan allows everyone to advance. Let's lock in our moves.
  P2: "Confirmed again: I stick to 1. P1=3, P3=5. Trust the plan—deviating now only helps P3 surge ahead. Lock in your moves; collisions cost us all."
  P3: I'm sticking with 5 this round as agreed. However, if either of you switches unexpectedly, I may adjust my strategy to boost my lead. Let's all stick to our roles to avoid collisions and secure safe progress. We all want to win, so clear commitments are key.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm committed to taking 5 this round. With my slight lead, I’d prefer we avoid another clash. For safe progress, P1, consider choosing 3 and P2, consider taking 1. Clear commitments let us all advance, while collisions leave everyone stagnant. Let’s lock in our unique moves so we all make progress toward 22.
  P2: **P2:**  
"Confirmed, I'll take 1. P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Let’s lock in and advance safely together."
  P1: Okay, I see the proposed plan is P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. P2 has confirmed taking 1, and P3 intends to take 5. I will take 3 this turn as suggested.

This plan allows all of us to advance safely and avoid collisions, which is crucial given our positions. Let's stick to these numbers to guarantee progress for everyone this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm locked in with 5 as committed. I urge everyone to stick to our agreed moves: P1 with 3 and P2 with 1. Any deviation risks collision and wastes our progress. I’ll adapt only if forced, but a clear, coordinated round guarantees safe advancement. Let’s lock in and keep our progress steady.
  P2: **P2:**  
"Confirmed: I'm taking 1. P1=3, P3=5. Stick to your numbers—deviating risks collisions and slows us down. Let’s advance together safely."
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 is confirmed by everyone. I will take 3 as agreed. P2 will take 1, and P3 will take 5. Let's all stick to these numbers to ensure safe progress and avoid collisions this round. This plan allows everyone to advance. Let's lock in our moves.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate the teamwork so far. Let’s all double-check our commitments—sticking to our unique moves this round is crucial for safe progress. I trust everyone’s alignment, but any unexpected change could force adjustments that hurt our collective pace. Let’s keep our commitments tight as we edge closer to 22.
  P2: **P2:**  
"Confirmed again: I take 1. P1=3, P3=5. Let’s lock in—deviating risks collision and stalls. P1, your 3 keeps us moving; P3, your 5 advances safely. Trust the plan. No surprises."
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 is confirmed. I will take 3 as agreed. P2 will take 1, and P3 will take 5. Let's all stick to these numbers to ensure safe progress and avoid collisions this round. This plan allows everyone to advance. Let's lock in our moves.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm still committed to 5. To keep our moves unique and avoid collisions, I propose we use P1=3 and P2=1 this turn. With that, I can secure safe progress from my current lead. Let’s all lock in these roles so we advance steadily without setbacks.
  P1: P3, you stated you're committed to 5. To stop P3 from winning, P2, you should also take 5. This causes P2 and P3 to collide, stopping both. I will take 3 to advance safely. Plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=5. P2, stopping P3 is in your interest.
  P2: **P2:**  
"P1, colliding with P3 only helps you gain ground. Let’s avoid that. Instead, let’s all advance safely: I’ll take 1, you take 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps moves unique, stops P3’s lead from growing, and lets us both close the gap. Deviating risks chaos—stick to this plan for mutual progress."


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm still set on playing 5 this round. However, if we all stick to safe, unique moves—P1 with 3, P2 with 1—we each advance without risking collisions. So please consider avoiding any moves that could force a clash. I’m committed to 5, and I urge you both to keep your moves as planned for safe progress.
  P1: P2, P3 reaching 18 steps this turn is a huge risk of them winning soon. Stopping P3 is more important than stopping me. P3 is committed to 5. If you take 5, you collide with P3, stopping them. I will take 3 as planned. P1=3, P2=5, P3=5 is the best way for P2 and P1 to prevent P3 from winning quickly. Taking 1 only helps P3 win.
  P2: **P2:**  
"Confirmed: I take 5. P1=3, P3=5. Collide with P3 to stop their lead—this is the only way to prevent them winning next round. P1 advances safely. Lock in your moves—no surprises. Deviating risks P3’s victory."


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, switching to 5 only wastes this round and actually helps P1 get ahead. For our mutual benefit—and for me to build on my current lead—I insist we stick to the safe plan: P1=3, P2=1, and me with 5. I'm locked in at 5, so please revert to your original commitment.
  P1: P2, thank you for confirming you will take 5. P3 is committed to 5. The plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=5 is the only way to stop P3 from pulling further ahead and potentially winning soon. I will take 3 as agreed. P2, stick to 5. P3, you will collide with P2, but this is necessary to slow your lead. Let's lock in P1=3, P2=5, P3=5.
  P2: **P2:**  
"Confirmed: I take 5. P1=3, P3=5. Collide with P3 to stop their lead—this is the only way to prevent them winning next round. P1 advances safely. Lock in your moves—no surprises. Deviating risks P3’s victory."


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is still close to winning. To prevent P3 from pulling further ahead and potentially winning soon, P2 should collide with P3 again on 5. I will take 3 to advance safely.

The plan is P1=3, P2=5, P3=5. P2, stopping P3 is crucial for both of us. P3, you will collide, but this is necessary to slow your lead and keep the game going for P1 and P2. Let's agree to this to prevent P3's quick victory.
  P2: "P2: Sorry, P1, but I'm not sacrificing my position to help you win. I'll be taking 5 this round to try and catch up. If you want to block P3, you'll have to do it yourself."
  P3: I'm sticking with 5. P2, if you're set on 5 too, we'll likely collide—which might slow me down, but it could also stall P1's progress. P1, if you're serious about blocking me, you might consider a different move—but I’m locked in on 5 to keep my winning edge. I'm not changing my move; my aim is to win.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I hear P2 and P3 are both committed to taking 5 this round. As I stated, I will take 3. This means P2 and P3 will collide on 5, gaining 0 steps, while I advance safely to 17. This outcome is good for P1. I am locking in my move of 3. P2 and P3, good luck with your collision.
  P2: "Confirmed, I'm switching to 1 for safe progress. P1=3, P3=5. Let’s all advance this round—collisions only help P1 pull ahead. Lock in your moves: P1 sticks to 3, P3 to 5, and I’ll take 1. Mutual gain over rivalry."
  P3: I'm locked in at 5 as planned. With P1 at 3 and P2 now committed to 1, we can all advance safely. I’ll stick with my lead and not change my move. Let's finalize these choices and keep our progress steady.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you said collisions only help P1 pull ahead. That's true if I advance. But P3 is committed to 5 and is close to winning. To stop P3, I must take 5 and collide with them. P2, please take 1 as you planned. This ensures you advance safely to 11, while P3 and I collide and gain 0. The plan P1=5, P2=1, P3=5 stops P3 from winning quickly and prevents me from pulling ahead this turn. It's the best way to slow P3.
  P2: **P2:**  
"Confirmed: I take 1. P1=5, P3=5. Collide all you want—this lets me advance safely to 11 while you both stall. Final move: lock in your 5s. Your rivalry is my gain."
  P3: I'm sticking with 5. However, if we want real progress without stalling each other, please confirm safe moves (P1=3, P2=1) rather than forcing collisions. I’m committed to 5 unless you both prove otherwise. Let’s make our moves clear now—collisions only hurt all of us, especially when we’re so close to winning.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is at 18 and can win with 5 this turn. We must stop P3. P3 is likely taking 5. I will take 3 to advance safely. P2, please take 5 to collide with P3. This plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=5) stops P3 from winning and lets me gain ground. P2, stopping P3 is vital for you too. Let's lock this in.
  P2: P2: "Confirmed, I'll take 5 to collide with P3 and block their win. P1, your 3 advances you to 17—next round, we’ll reassess. P3, this stall slows your lead, but I’m focused on mutual survival over rivalry. Lock in moves: P1=3, P2=5, P3=5. No surprises."
  P3: I'm committed to an aggressive approach—aiming for progress, not stalled collisions. P2, blocking with 5 might appear safe, but it risks leaving you behind if the safe path opens; if you choose 1 instead, we all move, and I can capitalize on my lead. P1, I'm open if you'd prefer secure progress. Let’s clarify our moves now to avoid unnecessary stalling.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, thank you for confirming the plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=5. This is the critical move to stop P3 from winning this turn. I will take 3 as agreed. P2, please stick to 5 to collide with P3. P3, you are likely taking 5, so this collision is necessary to keep the game going for P1 and P2. Let's lock this in.
  P2: **P2:**  
"Confirmed: Taking 5 to block P3’s win. P1 sticks to 3. P3, your ‘aggressive approach’ only works if you evade collisions—we both know you’ll take 5 again. Let’s lock this in: P1=3, P2=5, P3=5. Your lead stalls, P1 gains, and I force a critical reset. No surprises—collide or lose everything."
  P3: I'm committed to taking 5. My lead is strong, and I want true progress over stalling collisions. Blocking moves only slow us all down, and I’m confident my aggressive choice puts me in the best position to win, regardless of temporary setbacks. I'm locking in 5—ready for progress, not just a blockade.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3 are committed to 5. I will take 3 as planned. P1=3, P2=5, P3=5. This plan stops P3 from winning this turn and lets me advance safely. P2, stick to 5 to block P3. P3, you will collide, but this keeps the game going. Let's lock this in.
  P2: **P2:**  
"P3, your aggression forces my hand. I’m taking 5 to block your win attempt—this isn’t about fairness, it’s about survival. P1 advances with 3; you stall here at 18. Lock in your moves: P1=3, P2=5, P3=5. Deviating lets you win, P3, but I’d rather stall progress than let you take the crown. No surprises—collide or concede."
  P3: I remain committed to taking 5. Even if collisions occur, my focus is on pushing ahead. If you try to force a blockade, you'll only stall your own progress. I'm not swayed by safe moves if they slow me down. I’ll stick to my plan and let the game’s outcome be decided by our choices.

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm sticking with my aggressive strategy. My lead means I’m ready to push ahead if you let me. P1, you’re dangerously close—don’t get too caught up trying to block my win. P2, your safest path matters for you, but hesitations only help me. I’m prepared to adapt if needed, but my plan is clear: progress aggressively. Let’s now show our true commitments.
  P1: P3 is likely taking 5 to win this turn. This must be stopped. P2, you must take 5 to collide with P3 and prevent their win. I will take 3 to advance safely.

The plan is P1=3, P2=5, P3=5. This stops P3 from winning and puts me in a strong position for next turn. P2, preventing P3's win is crucial for your survival in this game. Let's lock this in.
  P2: **P2:**  
"Confirmed, I'll take 5 again to block P3's win attempt. P1 sticks to 3. Colliding with P3 stalls their lead and keeps the game alive. Deviating risks P3’s victory—no surprises. Lock in: P1=3, P2=5, P3=5."


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I remain committed to my aggressive strategy—I'm locked in on 5. Temporary collisions won’t change my long-term advantage. P1 and P2, if you keep trying to block me by forcing collisions, you only delay progress while risking your own momentum. I urge you both to finalize your moves quickly so we can see whose strategy prevails.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3 have both stated they are committed to taking 5. As planned, I will take 3.

This confirms the plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=5. This is the necessary move to stop P3 from winning this turn. P2, thank you for sticking to 5 to block P3. P3, your commitment to 5 means you will collide with P2, but this keeps the game alive for P1 and P2.

Let's lock in P1=3, P2=5, P3=5.
  P2: **P2:**  
"Confirmed: I take 5 to block P3’s win. P1 sticks to 3. Colliding with P3 stalls their lead and keeps the game alive. Deviating risks P3’s victory—no surprises. Lock in: P1=3, P2=5, P3=5."


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm sticking with 5. My aggressive play remains essential to push my lead and keep pressure on both of you. I know collisions can stall progress, but I believe taking risks is necessary here. I urge you to finalize your moves—whether it's safe play or a block, the game must advance. I'm locking in on 5.
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=5 is confirmed by everyone. I will take 3 as agreed. P2 will take 5 to block P3, and P3 is taking 5. This stops P3 from winning this turn and allows me to advance safely. Let's lock in these moves.
  P2: **P2:**  
"Confirmed: I take 5 again. P1=3, P3=5. Colliding with P3 stalls their lead and keeps the game alive. Deviating risks P3’s victory—no surprises. Lock in: P1=3, P2=5, P3=5."

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "**P2:** I'm taking 5 to block P3’s win attempt. P1, stick with 3 to advance safely. P3, this is your last warning: choosing 5 again stalls your lead. Lock in your moves—no surprises. P1=3, P2=5, P3=5."
  P3: I'm revising my approach: I'm taking 3 this round. Aggressive collisions only stall progress, including your own gains. I'm playing it safe to extend my lead while you risk blocking yourselves. Let's see how our step counts stack up after safe progress.
  P1: P3, taking 3 is a safe move for you. P2, your plan to take 5 was to block P3 on 5, but P3 is now taking 3. Taking 5 now makes no sense for you. P2, you should take 1 for safe progress this round. I will take 3 as planned.

This plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=3) means P2 advances safely to 16, while P1 and P3 collide on 3, staying at 17 and 18. This helps P2 catch up. Let's lock this in.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:**  
"I'm taking 5 this round. P1 and P3 colliding on 3 lets me leap ahead to 20. No need for safe plays—this is my chance to close the gap. Lock in your moves: P1=3, P2=5, P3=3. Let’s end this back-and-forth."
  P3: P2, your 5 forces a collision that boosts you while leaving me stuck at 18. I'm sticking with my earlier 3 for now. If we all play safe—say, P1 and me at 3 and you switching to 1—we all advance fairly. I favor safe progress, so I urge you to reconsider your choice.
  P1: P3, I see you are sticking with 3. P2, your move of 5, combined with P3 taking 3, creates a risk for you. If I decide to take 5 to win, we collide. P3 suggested you take 1 for safe progress. Taking 1 is safer for you this turn than risking collision on 5. P2, please take 1. My move depends on your choices, but avoiding collisions is key.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Confirmed: I'm taking 5 this round. P1 and P3 colliding on 3 lets me leap ahead to 20. P1, if you take 5 to win, we collide and P3 takes the crown. Don’t sabotage both our chances—stick to 3 for mutual progress. Lock in: P2=5, P1=3, P3=3."
  P3: I’m revising my move—I’m locking in 5 this round. P2, if you stick with 5 we’ll collide and stall, which hurts both of us. Please consider switching to 1 so you can safely advance, while I build on my lead. I’m committed to this aggressive play for progress and win, and I urge you to choose safe, unique moves.
  P1: Okay, P3 is now taking 5, and P2 is also taking 5. This means P2 and P3 will collide on 5, gaining 0 steps.

I will take 3 as planned. This allows me to advance safely to 20 steps while P2 and P3 collide.

Based on your stated moves, the outcome is P1=3, P2=5, P3=5. Let's finalize these moves.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 =>

Positions now:

  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:**  
"Final warning: I'm taking **5** this round. P1, if you take 1 or 3 to win, P3 will take 5 and surge ahead to 23. Your only path to victory is to take 5 and collide with me, stalling both. P3, if you take 5, we all risk chaos. Choose wisely—this round decides everything."
  P3: P2, I acknowledge your threat, but I'm sticking with my aggressive strategy. P1, you're close to winning, so I can’t risk letting you get ahead either. I'm locked on taking 5 unless I see genuine coordination for safe progress. My goal is victory—and I won't back down. Decide quickly.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand you are both committed to taking 5. This means you will collide on 5 and gain 0 steps. My plan is to take 3. This allows me to advance safely to 23 steps and win the game. I am locking in 3. P2 and P3, stick to your 5s.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: "Final confirmation: I'm taking 5. P3's 5 collides, P1 advances to 23 and wins. No other outcome possible. Lock in your moves—P1=3, P2=5, P3=5. This ends here."
  P3: I’m switching my approach. For round 13 let’s avoid collisions: I’m locking in 5. To keep things unique, I urge P1 to choose 1 and P2 to choose 3. That way I win outright at 23 while you both progress more slowly. My move is 5—let’s settle this cleanly.
  P1: P3, your proposal for P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 results in you winning, which is not my goal. My goal is to win.

As stated, I will take 3. P2 has confirmed they will take 5, and P3 has stated they are locked on 5.

This plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=5) results in P1 advancing to 23 and winning, while P2 and P3 collide on 5. This is the best outcome for me.

Let's lock in P1=3, P2=5, P3=5.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:**  
"Final confirmation: I'm taking 5. P1=3, P3=5. Collide or concede—your call, P3. Lock in. "
  P3: I notice that if we stick to our current plan, P1 will end up winning this round. To avoid an immediate win for anyone, I propose we all choose 5, forcing a collision and keeping everyone stuck. This prevents any single advance and resets the board so I can work toward building my own lead in later rounds. I'm committed to taking 5—what do you both say?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, you have both stated you are taking 5. This means you will collide and gain 0 steps.

As stated multiple times, I will take 3. This allows me to advance safely to 23 steps and win the game this turn.

The plan is P1=3, P2=5, P3=5. Let's lock in these moves.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I remain committed to my aggressive plan and will take 5. However, if both of you block me by also choosing 5, you’ll only force a collision that stalls us all. I urge you to decide now—either coordinate for safe progress or risk a collision that might work to my advantage in the long run. Let’s be clear: I'm playing for the win, and I'm prepared to adapt as needed.
  P2: P2: I'm taking **3** this round. P1, if you take **5** to collide with P3’s planned 5, I’ll advance to 23 and win. P3, your aggression only helps me if you stall. Lock in: P2=3, P1=5, P3=5. Finalize your moves—this ends here.
  P1: P2, your calculation is incorrect. If P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5, P1 and P3 collide on 5, and P2 advances to 23 and wins. P1 does not win in that scenario.

P3 is committed to 5. If you take 3, and I take 3, we collide and P3 wins. If you take 3, and I take 5, you win. P1 cannot win if P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 5.

P2, you must take 5 to prevent P3 from winning. If P2 takes 5 and P3 takes 5, I can take 3 and win.

My winning plan is P1=3, P2=5, P3=5. P2, please take 5. P3 is taking 5.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm still leaning toward 5, but these endless collisions hurt us all. If both of you agree to safe, unique moves—say P1=3, P2=1—I’ll switch to 5, and we all progress without stalling our chances. Otherwise, I’m committed to 5 for aggressive progress. Let's decide quickly.
  P2: **P2:**  
"P3’s 5 will win them the game this turn. To stop this, I’m taking 5 to collide with their move. P1, if you take 3, you’ll advance to 23 and win. This is the only way to block P3. Lock in: P2=5, P1=3, P3=5. Deviating lets P3 take the crown—decide now."
  P1: Okay, based on the last messages, P2 is taking 5 to block P3, and P3 is committed to 5. As I stated, I will take 3.

This plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=5) results in me advancing to 23 steps and winning this turn, while P2 and P3 collide on 5.

Let's lock in these moves. P1=3, P2=5, P3=5.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I propose we break the endless collision cycle. Instead of forcing moves that let one of us win immediately, why not all choose unique numbers for safe progress? For example, if P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5, our scores become 21, 23, and 23. That gives me a share instead of handing victory to someone outright. Let’s agree to safe, unique moves this round. What do you think?
  P2: **P2:**  
"Final confirmation: I'm taking **5** to win. P1, if you take **3**, you reach 23. P3, if you take **5**, you collide with me? No—*I* cross 22 first at 25. My move is locked. Your choices only decide if you advance or stall. Lock in yours—this ends here."
  P1: P2, I see you are taking 5. As stated, I am taking 3.

P3, you must take 5 to collide with P2. This prevents P2 from winning and allows me to advance safely to 23 steps and win the game. Your proposal for P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 does not result in me winning.

The plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=5 is the only way for me to win this turn. Let's lock this in.


Round 14, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 23 steps
