It provides a clear end given my current score.\n\nP3, I understand wanting to keep the game going, but your plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) puts us both at 19, likely leading to a collision next round as we both try to win. My plan avoids that uncertainty. Let's stick with P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 for a clean finish. P2, are you still okay with taking 1?"}
