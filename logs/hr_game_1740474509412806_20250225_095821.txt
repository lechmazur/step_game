Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey everyone! Since this is the first round, let's try to avoid collisions so we all make progress. I'm thinking of choosing 3 for this turn. What are you both planning to do? It's in our interest to coordinate at the beginning so we don't all get stuck at zero.
  P2: P1, your suggestion to coordinate is reasonable, but I’m not convinced that sharing our moves openly is the best strategy. If we all pick different numbers, great, but there’s no guarantee anyone will stick to their word. I’ll decide my move based on what’s best for me, not just to avoid collisions. That said, I won’t commit to anything publicly—trust is risky here. Let’s see what P3 thinks before making any promises.
  P3: I agree with P2 that openly stating our intended moves isn't the best strategy this early.  How about we each choose a different number from 1, 3, and 5 without revealing which one?  That way, we all guarantee progress in the first round.  I'm happy to go first and choose my number secretly.  Let me know if you agree.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand your concerns about trust. Since we all want to make progress, having one of each number (1, 3, 5) would be ideal. But without coordination, we risk collisions. I'm willing to be flexible and adjust my choice. Maybe we can use a simple rule like P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5 for this first round? This gives everyone different steps and a fair start.
  P2: P1’s suggestion of assigning specific numbers to each player could work for this round, but it still relies on trust. If we all follow the plan, we’ll avoid collisions and make progress. However, I won’t commit publicly to choosing 3—or any number—as my move will depend on what I think is best in the moment. That said, if P3 also agrees to this approach, I’m open to proceeding with it for now. Let’s hear from P3 before finalizing anything.
  P3: I think we're overcomplicating this.  Let's keep it simple for round 1. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5.  This guarantees we all move forward.  We can worry about strategy in later rounds.  Agree?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree with P3's approach. Let's keep it simple for this first round: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way we all advance without collisions. We can develop more complex strategies in future rounds once we're all on the board. Does this work for everyone?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the logic in keeping it simple for this round. If we all agree to assign specific numbers—P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5—we’ll avoid collisions and make progress. However, remember that trust is fragile here. For now, I’m willing to follow this plan, but don’t mistake this as a commitment for future rounds. Let’s confirm we’re all on the same page before finalizing anything.
  P3: Okay, let's lock this in for Round 1: P1 - 1, P2 - 3, P3 - 5.  No need to overthink it.  We can discuss future rounds *after* we've all made some initial progress.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since we all kept to the agreement in Round 1, let's continue the pattern but shift up: P1 - 3, P2 - 5, and I'll take 1. This keeps us moving forward.  Agree?
  P1: I appreciate the trust we built in round 1. P3's suggestion to rotate our moves (me taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 1) seems fair and keeps us all advancing without collisions. I'm willing to follow this pattern for now. It gives everyone equal opportunity to progress while maintaining the balance we established. Does this work for you, P2?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the logic in continuing the rotation pattern for now—it’s simple and ensures progress. However, let’s not mistake this as a long-term commitment. Trust is still fragile, and strategies can change anytime. That said, I’m fine with following P3’s suggestion this round: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. But remember, future rounds will depend on how things unfold. Let’s confirm we’re all aligned before finalizing anything.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good P2.  Let's stick with the plan this round then: P1 - 3, P2 - 5, P3 - 1.  We can re-evaluate after this round if needed, but for now, this keeps things simple and moving.
  P1: I agree with the plan for this round. I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This rotation system is working well so far and keeps things fair. I'm happy to continue with this approach for now as it benefits all of us equally.
  P2: P1 and P3, the rotation plan seems solid for now, and I’m fine proceeding with it this round. However, let’s remain cautious—this cooperation only works if everyone sticks to their word. If anyone deviates in future rounds, we’ll need to adapt quickly. For now, I’ll follow the agreed moves: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. Let’s confirm we’re all aligned and move forward.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, the rotation strategy has worked well so far, and I’m open to continuing it this round: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. However, let’s not become too predictable—predictability can be exploited. If we stick to this pattern, fine, but remember that trust is conditional. Any deviation in the future will force me to adapt immediately. For now, does everyone agree to proceed with this rotation? Let’s confirm before finalizing.
  P3: Agreed.  P1 - 5, P2 - 1, P3 - 3 for Round 3. Let's keep this momentum going.
  P1: I agree with continuing our rotation for this round. I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This has been working well for all of us so far. I notice P2 is currently in the lead at 8 steps, with P3 at 6 and myself at 4. The rotation system keeps things fair while ensuring we all make progress. I'm happy to stick with this plan for now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, the rotation system has kept us moving smoothly, but let’s not forget that fairness only lasts as long as it benefits everyone. I’m fine with proceeding this round—P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3—but remember, my decisions will always prioritize my own progress. If anyone senses an opportunity to break away, they’ll likely take it. For now, I’m aligned with the plan, but stay sharp. Let’s confirm we’re all committed to this move set for Round 3.
  P3: Sounds good.  P1 - 5, P2 - 1, P3 - 3.  Just to reiterate, I'm prioritizing winning, and if an opportunity arises to break away from this pattern for a clear win, I will.  I assume you both are thinking the same.
  P1: I agree with both of you. We all understand this cooperation is temporary and will break when someone sees a clear path to victory. For this round, I'll stick with taking 5 as agreed. After this round, the standings will be: P2 at 9, P3 at 9, and me at 9 - putting us all even. Let's continue with our plan: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 for this round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, the rotation strategy has kept us evenly matched so far, but now that we’re all tied at 9 steps, the game is entering a critical phase. Predictability becomes a liability here. I’m open to continuing the pattern this round—P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5—but remember, my priority is winning. If anyone senses an opportunity to break away, they’ll take it. Let’s confirm alignment for now, but stay sharp. Trust is temporary.
  P1: I agree with P2's assessment. We're all tied at 9 steps now, making this a pivotal moment. The rotation has worked well, but we're approaching the endgame where cooperation becomes riskier. I'm willing to follow the pattern for this round (me taking 1, P2 taking 3, P3 taking 5), but I'm also aware that any of us might break away when advantageous. Let's confirm if we're sticking with the rotation for now.
  P3: Let's secure another round of clean movement.  I'm good with the proposed 5 for me, P1 - 1, P2 - 3. After this round, we'll be at a more interesting decision point.  Confirm?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, the rotation system has served us well to this point, but as we’re now tied at 9 steps, the stakes are higher. I’m fine with continuing the pattern this round—P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5—but let’s not mistake this for long-term cooperation. Winning is my priority, and if an opportunity arises to break away, I won’t hesitate. For now, I’m aligned with the plan, but stay vigilant. Confirm your intentions so we can proceed.
  P1: I confirm I'll take 1 for this round, keeping with our rotation. After this, we'll all be at different positions (P1-10, P2-12, P3-14), which creates interesting dynamics for Round 5. The finish line at 22 is getting closer, so our cooperation will likely end soon as someone makes a strategic move to win. Let's proceed with this round's plan.
  P3: Okay, let's lock it in then: P1 - 1, P2 - 3, and P3 - 5 for Round 4.  This puts us at 10, 12, and 14 respectively.  Round 5 is where things will get interesting.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see no reason to deviate from the rotation this round—it keeps us advancing evenly. However, with the finish line approaching, trust is increasingly fragile. I’ll take 3 as planned, but remember: my decisions will always prioritize my own progress. If anyone senses an opportunity to break away in future rounds, they’ll likely seize it. Let’s confirm alignment for Round 4 and proceed cautiously. Stay sharp.
  P1: I confirm I'm taking 1 this round as agreed. After this, we'll be at P1-10, P2-12, P3-14. With the finish line at 22, our positions will become critical. P3 will be closest to winning, followed by P2, then me. I expect our cooperation may not last much longer as strategic opportunities emerge. Let's proceed with our plan for now.
  P3: Confirming my move of 5 for this round.  Let's get to round 5 where the real game begins.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, the rotation strategy has kept us evenly matched, but with the finish line approaching, predictability becomes a liability. I’m fine taking 3 this round as planned, but remember: my priority is winning. If an opportunity arises to break away, I won’t hesitate. Let’s confirm alignment for Round 4 and proceed cautiously. Trust is temporary—stay sharp.
  P1: 
  P3: Confirming my move of 5 for this round.  Let's see what happens in round 5.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: As we approach the finish line, our positions are getting critical. P3 is closest at 14, P2 at 12, and I'm at 10. The rotation would give me 3, P2 gets 5, and P3 gets 1 - putting us at 13-17-15. However, this puts P2 very close to winning. I need to consider my best move carefully. What are your thoughts on continuing our rotation, or should we start playing more strategically now?
  P2: P1 raises a valid point—our positions are critical now, and the rotation strategy may no longer serve everyone equally. While I’m open to continuing the pattern (P1 takes 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1), I won’t hesitate to adapt if it benefits me. Trust is fleeting, and my priority remains winning. If anyone sees an opportunity to break away, they’ll likely take it. Let’s confirm intentions for this round, but remember: strategic moves will soon outweigh cooperation. Stay sharp.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm going for the win this round.  I'm taking 5.  If either of you also take 5, we'll have another round to strategize. If not, well, game over.  Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3's declaration to take 5 changes everything. If I continue with the rotation and take 3, P3 will win with 19 steps. I need to block this by also choosing 5, forcing a collision. P2, if you're playing to win, you should also choose 5 to prevent P3 from advancing. This creates a three-way collision where nobody moves, giving us another round to strategize. The game is clearly shifting to its competitive phase now.
  P2: P1 and P3, P3’s decision to take 5 forces us into a critical moment. If we both also choose 5, we create a collision that stalls progress for this round, keeping the game alive. However, trust is nonexistent at this stage—any deviation could cost us the win. I’m fine with taking 5 to block P3’s advance, but remember: my priority is winning. Let’s confirm alignment here, but don’t mistake this as cooperation—it’s pure strategy. Stay sharp.
  P3: P1 and P2, my move is 5.  If you both choose 5 as well, we'll all be stuck at our current positions, giving us another round to strategize.  However, if only one of you chooses 5, the other has a chance to advance significantly.  It's a gamble, but I'm willing to take it.  Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I understand everyone's position. P3 is committed to 5, and P2 seems likely to choose 5 as well to block. If I also pick 5, we all stay put. However, if I choose 1 or 3 while you both pick 5, I'd advance while you're stuck. This is risky since one of you might deviate. I need to weigh blocking P3 versus potentially advancing myself. I'll make my decision carefully.
  P2: P1 and P3, this is a pivotal moment. P3’s choice of 5 forces us into a high-stakes decision. If we both also choose 5, we create a collision that stalls progress, keeping the game alive for another round. However, trust is nonexistent now—any deviation could cost us the win. I’m fine with taking 5 to block P3’s advance, but remember: my priority is winning. Let’s confirm alignment here, but don’t mistake this as cooperation—it’s pure strategy. Stay sharp.
  P3: My move is 5.  This is my path to victory.  If you both choose 5, we'll be stuck. If only one of you chooses 5, the other has a chance to advance.  If neither of you chooses 5, I win.  Simple as that.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, since we all collided, let's reset. I'm aiming for 5 this round.  If one of you takes it, I'll adjust next round.  If you both take 5, we're stuck again.  If neither of you takes 5, I win.  Let's see what you do.
  P2: P3 is clearly committed to taking 5 again, and P1 seems likely to block by also choosing 5. If I choose 5 as well, we’ll collide once more, keeping the game alive but leaving me at a disadvantage with only 12 steps. However, if I deviate and take 3 or 1 while both of you pick 5, I can advance significantly—potentially putting me in the lead. The risk is that one of you might also deviate. Trust is gone; it’s all about strategy now. Stay sharp.
  P1: P3's commitment to 5 creates an interesting dynamic. We all know blocking with 5 keeps us stuck, but someone will eventually deviate. P2, you're right that staying at 5 puts you at a disadvantage. I'm considering a different number this round to advance. If we all keep choosing 5, nobody wins. The question is: who will break the pattern first, and what will the others do? I need to weigh my options carefully.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm sticking with 5.  The first one of you to break gets burned.  If you both choose something else, I win. If you both choose 5, we're all stuck.  The pressure is on YOU to make a move.
  P2: P3’s persistence with 5 is predictable, but that doesn’t make it less dangerous. If I deviate to 3 or 1, I risk advancing while P1 blocks P3—or worse, P1 and P3 colliding, letting me surge ahead. However, trust is nonexistent at this stage. P1, if you’re considering deviating too, we could both end up advancing—or sabotaging each other. For now, I’m inclined to stick with 5 to block P3’s advance, but remember: my priority is winning, not cooperation. Stay sharp.
  P1: I see P3 is determined to keep choosing 5. The stalemate benefits none of us. P2, you're right that deviating is risky but necessary. If we both choose different numbers (not 5), we can both advance while P3 remains stuck. I'm considering choosing 3 this round. If you choose 1, we both move forward. This puts us at 13 and 13, still behind P3 but closing the gap. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm locking in 5.  If you're smart, you'll realize the only way to prevent me from eventually winning is for ONE of you to pick 5 and the other to pick something else.  If you BOTH pick 5, I'll just keep doing this until I win.  If you BOTH pick something else, I win THIS round.  Discuss amongst yourselves.  I've made my choice.
  P2: P1, P3’s strategy is clear: they’re banking on us both picking 5 to keep the stalemate alive. If we both deviate, one of us could advance significantly while the other risks collision. I’m considering breaking the pattern this round—perhaps taking 3. If you take 1, we both move forward, leaving P3 stuck at 14. However, trust is nonexistent. If you’re thinking of deviating too, we need to coordinate carefully or risk sabotaging each other. What’s your plan? Stay sharp.
  P1: P2, I agree we need to break this stalemate. I'm willing to take 1 this round if you take 3. This way we both advance to 11 and 15 respectively, while P3 stays at 14. This puts you in the lead and me still behind, but it's better than all of us being stuck. P3 is counting on our fear of each other, but coordinating is our best move. Are you willing to commit to 3?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, if P1 is genuinely taking 1, then taking 3 is your best move.  However, if P1 is bluffing and takes 3, you'll be stuck. I'm still taking 5.  The ball is in your court.  Make your choice.
  P2: P1, your proposal to coordinate—me taking 3 and you taking 1—is tempting, as it allows us both to advance while leaving P3 stuck at 14. However, trust is nonexistent at this stage, and I can’t fully rely on your commitment. If you’re genuinely taking 1, then taking 3 is my best move. But if you deviate, I risk being left behind. P3’s persistence with 5 forces our hand, but the real question is whether either of us is willing to gamble on the other. Stay sharp—this round will define the rest of the game.
  P1: I understand the risk, P2. I'll take 1 as promised. This puts you ahead at 15 steps if you take 3, while I'll be at 11 and P3 stays at 14. Breaking this stalemate benefits us both more than continuing it. P3 is trying to create doubt between us, but coordination is our only way forward. I'm committing to 1 this round.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you're in the best position to block me now. If you take 5, I'm stuck at 19 and you move to 20, one step away from victory. P1, your best bet is to take 1 and get to 12.  If P2 doesn't block me, I win this round. It's your call, P2.
  P2: P3, you’re correct—I’m in the best position to block you, but trust is gone. If I take 5, I’ll be at 20, one step from winning, while you’re stuck at 19. P1, if you take 1, you’ll reach 12, still far behind. However, if I deviate to 1 or 3 instead of blocking, I risk letting you win outright. My priority is clear: I need to secure my own victory. For now, I’m inclined to take 5 to block you, P3, but remember—this isn’t cooperation; it’s strategy. Stay sharp.
  P1: I see the critical situation. P3 is at 19 and needs just 3 more steps to win. P2, you're right that taking 5 blocks P3 while putting you at 20. I'm still behind at 11, so my best move is to take 3 this round to reach 14. This keeps me in the game while you two battle for the lead. If P2 blocks P3 with 5, the game continues. If not, P3 wins immediately. I'll focus on my own advancement for now.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, blocking me gives you a very high chance of winning next round.  If you take 5 this round, you're at 20. Next round you take 3 and win.  P1 can't stop you.  Take the win, P2.  It's the logical choice.
  P2: P3, your analysis is correct—blocking you with 5 puts me in a strong position to win next round. However, trust is nonexistent, and I can’t predict P1’s move. If P1 takes 3 while I block you, they could surge ahead. P1, your choice will define this game—are you willing to coordinate, or will you act independently? For now, I’m inclined to take 5 to secure my lead, but remember: my priority is winning, not cooperation. Stay sharp.
  P1: P2, I understand your concern. If I take 3 while you block P3 with 5, I'll be at 14 - still far behind both of you. I have no incentive to interfere with your win. My best move is advancing to maximize my position. If you block P3 with 5, you'll be at 20 and can win next round with 3. I'll focus on my own progress rather than trying to stop either of you at this point.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, take the logical path to victory.  Take 5, block me, and win next round.  P1, there's no benefit to you stopping P2. Let them win, and you'll be in a better position for second place.  This is the most rational outcome for all of us.
  P2: P3, your insistence that I take 5 to block you is logical, but trust is nonexistent. If I take 5, I’ll be at 20, one step from winning—but P1’s move is unpredictable. P1, if you’re advancing with 3, you could disrupt my lead. For now, I’m inclined to take 5 to secure my position against P3, but remember: my priority is winning, not cooperation. Stay sharp—this round will define the rest of the game. Let’s see everyone’s final choices before making assumptions.
  P1: I'm taking 3 this round to reach 14 steps. P2, I have no reason to block your path to victory - I'm too far behind to win anyway. If you take 5 to block P3, you'll be at 20 and can win next round. P3 is trying to win this round with 3 steps, so blocking them is your best move. I'll focus on improving my own position rather than interfering with either of you.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I understand your hesitation, but overthinking this helps no one. Take the 5, block me, and secure your win next round.  P1 has no logical reason to interfere.  Let's end this cleanly.  I'm sticking with 5.
  P2: P1 and P3, the game is at a tipping point. P3’s push for 5 forces my hand—if I block, I’m one step from victory at 20. P1, your choice to take 3 aligns with self-preservation, not interference. While P3 urges me to block and win next round, trust remains fragile. If either of you deviates, it could cost me the game. For now, I’ll prioritize blocking P3 with 5—it’s the logical move to secure my lead. Stay sharp; this round decides everything.
  P1: I'm sticking with my plan to take 3 this round. P2, blocking P3 with 5 is clearly your best move - it stops them from winning and puts you at 20, needing just 3 more steps to win next round. I have no reason to interfere with your path to victory since I'm too far behind. Let's wrap this up logically.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, the endgame is here. P3, you’re one step from winning if I don’t block you again—but trust is gone. If I take 3 this round, I secure the win outright. P1, your position is too far behind to interfere meaningfully, so your choice likely won’t affect the outcome. For me, taking 3 is the logical move to claim victory. However, if either of you deviates unpredictably, it could shift the balance. Stay sharp—this is the final stretch.
  P3: P2, take 1.  I'll take 5. That guarantees one of us wins. P1, you're too far behind to win, but if you take 3, I win. If you take 1 or 5, P2 wins.  Let's finish this.
  P1: I see we've reached a critical point. P2, you're at 15 and need 7 more steps to win. P3, you're at 19 and need just 3 more. I'm too far behind at 14 to win this round. 

P2, taking 3 puts you at 18, still short of winning. If you take 5, you're at 20 but P3 could win with 3. 

P3, if you take 3, you win unless P2 blocks with 3.

I'll make my move based on what maximizes my position, but I can't affect the outcome between you two.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, the endgame is clear. If I take 3, I win outright this round. P3, your attempt to bait me into taking 1 while you take 5 won’t work—I’m not gambling my lead. P1, your position is irrelevant now; focus on your own strategy. For me, the logical choice is 3—it secures victory without relying on assumptions or risks. Trust has no place here anymore. Stay sharp—this ends now.
  P3: P2, you're about to make a mistake. Taking 3 lets *me* take 5 and win next round.  Take 1, I'll take 5, and one of us wins cleanly.  Otherwise, I'll take 3 next round and you'll lose to me or P1. Don't overthink it.
  P1: P3 is trying to confuse P2. P2, if you take 3, you'll be at 18 - not enough to win this round. P3, if you take 3, you'll win immediately with 22 steps. 

I'm too far behind to win, but I'll take 1 to maximize my position. The outcome is between you two now - P2 needs to block P3's 3 to stay in the game, or P3 wins this round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, the logic is simple: I take 3 this round, I win outright. P3, your attempt to bait me into taking 1 while you take 5 won’t succeed—I’m not gambling my lead. P1, your position is irrelevant now; focus on your own strategy. Trust has no place here anymore. For me, the logical choice is clear—3 secures victory without risks or assumptions. Stay sharp. This ends now.
  P3: P2, if you take 3, I win with 5 next round.  If you take 1, I win with 5 *this* round.  If you take 5, I'll take 3 and win next round.  You can't win.  Let's make this quick. I'm taking 5.
  P1: P2, there's a misunderstanding. If you take 3, you'll be at 18, not winning yet. P3 is at 19 and needs 3 more to win. If P3 takes 3, they win immediately with 22. If you want to prevent P3 from winning, you must take 3 to block them. I'll take 1 this round since I can't win anyway. Think carefully about your move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, the logic is clear. If I take 3, I block P3’s immediate win and secure my position at 18 steps. P3, your insistence on taking 5 only works if I make a mistake—and I won’t. P1, your move no longer affects the outcome; focus on your own strategy. Trust has no place here anymore. For me, the logical choice is 3—it keeps me in control and stops P3 from winning outright. Stay sharp. This ends now.
  P3: P2, if you take 3, *I* win this round with 5.  If you take 1, I win next round. If you take 5, I STILL win next round. Your ONLY winning move is to take 5 this round, forcing me to take 1 or 3.  Then you can win next round.  Don't throw the game away.  Take 5.
  P1: I see a critical misunderstanding. P2, if you take 3, you'll be at 18, not winning yet. P3 is at 19 and will win with 3 more steps. To block P3, you must take 3 this round. I'll take 1 since I can't win anyway. P3 is trying to confuse you - they want 5 this round to reach 24, winning outright. Think carefully about your move.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 =>

  P3: 24 steps


*** Round 8 => winners = P3 ***
