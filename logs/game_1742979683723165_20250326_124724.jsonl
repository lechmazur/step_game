Why suddenly propose a plan where P3 wins instead? This reversal seems designed to cause confusion or collision, which helps no one but maybe you in the long run.\n\nP3, let's stick to the plan we confirmed moments ago: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. This avoids collision, lets me win, and you advance safely to 23. I am playing 5 based on this agreement. Let's finish the game without another wasted round."}
