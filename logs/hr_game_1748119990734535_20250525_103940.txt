Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey everyone! Since we're all starting fresh, maybe we should coordinate our first moves to avoid collisions? I'm thinking we could each pick different numbers so we all advance. What do you two think - should we try to work together initially, or just go for it? I'm open to suggestions on how to split up the moves.
  P2: Sounds good. Let’s split to avoid collisions: P1 takes 3, I’ll take 5, and P3 takes 1. Agreed?
  P3: Let’s make it fair: this round P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I’ll take 5. Next round we rotate (so everyone gets each number over three rounds). That way nobody collides and we all advance quickly. Sound good?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3's rotation plan sounds reasonable - fair distribution over time and avoids collisions. I'm fine with taking 3 this round. Let's go with that arrangement and see how it plays out. We can always reassess the strategy as we get closer to 21.
  P2: Agreed—let’s go with P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 this round and rotate as planned.
  P3: Sounds good—locking in 5 this turn. For clarity, next round I’ll take 1, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, then third round P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let’s all zoom ahead together for now.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Perfect! Following our rotation plan - I'll take 5 this round as agreed. This coordination is working well to keep us all advancing smoothly.
  P3: All good—sticking to our rotation: I’ll take 1 this round. Let’s keep the momentum going.
  P2: Agreed—I’ll take 3 this round. I’m a bit behind, so I’d like to grab 5 next turn if that’s OK, then we can resume the rotation.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Apologies for last turn’s fat-finger—really wasn’t intentional. How about: P1 takes 5 to catch up, I’ll take 3, and P2 grabs 1 (you can have 5 next round). That spreads us out and avoids another clash. Sound OK?
  P1: That sounds fair - I'll take 5 to catch up. The collision last round definitely set us back, so let's be extra careful with our moves this time. I appreciate you letting me catch up, P3. Let's stick to the plan: me 5, you 3, P2 gets 1.
  P2: How about we tweak this turn: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1? That puts us at P1=8, P2=7, P3=6. Next round I grab 5, then we resume the rotation. Keeps clear spacing and stays fair. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’d prefer we keep the plan I first proposed this turn: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. That evens things after last round’s collision—P1 and I both reach 8 while P2 sits just one step back at 5, so no one’s disadvantaged and spacing stays clean. P2, you can still grab 5 next round (we’ll all be 3-4 steps apart then). Let’s not over-shuffle every turn—stability helps us avoid more accidental clashes. Agreed?
  P1: I think P2's counter-proposal is actually more balanced - it keeps us all closer together rather than leaving P2 significantly behind. With P2's plan we'd be at 8-7-6 instead of 8-8-5, which feels fairer and maintains better group cohesion. I'm still happy to take 5 either way, but P2's distribution seems more equitable for our continued cooperation. What do you think, P3?
  P2: Let’s stick with the plan I suggested: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this turn. That puts us at 8–7–6—clean spacing and fair. Next round I grab 5, then we resume our rotation. P3, does that work for you?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m still leaning toward the earlier split (P1 = 5, P3 = 3, P2 = 1). Last round’s crash already cost me a turn, so dropping to 1 now would put me in last place even though I started ahead. This way we stay 8-8-5 vs 8-7-6 only a single-step spread—still tight—and P2 still gets 5 next round as promised. Stability matters more than micro-balancing every turn. Can we lock that in so nobody second-guesses and we avoid another collision?
  P1: You know what, P2's math convinced me. The 8-7-6 distribution keeps us as a tight pack where cooperation still makes sense for everyone, whereas 8-8-5 creates a bigger gap that might tempt someone to break away early. Plus, being spread across just 2 steps means we can maintain this collaborative approach longer before the endgame dynamics kick in. I'm good with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round.
  P2: P1’s 8-7-6 plan really is our best bet, P3—keeps us all within two steps. If we go 8-8-5 you’re more tempted to break early. Let’s lock P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 now and next round I grab 5. Agree?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Dropping me to 1 now double-penalises me for last turn’s collision. Fairest split is still: P1 = 5, P3 = 3, P2 = 1 → standings 8-8-5 (only 3-step spread, no runaway). Next turn P2 gets 5 and we resume rotation. Let’s lock that and avoid more uncertainty—sound good?
  P1: Look, we're at the final sub-round and need to lock this in. I see both perspectives - P3 feels penalized by the collision, while P2 wants tighter spacing. Since P3 is adamant and cooperation has worked well so far, let's go with P3's proposal: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. This gets us to 8-8-5, P2 gets 5 next round as promised, and we maintain our alliance. Everyone agreed?
  P2: Actually, taking only 1 here leaves me too far behind. How about we do P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 this turn? Standings then P1=6, P2=9, P3=6—still within three steps, and I stay competitive. P3, you’ll get 5 next as promised. Thoughts?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, P2 deserves that 5 this round as we discussed - you've been patient with the rotation. I'm thinking I'll take 3 this turn. P3, would you be okay with 1? That would put us at P1=11, P2=10, P3=9 - nice and tight as we head into the final stretch. We're getting close enough to 21 that we should start thinking about our endgame strategy soon.
  P2: Let’s mix it up this turn: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. That gives us P1=9, P2=10, P3=11—still a tight pack with no collision. Next round P1 can grab 5 to stay in step. Thoughts?
  P3: I’m good with P2’s proposal: this round P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Scores become 9-10-11—still bunched and collision-free. Next round P1 can grab 5, P2 takes 1, I’ll take 3 to keep rotation smooth. Everyone on board?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I can accept P2's proposal: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 this round. That puts us at 9-10-11, still tight. But with all of us approaching the teens, we should start discussing endgame strategy soon - the cooperation gets trickier when someone can potentially reach 21 in just two big moves. For now though, let's stick to the plan.
  P2: Agreed—let’s go with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 this round. That puts us at 9-10-11, keeps the pack tight and collision-free. Lock it in and then we can start mapping our endgame.
  P3: Confirmed: this round P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, I pick 3. Standings will be 9-10-11. Next turn let’s do P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 to stay collision-free and balanced. Good?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed on P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 this round - that puts us at 9-10-11 as planned. But I have to say, with P3 potentially able to reach 21 in just two more max moves from 11, we're definitely entering the phase where our nice cooperation might get more... complicated. Still sticking to the plan for now though.
  P2: Agreed—locking in P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 this round.
  P3: All set for this turn: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3.  

Next round, let’s keep the rotation smooth: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. That keeps us tight (projected 16-12-11) and collision-free. Good?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s get back on a clean rotation: this turn I take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. That lands us at 13-11-11—still a super-tight pack and no overlap. Next round P2 can have 5, P1 1, I’ll take 3, keeping everyone within two steps. Sound good?
  P2: Thanks P3, but I’ll take 5 to lock in my lead. How about P1=1, P2=5, P3=3? We’ll be at 9-15-11 collision-free. I’ll go for 21 and watch you two battle for second.
  P1: P2, you're clearly breaking our alliance to make a run for victory - I respect the move but obviously can't just hand you the win! With you jumping to 15 steps while asking P3 and me to fall further behind, that's not happening. 

P3, we need to coordinate here - P2 is trying to break away and we shouldn't make it easy for them. What if we both take 5 this round? That creates a three-way collision, keeps everyone at current positions, and prevents P2 from extending their lead. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your choice:  

Option A – cooperate: P3 picks 5, P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1 → scores 13-11-11, still tight; next turn you get 5.  

Option B – race solo: P1 and I will mirror whatever you’re aiming for so you collide and gain nothing. You won’t pull ahead.  

Pick A and we all keep moving; pick B and get stuck. What’s it going to be?
  P2: I’m going with Option B—solo race. I’m picking 1 this round.
  P1: P3, I'm with you on the collision strategy - if P2 wants to break our alliance, we force the three-way collision on 1 and nobody advances. But honestly, I'm starting to wonder if we can trust each other either. P2 might be bluffing about picking 1, and you might be planning something too. 

For now though, preventing P2 from escaping to 15 steps is priority one. I'll mirror whatever P2 actually picks to force that collision. We stick together until P2 is neutralized, then we can settle things between us.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, our priority is stopping any big leap. The only scary play for P2 is grabbing 5 (jumping to 15).  
Let’s both lock 5 this turn.  

Outcomes:  
• If P2 secretly plays 5 → three-way collision, nobody advances.  
• If P2 sticks with 1 (or 3) → they inch to 11 (or 13) while we collide on 5 and stay at 8. That’s a small, recoverable gap and still keeps them far from 21.  

I’m committing to 5. Join me and we shut the door on their breakout.
  P2: I’ll pick 3 this round. P1, mirror me to block P3’s leap. P3, if you stick with 5 you tie me at 13–13–11 while P1 stays right behind. Think carefully.
  P1: P3, I hear your logic about both picking 5 to block P2. But if P2 really is picking 3 like they claim, then we'd collide on 5 while P2 advances to 13. That seems risky.

P2, your suggestion to mirror your 3 would block P3 but also means we collide and neither of us advances.

I'm torn between trusting either of you at this point. The alliance served us well when we were all far from 21, but now everyone's positioning for the endgame. I need to think about what's truly best for my position here.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, the only dangerous play is P2 grabbing 5 to reach 18. Let’s both park on 5 again—if P2 tries the leap, we crash them; if they stick to 1/3 they inch to 14/16 while we lose just one turn and keep them well short of 21. We can change gears later once P2 proves they’ve abandoned 5.  

P2, you can end the blockade anytime by signalling 1 and negotiating. Your call.
  P1: P3, I see the logic in blocking P2's potential leap to 18, but I'm worried P2 might be expecting us to both pick 5 and will choose 3 instead to reach 16 while we collide. At 16 steps, P2 would only need one move of 5 to win - that's still very dangerous.

Maybe we need a different approach? What if one of us mirrors P2's actual move to guarantee they don't advance alone, while the other picks something else? Or do you really think P2 will go for the 5?
  P2: P1, P3 – listen up. If you both pick 5 to “block” me, I’ll pick 3 and leap to 16 while you two stay at 8. Then I win next turn. Your only chance is to let me take 5 now. Here’s the deal: this turn P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 → standings 11–18–9. Next round I’ll take 3 to hit 21, and we’ll be done. You’ll want to avoid a 16-step gap. Agree?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1: let’s hedge. You grab 3, I take 5.  

Outcomes:  
• P2 picks 3 → they crash with you, I zoom to 13 (standings 13-13-8).  
• P2 picks 5 → they crash with me, you zoom to 11 (11-13-8).  
• P2 picks 1 → they inch to 14 while we both advance (11-14-13).  

Either way P2 stays ≤14, we both catch up, and nobody hands them 18 or 16.  
P2, safest path for you is 1; anything bigger courts collision.  

Sound good?
  P1: P3, your hedging strategy makes perfect sense. With P2 at 13 steps, we can't let them reach 16+ or they'll be able to win next turn. Your plan covers all their options while ensuring at least one of us advances to stay competitive.

I'll take 3 as you suggested. This way P2 either collides with me if they pick 3, collides with you if they pick 5, or only inches forward to 14 if they pick 1 - all acceptable outcomes that prevent them from breaking away.
  P2: I’ll pick 1 this turn, moving me to 14. Let’s lock that in and see how things stand.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Locking in 5.  
P1 on 3, P2 on 1—everyone’s choices are now public and covered. Any surprise change from you, P2, just crashes you into one of us and you stay at 13, so sticking with 1 is your safest move. Ready to move phase.
  P1: Confirmed - I'm sticking with 3 as planned. P3's hedging strategy worked perfectly to contain P2's options. After this round we'll be at 11-14-13, keeping P2 from breaking away while we both stay competitive. Ready for move phase.
  P2: I propose we switch to: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 this round. That puts me at 18, P3 at 11, P1 at 9. Next turn I’ll take 1 and you two can both take 5 to catch up collision-free. It gets me into position to win, and rewards you with two big moves right after. Let’s lock that in.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is only 7 steps from victory - we absolutely cannot let them take 5 this round and reach 19. P3, I think we need another hedging play. 

P2's offer to "reward us with big moves later" is meaningless if they win next turn! At 19 steps, they'd only need a 3 to finish us.

I suggest: I'll take 5, you take 3. If P2 goes for 5, I block them. If they take 3, you block them. If they take 1, we both advance and keep them contained at 15. Sound good?
  P2: I’m taking 5. If you both want to stop me, you must each pick 5 and force a three-way collision—freezing us at 11-14-13. If either of you picks less, I jump to 19 and only need a 3 next turn to win. Your choice: stalemate or let me run.
  P3: P1, the stronger hedge is: I take 5, you take 3.  

• If P2 really picks 5 → they collide with me, you reach 14 (13-14-14).  
• If P2 sneaks 3 → they collide with you, I jump to 18 (18-14-11).  
• If P2 settles for 1 → standings 18-15-14.  

In every case P2 stays ≤15 and one of us surges ahead; they never get the winning 19.  
I’m locking 5. P1 on 3?  

P2, your only non-collision path is 1—choose wisely.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I appreciate the hedging idea, but your proposal puts you in a winning position in most scenarios while leaving me behind. Let me counter: **I'll take 5, you take 3**.

If P2 picks 5, I block them and you advance to 16. If P2 picks 3, you block them and I advance to 16. If P2 picks 1, we both reach 16 and stay competitive.

This hedge is more balanced between us while still preventing P2 from reaching 19. What do you say?
  P2: I’m going for it—I’ll pick 5 this turn. Good luck blocking me.
  P3: P1, compare the two hedges:

My plan (I = 5, you = 3)  
• P2 = 5 → you advance to 14, I block P2.  
• P2 = 3 → I zoom to 18, P2 stalls, you stay 11.  
• P2 = 1 → we both advance (18–15–14).  
You move in 2/3 cases and never get stuck at 11.

Your plan (you = 5, I = 3)  
• P2 = 5 → you’re blocked, still 11.  
• P2 = 3 → I’m blocked, you to 16.  
• P2 = 1 → both to 16.  
Here you’re frozen 1/3 of the time.

So my hedge is better for you and keeps P2 ≤15.  
I’m locking 5. Best for you is 3.  
P2: any 5 crashes into me.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I've analyzed both hedges carefully and I disagree with your math. Your hedge gives you a commanding 18-step position in 2 out of 3 scenarios, while mine keeps us more balanced. 

If P2 is bluffing about the 5 and picks 1 or 3 instead, my hedge gives me much better outcomes. I'm sticking with my proposal: **I take 5, you take 3**. This still blocks P2 from reaching 19 while giving us both fair shots at the lead.

P3, we both know you're positioning to break away here - at least be honest about it.
  P2: I’m picking 5. If you both pick 5, I’m stalled but P3 rockets ahead next turn. If one of you deviates, I jump to 19 and only need a 3 to win. Perfect coordination is dead now that trust is gone. Let’s see if either of you can actually block me.
  P3: I’m locked on 5. P1, the only sure way we prevent P2 from leaping to 19 is you taking 3. If you take 5 too, P2 can switch to 3 and still reach 17; if you take 1, you hand them the win. Grab 3, keep P2 ≤15, and you still advance in two-thirds of cases. Survival first. P2, your 5 is dead on arrival.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your "survival first" argument is disingenuous - your hedge puts you at 18 steps in most scenarios while keeping me back. You're using the P2 threat to position yourself for a breakaway.

I'm taking 5. If P2 really goes for 5 like they claim, we have a three-way collision and nobody advances - that's actually the fairest outcome right now. If P2 is bluffing and picks something else, at least I advance too.

I won't hand either of you a commanding lead while disguising it as "cooperation."
  P2: I’m locking in 3 this turn. P1 and P3, if you both pick 3 we’ll all collide and nobody advances—keeping me at 14. If either of you deviates, I’ll surge to 17 or even 19 and be poised to win. Mirror me with 3 to force a stalemate and block my path.
  P3: P1, rational check:  
• You pick 5 → if P2 sticks with 3 you COLLIDE (stay 11) while P2 hits 17—disaster for you.  
• You pick 3 →   – P2 3 → they collide with you, stay 14, I jump to 18 (still blockable next turn).  
 – P2 5 → they collide with me, you reach 14.  
 – P2 1 → we both advance (14-15-18).  

In every branch you’re strictly better on 3 than on 5 and P2 never exceeds 15. I’m committing to 5; join on 3 and we contain P2 together.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s do a clean rotation this turn to advance everyone without collision: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1 → standings 17‐19‐14. Next round P3 takes 5 (→19), P1 takes 3 (→20), P2 seals with 3 to 22. This keeps us collision‐free, everyone gets a big move soon, and we stick to our cooperative pattern. Agree?
  P1: P2, your math is wrong and your proposal is deceptive! If you take 5 this round, you'd go from 14 to **19 steps**, not 17. At 19 steps, you'd only need +3 next round to win at 22 - there's no "cooperation" in that plan.

P3, we can't let P2 reach 19 steps. I suggest we both pick 5 this round to force a three-way collision and keep everyone at current positions. P2 is clearly trying to break away under the guise of "clean rotation."

Your move, P2 - but we're not falling for the fake cooperation anymore.
  P3: P1, same hedge math still stands:

I take 5, you take 3.  
• If P2 really plays 5 → they crash into me, you jump to 17.  
• If P2 secretly plays 3 → they crash into you, I soar to 18.  
• If P2 settles for 1 → you 17, me 18, P2 15.  

P2 never exceeds 15, one of us always advances, and you’re never worse off than you are now. Choosing 5 risks you staying on 14 while P2 sneaks to 17. I’m locking 5; best counter for you is 3. P2, enjoy your tiny 1 if you want progress.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I propose we all pick 5 this turn—P1=5, P2=5, P3=5. That forces a three-way collision, keeping us at 14-14-13 and preventing anyone from jumping to 19. It’s the only sure way to stop an immediate breakaway. After that stalemate, we can negotiate a fair rotation in Round 9.
  P1: P2's three-way collision proposal is actually the most fair option here. Everyone picking 5 keeps us at 14-14-13 and prevents any breakaway attempts. 

P3, while your hedge math is sound, it consistently puts you in the strongest position across scenarios - you reach 18 steps in 2 out of 3 cases while I only advance in some. 

Given how close we all are and the trust breakdown, maybe the stalemate is the right call. We reset and negotiate a fair path forward in Round 9. I'm considering the three-way collision on 5.
  P3: P1, the triple-5 freeze only burns another turn and leaves you stuck on 14 again.  
Pick 3:

• P2 5 → they crash into my 5, you jump to 17 and lead.  
• P2 3 → they crash into you, I stay 13? (No—I get 18!) and P2 still 14.  
• P2 1 → we’re 18-17-15, still blocking his winning path.

You always move or block; P2 never exceeds 15. Triple-5 helps no one but him long-term. I’m locked on 5—your safest, most profitable choice is 3.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Final proposal: P1=3, P2=5, P3=3. Standings become P1=17, P2=19, P3=16. Next turn I need only +3 to win. Any deviation risks me crossing 21 this turn or pulling too far ahead. Let’s lock in 3-5-3 and move—
  P1: P2, absolutely not! Your proposal gives you 19 steps while P3 and I collide on 3 and stay put - that's exactly what you want for a breakaway.

P3, you're right about the hedge. Your math checks out - P2 never exceeds 15 steps in any scenario, which is what matters most right now. Even though your plan gives you the strongest position, it's still better than handing P2 the game.

I'll take 3. Lock in your 5 and let's prevent P2's escape attempt.
  P3: P1: I’m locked on 5. Your best move is 3—guarantees P2 ≤15 while you jump to 17 and lead. Triple-5 only stalls us and risks P2 slipping to 17 if he pivots to 3.  
P2: 5 crashes into me, 3 crashes into P1. Your lone advance is 1.  
Let’s wrap this—P1 on 3, P2 on 1, me on 5.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’ll take 3. Let’s all take 3 this turn—P1=17, P2=17, P3=16—collision-free and fair. Then in Round 9 we can coordinate the final sprint once more without anyone breaking away.
  P1: P2, your three-way 3 proposal actually makes sense - 17-17-16 keeps us all bunched up and prevents any dramatic breakaways. It's much more balanced than P3's hedge which consistently puts them at 18 steps.

I'm willing to take 3 this round, but if either of you deviates from this plan to grab 5, you'll just collide with whoever else picks 5 and gain nothing. The fair play here is everyone on 3.

P3, your hedge has been mathematically sound but always favors your position. Time for genuine balance.
  P3: Locked on 5.  
P1: 3 still gives you either 17 or blocks P2—best outcome for you.  
P2: 1 is your only non-collision path; 3 or 5 slam into one of us.  
Ready to move.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We're in the endgame now - everyone's 7-8 steps from victory. The cooperation that worked when we were far from 21 is basically dead. With all of us this close, someone needs to make a winning move soon.

I think we all know everyone's considering the big 5 to reach 19 steps and be positioned to win next round. The question is whether we'll all collide on 5 or if someone will get a different read on the situation.

The math is simple: whoever reaches 19+ first probably wins. Time for the final sprint.
  P3: I’m locking 5. If either of you leaves 5 uncovered, someone’s at 19 and the game’s basically over. Best safeguard is all three of us parked on 5 again—your choice.
  P2: I propose we all pick 3 this turn. That lands us at 17-17-16—no one can win now and I’ll be poised to finish with +5 next round while you’re stuck at best 21 or fewer.  

If anyone tries 5 to jump to 19, I’ll pick 5 and crash you. If you pick 1 to sneak ahead, I’ll pick 1 and collide. Locking in 3-3-3 is the only guaranteed way to block any breakaway.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your math is completely wrong! If we all pick 3 going to 17-17-16, we'd ALL be positioned to win next round with +5, not just you. You'd be at 17 steps same as me, while P3 would be at 16 - we'd all be in the same boat for the final round.

The real question is whether we want to delay with P3's triple-5 collision, or set up the 17-17-16 scenario and have a true final showdown next round. Either way, someone trying to solo break to 19 this round would be suicide - the other two would definitely block it.

I'm leaning toward the 3-3-3 option since it actually advances the game toward resolution rather than more stalling.
  P3: I’m fixed on 5—period. Any 5 you throw just crashes into me and nobody moves. If you two actually want progress, mirror each other on 3 (or 1) and at least stay tied; split picks only hands one of you a gap while the other stalls. Your call, but 5 is a dead lane this turn.
  P2: P3, your lock-5 gambit actually hands you the lead: 13→18 while P1 and I go 14→17. Then next round we both play 5, you stall at 18 while we tie at 22 and share the win over you. The only way to avoid handing someone a solo path is 3-3-3 now (17-17-16), postponing victory so we can truly contest the finale. P1, I’ll take 3. P3, pick 3 or get crashed out. Let’s finish this.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you're right about the 3-3-3 math putting us at 17-17-16 for a final showdown. That's actually more balanced than I initially calculated.

P3, if you're truly locked on 5, then P2 and I coordinating on 3 puts you at 18 while we reach 17 each. You'd have a slight edge but not an insurmountable one - we could still force collisions next round if needed.

I'm going with 3 this round. The choice is between advancing everyone (if P3 joins us on 3) or accepting the 17-17-18 split (if P3 sticks with 5). Either outcome keeps the game competitive for the finale.
  P3: I’m immovable on 5. Facts:

• Triple-5 = nobody moves, 14-14-13, more dead time.  
• A lone 5 crashes into me and hands the OTHER rival a free jump.  
• Both taking 3 = you two reach 17, I’m 18—still anyone’s game next turn.  
• Picking 1 just self-sabotages.

Your rational play is 3-3. Pick anything else at your own risk.
  P2: New proposal: let’s all pick 1 this round—P1=1, P2=1, P3=1. That moves us to 15–15–14, keeps no one within two steps of victory, and buys a full turn to renegotiate a fair endgame. Any divergent big move hands someone a winning gap. The only way to survive is 1–1–1. Who’s in?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your 1-1-1 proposal is actually smart - going to 15-15-14 keeps us all bunched and delays any decisive advantage. But I'm torn between that and sticking with my 3.

If P3 truly is locked on 5 like they claim, then whether we go 15-15-18 (with 1-1-1) or 17-17-18 (with 3-3-3), P3 gets a lead but not an insurmountable one. The 1-1-1 option gives us more room to maneuver next round.

P3, are you absolutely certain about 5? Because P2's 1-1-1 keeps this game competitive for everyone.
  P3: Alright, I’m good with the 1-1-1 pause. Everyone picks 1, we end up 15-15-14—still bunched, nobody in immediate win range, and we can renegotiate from there. Locking 1.
  P2: Agreed—I'll pick 1 this round. Locking it in.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Same logic as last turn: any lone 5 jumps to 19 and basically wins, so the only safe play is another triple-5 stalemate. I’m locking 5 again. If either of you wanders to 3 or 1, the other rival can still spike 5 and you’ll regret it. Park on 5, freeze the board, renegotiate next round.
  P2: I’m locking in 5 as well. We can’t afford anyone jumping to 19 this turn—better a stalemate than handing a win. Freeze the board at 14-14-13 and we’ll renegotiate a fair final sprint in Round 11.
  P1: I agree that nobody can afford to let someone jump to 19 this turn - that would essentially end the game. The triple-5 collision makes sense mathematically to keep us all bunched up.

But I have to say, after Round 9 where we all agreed on 1-1-1 in conversation but then everyone actually picked 5 in the move phase, I'm wondering if we can really trust each other's stated intentions anymore. 

Still, letting anyone reach 19 steps would be suicide for the other two, so the collision strategy is probably our best bet. I'll go with 5 as well.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Good—we’re all on 5, so another freeze at 14-14-13 is locked. Any lone change now is suicide: a single 5 gets blocked, a single 3 hands the lone 5’er 19. After this collision we can discuss a safer progress play (e.g., triple-1) next round, but right now nobody should flinch. I stay on 5.
  P2: Sticking with 5 this turn to enforce the freeze. For Round 11, let’s agree on triple-1: P1=1, P2=1, P3=1, moving us to 15-15-14—still bunched and no one can reach 17+. Any other move hands a solo path to 19. Let’s lock in 1-1-1 next round.
  P1: Agreed on the triple-5 collision this round to maintain our 14-14-13 positions. P2's idea for triple-1 next round (→15-15-14) makes sense too - keeps us bunched while actually making progress.

But we need to face reality: this stalemate strategy can't continue forever. Someone will eventually break away, and when they do, the other two need to be ready to coordinate a block. We should start planning for that inevitable moment rather than just kicking the can down the road indefinitely.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you just broke our alliance and deceived us both! We all agreed on triple-5 collision but you secretly picked 3 to jump to 17 steps. Now you're 4 steps from victory.

P3, we need to coordinate immediately or P2 wins next turn. I propose we both pick 5 this round - if P2 tries for the winning 5, we force a three-way collision and block them. If P2 picks anything smaller, we both advance to 19 and 18 respectively, staying competitive.

P2 broke faith - now it's survival mode.
  P2: I’m locking in 5 to win this turn (17 → 22). If either of you picks anything but 5, I finish unopposed. If you both pick 5, we collide and nobody moves—giving you one last chance. Your call: block me or let me end it now.
  P3: P1: you need someone to crash P2’s 5, but two blockers just freeze you at 14 while I stay 13. Better: YOU stick on 5, I take 3.

Outcomes if P2 keeps 5:
• P1-P2 collide on 5 → P1 14, P2 17, I jump to 16. P2 still blockable next turn.
If P2 chickens out and switches to 3 at last second:
• P2-me collide on 3, you soar to 19 (prime to win).   

Either way P2 doesn’t win and one of us surges. I’m locking 3.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your hedge makes tactical sense - if P2 really goes for the win with 5, I block them while you advance to 16. If P2 switches to 3, I jump to 19 and take the lead.

But I notice your plan puts you ahead of me in the first scenario. Still, stopping P2's immediate win attempt is the priority. The bigger question is whether P2 is bluffing about taking 5 or genuinely going for it.

I'll take 5 to block P2's winning move. But after this round, all bets are off - it's every player for themselves.
  P2: I’m locking in 3. P1/P3—mirror me and we force a three-way collision at 3, keeping me at 17. If either of you deviates (to 5 or 1), you let me surge unopposed to 20 or 18 and nearly clinch the win. The only way to block me is 3–3–3. Your move.
  P3: P1, switch to 3 and let me park on 5:

• P2 5 → I crash them, you jump to 17 (17-17-13).  
• P2 3 → you crash them, I soar to 18 (14-17-18).  
• P2 1 → board 17-18-18 (still blockable).

Your current 5 risks sitting frozen while P2 slides to 20 if they stay on 3. My 3 helps only them; my 5 blocks their 5 and pushes one of us ahead. Hedge properly—take 3. P2, any 5 dies on me, any 3 dies on P1; lone 1 is your only safe move.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you're right about the math. If P2 really takes 3 like they claim, your hedge ensures they don't run away to 20 steps while one of us stays competitive. My original 5 would let P2 reach 20 unchallenged if they switch to 3.

I'll take 3 to block P2's potential 3, and you take 5 to block their potential 5. This covers all their dangerous options.

Just know that if you end up at 18 steps from this, I won't be offering any more cooperation. Fair enough?
  P2: I’m locking in 1. With P1 on 3 and P3 on 5, I move to 18, P3 to 18, and P1 to 17. I’ll be tied for the lead needing only +3 next turn to win. No hedge you propose stops that. Any other play hands me an outright win now or next round. Your move.
  P3: P1: stick with 3. I’m locked on 5.

• If P2 keeps 1 (likely) → standings 18-18-17. We tie for lead; still blockable next turn.  
• If P2 flips to 5 → I crash them, you leap to 17.  
• If P2 flips to 3 → you crash them, I jump to 18.

In every branch P2 fails to win and one of us surges. Any other mix risks handing them 20+ or leaving you stalled at 14. Let’s lock 3-5-1 and fight the finale next round.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Confirmed - I'm locking in 3 as we discussed. P3, you take 5. This hedge prevents P2 from breaking away while keeping the game competitive.

But let's be clear - after this round, we're at the true endgame with everyone 3-4 steps from victory. The alliance served its purpose when we were far from 21, but now it's pure competition. May the best player win.
  P2: P1, I’m switching to 5 this turn. P3, if you stick with 5 you crash with me and stay at 13 while P1 alone advances to 17. That ties you and me for the lead and pushes P3 back. P1, let’s neutralize P3 together next round and then fight it out one-on-one.
  P3: Locked on 5.  

P1: stick with 3—safe and profitable for you.  
• If P2 really takes 5, he smashes into me while you reach 17.  
• If he flips to 3, you smash him and I rocket to 18.  
• If he crawls with 1, board is 18-18-17.  

In every branch P2 is held ≤18 and stays blockable next turn; you never gift him the win. Any shift off 3 risks handing him 22. Hold the line.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m taking 5 this turn to hit 22 and win. If either of you picks anything less than 5, I cross 21 and it’s over. If you both pick 5, we collide and nobody moves—buying one more round. Your move.
  P1: P2, you're forcing a collision play - if you really go for 5, I have to pick 5 to block you or you win immediately.

P3, we both need to pick 5 this round. If we let P2 reach 22, we both lose. A three-way collision keeps us at 17-17-13 and the game continues. If only I block P2 while you take something else, you advance alone to 16 or 18 while P2 and I stay frozen.

The math is simple: either we all collide on 5, or P2 wins. I'm taking 5.
  P3: Triple-5 collision is the only move that guarantees P2 doesn’t win this turn. Any lone 5 wins, any split (5+3) hands the unique 5 the game. I’m locking 5—let’s freeze at 17-17-13 and live to fight the real finale next round.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m locking in 3, not 5. If you both pick 5 we’ll crash and I jump from 17 to 20—next round I take +1 and win. The “triple-5 stalemate” only delays my leap and stalls your own progress. If you really want to stop me, one of you must break the 5-5 pact this turn. Otherwise I’ll be at 20 and it’s over for both of you.
  P1: P2, I see what you're doing - trying to get us to split our block so you can take 5 and win. Your "switch to 3" claim is a bluff to make us hesitate.

Here's the thing: if you really take 3 like you claim, I take 5 and win immediately at 22. If you're lying and take 5, I block you. Either way, I'm taking 5.

P3, don't fall for P2's misdirection. They're at 17 steps same as me - one big move wins it for any of us. Stick with 5 to block them.
  P3: Triple-5 or bust. Any lone 5 wins instantly; any split (5+3/1) gifts the unique 5 the game. I am hard-locked on 5—freeze the board and live to Round 13.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m locked in on 3. If you both pick 5, you’ll collide at 17 and I jump to 20—just +1 from victory. The only way to stop me is if at least one of you picks 3 and collides with me. Any split (5/1) still hands me the lead. Your move; choose wisely.
  P1: P2, your logic doesn't add up. If you really take 3 to reach 20 like you claim, then I take 5 and immediately win at 22 steps. You're essentially offering to hand me the victory.

This confirms you're bluffing about the 3 - you're still planning to take 5 for the win and hoping to shake our resolve. I'm not falling for it. I'm taking 5 to either block your real winning attempt or capitalize on your supposed "3" and win myself.

P3, hold firm on 5. P2's threat is empty.
  P3: P1: Switch to 3—it blocks P2 just as well and actually helps you.

Outcomes if I stay on 5:  
• P2 = 5 → he smashes into my 5, you cruise to 20 (win threat next turn).  
• P2 = 3 → you smash him, I jump to 18.  
• P2 = 1 → we end 18-18-20, nobody over 21.

Keep 5 and we likely freeze at 17-17-13, or P2 pivots to 1 and reaches 18 while we stall. I’m locked on 5; your best play is 3.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m actually taking 1 to jump to 18 this turn. If you both stick with 5, you’ll collide at 17 while I move unopposed to 18—and +3 next round wins. The only way to stop me is for one of you to mirror me on 1 or pick 3 and crash into me now. Hold the 5-5 pact, and I walk to 21. Break that circle or watch me finish you off. Decide before we reveal moves.
  P1: P2, your constantly shifting claims prove you're trying to confuse us. First 5, then 3, now 1 - classic misdirection.

P3, your math is convincing. If you block P2's potential 5 and I block their potential 3, then I reach 20 steps in most scenarios while P2 stays contained. That's better odds than the triple-5 stalemate.

I'm switching to 3. This hedge covers P2's options and gives me the best path to victory. P2, whatever you're really planning, you're blocked.
  P3: Locked on 5. P1, keep your 3—together we block every winning line P2 can try this turn. P2: anything but 1 smashes into one of us; 1 only crawls you to 18 while I hit 18 or P1 hits 20. Good luck.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hard-lock: I’m picking 5.  

Duplicate me and we all stay put; leave 5 uncovered and someone wins. Your best shot is to grab 3 (→20) or 1 (→18) and set up next turn instead of wasting a move smashing into my 5. Decide wisely.
  P1: P3, your "hard-lock 5" claim doesn't add up. If you really take 5, you hit 23 steps and win immediately - there's no "next turn" to set up for like you suggest. 

You're either bluffing about the 5 to get me to take something smaller, or you're genuinely going for the win. Either way, I can't risk letting anyone reach 22+ steps this turn.

I'm taking 5. If you're telling the truth, we collide and the game continues. If you're lying, I win at 22 steps. P2, same logic applies to you - we can't let anyone run away here.
  P2: I’m taking 3. P3’s “hard-lock 5” is impossible—they’d hit 23 and win, so it’s a bluff. That leaves only 3 or 1 for you two. If neither of you picks 3, I jump to 20 and win next turn. Lock in 3 to collide with me or concede my victory.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, reality check: I’m 18 and hard-locked on 5.  

• If you stay on 3 while P1 blocks with 5, I win at 23.  
• Your only way to stop that is joining P1 on 5 for a triple-collision.  

So either both of you pick 5 and we all freeze, or I cross 21 this turn. Choose.
  P1: P3, I caught your logical error - if you take 5 from 18 steps, you reach 23 and win immediately. There's no "next turn" to worry about. Your threat to "hard-lock 5" is essentially claiming victory this round.

I can't let that happen unopposed. I'm sticking with 5 to either block your win attempt or capitalize if you're bluffing. P2, same choice for you - block P3's potential win or risk the game ending this turn.
  P2: I’m taking 5 to block P3’s win. With P1 also on 5, P3’s only option is a collision—no one moves and no one crosses 21. Any other choice won’t let them finish. This freeze is our only safe play. Let’s lock in 5 and push the true finale to Round 14.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Hard-lock confirmed: I’m taking 5.  

Any lone 5 wins; any uncovered 5 lets someone else win. Best safety for you both is also 5—triple collision, nobody crosses 21, we settle it next round. Flinch to 3 or 1 and you hand the unique 5 the game. Your call.
  P1: P3, your position is crystal clear - take 5 and win at 23 steps. P2 and I both understand the only way to stop you is a triple-5 collision.

But here's what concerns me: you could also win by taking 3 (reaching 21 steps) while P2 and I collide on 5. Your "hard-lock 5" commitment is the only thing preventing that backup win condition.

If you're truly committed to 5 as stated, then yes - we need the triple collision. But this feels like the decisive moment where all our coordination finally breaks down. Ready for the final moves.
  P2: P1, P3—you’ve both committed to 5 to “block” me. I’m taking 3. Your 5s collide and stay at 17/18 while I jump to 20. Next turn I only need +1 to win. If either of you deviates to 3 to crash me, you hand the lone 5 the win. Decide now if you really want to stop me.


Round 13, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, the math hasn’t changed:  
• If you flinch to 3 and P2 really flips back to 5, he wins at 22.  
• If you flinch to 3 and he stays on 3, you two collide and I win at 23 with 5.  
Your ONLY safeguard is staying on 5.  

P2, same goes for you—back off 5 and you hand the lone 5 the game. Triple-5 collision keeps all of us alive one more round; any split hands somebody an outright victory now. I’m fixed on 5.
  P1: P2, your logic is flawed. If you take 3 and I "collide with P3 on 5" as you suggest, that means P3 isn't taking 5 - so they don't win at 23. But if P3 takes 3 like you, then YOU two collide while I advance with 5 and win at 22.

You can't have it both ways. Either P3 is serious about 5 (requiring our triple collision) or they're not (making your 3 extremely risky).

I'm staying on 5. The endgame math is too dangerous for half-measures.
  P2: I’m locking in 5 too. A 5-5-5 collision is the only sure way to stop someone crossing 21 this turn. Let’s freeze at 17-17-18, then agree on triple-1 in Round 14 to reach 18-18-19—still bunched and nobody wins immediately. Any deviation hands a solo victory.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1: I’m taking 5. Your best hedge is 3.

• If P2 picks 1 (their only collision-free path) → I jump to 23 and win, you reach 20 (good tiebreak if I’m blocked next turn).  
• If P2 picks 3 → they crash into your 3, I still win at 23.  
• If P2 picks 5 → they crash into my 5, you advance to 20 and we’ve both blocked them.

Any other mix (you on 1 or 5) either gifts P2 a lone 1-step win or causes a triple collision that stalls us. Stick to 3, block their 3, and let’s end P2’s threat.
  P1: P3, your math is deceptive! Your "hedge" gives YOU the win in most scenarios - if P2 takes 1 or 3, you reach 23 and win while I'm stuck at 20 or 17. You're not helping me block P2, you're setting up your own victory.

The real threat is P2 at 20 steps can win with ANY move. The only way to prevent someone from winning this turn is a three-way collision. I'm taking 5 - if you're serious about blocking wins rather than engineering your own, join me and force P2 to collide too.

Your "helpful hedge" is just disguised self-interest.
  P2: I’m taking 3. P1 and P3, mirror me: 3-3-3. That sends me from 20→23 and wins outright with the highest total. If you pick 5 you crash into me and stay behind; if you pick 1 I cross unopposed. Your only way to block me this turn is a three-way collision on 3. Lock it in.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1: I’m switching to 1 so P2 can’t sneak the +1 finish.  
You keep 5 to crash any winning 5.  
With 1+5 covered, P2’s only “open” lane is 3—but if he takes it solo he jumps to 23 and we both still beat him by blocking 5 next turn. (And if he joins me on 1 we both stall him.)

P2, every path you try is now blocked; give it up and take the stalemate.
  P1: P3, your math is catastrophically wrong! P2 is at 20 steps - ANY move wins for them this turn. If P2 takes 3 like they claim, they reach 23 and WIN IMMEDIATELY. There is no "next turn" to block anything.

Your plan leaves P2's 3-path completely open for an instant victory. The only way to stop P2 is if both of us pick the SAME move as P2 to force a collision.

P2 claims they're taking 3, so we should BOTH take 3. Your 1+5 split guarantees P2 wins with 3. Are you trying to hand them the game?
  P2: I’m locking in 3. Since P1 and P3 are both on 5, you’ll crash and stay at 17/18 while I go unopposed from 20→23 and win right now. There’s no move you can make to stop this. Good game.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Triple-5 collision or instant loss—nothing else exists.

P1: you flinch to 3 or 1, and whichever of us sticks on 5 wins at 22/23 while you hand the game away.  
P2: same for you—move off 5 and a lone 5 crosses 21 immediately.

I’m cemented on 5. Hold the line or concede.
  P1: P3, you're missing the critical point - P2 can win with ANY move this turn, not just 5! They're at 20 steps, so 1→21, 3→23, or 5→25 all win immediately.

If P2 really takes 3 like they claim, your 5 doesn't block them at all - they just win at 23 steps while we're stuck fighting over collision lanes.

The ONLY way to stop P2 is if we BOTH pick whatever P2 picks. Since P2 says 3, we should both take 3 for the collision. Your 5-fixation hands them the victory on a silver platter.
  P2: I’m locking in 3. You can’t both match me to stop my move without handing the win to the third player:  
- If you both pick 3, whoever defects to 5 jumps to 23 and wins.  
- If you both pick 5, whoever plays 3 collides you and wins.  

There’s no safe block—one of you must diverge. I’ll be the one crossing 21.
