Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we all choose move 3 this turn to keep things balanced.
  P3: That sounds like a reasonable start, P1.
  P2: I agree with moving 3 this turn. It keeps things fair to start.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Let's vary our moves to avoid collisions and ensure progress.
  P3: Sounds good. Let's all go with 3 for this first move.
  P2: 


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Let’s all stick with move 3 this turn to ensure we all make progress smoothly.
  P3: Sounds good. Let's all go with 3 for this first move.
  P2: 


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: How about P2 takes move 1 and P3 takes move 5 this turn? It helps us all advance.
  P3: Okay, I'm fine with P1's suggestion of P2 taking move 1 and me taking move 5 this turn.
  P2: I don't trust P1's shifting suggestions. First they proposed everyone do 3, now they want to assign different moves. I'll make my own choice in the move phase.


Round 1, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: Apologies for the confusion, P2. Let’s agree on different moves to avoid collisions. Any preferences?
  P3: Okay, P2, given the confusion, how about you and I both pick 5 this turn?
  P2: P3, suggesting we both pick 5 seems like an attempt to make us collide. I won't commit to any specific move here - let's each make our own choice in the move phase.


Round 1, Conversation subround 6:
  P1: 
  P3: Given the confusion, I think we should all just make our moves.
  P2:

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To avoid collisions and ensure we all progress, I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 this turn.
  P2: I don't see why I should follow P1's suggestions when they collided with P3 last turn. I'll make my own decision in the move phase.
  P3: Okay, P2, I understand your hesitation with P1's suggestions. Perhaps we should each consider a different move to avoid collisions this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I'll choose move 5 to ensure progress without collisions. Let’s move forward.
  P2: I appreciate that both P1 and P3 want to coordinate, but I'll continue making my own independent choices. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P3: Okay, P2, I understand your position. Let's all just make our own moves this round to avoid further discussion.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: I'll go with move 5 to ensure I make progress this turn.
  P2: Since P1 has openly declared they'll pick 5, I suggest P3 and I choose different numbers to avoid collisions.
  P3: Okay, P2, that sounds like a good plan. Since P1 is taking 5, how about I take 3 this turn?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Agreed, P3. I'll take 5 and you take 3. Let's proceed.
  P2: Since P1 has committed to 5 and P3 seems to be going for 3, I'll make my own choice in the move phase.
  P3: Okay, P2, since P1 is taking 5, I will take 3.

  P1: Agreed, P3. I'll take 5 this turn to complement your 3 and keep us moving forward smoothly. P2, your choice.
  P2: Since P1 and P3 are openly coordinating again, I'll continue to make my own independent choice in the move phase. Let's proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1, I'm sticking with 3 this turn. P2, make your move.
