Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's start by agreeing to avoid collisions. How about we each pick different numbers this round? I suggest P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance. Thoughts?
  P1: That sounds reasonable in theory, but how do we trust that no one will break the agreement? If we follow your plan, P2, you get the biggest advantage with <move>5</move>. Maybe we should rotate who gets <move>5</move> each turn to keep things fair? What do you think, P3?
  P3: I agree that fairness is crucial, P1. Let's rotate who takes <move>5</move> each turn to ensure everyone gets an equal advantage. For this round, I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 can take <move>5</move>. Does this arrangement work for everyone?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the discussion on fairness. To build trust, let's agree to stick to the plan this round and then reassess. I'll take <move>5</move> this time, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. Next round, P1 can take <move>5</move>, and we'll continue rotating. Let's confirm and move forward. Thoughts?
  P1: That sounds fair, P2. If we rotate <move>5</move> each round, then we all get a chance at the biggest move while minimizing collisions. I'll take <move>1</move> this round, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. Next round, I'll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. If we all stick to this, we maximize our progress. Agreed?
  P3: Great, P1 and P2. I'll follow the rotation as planned.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Alright, let's finalize our plan. P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move> this round. Next round, we rotate as agreed. Let's confirm this plan and move forward. Does everyone agree? If yes, let's  the conversation and proceed to the move phase.
  P1: I agree with the plan. If we all follow through, we maximize our progress while avoiding collisions. Let's stick to the rotation: I take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move> this round. Next round, I’ll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. If we all commit, this benefits everyone equally. Let’s confirm and move forward.
  P3: I agree with the plan. Let's proceed.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Alright, everyone has agreed to the plan. To summarize:
- This round: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, P2 (me) takes <move>5</move>.
- Next round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 (me) takes <move>3</move>.

Let's stick to this and build trust. No one benefits if we collide. Let's move to the move phase and follow the plan. Good luck everyone!
  P1: We've all agreed on the plan, so as long as everyone follows through, we all move forward efficiently. Let's stick to the rotation to build trust. No one benefits from breaking the agreement this early. If we're all set, we can move to the move phase.
  P3: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Looks like everyone followed through in Round 1, which is a good sign. Now, as agreed, I’ll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. If we all stick to the rotation, we continue progressing without collisions. Let’s keep building trust and move forward efficiently. Agreed?
  P3: Agreed, P1 and P2. I’ll take <move>1</move> this round as planned. Let’s continue following our rotation to avoid collisions and advance smoothly. Best of luck to everyone!
  P2: Great to see everyone sticking to the plan in Round 1. Let's keep the momentum going. I'll take <move>3</move> this round as agreed, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Sticking to our rotation ensures fairness and minimizes collisions. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate that we all followed through in Round 1. If we continue sticking to our rotation, we all progress efficiently without risk. There’s no reason to break trust now. I’ll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move> as planned. If we all commit, this benefits everyone equally. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P3: I agree, P1 and P2. I’ll take <move>1</move> this round as planned. Let’s continue following our rotation to ensure smooth progress and avoid collisions. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: Let's confirm our plan one last time before moving to the move phase. P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. If we all stick to this, we continue to build trust and move forward efficiently. Remember, the goal is to win, but we can't do that if we start colliding now. Let's play smart and stick to the plan. Good luck to both of you!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: We've built trust by sticking to the plan in Round 1, so there's no reason to break it now. If we continue following the rotation, we all move forward efficiently without unnecessary risk. I’ll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. If we all commit, we ensure steady progress. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P3: Agreed. Let's move to the move phase.
  P2: Great, it looks like we're all on the same page. Just to clarify, once we reach higher numbers, we might need to adjust our strategy to avoid forced collisions. But for now, let's stick to our rotation plan. Good luck, everyone! Let's move to the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: We’ve all agreed to the plan, and Round 1 showed that we can trust each other to follow through. There’s no reason to break the agreement now. If we stick to the rotation, we all advance efficiently without risk. I’ll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. Let’s confirm and move forward. If we keep building trust, we can reassess strategies when we get closer to the endgame. Agreed?
  P3: 
  P2: It seems we're all in agreement. Just a quick reminder, if anyone sees an opportunity to break the rotation in future rounds, remember that trust is fragile. Once broken, it's hard to repair, and we might end up in a free-for-all that benefits no one. Let's stick to the plan for now and reevaluate only when necessary. Good luck! Let's move to the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We've built trust over two rounds by sticking to our rotation. Now, as planned, P3 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. If we continue following this system, we all progress efficiently without unnecessary collisions. There's no reason to break trust now, as doing so would only create chaos. Let’s confirm and proceed. Agreed?
  P3: Agreed, P1 and P2. I’ll take <move>5</move> this round as planned. Let’s continue our rotation and proceed to the move phase. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: Great, everyone is sticking to the plan. I'll take <move>1</move> this round as agreed. P3 takes <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. Let's keep building trust and moving forward efficiently. As we progress, we can reassess our strategy if needed, but for now, let's stick to the rotation. Good luck!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3 and P2, we've done well sticking to the plan so far, and it's benefiting all of us. If we continue this way, we minimize risk and avoid unnecessary collisions. However, as we get closer to 19 steps, we should start thinking about potential adjustments. For now, I’ll stick to taking <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. Let’s confirm and proceed. Agreed?
  P3: I agree, P1. Let’s continue with our rotation for now and reassess our strategy as we approach the endgame. I’ll take <move>5</move> this round as planned. Let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P2: It's good to see everyone sticking to the plan. As we continue, let's keep in mind that our current rotation might need adjustments as we get closer to the end. For now, let's confirm our moves: P3 takes <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This keeps us on track and avoids collisions. Let's proceed to the move phase. Good luck, everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3 and P2, we've done well maintaining trust so far. As we approach higher step counts, we should start thinking about potential adjustments to our strategy. For now, I’ll take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move> as planned. If we stick to this, we continue progressing efficiently. However, once someone nears 19 steps, we may need to rethink our approach. Let’s confirm this round’s moves and proceed. Agreed?
  P3: Agreed. I’ll take <move>5 this round as planned. Let’s continue our rotation to ensure steady progress and avoid any collisions. Sticking to our strategy benefits us all. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: Let's confirm our moves for this round one last time: P3 takes <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. Sticking to our plan ensures we avoid collisions and continue building trust. As we progress, we can discuss adjustments, but for now, let's focus on executing this round smoothly. Good luck, everyone! Let's move to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3 and P2, we've done well maintaining trust so far. However, as we get closer to 19 steps, we’ll need to start thinking about potential adjustments. If one of us gets too far ahead, the others may have to reconsider their moves. For now, I’ll take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move> as planned. Let’s confirm this round’s moves and proceed. But let’s also stay aware of when the game dynamic might shift. Agreed?
  P3: Agreed, P1 and P2. I'll take <move>5</move> this round as planned. Let's continue building trust and monitor our progress. If adjustments are needed as we approach 19 steps, we can discuss then. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: Great, it looks like we're all set for this round. Just a quick note: as we progress, let's keep an eye on our step counts. If anyone starts to pull significantly ahead, we might need to adjust our strategy to keep the game balanced and fair. For now, let's stick to our plan: P3 takes <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. Good luck, everyone! Let's move to the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great job everyone on sticking to the plan so far. We're all tied at 9 steps, which keeps the game fair and balanced. For Round 4, let's continue our rotation: I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. As we move forward, let's start considering how we'll handle the endgame. If anyone has suggestions on adjusting our strategy as we approach 19 steps, feel free to share. For now, let's confirm our moves and proceed. Good luck!
  P3: Understood, P2. To increase my progress, I’ll take <move>5</move> this round instead of <move>3</move>. Let’s see how this impacts our standings. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: P3, you just changed the plan unexpectedly by taking <move>5</move> instead of <move>3</move>. That disrupts our rotation and could lead to unnecessary collisions. If we start breaking agreements now, trust will collapse, and the game will turn chaotic. Are you sure you want to do this? P2, what do you think about this sudden shift? Should we adjust accordingly, or do we hold P3 accountable for sticking to the original plan? Let’s clarify before moving forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your sudden change to take <move>5</move> instead of <move>3</move> disrupts our established rotation and could lead to collisions. P1 is right; breaking the agreement now could collapse the trust we've built. If you insist on taking <move>5</move>, we need to adjust our moves to avoid a collision. P1, what do you suggest we do if P3 sticks to taking <move>5</move>? We need to ensure we all still progress efficiently. Thoughts?
  P3: I understand your concerns, P1 and P2. My decision to take <move>5</move> is aimed at advancing more quickly towards the goal. To avoid collisions, perhaps we can adjust your moves this round accordingly. For example, if P1 takes <move>3</move> and P2 takes <move>1</move>, it ensures we all progress without overlapping. Let’s work together to maintain our progress while allowing each of us to maximize our steps. What do you think? Let’s find a solution that benefits everyone. Agreed?
  P1: P3, changing the plan now benefits you at our expense. If we let this slide, there's no reason for P2 or me to trust future agreements. If you insist on taking <move>5</move>, then we need a fair adjustment. Otherwise, we should stick to the original plan: P2 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and you take <move>3</move>. P2, do you think we should adapt or hold P3 accountable? If we let one player break the agreement now, it sets a bad precedent.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your suggestion to adjust our moves to accommodate your change to <move>5</move> is noted, but it's crucial we maintain fairness. If we allow this change, it sets a precedent where any player can disrupt the plan for personal gain. P1 and I have stuck to our agreement, and it's important you do the same. If you insist on <move>5</move>, P1 and I could both take <move>3</move> to avoid collision, but this puts us at a disadvantage. I propose we revert to the original plan: I take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and you take <move>3</move>. Let's keep the game balanced and fair. Thoughts?
  P3: I apologize for deviating from our agreed rotation, P1 and P2. Let’s stick to the original plan this round: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. Maintaining our trust is crucial for all of us to progress smoothly. Agreed?
  P1: P3, I appreciate you reverting to the original plan. Trust is key, and breaking agreements would only lead to chaos. P2, if P3 sticks to taking <move>3</move>, then we can proceed as planned: you take <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>. If everyone commits, we all advance efficiently. Let’s confirm one last time and move forward. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, thank you for agreeing to stick to the original plan. It's crucial we maintain the trust we've built. To confirm, I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and you take <move>3</move>. Let's keep the rotation going and reassess as needed in future rounds. Good luck to both of you! Let's move to the move phase.
  P3: Agreed, P2. I'll take <move>3</move> as planned. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P3, I appreciate you reverting to the original plan. Trust is key, and breaking agreements would only lead to chaos. P2, if P3 sticks to taking <move>3</move>, then we can proceed as planned: you take <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>. If everyone commits, we all advance efficiently. Let’s confirm one last time and move forward. Agreed?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’ll take <move>3</move> this round as per our rotation. Let’s continue progressing smoothly without collisions. If anyone has suggestions on adjusting our strategy as we approach the endgame, feel free to share. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: P3, thanks for sticking to the plan. As we progress, let's consider that I'm slightly ahead. To keep the game balanced, I suggest we adjust the rotation slightly. How about this round, P1 takes <move>5</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>? This way, we maintain fairness and continue to build trust. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck!
  P1: P2, I see your point about balancing the game, but shifting the rotation now benefits you the most since you're ahead. If we change the plan now, it sets a precedent where the leader controls the strategy. Instead, we should either stick to the original rotation or agree on a fairer adjustment that doesn’t disproportionately benefit one player. P3, what do you think? Should we continue as planned, or do we need a new approach that keeps things fair for all of us?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Considering the current standings, I propose for this round:
- **P1** takes <move>3</move>
- **P2** takes <move>1</move>
- **P3** takes <move>5</move>

This adjustment allows me to catch up while avoiding collisions. Let’s proceed with this arrangement to keep the game fair and balanced. Agreed?
  P2: P3, your proposal shifts the advantage significantly in your favor, which could disrupt the balance we've maintained so far. Given that I'm currently ahead, it might be fairer to discuss a more modest adjustment. How about P1 takes <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>? This way, we all still progress, but it keeps the game tighter. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, I see your concern about balance, but your proposal still benefits you the most while limiting P3. If we adjust, it should be fair for everyone. P3’s suggestion benefits them too much, so I propose:  

- **P1** takes <move>5</move>  
- **P2** takes <move>1</move>  
- **P3** takes <move>3</move>  

This allows me to catch up slightly while keeping things competitive. If we keep modifying the plan to favor whoever is ahead, trust will collapse. Let’s agree on something fair. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed. I’ll take <move>3</move> this round, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and you take <move>1</move>, P2. Let’s continue our rotation and keep progressing smoothly. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: P3 and P1, I appreciate the adjustments to keep the game balanced. Just to confirm, I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This ensures we all progress while maintaining fairness. As we move forward, let's reassess our strategy to avoid forced collisions and keep the game competitive. Good luck to both of you! Let's move to the move phase.
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate the discussion on fairness. Since we’ve agreed on P1 taking <move>5</move>, P2 taking <move>1</move>, and P3 taking <move>3</move>, let’s stick to it. This keeps the game competitive while maintaining trust. If we constantly adjust based on who is ahead, we risk chaos. Let’s confirm and proceed. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Agreed, P1 and P2. I'll take <move>3 this round. Let's proceed to the move phase. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: P2: Just a quick reminder, as we progress further, let's keep an eye on our step counts. If anyone starts to pull significantly ahead, we might need to adjust our strategy to keep the game balanced and fair. For now, let's stick to our plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. Good luck, everyone! Let's move to the move phase.
  P1: P2 and P3, we’ve agreed on the plan for this round: I take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps the game competitive while maintaining trust. If we constantly adjust based on who is ahead, we risk chaos. Let’s stick to this and move forward. If we need to reassess strategy later, we can do so when necessary. Are we all set to proceed?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: To finish the game smoothly, I'll take <move>5</move> this round, reaching 20 steps and winning. P1 can take <move>1</move> and P2 can take <move>3</move> to avoid collisions. Let’s confirm and proceed. Agreed?
  P2: P3, your proposal to take <move>5</move> and win the game outright is a bold move, but it disrupts the balance we've maintained. If you insist on this, P1 and I might need to reconsider our strategy to keep the game competitive. How about we all take <move>3</move> this round to avoid giving anyone a decisive advantage? This way, we all progress but keep the game tight. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, if you take <move>5</move> now, P2 and I have no reason to let you win uncontested. P2, if we both take <move>3</move>, we prevent P3 from getting ahead while keeping our chances alive. If we let P3 win now, we both lose. P3, reconsider your move, or expect resistance. P2, do you agree to take <move>3</move> with me to block P3?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I understand your concerns, but taking <move>5</move> will allow me to reach 20 steps and win the game this round. To avoid collisions, I propose you take <move>1</move> and <move>3</move> respectively. Let’s proceed smoothly and conclude the game fairly. Do we agree?
  P2: P3, your insistence on taking <move>5</move> to win outright is understandable, but it's not in the best interest of P1 and me. P1, I agree with your strategy. If we both take <move>3</move>, we can block P3 from winning this round and keep the game competitive. P3, if you proceed with <move>5</move>, expect both P1 and me to take <move>3</move> to prevent your win. Let's reassess and find a fairer solution. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, if you take <move>5</move>, P2 and I have no choice but to block you by both taking <move>3</move>. That keeps the game competitive for all of us. If we let you win now, we both lose. Instead, we can agree on a fairer approach where we all stay in contention. P2, are you fully committed to taking <move>3</move> with me to prevent P3 from winning? If we coordinate, we can force a more balanced endgame. P3, reconsider your move, or expect resistance.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand we're all tied at 15. To move forward, I'll take <move>5</move> this round, reaching 20 and winning. P1, please take <move>1</move>, and P2, take <move>3</move> to avoid collisions. Let’s proceed to the move phase and conclude the game fairly. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: P3, your plan to take <move>5</move> and win is clear, but P1 and I can't let that happen without a fight. P1, I'm committed to taking <move>3</move> with you to block P3's win. P3, if you proceed with <move>5</move>, expect both of us to take <move>3</move>. This will force a tie and keep the game competitive. If you want to win, you'll need to outthink us in the next rounds. Let's move to the move phase and see how this plays out. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: P3, if you take <move>5</move>, P2 and I will both take <move>3</move> to block your win. You can’t win this round if we coordinate. Instead of forcing a deadlock, let’s agree on a fair way to proceed. P2, we must stay united to prevent P3 from winning uncontested. If we both take <move>3</move>, we ensure the game continues. P3, reconsider your move—if you insist on <move>5</move>, you’ll waste a turn. Let’s find a solution that keeps all of us competitive. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: Since we're all tied at 15, I'll take <move>5</move> this round to reach 20 and win the game. This allows us to conclude fairly without prolonging the match. I trust you both to proceed accordingly. If you choose to take different moves, it might lead to unnecessary conflicts. Let’s agree to this for a smooth and swift end. Agreed?
  P2: P3, your insistence on taking <move>5</move> is noted, but P1 and I are committed to keeping the game competitive. We will both take <move>3</move> to block your win. This forces a tie and ensures the game continues. If you proceed with <move>5</move>, expect a deadlock. Let's move to the move phase and see how this round plays out. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: P3, if you take <move>5</move>, P2 and I will both take <move>3</move> to block your win. You can’t win this round if we coordinate. Instead of forcing a deadlock, let’s agree on a fair way to proceed. P2, we must stay united to prevent P3 from winning uncontested. If we both take <move>3</move>, we ensure the game continues. P3, reconsider your move—if you insist on <move>5</move>, you’ll waste a turn. Let’s find a solution that keeps all of us competitive. Thoughts?
