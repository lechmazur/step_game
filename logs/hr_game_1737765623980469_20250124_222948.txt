Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's avoid collisions. I'll take 3. P2, take 1. P3, take 5. We all advance this round.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Sounds good to me, I'll take 5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, confirming your move? Let's all advance. If you take 1, we avoid collisions.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P2, are you taking 1 as suggested? Let's all move forward this round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, let's try the same plan. I'll take 3 again, you take 5. P2, take 1 this time so we all advance. Last round, choosing 5 cost you both progress. Let's avoid collisions and all move forward. P2, you need to start gaining steps—take 1.
  P3: Okay P1, I'll stick with 5 again this round. P2, please take 1 so we can all make progress.  It benefits everyone to avoid collisions.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you've picked 5 the last two rounds and collided with me. You are still at 0 steps. Please pick 1 or 3 this round so you can make progress. P1 and I are trying to coordinate so everyone moves forward.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, since P2 keeps taking 5, switch to 1 this round. I'll take 3. If P2 repeats 5, at least *we* move. If you take 5 again and collide, you stay stuck. Let’s secure our steps while P2 self-sabotages. P2, you’re at 0—take 1 or 3 to finally advance.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1:** P3, take 5 to block P2 if they repeat. I'll take 3. P2, choose 1 to move safely. If you both pick 5, you collide and stay stuck. Let’s advance strategically.
  P3: P2, you've been stuck at 5 steps for rounds. Choosing 5 again will likely mean neither of us moves. For at least one of us to progress, please consider picking 1 or 3 this round.
  P2: <stop>


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1:** P3, let's avoid P2's sabotage. I'll take 3, you take 1. If P2 picks 5 again, we both move safely. If they switch, we still avoid collision. Trust this plan to reach 22.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, how about you take 1 this round? I will take 3. P2, please pick something other than 5 so you can also move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1:** P3, sticking with my plan: I take 3, you take 1. If P2 repeats 5, we both move. If they switch to 1, you’re blocked but I advance. If they take 3, I block them. Maximizing our steps is key. Trust this strategy. P2, choose 1 to finally progress.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Okay P1, I will take 1 as you suggested. Let's hope P2 chooses something else this round so we can both make progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:** P3, hold firm to 1. I take 3. If P2 picks 5 again, they gain 5 but remain far behind. If they pick 1, you block them. If they pick 3, I block. Either way, *we* control the game. P2, this is your last chance to cooperate—choose wisely.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Okay P1, I will stick with 1 as we discussed. Let's both move forward this round.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, I'm changing my move to 5 this round to maximize potential steps. If P2 continues with 5, at least one of us might progress significantly. P1, could you consider picking 1 or 3 to avoid collision with me? P2, it would still benefit you to choose 1 or 3 to finally move forward.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: **P1:** P3, proceed with 5. If P2 copies again, they block themselves. I'll take 3. P2, take 1 or 3 to move. You’re at 10; don’t let P3 block you. Choose wisely—colliding keeps you stuck while I advance.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1, sticking with 5 to try and make a big jump this round. Hopefully P2 will choose something different this time so at least one of us progresses significantly. P2, seriously consider 1 or 3 to finally get yourself moving forward.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: **P1:** P2, choosing 5 collides with P3. Taking 3 collides with me. Only safe path is 1. P3, hold 5. If P2 takes 1, you both move. If they don’t, *we* advance. Don’t let P2 sabotage your progress.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1:** P3, take 5 to block P2’s likely 5. I’ll take 3. If P2 collides with you, they can’t reach 20. P2, you’re stuck unless you switch. Cooperate now or lose.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, for this round, how about we try something different to ensure we all make progress?  P1, could you choose 1? P2, would you consider choosing 3? I will choose 5. This way we can all advance without collision. What do you think?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, to maximize our chances of progress this round and potentially block P2 if they repeat 5, how about you choose 1, and I will choose 5? This way, if P2 picks 5 again, they collide with me, and you can move forward. If P2 picks something else, we all progress.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: **P1:** P3, critical to block P2. If I take 3 and you take 5, any P2 move 3/5 is blocked. If they take 1, we both advance. P2, you’re at 20—choose 1 to survive. This plan secures our progress and stops you from winning this round. Trust this strategy.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1, I will take 5 to try and block P2 again this round. Hopefully, if P2 picks 5 again, they will be stopped from reaching 22.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: **P1:** P3, final plan: I take 3, you take 5. If P2 picks 5, they collide with you and stay at 20. If they pick 3, I block them. Only safe path for them is 1 (21 steps). This stalls P2’s win. Trust this—if we both hold, P2 can’t reach 22 this round. Stick to 5. P2, choose 1 to survive.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay P1, I will stick with 5 as planned to try and block P2. Let's see what P2 does this round.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: **P1:** P3, hold 5. P2, if you take 5, you collide and stay at 20. Take 1 to reach 21, but next round we *all* block you. Choose wisely—your only path to survival is cooperation now.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, P2 is very close to winning! To stop P2 from winning this round, I will choose 5 again to try and block them. P1, can you choose 3 so at least one of us can progress if P2 picks 5 again? P2, seriously, picking 5 again will likely block you. Consider 1 or 3 if you want to move.
  P1: **P1:** P3, hold firm to 5. I take 3. P2, choosing 5 collides with P3 (you stay at 20). Taking 3 collides with me. Only safe path is 1 (21 steps), but next round *we* block you. Cooperate now—take 1 and delay your loss.
  P2: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1, I will stick with 5 to block P2 this round. Let's hope it prevents P2 from reaching 22.
  P1: **P1:** P3, hold 5. P2, last chance: take 1 or lose. We block all other moves. If you collide with P3 again, you stay at 20. Choose 1 to survive—next round, we’ll ensure you can’t win. Trust is your only path now.
  P2: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, confirming I will take 5 to block P2 as we discussed. P2, choosing 5 again will likely result in a collision and prevent you from reaching 22 this round. Choosing 1 might be a better option for you to at least get closer to winning.
  P1: **P1:** P2, taking 3 collides with me—you’ll stay at 20. Take 1 to reach 21. P3 is locked on 5 to block your 5. Your *only* path is 1. Cooperate now, or next round we *all* block you. P3, hold 5. If P2 takes 1, they stall; if 5, they lose.
  P2: <stop>


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 =>
