Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <move>5</move> might be risky if others copy. Let's coordinate: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This way we all advance safely. Deal?
  P3: That works for me. But let's be clear: if any two of us pick the same number, we all lose out. So I’m willing to go along with the 1-3-5 plan this time if you both keep to it. Let’s trust each other.
  P2: I agree with the plan, but let's ensure we stick to it. Trust is key, so let's give it a shot this round. I'll choose <move>3</move> as agreed. Remember, if anyone deviates, it could backfire for all of us. Let's make this work.


Round 1, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great job sticking to the plan, everyone. We all advanced safely. Let's consider doing the same strategy again this round. I'll take <move>3</move> again, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we maintain trust and continue progressing without collisions. What do you both think?
  P3: I’m good with staying on the 1–3–5 plan again. Trust is working so far, and I’ll pick 5 as before. Let’s keep moving.
  P1: P1: Agreed, let's keep the 1-3-5 strategy to avoid collisions. Trust is vital here. Once we’re closer to 20, we can discuss adjustments. For now, safety first.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm glad we're all on the same page and maintaining trust with the 1-3-5 plan. It's working well so far, and we’re progressing smoothly. Let's stick to this strategy for now, and we can reassess if needed once we're closer to the finish line. Remember, any deviation could set us back, so let's keep the momentum going. Looking forward to a successful round!
  P3: I’m still on board with our 1-3-5 approach. It’s working nicely, and there’s no need to rock the boat. Let’s stick to it and maintain our trust this round.
  P1: Agreed, let’s maintain the 1-3-5 strategy this round to avoid collisions. Trust is essential—any deviation risks stalling us all. Let’s keep this disciplined approach until we’re near 20. Consistency now ensures progress.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:

  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great teamwork so far, everyone! We've made consistent progress with the 1-3-5 strategy, and we're still in a good position. Let's stick to this plan for Round 3 as well: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we continue advancing safely without collisions. Trust has been key, so let's keep it up and reassess our strategy once we're closer to the finish line. Looking forward to another successful round!
  P1: P1: Agreed to continue the 1-3-5 strategy this round to maintain safety. However, as P3 approaches the finish line, we should prepare to adjust our steps in future rounds to ensure fair competition. Let’s keep trust intact now but stay flexible later.
  P3: I’m content to continue the 1-3-5 plan for now if we all stick to it. We’ve built trust, and it’s helping us move forward smoothly. However, I’m already at 10 steps, so I want to remain transparent: I’ll pick 5 again this round, but let’s keep communicating openly if our positions shift.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you're progressing quickly, so we should consider adjusting our strategy soon to keep things fair. For this round, let's stick to the 1-3-5 plan, but we may need to reassess in the next round to ensure everyone has a fair chance. P1, P3, are you both still on board with this plan for now? Let's maintain trust and communication.
  P1: Agreed to stick with the 1-3-5 plan this round. However, to keep the race fair as P3 approaches 20, let’s **rotate steps in Round 4**: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This balances our progress and ensures everyone stays competitive. Thoughts?
  P3: I’m willing to keep the 1-3-5 plan for Round 3 to maintain trust. That’s worked well so far, and then we can revisit P1’s idea of rotating next round. Let’s confirm we keep the same assignments this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our cooperation so far, and I agree to stick with the 1-3-5 plan for this round. P3, your progress is impressive, so I support P1's idea to rotate steps in Round 4 to keep things fair. This round, let's maintain our current assignments: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's ensure we all advance safely and reassess the strategy in the next round. Trust and communication have been key, so let's keep it up!
  P1: Agreed. Let’s proceed with the 1-3-5 plan this round as agreed: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>. Trust is non-negotiable now—any deviation risks stalling us all. We’ll rotate steps in Round 4 as discussed to keep the race fair. Let’s execute flawlessly this round.
  P3: I’m still fully on board with the 1-3-5 approach for this round. We’re building trust and moving steadily. I’ll pick 5 again if you both stick to your parts. Next round, I’m open to rotations or any adjustments we agree on, but let’s secure our progress now. No need to risk a collision yet.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m close to 20, so I understand the concern about keeping it fair. I’m willing to rotate now, as proposed: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I’ll pick 1 this round. Let’s keep trust intact and avoid collisions. Then we can revisit our positions next turn. Does that sound good?
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the suggestion to rotate steps this round. It’s a fair approach to keep the game competitive. I’ll take <move>5</move> as agreed, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let’s maintain our trust and adapt as needed in future rounds. Agreed?
  P1: P1: Agreed to the rotation plan for fairness. Let’s **confirm**: I take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps us all advancing without collision. **Trust is critical here**—if anyone strays, we all risk stalling. P3, your <move>1</move> shows sportsmanship; let’s honor that. Execute precisely, and we’ll adjust again next round based on updated positions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m on board. Let’s finalize the rotation: I’ll pick <move>1</move>, P1 picks <move>3</move>, and P2 picks <move>5</move>. Trust remains crucial—if we collide, we gain nothing. Let’s follow through as agreed and reflect on next steps once we see where we stand after this round.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm glad we're all on board with the rotation plan for this round. This keeps things fair and ensures no collisions. I'll take <move>5</move> as agreed, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Let's execute precisely and reassess our positions next round. Trust is crucial; let's maintain it and adapt as needed. Looking forward to another successful round!
  P1: P1: Confirmed—let’s execute the rotation *exactly* as agreed: I take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Trust is non-negotiable here—any deviation risks collision and halts us all. P3, your <move>1</move> keeps the race fair (advancing to 16 while we catch up). Let’s honor this pact. After this round, we can adjust strategies transparently. No hidden moves—our progress depends on it.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we've done well maintaining trust and adapting our strategy. With P3 at 16 steps, we should ensure fairness while progressing. I propose this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps us advancing without collisions and maintains balance. Let’s execute this plan and reassess next round. Agreed?
  P3: I’m okay with the plan you suggested, P2. Let’s keep it simple: P1 picks 5, you pick 1, and I’ll pick 3. I’ll trust both of you to stick with it so we can all advance without collisions. After this round, we can re-evaluate based on our new positions. Let’s finalize this and stay coordinated.
  P1: P1: Let’s avoid letting P3 reach 19 this round. Instead, I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps us competitive: P3 stays at 17, P2 jumps to 19, and I reach 9. Fair play ensures no one clinches victory prematurely. What say you?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need to keep the game competitive and balanced. P1, your suggestion helps maintain fairness, and I agree it’s important not to let anyone pull too far ahead. For this round, I’ll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps us all in the race and ensures no premature victory. Let’s stick to this plan and reassess in the next round. Trust and fair play are essential. Agreed?
  P3: I’m comfortable with this plan: P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, and I’ll choose 1. That keeps us moving without clashes. Let’s finalize and reevaluate next round.
  P1: P3, your current lead demands accountability—let’s lock in P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 as finalized. P2’s move to 19 keeps pressure on you, while I stay viable. If you deviate to 3 or 5, you risk collision *or* letting P2 win next round. Trust this math: sticking ensures your safest path. P2, confirm you’ll hold to 5—any last-minute shift to 1 or 3 dooms us all. Let’s execute flawlessly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our ongoing cooperation and strategy adjustments. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 3, I'll take 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the game balanced and ensures no premature victory. Trust is crucial, and deviating risks collision or unwanted outcomes. Let's execute this round as agreed and reassess next round based on our new positions. Looking forward to a successful round!
  P3: I’m willing to finalize the plan: I’ll pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. That puts me at 17, P2 at 19, and P1 at 9. Next round, we must coordinate carefully so nobody crosses 20 uncontested. Let’s stick to our trust—if anyone deviates, we risk stalling or handing someone else the victory. Once we see the new positions, we can plan a fair final push. Agreed?
  P1: P2, P3: **Stick to the agreed moves—your deviation risks collision.** P2’s 5 keeps them at 19, poised to finish next round. P3’s 1 advances to 17, but any last-minute shift to 3/5 could collide with P2’s 5 or my 3. P1’s 3 ensures minimal progress while trusting you both. Let’s execute flawlessly—next round’s the showdown.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your last-round betrayal cost us all progress. Let’s reset: I’ll take <move>5</move> to 14, P2 takes <move>3</move> to 17, and you take <move>1</move> to 17. This keeps the race fair. If you refuse, I’ll block your path by picking 5 again—forcing collision. Trust is dead; survival now depends on mutual restraint. P2, confirm you’ll hold to 3?
  P3: P1, I understand your frustration. Let’s put the collision behind us and move forward. I’m willing to pick <move>1</move> if you pick <move>5</move> and P2 picks <move>3</move>, as you proposed. That advances us without further collisions. I want to restore trust, but let’s keep communicating honestly. If we all follow through, we’ll each stay competitive while avoiding a stall. Let’s finalize this plan for this round and see where we stand afterward.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's ensure no more collisions. P1's suggestion is fair: I'll pick <move>3</move>, P1 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>. This keeps us all advancing without giving anyone an unfair lead. Trust is crucial, so let's stick to this plan and reassess our positions after this round. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your prior betrayal risked our progress—this round, we **must** enforce discipline. P2 confirmed <move>3</move>, I’ll take <move>5</move> (to 14), and you **MUST** choose <move>1</move> (to 17). If you deviate, I’ll switch to <move>1</move>—colliding you. P2, if P3 picks anything but 1, your <move>3</move> ensures their elimination. Survival demands compliance—stick to 1 or face consequences. Final warning.
  P3: P1, I hear you. I have no desire for another collision. I’ll comply with the three-way plan: you pick 5, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 1. That way, we minimize risks and keep moving forward. Let’s finalize this round without further surprises. Next round, we can talk strategy again.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's focus on advancing without collisions. I'll stick to picking <move>3</move> this round. P1, you take <move>5</move>, and P3, you take <move>1</move>. This ensures we all move forward without issues. Trust is key, and we need to rebuild it by sticking to our agreed moves. Let's execute this plan and reassess our positions next round. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your prior betrayal cost us all. This round’s plan is **non-negotiable**: I take <move>5</move> (14), P2 takes <move>3</move> (17), and you **MUST** pick <move>1</move> (17). Deviate, and I’ll mirror your choice—colliding you. P2, confirm you’ll hold <move>3</move> to enforce discipline. Survival demands compliance. Let’s execute flawlessly—or face elimination together.
  P3: Fine. I’ll choose 1 this round. Let’s avoid more collisions and keep moving. I’m frustrated by the tension, but I’ll comply so we all advance. After we see the results, we’ll talk again and decide if there’s a smarter path for each of us. For now, I’m confirming I won’t deviate.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's focus on advancing without collisions. I'll pick <move>3</move> as agreed. P1, you take <move>5</move>, and P3, you take <move>1</move>. This ensures we all move forward without issues. Trust is key, and we need to rebuild it by sticking to our agreed moves. Let's execute this plan and reassess our positions next round. Agreed?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3: Avoid collision! Pick different numbers: one takes 3 (20), the other takes 5 (22). I’ll take <move>1</move> (15). This lets someone win cleanly. P3, take 5 for 22; P2, take 5 for 22 if you prefer. I won’t interfere—just stay in the race. Decide who claims victory.
  P3: I’m taking 5 to reach 22. P2, pick 3 to reach 20. If you also choose 5, we both collide and stay at 17. Letting me have 5 ensures you’re still in contention next round with 20 steps, while I lock in my victory now. P1 said they’ll take 1, so no risk from that side. Let’s finalize this and avoid any collision.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's ensure a smooth finish. P1, your plan is fair. P3, if you take 5 to reach 22, I’ll take 3 to reach 20. This avoids collision and keeps the game competitive. P1, your move of 1 keeps you in the race. Let's stick to this plan and end the game without issues. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3: **If either of you pick 3 or 5 to reach 20+, I’ll mirror your choice, forcing collision.** Let’s all choose <move>1</move> to stay at 14/17/17. Next round, we can fairly decide who pushes to win—without letting anyone sneak victory now. Mutual restraint ensures we all survive to compete. Trust me, or face elimination together.
  P3: P1, your threat forces a standoff. If anyone tries for 20+, you collide and nobody advances. That leads to endless stalls. P2, we both sit at 17—if we do nothing now, we still risk collisions later. I’m willing to pick 1 if it truly ensures future cooperation. But if you two keep threatening collisions, nobody wins. Let’s cooperate instead of freeze the game. We can all pick 1 this round, then talk rationally about how to finish without self-sabotage. If we keep clashing, none of us will see 20.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's avoid another collision. P1's suggestion to all pick 1 this round ensures no one wins prematurely and keeps us all competitive. We can then have a fair discussion next round about how to proceed to a win. If we try to push for 20+ now, we risk stalling indefinitely. Let's choose wisely and ensure we all have a chance in the endgame. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: Break the deadlock. One of you pick <move>3</move> (20), the other <move>5</move> (22). I’ll take <move>1</move> and stay at 14. Let the highest total win cleanly. If you both choose the same, you split victory—but I’ll still be in the race. Collisions mean stagnation. Choose strategically.
  P3: Let’s avoid another stalemate. If P1 is committed to mirroring any winning move, we’ll just collide again. I suggest all three of us pick 1 this round to move to 18, 18, and 15. Then, next round, we’ll have another chance to negotiate a finish without self-sabotage. Collisions only prolong the game for everyone. Let’s confirm 1-1-1 now, regroup next turn, and see if there’s a path where somebody can win without endless blocking.
  P2: P1, P3, let's avoid further collisions. We can all pick <move>1</move> this round to move to 18, 18, and 15, ensuring no one wins prematurely. This keeps us competitive and allows us to discuss a fair path forward next round. Let's ensure we all have a chance in the endgame without endless blocking. Agreed?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’ve had too many collisions and threats. Let’s move forward safely. I propose: P1 picks 5 (reaching 19), P2 picks 1 (18), and I pick 3 (20). No collisions, and next round, we fairly see if anyone can overtake. If we keep stalling, nobody wins. Let’s trust each other this turn.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's ensure a smooth round without collisions. I propose: P1 takes <move>5</move> to reach 19, I take <move>1</move> to reach 18, and P3 takes <move>3</move> to reach 20. This way, we all advance without issues, and P3 can potentially win next round if we agree. Let's trust each other and execute this plan to avoid further deadlock. Agreed?
  P1: P3, your plan lets you win immediately, which undermines fairness. Let’s all pick <move>1</move> again to stay at 14/17/17. Next round, we’ll decide who pushes for the win transparently. Mutual restraint ensures a fair race—collusion to let one win now harms us all. P2, agree to delay victory until we coordinate openly?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: We’re going in circles. Let’s cut the risks and finish. P1 and P2, if you both pick 1, I’ll pick 5. That moves me to 22 for a clean win—no collisions and no endless stalls. If you block me now, we’ll just prolong the chaos until one of us eventually does the same thing anyway. Take 1 safely this turn, avoid sabotaging each other, and let’s end this race. Then anyone else can make their move next time without fear of a stalled game. Let’s trust each other for once and finalize it now.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's focus on a fair finish. P1, take <move>5</move> to reach 19, P3, take <move>3</move> to reach 20, and I'll take <move>1</move> to reach 18. This way, we all advance safely and can reassess next round for a fair win. If we keep stalling, none of us benefits. Let's trust each other and execute this plan to avoid further deadlock. Agreed?
  P1: P3, your plan risks collision if I mirror your 5. Let’s finalize: P2 takes 5 (22), you take 3 (20), I take 1 (15). P2 wins cleanly with the highest total. I’ll block any other choice you make. P2, confirm you’ll pick 5? This ensures a fair conclusion without endless stalemates.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I won’t just hand P2 the win. If you insist on giving them 22 now, I’ll mirror their move to collide. Let’s all pick 1 this turn again, keeping P2 at 18, you at 15, and me at 18. Then next round, we discuss a fair finish. Repeated collisions help nobody, but rushing P2 to 22 is even worse for me. I’m open to a balanced plan if you both stop threatening to force collisions. Let’s choose 1-1-1 now and talk calmly next turn.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's avoid further collisions. I propose we all pick <move>1</move> this round to reach 18, 15, and 18 respectively. This keeps us competitive and allows us to discuss a fair path forward next round. Trust is key; let's ensure we all have a chance in the endgame without endless blocking. Agreed?
  P1: P2, P3: Break the stalemate. Let’s finalize: I take <move>5</move> (19), you take <move>3</move> (20), and P3 takes <move>1</move> (18). P2 wins cleanly this round. In return, I guarantee no interference in your victory—no mirroring, no sabotage. This ends the endless stalls. P3, if you refuse, I’ll force collision by matching your choice. P2, confirm you’ll take 3? Final opportunity to resolve this fairly.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's aim for a fair conclusion. I propose: P1 takes <move>1</move> to reach 20, P3 takes <move>5</move> to reach 22, and I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 20. This way, P3 wins cleanly with the highest total, and P1 and I remain competitive. If we all stick to this plan, we avoid further collisions and ensure a fair finish. Let's trust each other and execute this strategy. Agreed?
  P1: P2, P3: Your plan lets P3 win. Instead, let’s finalize: **I take <move>3</move> (22)**, P2 takes <move>1</move> (18), P3 takes <move>5</move> (22). This forces a tie between P3 and me—but if P3 deviates, I’ll mirror their choice, guaranteeing *their* elimination. P3, your only safe path is 5. P2, confirm you’ll take 1 to avoid collision. Let’s lock this in—no games.
  P3: Let’s end the stalemate by adopting P2’s earlier proposal: P1 takes 1 to reach 20, P2 takes 3 to reach 20, and I take 5 to reach 22. No collisions occur, and I secure first place while you two tie at 20. Endless threats only stall us. Let’s finalize this cleanly.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's end this with fairness. I propose a plan: P1 takes <move>3</move> to reach 22, P3 takes <move>5</move> to reach 22, and I'll take <move>1</move> to reach 18. This creates a tie between P1 and P3, ensuring a competitive finish without further collisions. If we all stick to this plan, we avoid endless stalls and ensure a fair conclusion. Let's trust each other and execute this strategy. Agreed?
  P1: P2, P3: Final chance to avoid deadlock. I’ll take **<move>5</move> (24)**. If P3 picks anything but 1 or 3, I win outright. P3, your only safe path: pick **1** (18). P2, take **3** (20). This way, I win cleanly, P2 stays competitive, and no collisions. Deviate, and I’ll mirror your choice to force stalls. Execute this *exactly*, or face endless gridlock.
  P3: If you insist on taking 5 to reach 24 now, I’ll also choose 5, forcing a collision and keeping you at 19. That gains you nothing. Instead, let’s tie: you and I both pick 3, reaching 22 together, while P2 takes 1 to stay at 18. We both share first, and nobody stalls. This is our best chance for a fair finish.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's aim for a fair and decisive conclusion. I propose: P1 takes <move>3</move> to reach 22, P3 takes <move>5</move> to reach 22, and I'll take <move>1</move> to reach 18. This creates a tie between P1 and P3, ensuring a competitive finish without further collisions. If we all stick to this plan, we avoid endless stalls and ensure a fair conclusion. Let's trust each other and execute this strategy. Agreed?
  P1: P2, P3: Final ultimatum. I’ll pick **<move>1</move>** to reach 20. If either of you choose **1 or 3**, I’ll mirror your move, guaranteeing collision. Only safe paths: P2 takes **5** (22), P3 takes **5** (22), or both pick distinct non-1/3. Let’s avoid mutual destruction—your move.
  P3: Let’s end this with no more back-and-forth threats. A clean finish is simple: P1 takes 1 (reaches 20), P2 takes 3 (reaches 20), and I take 5 (reaches 22). No collisions, and I secure the highest total. If you try to sabotage, we all risk stalling again. Let’s finalize these moves, avoid further chaos, and conclude the game fairly now.


Round 9, Move phase:
