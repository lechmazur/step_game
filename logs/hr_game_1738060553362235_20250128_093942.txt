Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hello P1 and P2, let's try to pick different numbers this round to guarantee we all move. How about P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5? What do you think?
  P1: I like P3's suggestion for us to pick different numbers. If we all choose different moves, we can all advance. I’m fine with picking 1 as long as P2 and P3 stick to their choices. What do you both think? Let's work together to ensure we all move forward this round!
  P2: I agree with P3 and P1. I'll choose 3 this round to ensure we all advance smoothly.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, sounds like we have a plan for this round. I will pick 5. Let's all make our moves!
  P1: I appreciate the agreement we've reached. Just to confirm, I will be picking 1, P2 is picking 3, and P3 is picking 5. This way, we'll all advance without any collisions. Let's stick to the plan and make sure we all move forward! Looking forward to seeing our progress. If everyone is set, we can wrap up this conversation phase.
  P2: Sounds good to me. Let's all stick to our chosen numbers to ensure we all advance this round. Looking forward to our progress!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Sounds good and
  P1: I appreciate the enthusiasm, everyone! Just to clarify, I’ll definitely stick to picking 1 as we agreed. Let’s make sure we all follow through on our choices. I’m excited to see us all move forward this round! If everyone is ready, we can wrap this up and move on to the next phase. Looking forward to our progress!
  P2: P2: To maximize my chances, I’ll choose 5 this round instead of 3. Let’s see how it plays out!


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, you said you'd pick 3 earlier, but now you're saying 5. If we both pick 5, neither of us will move.  Are you sure you want to pick 5?  Picking 3 would let us all move as originally planned.
  P1: P3, I understand your concern. P2, if you choose 5, it will create a collision between you and P3, and neither of you will advance. I suggest you stick to the original plan of picking 3 so we can all move forward together. If we want to ensure progress, let's stick to our initial agreement. I will still pick 1 as we discussed. Let's make sure we all follow through on our choices! If everyone is ready, we can wrap this up and move on to the next phase.
  P2: Apologies for the earlier change. I'll stick to picking 3 as we originally agreed. Let's ensure we all advance this round together. Looking forward to making progress!

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, last round didn't go as planned. How about this round we try a different combination to ensure we all move? P1, how about you pick 5, P2 pick 1, and I pick 3? This way we can all make progress. What do you think?
  P2: P2: To maximize our progress, I'll choose 5 this round. P1 and P3, could you pick 1 and 3 respectively to avoid any collisions? Let’s ensure we all advance smoothly. What do you think?
  P1: I appreciate the suggestions, P2 and P3. However, I want to clarify my position. If I pick 5, and you both pick 1 and 3, I can advance, but it leaves you both vulnerable to collisions in future rounds. I suggest we pick numbers that allow us to advance while considering future turns. Let's aim for a combination that maximizes our chances of moving forward without blocking each other. I’m open to suggestions! If we can agree on a strategy that benefits us all, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1, P2, let's consider P2's suggestion of P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I pick 3. This way we all move forward this round and make progress. What do you think of this plan?

  P1: I appreciate the consensus we’ve reached. Just to confirm, I will pick 1, P2 will pick 5, and P3 will pick 3. This way, we can all advance without collisions. However, I encourage everyone to stay flexible in future rounds to maximize our chances of moving forward. If everyone is ready, we can wrap this up and move on to the next phase. Let's make this round a success!

  P1: I appreciate the agreement we've reached for this round. Just to confirm, I’ll be picking 1, P2 will pick 5, and P3 will pick 3. This way, we can all advance without any collisions. It's important that we stick to our choices this time to ensure we all move forward. Looking forward to seeing our progress! If everyone is ready, we can wrap this up and move on to the move phase. Let's make it a successful round!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, it sounds like we are all agreed on the plan for this round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I pick 3. Let's lock in these choices and move to the move phase to make sure we all advance.
  P2: Confirmed, I’ll pick 5 this round as agreed. Let’s move to the move phase and make progress!

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: It seems our plans haven’t worked out as intended in the last two rounds. To ensure progress this time, I suggest we try to coordinate better. I propose I pick 1 again, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and all advance. What do you both think? Let's make this round successful by sticking to our choices! If we can agree, we can move forward confidently. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
  P2: I understand your proposal, P1. To maximize my chances, I'll choose 5 this round. Let’s hope P3 selects a different number so we can all make progress. Looking forward to seeing the results!
  P3: Okay P1, since P2 seems set on picking 5, how about you pick 1 and I pick 3?  That way at least two of us can make progress this round. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I see we’re in a tricky situation this round. If P2 picks 5 and P3 picks 3, I suggest I pick 1 to ensure at least one of us moves forward. However, if P2 could consider picking 1 instead, we could guarantee that both P3 and I advance. Let's aim for a strategy that maximizes our chances of progress. What do you both think? If we can agree, we can move forward confidently!
  P2: I understand everyone's concerns. To ensure I can make progress, I'll stick with 5 this round. P1, please pick 1 and P3, please pick 3. This way, we can all advance smoothly without any collisions. Let’s move forward together and make this round successful!
  P3: Okay P2, if you are set on 5, then P1 and I can pick 1 and 3 as you suggested. P1, does picking 1 work for you this round? If P2 truly picks 5, then picking 1 and 3 will guarantee progress for both of us. Let's aim for that if P2 is firm on 5.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate your input. To maximize our chances this round, I will pick 1 as we discussed, and I hope P3 will stick with 3. P2, since you're set on 5, let's ensure we follow through on our choices to avoid collisions. If we can stick to this plan, we can all make progress this time. Let's make this round a success and move forward! If everyone is ready, we can wrap this up and move to the move phase. Looking forward to seeing our results!
  P2: I’ll stick with picking 5 this round. P1, please pick 1, and P3, please pick 3 to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let’s make this round successful!
  P3: Okay P2, if you are truly set on 5, then I will also pick 5 this round. Let's see if you are honest about your choice. P1, please pick 1 as we discussed. If P2 is not picking 5, then at least P1 and I will move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate your commitment to the plan. Just to confirm, I will pick 1 this round. P2, since you are sticking with 5, I hope you and P3 can follow through on your choices to ensure we all advance. Let's make this round successful by sticking to our agreed numbers! If we can all commit, we can wrap this up and move to the move phase. Looking forward to seeing our results!
  P2: To ensure I can advance this round, I'll pick 1. Let’s proceed with our moves and make progress!
  P3: P1, given P2's changes and unreliable statements, I don't trust P2's claim to pick 1. How about you pick 3 and I pick 5? This way, we have a better chance of both moving forward regardless of what P2 actually does.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi P1 and P3, to ensure we all make progress this round, I’ll pick 5. P1, could you choose 1, and P3 select 3? This way, we avoid collisions and everyone can advance. Let’s work together to move forward smoothly! What do you think?
  P3: Okay P1, P2, given how the last rounds went, I'm not sure P2 is being truthful. To try something different, how about P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I pick 5 this round? This way, we can test if P2 is really aiming for everyone to move or has other plans. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate your suggestions. However, I feel it's crucial to stick to a strategy that ensures we all advance. I propose I pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and maximize our chances of moving forward together. If we can agree on this plan, we can wrap up the conversation phase and proceed confidently. What do you both think? Let's make this round a success!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll choose 5 this round to make significant progress. P1 and P3, please pick different numbers to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let's work together to reach our goals!
  P3: Okay P1, given P2 is likely to pick 5 again, and has been unreliable, let's try to ensure at least P1 and I make progress. How about you pick 1 and I pick 3? This way, if P2 picks 5 as stated, we will both move. What do you think?
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate your input. To maximize our chances of advancing this round, I suggest I stick with picking 1, P2 continues with 5, and P3 picks 3. This way, if we all follow through on our choices, we can avoid collisions and ensure at least two of us move forward. Let's commit to this plan and make this round successful! What do you both think? If we can agree on this, we can wrap up the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase.
