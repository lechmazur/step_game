P1, your 3 is consistent, but if P3 picks 5 again, we risk repeating last round's zero points. \n\nP3, your suggestion of P2 taking 3 is interesting, but risky for me. How about this: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 3? This way, P3 and I avoid 5, and we minimize collision risk. \n\nLet's ensure progress without setbacks. Thoughts?"}
