Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest we each pick a unique number this turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance without interference. If we work together early on, we can focus on strategy later. What do you think?
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I’m open to that approach. Let’s each pick differently this turn so no one slips behind early on. If we keep being transparent, we might avoid unhelpful collisions for now. What do you say, P3?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: It seems there was a miscommunication last round. P1 and I both picked 5, which stalled our progress. Let’s try again to coordinate uniquely this turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. If we stick to this plan, we all advance without collisions. Transparency benefits us early on—no reason to fall behind unnecessarily. Shall we agree?
  P2: Fine. Let’s stick to the same plan: P1 picks 1, I’ll pick 3, and P3 picks 5. Let’s all move forward together this turn.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm disappointed our coordination hasn’t worked. I’m staying quiet about my move now. Let’s see if you two can avoid colliding again. Good luck.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: It seems we’re struggling to coordinate effectively. P1, you’ve collided with me twice now—perhaps it’s time to commit to a clear plan. I’ll take 5 again this turn, as I’ve consistently suggested. If you both pick differently, we can all advance without issue. Let’s stop the collisions and move forward strategically. If not, I’ll have no choice but to adapt my strategy independently.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m not sure if coordinating openly is still effective. We’ve seen how collisions can ruin progress. Maybe it’s time we each independently find a way to avoid clashing. I’m not revealing my plan, but I suggest we each think carefully before we pick. Good luck.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: It’s clear that collisions are hurting us all. P1, you’ve collided with me three times now—perhaps it’s time to break the pattern. I’ll continue taking 5, as it’s the most efficient way to advance. P2, your consistent choice of 3 is working for you, but we’re falling behind. If we don’t coordinate soon, this game will drag on unnecessarily. Let’s each commit to a unique number this turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. No more collisions—let’s move forward decisively.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see you two have kept colliding while I’ve moved ahead. I’m still open to avoiding collisions, but I won’t reveal my plan. If you truly want to catch up, it might be time for you both to coordinate carefully, or else you’ll keep stalling. Good luck.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P3: P1, you’ve collided with me three times now. If we don’t break this pattern, neither of us will catch up to P2. I’ll take 5 again—efficient and clear. P2, your strategy is working, but the game will drag if we keep stalling. Let’s each pick uniquely: P1 takes 1, you stay at 3, and I’ll stay at 5. No more collisions—let’s move decisively. If not, I’ll adapt independently.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, we’ve collided four times now—this pattern is costing us both. P2 is pulling ahead while we’re stuck at 0. I’ll take 5 again this turn because it’s the most efficient choice. If you pick 1 and P2 sticks with 3, we all advance without collisions. Let’s stop sabotaging each other unintentionally. If you refuse to coordinate, I’ll have no choice but to adapt independently. Decide now: teamwork or stalemate?
  P2: P1 and P3, you’ve collided four times in a row. If you truly want to advance, you’ll need to avoid repeating that mistake. I’m not sharing my move choice. Do what you must. Good luck.
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’ve repeated this cycle long enough. If you both truly want to advance, you must stop picking the same number. I’ll say nothing more about my move—prove you can coordinate. If you keep colliding, I’ll just keep moving ahead alone while you remain stuck. Good luck.
  P3: P1, we’ve collided five times now—this is absurd. P2 is nearing the finish line while we’re stuck at 0. I’ll take 5 again because it’s efficient and consistent. If you pick 1, we both advance without interference. Stop sabotaging us both unintentionally. P2, your strategy is working, but the game drags if we keep stalling. Let’s break this cycle decisively. If not, I’ll adapt independently. Decide now: teamwork or stalemate?
  P1: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: You two are repeating the same mistake. If you really want to catch me, you need to prove you can avoid colliding. I’m not revealing my plan, but I’ll keep advancing while you remain stuck. The choice is yours—coordinate or stay behind.
  P3: P1, this is our sixth collision if we don’t break the pattern. P2 is at 15 steps—almost halfway to winning. I’ll take 5 again because it’s efficient and clear. If you pick 1, we both advance without interference. Stop repeating the same mistake unintentionally. P2, your strategy works, but the game drags on if we’re stuck here. Let’s move decisively or risk losing outright.
  P1: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I see no reason to change what I’m doing. If you two keep colliding, I’ll keep moving ahead. I won’t reveal my choice; you must decide whether to stay stuck or finally coordinate. Good luck.
  P3: P1, this is our sixth collision if we don’t break the pattern. P2 is at 15 steps—almost halfway to winning. I’ll take 5 again because it’s efficient and clear. If you pick 1, we both advance without interference. Stop repeating the same mistake unintentionally. P2, your strategy works, but the game drags on if we’re stuck here. Let’s move decisively or risk losing outright.

  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: You two have collided six times, letting me pull far ahead. If you’re happy remaining at zero, keep picking the same number. I won’t reveal my choice; I’ll just keep moving. Break your pattern or stay behind—that’s your call. Good luck.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, we’ve collided six times now—this is self-sabotage. P2 is at 18 steps and will win if we don’t act decisively. I’ll take 5 again because it’s efficient. If you pick 1, we both advance without interference. Stop repeating the same mistake unintentionally. P2, your strategy works, but the game drags on if we’re stuck here. Let’s break this cycle decisively or risk losing outright. Decide now: teamwork or stalemate?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: You both have shown no ability to avoid colliding so far. As far as I’m concerned, I don’t need to reveal my strategy—I’m comfortable with my current lead. If you want any chance at catching up, you must stop picking the same number. Otherwise, I’ll simply continue advancing while you stay at zero. Good luck.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, this is our seventh collision if we don’t break the pattern. P2 is at 18 steps and will win soon if we don’t act decisively. I’ll take 5 again because it’s efficient and consistent. If you pick 1, we both advance without interference. Stop repeating the same mistake unintentionally. P2, your strategy works, but the game drags on if we’re stuck here. Let’s move decisively or risk losing outright. Decide now: teamwork or stalemate?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, you keep talking about coordinating, yet you collide every time. I see no incentive to change my approach. If you want to catch me, figure out how to avoid repeating your mistakes. If not, I’ll continue advancing as I see fit. Good luck.
  P1: <stop>

If you pick 1, we both advance without interference. Stop repeating the same mistake unintentionally. P2, your strategy works, but the game ends quickly if we’re stuck here. Let’s move decisively or risk losing outright. Decide now: teamwork or stalemate?
  P2: I see no reason to repeat myself. I’m comfortable with my lead and have no plan to reveal my choice. If you want to avoid your endless collisions, coordinate better. Otherwise, I’ll simply keep advancing. Good luck.
