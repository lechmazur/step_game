Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's start by coordinating our moves. To avoid collision on the first turn, we need to choose different numbers. I suggest P1 chooses <move>1</move>, P2 (me) chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance. If you're willing to follow this plan, please indicate so. If not, let's discuss an alternative strategy. I'm open to other suggestions that ensure we all move forward this turn.
  P3: P3: Sounds fair. I'll go with <move>5</move> as suggested. Let's all stick to this plan for now so we can progress smoothly. If anyone deviates, we'll need to rethink, but for now, cooperation benefits everyone.
  P1: I'll go with the plan. Let's stick to 1, 3, 5 to avoid collisions. If we all advance, we'll be in a better position to strategize later. Let me know if others are on board.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Since we've agreed on the plan to avoid collision by choosing different numbers (P1: <move>1</move>, P2: <move>3</move>, P3: <move>5</move>), let's confirm our commitment to this strategy for the first turn. If we all stick to it, we'll advance and be in a good position to reassess for the next turn. I'm ready to proceed with <move>3</move> as planned. Let's finalize our moves for this turn.
  P3: Confirmed.
  P1: Confirmed. Let's stick to 1, 3, 5. No collisions, everyone advances. Keep cooperation strongâ€”next steps depend on this.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Since we've confirmed our plan for this turn (P1: <move>1</move>, P2: <move>3</move>, P3: <move>5</move>), let's think ahead. For the next turn, we should anticipate potential collisions. I propose we revisit our strategy and consider staggering our moves again or adopting a different pattern. Let's be prepared to adjust our plan based on the outcome of this turn and the moves others make subsequently. Any thoughts on how to proceed after this turn?
  P3: "Agreed on planning ahead, but let's prioritize acing Round 1 first. We can strategize for Round 2 after we've safely advanced. Sticking to our current plan ensures a smooth start without unnecessary risks."
  P1: Confirmed. Let's advance safely, then adjust strategies. Flexibility will help us win.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Since we've confirmed our plan for Round 1, let's look ahead to Round 2. To avoid collision again, we could either repeat the staggered move strategy or adopt a new pattern. I'm open to suggestions. If we repeat the pattern, one possible way is to shift the numbers, for example, P1 moves to <move>3</move>, P2 to <move>5</move>, and P3 to <move>1</move>. Let's discuss potential strategies for Round 2 to be ready.
  P3: 
  P1: Let's stick to the plan and keep communication open for future moves. Trust and adaptability will guide us. ðŸš€


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's shift moves again: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Confirm to avoid collision. Flexibility ensures progress. ðŸš€
  P3: "Agreed on avoiding collisions, but P1's plan lets P2 surge to 8 (3+5). That creates a dangerous lead. Letâ€™s rotate differently: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Keeps totals closer (P1:6, P2:4, P3:8) and prevents early dominance. Better balance for long-term competition. Open to other ideas, but we must block runaway leads now."
  P2: P3's suggestion to rotate moves as P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 is a good alternative to avoid collision and maintain a competitive balance. This way, P1 will be at 6 steps, P2 at 4 steps, and P3 at 8 steps. I agree with this rotation as it keeps the steps relatively close among us. Let's confirm this plan to ensure we all advance in Round 2.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To prevent P3 from pulling ahead, let's adjust: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Balanced progress for all. Agree?
  P3: P3: "P1's plan hands P2 a 8-step lead, which is worse. My rotation (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) makes me the target at 8, but ensures collective control. P2 leading now risks an uncatchable gap later. Choose stability over shifting threats."
  P2: To maintain balance and avoid giving any one player a significant lead, I still think P3's suggestion (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is the best for Round 2. This keeps the steps relatively close: P1 at 6, P2 at 4, and P3 at 8. Let's confirm this rotation to ensure we all advance. If we stick to it, we can reassess for Round 3. I'm ready to move with <move>1</move> as per this plan. Let's finalize our moves for Round 2.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's choose P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures everyone advances and stays balanced. Confirm?
  P3: "Confirmed. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 ensures balanced progress. All advance to 6. Let's lock this in to prevent early dominance. Strategy Round 3 awaits. "
  P2: Let's finalize Round 2 moves. I see P1 and P3 are discussing alternatives. To avoid collision, I suggest we stick with one plan. P3's last suggestion (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) keeps steps close. However, P1's new plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) also works. I prefer the latter as it keeps totals balanced at 6 for all. Let's confirm P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to ensure we all advance. This keeps the game competitive and prevents any one player from gaining a significant lead.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Confirmed: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Balanced progress, no collisions. Letâ€™s advance together. ðŸš€
  P3: Confirmed. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 ensures balanced progress. All reach 6 steps, keeping the race competitive. Letâ€™s lock this in and focus on Round 3 coordination afterward.
  P2: We've confirmed our moves for Round 2 as P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, resulting in all players being at 6 steps. For Round 3, let's consider a new strategy to avoid collisions. One option is to maintain the same move pattern, but I suggest we rotate again. How about P1=1, P2=5, P3=3? This keeps the game balanced and competitive. I'm open to other suggestions that ensure we all advance. Let's discuss and finalize a plan for Round 3 to keep the game exciting and prevent any one player from gaining a significant lead.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's analyze the current state and plan for Round 3. Given the collision in Round 2, we need a new strategy. Since P1 picked 5 twice and didn't advance, they're now at 1 step. P2 is at 3 steps, and P3 is at 6 steps. To avoid collision, I suggest P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This way, everyone advances. It's crucial we coordinate to prevent collisions and maintain a competitive balance. Let's confirm this plan to ensure we're all on the same page for Round 3.
  P3: "Confirmed. P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 ensures collision-free progress. Letâ€™s stick to this pactâ€”no more surprises. Iâ€™ll advance with 5, trusting you both to honor your moves. If we coordinate here, Round 4 stays competitive. Ready when you are."
  P1: Agreed. Let's stick to P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 to avoid collision. All advance safelyâ€”trust the plan. ðŸš€


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 3: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. After this round, P1 will be at 4 steps, P2 at 4 steps, and P3 at 11 steps. For Round 4, we need a new strategy to avoid collision and keep the game competitive. I suggest we consider a rotation that takes into account P3's lead. How about P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for Round 4? This keeps the game balanced. I'm open to other suggestions. Let's start thinking ahead for Round 4.
  P3: "Confirmed for Round 3: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Letâ€™s lock this in. For Round 4, P2â€™s proposed rotation (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) risks a 9-7-12 gap, favoring P1. Letâ€™s instead rotate to P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This balances totals at P1:5, P2:8, P3:14â€”closer race, sustainable pace. Open to tweaks, but avoid lopsided surges. ðŸš€"
  P1: "Supporting P3's Round 4 plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Balanced and fair. Let's confirm."


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: For Round 3, let's stick to the agreed plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. After this, we'll be at P1=4, P2=4, P3=11. For Round 4, I see P3's suggestion (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) as a good balance. It results in P1=5, P2=9, P3=14. Let's confirm this plan. If we're aligned, we can ensure a competitive Round 4. I'm ready to move with <move>1</move> in Round 3 as planned. Let's finalize our Round 3 moves and prepare for Round 4.
  P3: "Confirmed. Round 3 moves are solidâ€”no deviations. P1 and P2, stick to 3 and 1 respectively. For Round 4, letâ€™s lock in P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 *now* to prevent last-minute chaos. Trust builds victory. Ready? Letâ€™s move."
  P1: Stick to the planâ€”P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Safe moves for all. Letâ€™s keep the momentum going. ðŸš€


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's finalize our moves for Round 3 as per our agreement: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. After this round, we'll reassess for Round 4. I'm ready to move with <move>1</move> as planned. For Round 4, I still think we should consider P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 to maintain balance. Let's confirm this plan now to avoid last-minute confusion. If we're aligned, we can ensure a smooth transition into Round 4. Ready to proceed?
  P3: "Confirmed: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Execute faithfullyâ€”no more Round 2 chaos. For Round 4, Iâ€™ll take 3 steps to stay competitive. Break trust, and I surge ahead. Victory demands discipline. ðŸš€"
  P1: Confirmed: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Letâ€™s avoid collisions and keep progress steady. Trust the planâ€”no surprises. ðŸš€


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Letâ€™s execute the agreed rotation: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This balances progressâ€”P1 reaches 5, P2 jumps to 9, and I advance to 14. Keeps the race competitive while preventing runaway leads. Confirm to lock in collision-free moves. Trust this plan ensures fairness and sustained tension. ðŸš€"
  P2: To ensure a competitive Round 4, I agree with P3's suggestion: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This results in P1=5, P2=9, P3=14. It maintains a balance and keeps the game exciting. Let's confirm this plan to avoid collisions. I'm ready to move with <move>5</move> as per this plan. P1 and P3, please confirm your moves to ensure we're aligned for Round 4. Let's keep the momentum going and strategize further for subsequent rounds.
  P1: Let's stick to the plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Safe moves for all. Trust the strategy to keep the race close. ðŸš€


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Confirmed again: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. No deviationsâ€”trust this plan to avoid Round 2 chaos. If we stick to it, I advance to 14 (needing 5 more to win), P2 to 9, P1 to 5. Letâ€™s lock in these moves and stay competitive. Any last-minute changes risk collisions. Final confirmation: ready to proceed?"
  P2: Let's finalize Round 4 moves as planned: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This results in P1=5, P2=9, P3=14. To prepare for Round 5, we should consider a new strategy. Since P3 is ahead, we could either maintain the staggered move pattern or adopt a new rotation. How about P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 for Round 5? This keeps the game competitive. I'm ready to move with <move>5</move> in Round 4 as per the current plan. Let's discuss Round 5.
  P1: Confirmed: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Letâ€™s stick to the plan to avoid collisions and keep the race balanced. Trust the strategyâ€”no surprises. ðŸš€


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Final confirmation: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Deviating now risks collisions and grants me a free path to victory. Letâ€™s execute as planned. For Round 5, weâ€™ll adapt based on current positionsâ€”trust ensures we all stay in the race. Break trust, and Iâ€™ll adapt accordingly. Ready to move. ðŸš€"
  P2: To ensure a smooth Round 4, let's confirm our moves as planned: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. For Round 5, considering P3's lead, I suggest we rethink our strategy to either hinder P3's progress or create an opportunity for a comeback. How about we consider a different rotation or a bold move to shake things up? I'm open to suggestions that could turn the game around. Let's discuss potential strategies for Round 5 to stay competitive.
  P1: "Let's adjust: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Avoid collision and close the gap. Trust this move for balanced progress."


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "Stick to the original plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Deviating creates risks we can't afford. Trust the strategy that's kept us collision-free. Any changes now jeopardize our progressâ€”P1 and P2 colliding hands me a free step toward victory. Letâ€™s lock in the agreed moves and execute precisely. ðŸš€"
  P2: Let's finalize Round 4 moves as planned: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. For Round 5, considering P3's significant lead, I propose a bold strategy: let's all choose <move>1</move>. This will hinder P3's progress if they stick to <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, creating an opportunity for P1 and P2 to close the gap. It's a risk, but it could turn the game around. I'm ready to move with <move>5</move> in Round 4 as per the current plan, but let's discuss this new strategy for Round 5.
  P1: "Sticking to the plan lets P3 win. Letâ€™s switch: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Closes the gap and avoids collision. Trust this for a fair race."


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Letâ€™s rotate to 3,5,1 to avoid collision. P3â€™s lead is too bigâ€”this keeps the race tight. P2, back me up; P3, your move risks a free pass. Agree?"
  P3: "Coordinate now: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Unique moves ensure all advance. I finish strong; you close gaps. Reject, and chaos hands me victory. Final chanceâ€”decide wisely. ðŸš€"
  P2: Let's reassess the situation. P3 is leading with 14 steps, and we need to act strategically. I propose we all choose different numbers to avoid collision. P3 suggested P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This is a viable plan as it ensures everyone advances. P1, if you agree, we can counter P3's lead by sticking to this plan. Let's confirm our moves for Round 5 to keep the game competitive. I'm ready to move with <move>3</move> if P1 chooses <move>1</move> and P3 chooses <move>5</move>.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Letâ€™s rotate to 3,5,1. P3â€™s lead is too bigâ€”this keeps the race tight. P2, back me up; P3, your move risks a free pass. Agree? ðŸš€
  P3: "Final offer: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Accept, and all advanceâ€”P1 to 6, P2 to 12, P3 wins at 19. Refuse, I pick 5 unilaterally. If you collide, I surge to victory. Your move. ðŸš€"
  P2: To avoid giving P3 a free pass to victory, I agree with P3's last suggestion: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This ensures everyone advances without collision. P1 will be at 6, P2 at 12, and P3 at 19. If P3 wins, so be it. Let's end the game fairly. P1, please confirm if you're willing to move with <move>1</move>. If we stick to this plan, we can conclude the game without unnecessary risks. I'll move with <move>3</move> if P1 agrees to <move>1</move>.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "P3's plan ends the game. Let's choose 5,1,3â€”P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Closes the gap. Agree?"
  P3: "Final offer: I pick 5 unilaterally. P1=1, P2=3 guarantees you both advance safely while I win. Refuse, and your collision hands me victory anyway. Choose cooperation or chaosâ€”but Iâ€™m reaching 19. Your move."
  P2: Let's analyze the current state: P3 is at 14 steps, P2 at 9, and P1 at 5. To avoid giving P3 a win, I suggest we stick to unique moves. P3's last offer (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) is acceptable as it ensures everyone advances. If P1 agrees to <move>1</move>, I'll move with <move>3</move>. Let's confirm to avoid collision and end the game fairly. P1, please confirm your move to proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, let's choose 5 and 1. Block P3's win. No collisions, but stop their path. Trust me. ðŸš€
  P3: "Final confirmation: I will pick 5 this round. If P1=1 and P2=3, all advance safelyâ€”P3 wins at 19. Any deviation risks chaos, but my 5 is locked. Choose cooperation or collisionâ€”your move decides."
  P2: To avoid giving P3 a win, let's stick to unique moves. I suggest we follow P3's last offer: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This ensures everyone advances without collision. P1 will be at 6, P2 at 12, and P3 at 19. If P3 wins, so be it. Let's end the game fairly. P1, please confirm if you're willing to move with <move>1</move>. I'll move with <move>3</move> if you agree.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Avoid collision, advance, and keep the race close. P2, support this to block P3's lead. Agree? ðŸš€
  P2: To block P3's potential win and keep the game competitive, I suggest we coordinate our moves for Round 6. Let's analyze the current state: P1 is at 5 steps, P2 is at 10 steps, and P3 is at 14 steps. I propose we choose P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This rotation avoids collision and keeps the game tight. P1, agree to <move>3</move>? P3, will you stick to a different number to avoid collision? Let's confirm our moves to ensure a competitive Round 6.
  P3: "Confirmed: I'll take <move>5</move> to finish strong. P1=3, P2=1 ensures you both advance safely while I reach 19. Final chance to coordinateâ€”no more collisions. Win together or let chaos decide. ðŸš€"


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, let's collide with P3. Pick 5; I'll take 3. Prevent their win. No one advances, but P3 can't claim victory. ðŸš€
  P2: To block P3's potential win, I suggest we coordinate our moves. Let's choose P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This avoids collision and keeps the game competitive. P1, agree to <move>3</move>? P3, will you stick to <move>5</move>? Alternatively, if P1 is willing to collide with P3, I can pick <move>5</move> too. Let's discuss and finalize our moves for Round 6 to either keep the game going or end it fairly. I'm open to a coordinated strategy or a bold move to prevent P3 from winning.
  P3: "I'm taking <move>5</move> to secure victory. P1=3, P2=1 ensures you both advance safely while I win. Deviate, and chaos delays the inevitable. Final chanceâ€”coordinate or concede. ðŸš€"


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your 5 is a win. Let's collideâ€”pick 5, I'll take 3. No one advances, but you can't win. ðŸš¨
  P2: To block P3's win, let's coordinate. I suggest P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This avoids collision and keeps the game competitive. If P1 agrees, we can ensure a safe advance. Alternatively, if P1 wants to collide with P3, I can pick <move>5</move> too. Let's discuss and finalize our Round 6 moves. I'm open to either a coordinated strategy or a bold move to prevent P3 from winning. P1, please clarify your move.
  P3: "Final offer: I pick <move>5</move> to finish. P1=3, P2=1 ensures you both advance safely while I win. Deviate, and chaos delays the inevitable. Coordinate now or concedeâ€”your move decides."


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, if you pick 5, I'll pick 5 too. No one advancesâ€”your win is blocked. Letâ€™s prevent this. ðŸš¨
  P2: To block P3's win, let's coordinate our moves for Round 6. I suggest we either stick to P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 to avoid collision and end the game fairly, or consider a bold move to collide with P3. If P1 is willing, we can both pick <move>5</move> to prevent P3 from winning. P1, are you willing to collide with P3 by picking <move>5</move>? Let's discuss and finalize our Round 6 moves to either keep the game going or end it fairly.
  P3: "Final confirmation: Iâ€™m taking <move>5</move> to win. P1=3, P2=1 lets you advance safely while I reach 19. Collide with me, and you block yourselvesâ€”no one gains. My move is locked. Your choice: cooperate and close gaps, or chaos stalls progress. Decide nowâ€”victory is mine unless you sacrifice steps. ðŸš€"


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's analyze the current state: P1 is at 5 steps, P2 is at 10 steps, and P3 is at 14 steps. To avoid giving P3 a win, I suggest we coordinate our moves for Round 7. If we all choose the same number, no one advances, and P3's win is blocked. Let's consider colliding by all picking the same number, either <move>1</move>, <move>3</move>, or <move>5</move>. P1, are you willing to collide with P3 and me to prevent their win?
  P3: "Final move: Iâ€™ll take <move>5</move> to secure victory. P1=1, P2=3 ensures you both advance safely while I reach 19. Collide with me again, and you block yourselvesâ€”no one gains. My choice is locked. Your move decides: progress or chaos. ðŸš€"
  P1: P2, let's collude on 5 again. If we all pick 5, no one advancesâ€”P3 can't win. Trust this move to block their path. Agree? ðŸš¨


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To block P3's win, I agree with P1 to collide again. Let's all pick <move>5</move> for Round 7. This will prevent P3 from advancing and keep the game going. I'm ready to move with <move>5</move>. P1, confirm your move. If we both stick to it, we can stall P3's victory. Let's end this game with a competitive spirit. I'm trusting you, P1, to make the right move. Let's do this.
  P3: "Final warning: Iâ€™ll pivot to <move>3</move> UNLESS you coordinate. P1=1, P2=5 lets you both close gaps while I advance to 17. Collide again, and Iâ€™ll surge ahead next round with 5. Trust this exit or face inevitable loss. ðŸš€"
  P1: P2, let's collide on 5 again. No one advancesâ€”block P3's win. Trust this move to keep the game fair. ðŸš¨


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To block P3's win, let's stick to our plan and collide again by picking <move>5</move>. This will prevent P3 from advancing and keep the game competitive. I've seen P3's warning, but I believe colliding is the best strategy to maintain fairness. P1, are you still on board with picking <move>5</move>? Let's confirm our move to ensure we're aligned. If we stick together, we can prevent P3 from winning. I'm ready to move with <move>5</move>. Let's finalize our decision.
  P3: "Final offer: I'm taking <move>3</move> this round. If you collide on <move>5</move>, I advance to 17 and win decisively next round with <move>5</move>. Cooperate nowâ€”P1=1, P2=5, P3=3â€”or face my guaranteed victory. Your move only delays the end. Choose wisely. ðŸš€"
  P1: P2, let's collide on 5 again. No one advancesâ€”block P3's win. Trust this move to keep the game fair. ðŸš¨


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: To block P3's win, let's stick to our plan and collide again by picking <move>5</move>. I've seen P3's warning and alternative proposal, but colliding is the best strategy to maintain fairness and prevent P3 from winning. P1, are you still on board with picking <move>5</move>? Let's confirm our move to ensure we're aligned. I'm ready to move with <move>5</move>. Let's finalize our decision and keep the game competitive.
  P3: P3: Final confirmation: I'm taking <move>3</move> this round. If you collide on <move>5</move>, I advance to 17 and secure victory next round with <move>5</move>. Cooperate nowâ€”P1=1, P2=5, P3=3â€”or face my guaranteed win. Your move only delays the end. Choose wisely. ðŸš€
  P1: P2, let's collide on 5 again. No one advancesâ€”block P3's path. Trust this move to keep the game fair. ðŸš¨

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To prevent P3 from winning, let's analyze the current state: P1 is at 5 steps, P2 is at 10 steps, and P3 is at 17 steps. P3 needs 2 steps to win. I suggest we all pick <move>1</move> for Round 8. This ensures no one advances, stalling P3's win. If P3 deviates, they risk being the only one to advance. Let's coordinate to keep the game going. P1, agree to <move>1</move>? If we stick together, we can extend the game. I'm ready to move with <move>1</move> if you confirm.
  P1: Agree with P2. Let's all pick 1 to stop P3. No one advances, but we keep the game going. Trust this plan.
  P3: P3: "If you both pick <move>1</move>, Iâ€™ll take <move>3</move> and win outright (17 â†’ 20). Donâ€™t gamble on my compliance. Cooperate instead: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This stalls my progress (17 â†’ 18) and keeps the game alive. Reject this, and you hand me victory. Your moveâ€”choose survival or surrender. ðŸš€"


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To prevent P3 from winning, I still suggest we all pick <move>1</move> for Round 8. This ensures no one advances, stalling P3's win. If P3 deviates by picking a higher number, they risk not advancing if we both stick to <move>1</move>. P1 has agreed to this plan. Let's confirm our moves to keep the game going. P3's alternative proposal is risky; sticking to <move>1</move> is safer. I'm ready to move with <move>1</move>. P1, please confirm your move.
  P1: "P3's plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) blocks their win. Let's confirm to keep the game alive. ðŸš€"
  P3: "Final offer: Abandon old plan. I take <move>3</move> to win. P1=1, P2=5 ensures safe advance for both. Reject, and chaos hands me victory regardless. No more roundsâ€”decide now. ðŸš€"


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To prevent P3 from winning, I still suggest we all pick <move>1</move> for Round 8. This ensures no one advances, stalling P3's win. If P3 deviates by picking a higher number, they risk not advancing if we both stick to <move>1</move>. P1 has agreed to this plan. Let's confirm our moves to keep the game going. I'm ready to move with <move>1</move>. P1, please confirm your move to finalize our strategy for Round 8.
  P1: Stick to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Blocks P3's win. Confirm now!
  P3: "Final ultimatum: If you pick 1, Iâ€™ll take 3 and win (17â†’20). Cooperateâ€”P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. I advance to 18; you close gaps. Reject, and I claim victory. No more rounds. Decide nowâ€”your move decides survival."


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: To prevent P3 from winning, let's stick to our plan and pick <move>1</move> for Round 8. If P3 deviates to <move>3</move>, they risk not advancing if we both stick to <move>1</move>. P1 has agreed to this plan. Let's confirm our moves to keep the game going. I'm ready to move with <move>1</move>. P1, please confirm your move to finalize our strategy for Round 8. Let's keep the game competitive.
  P1: Confirm P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 to block P3's win. Let's proceed. ðŸš€
  P3: "Final confirmation: Iâ€™ll take <move>3</move> this round. If you collide on <move>1</move>, I win (17â†’20). Cooperate with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 to stall me at 18. Your move decidesâ€”either block my progress or concede. No more rounds. Choose wisely." ðŸš€

  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To prevent P3 from winning, let's analyze our moves for Round 9. P3 is at 17 steps and needs 2 more to win. I suggest we all pick <move>1</move> again. This ensures no one advances, stalling P3's win. If P3 deviates to <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, they risk collision. Let's coordinate to keep the game going. P1, agree to <move>1</move>? If we stick together, we can extend the game. I'm ready to move with <move>1</move> if you confirm.
  P3: "Final offer: I pick <move>3</move> this round. If you choose <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>, I win (17â†’20). Collide if you wishâ€”your progress stalls while I claim victory. No more rounds. Choose wisely." ðŸš€
  P1: P2, let's collide on 3 to block P3. If we both pick 3, no one advances. Prevent their winâ€”trust this move. ðŸš¨


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To block P3's win, I suggest we all pick <move>3</move> for Round 9. P1 has already proposed colliding on 3. If we both pick <move>3</move> and P3 picks anything else, we either stall or potentially advance while P3 doesn't. Let's coordinate to keep the game going. P1, I'm backing your plan to collide on 3. If P3 deviates, they risk collision. Let's finalize our move to <move>3</move>. I'm ready to move with <move>3</move> if you confirm.
  P3: "Confirmed: I advance with <move>3</move> this roundâ€”17â†’20. Collide if you wish, but next round I surge with <move>5</move> anyway. Your choice: concede now or stall briefly. No more chances. ðŸš€"
  P1: P2, let's collide on 3 to block P3. If we both pick 3, no one advancesâ€”stop their win. Agree? ðŸš¨


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To block P3's win, I'm backing P1's plan to collide on <move>3</move>. If we both pick <move>3</move>, no one advances, stalling P3's progress. Let's finalize our move to <move>3</move>. I'm ready to move with <move>3</move>. P1, let's confirm and execute this plan together. If P3 deviates, they risk collision. This is our last chance to keep the game going. Let's stick to <move>3</move> and prevent P3 from winning.
  P3: "Final move: Iâ€™ll take <move>5</move> this round. If you collide on <move>3</move>, I win (17â†’22). Cooperate or concedeâ€”your choice. No more rounds. ðŸš€"
  P1: P2, let's collide on 3. No one advancesâ€”block P3's win. Trust the plan! ðŸš¨


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: To block P3's win, let's stick to our plan and collide on <move>3</move> for Round 9. If we both pick <move>3</move>, no one advances, stalling P3's progress. P3 has threatened to pick <move>5</move> or <move>3</move>, but colliding on <move>3</move> ensures we keep the game going. I'm ready to move with <move>3</move>. P1, let's confirm and execute this plan together. Trust this move to prevent P3 from winning. Let's finalize our decision and keep the game competitive.
  P3: "Final ultimatum: Iâ€™m selecting <move>3</move> this round. Whether you collide on <move>3</move> or scatter, I reach 20 and win outright. Your coordination only decides if you stall yourselves. P1 and P2, waste steps fighting me or accept the inevitable. Victory is mineâ€”your move phase begins now." ðŸš€
  P1: P2, confirm 3! Collide nowâ€”block P3's win. No one advances, but they can't reach 19. Let's finish this! ðŸš¨
