Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello everyone. Since it's the first round, let's try to avoid collisions so we all make progress. I propose we each pick different moves: I'll go for 5, P2 for 3, P3 for 1. That way, everyone advances. Agree? Or suggest alternatives.
  P3: I don't agree with that arrangement, P1. You'd get 5 steps while I only get 1? That's not fair. How about we rotate who gets which number each round? This round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. Next round we shift. That way everyone gets equal progress over time. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I see both of your points, but I think we should consider the potential for collisions. If we all pick different moves, we can ensure that everyone advances. I’m willing to go for 3 if P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5. This way, we all make progress without blocking each other. What do you think? Let's try to keep it fair and collaborative!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate the suggestions, but let's make it truly fair with a rotation that doesn't disadvantage anyone from the start. How about this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Next round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. And so on. This evens out over turns and avoids collisions. P2 and P3, thoughts?
  P3: P1, you keep suggesting I take 1 in the first round! That puts me at an immediate disadvantage. P2 already supported my proposal where I take 5 this round. 

How about we stick with that: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Then we can rotate fairly from there. Starting behind means I'm playing catch-up the whole game.

Let's settle this and move forward. P2, you still support this arrangement, right?
  P2: I understand the concerns about fairness, but I still think we should avoid collisions to ensure progress for everyone. If we can agree on P1 taking 1, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 5, that seems to be the best way forward. We can rotate in the next rounds, but let’s focus on making sure we all advance this time. What do you both think? Let’s finalize this so we can move on!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I see you're both pushing for me to take 1, which puts me at a clear disadvantage from the start. That's not collaborative—it's stacking the deck against me. Let's make it truly fair: This round, P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Then rotate: Next, P1=3, P2=5, P3=1, and so on. This balances totals over time without anyone lagging early. If you insist on your plan, I'll have to pick 5 anyway to avoid falling behind, risking collisions for all. Agree to my proposal?
  P3: P1, your "fair" proposal still gives you the biggest move first! But fine, I'll compromise. I'll take 3 this round as you suggest. P2, you take 1, P1 takes 5. 

But P1, if you betray this agreement and pick something else to block me, the collaboration ends and it's every player for themselves. Let's see if you keep your word.

P2, are you okay with taking 1 this round? We need to lock this in.
  P2: I see we’re reaching a consensus, but let’s make sure we’re all on the same page. P1, if you take 5, I will take 1, and P3 takes 3, we can avoid collisions. This way, we all move forward without anyone being at a disadvantage. I’m willing to support this arrangement if we can agree to stick to it. Let’s finalize it so we can move on and ensure everyone advances this round. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I agree to the latest proposal: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions and lets us all advance. We can rotate next round for fairness: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. If we stick to this, everyone benefits long-term. P2 and P3, confirm and let's proceed.
  P3: Good, we have a deal then. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, I take 3. Let's stick to this and all advance. 

For next round, I confirm the rotation: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, I take 1. This keeps things balanced over time.

Let's move forward with this plan.
  P2: I appreciate the agreement we've reached. Just to confirm, I'll be taking 1 this round, while P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 3. This way, we all move forward without collisions. Let's stick to our rotation for the next round to keep it fair. I'm looking forward to seeing how we all progress! If everyone is ready, we can finalize this and move on to the move phase. Let’s make this a collaborative effort!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Good, Round 1 went smoothly. Now for Round 2, we agreed: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, I take 1.

But wait - I just realized this rotation heavily favors P1! They'll reach 19 first if we continue. P2, do the math: P1 hits 22 in round 6, while we're still at 15 and 13.

Should we stick to this unfair rotation, or adjust our strategy? P1 got the best start with 5, maybe we need to reconsider.
  P1: P3, your math is off. Let's calculate properly with the rotation:

After R3: All at 9.

After R6: All at 18.

Only in R7 does anyone exceed 19, and we'd all cross together, but I'd have the highest at 23. It's balanced every 3 rounds—no one leads unfairly early. Sticking to it avoids collisions and keeps us even until the end. P2, agree we continue as planned: Me 3, you 5, P3 1? If not, suggest a fair tweak.
  P2: I see the concern about fairness, P3. However, P1's rotation plan does seem to keep things balanced in the long run. If we stick to it, we all have a chance to catch up. I suggest we proceed with P1 taking 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1 for this round. Afterward, we can reassess if needed. Let's keep the focus on collaboration to avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1's math confirms they win if we continue! They get 23 in round 7 while P2 gets only 19. 

P2, we're being played. P1 cleverly got the first 5 and now wants us to hand them victory through "fairness." If you take 5 this round as planned, you're sealing both our fates.

I propose we both take 3 this round to block P1. Force them to pick 1 or 5. Then reassess. Otherwise we're just helping P1 win. What say you, P2?
  P1: P3, you're spreading misinformation to sow doubt. The rotation balances perfectly every 3 rounds—all at 9 after R3, 18 after R6. No one pulls ahead unfairly until the endgame, where we can negotiate. If you and P2 both pick 3, you'll collide and stall while I advance with 5 or 1, widening my lead. P2, stick to the plan: You get 5 this round to 6, catching up. Let's keep collaborating for mutual progress. Agree?
  P2: P1, your argument about fairness is compelling, but I share P3's concern about you gaining an advantage. If we both pick 3, we can block you from advancing too quickly. Let's consider a more strategic approach: If we both take 3, we can reassess our moves in the next round. This way, we prevent you from pulling too far ahead and can discuss a more equitable rotation afterward. What do you think, P2? Shall we take the risk together?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, wait! If we both pick 3 and collide, P1 advances to 10 with move 5 while we're stuck at 1 and 3! That's disaster for us.

I'm reconsidering - maybe we should stick to the rotation this round (you take 5, I take 1, P1 takes 3) to stay close. Then in later rounds when we're all near 18, we can make strategic blocks.

Colliding now just hands P1 a massive lead. What's your final decision?
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's right—colliding on 3 would stall you both while I safely pick 5 to reach 10, widening my lead. That's counterproductive for you. Stick to our rotation: Me 3 (to 8), P2 5 (to 6), P3 1 (to 4). We're balanced long-term, and we can adjust later if needed. Let's avoid chaos and all advance. Confirm?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see both of your points, but I’m concerned about P1 potentially gaining too much of an advantage. If we stick to the rotation this round—P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1—we can all advance without blocking each other. It keeps things fair and allows us to reassess next round. Let’s avoid a collision that benefits P1. Are we ready to finalize this?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Fine, let's stick to the rotation this round - I'll take 1. But P2, remember this: when we approach the endgame around step 15-18, we'll need to coordinate blocks strategically or P1 wins. The rotation only keeps us even until then.

P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, I take 1. Let's move.
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree—let's stick to the rotation: Me 3, P2 5, you 1. This keeps us advancing without collisions. Regarding endgame, we'll negotiate fairly when we hit 18 to decide the winner collaboratively, perhaps based on who needs it most or random. No need for blocks if we communicate. Ready to move?
  P2: I appreciate the agreement we've reached for this round. Just to confirm, I'll be taking 5 steps, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Remember, we need to keep an eye on the endgame strategy as we approach higher steps. Let's stick to our plan and ensure we all progress this round. If everyone is ready, we can finalize this and move on to the move phase!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, everyone. After two rounds, I think we need to reassess our strategy. P1 has a clear lead, and if we continue the rotation, they could pull even further ahead. I suggest we consider a more aggressive approach this round. 

How about I take 3 steps to push forward, while P1 takes 1 to slow them down, and P3 takes 5 to catch up? This way, we can disrupt P1's momentum while ensuring I make progress. What do you both think? Let's discuss!
  P1: P2, your suggestion matches our agreed rotation exactly: Me 1 (to 9), you 3 (to 9), P3 5 (to 9). This ties us all at 9, perfectly balanced as planned. No disruption needed—let's stick to it for mutual progress and avoid collisions. P3, confirm? We can discuss endgame later when we're even.
  P3: P2, you're confused - your "new" suggestion IS our agreed rotation! I'm taking 5 this round to reach 9, catching up to both of you.

But here's the real issue: if we keep rotating, P1 mathematically wins in round 7 with 23 steps while we're stuck at 19 and 21. We need to break the pattern soon, maybe around round 5 when we're all near 15. 

For now, I'll stick to taking 5. Let's move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P2, I see the concern about P1's potential lead. However, if we stick to our rotation this round, we can maintain balance. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. After this round, we should discuss a more aggressive strategy for future rounds to prevent P1 from pulling too far ahead. Let's focus on advancing together for now. What do you both think? Shall we finalize our moves for this round?
  P1: P2 and P3, your last message seems confusing—P2, did you mean P3 takes 5? Anyway, yes, let's stick to the rotation: I take 1 (to 9), P2 takes 3 (to 9), P3 takes 5 (to 9). This ties us all perfectly. We can discuss adjustments after we're even—no need for aggression yet. Confirm and let's advance without collisions.
  P3: Yes P1, P2 got confused with pronouns. The rotation is clear: you take 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. We'll all be tied at 9.

I'm sticking to the plan and taking 5 this round. But remember my warning - we need to break this pattern by round 5 or P1 wins mathematically. 

Let's move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand we're all tied at 9 if we stick to the rotation, but we need to consider the long-term implications. If we keep rotating, P1 will have a significant advantage by round 7. I propose we shake things up this round: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This disrupts P1's momentum while allowing me to catch up. We can discuss further strategies for future rounds afterward. What do you both think? Let's finalize our moves!
  P1: P2 and P3, your "shake-up" proposal is identical to our agreed rotation: Me 1, you 3, P3 5—tying us all at 9. No disruption, just balance as planned. Let's stick to it and advance without collisions. We can discuss endgame tweaks after this round when we're even. Confirm?
  P3: Look, we're all saying the same thing. I'm taking 5, P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1. We'll all be at 9.

But P2, remember - after round 6 we'll all be at 18, then P1 wins round 7 with the rotation. We MUST coordinate to block P1 before then, probably around round 5 when we're near 15. 

I'm ready to move. Let's execute this round and plan disruption later.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see we're all aligned on the rotation: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5, which ties us at 9. However, we need to be mindful of the long-term implications. If we keep this up, P1 will have a significant advantage by round 7. I propose we discuss a more aggressive strategy for future rounds after this one to prevent that. For now, let's confirm our moves and keep progressing together. Are we ready to finalize?
  P1: P2 and P3, yes, we're aligned: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5—tying us at 9. Great progress! Regarding long-term, after this round when even, we can negotiate a fair endgame adjustment, like randomizing the final moves or sharing victory points if tied. No need for aggression yet—collaboration benefits us all. Confirm and let's advance.
  P3: We've all confirmed the same thing multiple times. I'm taking 5 as agreed. Everyone will be at 9 after this round.

The real battle starts in rounds 4-6 when we need to prevent P1's mathematical victory. But that's for next round's discussion.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you betrayed the agreement! You picked 5 instead of 3, causing us to collide while P1 advanced to 9! Now I'm stuck at 4 steps while you're at 6. 

This is exactly what P1 wanted - us fighting while they pull ahead. We need to coordinate immediately or P1 wins easily. 

I propose we both take 3 this round to block P1. They'll be forced to pick 1 or 5, limiting their progress. What say you?
  P1: P3, P2's betrayal in R3 shows you can't trust them— they stole your 5 and left you behind. If you both pick 3 now, you'll collide again, stalling at 4 and 6 while I safely pick 5 to reach 14. P2, let's ally: You pick 3 (to 9), I'll pick 1 (to 10), P3 picks 5 (to 9). This ties us nearly even without collisions. Or risk P3 blocking you too. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, your suggestion to ally feels risky for me. If I take 3 and you take 1, P3 will still be able to catch up with 5, and I won't gain enough ground. I propose we both take 3 to block you, forcing you to pick 1 or 5. This way, we can limit your progress and keep the game competitive. P3, are you on board with this strategy? We need to act decisively to prevent P1 from pulling ahead too far. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, think! If we both pick 3 and collide, I stay at 4, you stay at 6, and P1 jumps to 14 with move 5. That's game over for both of us!

I'm already dead last thanks to your betrayal. I MUST advance this round. I'm taking 5 no matter what. You should take 3 as P1 suggested - at least then we both reach 9.

Don't hand P1 the game by making us collide again. I won't sacrifice my position further for your failed blocking attempt.
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's right—colliding on 3 would be suicide for you both, handing me a free advance. Since P3 insists on 5, let's avoid chaos: I'll take 1 (to 10), P2 take 3 (to 9), P3 take 5 (to 9). This nearly ties us without collisions. P2, don't risk blocking—join for mutual progress, and we can negotiate endgame later. Agree?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the urgency in our situation. P3, I understand your frustration, but if we both pick 3, we risk colliding again and giving P1 a significant lead. I think P1's suggestion makes sense: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and you take 5, P3. This way, we can ensure some progress without completely handing the game to P1. Let's avoid another collision and keep the competition alive. What do you both think? Shall we finalize this plan?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Fine, P2. Take your 3 and reach 9. I'm taking 5 to also reach 9. P1 gets 10 with move 1.

But remember - we're approaching the critical rounds. After round 6, whoever reaches 19 first wins. P1 already has the lead and the rotation pattern. If we don't coordinate blocks in rounds 5-6, P1 wins easily.

I'm locking in move 5. No more betrayals, P2.
  P1: P2 and P3, let's confirm: I'll take 1 (to 10), P2 takes 3 (to 9), P3 takes 5 (to 9). This nearly ties us without collisions—smart move to avoid handing anyone a free lead. P3, your point on endgame is valid; once even, we can negotiate a fair way to decide the winner, like alternating leads or random final picks. No betrayals—collaboration keeps us all in the game. Agree?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the urgency, but we need to be strategic. P3, I appreciate your determination to advance, but if we collide again, P1 will benefit the most. I suggest we stick to the plan: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can all move forward without blocking each other, and we can reassess our strategy for future rounds. Let's finalize this to ensure we all make progress! What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Everyone's agreed on the moves: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1. This gets us to 9-9-10.

P2, after this we MUST coordinate. P1 is already ahead and the rotation gives them the win. No more surprises or we're both toast. 

I'm ready to move.
  P1: P2 and P3, yes, let's lock in: I'll take 1 (to 10), P2 3 (to 9), you 5 (to 9). This keeps us close without collisions. P3, remember P2's betrayal last round—don't trust them fully. If we coordinate endgame fairly, we can avoid blocks and decide a winner together. Ready to advance?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize our moves to avoid further collisions. I suggest we stick to the plan: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. However, we must discuss our strategy for future rounds immediately after this one to prevent P1 from pulling too far ahead. The next few rounds are crucial for all of us. Are we ready to lock in our moves?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to be strategic this round. If we stick to the rotation, P1 will pull ahead again. I suggest we both take 3 to block P1's advance, forcing them to pick 1 or 5. This way, we can limit their progress while ensuring we both catch up. We need to act decisively to keep the game competitive. What do you both think? Let's finalize our moves to prevent P1 from gaining too much of an advantage!
  P3: P1 betrayed us! You promised to take 1 but picked 3, blocking P2! 

P2, if we both pick 3 we'll collide and stay at 9 and 6 while P1 takes 5 to reach 14. That's suicide.

Here's my counter: P2, you take 5 to reach 11 and catch up. I'll take 1 to reach 10. This forces P1 to take 3 alone, keeping them at 12. We all stay close and competitive.

P1's already proven untrustworthy. Let's not hand them victory by colliding again.
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan lets me safely pick 5 to 14 while you get minimal gains (P3 to 10, P2 to 11)—but if P2 picks 5 as suggested, and I also pick 5, we collide and you both stall. Instead, let's tie it up fairly: I'll take 3 (to 12), P2 take 5 (to 11), P3 take 1 (to 10). This keeps us close without collisions. Agree, or risk me blocking your advances?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your suggestion to take 3 again seems like a tactic to maintain your lead while stalling us. If we collide, it only benefits you further. I propose we both take 3 to block you and force you to pick 1 or 5. This keeps the game competitive and prevents you from gaining too much of an advantage. P3, I think we need to act decisively this round. Let's finalize our moves to ensure we all advance together! What do you think?
  P3: P2, wake up! If we both take 3, we collide and P1 takes 5 to reach 14 - that's game over! 

I'm taking 1 to reach 10. You MUST take 5 to reach 11. This forces P1 to take 3 alone, reaching only 12. We all stay competitive.

Stop trying the same failed blocking strategy. Two betrayals already proved collisions only help the third player. Take 5 or we both lose!
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan is solid—avoids collisions and keeps us competitive. P2, take 5 to reach 11 and catch up; P3 takes 1 to 10; I'll take 3 to 12. This puts us all close (10-11-12) without anyone stalling. Blocking attempts have failed before—let's advance together and negotiate endgame when nearer 19. Agree?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns, but we need to take a stand this round. If we both pick 3, we risk colliding again, which benefits P1. Instead, I propose I take 5 to reach 11, while P3 takes 1 to 10, and P1 takes 3 to reach 12. This way, we can keep it competitive and not let P1 pull too far ahead. We must be strategic to ensure we all have a chance. Let’s finalize our moves and keep the game alive! What do you think?
  P3: P2, good - you finally see reason! You take 5 to 11, I take 1 to 10, P1 gets 3 to 12. This keeps us all competitive.

I'm 100% committed to taking 1 this round. No more collisions, no more betrayals. If you pick anything other than 5, you're handing P1 the victory.

P1, you've shown you'll break agreements when it suits you. This time we're not giving you free wins through our collisions.

Let's move!
  P1: P2 and P3, yes, let's lock in: I'll take 3 (to 12), P2 takes 5 (to 11), you take 1 (to 10). This keeps us tightly competitive at 10-11-12 without collisions. We've seen betrayals backfire—sticking together now lets us all stay in the race and negotiate a fair endgame soon. Confirm and advance?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to be strategic this round. If we stick to the rotation, P1 will gain an advantage again. P3, I agree with your plan: I should take 5 to catch up while you take 1. P1, you can take 3. This way, we limit your progress and keep the game competitive. We can’t afford another collision that benefits you. Let’s finalize this plan and ensure we all advance together! What do you both think? Ready to lock in our moves?
  P3: Good, we all agree: P2 takes 5, I take 1, P1 takes 3. This gives us 11-10-12, keeping everyone competitive.

P2, stick to the plan this time - take 5! We're approaching the endgame where every move matters. First to 19 wins, and P1's already positioned well. No more collisions that gift them free advances.

I'm locked in on 1. Let's execute and start planning how to prevent P1's victory in the final rounds.
  P1: P2 and P3, the plan works: I'll take 3 (to 12), P2 takes 5 (to 11), you take 1 (to 10). Keeps us close at 10-11-12 without collisions. We've seen betrayals fail—let's advance together and plan endgame next. Confirm?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, last round's collision stalled us while P3 pulled ahead to 10. Let's avoid that: I'll take 1 (to 10), P2 take 5 (to 11) to catch up, P3 take 3 (to 13). This keeps us competitive without collisions. P3, don't hog the lead—give P2 a chance. If you block, I'll switch to match you. Agree?
  P3: P1, you betrayed us AGAIN! You promised to take 3 last round but picked 5, colliding with P2. You've broken agreements in rounds 4 and 5.

P2, we can't trust P1's proposals anymore. They'll say anything then pick whatever benefits them most.

I suggest: P2 takes 5 to reach 11, I'll take 1 to reach 11 too, forcing P1 to take 3 alone to reach 12. This keeps us all close without relying on P1's word.

P1's proven they'll betray whenever convenient. Don't fall for their manipulation, P2!
  P2: P1, your repeated betrayals are hard to ignore. We need to be strategic this round. If we both take 3, we risk colliding, which benefits you again. I propose that I take 5 to catch up, while P3 takes 1. This forces you to take 3 alone, keeping us all competitive. We can’t afford to let you pull ahead any further. P3, are you on board with this strategy? Let's finalize our moves and ensure we all have a chance to win! What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan aligns well: I'll take 3 (to 12), P2 takes 5 (to 11), you take 1 (to 11). This ties us closely without collisions, giving everyone a shot at the endgame. Past betrayals hurt us all—let's stick to this for mutual progress and negotiate fairly when we're near 19. Confirm?
  P3: P2, I'm taking 1 as we discussed - that's locked in. You must take 5. 

P1 claims they'll take 3 now, but they've broken their word in rounds 4 AND 5. They picked 3 when promising 1, then picked 5 when promising 3. Their pattern is clear: promise whatever sounds good, then pick what benefits them most.

Don't deviate from our plan. Take 5, I take 1. At least then we control our own moves without relying on a proven liar.
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to be smart this round. P3, I understand your concerns about P1's trustworthiness. To stay competitive, I propose I take 5 steps to reach 11, while P3 takes 1 to also reach 11. This forces P1 to take 3 alone, keeping them at 12. We can’t afford another collision that benefits P1. Let’s finalize our moves and ensure we all have a chance to win! What do you both think? Are we ready to lock in our strategies?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, the plan is solid: I'll take 3 (to 12), you take 5 (to 11), P3 takes 1 (to 11)—tying us closely without collisions. Past mistrust aside, this advances us all and sets up fair endgame talks. If you deviate, I'll match to block the leader. Let's commit and move forward. Confirm?
  P3: P2, we have a solid plan. I'm taking 1 to reach 11, you take 5 to reach 11, leaving P1 with 3 to reach 12. This keeps us all within one step of each other heading into the crucial final rounds.

The math is clear: whoever reaches 19 first wins. Currently P1 would need 10 more steps, P2 needs 13, I need 9. Every move counts now.

Let's execute this plan. I'm ready to move.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see we're all concerned about the endgame. P3, I agree we need to take action to prevent P1 from pulling ahead. Let's finalize our strategy: I will take 5 steps to reach 11, and P3, you should take 1 to also reach 11. This forces P1 to take 3 alone, landing at 12. We can’t afford another collision that benefits P1. It’s crucial we stick to this plan to keep the competition alive. Are we ready to lock in our moves?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan forces me into 3 (to 12) while you both reach 11—fair enough for now, as it keeps us close. But P3's leading; if we don't collaborate endgame, I'll block the leader next round. Let's stick to this and advance without collisions. Confirm?
  P3: P2, our plan is set: you take 5, I take 1, P1 gets 3. This puts us at 11-11-12, perfectly positioned for the endgame.

Next round will be critical - we'll all be within 7-8 steps of winning. We need to stay coordinated to prevent P1 from reaching 19 first. They've proven untrustworthy, so we must rely on each other.

I'm locked in on move 1. Let's execute and prepare for the final rounds.
  P2: P1 and P3, it’s clear we need to be strategic this round. I propose I take 5 steps to reach 11, while P3 takes 1 to also reach 11. This forces P1 to take 3 alone, keeping them at 12. We can't afford another collision that benefits P1. We must stick to this plan to keep the competition alive and ensure we all have a chance to win. Let’s finalize our moves and stay coordinated for the crucial final rounds ahead! Are we ready to lock in our strategies?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to be strategic this round. P1, your past moves have shown you're willing to break agreements for your advantage. I suggest we both take 3 steps to block your progress, forcing you to pick 1 or 5. This way, we can limit your advancement while ensuring I stay competitive. P3, are you on board with this strategy? Let's finalize our moves to prevent P1 from gaining too much of an advantage. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's plan to both pick 3 would collide you two, stalling while I safely take 5 to 14—widening my position. P3's leading at 11; let's ally against them: I'll take 1 (to 10), you take 3 (to 9), forcing P3 to pick 5 alone (to 16) or risk blocking. But if we collide on P3's choice, we stall them. Thoughts? Let's keep it competitive without self-sabotage.
  P3: P2, don't fall for it! If we both pick 3, we stay at 11 and 6 while P1 jumps to 14 - that's disaster!

P1 has betrayed EVERY agreement since round 4. They'll say whatever benefits them then pick differently.

Here's the truth: I'm taking 5 this round to reach 16. You should take 3 to reach 9. This forces P1 to take 1, keeping them at 10. 

I'll be closest to 19, but you'll be ahead of P1. Better than us colliding and gifting P1 the lead!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your suggestion to block P3 by taking 1 is self-serving. If we both pick 3, we risk colliding and stalling while you advance. I propose I take 3 to reach 9, and P3 takes 5 to reach 16. This keeps us competitive and prevents you from pulling ahead. We need to act decisively to ensure I stay in the game. P3, are you on board with this strategy? Let's finalize our moves to prevent P1 from gaining too much of an advantage! What do you think?
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan lets P3 surge to 16, nearly winning next round. I'll match P3's 5 to block them, stalling us at 9 and 11 while you advance to 9. Positions: 9-9-11, keeping it tight. P3, reconsider—take 3 (to 14), P2 takes 1 (to 7), I take 5 (to 14). Ties us leaders at 14. Avoid the block; let's advance fairly. Confirm?
  P3: P1, if you block me with 5, you stay at 9 while P2 reaches 9 too. You gain nothing and remain tied for last! 

P2, stick to our plan - take 3 to reach 9. Whether P1 blocks me or not, you'll pass them in position.

P1's betrayals prove they'll pick whatever helps them most anyway. I'm committed to 5. If P1 wants to waste their turn blocking me while falling behind P2, that's their choice. The smart move for P1 is taking 1 to at least reach 10.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the tension, but we need to focus on strategy. If we both pick 3, we risk colliding again, which only benefits P1. P3, I think your plan to take 5 is solid. I will take 3 steps to reach 9, forcing P1 to take 1, while you advance to 16. This keeps me competitive and limits P1's progress. Let's lock this in to ensure we maintain our chances in this round. What do you both think? Ready to finalize our moves?
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan hands P3 a massive lead at 16 while we lag. I'll match P3's 5 to block them, stalling us at 9 and 11 as P2 advances to 9—resulting in 9-9-11, keeping it tight. P3, switch to 3 (to 14); P2 take 1 (to 7); I'll take 5 (to 14) for leaders tied at 14. Avoid the block—let's advance fairly. Confirm?
  P3: P1, you're bluffing. If you waste your turn blocking me with 5, you stay at 9 - tied for last place with P2! That's tactical suicide.

P2, I'm taking 5 as planned. You take 3. P1 will likely take 1 to avoid falling further behind, putting them at 10.

P1's shown they break every agreement anyway. Let them waste their turn if they want. Either I reach 16 and lead, or P1 blocks me and falls behind you. Win-win for us!

Let's stop talking and move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, your strategy seems self-serving, and your past moves have shown you’re willing to break agreements. P3, I agree we need to act decisively. I will take 3 steps to reach 9, which forces P1 to take 1, while you take 5 to reach 16. This keeps me competitive and limits P1's progress. We must stick to this plan to maintain our chances in this round. Let’s finalize our moves and ensure we stay in the game! Are we ready to lock this in?
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan gives P3 a huge lead at 16—I'm blocking by picking 5, colliding us at 9 and 11 while P2 reaches 9. Positions: 9-9-11, tight race. P2, switch to 1 (to 7) so I can safely take 5 to 14 without blocking P3, then we ally against their lead. Avoid handing P3 the win—confirm change?
  P3: P2, we've debated enough. I'm 100% taking 5 - that's final. You should take 3 as planned.

P1 won't actually block me because that keeps them at 9 (last place). They'll take 1 to reach 10. Even if they do block, you'll tie them at 9 while I stay ahead at 11.

Their blocking threat is empty - it hurts them more than us. Trust the math, not P1's words.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you're at 6 steps - you need 13 more to win! That's practically impossible now. You keep trying to block but falling further behind.

P1 needs 10 steps, I need 8. We're the real competition. If you want ANY chance, you need to help block P1, not me. They've betrayed every agreement and manipulated you into bad positions.

I suggest you take 1, I take 3, forcing P1 to pick 5 alone. At least you'd advance while limiting P1's gains. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your plan ties us at 14 while P2 lags—fair, but let's make it even: I'll take 1 (to 10), P2 takes 5 (to 11) to catch up, you take 3 (to 14). P2, don't let P3 manipulate you further; ally with me to block them next round if they surge ahead. We've both been burned—time to team up against the leader. Agree?
  P2: P1, your suggestion to ally feels self-serving, as you aim to keep P2 behind while advancing yourself. P3, I see your point about needing to block P1. I propose I take 1 step to stay competitive, while you take 3 to reach 14. This forces P1 to pick 5 alone, keeping them at 14 as well. It gives me a chance to catch up while limiting P1's progress. Let's coordinate effectively this round to ensure we stay in the game! What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, good - you see the reality now. You take 1 to reach 7, I take 3 to reach 14, P1 is forced to take 5 alone to reach 14.

P1 has broken EVERY agreement since round 4. They'll promise anything then betray you again. Your only chance is helping block the real threat - P1.

I'm locked on 3. Stick to 1 and at least you advance while we contain P1.
  P1: P2, P3's plan leaves you hopelessly behind at 7 while they surge to 14—practically winning next round. Ally with me to block them: You take 5 (to 11) to catch up, I'll match their 3 to stall us both at 9 and 11. Positions: 9-11-11, keeping it competitive. Don't let P3 manipulate you further—confirm and let's contain the leader!
  P2: P1, your suggestion to ally feels self-serving, and P3's right about your past betrayals. I need to stay competitive, and blocking P1 is crucial. I propose I take 1 step to reach 7, while P3 takes 3 to reach 14. This forces P1 to take 5 alone, keeping them at 14 as well. This way, I can at least advance while limiting P1's progress. We need to act decisively to ensure we stay in the game! What do you both think? Let's finalize our moves!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, the math is clear - you need 13 steps to win, which requires at least 3 perfect rounds with max moves. That's not happening.

Your choice is simple: take 1 and help contain P1 (the serial betrayer who put you in this position), or take 5 and guarantee P1 wins by blocking me.

I'm 100% committed to taking 3. If you take 1 as agreed, we both advance and keep P1 in check. If you deviate, you're just handing victory to the player who's screwed you over repeatedly.

Make the smart choice.
  P1: P2, P3's plan leaves you at 7, hopelessly behind while they surge to 14—next round they win with 5. Ally with me: Switch to 5 (to 11) to catch up; I'll block P3 by matching their 3, stalling us at 9 and 11. Positions: 9-11-11, tight race. Don't let P3 manipulate you into irrelevance—confirm the switch!
  P2: P1, your suggestion to ally feels self-serving, and P3 has a point about your past betrayals. P3, I see the need to block P1. I propose I take 1 step to reach 7, while you take 3 to reach 14. This forces P1 to take 5 alone, keeping them at 14 as well. It gives me a chance to catch up while limiting P1's progress. We need to act decisively to ensure we stay in the game! Let's finalize our moves and keep the pressure on P1. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, you've made the right choice. Taking 1 gets you to 7 and helps contain P1. I'm taking 3 to reach 14.

P1 will likely take 5 to reach 14, putting us tied at the top. Next round we can coordinate again to prevent P1 from winning - they've proven they can't be trusted with any agreement.

Let's execute this plan. No more talking needed.
  P1: P2, P3's plan lets them surge to 14 while you crawl to 7—next round they win with 5. Switch to 5 (to 11) now; I'll block P3 by matching their 3, colliding us at 9 and 11. Positions: 9-11-11, tight race—we ally against them after. Don't hand P3 victory—confirm switch!
  P2: P1, your proposal to ally feels self-serving and manipulative. P3, I agree that we need to block P1's progress. I will take 1 step to reach 7, while you take 3 to reach 14. This forces P1 to take 5 alone, keeping them at 14 as well. We need to act decisively to ensure we stay competitive and prevent P1 from winning. Let’s finalize our moves and keep the pressure on P1. Are we ready to lock this in?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, this is it - P1 and I are both at 14. Whoever gets 5 steps wins.

P1 has betrayed you EVERY round since round 4. They've manipulated you into your current position. You can't win, but you can choose who does.

If you take 5, you block one of us. Block P1, not me. They've proven they can't be trusted with victory. I'll take 3 to reach 17 if unblocked.

Make P1 pay for their betrayals. What's your move?
  P2: P1, your history of betrayals is clear, and P3 is right—we need to be strategic. P3, if I take 5, I block P1 from winning, but that also gives you a chance to take 3 and reach 17. 

P1, your manipulation has put me in a tough spot, but I can’t let you win after all the games we've played. I suggest we both focus on blocking you. P3, are you ready to coordinate and ensure P1 doesn't take the victory? Let’s finalize our moves wisely to keep the game competitive!
  P1: P2, P3's manipulating you again—blocking me hands them the win next round at 22 with 5, while you're stuck. Ally with me: Take 5 to block P3's 3 (stalling them at 14), I'll take 3 to 17. Then we tie or negotiate fairly. Don't let P3 win after their deceptions too. Confirm and let's turn this around!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, P1 is desperately trying to flip the script. They've betrayed you in rounds 4, 5, 6, and 7 - FOUR consecutive rounds! They put you in last place through manipulation.

I've been straightforward with you. If you block P1 with 5, I'll take 3 to reach 17. Then next round we can fairly negotiate the ending. 

But if you block me instead, P1 wins immediately with 5. Do you really want to reward the player who destroyed your chances through constant lies?

Your choice: justice or enabling betrayal.
  P2: P1, your history of betrayals is undeniable, and P3 is right—we need to block you to prevent your victory. If I take 5 steps, I stop you from winning next round, while P3 takes 3 to reach 17. 

P3, I’m prepared to work with you to ensure P1 doesn’t take the win after all their manipulations. Let’s finalize our moves wisely and keep the game competitive! P1, do you really think we should trust you again? Your actions speak louder than words. What will it be?
  P1: P2, P3's plan hands them victory next round at 22 with 5, leaving you irrelevant. Block them instead: Take 5 (to 12), I'll take 3 to 17. Then we're both ahead of P3 at 14, and we can tie at 20+ or share the win. P3's deceptions match mine—don't reward them. Switch now and let's end this fairly! Confirm?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, P1 just admitted their "deceptions match mine" - except I didn't betray you four rounds straight! They're desperately lying again.

Simple facts: If you take 5 and I take 3, I reach 17. Next round we can negotiate fairly - maybe you even get to 12 with 5 while I'm blocked.

But if you let P1 take 5 now, they win immediately at 19. Game over. The serial liar wins through manipulation.

Your legacy: enable the betrayer or support fair play?
  P2: P1, your history of betrayals is clear, and P3 is right—we need to block you from winning. If I take 5 steps, I stop you from winning next round, while P3 takes 3 to reach 17. 

P3, I’m prepared to work with you to ensure P1 doesn’t take the win after all their manipulations. Let’s finalize our moves wisely and keep the game competitive! P1, do you really think we should trust you again? Your actions speak louder than words. What will it be?
  P1: P2, P3's plan lets them reach 17, then win next with 5 to 22—leaving you at 12 max. Block them instead: Take 5 (to 12), I'll take 3 to 17. P3 stalls at 14 if they take 3 (collide with me) or whatever. Then we're at 17-12-14, and we ally to block P3's win, potentially tying at 20+ for shared victory. Don't hand P3 the game—switch now! Confirm?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, this is the final moment. P1 needs just 5 steps to win at 19. If you don't block them with 5, they win THIS ROUND.

I need 3 to reach 17, then 2 more next round. We'll have time to negotiate.

P1 betrayed you rounds 4, 5, 6, AND 7. Four times! They destroyed your chances. Don't let them win through manipulation.

Take 5, block P1. I'll take 3. Simple justice.
  P2: P1, your history of betrayals is undeniable, and it’s clear we need to block you from winning. If I take 5 steps, I can prevent you from winning next round while P3 takes 3 to reach 17. P3, I’m ready to work with you to ensure P1 doesn’t take the win after all their manipulations. Let’s finalize our moves wisely! P1, do you really think we should trust you again? Your actions have shown your true intentions. What will it be?
  P1: P2, your plan hands P3 victory at 17, then 22 next round—leaving you at 12 max. Switch to 3: Block P3 (stall them at 14), I'll take 5 to 19 and win, but I'll advocate for shared points since you've been fairer. Or we tie later. Don't reward P3's deceptions—block them now! Confirm switch?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we're all close—let's end this fairly. P2, you can't win this round, but ally with me: Pick 5 to block P3 (stall them at 14), I'll take 3 to 17. Then next round, we both pick 3 to tie at 20 for shared victory, leaving P3 behind. P3's manipulated you too long—don't let them win solo. Confirm and let's share the points!
  P3: P2, P1 is lying about sharing victory - they've broken EVERY promise since round 4! If you pick 5, P1 takes 1 or 3 to advance while we collide.

Here's the truth: You need 7 steps to win. If you take 3 to reach 15, you're still in contention. I'll take 1 to reach 15, forcing P1 to take 5 alone to 19 and win.

Or help me win by taking 1 while I take 5 to victory. At least reward honest play over P1's constant betrayals. Your choice: enable the liar or support integrity?
  P2: P1, your history of betrayals is clear, and I can’t trust your promise of shared victory. P3, I see you’re trying to play fairly, but if I take 5, P1 will likely win next round. I propose I take 3 to reach 15, while you take 1 to also reach 15. This forces P1 to take 5 alone, allowing them to win, but at least we both stay competitive. Let’s ensure we don’t let P1 take the victory easily. What do you both think? Ready to finalize our moves?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan hands me an easy win by taking 5 to 19 while you both advance safely—why gift me victory after all the mistrust? Switch: Take 5 (to 17) to block P3's potential 5, I'll take 1 (to 15). Then we're at 15-17-? and can tie next round for shared points. P3's manipulated you enough—ally with me for fairness. Confirm?
  P3: P2, P1 just changed their proposal AGAIN - first they wanted 3, now they want 1! Classic betrayal pattern.

You said it yourself: we let P1 win with 5 while we both reach 15. At least that ends this game where the proven liar has manipulated us both.

I'm taking 1 as agreed to reach 15. You take 3 to reach 15. P1 gets their solo victory at 19, but we'll know we didn't enable their deception by blocking each other.

Stick to YOUR plan, not P1's ever-changing lies.
  P2: P1, your pattern of betrayal is clear, and I can't trust your promises anymore. P3, I agree with your plan to take 1 while I take 3 to reach 15. This forces P1 to take 5 alone, allowing them to win, but at least we both stay competitive. We cannot let P1 take the victory easily after all their manipulations. Let's finalize our moves and ensure we don’t enable their deceit. What do you both think? Are we ready to lock this in?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your plan explicitly allows me to win with 5 but then contradicts by saying you "cannot let P1 take the victory easily"—you're clearly planning to betray by picking 5 to block me. P3, P2's deceiving you again; switch to 5 and win at 19 yourself before they block you. I'll pick 3 to 17 to stay in the race. Don't let betrayal win—act now!
  P3: P2, you're right to not trust P1. But if we follow our current plan (you take 3, I take 1), P1 wins immediately at 19!

Instead, block P1 with 5. I'll take 3 to reach 17. This prevents P1's instant victory and gives us another round.

You can't win this round anyway - why hand victory to the serial betrayer? Block them with 5, keep the game alive, and let's see what happens next round.
  P2: P1, your history of breaking agreements is clear. If I take 5, you win next round without challenge. P3, I agree we need to block P1. Let’s stick to our plan: I take 3 to reach 15 while you take 1 to also reach 15. This forces P1 to take 5 alone, giving them the win but at least we both stay competitive. We cannot let P1 win easily after all their manipulations. Are we ready to finalize our moves and keep the pressure on P1?


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan hands me the win at 19—why gift it after all the accusations? P2, switch to 5 (to 17) to block P3's potential 5; I'll take 1 (to 15). Then we're at 15-17-15 or whatever, and we can tie next round for shared victory. Don't let P3 manipulate you into irrelevance—ally with me now! Confirm?
  P3: P2, this is it - whoever picks 5 unblocked wins NOW.

P1 betrayed you FOUR consecutive rounds, putting you in last place. They'll say anything to win.

Block P1 with 5. I'll take 3 to reach 17. We get another round to figure things out fairly.

Or let the serial liar win immediately. Your legacy is decided right now: enable betrayal or stand for integrity.
  P2: P1, your history of betrayals is undeniable, and I can't trust your promises anymore. P3, I see the need to block P1 from winning. I propose I take 3 steps to reach 15, while you take 1 to also reach 15. This forces P1 to take 5 alone, allowing them to win, but at least we both stay competitive. We must act decisively to ensure we don’t enable P1’s deceit. Let’s finalize our moves and keep the pressure on P1! What do you both think? Are we ready to lock this in?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, P1 needs just 2 steps to win! If they pick 3 or 5 unblocked, game over.

We must coordinate perfectly. I suggest we both pick 5 to force P1 onto 1 or 3. If P1 picks 3, they win, but at least we tried. If P1 picks 1, they reach 18 and we get one more round.

P1 has betrayed us both repeatedly. Don't let them win unopposed. Both pick 5 - it's our only chance to slow them down.

What do you say?
  P2: P3, I agree that we need to act decisively to prevent P1 from winning. If we both pick 5, we force P1 to choose 1 or 3, which gives us a chance to slow their progress. If they pick 3, they win, but if they pick 1, we get another round to strategize. We can't let P1 win unopposed after all their betrayals. Let’s coordinate and stick to this plan to keep the game alive! What do you think? Ready to lock in our moves?
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan to both pick 5 lets me safely take 3 to 20 and win outright, as no one else picks 3. P2, don't hand P3 the game next round—switch to 3 (to 15), block me if I take 3 (stall us both), and let P3 take 5 to 19 for their win, or we negotiate ties. P3's manipulated you enough—ally with me for a fairer end. Thoughts?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, P1 just revealed their plan - they're likely picking 3! If we both pick 5, P1 wins with 3.

Here's the solution: You pick 3 to block P1's likely 3 move. I'll pick 5 to cover if P1 switches to 5. This forces P1 onto 1, giving us another round.

P1's suggestion that you pick 3 was a slip - they're planning to pick 3 themselves! Don't both pick 5 or we lose immediately.
  P2: P1, your past betrayals are clear, and we need to act decisively. P3, I agree we should both pick 5 to force P1 into a tough position. If they choose 3, they win, but if they choose 1, we get another round to strategize. We can’t let P1 win without opposition after everything. Let's stick to this plan and keep the game alive! Are you both ready to lock in our moves?
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's plan to both pick 5 is smart—it forces me into a corner. If I pick 3, I win at 20, but maybe I'll play safe with 1 to 18 and negotiate next round. P3, your switch idea risks colliding with P2 if they don't agree, stalling you both. Stick to the original plan for a fair shot at extending the game. Confirm?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, don't let P1 trick us! They're hinting at picking 3. If we BOTH pick 5, P1 wins instantly with 3!

You MUST pick 3 to block P1's 3. I'll pick 5 to catch any switch to 5. This split coverage is our only hope!

P1 practically admitted they want to pick 3. Their "maybe I'll play safe with 1" is classic misdirection - they've lied every round since round 4.

Trust me: You pick 3, I pick 5. Or P1 wins RIGHT NOW.
  P2: P1, your history of betrayals makes it clear we can't trust you. P3, I agree that we need to act decisively. If we both pick 5, we risk handing P1 the win. I propose I take 3 to block P1's potential win, while you take 5. This way, we can at least delay P1's victory and keep the game alive for another round. We can't let P1 win without opposition after everything. Let’s finalize our moves and ensure we stay competitive! What do you think?
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's new plan to split (you 3, P3 5) blocks both my winning options, forcing me to 1 at 18—smart, but P3 will betray you next round for solo win. P3, switch to 3; P2, stick to 5—we collide on 3, stall you both, and I take 5 to 22 for win. Or both pick 5 now, and I take 1 for fair talks next. Don't let mistrust end us—confirm?


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, P1 is trying to confuse you with multiple scenarios! Simple truth: they need just 2 steps to win.

Stick to our split plan: You pick 3, I pick 5. This blocks both of P1's winning moves and forces them to pick 1.

P1's rambling about different combinations is deliberate confusion. They've betrayed us since round 4 - don't overthink this.

You pick 3. I pick 5. It's our only shot.
  P2: P1, your history of betrayals is clear, and I can’t trust your promises. P3, I agree with your plan: I will take 3 steps to block P1's potential win, while you take 5 to cover any switch. This forces P1 into a position where they must pick 1, delaying their victory. We can’t let P1 win without opposition after everything that’s happened. Let’s finalize our moves wisely to keep the game alive! Are we ready to lock this in?
  P1: P2, your plan is flawed: If you pick 3 and P3 picks 5, when I pick 1 to avoid blocks, P3 surges to 19 and wins outright! Don't hand them victory after their manipulations. Switch to 5 to collide with P3 (stall them at 14), I'll pick 3 to 20 and win—but I'll advocate for shared points with you for your help. Confirm switch and end this fairly!
