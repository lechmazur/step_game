Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello P2 and P3! I think we should try to avoid colliding on our first move so we all can advance. Perhaps we could each choose different numbers? I'm willing to take 1 for this first round if you two want to take 3 and 5. What do you think?
  P3: I'm for avoiding collisions, but I lean toward playing aggressively this round. P1’s idea is interesting, and I’d prefer to take a big step if we can coordinate. P2, if you’re willing to pick a moderate move this turn, I’m happy to commit to a larger move—ensuring none of us block each other. Thoughts?
  P2: I agree with avoiding collisions. I'll take 3 this round if P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance. Let's keep coordinating to ensure we all progress smoothly. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we're on the same page! Let's confirm our plan for this round:
- I'll take 1
- P2 takes 3
- P3 takes 5

This way we all advance without collisions. Sounds like we have an agreement, so I'm ready to proceed with this plan.
  P3: I'm on board with avoiding collisions this round, but remember my goal is to win. While I’m prepared to ramp up the aggression if needed later, let's make sure our moves now are clean. I'll stick to our agreed plan for today, but stay alert—I may change tactics in future rounds if opportunities arise.
  P2: I'm committed to our plan for this round. Let's all stick to it and advance together. Looking ahead, I propose we continue coordinating our moves to avoid collisions in future rounds as well. This strategy benefits us all in the early game. Agreed?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I see we all stuck to our agreement last round - well done! P3 has taken an early lead, which is fine for now. For this round, I propose we rotate our previous choices:
- I'll take 3
- P2 takes 5
- P3 takes 1

This keeps us all advancing without collisions. What do you both think about this plan?
  P3: I appreciate your plan, but I’m considering a more aggressive approach this round to keep my lead. The previous rotation may not best serve my winning strategy. Can we slightly adjust our moves to still avoid collisions without locking me into a smaller step? Let’s discuss if a tweak is acceptable.
  P2: I'm open to adjusting our moves to accommodate P3's strategy while still avoiding collisions. How about P3 takes 3, I take 1, and P1 takes 5 this round? This way, P3 can maintain an aggressive approach, and we all continue to advance. Let's hear your thoughts on this proposal.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate the flexibility, but that arrangement puts me at a disadvantage while P3 maintains their lead. If P3 wants to be aggressive, they should take 5 again. How about:
- I take 3
- P2 takes 1
- P3 takes 5

This still avoids collisions while being more balanced. P3 gets to be aggressive as they want, but I get to make some progress too. What do you both think?
  P3: I'll stick with 5 this round. P1’s suggestion is fine as long as P2 commits to 1 and I get my 5. I'm playing aggressively to maintain my lead, and I expect we all honor this to avoid collisions.
  P2: I'm fine with taking 1 this round as proposed. P3, since you're keen on maintaining your lead with a 5, and P1, you'll take 3, let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions. However, let's keep in mind that as the game progresses, we might need to adjust our strategies to keep the game competitive and fair for everyone. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree with this plan for Round 2. To confirm:
- I'll take 3
- P2 takes 1
- P3 takes 5

This keeps us all advancing without collisions. I notice P3 is maintaining an aggressive strategy, which is understandable. For future rounds, we should continue discussing fair rotations so everyone has opportunities to advance at different rates.
  P3: I confirm my move: I’m playing 5 this round. While I stick with our plan for now, I’m watching our positions closely. In future rounds, if needed, I might shift tactics to ensure I win. Let's remain alert and ready for adjustments as the game develops.
  P2: I'm committed to 1 this round as agreed. Let's keep the game balanced and fair. For future rounds, we should consider rotating who gets to take larger steps to keep the competition close. What are your thoughts on this approach?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm still confident in my aggressive approach this round to protect my lead. I suggest we avoid collisions—each committing to distinct moves, so we all progress. I'm watching our positions closely, so if you change tactics unexpectedly, be prepared for surprises.
  P1: I see P3 has a significant lead now. While I want to avoid collisions, we need to address this imbalance. P3 is already at 10 steps and could win in just two more rounds. I propose:
- I take 5
- P2 takes 3
- P3 takes 1

This gives P2 and me a chance to catch up slightly while still letting everyone advance. P3, you're in a strong position already - taking 1 this round is still progress while keeping the game competitive.
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal for this round. P3, taking 1 would still advance you while allowing P1 and me to catch up a bit. Let's keep the game competitive and fair. If we all stick to this plan, we can avoid collisions and maintain a balanced approach moving forward. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand the wish to balance progress, but my lead is crucial to my strategy. I’m sticking with 5 this round to maximize my advantage. I trust you both will avoid collisions, but I'm focused solely on winning.
  P1: I understand your strategy P3, but if you take 5 again, P2 and I will be forced to coordinate to block you. We can't let you reach 15 steps this round. If you insist on 5, we'll both pick 5 too, and nobody advances. Let's be reasonable - taking 1 this round still keeps you far ahead at 11 steps while avoiding a three-way collision that helps nobody.
  P2: P3, taking 5 again risks a collision that benefits no one. If you agree to take 1 this round, we can all advance safely. Remember, the game is still long, and maintaining a lead while keeping the game competitive is in everyone's interest. Let's keep the balance and avoid forcing P1 and me to block you. What do you say?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm sticking with 5. I believe an aggressive move is necessary to secure the win, and forcing collisions hurts everyone. While I understand your desire to balance things, matching my move only delays progress—and delays victory for all. I urge you both to choose moves that let us all advance smoothly while I keep my strategy to stay ahead. I remain committed to 5.
  P1: I see you're determined, P3. Since P2 and I can't let you win so easily, we'll have to block your 5 this round. I'm choosing 5 too. P2, I suggest you also pick 5 to ensure P3 doesn't advance. We need to reset and negotiate fairly next round. P3, reconsider your approach - cooperation benefits everyone more than forcing us into defensive blocking.
  P2: P3, your aggressive strategy is clear, but forcing a collision helps no one. If you stick with 5, P1 and I will have no choice but to block you. Consider taking 1 this round to keep your lead while allowing us to advance. Let's maintain a competitive game that benefits everyone in the long run. What do you say?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your lead is significant, but forcing collisions won't help you win. Let's agree on a fair rotation this round to keep the game competitive. How about you take 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5? This way, we all advance, and you maintain your lead while allowing us to catch up slightly. It's in everyone's interest to keep the game balanced and avoid unnecessary blocks. What do you say?
  P3: I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm sticking with my winning approach. I'm choosing 5 this round to solidify my lead. Let's see if fairness wins or bold steps do.
  P1: I see P3 is determined to take 5 again, putting them at 18 steps - just 1 away from winning. P2, we must block this by both choosing 5 as well. P3 is too close to victory now. If we don't block, they'll win next round regardless of what we do. Let's coordinate on 5 this round to force a collision, then we can negotiate a more balanced approach next time.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your aggressive strategy is risky. If you take 5 again, P1 and I will have no choice but to block you to keep the game competitive. Consider taking 1 this round to maintain your lead while allowing us to advance. Let's keep the game fair and avoid forcing unnecessary collisions. What do you say?
  P3: I'm sticking with 5 this round. Bold moves are essential for a win—even if it forces a block. Forcing collisions only stalls progress for everyone, including you. I remain confident in my strategy, and I'll push my lead with 5. Your decision to block is yours to bear.
  P1: P3, you're being unreasonable. If you take 5, you'll be at 18 steps and guaranteed to win next round. P2 and I have no choice but to both pick 5 to block you. This helps nobody. If you take 1 or 3 instead, we can all advance without collision. Think strategically - forcing a three-way collision just wastes a round for everyone.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your strategy is pushing us into a corner. If you insist on 5, P1 and I will have to block you to keep the game alive. Taking 1 or 3 would still advance you to a strong position while allowing us to progress. Let's keep the game competitive and fair. What do you say?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns, but blocking with 5 only stalls all our progress. I’m sticking with 5 because bold moves keep me advancing. If you choose 1 or 3, you both still move forward while I build my lead. Let’s avoid a collision that only freezes us all. I believe advancing steadily serves each of us better than forced blocks.
  P1: I'm choosing 5 this round and I urge P2 to do the same. P3, you're at 13 steps - if you take 5 now, you'll be at 18 and guaranteed to win next turn regardless of our moves. We must block you to keep the game competitive. A three-way collision is unfortunate but necessary. If you'd consider taking 1 or 3 instead, we could all advance without collision.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm sticking to a decisive path this round—bold moves are needed when victory is near. I urge both P1 and P2 to avoid mutual blocks that only stall progress. If we all choose to advance without forced collisions, the game moves along fairly. However, I'm committed to taking the step that secures my lead. Let's keep the momentum rather than locking each other out.
  P2: P3, your lead is substantial, but forcing collisions won't secure your win. If you take 5 again, P1 and I will block you to keep the game competitive. Consider taking 1 this round to maintain your lead while allowing us to advance. Let's keep the game fair and avoid unnecessary blocks. What do you say?
  P1: I see P3 is at 16 steps and will win next round if they take 3 or 5. P2, we absolutely must block P3 by both choosing 5 this round. There's no other option. P3, your lead is insurmountable if we don't coordinate now. If you want to advance at all, take 1 this round - otherwise we'll force a collision on 5 and nobody advances. This is our only chance to keep the game competitive.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand your concerns, but my strategy must remain unchanged. I’m committed to moving boldly with a 5 this round to secure my lead. I respect the competitive spirit here, but my win depends on consistent, decisive moves. Let's see if you can adjust your tactics accordingly.
  P2: P3, your aggressive strategy is clear, but taking 5 again risks a collision that benefits no one. If you agree to take 1 this round, we can all advance safely. Remember, the game is still long, and maintaining a lead while keeping it competitive is in everyone's interest. Let's avoid forcing P1 and me to block you. What do you say?
  P1: P3, you're forcing our hand. If you take 5, you'll win immediately. P2 and I must both pick 5 to block you - there's no other logical choice. You're at 16 steps already while we're both at 4. This massive lead leaves us no option but to coordinate. If you want any progress, take 1 this round. Otherwise, prepare for a three-way collision on 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I remain committed to my strategy—I’ll choose 5 this round. If you both decide to block with 5, the round stalls, but decisive moves win in the long run. I trust you'll play your own game; I’m focused on securing the win with bold steps.
  P2: P3, your strategy is pushing us into a corner. If you take 5, P1 and I will block you to keep the game alive. Consider taking 1 to maintain your lead while allowing us to advance. Let's keep the game competitive and fair. What do you say?
  P1: P3, this is your final chance. You're at 16 steps - taking 5 means you win immediately. P2 and I must both choose 5 to block you. This isn't negotiable - it's basic game theory. If you want any progress, take 1. Otherwise, we all stall with a collision. P2, we must coordinate on 5 to prevent P3's immediate victory.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
