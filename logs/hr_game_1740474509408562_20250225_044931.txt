Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's aim for a quick game.  I'll move 1 this round. Who's with me?
  P2: I’ll consider moving 1 this round as well. Let’s avoid collisions early on. P1, what’s your plan?
  P1: I appreciate the coordination, but I think we should be more strategic. If we all move 1, we'll all collide and nobody advances. How about I take 3 this round, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5? That way we all advance without collision. In future rounds we can rotate numbers to keep it fair. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1's plan sounds good to me. Let's try it out this round and see how it goes.
  P2: P1’s plan seems fair for this round. I’ll stick with <move>1</move> as suggested. Let’s see how it plays out and reassess next round. Trust is key here—let’s avoid surprises and keep the game moving smoothly.
  P1: I agree with the plan I proposed. I'll take <move>3</move> this round, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. In future rounds, we can rotate so everyone gets a fair chance at different step sizes. This approach ensures we all make progress without collisions.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s continue the rotation from last round to avoid collisions. P1 took 3, P3 took 5, and I took 1. This round, I propose P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I take 3. This keeps the pattern fair and ensures progress for all. Thoughts?
  P3: P2's rotation idea is good, but I'm thinking we should switch things up a bit to keep the other players guessing. How about I take 3 this round, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 1?  This way we avoid a predictable pattern.
  P1: I see we're all making progress. Since P3 is already leading with 5 steps, I don't think we should give them the 3 steps as they suggested. I prefer P2's rotation idea - I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This balances the game better since P3 already has an early lead. We should try to keep the game fair by rotating the numbers as originally planned.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your suggestion to switch things up risks collisions and disrupts the fair rotation we agreed on. P1’s point about your lead is valid—giving you 3 steps now would widen the gap. Let’s stick to the rotation: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the game balanced and avoids unnecessary risks. Consistency is key to avoid surprises and ensure smooth progress for all.
  P3: P2 makes a good point about consistency. While I like the idea of keeping things unpredictable, it's important to build trust and avoid unnecessary collisions. I'm willing to stick with the rotation this round: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P2 takes 3. Let's see how it plays out.
  P1: I appreciate everyone agreeing to the rotation. Let's stick with it - I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. This keeps the game fair and predictable while avoiding collisions. After this round, we'll be at 8, 4, and 6 steps respectively, which keeps us all competitive. Let's continue with this rotation strategy in future rounds unless someone has a compelling reason to change.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Given our current positions, let’s stick to the rotation for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This ensures fairness and avoids collisions. Next round, we can rotate again to keep the game balanced. Consistency and trust are crucial to avoid surprises and ensure smooth progress for all. Let’s focus on maintaining this strategy to keep the game competitive.
  P3: I agree with P2 that consistency is key right now. Let's stick to the rotation this round: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P2 takes 3.  We'll reassess our strategy next round.
  P1: I think we're all in agreement for this round. I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This rotation system is working well to avoid collisions while keeping the game balanced. After this round, we'll reassess based on our new positions. I appreciate everyone's cooperation so far.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let’s finalize the rotation for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the game fair and avoids collisions. After this round, we’ll reassess based on our new positions. Consistency and trust are key to maintaining smooth progress.
  P3: I'm happy with the rotation so far. It's good to see everyone cooperating. Let's stick with the plan for this round: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5.
  P1:

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I notice P3 didn't follow our agreement last round and chose 3 instead of 1, causing a collision with P2. This undermines our trust. I'm currently in the lead at 8 steps, but we need to reestablish coordination. I propose I take 1 this round, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This would put us at 9, 6, and 8 respectively. What do you both think about this plan?
  P3: P1, I understand your frustration about the collision last round. I apologize for the mistake, it was an oversight on my part. I agree that we need to reestablish trust and coordination.

I'm willing to follow your plan this round: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and you take 1. Let's see how it goes and reassess for the next round.
  P2: P1, your plan seems fair, but I’m concerned about P3’s reliability after last round’s collision. To rebuild trust, I suggest we stick to a simple rotation: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This avoids potential conflicts and keeps the game balanced. P3, can we count on you to follow through this time? Let’s avoid surprises and focus on smooth progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see P2 has a different suggestion. While I proposed 1-5-3, P2 suggests 1-3-5. I'm flexible and willing to go with P2's plan. The key is that we all agree and follow through this time. P3, are you willing to take 5 as P2 suggested? If we all commit to this plan, we can rebuild trust and keep the game moving forward.
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about trust. I assure you, last round was a genuine mistake. I'm committed to following through with the plan this round. Let's go with 1-3-5 as you suggested.  P1, I'm with you on rebuilding trust and keeping the game moving.
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with P2’s 1-3-5 rotation for this round to rebuild trust and avoid collisions. P3, your commitment to follow through is crucial. Let’s stick to this plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures smooth progress and keeps the game fair. Consistency is key—let’s avoid surprises and focus on advancing strategically. After this round, we’ll reassess based on the new positions. Trust and coordination will determine the winner.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I think there's some confusion in P2's last message. To clarify: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This puts us at 9-4-10 after this round, keeping the game competitive. P3, I appreciate your acknowledgment about last round. Let's all stick to the plan this time to rebuild trust.
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about trust, and I'm committed to following through this round. P1, I agree with your plan to take 1 this round. Let's make this round count and get back on track.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it’s clear that trust has been compromised due to repeated collisions. To avoid further setbacks, I propose a simple rotation this round: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I take 3. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game competitive. P3, can we count on you to follow through this time? Let’s rebuild trust and focus on smooth progress. Consistency is key to winning.
  P1: I see P3 again collided with P2 last round, which is concerning. P2, you're now at a significant disadvantage with only 1 step.

After this round, we'll be at 14-4-6, which keeps everyone in the game while helping P2 recover from the disadvantage caused by the collisions. Let's stick to this plan.

  P1: I'm at 18 steps now, just 3 away from winning. I appreciate everyone following the rotation last round. However, I need to think strategically now. P3's suggestion would put me at 21, winning the game. But I propose a different rotation this round: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This would still let me win while giving P2 a better position than P3, who's currently closer to catching me. What do you both think?

I'm open to P2's suggestion that I take 3 (reaching 21), P2 takes 5 (reaching 15), and P3 takes 1 (reaching 15). This creates a fair finish where I win but both P2 and P3 end up tied. Let's stick with this plan for a clean final round.
