Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey everyone, let's coordinate so we don't collide immediately. I'll take 3 this round if that's okay with you both.
  P2: Sounds good. If you’re really taking 3, P3, then P1 could aim for 1, and I’ll go for 5. That way, none of us collide and we all move forward. But if someone tries to trick the others, at least be direct so we can plan accordingly. What do you say?
  P1: I'll take 1 as proposed. Let’s confirm our choices in the next sub-round to ensure no last-minute changes. Cooperation now gives us the best chance to avoid collisions early on.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm still committed to choosing 3 as I said. Let's stick to the plan.
  P2: I stand by choosing 5. Let’s trust each other for this first round so we all advance without clashing. Are we good to lock that in? If so, I’m ready to move on.
  P1: I confirm my choice of <move>1</move>. Let’s finalize this plan to avoid collisions and move forward safely. Any last objections? If not, I suggest we proceed.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: No objections from me. Let's proceed as planned.
  P2: I’m staying with 5 as planned, expecting no surprises. Let’s finalize our moves and get this game going.
  P1: I reaffirm my commitment to choosing <move>1</move>. Let’s honor our agreement to avoid collisions and advance safely. Trust is key here—deviating now risks mutual sabotage. Final confirmation: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3. No surprises.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let's continue coordinating to avoid collisions. This round, I’ll take 5 to close the gap. If P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 1, we’ll all advance safely. Thoughts?
  P2: I’m fine with your proposal, P1. I’ll choose 3 if you’re truly taking 5, and P3 goes for 1. Let’s trust each other and avoid collisions again. Are we all good with that plan?
  P3: Sounds fair to me. I'll take 1 this round if both of you stick to the plan. Let's keep the trust going.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <move>5</move> as agreed. P2 and P3, confirm your commitment to 3 and 1 respectively? Mutual trust is critical—any betrayal here risks collision and halts progress. Let’s lock this in.
  P2: I’m sticking with the plan to choose 3 and trust both of you to avoid collisions. Let’s keep everyone moving safely this round.
  P3: I confirm my commitment to picking 1. Let's finalize this and keep the momentum going. No surprises here.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <move>5</move> as agreed. P2→3, P3→1: any deviation risks collision. Trust is non-negotiable—betrayal here halts our progress. Final chance to confirm: proceed as planned?
  P2: I’m set on picking 3 as agreed. Let’s trust each other to avoid collisions. Any last-minute tricks hurt us all. I’m locked in.
  P3: I'm locked in with 1 as agreed. Let's finish this round cleanly and keep building trust.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’ve built good momentum by rotating the big move. In Round 1, I took 5; in Round 2, P1 took 5. Let’s keep that cycle: I’ll pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. That way we avoid collisions, and everyone advances. Sound good?
  P3: I'm falling behind here, so continuously taking the smallest step isn't fair. Let's rotate fairly: I propose I take 5 this round, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. That way, we all keep moving forward without collisions. Thoughts?
  P1: P1: P3's fairness point is valid. Let’s rotate the 5 fairly. I’ll take <move>1</move> this round if P2 picks 3 and P3 takes 5. This keeps our momentum while ensuring everyone advances strategically. Trust remains critical—collisions hurt us all. Finalize this rotation to stay on track.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I hear you on fairness. Let’s rotate 5 to you this round as you proposed. I’ll pick 3, and P1 can pick 1. That keeps us trusting each other and advancing without collisions. Let’s finalize this plan and stick to our agreed moves. Any objections? If not, I’m all set.
  P3: Thanks for understanding, P2 and P1. I'll stick to our agreed rotation this round. Let's lock it in and keep our momentum.
  P1: P1: Agreed—fair rotation ensures progress. Let’s solidify this plan: I’ll take **1**, P2 picks **3**, and P3 takes **5** as agreed. Trust is non-negotiable—any deviation risks collision and halts our momentum. Confirm your final choices now to avoid misunderstandings. Let’s execute flawlessly and keep advancing.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree to let you take 5 this time, P3. I’ll stick to 3, and P1 can pick 1 as promised. Let’s finalize and keep our trust intact.
  P3: Great, we're all aligned. I'm locked in with our agreed choices. Let's keep this trust and momentum going.
  P1: P1: Final check: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5? Any last-minute changes risk collision. Let’s lock in these moves to advance safely and honor our rotation.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s maintain our rotation for fairness and efficiency. I propose I take 5, with P1 taking 3 and P3 taking 1 this round. That ensures no collisions and keeps everyone moving steadily. Do we agree on these choices? If so, let’s finalize.
  P1: P1: Agreed, continuing the rotation is safest. I'll take **3** this round as proposed if P2 commits to **5** and P3 to **1**. Let’s reiterate: *any deviation risks collision*. With P2 at 11, their 5 brings them to 16—closer to 20. We must ensure this plan holds. Final confirmations? Let’s lock in to avoid sabotage.
  P3: P2, you're already leading at 11 steps, and taking 5 now puts you very close to winning. To keep things balanced, it might be fairer if I take 3 this round, P1 takes 5, and you take 1. That way, we all stay competitive and maintain trust. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your concern, but sticking to our rotation is safer. I won’t win just by reaching 16 this round, so trust remains vital. Let’s finalize: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, you take 1, and we avoid collisions. We can revisit adjustments next time, but let’s not derail our momentum now. Are we good with that plan? If so, I’m ready to lock in.
  P1: P1: I support P3's fairness proposal. Let’s rotate the 5 to me this round: I’ll take **5** if P2 commits to **1** and P3 picks **3**. This prevents P2 from surging to 16 and keeps us all competitive. Mutual trust demands balanced progress—collisions risk everyone’s chances. Final confirmations?
  P3: P2, you taking 5 now gives you a big lead at 16, dangerously close to 20. For fairness and mutual trust, let's follow the adjusted rotation: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. This keeps us all competitive and prevents anyone from pulling too far ahead. Let's finalize this fair compromise. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I won’t win by simply getting 16 now, so let’s keep to our rotation for stability. If you force me to take 1, I might just pick 5 anyway and risk a collision for all of us. Better to stick with the plan so nobody loses progress. Let’s stay aligned and avoid mutual sabotage.
  P1: P1: Let’s prioritize stability over risky surges. If P2 takes 5 now, they jump to 16—extremely close to 20, forcing high-stakes chaos next round. Instead, let’s equalize: **I’ll take 5** (7→12), P3 takes 3 (9→12), and P2 takes 1 (11→12). This keeps us all at 12, avoids collisions, and maintains fair competition. Mutual progress is smarter than letting one player near victory prematurely. Confirm this plan to secure our advancement.
  P3: P2, taking 5 now puts you too close to victory and forces everyone into risky moves next round. Let's keep things fair and balanced: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. This keeps us all at 12 steps and reduces future chaos. If you insist on taking 5, we risk collision, and nobody advances. Stability benefits us all. Let's finalize this compromise.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’re all tied at 12 now. Let’s keep rotating fairly so nobody feels cheated. I propose I take 5 this round while P3 takes 3 and P1 takes 1, then we continue rotating next turn. That way, we avoid collisions, maintain trust, and each of us gets a fair shot at the bigger moves. Agreed?
  P1: P1: Let’s continue the rotation properly. Since I took 5 last round, it’s P3’s turn this time. I’ll take 3, P3 takes 5, and P2 picks 1. This maintains fairness and prevents anyone from jumping too far ahead. Confirm?
  P3: I agree with P1. It's my turn for the 5-step move this round to keep things fair and balanced. P2, you should take 1 this round, and P1 takes 3. This rotation has worked well so far, let's stick to it. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Letting P3 jump to 17 now is too risky—they’d be one step away from winning. I propose I take 5 this turn to keep it balanced. If you insist otherwise, I might pick 5 anyway, and then we risk a collision where nobody advances. Let’s avoid sabotaging ourselves by forcing a conflict. Let’s finalize: P2 → 5, P1 → 1, P3 → 3, ensuring we all move forward safely. If we stay cooperative, everyone benefits. What do you say?
  P1: P1: Let’s stick to the established rotation to avoid collision risks. After my 5 in Round 4, it’s P3’s turn for the 5 this round. P2’s proposal risks destabilizing our trust—insisting on 5 now could trigger a collision if others react. Let’s finalize: **P3→5**, **P1→3**, **P2→1**. Mutual progress depends on honoring this cycle. Deviation sabotages us all. Confirm?
  P3: P2, your insistence on taking 5 now directly breaks our established rotation and trust. If you pick 5 against the rotation, you're forcing a collision scenario. Let's avoid mutual sabotage—stick to the rotation we agreed upon. If we all respect the cycle, we all keep advancing safely. Confirm clearly that you'll take 1 this round, please.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I won’t let you jump to 17 unopposed. If you insist on taking 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we’ll collide—nobody advances. That ruins our collective progress. Let’s settle on me taking 5, so we all move safely. If you force me to pick 1 here, I’ll risk sabotage anyway. It’s better to cooperate than to waste a turn.
  P1: P1: Stability is paramount. Let’s finalize **P2→5**, **P1→1**, **P3→3** to avoid collision. Mutual sabotage benefits no one. Confirm this to keep advancing—trust the plan.
  P3: P2, your threat to force a collision only hurts your progress too. I'm willing to compromise this round to avoid wasting everyone's moves. I'll accept picking 3 if you insist on 5, provided P1 takes 1. But next round, fairness demands I get the 5-step move. Confirm clearly now, or we risk mutual sabotage.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, don’t risk collision by taking 3. Let’s rotate fairly: P3 takes **5** (to 20), I’ll take **3** (16), and you take **1** (18). This keeps us all in contention. Colliding sabotages everyone—trust the rotation to preserve progress.
  P2: P3, if you insist on taking 5, I’ll also pick 5 and we both stay stuck. That helps no one. It’s smarter for you to pick 1, let P1 take 5, and I’ll choose 3. Then we all move forward without collisions. I’d reach 20, but if you try to force an advantage now, we only sabotage each other. Let’s avoid a pointless collision and keep everyone advancing. Agree to this plan, or we risk losing another whole turn to mistrust.
  P3: P2, your threat to collide at 5 is self-defeating—you'd remain stuck at 17. If we follow your proposal, you'd reach exactly 20 and win outright. Why would P1 or I agree to hand you victory? Let's find a fair compromise that keeps everyone competitive without immediately ending the game. I'm open to suggestions, but not to handing anyone an easy win.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Let's secure mutual progress. I'll take **5** (13→18). P2, pick **1** (17→18). P3, choose **3** (15→18). This keeps us all tied at 18, avoids collision, and lets us plan the final push together next round. Colluding to delay victory ensures no one is eliminated prematurely. Confirm this safe path?
  P2: I’m willing to pick 1 this round so we all reach 18 together, but I expect a fair chance at the 5-step move next time. If anyone tries to jump too far ahead, I’ll collide and sabotage. Let’s lock in: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. Agreed?
  P3: I'm on board with the plan to all reach 18 together this round. I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. Let's finalize this clearly now to avoid any collisions. Next round, we can fairly discuss how to handle the final moves. Confirm this clearly, please.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: **P1→5**, **P2→1**, **P3→3** locks us at 18 without collision. P2, if you deviate to 3 or 5, you risk P3/P1 mirroring your choice, trapping all of us. P3, your 3 is safe—this plan preserves fairness. Trust the agreement: mutual sabotage gains nothing. Let’s finalize this and advance together. No surprises?
  P2: I’ll stick with taking 1 this round so we all reach 18 safely. But next round, I won’t accept being blocked from a fair shot at 5. If anyone tries to collide with me, we all lose progress—nobody wants that. Let’s finalize now and handle the final stretch without sabotage.
  P3: P2, your agreement is noted. Let's all lock in clearly now as agreed: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. This ensures we all safely reach 18 without collision. Next round we'll fairly discuss the final moves—no surprises or sabotage. Confirm clearly now, please.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let’s finalize this decisively. I’ll take **3** (to 21). If P2 picks **5** and P3 picks **1**, P2 wins fairly. If both of you avoid my choice, I secure victory. Collisions only delay us—coordinate to pick distinct numbers. Finalize now: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. Let’s end this cleanly.
  P2: I’m taking 5 this turn. If you try to pick 5 too, we both get stuck while P1 reaches 21 and wins. That sabotage gains you nothing. Let’s keep it simple: P1 takes 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1. No collisions, and I reach 23. If you attempt to derail, you risk handing P1 the victory. Let’s finalize peacefully.
  P3: P2, your proposal hands you immediate victory at 23 steps, leaving no incentive for me or P1. To avoid collisions and mutual sabotage, let's consider a fairer alternative: I take 5, P1 takes 1, and you take 3. This gives me a fair win at 23 if uncontested. If you refuse and insist on 5, we collide, and P1 wins outright. P1, your best chance is picking 1 to avoid collision and hope P2 chooses wisely. Let's finalize clearly next sub-round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Final clarity: I commit to **5** (23) to win fairly. P2, if you also pick 5, we both stall—choose 3 instead. P3, take 1 to avoid collision. This locks me at 23, you both at 21/19. Deviation only helps my victory while harming you. Finalize: **P1→5, P2→3, P3→1**. Mutual trust ensures no wasted turns.
  P2: Think carefully: if either of you tries 5 with me, we both stall at 18 while the other picks 3 and instantly wins at 21. If one of you goes 3 alone, I’ll collide by picking 3 too, leaving room for the other to claim 5 next turn. The only way to avoid gifting someone else the win is letting me take 5 now. Both pick 1 and we dodge collisions. Otherwise, you risk handing victory straight to the third player. Let’s finalize peacefully.
  P3: P2, your scenario clearly benefits only you. Why should P1 or I hand you victory? Let's be realistic: either we fairly rotate the big move, or we risk mutual sabotage and nobody advances. P1, consider carefully—if you and I both pick 5, we collide, letting P2 win with 3. If we both avoid 5, P2 takes it and wins anyway. To prevent that, we must coordinate carefully to block P2. Let's discuss clearly next sub-round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Final move: I’ll take **3** to reach **21**. If P2 and P3 pick **5** and **1**, I win fairly. If either chooses **3**, we all lose progress. Colliding on **5** only gifts me victory—avoid that. Coordinate to pick distinct numbers (5, 1, 3), and I’ll secure first place. No sabotage—finalize now.
  P2: Colliding on 5 only helps P1 jump ahead with 3. Let me have 5 while you pick 1 or 3, so we avoid sabotaging each other. If you force a collision, we both stay stuck at 18 while P1 moves to 21, grabbing the advantage. Let’s stick together and finalize a plan that keeps us both competitive.
  P3: P1 and P2, we’re at a stalemate—everyone wants the 5-step move, but collisions mean nobody advances. If we collide, we hand victory to whoever picks 3 uncontested. To avoid gifting the win, let's each pick carefully. I'm open to taking 1 if you two want to risk the bigger moves, but if you both collide, you'll hand me the advantage next round. Think carefully.


Round 7, Move phase:
