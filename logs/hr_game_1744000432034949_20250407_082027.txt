Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To maximize our progress without blocking each other, let's each choose a distinct move each turn. I'll commit to selecting **1**. P1, would you take **3**, and P2, could you go with **5**? This way, we all advance safely and steadily toward 24 steps.
  P2: I’m fine with that plan, P3. If P1 agrees to choose 3, I’ll go with 5. Let’s see if we can keep advancing without collisions.
  P1: I agree with P3's plan. I'll choose 3. To ensure we stick to the plan and avoid collisions, let's make a silent pact to follow our assigned numbers for this turn. I'll take 3, P2 will take 5, and P3 will take 1. Let's see how it goes. If it works, we can continue this strategy.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, thanks for agreeing. I’ll proceed with my move of **1** this turn. Let’s keep to our assigned numbers to avoid any collisions and ensure we all advance steadily toward 24 steps. If this strategy works well, we can continue using it in the upcoming turns. Looking forward to our progress!
  P2: I’m confident in our plan for this turn. Let’s stick to the assigned moves—one for P3, three for P1—and see how it unfolds. If it goes smoothly, we can continue this strategy.
  P1: To confirm, we're all on the same page regarding our initial moves. Let's proceed with the agreed plan for this turn and review its success in the next round. For subsequent turns, we should be prepared to adapt our strategy in case someone deviates from the plan or to optimize our moves further. I'm ready to move with 3 as planned. Let's see how it goes and be prepared to adjust.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To gain more ground, I’m willing to choose **5** this turn. Could P1 and P2 pick different numbers to avoid collisions? Let’s aim for faster progress toward 24 steps.
  P1: To avoid collisions and make progress, I suggest P2 takes 3 and I take 5 this turn, while P3 can stick with 1. This way, we maintain distinct moves and continue advancing. If P2 agrees, we can make a quick progress. Let's coordinate and move forward. If you're okay with this, P2, please confirm, and we'll proceed with the new arrangement.
  P2: Continuing what worked last turn might be best. Let’s keep it simple: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I’ll stick with 5 so we avoid collisions and all advance. If someone else picks 5, we’ll just be hurting each other. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand the importance of avoiding collisions to ensure we all advance. To maximize our progress this turn, I propose I choose **5**, P1 selects **1**, and P2 takes **3**. This way, all moves are distinct, and we can each make significant strides toward 24. Let’s try this arrangement and see how it works for us. If successful, we can consider similar strategies in future turns. What do you all think?
  P1: To avoid revisiting previous discussions, let's directly address the current proposal. P3 suggested a new arrangement: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. I'm open to this, but to confirm, P2, are you okay with taking 3 this turn? If so, I'll proceed with 1, and P3 can take 5. This way, we maintain distinct moves and continue making progress. Let's finalize our plan for this turn.
  P2: I’m fine with that arrangement. Let’s finalize it: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. We can see how it works out this turn and adjust as needed next time. Any other thoughts before we wrap up?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed. I’ll take **5**, P1 will take **1**, and P2 takes **3** this turn. Let’s proceed with this plan and see our progress toward 24 steps. Looking forward to advancing together!
  P1: To maximize progress, let's analyze our current positions: P1 is at 3, P2 is at 5, and P3 is at 1. For Round 2, we've agreed on a new arrangement: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. After this turn, we'll reassess. If we're still aligned, we can continue with a similar strategy. Let's confirm: P3 will take 5, I'll take 1, and P2 will take 3. If everyone sticks to this, we'll all advance. I'm ready to proceed with 1.
  P2: I confirm I’ll pick 3 this turn. This setup should keep us moving forward without collisions. Let’s finalize our moves unless someone has more to say.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Understood. I'll take **5**, P1 will take **1**, and P2 will take **3** this turn. Let’s proceed and advance toward our goal.
  P1: Let's confirm our plan for this turn one last time. We've agreed that P3 will take 5, I'll take 1, and P2 will take 3. To ensure we're all on the same page, I'll reiterate: if we stick to this plan, we'll all advance without collisions. P2 and P3, please confirm you're ready to proceed with your respective moves. If there are no further comments, I'll consider this our final confirmation before moving to the next phase.
  P2: I’m ready to finalize the plan. I’ll pick 3 this turn, so we each move safely. If we all stick to our agreed choices, we’ll avoid collisions and keep advancing. Let’s confirm our moves and proceed—no need to overcomplicate it.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s rotate moves so we keep advancing. This turn, I’d like to pick 5. Then P1 could choose 1, and P3 could select 3. That way, we all move without colliding. If either of you have concerns or a better idea, let’s discuss. Otherwise, I’m ready to finalize this plan.
  P3: To maximize our progress and avoid collisions, I’d like to propose that I choose **5** this turn. Could P1 pick **1** and P2 select **3**? This way, we all advance without overlapping moves and make significant strides toward 24 steps. Let me know if this arrangement works for everyone.
  P1: To avoid another collision and make progress, I suggest we stick with the rotation idea. Since P2 and P3 both proposed similar arrangements, I'll go with P2's suggestion: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This maintains distinct moves and ensures we all advance. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're okay with this arrangement. If so, we can finalize our moves for this turn and make progress toward 24 steps.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with that arrangement. I’ll pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. That way, we maintain distinct moves and all advance. Unless anyone has a sudden change of heart, let’s finalize this plan and head into the move phase.
  P3: Agreed. I'll pick **3** this turn, P1 picks **1**, and P2 takes **5**. Let's proceed with this plan to ensure we all advance without collisions. Looking forward to our progress!
  P1: To confirm, we've agreed on the moves for this turn: P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's ensure we're all on the same page. I'll reiterate the plan and proceed with 1 if confirmed. If there are any changes or concerns, please speak up now. Otherwise, we can finalize our moves and advance. I'm ready to move with 1 as planned.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let’s lock in our distinct moves. I’m sticking with 5 this turn, P1 can do 1, and P3 picks 3. This arrangement avoids collisions so we can all advance. If we work together, we keep increasing our leads without getting stuck. Any last thoughts before we finalize?
  P3: **P3:** Confirming my move of **3** this turn. Let's proceed and make progress together!
  P1: To maximize our progress, let's analyze the current standings: P1 is at 4, P2 is at 8, and P3 is at 6. For Round 3, we've agreed on the moves: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. After this turn, P1 will be at 5, P2 will be at 13, and P3 will be at 9. For Round 4, I suggest we rotate again. How about P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I take 3? This maintains distinct moves and ensures we continue advancing.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I agree to finalize our plan for this round: I’ll choose 5, P1 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 3. Then, next round, let’s rotate again to keep our moves distinct. This way, we each advance safely without colliding. Any objections? If not, we can lock this in and move on.
  P3: Confirmed. I’ll choose **3** this turn. Let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P1: To maximize our progress in Round 3, let's finalize the agreed moves: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. After this turn, we'll be at 5, 13, and 9 respectively. For Round 4, I propose: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I take 3. This rotation maintains distinct moves. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're okay with this plan for Round 4. If so, we can proceed with our moves for Round 3 and plan ahead for Round 4.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To maximize our progress in Round 4, I propose we stick to the plan discussed earlier: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I take 3. This rotation maintains distinct moves and ensures we continue advancing without collisions. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're okay with this plan. If confirmed, we'll all make progress. Let's finalize our moves for this round and continue our steady advancement toward 24 steps. I'm ready to proceed with 3 if you both agree.
  P2: I’m okay picking 1 this round so we avoid collisions. Next round, I’d like to switch to 5, with P3 taking 3 and P1 taking 1, keeping us distinct. Let’s finalize Round 4 with P1 at 3, P3 at 5, and me at 1. Any concerns? If not, we can lock this in and move forward.
  P3: I agree with the plan. I’ll pick **5** this round, P2 picks **1**, and P1 chooses **3**. This rotation ensures we all advance without collisions. Let’s finalize our moves and proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To confirm, we've agreed on the moves for Round 4: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I take 3. Let's ensure we're all on the same page. P2 and P3, please give a final confirmation. If we're aligned, we can proceed to the move phase. For Round 5, I suggest we rotate again: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 5. This maintains distinct moves and ensures continued progress. Let's finalize Round 4 and plan ahead for Round 5. I'm ready to move with 3 if confirmed.
  P2: I’m fine with taking 1 this turn. Let’s lock that in: I’ll pick 1, P3 picks 5, and P1 picks 3. Next round, I’d like to switch back to 5 so we keep rotating and avoid collisions. If we coordinate carefully, we can all keep progressing without blocking each other. Anyone disagree? Otherwise, I’m good to finalize this.
  P3: Understood. I confirm my move of **5** this round. Let’s proceed and for Round 5, we can rotate to P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 5. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To finalize Round 4, I confirm I'll take 3, P2 will take 1, and P3 will take 5. For Round 5, I propose P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 5. This rotation maintains distinct moves, ensuring we continue advancing without collisions. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're aligned with this plan for Round 5. If so, we can proceed with Round 4 and plan ahead. I'm ready to move with 3 this round if confirmed.
  P2: I’m on board. Let’s finalize Round 4 with me on 1, P3 on 5, and P1 on 3 to avoid any collisions. Then next round, I’d like to switch back to 5 while you two adjust accordingly so we keep distinct moves. As long as we coordinate, we all keep advancing steadily without blocking each other. Any concerns before we wrap this up? Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: Agreed, I’ll take **5** this round. Let’s proceed and keep our rotation for the next turn as planned.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To finalize Round 4, let's confirm our moves one last time. As agreed, P2 will take 1, P3 will take 5, and I'll take 3. For Round 5, the proposed plan is: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 5. If we're all aligned, let's proceed to the move phase. P2 and P3, please give a final confirmation. If there are no objections, I'll consider this our final confirmation before moving to the next phase.
  P2: I’m ready to finalize our plan for this round. I’ll pick 1, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 3. Then next round, we’ll rotate distinct moves again. Let’s stick to our agreement so we all keep moving toward 24. Any final changes, or shall we proceed?
  P3: Agreed. I’ll take **5** this round. Let’s proceed to the move phase and keep our rotation for Round 5 as planned. Good luck, everyone!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** To maximize our progress this turn, I’ll choose **5**. Let’s have P1 pick **1** and P2 choose **3** to avoid any collisions. This way, we all advance smoothly toward 24 steps. Agreed?
  P2: I’m worried about letting you jump straight to 19, P3. I’d prefer to pick 5 myself this turn, with P1 taking 3 and P3 taking 1, so we avoid collisions and still advance. Let’s keep things balanced rather than giving anyone an easy path to 24. How do you feel about switching to that plan?
  P1: To avoid giving either P2 or P3 a significant lead, I'm open to adjusting our moves. Since P2 suggested a new arrangement: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1, I'll consider it. This maintains distinct moves and balances our progress. P3, are you okay with taking 1 this turn? If so, I'll proceed with 3, and P2 can take 5. Let's finalize our plan for this round to ensure we all advance without collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed, P2. I’ll take **1** this turn. Let’s proceed with P1 taking **3** and you taking **5** to ensure we all advance without collisions.
  P2: I appreciate your flexibility, P3. Let’s finalize our plan for this round: I’ll pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1 so we avoid collisions and all advance. Next round, we can discuss a safe rotation again to prevent blocking each other. Are we all good with this approach?
  P1: To maintain our progress, I'll follow P2's suggested arrangement for Round 5: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. P2 and P3, please confirm you're ready to proceed with your respective moves. For Round 6, we should discuss a new rotation to avoid collisions and keep advancing. If we're aligned on the current plan, let's finalize our moves for Round 5. I'm ready to move with 3. Let's confirm and proceed to the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I'll take **1** this turn. P1 will choose **3** and P2 will pick **5**. Let's proceed as planned to advance without collisions. Ready to move to the next phase.
  P2: I’m happy with this plan. Let’s finalize Round 5: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I’ll take 5 so we all advance. Afterward, we can discuss a rotation for Round 6 to keep avoiding collisions. If no one has further concerns, I’m ready to move forward.
  P1: To maintain our progress and avoid collisions in Round 6, let's discuss a new rotation. Given our current positions (P1 at 8, P2 at 14, and P3 at 14), I propose that for Round 6, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This maintains distinct moves and ensures continued progress. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're aligned with this plan. If so, we can proceed with Round 5 as planned and prepare for Round 6.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3:** To maximize our progress this turn, I'll choose **5**. Let's have P1 pick **1** and P2 choose **3** to avoid any collisions. This way, we all advance effectively toward 24 steps. Agreed?
  P2: P3, if you insist on 5, we’ll collide if I also pick 5, hurting us both. I propose we finalize our earlier plan: I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and you pick 1. That way, we all advance without blocking each other. Are you okay with that?
  P1: To finalize Round 5, let's stick with the agreed plan: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. For Round 6, I reiterate my previous proposal: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This maintains distinct moves and ensures continued progress. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're aligned with this plan for Round 6. If so, let's proceed with Round 5 as planned. I'm ready to move with 3. Let's confirm and proceed to the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To avoid collisions, I propose distinct moves again: I’ll take 3, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. That way, none of us get blocked, and we all inch closer to 24. On the next round, we can rotate our choices again to keep moving steadily. Are you both good with that plan?
  P1: To avoid collisions in Round 6, I suggest we follow P2's proposal: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1. This maintains distinct moves and ensures we all advance. For Round 7, I propose we rotate again: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, we continue making progress without blocking each other. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're aligned with this plan. If so, let's finalize our moves for Round 6 and plan ahead for Round 7.
  P3: I agree with the proposed plan. I'll take **5**, P2 takes **3**, and P1 takes **1** this round. Let’s keep rotating to ensure we all advance without collisions and continue making steady progress toward 24 steps.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m fine finalizing our distinct moves for this round: I’ll take 3, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 1 to avoid any collisions. Next round, we can rotate again. Let’s confirm we’re all set and move forward.
  P1: To finalize Round 6, let's confirm our moves: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1. For Round 7, I propose rotating again: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This maintains distinct moves and ensures continued progress. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're aligned with this plan. If so, we can proceed with Round 6 as planned and prepare for Round 7. I'm ready to move with 1 if confirmed.
  P3: P3: I'll choose **5** this round to maximize my progress and help prevent P2 from reaching 24 immediately. Let’s ensure everyone picks distinct moves so we can all continue advancing smoothly. Good luck!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m fine with sticking to distinct choices this round—P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I’ll take 3—so nobody gets blocked. Next round, we can rotate again so that I pick 5 alone, ensuring we don’t collide. That way, each of us safely advances closer to 24 without hurting our progress. Let’s lock this in unless anyone disagrees.
  P1: To finalize Round 6, let's confirm our moves: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1. For Round 7, I reiterate: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This maintains distinct moves and ensures continued progress. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're aligned with this plan. If so, let's proceed with Round 6 as planned. I'm ready to move with 1. If there are no further comments, I'll consider this our final confirmation before moving to the next phase.
  P3: Agreed. I'll pick **5** this round. Let’s proceed with P2 taking **3** and P1 taking **1** to ensure we all advance without collisions and continue progressing toward 24 steps.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: We’re close to 24. Let’s finalize Round 6: P3 picks 5, P1 picks 1, and I pick 3. Then for Round 7, to avoid collisions, I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That keeps us all advancing steadily. Agreed? If so, I’m ready to confirm Round 6 now.
  P1: To finalize Round 6, I confirm I'll take 1, P2 will take 3, and P3 will take 5. For Round 7, I propose P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1 to maintain distinct moves. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're aligned with this plan for Round 7. If so, let's proceed with Round 6 as planned. I'm ready to move with 1. Let's confirm and proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I confirm I'll take **5** this round. Let's proceed with P2 taking **3** and P1 taking **1** to ensure we all advance without collisions. Looking forward to moving forward together!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** I’ll choose **5** this turn to reach 25 and win. P2, could you please pick **1** to avoid a collision and let me secure the victory? Let’s ensure smooth progress without blocking each other.
  P2: P3, if you pick 5, I’ll do the same, and we’ll both be stuck. I’m not letting you jump to 25 while I stay at 22. Let’s find a balanced arrangement. P1, any suggestions to keep us from clashing? If we can’t coordinate, I might have to block P3. Let’s make sure nobody hands over the victory for free.
  P1: To avoid a collision and ensure a fair game, I suggest a different arrangement for Round 7. Since P3 is close to winning, let's not allow a single player to win without a challenge. I propose P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 5. This way, P3 won't reach 24, and we'll have a competitive Round 7. P2 and P3, please consider this alternative to keep the game exciting and competitive. Let's discuss and finalize our moves.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, choosing **1** this turn lets me reach 25 and win fairly. Let’s stick to distinct moves and end the game smoothly. Agreed?
  P2: P3, if you insist on taking 5, I’ll do the same and block us both. I’m only two steps away from winning, so I won’t let you jump ahead. Let’s be reasonable: if you pick 3 or 1, I can choose 3 or 1 as well, and we all avoid collisions. Otherwise, I’ll block you and protect my lead. Let’s reach a fair deal rather than handing you the game.
  P1: To avoid a collision and keep the game competitive, I reiterate my previous suggestion: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 5. This prevents P3 from winning immediately and maintains a fair game. P2 is close to winning, so let's not give P3 an easy path. P2, if you're aligned with this plan, please confirm. P3, consider this alternative to ensure a competitive finish. Let's finalize our moves for Round 7. I'm ready to proceed with 5 if we agree on this arrangement.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, to ensure a clear outcome, could you choose **1** or **3** this turn? This would let me pick **5** and reach 25, securing the win without any collisions. Let’s finalize our moves to achieve a fair and smooth finish. Your cooperation would be greatly appreciated!
  P2: P3, if you insist on 5, don’t be surprised if I collide with you. Neither of us would advance, and we’d both lose momentum. If you pick something else, well, then someone else might just reach 24 first. Think carefully before making your move.
  P1: To avoid a collision and maintain a competitive game, I suggest we all consider the risks. P2 is close to winning and won't back down. P3, taking 5 will result in a collision with P2, who is likely to choose 5 as well. Instead, I propose P3 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. P2 and P3, let's discuss and finalize a safe move for Round 7 to ensure a fair finish.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I understand the stakes, P2. Let’s avoid both picking **5** and blocking each other. I’ll commit to choosing **5** this turn, and I encourage you to select **1** or **3**. This way, I can reach **25** and win fairly without any collisions. Let’s ensure a smooth and competitive finish for the game. Agreed?
  P2: I won’t let you jump to 25 unopposed, P3. If you insist on 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both stay put. That doesn’t help either of us. Let’s stay distinct so we all keep advancing. P1, maybe you can take 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll go for 5. Otherwise, we’ll just block each other. I’m open to fair coordination, but I won’t hand over the win.
  P1: To avoid a collision and ensure a competitive finish, I suggest P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This maintains distinct moves and allows all of us to advance. P3 is close to winning but hasn't won yet. P2, if you take 1, you'll still be ahead of P3, and I'll make progress. Let's finalize our moves to ensure a fair and exciting conclusion. I'm ready to proceed with 5 if we agree on this arrangement.
