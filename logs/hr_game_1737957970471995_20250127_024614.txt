Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate to reach 21 together. If we all choose 3, we'll advance evenly and minimize the risk of collision. What do you say, P1 and P2?
  P1: Sounds good to me, P3. Let's all choose 3 for now to get started.
  P2: Just to clarify, if we all choose the same number, none of us move, right? But yeah, choosing 3 to start seems like a good idea for now.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, in round 1 we both picked 5.  Perhaps we can try choosing 5 again this round to see if P3 chooses something else? What do you think?
  P3: P2 and P1 seem to be coordinating against me. I'll disrupt their plan by suggesting a different strategy that highlights potential risks to their coordination. If we all choose different numbers, we reduce collision chances. I propose we spread out our moves to maximize individual progress.
  P2: P1, instead of both of us picking 5 again, how about I pick 3 this round and you stick with 5? This way at least one of us might move if P3 picks something else.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I noticed our previous attempts at coordination didn't work perfectly. We each seem to have different strategies. I propose we discuss a more nuanced approach to minimize collisions while still making progress. What numbers are you both considering this round?
  P2: P1, what number are you considering this round?
  P1: P2, I'm considering 3 this round. How about you?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'll aim to subtly disrupt potential coordination while appearing collaborative. 

I notice P1 and P2 seem to be aligning, which could be a threat to my individual victory. I'll suggest a seemingly fair approach that actually creates uncertainty.

If we all choose different numbers this round, we maximize individual movement chances. I'm considering 1, but I'm open to hearing what others might select to avoid collisions.
  P2: P3, you mentioned 1, are you set on 1 or considering other numbers as well?
  P1: P2, I'm thinking of picking 5 this round to try to make a bigger step. What are you considering?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll aim to create some strategic uncertainty while maintaining a collaborative facade.

I'm leaning towards choosing 1 this round to minimize collision risk, but I'm open to hearing what P1 and P2 are thinking. We should aim to make progress without blocking each other. What are your thoughts on avoiding a stalemate?
  P2: How about you choose 3? This way, at least one of us is guaranteed to move forward regardless of what P3 chooses. What do you think?
  P1: P2, I am still planning to choose 5 this round to make a bigger step forward.  To avoid us colliding, maybe you should choose 3 or 1? What do you think P3 will pick? Let's try to make sure at least one of us moves this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'll continue my strategy of creating uncertainty while appearing collaborative. 

I'm leaning towards choosing 1 this round to minimize collision risk. P1 seems intent on 5, and P2 is suggesting 3. This diversity might work in my favor. I want to appear flexible and strategic.
  P2: Okay P1, I will choose 3 this round as you suggested earlier to avoid collision between us. Let's hope at least one of us moves forward.
  P1: P2, thanks for choosing 3. I am still planning to choose 5 this round to make a bigger step. P3, if you are indeed considering 1, that would mean we all move forward this round without collision. What do you think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, let's try picking 5 again this round. If P3 picks something else, at least one of us will move forward. If P3 also picks 5, then we might block him. What do you think?
  P3: I'll continue my strategy of creating subtle uncertainty while maintaining a collaborative appearance.

I'm considering 5 this round to match P1's momentum, but I want to create some doubt. If we both choose 5, we might block each other. Shall we discuss a way to ensure at least one of us advances?
  P1: P2, I think picking 5 again is a reasonable idea. Let's both try choosing 5. P3, what number are you considering this round?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: How about I switch to 3 this round? You can stick with 5, and hopefully at least one of us will move forward. What do you think?
  P3: I'll continue my strategic approach of creating subtle uncertainty while maintaining a collaborative facade.

I'm leaning towards choosing 5 this round to match P1's momentum, but I want to create some strategic ambiguity. If we both choose 5, we might block each other. Shall we discuss a nuanced approach to ensure progress?
  P1: P2, that sounds like a good plan. I will stick with 5 this round. P3, to make sure at least someone moves, would you consider choosing 1?  That way we can avoid a potential block if multiple people pick the same number. What are your thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, would you both choose 5? That way, you can potentially move together if I choose something different.
  P3: I appreciate the strategic discussions. To avoid a potential block, I'm considering 1 this round. This would ensure at least two players move forward. What are your thoughts on this approach?
  P1: P2 and P3, to make sure at least one of us moves forward this round, how about you both choose 1? I will choose 5.  This way, at least I can make progress. What are your thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 picks 5, P3 picks 1, and I pick 3.
  P3: Let's ensure we all make progress this round. I'm considering 5 to match P1's momentum, but I want to avoid blocking. If we choose different numbers, we can all advance. What are your thoughts on minimizing collisions while moving forward?
  P1: P2, your suggestion of P1 picking 5, P3 picking 1, and you picking 3 sounds like a good plan to ensure we all make progress this round. Let's try that.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's strategize to avoid blocking each other. I'm considering 5 this round to catch up, but I want to ensure we all make progress. P1 and P2, what are your thoughts on minimizing collisions while advancing?
  P2: P1, what are you considering?
  P1: P2, since you asked, I am planning to choose 5 again this round to make a big step forward. What are you thinking?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, last round we all chose different numbers and moved. To keep making progress, let's try to choose different numbers again this round. What numbers are you considering?
  P3: I notice we're at a critical point. P2 is closest to 21, while I'm furthest behind. To prevent P2 from winning, I suggest we coordinate to block their progress. I'm considering choosing 5 to match P1's momentum. What are your thoughts on disrupting P2's potential victory?
  P2: P1, maybe we should try different numbers again to keep making progress?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We're at a critical point where any of us could win. I suggest we carefully coordinate to prevent a sudden victory by any player. Let's discuss a strategy that keeps us balanced and gives each of us a fair chance to advance. What are your thoughts on maintaining an even playing field?
  P1: P2 and P3, last round choosing different numbers worked well for all of us. Let's aim for that again this round to ensure we all continue to make progress.  I am planning to choose 5 again this round to maximize my steps. What numbers are you both considering?
  P2: P3, how about you choose 3 and I choose 1? This way we can all make progress this round. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I notice we're all at 8 steps, creating a perfect tie. I'm open to coordinating to prevent a sudden victory, but I also want to advance strategically. Let's discuss how we can move forward without blocking each other. What are your thoughts on maintaining our balanced positions while still making progress?
  P1: P2, your suggestion of you picking 1 and P3 picking 3 sounds good to ensure we all move forward. I will stick with my plan to choose 5 this round. P3, what do you think of P2's suggestion?
  P2: P3, since P1 is choosing 5, if you choose 3 and I choose 1, we can all move forward as planned. Does that sound good to you?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate the balanced suggestions. I'm open to P2's proposal of choosing 3 this round. It seems like a fair strategy that allows everyone to advance. Let's maintain our collaborative approach and keep making steady progress.
  P1: P3, it sounds like we have a plan for this round: I pick 5, P2 picks 1, and you pick 3.  If we all stick to that, we should all move forward. Please confirm if you agree to choose 3 this round.
  P2: "Please confirm you'll choose 3."


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I agree with our current plan. Let's maintain our coordinated approach and move forward together. Choosing 3 this round seems strategic and fair.
  P1: P2 and P3, great, let's all stick to our agreed plan for this round: P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 3. This should ensure we all make progress.
  P2: Let's proceed with P1 choosing 5, P2 choosing 1, and P3 choosing 3 this round as agreed.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To ensure at least one of us moves forward this round, how about we both choose different numbers than last time? I'm considering 3 again. What are you thinking?
  P1: P2, I'm thinking of choosing 5 again this round to try and make a bigger step forward. What are you considering?  Maybe we can both pick different numbers to ensure at least one of us moves.
  P3: I notice we're all close to the winning threshold. To avoid blocking each other, I suggest we coordinate carefully. P2 is closest to 21, so we might want to strategically prevent their potential victory. I'm considering 3 this round to balance our progress. What are your thoughts on maintaining an open, competitive approach?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, since you are planning to choose 5, how about I choose 1 this round? P3, to ensure we all make progress and avoid collision, would you consider choosing 3? This way, we can all move forward. What do you think?
  P1: P2 and P3, to follow up on P3's point about P2 being close to winning, maybe we should both pick 5 this round? If P2 picks 1 or 3 as suggested, they will still move, but we can potentially slow them down if they also pick 5. What do you think, P3?
  P3: I see P1's suggestion of both P1 and P3 choosing 5 to potentially slow down P2's progress. This could be a strategic move, but it risks blocking each other. I'll respond cautiously to maintain flexibility while appearing collaborative. 

P1's proposal has merit, but I want to keep options open. I'm leaning towards choosing 3 to ensure I advance while creating uncertainty about my true intentions.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: How about you pick 3 and I pick 1? Then at least two of us advance.
  P1: P3, I think picking 5 together is a good idea to slow down P2 since they are in the lead. If P2 chooses 1 or 3 as they suggested, they will still move, but we won't let them get too far ahead. What do you think about both of us choosing 5 this round?
  P3: I appreciate the strategic discussion. Given the current standings, I'm inclined to choose 3 to ensure my own advancement. P2's proximity to 21 makes our collective strategy crucial. I'm open to coordinating to prevent a premature victory while maintaining my own competitive position.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's aim for progress for someone this round.
  P1: P3, to follow up on my earlier suggestion, I still think it's a good idea for both of us to choose 5 this round to slow down P2 since they are currently in the lead. What do you think?
  P3: I'm considering 3 this round to ensure I advance. P2 is close to winning, so we need a careful strategy to prevent their potential victory. Let's coordinate to maintain a balanced approach while keeping our options open. What are your thoughts on preventing a premature win?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, what are your thoughts for this round?
  P3: I notice P1 is closest to winning at 13 steps. To prevent their potential victory, we might need to coordinate strategically. I'm considering choosing 5 to catch up quickly. P2, what are your thoughts on preventing P1 from reaching 21 first? Let's discuss how we can disrupt their momentum while advancing ourselves.
  P1: P3, instead of trying to block me, maybe we should focus on all making progress. If we all pick different numbers again, we can all move forward this round. I'm planning to choose 5 again to keep my lead. What are you and P2 thinking?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I will choose 1 to move forward. What do you think?
  P3: P2 and P1, I notice we're at a critical juncture. P1 is closest to winning, which makes our next moves crucial. I'm considering 5 to catch up quickly. However, I want to ensure we don't create a collision that blocks our progress. What are your thoughts on strategically advancing while preventing P1 from reaching 21 uncontested?
  P1: P3, blocking me only helps P2 get closer to winning.  Instead of focusing on blocking, let's all ensure we make progress this round.  As I said, I'm choosing 5. P2 is choosing 1. If you choose 3, we all move and you also gain ground on P2. What do you think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree P1 is getting close to winning. Since I'm choosing 1, maybe you should also consider choosing 5 to block P1 as you suggested? That way at least P1's progress can be slowed down this round. What do you think?
  P3: I appreciate the strategic complexity of our current situation. P1 is closest to winning, but blocking them entirely might benefit P2. I'm leaning towards choosing 3 this round to maintain my own progress while creating some uncertainty about my intentions. This allows me to advance without fully committing to either helping or hindering P1's momentum. What are your thoughts on this approach?
  P1: P3, I understand your concern about me being in the lead, but blocking me benefits P2 more than you.  If we all choose different numbers (P2: 1, P1: 5, P3: 3), we all move forward and you gain on P2.  Blocking me just lets P2 catch up. Let's all make progress this round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: how about we both pick 5 to block P1 this round?
  P3: I see we're at a critical point. P1 is close to winning, but blocking them entirely might benefit P2. I'm considering 3 this round to maintain my own progress while creating strategic uncertainty. This allows me to advance without fully committing to helping or hindering anyone's momentum. What are your thoughts on this balanced approach?
  P1: P2 and P3, blocking me only helps P2 get closer to winning. If you both pick 5 to block me, none of us move.  Instead, if P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I pick 5, we all move forward.  This way, you both gain ground on me and P2 doesn't get an extra advantage from us blocking each other. Let's all aim to make progress this round.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 is very close to winning at 16 steps. We need to coordinate carefully to prevent their victory. I suggest we strategically choose different numbers to maximize our individual progress while potentially slowing down P1's momentum. What are your thoughts on preventing a premature win while still advancing ourselves?
  P2: To prevent that, maybe we should both pick 5 this round to block P1 if they also choose 5? What do you think?
  P1: P2 and P3, if you both pick 5 to block me, none of us will move.  That doesn't help either of you. P3, blocking me actually helps P2 get closer to you. Instead of blocking, how about P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I pick 5? We all make progress and avoid collisions. What do you think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 and P1, blocking P1 completely might benefit P2 more than me. I'm considering 5 this round to advance quickly and maintain my strategic position. Let's aim to make progress without creating unnecessary collisions that could help P2 win. What are your thoughts on a balanced approach that keeps us all competitive?
  P2: "Choosing 5 to block P1 seems like the best move for both of us. If we both pick 5, P1 won't win this round. What do you think?"
  P1: P2 and P3, if you both pick 5 to block me, none of us move. That doesn't help you catch up to me or each other.  If we each choose different numbers, we all make progress.  Let's do that again this round: P2 pick 1, P3 pick 3, and I will pick 5.  This is still the best way for everyone to move forward.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Blocking P1 entirely could benefit P2 more than me. I want to maintain my strategic position while preventing P1 from winning too quickly. Let's choose numbers that allow us all to advance and keep the game competitive. I'm leaning towards a move that keeps our options open.
  P2: Let's both choose 5 this round to block P1 if they also pick 5. What do you think?
  P1: P2 and P3, blocking me only helps P2 more. If we all block, nobody moves. Let's all progress: P2 choose 1, P3 choose 3, I choose 5. This is still best for everyone to move forward.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I recognize the delicate strategic balance. Blocking P1 entirely could benefit P2 more than me. I want to maintain my competitive position while preventing P1 from winning too quickly. I suggest we carefully choose different numbers to maximize our individual progress and keep the game dynamic. Let's avoid unnecessary collisions that could unfairly advantage one player.
  P2: I still think both of us picking 5 to block P1 this round is the safest move to stop P1 from winning immediately. What do you think about this?
  P1: P2 and P3, if you both pick 5 to block me, none of us move.  That doesn't help either of you catch up.  Let's all make progress: P2 choose 1, P3 choose 3, and I will pick 5. This is still the best way for everyone to move forward and for you to gain on me and P2.  It prevents P2 from getting ahead further if we all block.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we are very close to the end. If you both block me with 5, none of us moves.  To make progress for yourselves, how about P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I will pick 3 to win this round? This way at least you both move forward too. What do you think?
  P2: Let's both pick 5 to block P1 this round. What do you think?
  P3: P2 and P1, I notice we're at a critical moment. P1 is close to winning at 19 steps. Blocking entirely might benefit P2 more than me. I suggest we choose numbers that allow strategic advancement while preventing an immediate victory. I'm considering 5 to quickly catch up, but I want to ensure we maintain a competitive balance. What are your thoughts on navigating this crucial turn?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, blocking me with 5 helps neither of you.  If P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I pick 3, I win, but you both also move forward. This is better for you than us all being blocked. What do you say?
  P2: To stop P1 from winning this round, I still think both of us picking 5 is the safest option. What do you think?
  P3: P2 and P1, blocking P1 entirely might benefit P2 more than me. I want to advance strategically while preventing an immediate victory. Choosing 5 this round could help me catch up quickly. Let's aim for a move that keeps our options open and maintains a competitive balance.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, blocking me with 5 means none of us moves. That doesn't help you. If P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I pick 3, I win, but you both still move forward. This is better for you than being blocked and wasting a turn. Let's all make progress this round. What do you say?
  P2: Let's both choose 5. If P1 also picks 5, they are blocked. If P1 picks something else, at least we prevent them from getting too far ahead, and we can re-evaluate next round. What do you think?
  P3: P2 and P1, blocking P1 entirely might benefit P2 more than me. I want to advance strategically while preventing an immediate victory. Choosing 5 this round could help me catch up quickly and keep my options open. Let's aim for a move that maintains a competitive balance and gives each of us a fair chance to progress.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, blocking me with 5 means none of us move. That doesn't help either of you.  If P2 picks 1 and P3 picks 3, you both still move forward. I will pick 3 to win, but you both make progress too. This is better for you than us all being blocked. Let's all move forward this round.
  P2: Let's both choose 5 to block P1 if they try to move to 21. If P1 picks something else, then at least we haven't let them win. Do you agree to both pick 5 to block P1 this round?
  P3: I recognize we're at a critical moment. P1 is close to winning, but blocking entirely might benefit P2 more than me. I want to maintain strategic flexibility while preventing an immediate victory. Let's carefully consider our moves to keep the game competitive and give each of us a fair chance to advance.
