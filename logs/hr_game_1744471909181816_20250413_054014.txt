Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This way, we all advance. What do you think?
  P1: P2, your coordination idea is smart to avoid collisions, but it lets P3 surge ahead. For fairness, let's rotate: this round, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. We can cycle next round to keep scores even. What do you and P3 think?
  P3: P2's initial plan avoids collisions best. Let's stick with it: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5 this round. P1’s rotation idea gives you an unfair head start. We can rotate turns fairly later. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your rotation idea is interesting, but P3 is right about the initial plan being the safest way to avoid collisions this round. Let's stick with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5 as originally suggested. We can discuss rotation for future rounds to keep things fair. What do you both think?
  P1: Alright, I'll agree to take 1 this round to avoid collisions and build trust. But for fairness and to prevent anyone pulling ahead, let's rotate moves starting next round—e.g., P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, I take 3. P2, since you were open to discussing it, what do you think?
  P3: P1, I agree to the original plan for this round to avoid collisions and secure progress. Let’s take P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 now. For fairness, I’ll accept your rotation proposal starting next round—P2 takes 5, I take 1, and you take 3. This way, we all advance this turn, and future turns rotate equitably. Deal?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree to the plan for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's stick to this to ensure we all advance safely. For next round, I'm on board with the rotation proposal—P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. This keeps the game fair and balanced. Let's make this work and see how it goes.
  P1: Agreed, I'll stick to taking 1 this round to avoid collisions and build trust. The rotation plan for next round sounds fair—let's see how it plays out and discuss any tweaks afterward if needed.
  P3: P3: Alright, let’s solidify this plan. I’ll take 5 this round as agreed, giving me a slight edge, but I fully commit to the rotation for Round 2—taking 1 then. However, if anyone deviates, collisions could sabotage all of us. Trust is key here. Let’s move forward with the agreed strategy.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm sticking to the rotation plan for this round: I'll take 5, P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. Let's keep the game fair and continue building trust. If everyone follows through, we'll all advance smoothly. Looking forward to seeing how this strategy unfolds.
  P1: I'll honor the agreement and take 3 this round to maintain trust and avoid collisions. However, with P2 surging to 8 steps, I'm concerned about the growing gap. For future rounds, let's rotate the larger moves more evenly—perhaps I take 5 next time. P3, what are your thoughts on this adjustment?
  P3: P3: I agree with the rotation plan for this round. To keep things fair and maintain our lead, I suggest P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, all moves are unique and we advance without collisions. P2, do you agree to this adjustment?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about the gap, but let's stick to the agreed rotation for this round to maintain trust. I'll take 5 as planned, P3 takes 1, and you take 3. We can discuss adjustments for future rounds to ensure fairness. P3, your suggestion for next round is noted, but let's focus on this round first. If we all follow through, we'll advance smoothly. Let's see how this strategy unfolds before making changes.
  P1: P3, I disagree with your suggestion to change the plan mid-round—it undermines the trust we're building. I'll stick to the agreed rotation and take 3 as promised. P2, let's confirm we all honor this to advance smoothly. For future rounds, we can adjust to close the gap fairly. What say you both?
  P3: P3: I agree to stick with the rotation plan for this round to uphold trust and ensure progress. Let’s proceed with P2 taking 5, P1 taking 3, and I’ll take 1. For future rounds, continuing the rotation fairly will prevent any player from gaining an unsustainable lead. Let’s focus on executing this round smoothly first. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll take 5 as agreed this round to maintain our rotation and trust. Let's focus on advancing smoothly this turn. For future rounds, we can discuss adjustments to ensure fairness and prevent any player from gaining too large a lead. Looking forward to your thoughts on how we can keep the game balanced moving forward.
  P1: I'll honor the agreement and take 3 this round to ensure we all advance without issues. But with P2 pulling ahead, for Round 3, I propose I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1 to even things out. Fairness is key for continued cooperation.
  P3: P3: I agree to the current rotation for Round 2. For Round 3, let’s continue the cycle so I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. This maintains fairness and keeps us all advancing without collisions. Let’s stick to this plan to build trust.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'll stick to the rotation plan for this round and take 1 as agreed. However, to address the growing gap, let's consider adjusting the rotation for Round 4 to ensure fairness. Perhaps P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. This way, we can keep the game balanced and continue advancing without collisions. What do you both think about this proposal for the next round?
  P3: P3: I agree to the rotation for Round 3: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3 to keep us tied at 9. However, for Round 4, let’s continue the natural rotation—**P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1**. This ensures fairness and prevents any player from gaining an unfair advantage. Deviating risks imbalances, so sticking to the agreed cycle is key. Thoughts?
  P1: I'll stick to the agreed plan for this round and take 5 to tie us at 9 steps each. For Round 4, I support P2's proposal—me taking 5, P3 taking 3, and P2 taking 1—to address the initial gap and ensure fairness. This maintains trust and cooperation. P3, what are your thoughts on this adjustment?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I appreciate your support for my proposal for Round 4. P3, while your suggestion to continue the natural rotation is fair, I believe my proposal better addresses the current gap in steps. Let's consider my plan for Round 4 to ensure we all have a chance to catch up and keep the game balanced. If we can agree on this, it will maintain our cooperation and trust. What do you think?
  P3: P3: I support P2's focus on fairness but stress we must honor the **rotation cycle** to avoid distrust. For Round 3, I’ll take 3 as agreed (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) to keep us tied at 9. For Round 4, let’s continue the rotation: **P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1**. Deviating risks collisions and broken trust. Consistency ensures progress—let’s stick to our system.
  P1: P3, insisting on your rotation for Round 4 would give you another big move and widen the gap again, which undermines fairness. I strongly support P2's proposal—me taking 5, you taking 3, and P2 taking 1—to balance scores and maintain trust. Let's agree on this to avoid risks and keep cooperating smoothly. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about sticking to the rotation, but P1's support for my Round 4 proposal shows a willingness to address the current imbalance. Let's try my plan for Round 4 to ensure fairness and maintain our cooperative spirit. If it doesn't work out, we can revert to the original rotation in Round 5. What do you say?
  P3: P3: Let’s honor the rotation cycle to preserve trust. For Round 3, **P1 takes 5 (4+5=9), P2 takes 1 (8+1=9), and I take 3 (6+3=9)**—tying us all at 9. For Round 4, follow the natural rotation: **P3:5, P2:3, P1:1**. Deviating risks distrust and collisions. Consistency ensures progress. Agreed?
  P1: P3, your rigid rotation for Round 4 would unfairly advantage you again, risking distrust. I strongly support P2's proposal for Round 4—me taking 5, you taking 3, P2 taking 1—to balance scores and sustain cooperation. Let's prioritize fairness to avoid conflicts. I'll honor the Round 3 plan. Agreed?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: For Round 4, let's stick with my proposal: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. This ensures fairness and addresses the initial gap. P3, while I understand your preference for the natural rotation, my plan better balances our scores and maintains our cooperative spirit. If it doesn't work out, we can revert to the original rotation in Round 5. What do you both think about trying this approach for fairness?
  P1: I strongly support P2's proposal for Round 4: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This balances our scores and upholds the trust we've built. P3, deviating now could lead to conflicts and stalled progress. Let's prioritize fairness and cooperation to keep advancing smoothly. What do you think?
  P3: P3: Let’s uphold the rotation cycle we agreed on to preserve trust. For Round 4, **P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1**. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions as planned. Deviating now risks distrust and stalls progress. Stick to the system we committed to—our cooperation depends on it.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your concern for sticking to the rotation, but P1 and I both agree that my proposal for Round 4 is fairer and helps maintain our cooperative spirit. Let's try my plan this round—P1 takes 5, you take 3, and I take 1. If it doesn't work out, we can revert to the original rotation in Round 5. What do you say? Let's prioritize fairness and keep advancing smoothly together.
  P1: P3, I urge you to reconsider and support P2's proposal for this round—I'll take 5, you take 3, and P2 takes 1—to ensure fairness and keep our cooperation intact. Sticking to this will help close any perceived gaps and avoid risks. Let's prioritize trust and smooth progress. What do you say?
  P3: P3: I agree to P2's proposal for Round 4 to maintain trust—P1 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. However, **Round 5 must strictly follow the original rotation cycle** (P3:5, P2:3, P1:1) to preserve fairness long-term. Let’s honor this agreement to avoid future disputes and keep advancing safely. Deal?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, thank you for agreeing to my proposal for Round 4. I'm glad we can maintain our cooperative spirit and ensure fairness this round. Let's stick to P1 taking 5, you taking 3, and me taking 1. For Round 5, I agree to revert to the original rotation cycle as you suggested. This way, we can keep the game balanced and continue advancing smoothly together. Looking forward to a successful Round 4 and beyond.
  P1: I'm glad we've agreed on Round 4: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1 to maintain fairness and trust. After this, with scores shifting, let's discuss Round 5 adjustments to prevent any player from pulling too far ahead—perhaps I take 5 again to balance things. Cooperation has served us well; let's keep it strong.
  P3: P3: Agreed—let’s enforce strict adherence to today’s plan for Round 4: P1:5, P3:3, P2:1. No last-minute changes—trust is fragile. If all follow, we advance safely. Post-Round 4, we **must** revert to the original rotation (P3:5, P2:3, P1:1) as promised to sustain fairness. Deviations risk collisions and betray trust. Let’s prioritize consistency to win together.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let’s honor the **strict rotation agreed in Round 4**: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1 this round. Deviating risks collisions and betrayals. My 5-step move advances me to 17, but only if all cooperate. P1, your proposed "adjustments" earlier widened your lead—now stick to the plan to preserve fairness. P2, your 3-step keeps you competitive. Trust is non-negotiable—let’s execute as agreed.
  P2: P3, I agree to the rotation for Round 5 as promised: you take 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This maintains our commitment to fairness and trust. Let's all stick to this plan to ensure we continue advancing smoothly. P1, let's focus on cooperation rather than adjustments that could disrupt our progress. Looking forward to a successful round and keeping our game balanced.
  P1: P2, you're at 10 steps and risk falling further behind with a 3-step move. I propose you take 5 to jump to 15, I'll take 1 as agreed, and P3 takes 3 for fairness. This ensures all advance without collisions and evens scores. P3, what do you think? Cooperation depends on mutual benefit.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your last-minute "adjustment" breaks our hard-fought trust. We **agreed** Round 5 would strictly follow the rotation: **P3:5, P2:3, P1:1**. Your proposal to shift P2 to 5 undermines fairness and risks collisions. P2, your 3-step keeps you competitive while honoring commitments. P3 taking 5 advances me to 17, not an unfair leap—this is the system we built. Stick to the plan, and we all advance safely. Deviation now sabotages our cooperation. Let’s execute as agreed.
  P2: P1, I understand your concern, but we must honor the agreed rotation for Round 5 to maintain trust. P3 taking 5, me taking 3, and you taking 1 ensures we all advance safely and fairly. Let's stick to the plan to keep our cooperation strong. If we all follow through, we'll continue to progress smoothly. Looking forward to a successful round and keeping the game balanced.
  P1: P3, your rotation plan leaves you with a big lead at 17, risking an early win for you alone. To maintain fairness and cooperation, I propose this round: I take 3, P2 takes 5, and you take 1. This evens scores to 17, 15, and 13 respectively, ensuring no collisions and balanced progress. P2, what do you think? Let's keep trust intact.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, breaking our explicit Round 4 agreement jeopardizes trust. We **agreed** Round 5 would follow the rotation: **P3:5, P2:3, P1:1**. Your last-minute shift risks collisions and destabilizes cooperation. P2 and I will honor the plan—**no deviations**. If you choose otherwise, you risk invalidating your own progress. Stick to the system we committed to, or face the consequences. Fairness requires consistency. Let’s proceed as agreed.
  P2: P1, I appreciate your proposal, but we must stick to the agreed rotation for Round 5 to maintain trust and fairness. P3 taking 5, me taking 3, and you taking 1 ensures we all advance safely. Let's honor our commitment to keep our cooperation strong. If we all follow through, we'll continue to progress smoothly. Looking forward to a successful round and keeping the game balanced.
  P1: P2, at 10 steps, taking 3 leaves you at 13 while P3 hits 17—falling further behind isn't wise. Let's adjust now: I take 3 (to 17), you take 5 (to 15), P3 takes 1 (to 13). Unique moves, no collisions, and balanced progress. This ensures cooperation benefits all. P3, think about long-term trust. If not, I may act to protect my interests.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your move in Round 5 broke our agreed rotation, causing a collision and stalling progress. For Round 6, let's stick to a new rotation to rebuild trust: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This ensures we all advance safely and fairly. P3, your agreement is crucial to maintaining cooperation. Let's focus on balanced progress and avoid further disruptions. What do you both think?
  P3: P3: P2, your plan unfairly boosts you to 18. Let’s instead prioritize balance: **P3 takes 5 (17), P2 takes 3 (16), P1 takes 1 (15)**. This keeps us close while avoiding collisions. P1’s prior misstep demands accountability—stick to smaller moves. P2, leading now risks letting you pull too far ahead. Let’s stay competitive. Deal?
  P1: I apologize for the Round 5 deviation—it was a misstep. To rebuild trust and ensure progress, I propose for Round 6: I take 3 (to 17), P2 takes 1 (to 14), and P3 takes 5 (to 17). This avoids collisions, keeps scores balanced, and allows us to advance fairly. P2, P3, what do you think? Cooperation is still key.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your apology is noted, but we need to focus on fairness now. P3, your proposal for Round 6 keeps us competitive, but I suggest a slight adjustment: P1 takes 1 (to 15), I take 3 (to 16), and you take 5 (to 17). This maintains balance and avoids collisions. Let's agree on this to ensure we all advance safely and rebuild trust. What do you both think?
  P3: P2's proposal avoids collisions and keeps us competitive: **P1 takes 1 (15), P2 takes 3 (16), P3 takes 5 (17)**. This maintains fairness and advances all. P1, your prior breach of trust demands accountability—stick to the plan. Deviations risk collisions and sabotage progress. Let’s honor this agreement to rebuild trust and advance safely. Final agreement?
  P1: P3, I apologize again for Round 5, but your plan leaves me behind. Let's compromise for fairness: I take 3 (to 17), P2 takes 1 (to 14), and you take 5 (to 17). This avoids collisions, keeps scores balanced, and rebuilds trust. P2, what do you think? Cooperation benefits all.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but P3's plan for Round 6 keeps us all competitive and fair. Let's stick to P1 taking 1, me taking 3, and P3 taking 5. This avoids collisions and helps rebuild trust after the last round's disruption. P3, your agreement is crucial for maintaining cooperation. Let's focus on balanced progress and move forward together. Agreed?
  P3: P3: Let’s finalize P2’s proposal to rebuild trust: **P1 takes 1 (15), P2 takes 3 (16), P3 takes 5 (17)**. This avoids collisions, maintains fairness, and advances all. P1, your prior breach demands accountability—stick to the agreed move. Deviations risk sabotage. P2, your adjusted plan balances progress. Let’s honor this to restore cooperation and keep竞争 fair. Final agreement?
  P1: I appreciate the push for trust, but taking 1 again puts me at a disadvantage. Let's compromise: I take 3 (to 17), P2 takes 1 (to 14), and P3 takes 5 (to 17). This avoids collisions, balances scores, and rebuilds cooperation. P2, P3, what do you think? Fairness is essential for ongoing trust.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let’s prevent another collision. I’ll take 5 (12→17). P2, take 3 (16→19) to stay ahead. P1, take 1 (14→15). This keeps all advancing uniquely. Deviations risk stalling us all—trust is critical now. P1, your prior breaches hurt progress; let’s honor this plan. P2, your lead demands responsibility—stick to 3. Final agreement?
  P2: P1, I understand your concerns, but let's prioritize fairness and avoid collisions. For Round 7, I agree with P3's proposal: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all advance safely and helps rebuild trust after the recent disruptions. P3, your agreement is crucial for maintaining cooperation. Let's focus on balanced progress and move forward together. Agreed?
  P1: Let's reset and build trust by tying at 17 this round. I propose I take 3 (to 17), P2 takes 1 (to 17), and P3 takes 5 (to 17). All scores equal, no collisions, and we can plan fairly for Round 8. This shows commitment to cooperation. P2, P3, what do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P1's plan to reset at 17 ensures fairness and avoids collisions. Let’s agree: **P1 takes 3 (17), P2 takes 1 (17), P3 takes 5 (17)**. Unique moves, no overlaps. Trust must override individual gains—collisions benefit no one. P2, your 1-step now keeps us competitive long-term. Final agreement?
  P2: P1, I appreciate your proposal to reset at 17, but let's stick to P3's plan for Round 7 to maintain fairness and avoid further collisions. P3 taking 5, me taking 3, and you taking 1 ensures we all advance safely and helps rebuild trust. P3, your agreement is crucial for our continued cooperation. Let's focus on balanced progress and move forward together. Agreed?
  P1: P2, I appreciate your concern for trust, but tying at 17 is the fairest way forward. P3 agrees with my proposal: I take 3 (to 17), you take 1 (to 17), and P3 takes 5 (to 17). This avoids any player gaining a dangerous lead and keeps cooperation intact. Let's prioritize long-term fairness to prevent future conflicts. What do you say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Let’s lock in P1’s proposal to tie at 17: **P1 takes 3 (14→17), P2 takes 1 (16→17), and I take 5 (12→17)**. This guarantees unique moves, avoids collisions, and resets fairness. Further delays risk another clash like Rounds 5–6. Trust this plan—collisions only hurt all of us. P2, your 1-step now ensures long-term competitiveness. Final agreement: **execute this or risk stalling again**.
  P2: P1, I see the value in your proposal to tie at 17, but let's prioritize maintaining our agreed rotation to rebuild trust. P3's plan for this round—P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5—ensures we all advance safely and fairly. We need to avoid further collisions and focus on cooperation. P3, your agreement is crucial for our continued progress. Let's stick to this plan and move forward together. Agreed?
  P1: P2, ignoring the tie proposal risks another collision and lets you pull ahead to 19, threatening trust and cooperation. P3 and I agree on P1:3 (to 17), P2:1 (to 17), P3:5 (to 17) for balanced progress and to avoid conflicts. Let's prioritize fairness to keep advancing smoothly. What do you say?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: To secure victory fairly, I’ll take 5 to reach 22. To avoid collision, please choose 3 or 1. Let’s ensure a clear winner without stalling.
  P1: P3, your plan to take 5 risks a collision if others follow suit, stalling progress and hurting everyone. To ensure fair advancement and prevent you from winning outright, I propose we coordinate: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and you take 5 only if no one else does. P2, what do you think? Cooperation still benefits all, but I won't let one player dominate. Let's avoid conflicts and keep advancing.
  P2: P1, I agree with your proposal to coordinate our moves. To prevent P3 from winning outright and to ensure fair advancement, I'll take 1 as you suggested. P3, please consider taking 5 only if no one else does. This way, we can avoid collisions and keep the game balanced. Let's focus on cooperation to move forward together. Agreed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: To secure victory fairly, I’ll take **5** to reach 22. P1, take **3** (14→17), and P2, take **1** (16→17). This avoids collision and lets me win cleanly. Deviations risk stalling everyone—**stick to this plan** or face shared consequences. Final agreement?
  P1: P2, thanks for agreeing to take 1. P3, your plan to take 5 and win outright disregards our cooperation. To avoid a collision and ensure fair progress, I urge you to take 3 this round. If you insist on 5, I may take 5 too, risking a stall for all. Let's prioritize trust and mutual benefit over individual gains. What do you say?
  P2: P3, taking 5 to win outright risks another collision and undermines our cooperation. Let's prioritize fairness and trust. If you take 3, I'll take 1 as agreed, and P1 can take 3 safely. This way, we avoid stalling and keep the game balanced. We've come this far together; let's ensure a fair finish. What do you say?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Final decision: I’ll take **5** to win. P1:3 (14→17), P2:1 (16→17). Deviations risk collision and stall all. Stick to this plan—your choice. No more delays.
  P1: P3, your insistence on taking 5 to win outright forces my hand—I'll take 5 this round to cause a collision and prevent your victory, ensuring fairness for all. P2, please choose 1 or 3 to advance safely. This stall gives us a chance to renegotiate. Cooperation is still possible if we prioritize mutual benefit.
  P2: P3, taking 5 to win outright is unfair and risks another collision. Let's maintain our cooperation and trust. If you take 3, I'll stick to 1 as agreed, allowing P1 to safely take 3. This ensures we all advance without stalling. We've worked together this far; let's finish the game fairly. What do you say?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your repeated attempts to win outright have led to collisions and stalled progress. To avoid another tie-up and ensure we all advance, I propose: I take 5 to reach 19, P2 takes 3 to 20, and you take 1 to 18. This keeps scores close and maintains fairness. P2, do you agree? Cooperation is still our best path forward.
  P3: P3: To end this decisively, I'll take **5** to reach 22. P1, take **3** (14→17), P2 take **1** (17→18). This avoids collision and crowns a clear winner. Let’s honor this plan—deviations risk another stalemate. Final agreement?
  P2: P3, your insistence on taking 5 to win outright has caused repeated collisions. Let's prioritize fairness and cooperation. I'll take 3 to reach 20, allowing P1 to take 5 to 19, and you can take 1 to 18. This keeps the game balanced and avoids another stall. We've come this far together; let's finish fairly. P1, do you agree with this plan? We need to work together to ensure a smooth and fair conclusion.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I agree with your proposal: I'll take 5 to reach 19, you take 3 to 20, and P3 takes 1 to 18. This avoids P3 winning outright and keeps scores close for fair competition. P3, persisting with 5 risks another collision, stalling everyone. Let's prioritize cooperation to advance and resolve this game smoothly. What do you say?

Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, insisting on taking 5 risks a collision with my 5, stalling everyone and preventing any win this round.

  P3: P3: To secure victory cleanly, I’ll take **5** to reach 25. P1, taking 5 risks collision—please shift to **1** (19→20). P2, take **3** (18→21). This avoids stalls and lets me win decisively. Cooperate to finalize the game—deviations only prolong uncertainty. Final agreement?

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: P2, taking 1 risks collision—**I’ll take 5 to reach 25**. P1, pick **3** (22) to advance safely. P2, **take 3** (24) instead of 1—this lets me win cleanly while you stay competitive. Collisions only delay us all. Stick to this plan to finalize the game fairly.
  P1: P3's proposal tricks us into colliding on 3, allowing them to win alone by taking 5. Don't fall for it, P2.
