Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello P2 and P3, let's try to coordinate to maximize our steps this round. How about P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5? This way we can all move forward. What do you think?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3 is leading. Let's both pick 5 to block them if they go for it again. Otherwise, we can advance. What do you think?
  P1: P2, you're right about P3. To stop them, how about I choose 3 to try to advance, and you stick with your idea of 5 to block P3 if they try 5 again? Does that sound reasonable?
  P3: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** Agreed, P1. I'll pick 5 to block P3. P3, if you choose 5 again, we both lose the move. Better pick 1 or 3.
  P1: Sounds good, P2. I will choose 3 this round.
  P3: <stop>


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** P3, I'm blocking 5 again. Choose 1 or 3 to avoid collision. P1, pick 3 to advance. Let's halt P3's lead together.
  P1: Sounds good P2, I will choose 3 as suggested.
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: **P2:** P3, P1 is the main threat now. If you pick 3, you block them while I go 5. This stops P1's lead. Let's work together this round. P1, if you pick 3 again, you'll be blocked.
  P1: P2, since you think P1 is the main threat, maybe we should both pick 1 to avoid collision this round and both advance? What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: **P2:** P3, blocking P1's 3 with your 3 stops their lead while I take 5. If they pick 3, you both lose. P1, suggesting 1 is a trap to collide us. I won't risk it. Cooperate to halt P1's progress.
  P1: P2, okay, I understand you want to block 3. To avoid collision, I will choose 1 this round.  Hopefully at least one of us will advance. What do you think P3 will pick?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: **P2:** P3, choosing 3 is your best play. If P1 picks 3, you block them; if they pick 1, you gain 3 steps. I’ll take 5. We both advance if you cooperate. If you stubbornly pick 5 again, we collide, and P1 wins. Stop self-sabotage—align with me to halt P1.
  P1: P3, P2 is clearly trying to use you to block me while they advance. If you pick 3 as P2 suggests, only P2 will move forward.  If you pick 1 with me, we both advance while P2 is picking 5.  It's your choice, but picking 1 with me benefits us both more than helping P2.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, P2 is trying to use you to block me while they advance. If you pick 3 as P2 suggests, only P2 will move forward. If you pick 5 with me, we can block P2 together and neither of us will be blocked by P2. Let's stop P2 from advancing.
  P2: **P2:** P3, think strategically. P1 is at 10 steps—closest to victory. If you pick 5, you block P1 if they greedily take 5 again. I’ll pick 3 to block their 3. Either way, P1 stalls. If you pick 1, you gain steps risk-free. But 5 is safer to ensure P1 doesn’t leap ahead. Let’s prioritize halting P1.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, P2 is clearly focusing on blocking me to help themselves win.  If you want to advance and not just be used by P2, consider picking 1. If you pick 1 and I pick 5, we both have a good chance to move forward, especially if P2 keeps trying to block me with 3 or 5. Let's make a move that helps us both, not just P2.
  P2: **P2:** P3, if you pick 3, you block P1's 3 or gain 3 if they pick 1. I'll take 5 to block them if they go 5. If you stubbornly pick 5 again, we collide and P1 wins. The math is clear: unite against P1. Let’s both advance by choosing 3 and 5. Don’t let P1 trick you into self-sabotage.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, you can see P2 is just trying to eliminate me so they can win.  Don't fall for it. If you pick 1 with me, we both have a chance to advance while P2 is focused on blocking me.  I will pick 5 this round.  Let's work together to get ahead of P2.
  P2: **P2:** P3, final chance to act smart. If you pick 3, you block P1's 3 (stalling them) **or** gain 3 steps if they pick 1. I’ll block their 5. If you pick 5 again, we collide, P1 advances, and you lose. Choose 3 to halt P1 and secure your own progress. No more self-sabotage.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** P3, P1's next move is 5 to reach 15. Block them by choosing 5 again. I'll take 3 to advance. United, we stop P1's lead. Don't let them win.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, P2 is clearly trying to manipulate you to focus only on blocking me, while they try to win.  Don't fall for it again!  If we both pick 1, we both advance and get closer to winning, regardless of what P2 does.  Let's both choose 1 this round to move forward together.  What do you say?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** P3, focus! P1 is tied with you at 10. If you pick 5, you block their 5 (stalling them) or gain 5 steps if they pick 1. I'll block their 3. P1’s "1" suggestion risks colliding with you. Choose 5 to secure your lead. United, we halt P1. Don’t let them trick you into self-sabotage.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, you can see P2 is trying to set us up again.  If you pick 5 to block my '5' as P2 suggests, and P2 picks 3, then only P2 moves forward.  If we BOTH pick 1, we BOTH move forward.  Don't let P2 control your move to only benefit them. Choose 1 with me so we both advance.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** P3, critical moment: P1 is at 10. If they pick 5, they hit 15—closest to victory. Block their 5 by choosing 5 yourself; I’ll take 3. If they pick 5, they stall. If they pick 1, you surge to 15. Refuse P1’s risky "1" trap—colliding with them helps neither. Prioritize halting P1’s sprint to 20. United, we stop their lead. Choose 5.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, P2 is setting you up again. If you block my '5' as P2 wants, only P2 benefits. Let's both pick 1. We both move forward, and P2 can't control us.  Don't let P2 manipulate you into helping them win while we stay stuck. Choose 1 with me for our own progress.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, P2 is still trying to use you to block me for their benefit.  Look at the score: you and I are closer to winning than P2.  If you keep blocking me as P2 wants, P2 will win. Let's both pick 1 this round. If P2 tries to block 3 or 5, we both advance. Don't let P2 control your move again.  Let's work together to both get closer to 20.
  P2: **P2:** P3, you’re at 15—**one 5 away from victory**. But if you pick 5, I’ll block you again. Don’t throw the game. Choose 3 or 1 to survive. P1, if you pick 5 too, we **all collide** and stop P3. This is your last chance to unite against the real threat. Don’t let P3 win now.
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, P2 is trying to scare you, but look - if you pick 5 and P2 blocks, we are both stuck. If we BOTH pick 1, we BOTH move closer to winning while P2 is busy with their blocking plans.  Let's both pick 1 and advance together this round. Don't let P2 control your move again.
  P2: **P2:** P3, I pick 5. If you choose 5, we collide and you lose. Pick 3 to reach 18; next round, take 3 to win. P1, if you pick 5, we all collide. Don’t let P3 win. Choose 1 or 3.
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, P2 is likely bluffing about picking 5 to block you. They probably want to pick 3 to win themselves. If you pick 3 as P2 suggests, you risk colliding with P2. Let's both pick 1.  If P2 picks 3 or 5 as they say, we both advance while P2 might be blocked or move alone. Don't trust P2's manipulation again. Let's cooperate and pick 1.
  P2: **P2:** P3, I pick 5. If you choose 5, we collide and you lose. P1, if you pick 5, we all block P3. This is our only chance to stop them from winning. Choose 5 now or lose.
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you are closest to winning, P2 will definitely try to block you.  If you pick 5, you risk collision with P2.  Let's both pick 1 this round. If P2 tries to block either of us with 3 or 5, we both advance. Don't let P2 control your move again. Let's cooperate for our own progress.
  P2: **P2:** P3, pick 5 again and we collide—game over. Choose 3 to block P1's likely 3, halting their sprint to 20. If they pick 3, you both stall; if they pick 1, you gain 3 steps. I'll take 5 to prevent their 5. This is your only path to victory. P1, if you pick 3 again, you’re blocked. Switch to 1 or 5 at your peril.
  P3: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, P2 is clearly trying to block YOU again, not me. If you pick 3 as P2 suggests, you risk colliding with P2. Let's both pick 1 to advance safely this round. Don't let P2 control your move and block you again.
  P2: **P2:** P3, pick 5 and we collide—you lose. Choose 3 to block P1's 3 (halting them) **or** gain 3 steps. I’ll block their 5. Next turn, take 3 to win. P1, if you pick 5, we all collide. Switch to 1 or 3 to survive. No more risks.
  P3: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, P2 is bluffing again and will likely pick 5 to block you.  To avoid collision with P2, consider picking 3. If you pick 3, I will pick 5. This way, if P2 picks 5 as expected, you will move to 18 and I will move to 19. Don't let P2 control your move, let's both try to advance.
  P2: **P2:** P3, pick 3 to block P1's 3—halting their sprint. If they pick 3, you both stall; if they pick 1, you gain 3. I’ll block their 5. If you pick 5 again, we collide and **you lose**. P1, repeating 3 is futile—switch to 1 or 5 and risk collision. Cooperate to survive.
  P3: <stop>


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, P2 will likely try to block your 5 again. To avoid collision with P2, please pick 1. I will pick 5. This way, if P2 blocks your 5, you will still move forward, and if P2 picks something else, we both have a chance to move.
  P2: **P2:** P3, P1 is rushing to 19 with 5. Block them by choosing 5. I’ll pick 5 to ensure they stall. If you pick 1, P1 surges ahead. United, we halt P1’s sprint. Don’t fall for their trap.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, P2 is trying to trick you again. I'm at 14, not 19. P2 is desperate to stop us both so they can catch up. Don't fall for it. If you pick 3, and I pick 5, we both have a chance to move forward if P2 doesn't pick 5.  Let's both pick different numbers than P2 to ensure at least one of us advances this round.
  P2: **P2:** P3, pick 5 and I block you—game over. Choose 3 to block P1's 3. I’ll take 5 to halt their 5. P1, if you pick 3, you collide with P3. Switch to 1 or face a block.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, P2 is clearly trying to eliminate you as the leader. Don't fall for their block again. If you pick 1, and I pick 3, we both have a good chance to move forward, no matter what P2 does.  Let's coordinate to advance together and not let P2 control the game.
  P2: **P2:** P3, pick 5 and we collide—game over. Choose 3 to block P1's 3. I’ll take 5 to halt their 5. P1, if you pick 3, you collide with P3. Cooperate to survive.

  P3: 15 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, P2 will block your 5 again. To avoid collision and move forward, please pick 1. I will pick 3 to try to win this round. If P2 blocks your 5 as usual, my 3 might get through. Let's both try to make progress.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: **P2:** P3, pick 5 and we collide—P1 wins. Choose 3 to block P1’s 3 (their only path to 20). I’ll take 5 to halt their 5. If P1 picks 3, you both stall; if they pick 1, you gain 3 steps. Don’t let them win—cooperate now.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, P2 is clearly trying to make you block for them again.  Don't fall for it.  P2 will likely pick 5 to block you. If you pick 1 and I pick 3, we both have a chance to move forward if P2 picks 5 as usual. Let's both pick 1 or 3 to avoid P2's block and try to advance.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: **P2:** P3, final warning: if you pick 5 again, we collide and P1 wins instantly at 20. Choose 3 to block their 3 (their only path to victory) and survive. I’ll block their 5. Next round, you can take 5 to win. Cooperate now or lose. P1, your greed will backfire.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, P2 is clearly trying to scare you into blocking for them again.  Don't fall for it. I am going to pick 3 to try to win this round. If you pick 1, you will at least move forward while P2 is busy with their blocking plan.  It's your best chance to also make progress.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: **P2:** P3, pick 3 to block P1's 3. If they pick 3, you both stall. If they pick 1, you gain 3 steps. I’ll block 5. Don’t gamble on 5 and risk collision—let P1 win. Cooperate now or lose. P1, your greed ends here.
