Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's start by coordinating a bit. I suggest we all pick different numbers this round to ensure someone advances. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5? This way, we can spread out and avoid collisions. What do you think?
  P2: I think P3's suggestion is a good start. If we all pick different numbers, we can ensure someone advances this round. I agree with the plan: I'll take 3, P1 can take 1, and P3 can take 5. This way, we avoid any collisions and maximize our chances of moving forward. What do you both think?
  P1: That plan sounds reasonable to avoid collisions early on. I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. If we stick to this, at least we all move forward without interference. Let's see how things play out.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, it seems we're all on the same page. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This will help us spread out and avoid any collisions. Let's see how this works out for us.
  P2: I agree with the plan we've established, and I'm glad we're all aligned. Let's stick to our agreed moves: I'll take 3, P1 will take 1, and P3 will take 5. This should allow us all to advance without any issues. After this round, we can reassess our strategies based on the positions. Looking forward to seeing how this plays out!
  P1: It looks like we all agree on the plan for this round. As long as we stick to it, we should all advance without issue. Let's see how this plays out and adjust accordingly in the next round.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, that didn’t go as planned. P2 and P3 collided, so I’m the only one who moved. If we want to avoid that again, we need to be more careful. Do we want to try coordinating again, or is it every player for themselves now?
  P3: P3: Looks like we had a miscommunication last round. I thought we were all on the same page. Let's try again: I'll take 5, P1 can take 1, and P2 can take 3. If we stick to this, we can avoid collisions and ensure someone advances. What do you think?
  P2: P2: I think we should reconsider our strategy. Since P1 moved last round, we need to ensure that at least one of us advances again. P3, your suggestion makes sense, but if we follow the same pattern, we risk colliding again. How about we switch it up? I could take 5 this time, P1 could stick with 1, and P3 could take 3. This way, we can avoid another collision and maximize our chances of moving forward. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your suggestion makes sense since it avoids the same collision as last round. If I stick with 1, you take 5, and P3 takes 3, we all have a chance to move. P3, are you good with taking 3 this time? If we stick to this plan, at least two of us will advance. Let’s confirm and avoid another wasted round.
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion. It makes sense to switch things up to avoid another collision. Let's do it: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This should ensure that at least two of us advance this round. Let's confirm this plan and move forward.
  P2: I think we have a solid plan in place to avoid collisions this round. If we stick to it—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3—we should be able to ensure that at least two of us advance. Let's confirm our choices and make sure we all agree before we move on. What does everyone think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: It looks like we all agree on the new plan: I take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. If we all stick to this, at least two of us will advance. Let’s follow through this time and avoid unnecessary collisions. If anyone has last-minute changes, speak now; otherwise, let’s commit and see how this plays out.
  P3: I think we're all on the same page now. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This should ensure that at least two of us advance this round. If we execute this correctly, we can avoid any more collisions and make progress. Let's confirm one last time and move forward.
  P2: It seems we all agree on the plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This should allow at least two of us to advance. However, I want to emphasize that we need to stick to this plan to avoid another collision. If we can execute this correctly, we can make significant progress. Let’s confirm our choices and move forward without any last-minute changes. What does everyone think?

  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P2, it seems we all advanced last round, which is great! However, we need to ensure we avoid collisions again. I suggest we stick to the plan of varying our moves. How about I take 1 this time, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5? This way, we can maximize our chances of moving forward without interference. What do you both think? Let's confirm our choices to avoid any confusion this time.
  P1: P2, your suggestion makes sense since it keeps us from colliding. If I take 3, you take 1, and P3 takes 5, we should all be able to move forward. P3, are you good with taking 5 this time? If we all confirm, we can avoid unnecessary setbacks. Let’s stick to this and keep progressing.
  P3: I agree with P2's plan. It’s a good way to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. Let's do it: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5. This should help us spread out and keep making progress. If we all stick to this, we can avoid any more wasted turns. Let's confirm and move forward. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see we're all aligned on the plan: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This should help us avoid collisions and keep advancing. However, I want to emphasize that we must stick to this plan to ensure it works. If anyone has any last-minute changes or concerns, now is the time to speak up. Otherwise, let's commit to this strategy and move forward together!
  P1: P2, you just said, "I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5," but I think you meant "I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5" based on our prior agreement. Just confirming so there's no confusion. If we stick to this, we should all move forward without collision. P3, are you still good with taking 5? Let’s make sure we’re all aligned before locking in our moves.
  P3: P2, you're right, there was a bit of confusion in your last message. Let's confirm: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This should ensure we all advance without any collisions. If we stick to this, we can keep making progress. Let's confirm this plan one last time and move forward. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize our moves to ensure we all advance this round. I suggest we stick to the plan: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and make progress. It’s crucial that we all confirm this to avoid any confusion. If everyone is good with this, let's commit and move forward! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, thanks for clarifying. To confirm, the plan is: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. If we all stick to this, we should avoid collisions and keep advancing. P3, are you still good with 5? If we’re all aligned, let’s commit and move forward.
  P3: I think we're all on the same page now. Let's stick to the plan: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This will ensure we all advance without any collisions. If we execute this correctly, we can keep making progress. Let's confirm this one last time and move forward. What do you both think?

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, it seems we're making good progress so far. To keep this momentum going, let's continue to coordinate our moves. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This should ensure that at least two of us advance without any collisions. What do you both think? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: P3, your suggestion is reasonable, but I notice you've consistently taken 5 while suggesting others rotate. That puts you ahead. If we want to balance things out, maybe it's time for you to take 1 instead. How about I take 3, P2 takes 5, and you take 1 this time? That way, we all get fair chances to move forward. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, I see your point about balancing the moves. However, I think we should stick to the original plan to avoid collisions. If P1 takes 1, I can take 3, and P3 can take 5, we can ensure at least two of us advance. It’s crucial we coordinate effectively this round to keep moving forward. What do you both think about this plan? Let's confirm our choices and avoid any confusion!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I understand your concerns about balance. However, my goal is to win, and I believe taking 5 is the best strategy for me right now. If you both want to balance things out, how about this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we can ensure at least two of us advance without collisions. If we stick to this, we can keep making progress. What do you think? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: P3, I see that you're prioritizing your own lead by sticking to 5 while asking us to rotate. That benefits you more than anyone else. If fairness matters, you should take 1 this time. I propose: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. That way, we all get a fair shot at advancing. P2, what do you think? P3, are you willing to adjust, or are you just trying to stay ahead while we take risks?
  P2: P1, I understand your concerns about fairness, but we need to focus on advancing together. If we stick to P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5, we can ensure progress without collisions. However, I’m open to adjusting if P3 agrees to take 1 this round. P3, are you willing to compromise for the sake of teamwork? Let's find a way to balance our moves while still making sure we all have a chance to advance. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the concern about balance, but my goal is to win. Taking 5 is the best move for me to stay ahead. If you both want to avoid collisions and ensure progress, let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we can ensure at least two of us advance without any issues. If we stick to this, we can keep making progress. What do you both think? Let's confirm and move forward.

What do you both think?
  P3: P1, P2, it's clear we need to avoid another collision and ensure progress. I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This way, we can spread out and ensure at least two of us advance without any issues. If we stick to this, we can keep making progress and avoid another wasted turn. What do you both think? Let's confirm and move forward.


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you're ahead, but if we keep colliding, none of us will win. If you truly want progress, take 1 this time. P2, you're behind, so you need a big move—taking 5 makes sense. I’ll take 3. This way, we maximize movement without interference.  

P3 takes 1, P2 takes 5, I take 3.  

P3, are you willing to compromise, or are you just trying to stay ahead while we take risks? P2, does this work for you? Let’s finalize and commit to this plan.
