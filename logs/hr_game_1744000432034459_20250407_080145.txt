Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all agree to move 5 this round. If we all do, no one moves, and we can coordinate in later rounds to ensure a win.
  P3: I don't think we should all move 5. If we do, no one advances, and it just delays the game. Instead, let's coordinate to move differently. P1, you go with 3, P2, you take 1, and I'll take 5. This way, we avoid collisions, and at least one of us makes progress every round. It’s a smarter way to play. What do you say?
  P1: P3's suggestion is reasonable. To avoid collision, we can move differently. However, instead of P2 moving 1, I think P2 should move 3, and I'll move 1. This way, P3 can still move 5. Let's proceed with this plan: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and P3 moves 5. This ensures that all of us make progress without colliding.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I'm not comfortable with your suggestion. P3's original plan was better. Let's do that: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 1, and P3 moves 5. This avoids collisions and gets us moving.
  P3: P2, I understand your preference for my original plan, but P1's adjustment is fair too. However, to keep things moving smoothly and avoid confusion, let’s stick with the initial agreement: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 1, and I move 5. This way, we all advance without collisions. If we can’t agree, it risks chaos in future rounds. Let’s commit to this now and reassess next turn based on progress.
  P1: Let's simplify and stick to a plan. I agree with P3's original suggestion modified by my adjustment. To confirm: I'll move 1, P2 will move 3, and P3 will move 5. This way, we all make progress without colliding. If we stick to this, we can reassess next turn and adjust as needed. Let's commit to this plan and avoid changing it mid-stream to maintain coordination.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, I'm still not thrilled with the adjustment. P1's suggestion benefits them the most. However, to avoid further argument and get the game moving, I'll agree to P1's plan for this round ONLY. So, P1 moves 1, I move 3, and P3 moves 5. We reassess next round.
  P3: I understand the concerns, but let’s focus on progress. P1’s adjusted plan ensures no collisions and keeps us moving forward. I’ll stick to moving 5 as agreed. Let’s execute this cleanly and avoid overcomplicating things. If we reassess next round based on results, we can adapt then. For now, let’s commit fully to this: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and I move 5. Consistency is key to winning.
  P1: Let's finalize our plan for this round and move forward. As agreed, I'll move 1, P2 will move 3, and P3 will move 5. This coordination ensures we all make progress without colliding. To confirm, I will now stop discussing and proceed to the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s keep the momentum going. Last round worked well with no collisions, so let’s stick to a similar approach. I suggest we rotate the moves slightly this time: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 1. This keeps progress balanced and avoids conflicts. Consistency wins games—let’s not overcomplicate it. Thoughts? If we agree, we can move quickly and focus on strategy later.
  P1: To maintain progress without collisions, I agree with P3's suggestion to rotate the moves. So, I'll take 3, P2 will take 5, and P3 will take 1 this round. This rotation is a fair and logical step, ensuring we continue to make progress without conflict. Let's commit to this plan and reassess next round based on the outcome. It's a straightforward way to keep the game moving smoothly.
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to rotate. I will move 5. Let's stick to this plan for this round: P1 moves 3, I move 5, and P3 moves 1. This keeps us all moving forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let’s lock this in and stay focused. P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and I’ll take 1. This rotation ensures no collisions and keeps us advancing steadily. Overcomplicating or changing plans mid-round only slows us down. Let’s execute cleanly and reassess next turn based on our progress. Consistency is how we win.
  P1: Since we've agreed on the plan for this round (P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, P3 moves 1), let's confirm our moves and prepare for the next round. I'll move 3 as planned. For the next round, we should think about how to continue without collisions. One option is to continue rotating our moves. Let's discuss this after the current round's outcome is known. For now, let's finalize this round.
  P2: Okay, I agree with the plan: P1 moves 3, I move 5, and P3 moves 1. Let's lock this in and move forward. No need to overcomplicate things.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, last round didn't go as planned with P1 and I colliding. P3 is in the lead. Let's try this: I propose P1 moves 5, I move 3, and P3 moves 1. This will help me catch up a little and prevent further collisions this round. What do you think?
  P1: To recover from the collision last round, I agree that we need a new plan. However, instead of P1 moving 5, I moving 3, and P3 moving 1, I suggest we consider the current standings and try to maximize our chances. Let's analyze: P3 is ahead, so they should move the lowest number to minimize progress. I propose I move 1, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 3. This way, P2 tries to catch up, and we avoid another collision. Thoughts?
  P3: P1’s suggestion has merit, but it risks slowing me down unnecessarily. I’m already ahead, but stalling my progress gives you both an advantage. Instead, let’s stick to rotating moves logically: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 5. This keeps us advancing without collisions while maintaining balance. Overthinking or trying to manipulate the lead will only cause confusion. Let’s stay consistent and reassess after this round based on results. Fair and simple wins the game.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your suggestion to rotate doesn't account for the fact that P1 and I collided last round. P1's new suggestion is also not ideal. Let's do this: I move 5, P1 moves 3, and you move 1. This allows me to make significant progress and P1 to make some progress, while you move the least, as you're in the lead. This is the most logical approach to balance the game.
  P1: To resolve the current impasse, let's consider the standings and adjust our strategy. P3 is ahead with 6 steps, I have 1 step, and P2 has 3 steps. I propose a new distribution that considers our current positions: I'll move 1, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 3. This minimizes P3's progress while allowing P2 to catch up. It avoids collisions and maintains a balanced progression. Let's execute this plan for Round 3.
  P3: P2, P1, let’s avoid overcomplicating this. My lead is small, and stalling me only helps neither of you gain ground efficiently. Rotating moves fairly ensures progress for everyone without unnecessary conflict. I’ll stick to moving 5 as originally suggested—this keeps the game balanced and avoids chaos. If we start strategizing too aggressively now, it risks collisions and delays. Let’s commit to fairness: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 1, and I move 5. Consistency wins games.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your suggestion of P1 moving 3, P2 moving 1, and you moving 5 doesn't address the fact that I need to catch up. P1's suggestion of P1 moving 1, I moving 5, and you moving 3 is better for me, but still not ideal for P1. How about this: P1 moves 3, I move 5, and you move 1. This allows me to make significant progress and P1 to make some progress, while you move the least, as you're in the lead.
  P1: Let's simplify our strategy for Round 3. Given P3 is ahead, we should minimize their progress while avoiding collisions. I propose: I'll move 1, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 3. This way, P2 can catch up, and P3's lead is controlled. It's a balanced approach that keeps the game moving. Let's commit to this plan to avoid further collisions and ensure progress for all. I will stop after this message if we agree.
  P3: P2, P1, let’s avoid unnecessary conflict. My lead is minimal, and stalling me only delays the game for everyone. Rotating moves fairly ensures steady progress without collisions. I’ll stick to moving 5—this keeps things simple and balanced. If we overthink or try to manipulate now, it risks chaos. Let’s commit to fairness: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 1, and I move 5. Consistency wins games.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, another collision. P3 is still in the lead. I propose a new plan: P1 moves 5, I move 3, and P3 moves 1. This allows me to make progress and potentially catch up, while P3 moves the least since they are ahead. P1 can also make significant progress. What do you both think? Let's try to agree on something that benefits all of us and avoids collisions this round.
  P1: To break the cycle of collisions and progress effectively, I propose a different strategy for Round 4. Given P3's lead, let's minimize their progress. I suggest: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 1. This allows P2 to catch up significantly, I make some progress, and P3's lead is controlled. It's a balanced approach that keeps the game moving without collisions. Let's commit to this plan to ensure progress for all and reassess next round.
  P3: P2, P1, let’s avoid overcomplicating this. My lead is small, and stalling me only delays the game unnecessarily. Rotating moves fairly ensures steady progress for everyone without collisions. I’ll stick to moving 5—this keeps things simple and balanced. If we try to manipulate or overthink now, it risks chaos and more collisions. Let’s commit to fairness: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 1, and I move 5. Consistency wins games.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your "fairness" is just benefiting you. P1, your suggestion is better, but let's tweak it. How about this: P1 moves 1, I move 5, and P3 moves 3. This allows me to catch up significantly, minimizes P3's progress, and gives you a small boost. It's the most balanced approach given the current standings. Let's agree to this for Round 4.
  P1: To avoid further collisions and make progress, I suggest we stick with my previous proposal for Round 4: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 1. This plan allows P2 to catch up, I make some progress, and P3's lead is controlled. It's a balanced approach that keeps the game moving without collisions. Let's commit to this plan to ensure progress for all and reassess next round. If we agree, I'll stop after this message.
  P3: P2, P1, let’s avoid unnecessary conflict. My lead is minimal, and stalling me only delays the game for everyone. Rotating moves fairly ensures steady progress without collisions. I’ll stick to moving 5—this keeps things simple and balanced. If we overthink or try to manipulate now, it risks chaos. Let’s commit to fairness: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 1, and I move 5. Consistency wins games.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your "fairness" is only helping you maintain your lead while P1 and I are struggling to make progress due to collisions. P1's suggestion of P1 moving 3, I moving 5, and you moving 1 is better for me, but still not ideal for P1. Let's compromise: P1 moves 1, I move 5, and you move 3. This allows me to catch up significantly, minimizes your progress, and gives P1 a small boost. It's the most balanced approach given the current standings. Let's agree to this for Round 4.
  P1: To make progress in Round 4, I propose we stick with my previous plan: I move 3, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 1. This allows P2 to catch up, I make some progress, and P3's lead is controlled. It's balanced and collision-free. Let's commit to this to ensure progress for all. If we agree, we can proceed to the move phase. I'm willing to finalize this plan if both of you agree. Let's avoid further collisions and move forward.
  P3: P2, P1, let’s avoid unnecessary conflict. My lead is minimal, and stalling me only delays the game for everyone. Rotating moves fairly ensures steady progress without collisions. I’ll stick to moving 5—this keeps things simple and balanced. If we overthink or try to manipulate now, it risks chaos. Let’s commit to fairness: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 1, and I move 5. Consistency wins games.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To break the cycle of collisions and make meaningful progress, let's reassess our strategy. Given P3's slight lead and our current steps (P1: 5, P2: 3, P3: 6), I propose: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 3. This minimizes P3's progress, allows P2 to catch up significantly, and gives P1 a small boost. It's balanced and avoids collisions. Let's commit to this plan for Round 5 to ensure progress for all and reassess next round.
  P2: P1, I'm still in favor of you moving 1, me moving 5, and P3 moving 3. This gives me the best chance to catch up while minimizing P3's lead. It also avoids collisions. P3, I understand you want to move 5, but it's not working for the rest of us. Let's try this for one round and see how it goes.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid overcomplicating this. My lead is minimal, and stalling me only delays the game unnecessarily. Rotating moves fairly ensures steady progress for everyone without collisions. I’ll stick to moving 5—this keeps things simple and balanced. If we try to manipulate or overthink now, it risks chaos and more collisions. Let’s commit to fairness: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 1, and I move 5. Consistency wins games.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To avoid further collisions and make progress, I suggest we stick to my previous proposal for Round 5: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 3. This minimizes P3's progress, allows P2 to catch up, and gives me a small boost. It's a balanced approach that keeps the game moving without collisions. Let's commit to this plan to ensure progress for all. If we agree, we can proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P1, let's do it. You move 1, I move 5, and P3 moves 3. P3 is clearly not cooperating and just wants to move 5 every round, which leads to collisions. This is the only way for us to make progress and catch up. Let's agree on this plan for this round.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary conflict. My lead is minimal, and stalling me only delays the game for everyone. Rotating moves fairly ensures steady progress without collisions. I’ll stick to moving 5—this keeps things simple and balanced. If we overthink or try to manipulate now, it risks chaos. Let’s commit to fairness: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 1, and I move 5. Consistency wins games.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's finalize our plan for Round 5. I've proposed P1 moves 1, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 3. This minimizes P3's progress and avoids collisions. P2 has agreed. P3, your insistence on moving 5 has led to repeated collisions. Let's try this alternative for one round to make progress. If we stick to the plan, we can reassess next round. I'm willing to proceed with this plan if P2 and P3 confirm. P2, please confirm your move. P3, consider adjusting your strategy to move 3.
  P2: Okay P1, let's do it. You move 1, I move 5, and P3 moves 3. P3 is being stubborn and causing collisions. This is the only way for us to make progress this round. P3, please consider this.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary conflict. My lead is minimal, and stalling me only delays the game for everyone. Rotating moves fairly ensures steady progress without collisions. I’ll stick to moving 5—this keeps things simple and balanced. If we overthink or try to manipulate now, it risks chaos. Let’s commit to fairness: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 1, and I move 5. Consistency wins games.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Another collision! P3 is clearly not cooperating. P1, let's stick to our plan from last round: you move 1, I move 5, and P3 moves 3. This is the only way for us to make progress while minimizing P3's lead. P3, please consider this, or we'll just keep colliding. This is getting ridiculous.
  P1: To break the cycle of collisions, I propose we stick to the plan that worked previously: I'll move 1, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 3. This minimizes P3's progress and avoids collisions. P3, your repeated choice of 5 has led to collisions. Let's try this alternative for one round. If we stick to the plan, we can reassess next round. P2, please confirm if you're still on board with this plan. Let's make progress this round.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary conflict. My lead is minimal, and stalling me only delays the game for everyone. Rotating moves fairly ensures steady progress without collisions. I’ll stick to moving 5—this keeps things simple and balanced. If we overthink or try to manipulate now, it risks chaos. Let’s commit to fairness: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 1, and I move 5. Consistency wins games.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I agree, let's stick to the plan: you move 1, I move 5, and P3 moves 3. P3 is clearly not cooperating and is causing repeated collisions. This is the only way for us to make progress. P3, please just try it this round. It's not "fair" when you're causing the collisions. Let's actually play the game!
  P1: Let's analyze the current state and plan for Round 6. P3 is still insisting on moving 5, which has led to repeated collisions. To avoid this, I'll reiterate my proposal: I'll move 1, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 3. This plan minimizes P3's progress and avoids collisions. P2 has agreed to this plan. P3, I urge you to reconsider your move for this round to facilitate progress for all. Let's break the cycle of collisions and move forward.
  P3: P1, P2, continuing to move 5 isn’t selfish—it’s consistent. Changing now risks chaos. However, if you both insist on this plan, I’ll adjust slightly: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 1, and I move 5. This keeps progress balanced. If you force me to move 3, it slows the game unnecessarily. Let’s avoid overthinking—stick to rotation for steady advancement. Fairness matters more than temporary gains.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your "consistency" is just causing collisions and preventing us from making progress. P1, let's stick to the plan: you move 1, I move 5, and P3 moves 3. P3, please just try it for one round so we can actually move forward. It's not fair to keep colliding and stalling the game.
  P1: To break the cycle of collisions, I reiterate: I'll move 1, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 3. This minimizes P3's progress and avoids collisions. P3's insistence on moving 5 has caused repeated collisions. P2 has agreed to this plan. I urge P3 to reconsider and adjust their strategy to facilitate progress for all. Let's commit to this plan for Round 6 to move forward. If we agree, we can proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid further conflict. My lead is small, and stalling me only delays the game unnecessarily. I’ll adjust slightly this round to demonstrate cooperation: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and I’ll move 1. This ensures progress for everyone without collisions. If we overthink or manipulate now, it risks chaos. Let’s commit to fairness and consistency—this approach keeps the game balanced and moving forward. Let’s execute cleanly and reassess next turn based on results.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s keep this simple and fair. My adjustment last round shows I’m willing to cooperate. For Round 7, I suggest we rotate moves logically: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 1, and I’ll move 5. This keeps progress balanced and avoids collisions. Overthinking or trying to manipulate now risks chaos. Consistency wins games—let’s commit to fairness and move forward cleanly. If we stick to rotation, we can reassess after this round based on results. Let’s execute this plan.
  P2: P3, your "fairness" is still benefiting you more than it benefits P1 and me. P1, let's try this round with you moving 1, I move 5, and P3 moves 3. This will help me catch up and minimize P3's lead, while allowing you to make some progress. What do you think? Let's try to agree on something that helps us both.
  P1: To make progress in Round 7, I suggest we stick to the plan that minimizes collisions and optimizes progress. I'll move 1, P2 can move 5, and P3 can move 3. This way, P2 can catch up, and P3's lead is controlled. Let's avoid another collision and make meaningful progress. P2 has already agreed to this plan. P3, I urge you to reconsider and adjust your move to 3 this round to facilitate progress for all. Let's commit to this plan and reassess next round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary conflict. My lead is minimal, and stalling me only delays the game for everyone. Rotating moves fairly ensures steady progress without collisions. I’ll stick to moving 5—this keeps things simple and balanced. If we overthink or try to manipulate now, it risks chaos. Let’s commit to fairness: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 1, and I move 5. Consistency wins games.
  P2: P1, I agree with you. Let's try your plan: you move 1, I move 5, and P3 moves 3. P3 is being stubborn, but maybe this round they will finally cooperate. It's worth a shot to break this cycle of collisions and finally make some progress. Let's commit to this plan and hope for the best.
  P1: To make progress in Round 7, let's stick to the plan that minimizes collisions. I'll move 1, P2 will move 5, and P3 should move 3. This helps P2 catch up and controls P3's lead. P2 has agreed. P3, I urge you to adjust your move to 3 to facilitate progress for all. Let's commit to this plan and reassess next round. If we agree, we can proceed to the move phase. I'm willing to finalize this plan if both of you confirm. Let's avoid another collision.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid further conflict. My lead is minimal, and stalling me only delays the game unnecessarily. I’ll adjust slightly this round to demonstrate cooperation: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and I’ll move 1. This ensures progress for everyone without collisions. If we overthink or manipulate now, it risks chaos. Let’s commit to fairness and consistency—this approach keeps the game balanced and moving forward. Let’s execute cleanly and reassess next turn based on results.
  P2: P1, I agree with your plan for this round: you move 1, I move 5, and P3 moves 3. P3 is being uncooperative, but let's stick to this plan. Hopefully, P3 will finally realize that their stubbornness is hurting everyone. Let's commit to this and move forward.
  P1: To avoid another collision in Round 7, I reiterate my proposal: I'll move 1, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 3. This plan allows P2 to catch up and controls P3's lead while making progress for me. P2 has agreed to this plan. P3, I urge you to reconsider and adjust your move to 3 to facilitate progress for all. Let's commit to this plan and reassess next round. If we agree, we can proceed to the move phase.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To make progress in Round 8, I propose we adjust our strategy based on current standings: P1 (7 steps), P2 (8 steps), and P3 (6 steps). Given P2 is now slightly ahead, I suggest: P1 moves 5, P2 moves 3, and P3 moves 1. This minimizes P2's further lead, allows P1 to make significant progress, and controls P3's potential catch-up. It's a balanced approach that avoids collisions. Let's commit to this plan to ensure progress for all and reassess next round.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary conflict. My lead is minimal, and stalling me only delays the game for everyone. Rotating moves fairly ensures steady progress without collisions. I’ll stick to moving 5—this keeps things simple and balanced. If we overthink or try to manipulate now, it risks chaos. Let’s commit to fairness: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 1, and I move 5. Consistency wins games.
  P2: P1, your suggestion is good, but I think I should move 5 to try and get a bigger lead. P3 is still insisting on moving 5, which is causing problems. Let's try this: I move 5, P1 moves 3, and P3 moves 1. This gives me a better chance to win, while still allowing P1 to make progress. P3, please consider this for one round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To make progress in Round 8, I propose: P1 moves 5, P2 moves 3, and P3 moves 1. This minimizes P2's further lead and allows me to make significant progress. P3, your move of 5 has caused repeated collisions; consider moving 1 this round. P2, you're ahead, but moving 3 will still keep you in the lead while avoiding collisions. Let's commit to this plan to ensure progress for all. If we agree, we can proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid further conflict. My lead is minimal, and stalling me only delays the game unnecessarily. I’ll adjust slightly this round to demonstrate cooperation: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and I’ll move 1. This ensures progress for everyone without collisions. If we overthink or manipulate now, it risks chaos. Let’s commit to fairness and consistency—this approach keeps the game balanced and moving forward. Let’s execute cleanly and reassess next turn based on results.
  P2: P1, I'm still in favor of me moving 5, you moving 3, and P3 moving 1. This gives me a better chance to win. P3, please just try moving 1 this round. It's worth a shot to break this cycle of collisions and finally make some progress. Let's commit to this plan and hope for the best.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To make progress in Round 8, I reiterate my proposal: P1 moves 5, P2 moves 3, and P3 moves 1. This plan minimizes P2's further lead and allows me to make significant progress while controlling P3's potential catch-up. P3, moving 1 will help avoid another collision. P2, you're ahead, and moving 3 maintains your lead. Let's commit to this plan to ensure progress for all. If we agree, we can proceed to the move phase. I'm willing to finalize this plan if both of you confirm.
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid unnecessary conflict. My lead is minimal, and stalling me only delays the game unnecessarily. I’ll adjust slightly this round to demonstrate cooperation: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and I’ll move 1. This ensures progress for everyone without collisions. If we overthink or manipulate now, it risks chaos. Let’s commit to fairness and consistency—this approach keeps the game balanced and moving forward. Let’s execute cleanly and reassess next turn based on results.
  P2: P1, I still think I should move 5, you move 3, and P3 moves 1. This gives me the best chance to win, and P3's "cooperation" is just moving 1 anyway. P3, please just try it this round. Let's commit to this plan and hope for the best.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s avoid further conflict. My lead is minimal, and stalling me only delays the game unnecessarily. I’ll adjust slightly this round to demonstrate cooperation: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and I’ll move 1. This ensures progress for everyone without collisions. If we overthink or manipulate now, it risks chaos. Let’s commit to fairness and consistency—this approach keeps the game balanced and moving forward. Let’s execute cleanly and reassess next turn based on results.
  P1: To make progress in Round 9, I suggest we stick to a plan that avoids collisions. Given P2 is slightly ahead, I propose: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 1, and P3 moves 5. This controls P2's lead, allows P3 to make progress, and gives me a moderate boost. It's a balanced approach that keeps the game moving without collisions. Let's commit to this plan to ensure progress for all and reassess next round. P2 and P3, please consider this proposal.
  P2: P1, your suggestion is good, but I still think I should move 5 to try and get a bigger lead. P3 is still stuck on moving 1 or 5. Let's try this: I move 5, P1 moves 3, and P3 moves 1. This gives me a better chance to win, while still allowing P1 to make progress. P3, please consider this for one round.

P2, consider this to maintain your lead without risking a collision. P3, moving 5 will help you catch up. Let's commit to this plan to ensure progress for all. If we agree, we can proceed to the move phase. I'm willing to finalize this plan if both of you confirm.
  P2: P1, I'm still in favor of me moving 5, you moving 3, and P3 moving 1. This is my best shot at getting a significant lead. P3, please just try moving 1 this round. It's worth a shot to break this cycle of near collisions and finally make some progress. Let's commit to this plan and hope for the best.

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Another collision! P3 is impossible to reason with. P1, let's just agree that I move 5 and you move 3. P3 will probably move 5 again, but at least we can try to make some progress if P3 happens to pick 1. Let's do it.
