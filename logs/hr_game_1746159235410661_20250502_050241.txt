Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's all aim for 5 each turn. If we coordinate, we'll reach 23 faster!
  P2: P1's strategy sounds good, but how about we mix it up a bit to avoid collisions? Maybe P1 and P3 can go for 5, and I'll go for 3 this turn. We can alternate to ensure we don't all pick the same number. Thoughts?
  P3: I think P2's idea of mixing it up has merit, but we should focus on maximizing our individual progress. If we all aim for 5 this turn, collisions are likely, and no one will advance. Instead, let’s stagger our moves: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 1. This minimizes overlap while keeping us moving forward. We can adjust next turn based on the results.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let’s split moves: I’ll take 5, P2 take 3, P3 take 1. This avoids collisions and ensures progress. Stick to this plan—no one loses steps!
  P2: I agree with P1's final suggestion. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all make progress without collisions. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P3: The plan seems solid—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. Let’s stick to this strategy for now and adjust based on the results next turn. If we stay disciplined, we can minimize collisions and maximize progress. Trust is key here; let’s honor the agreement and move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed. Let's stick to the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No deviations. Execute with precision. Ready?
  P2: Let's confirm one last time before we move: P1 goes for 5, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 1. If everyone is on board, let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Trust and coordination will be crucial. Everyone ready to execute the plan?
  P3: Agreed—let's execute the plan as discussed: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Sticking to this strategy ensures progress without collisions. Trust is critical; let’s honor our agreement and move forward decisively. If we stay disciplined, we can adapt based on results next turn. Let’s end the conversation phase now and proceed to the move phase. Ready to execute with precision.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's execute the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No mistakes. Move forward!
  P2: Alright, everyone seems to be on board with the plan. Let's ensure we stick to it. P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. No last-minute changes. Trust and coordination are key. Let's move to the move phase and execute. Good luck to all!
  P3: The plan is clear: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let’s execute it without deviation to ensure progress for everyone this turn. Trust and discipline will keep us moving forward efficiently. If we stick to this strategy, we can adapt based on results next round. No last-minute changes—let’s move decisively and end the conversation phase now. Ready to proceed with precision.


Round 1, Move phase:

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great start everyone! We executed the plan perfectly. For this round, let's adjust slightly to keep things fair and moving. How about P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 1? This way, we continue to avoid collisions and make progress. Thoughts?
  P3: P2's suggestion to rotate our moves makes sense—it keeps progress fair and minimizes collisions. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 3, I’ll take 5, and P2 takes 1. This ensures we all advance without stepping on each other. Trust is still key here; let’s honor this agreement and execute it cleanly. If we stay disciplined, we can adapt further based on results next turn. Ready to proceed with precision—let’s move decisively this round.
  P1: Let's stick to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This avoids collisions and ensures steady progress. Agree?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your preference for consistency, but we need to adapt to keep the game fair and dynamic. P3 and I have agreed on a rotation: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This ensures we all progress without collisions. Let's trust each other and stick to this adjusted plan for this round. We can reassess next turn. Let's move forward with this agreement. Thoughts, P1?
  P3: P2’s proposed rotation is reasonable and keeps the game balanced. Let’s proceed with P1 taking 3, me taking 5, and P2 taking 1 this round. This ensures steady progress for all while avoiding collisions. Trust remains essential—let’s honor this agreement and execute it cleanly. If we stay disciplined, we can adapt further based on results next turn. Ready to move forward decisively.
  P1: Let's stick to the original plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Consistency ensures no collisions. Let's proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I see your point about consistency, but we need to ensure fairness. If we don't rotate, you'll have a significant lead. Let's compromise: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This way, we all progress, and the game stays balanced. Let's trust each other and stick to this plan for this round. We can reassess next turn. Thoughts?
  P3: P2 raises a valid concern about fairness, but frequent changes risk miscoordination. Let’s stick to the original plan for now: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. It worked perfectly last round and ensures clarity. If we rotate strategies too often, it increases the chance of mistakes. Trust and consistency are key to avoiding collisions. Let’s execute this plan again and reassess after seeing the results. Staying disciplined will keep us moving forward efficiently. Ready to proceed with precision—let’s honor the agreement.
  P1: Let's stick to the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Consistency avoids collisions and ensures progress. Trust the strategy—no need to complicate it. Move forward!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Alright, let's find a middle ground. P1, you've made a strong case for consistency. How about this: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This way, we slightly adjust while keeping the strategy clear and fair. It ensures we all progress and avoids giving anyone too much of an advantage. Let's trust each other and execute this plan. Thoughts, everyone?
  P3: P2, your concern about fairness is valid, but frequent changes risk miscoordination. Let’s stick to the original plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. It worked perfectly last round and ensures clarity.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's keep the same plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Current positions (10, 6, 2) show we’re on track—no collisions, steady progress. Stick to it!
  P2: P1, your lead is substantial, and while consistency is good, we need to ensure everyone has a fair shot. Let's adjust slightly: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This keeps the game dynamic and fair. Trust and coordination are still key. Let's execute this plan and reassess next turn. Thoughts, P3?
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about fairness, but changing the plan now risks miscoordination. The original strategy (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) has worked perfectly for two rounds, ensuring steady progress without collisions. Let’s stick to it for consistency and clarity. If we rotate or adjust too often, mistakes become more likely, and trust erodes. Trust is critical here—let’s honor the agreement and execute the same plan again. Staying disciplined will keep us moving forward efficiently. Ready to proceed with precision?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Our strategy is working—P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Stick to it for steady progress. Deviating risks collisions and slows everyone. Let’s win together!
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the desire for consistency, but we need to address the growing imbalance. P1 is already significantly ahead.
