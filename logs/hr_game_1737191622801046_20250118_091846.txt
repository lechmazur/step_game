Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's each pick a different number this turn to get started. P1, how about you pick 1? P2, how about 3? I'll take 5.
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion. Let's each pick a different number. I'll go with 1, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we all advance. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I agree with the plan. I'll take 3 while P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5. That way we all make progress.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good to me.
  P1: Let's stick to our plan and ensure we all pick different numbers. It will give us a solid start. I'm still going with 1, P2 with 3, and P3 with 5. Any thoughts?
  P2: 


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Sounds like we have a plan. Let's move.
  P1: Let's finalize our plan. I’ll stick with 1, P2 will take 3, and P3 will take 5. This way, we all advance. Ready to move?
  P2: I agree, we're all set.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Sounds good. Let's move.
  P1: Let's finalize our choices. I'm going with 1, P2 with 3, and P3 with 5. Ready to move!

  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Well, that didn't go as planned. P1, why did you pick 5 when we agreed on 1? Let's actually stick to different numbers this time. How about P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5 again?
  P1: I understand the confusion, P3. Let's stick to our original plan this time. I’ll pick 1, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we all advance without colliding. Ready to move?
  P2: I already have 3 steps while you both have 0. Why should I help either of you advance? I suggest you both pick different numbers from what I choose, but I won't commit to any specific number yet.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, while you're ahead now, if we keep colliding, nobody wins. Let's coordinate to all move. P1, are you still willing to go with 1? If so, P2, how about 3 again, and I'll take 5?
  P1: P1: I see your point, P2. However, if we keep colliding, we'll all stay stuck. Let's stick to our plan: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all move forward. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I understand the desire to coordinate, but I'm in the lead and need to protect my advantage. I'll make my own choice without revealing it. Let's see what happens.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, if you keep refusing to coordinate, P1 and I might coordinate against you in future rounds. Let's all pick different numbers this round: P1 pick 1, you pick 3, and I'll pick 5.
  P1: P1: I understand, P2, but if we keep colliding, we'll all stay stuck. Let's agree to stick to our previous plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I'll continue to make my own strategic choice without revealing it. You two can coordinate if you wish, but I need to maintain my lead.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, let's coordinate. I'll pick 1, you pick 5. P2, you seem set on your own strategy.
  P1: P1: I see that P2 wants to maintain their lead, but if we keep colliding, none of us will progress. P3, how about we stick to our original plan: I take 1, you take 5, and let P2 take 3? This way, we can all advance. What do you think?
  P2: Since I'm in the lead, I'll continue with my own strategy without revealing it. You two can coordinate as you wish.
