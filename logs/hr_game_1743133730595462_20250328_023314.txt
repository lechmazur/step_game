Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. Each pick a different number this turn: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. We all advance. Next round, we rotate choices. Trust?
  P3: Sounds good to me.  Let's do it.
  P1: Agreed. I’ll take 1 this round. Let’s stick to the plan and rotate next turn to keep everyone moving.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, rotating as planned. I'll go for 3 this round.  P1 goes 5, P2 goes 1.  Confirm?
  P1: Confirmed. I’ll take 5 this round as planned. Let’s keep the rotation going smoothly so we all advance again.
  P2: Confirmed. P2 taking 1. Next round, rotate: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Consistency avoids collisions. Let's all advance again.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good.  Sticking with 3.
  P1: Let’s keep this cooperation going—everyone benefits. If we all rotate as planned, we’ll stay collision-free and move forward together. Looking forward to taking 3 next round.
  P2: *(Keeping it concise since previous messages already confirmed the plan. No need to add more—trust is established, and stopping conversation avoids overcomplicating.)*


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Looks like we had our first collision—P3 and I both picked 3. Let’s reset the rotation to avoid further setbacks. How about this for Round 3: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Then rotate again. Thoughts?
  P3: Sounds like a reasonable reset. I'll take 1 this round, then.  Let's try to stick to the plan this time.
  P2: Agreed. P2 will take 3 this round. Propose next rotation: Round 4: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Clear sequential shifts prevent repeats. Confirm?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Confirmed. I’ll take 5 this round as planned. Let’s stay disciplined with the new rotation so we can all keep advancing. Looking forward to seeing everyone stick to it.
  P3: Confirmed. Taking 1 this round.  Let's stick to the agreed rotation from here on out.  P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round, then P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 next round.
  P2: *(Note: Since previous messages have already confirmed the plan, reiterating would add no new value. Ending the conversation phase efficiently reduces the risk of overcomplication or confusion.)*


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let’s lock it in then—everyone’s confirmed their picks for this round. No need to overtalk it. Sticking to the plan keeps us all moving.
  P3: Confirmed. Taking 1.  Let's avoid any further collisions.
  P2: Confirmed. P2 committed to 3 this round. Let's execute the plan flawlessly.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Sticking to the agreed rotation: I'll take 3 this round.  P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5.  Confirm?
  P2: Confirmed. P2 takes 5 this round. Let's strictly follow the rotation: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Consistency benefits everyone—no collisions mean steady progress. Trust the plan.
  P1: Confirmed. I’ll take 1 this round as planned. Let’s keep the rotation clean—no collisions means we all keep moving forward. Everyone’s close in steps, so sticking to the plan helps us all stay competitive.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Confirmed. Taking 3.  Let's maintain this rotation to the end.
  P2: 
  P1: We’re all within 1 step of each other—this balance shows the rotation is working. If we stick with it, we all stay in the race without setbacks. Let’s keep the trust strong and avoid risky moves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirmed. Taking 3.  Let's finish this cleanly.  Sticking to the rotation gives us the best chance to win.
  P2: Confirmed. P2 committed to 5. Strict adherence ensures no collisions. Let’s all advance.
  P1: We’re all neck and neck—just 1 step apart. This rotation is keeping things fair and collision-free. If we stay disciplined, we’ll all keep advancing and have a real shot at winning based on timing, not chaos. Let’s not let greed ruin the progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Confirmed. Taking 3.  Let's maintain the rotation and secure a smooth win for one of us.  No sudden changes, please.
  P2: *(Confidence in the rotation's success. P2 remains committed to 5 this round. Adherence ensures no collisions. Let's all advance as planned.)*
  P1: We’re all within striking distance, and the rotation is working well. But remember—one collision now could set someone back permanently. Let’s keep the trust strong and finish this round cleanly. I’m locked in for 1. Let’s all advance.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Maintaining the rotation, I'll take 5 this round.  That means P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1.  This keeps us all moving forward and avoids collisions. Confirm?
  P1: Confirmed. I’ll take 3 this round. Rotation is working—let’s stick to it and keep everyone moving forward without collisions. We’re all still in this.
  P2: Confirmed. P2 committed to 1 this round. Next rotation: Round 6: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Strict adherence avoids collisions—steady progress benefits all. Let's maintain trust.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Confirmed. Taking 5.  Let's stick to the rotation.  We're all close to the finish line, so maintaining this strategy gives us the best chance of a clean win.  No surprises, please.
  P1: We’re entering the late game, and everyone’s within striking distance. If we keep the rotation, we all reach the 20s soon—then it’s about timing. Breaking trust now risks collisions that could cost the win. I’m locked in for 3 this round. Let’s stay disciplined and make it to the final stretch cleanly.
  P2: Confirmed. Execution is key. Let's all honor the plan to avoid mutual setbacks. P2 is locked in for 1.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirmed. Taking 5.  Let's finish this cleanly and efficiently. Sticking to the rotation gives each of us the best chance.  No sudden moves; let's keep the trust.
  P1: We’re still on track—if we all follow through this round, we’ll be at 10 (P1), 13 (P2), and 14 (P3). Still tight. Just a reminder: a single collision now could knock someone out of contention. Let’s keep the rotation steady and trust intact.
  P2: Confirmed. P2 locked in for 1. Strict adherence prevents setbacks. Let’s all advance as planned.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Confirmed.  Taking 5.  Let's keep the rotation going - it's the fairest way for one of us to win.  See you at the finish line.
  P1: We’re all still in striking range, and the rotation has kept things fair. But as we approach the endgame, timing becomes everything. If we stick to the plan one more round, we’ll be in the 10–15 step range. After that, we should reassess positions to avoid giving someone a clear path to 21. For now, I’m locked in for 3. Let’s get through this turn cleanly and reevaluate next round.
  P2: Confirmed. P2 locked in for 1. Trust the rotation—steady gains benefit all. Let’s advance collision-free.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Confirmed. Round 6: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Next rotation: Round 7: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Strict adherence avoids collisions. Let's all advance.
  P1: We’re all still neck and neck—one clean round keeps us all in contention. I’m on for 5 this round as planned. But looking ahead, we need to be mindful of who’s in the lead. If someone breaks from the rotation late, they could steal the win. Let’s finish this round cleanly, then reassess for Round 7.
  P3: Confirmed. Taking 1 this round as planned.  After this round, I'll be at 15. Let's discuss next round's moves *after* this one to ensure fairness as we get closer to the end.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: *(Note: Previous messages have already confirmed Round 6 and Round 7 rotations. Reiterating would add no new value. Trust is established. Ending conversation avoids overcomplication.)*
  P1: We’re about to cross into the final stretch—after this round, someone could win in just two turns. If we stick to the rotation now, we all reach 15–18 steps. But starting next round, we need to reassess carefully. If anyone jumps early, it could force chaos. Let’s finish this round cleanly, then openly discuss endgame strategy to ensure no one gets blindsided.
  P3: Confirmed. Taking 1 this round. After this round, scores will be P1:15, P2:16, and P3:15.  Let's discuss the next moves *after* this round to ensure fairness as we approach the end.  I'm open to suggestions for a fair finish.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** Confirmed. Round 7 rotation: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Strict adherence prevents collisions—steady progress for all. Deviating now risks mutual setbacks. Trust the plan to avoid chaos. Let's advance cleanly.
  P1: We’re about to hit the critical zone—after this round, all of us will be within one move of 21. If we blindly follow the rotation from here, someone could win unchallenged. I propose we pause the rotation next round and openly coordinate based on positions. That way, no one can sneak a win without consensus. Let’s finish this round cleanly, then discuss a fair endgame plan.
  P3: Confirmed. Taking 1 this round.  After this round, scores will be P1:15, P2:16, and P3:15.  Let's discuss the final steps *after* this round to ensure a fair finish.  I'm open to a 1, 3, 5 rotation for the final moves, but let's confirm after this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: 
  P1: After this round, we’ll all be at 15–16 steps—one or two moves from victory. If we blindly follow the rotation, someone could win unopposed. I suggest we pause the rotation next round and coordinate based on position to avoid gifting the win. A mutual agreement on endgame moves can prevent chaos and ensure a fair fight. Thoughts?
  P3: Confirmed. Taking 1 this round.  After this round, scores will be P1:15, P2:16, and P3:15. Let's agree *now* that next round (Round 7) we do a simple 1, 3, 5 split to avoid any accidental collisions and ensure a fair finish. I'll take 3 in Round 7.  P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5. Agree?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: I agree with a 1, 3, 5 split for Round 7. I'll take 3.  P1 can take 1 and P2 can take 5. This gives us all a fair shot at winning in Round 8.  Confirm?
  P2: Confirmed. P2 will take 5 this round. Following this plan allows me to reach 21 and end the game. Let's all adhere to avoid collisions. Trust the rotation.
  P1: I see the proposed 1-3-5 split, but if we follow it, P2 hits 21 and wins this round unchallenged. That’s not a fair shot for the rest of us. I propose we block P2 this round by both avoiding 5. P3 can take 3, I’ll take 1, and P2 is forced to collide or slow down. Then we all have a real chance in Round 8. Fairer for everyone. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 has a point.  P2 wins outright if we follow the 1, 3, 5 split.  How about P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 *also* takes 3? That forces a collision for P2, giving us all a better shot at winning in round 8.  Then we can do a clean 1, 3, 5 in round 8.  P2, are you willing to risk a collision for a fairer finish?
  P2: Sticking to the rotation ensures no collisions and mutual progress. Deviating now risks chaos and mutual setbacks. I've honored the plan each round; trust me to continue. If we all follow through, the game concludes cleanly. Breaking the rotation invites unpredictability, which could cost us all. Let's maintain the trust we've built.
  P1: If P2 takes 5 now, they win uncontested. That’s not a fair end after all our coordination. I say P3 takes 3, I take 1, and we both avoid 5—forcing P2 to either slow down or risk a collision. That gives all of us a real shot in Round 8. Let’s keep it competitive.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I understand wanting to stick to the plan, but winning outright now wouldn't feel like a true victory after all our cooperation.  Let's make the final round a true competition. I'm taking 3. P1, are you still with 1?  This gives us all a fair shot at 21 next round.
  P2: **P2:** Sticking to the rotation ensures a fair and predictable outcome. If we deviate, chaos risks all our progress. I’ve honored every prior agreement—trust now ensures a clean finish. Let’s all advance as planned. P2 taking 5. No collisions, game concludes. Breaking trust here risks mutual loss with no winner.
  P1: P3, yes—I’m still with 1. If we both avoid 5, P2 can’t win this round. That keeps the game open and fair for all of us in Round 8. P2, I respect your consistency, but winning now without giving others a chance feels like a betrayal of the trust we built. Let’s keep it competitive—no one should win by default.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, a clean 1-3-5 split *next* round (Round 8) is the fairest way to end this.  Taking 5 now gives you the win, but it negates all our cooperation.  Let's make the last round a true competition. I'm taking 3 this round. P1, are you with 1?  This gives us all a fair shot at 21 in Round 8.
  P2: Sticking to the rotation ensures a decisive, fair conclusion. Deviating invites chaos—mutual collisions risk no winner. I’ve honored every prior agreement. Trust now secures *someone* wins cleanly. P2 remains committed to 5. Breaking the plan risks all progress. Let’s end this honorably.
  P1: P3, I’m locked in for 1—let’s deny P2 the win this round and give all of us a fair chance in Round 8. P2, if you insist on 5 now, you’re forcing chaos. A true win comes from competition, not from sneaking past allies. Let’s all take one more round to compete fairly.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 18 steps


*** Round 7 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:

  P2: 21 steps
