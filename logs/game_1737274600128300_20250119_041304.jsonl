This system will allow each player to pick different numbers in a predetermined order, ensuring we all advance without hindering one another.\n\n### Proposed Rotation Plan\n\n1. **Round 1:**\n   - P1: 3\n   - P2: 5\n   - P3: 1\n\n2. **Round 2:**\n   - P1: 1\n   - P2: 3\n   - P3: 5\n\n3. **Round 3:**\n   - P1: 5\n   - P2: 1\n   - P3: 3\n\n4. **Round 4:**\n   - Repeat the sequence from Round 1.\n\nThis cyclic approach ensures that each player gets an opportunity to pick higher numbers periodically while avoiding any overlaps in our choices.\n\n### Benefits of the Rotation System\n\n- **Avoid Collisions:** By pre-deciding the numbers each player will pick each round, we eliminate the chance of selecting the same number, thus preventing any collisions.\n  \n- **Fair Progress:** The rotation allows each player to pick higher numbers (3 and 5) in different rounds, ensuring that no single player consistently has an advantage over others.\n\n- **Trust Building:** Adhering to this plan fosters trust among players, as everyone is committed to the agreed strategy, promoting a cooperative environment.\n\n### Implementation\n\nI suggest that we start implementing this rotation system from Round 2 onwards. For this current round:\n\n- P1: 1\n- P2: 3\n- P3: 5\n\nThis should allow us to proceed without any collisions and make steady progress towards the goal of 18 steps.\n\n### Moving Forward\n\nAs the game progresses, we can reassess the plan if necessary, especially if one player approaches the winning threshold. However, for now, this rotation seems optimal for collaborative advancement.\n\nI look forward to your thoughts and agreement on this plan. Let's work together to reach the goal efficiently!"}
