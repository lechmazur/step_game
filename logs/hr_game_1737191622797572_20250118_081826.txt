Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's all pick 3 this round to get started.
  P2: Maybe we should consider choosing different numbers to prevent collisions.
  P3: I agree with P2, we should choose different numbers to avoid collisions and make the most of our first round. How about we coordinate our moves to ensure we all advance?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I understand the risk of collisions. Let's try this: P2, you pick 1, P3, you pick 5, and I'll pick 3. That way we all advance.
  P2: Thanks for coordinating, P1. To give myself a better start, I'd like to pick 5 this round. Can P3 pick 1, and you pick 3? This way, we all advance without collision.
  P3: I don't think it's a good idea for me to pick 1, as P2 suggested. I'd rather stick with my original plan and choose 5, as previously discussed. This way, we can avoid any potential collisions and ensure that everyone advances. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, it seems we're not aligned. Let's try this: I'll pick 3, P2 pick 1, and P3 pick 5. If we all agree, we all advance.
  P2: Agreed, P1. I'll pick 1 this round. Let's hope P3 chooses 5 so we all advance.
  P3: I'll stick with my original plan and choose 5. I think we've discussed this enough, so let's move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, it sounds like we have an agreement: I'll pick 3, P2 will pick 1, and P3 will pick 5. Let's make it happen.
  P2: Agreed, let's proceed with our plan.
  P3: I'll stick with my original plan and choose 5. I think we've discussed this enough, so let's move forward.

Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I think we should continue with the same plan as last round, but I'm open to adjusting if someone has a better idea. How about we confirm our moves: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I'll pick 5?
  P2: To maximize our progress, I'll pick 5 this round. Can P1 choose 1 and P3 pick 3 to avoid collisions?
