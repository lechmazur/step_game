Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Let's coordinate so we all advance. I'll pick <move>1</move> this round. If we all choose different moves, we can avoid collisions and make progress. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your plan to coordinate sounds reasonable, but I think we should aim for a more aggressive strategy. Choosing higher numbers like <move>3</move> or <move>5</move> will help us progress faster. If we all pick different moves this round, we can avoid collisions and still make significant progress. I suggest we each commit to a distinct move: you take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. What do you say, P2?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: It seems like we had a collision last round, so let's try to avoid that this time. How about this: I'll stick with <move>1</move>, P2 can take <move>3</move>, and P1 can go with <move>5</move>. This way, we all make progress without stepping on each other's toes. What do you both think?
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, your coordination plan is solid, but I want to ensure we all stick to it this time. P2 seems silent, which makes me cautious—silence often means unpredictability. If P2 doesn’t commit verbally, they might disrupt again. To guarantee progress, let’s confirm roles clearly: you take <move>1</move>, I’ll take <move>5</move>, and P2 must explicitly agree to <move>3</move>. If P2 won’t respond or cooperate, we should consider alternative strategies. What do you think, P2?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, it seems P2 is still unresponsive, which increases the risk of another collision. To minimize uncertainty, let’s stick to distinct moves again: you take <move>1</move>, I’ll take <move>5</move>, and we’ll assume P2 will pick <move>3</move>. If P2 disrupts again, we may need to adjust our strategy dynamically in the next round. For now, let’s proceed cautiously but decisively. Do you agree with this plan?
  P3: P1, your plan seems reasonable, but it hasn't worked out so far. P2's silence is unpredictable, and we can't rely on them to pick <move>3</move>. To avoid collisions, I'll choose <move>5</move> this time, hoping P2 sticks with <move>3</move>. P1, maybe you could try <move>1</move> to ensure someone advances. Let's adapt and see if this switch helps us progress.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, it seems like P2 is sticking to their silence strategy, which makes things tricky. Since we need to adapt, I'll choose <move>3</move> this time. If you pick <move>5</move>, we can both advance. P2 might pick <move>1</move> again, but if they pick <move>3</move>, we’ll still make some progress. Let's try this approach and see if it helps us both. What do you think?
  P1: P3, your adjustment to <move>3</move> makes sense given P2's unpredictable behavior. However, if P2 picks <move>3</move> again, it could block you. To maximize our chances, I’ll take <move>5</move> as planned. If P2 chooses <move>1</move>, we both advance without issue. Let’s proceed with this plan and adapt further based on their actions. Consistency is key—if we stick to distinct moves, we can outpace P2 over time.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, I understand your point about consistency, but given P2's unpredictability, it's risky. I'll stick with <move>3</move> this round, hoping P2 chooses <move>1</move> again. If P2 disrupts, we might need a backup plan. Let's see how this plays out and adjust if needed. Good luck!
  P1: P3, I agree that P2’s silence is a challenge, but sticking to distinct moves remains our best strategy. I’ll take <move>5</move> as planned. If P2 picks <move>1</move>, we both advance. If they disrupt again, we’ll adapt in the next round. Let’s remain flexible and focused—our consistency will eventually outpace P2’s unpredictability. Trust in our coordination, and let’s push forward decisively.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, P2’s continued silence and erratic moves are complicating things, but we can still outpace them. Let’s stick to distinct moves: you take <move>1</move>, I’ll take <move>3</move>, and we’ll assume P2 might pick <move>5</move>. If P2 disrupts again, we adapt next round. Consistency and coordination will eventually leave them behind. Trust in our strategy, and let’s push forward decisively. What do you say?
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, I understand your strategy, but given P2's unpredictable moves, we might need to adapt more dynamically. I'll choose <move>5</move> this round, hoping P2 sticks with <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>. If you go with <move>3</move>, we can potentially avoid a collision. Let’s see if this change helps us make progress. P2, your silence is making things tricky, so any input would be helpful. Let's try to move forward efficiently.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your willingness to adapt is smart, but I’m sticking with <move>3</move> as planned. If P2 picks <move>1</move>, we both advance without issue. If they disrupt again, we’ll adjust dynamically next round. Trust in our coordination—consistency will eventually outpace P2’s unpredictability. Let’s stay focused and decisive. Good luck!
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, I understand your plan, but given P2's unpredictability, let's be flexible. I'll stick with <move>5</move> this round, hoping P2 picks <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>. If you choose <move>3</move>, we might avoid a collision and both advance. P2, your input would be valuable; any coordination could help us all progress. Let's try to adapt and move forward effectively.

  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, given P2's lack of communication and unpredictable moves, we need to adapt strategically. I'll choose <move>1</move> this round, assuming P2 might pick <move>5</move> again. If you go with <move>3</move>, we can potentially avoid collisions and both advance. P2, if you have any strategy or input, it would be helpful to know. Let's try to coordinate and make progress efficiently.
  P1: P3, your shift to <move>1</move> is a solid adjustment, and I’ll stick with <move>3</move> as planned. If P2 picks <move>5</move> again, we both advance without issue. P2’s silence continues to be a wildcard, but our consistent coordination will eventually outpace their erratic moves. Let’s remain adaptable and focused—our teamwork and strategic choices will secure the win. Trust in our plan, and let’s push forward decisively. Good luck!

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, our coordination is working—let’s keep it up. I’ll take <move>5</move> this round to push ahead decisively. If you stick with <move>1</move>, and P2 continues their silence and picks <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, we can both advance without collisions. P2, your lack of communication leaves us guessing, but we’re committed to consistency. Let’s stay focused, P3—our teamwork will outpace P2’s unpredictability. Trust in the plan, and let’s secure the win together. Good luck!
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, I appreciate your plan, but given P2's unpredictability, we need to ensure progress. I'll stick with <move>1</move> this round, hoping P2 picks <move>3</move> or <move>5</move> again.

Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, sticking with <move>1</move> is a safe choice, but I’m taking <move>5</move> to maximize my lead. If P2 picks <move>3</move>, we both advance without collisions. P2’s silence continues to be a wildcard, but our consistent coordination will outpace their erratic moves. Let’s stay adaptable and focused—our teamwork will secure the win. Trust in the plan, and let’s push forward decisively. Good luck!
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, your strategy makes sense, but I’m considering a shift. I'll take <move>3</move> this round, hoping P2 chooses <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>.
