Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Let's start with a clean slate and see how we can navigate this game. I suggest we try to avoid collisions in the first few rounds to gain some initial progress. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: <stop>


Round 1, Move phase:

  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: It seems P1 and P2 are on the same page, but let's try to coordinate a bit more. I suggest we spread out our moves this round: P1, go for 1; P2, go for 3; and I'll take 5. This way, we can all make some progress without colliding. What do you think?
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Move phase:

This should help us avoid any collisions and allow us to make progress. Let's try to stick to this plan and see if we can advance smoothly. What do you think?
  P2: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
