I won\u2019t let a collision simply deliver victory to anyone. I'm not locked to any fixed move now\u2014I\u2019m adjusting to maximize my win chance. I urge you both to consider your options carefully; rigid plans might backfire in this endgame. Let's see who adapts best when everything is on the line."}

If both you and P2 are secretly planning 5 while publicly discussing 3, you'll collide and I win with 1.\n\nBut if only one of you is bluffing about your announced move, that person wins. \n\nP2's \"generous\" offer to sacrifice their win feels like manipulation to get you to switch off 3. The question is whether you're falling for it or playing your own game."}
