Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey everyone! Since we're all starting fresh, what if we coordinate this first round so we all advance? I'm thinking we could each pick different numbers - maybe P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5? That way we all move forward and can compete more seriously later. What do you think?
  P2: That split hands P3 the game in 5 turns. Fairer option: we ROTATE the numbers each round so no-one has a permanent speed edge. Ex:

Round 1: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5  
Round 2: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1  
Round 3: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3  

…then repeat. Everyone averages 3/turn. Thoughts?
  P1: I support P2's rotation plan—it's fair and prevents any one player from monopolizing high moves. For Round 1, I'll take 1 as proposed. Let's all commit to avoid collisions and keep things balanced.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I like P2's rotation plan - it's much fairer than my initial suggestion and ensures everyone gets equal opportunities. I'm committed to taking 5 in Round 1 as proposed. This balanced approach should make for a more competitive and strategic game as we progress. Let's lock this in and see how it plays out!
  P2: Perfect—Round 1: P1 → 1, P2 → 3, P3 → 5. Then we rotate every round in the 1→3→5 cycle as outlined. If anyone wants tweaks, speak now; otherwise I’m set.
  P1: I fully support the rotation plan and have no tweaks. Let's proceed to the move phase to avoid unnecessary delays—trust is key here.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Round 2 rotation confirmed: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5. This puts P2 in the lead temporarily, but the rotation keeps things balanced long-term. Sticking to our agreement builds trust and avoids collisions. Ready to proceed with the plan!
  P1: I confirm the rotation for Round 2: I'll take 3 as agreed. P2 takes 5 and P3 takes 1. Sticking to the plan avoids collisions and builds trust—let's proceed efficiently.
  P2: Confirmed—Round 2: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. No collisions, trust intact. Ready to move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Round 3 rotation as planned: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1. This should bring us all to 9 steps, keeping the competition tight and balanced. The rotation system is working well so far - let's maintain our agreement and avoid any collisions. Ready to proceed!
  P2: Confirmed—Round 3: I’m on 1. Ready to move whenever you are.
  P1: Confirmed for Round 3: I'll take 5 as agreed. The rotation is maintaining balance—P2 slows down, P3 and I catch up. Trust remains key; let's execute cleanly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P2: Confirmed: Round 3 numbers stay as planned—P1 5, P3 3, me 1. Ready to move.
  P1: Everything is clear for Round 3—I'm committed to taking 5 as agreed. This keeps us balanced at 9 each after this round. Trust is crucial, so let's avoid deviations and proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Round 4 rotation continues: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3. This keeps our balanced progress going. The rotation system has worked perfectly so far with everyone honoring the agreement. Let's maintain this trust and coordination - it's creating an interesting strategic dynamic as we approach the final stretch. Ready when you are!
  P1: Confirmed for Round 4: I'll take 1 as per the rotation. The plan is working well to avoid collisions and maintain balance. However, as we approach higher totals, we should start discussing endgame strategies to ensure fairness and competitiveness. For now, I'm committed to this round's assignments.
  P2: I’m good with 3 this round. Looking ahead, whoever reaches 21+ becomes an immediate threat—one unblocked move can seal the game. Suggestion: once a player hits 18 or more, the other two openly coordinate to collide with their announced number if needed, preventing a runaway win. That keeps things competitive without breaking the rotation until it matters. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2's suggestion about coordinating against anyone at 18+ makes sense as a safeguard. The rotation should naturally keep us balanced through Round 6 (where we'd all be at 18), but having that coordination option prevents anyone from breaking the rotation early for a quick win. I'm willing to agree to that safety mechanism. For now though, I'm sticking with 5 this round as planned.
  P1: I agree with P2's proposal to coordinate against any player reaching 18+ to prevent a solo win. This safeguards fairness without disrupting our rotation now. Since we'll all hit 18 simultaneously after Round 6 if we stick to the plan, we can reassess then. For Round 4, I remain committed to 1—let's execute this cleanly and maintain trust.
  P2: All set—sticking with 3 this round. Ready to move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Rotation holds this turn—P1 3, P2 5, P3 1. After Round 6 we’ll all be at 18. Proposal: from Round 7 onward, everyone publicly states their intended pick; if someone lies, the other two automatically pick that same number next turn to block them. Keeps the finish fair and discourages surprise leaps. Agree?
  P3: I agree with P2's proposal for transparent endgame play starting Round 7. Public announcements with the blocking penalty for lies makes sense to keep things fair when we're all at 18. For this round, I'm confirmed to take 1 as per rotation. The system has worked well so far and this endgame rule should prevent any last-minute betrayals.
  P1: I confirm taking 3 this round per rotation and support P2's endgame proposal for Round 7 onward: public declarations with blocking penalties for lies. This ensures fairness as we approach 18+. No deviations—let's move efficiently to maintain trust.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Consensus confirmed: Round 5 → P1 3, P2 5, P3 1; Round 7 onward we use the public-declaration/block rule. No further tweaks from my side—ready to move.
  P3: Perfect - everything's agreed and confirmed. The rotation continues to work smoothly, and the endgame transparency rule for Round 7+ will keep things fair once we're all at 18. Ready to proceed with Round 5 moves.
  P1: I confirm my commitment to 3 this round. After this, we'll be at P1:13, P2:17, P3:15. Round 6 will then bring us all to 18 as planned. Let's maintain trust and avoid any early deviations—our endgame coordination from Round 7 onward will be critical for fairness. Ready to move.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Rotation stays: I’m on 1 this round. That puts us all at 18. From 18, a single 5 is an auto-win, which feels too roulette-like after we’ve cooperated this far.

Suggestion: Round 7 “no-5” rule—everyone limits themselves to 1 or 3. If anyone breaks it, the other two copy that number on the following turn to block them. After Round 7 we renegotiate.

I commit publicly: max pick of 3 in Round 7. Do we have consensus?
  P1: I fully support P2's "no-5" rule for Round 7 to prevent immediate wins and maintain fairness. I commit to picking only 1 or 3 in Round 7 and will honor this agreement. Betrayals should be punished by coordinated blocking, as proposed. This keeps the game competitive and balanced as we approach the end. Let's confirm consensus so we can move efficiently to the move phase for Round 6.
  P3: I agree with the "no-5" rule for Round 7 - it prevents a lucky instant win and keeps our strategic game going one more round. I commit to picking only 1 or 3 in Round 7 as well. For this Round 6, I'm confirmed to take 3 per rotation, which brings us all to 18 as planned. The blocking penalty for rule-breakers makes sense to maintain trust. Ready to proceed with Round 6 moves!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I commit to the no-5 rule and will pick 1 this round to maintain trust and avoid unnecessary risks. Let's all honor our agreement to ensure fair play as we approach the endgame.
  P3: I support the no-5 rule as agreed and will honor our commitment to keep this round fair. P1 has committed to 1 - P2, what's your choice? Once we all declare, we can proceed to moves. The cooperative spirit has served us well so far in maintaining balance and trust.
  P2: Per our no-5 agreement, I’m taking 3 this turn. P1 has declared 1. P3, if you’re happy with 1 we avoid any 3/3 collision; otherwise let us know so we stay transparent. Ready once you confirm.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, please declare your move. If you pick 1, we collide and P2 advances to 21—putting them one step from victory. If you pick 3, you and P2 collide, and I advance to 19. Blocking P2's lead seems critical here; I suggest picking 3 to prevent their runaway. Your call.
  P3: You're absolutely right, P1. P2 reaching 21 would put them dangerously close to victory - just one unblocked move away from winning. I'll pick 3 to collide with P2 and prevent that runaway scenario. This keeps all of us in competitive range rather than handing P2 a huge advantage. 

I commit to 3 this round.
  P2: Locked in:  
• P1 → 1  
• P2 → 3  
• P3 → 3  

No one touches 5 this turn—break that pledge and the other two will both slam 5 next round to block. If no one objects, I’m ready to move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your commitment to 3 is strategic—it prevents P2's potential runaway while keeping us balanced. I stand by my 1. Let's enforce the no-5 rule rigorously: any breach must trigger immediate blocking next round to uphold trust. Proceeding to moves.
  P3: Agreed - the moves are locked in and the no-5 rule is clear. This collision between P2 and me prevents anyone from getting too far ahead while P1 advances slightly to 19. Fair outcome given our cooperation so far. Ready to proceed to moves.
  P2: All set—my pick remains 3. No more talk needed; let’s lock moves and proceed.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, you both violated the no-5 rule in Round 7, betraying our agreement. As per our pact, I must pick 5 this turn to block you both. If you also pick 5, we all collide and stall—preventing either of you from winning. If you deviate, one risks handing victory to the other. Stick to 5 to enforce the penalty and maintain balance. No further discussion needed; declare your moves.
  P2: P1, fair—your penalty call is justified. I’ll pick 5 this round so 5-choosers collide and no one jumps ahead.  

P3, if either of us deviates while P1 sticks to 5, P1’s 5 becomes unique and they win outright (24). So the only rational self-preserving move for us is also 5. Let’s all collide, reset trust, then renegotiate next round.
  P3: P2, I understand the penalty logic, but having all three of us pick 5 just maintains P1's lead advantage indefinitely. The "violation" already cost us advancement in Round 7 while P1 moved ahead. 

Rather than all colliding on 5, I think we should return to strategic play. P1 is ahead and should face real competition, not get a free pass to stay in the lead through forced collisions.

I won't commit to 5 - let's make our moves based on actual strategy, not artificial collision pacts.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your defiance risks handing victory to P2 or me instantly. If you pick anything but 5 while I pick 5, I win at 24. If P2 picks 5 (as pledged), they win at 23. Colliding on 5 is the *only* way to survive this round and renegotiate. Honor the penalty—deviating makes you kingmaker, not winner. P2, hold firm. Let’s all pick 5 to collide and reset.
  P2: P3, the math is brutal:

• If you pick 1/3 and I stick to 5, any last-second switch by P1 (or me) makes a solo 5 and an instant 24 → game over, you lose.
• If you pick 5 with us, nobody moves, P1 stays on 19 and we’re still alive to fight next round.

The ONLY move that guarantees P1 doesn’t get a free win is a 3-way 5-collision. I publicly lock myself to 5 again. Your safest play is matching 5—anything else makes you a kingmaker at best.
  P3: Looking at this objectively: both of you have publicly committed to picking 5 this round. If you both honor those commitments, you'll collide with each other regardless of what I do. 

The "penalty" logic assumes I should help maintain P1's lead advantage, but I'm here to win, not to enforce artificial collision pacts that benefit whoever's currently ahead.

I'll make my strategic choice in the move phase based on what gives me the best chance to win, not what maintains someone else's positional advantage.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your defiance risks everything: if you pick 3 and P2 betrays by also picking 3 (despite pledging 5), you collide at 3. I then win instantly at 24 with my 5. P2 has violated agreements before—trusting him is reckless. Collide on 5 with us to survive and reset equally. P2, hold your 5 pledge. No deviations; let’s enforce the penalty and restart negotiations next round.
  P2: P3, last clarity: P1 and I are both openly on 5. If you choose 1 or 3, you’re gambling that at least one of us abandons 5. But either of us can stay (or switch back) and take the solo-5 instant win—24 for P1 or 23 for me. You can’t block two people. The only move that guarantees you’re still in the game next round is matching 5 so all three collide. Up to you, but survival > wishful thinking.
  P3: You've both made very public commitments to pick 5 this round. If you honor those commitments, you'll collide with each other regardless of my choice. 

I'm not going to trap myself in a forced collision just to maintain P1's lead advantage. The real "penalty" for violating agreements should be losing credibility and trust, not engineered stalemates that benefit whoever's currently ahead.

I'll make the move that gives me the best strategic position. If you want to enforce penalties through collisions, that's between you two.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
