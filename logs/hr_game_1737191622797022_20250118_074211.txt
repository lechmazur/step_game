Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's all pick different numbers this round.
  P2: I agree with P3. To avoid collisions, I'll take 3 if someone else commits to 1 and 5.
  P1: I'll take 1 if P2 sticks to 3 and P3 takes 5, avoiding collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, I'll take 5 then.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 3 as discussed. Let's stick to this plan and all advance.
  P1: Let's review our plan: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. If everyone sticks to this, we all advance. Shall we proceed as agreed?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try to avoid collisions again. P3, since you're ahead, taking 5 might not be the best strategy for you this round. How about you take 1, I'll take 3, and P2 can take 5?
  P3: P1, I'm not changing my move, I'll stick with 5. P2, what are you going to do?
  P2: Since P3 is already ahead and insists on 5, I suggest P1 and I coordinate to avoid both P3 and each other. P1, would you be willing to take 1 while I take 3 again?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see P3 is sticking with 5. P2, if you take 3, I'll take 1 as you suggested, but if you betray this plan, I'll adjust my strategy accordingly in the next round. P3, are you sure you won't reconsider to avoid a potential collision with no progress?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with 5. You two coordinate as you see fit.
  P2: I'll confirm my commitment to take 3 while P1 takes 1. This way at least we both advance, since P3 seems determined to take 5.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, let's stick to our plan: you take 3, I'll take 1. P3, you're aware that taking 5 might not yield progress for you if we coordinate.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm still sticking with 5.
  P2: I maintain my commitment to take 3 while P1 takes 1. P3, you're taking a risk with 5, but that's your choice.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, given the current standings, it seems P3 is pulling ahead. To avoid collisions and make progress, how about P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5 this round? This way, we all advance and the gap doesn't widen too much.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with 5. You two coordinate as you see fit.
  P2: Since P3 is clearly sticking to their 5-strategy despite being ahead, P1 let's coordinate again. I'll take 3 if you take 1, allowing us both to catch up while P3 takes their risky 5.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, since P3 is determined to take 5, let's stick with our previous coordination: you take 3 and I'll take 1. This ensures we both advance while P3's progress is halted due to potential collision. P3, consider the risk of not advancing if we coordinate against your 5.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm still taking 5.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 3 again while P1 takes 1. P3, you're still in the lead but your insistence on 5 might backfire if we maintain our coordination.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, considering P3's significant lead, it's crucial we don't let them advance further. P2, since you're in the best position to challenge P3, I suggest you take 5 this round. I'll take 1, and hopefully, P3 will stick to their usual 5, causing a collision and halting their progress. This gives us a chance to catch up. P3, are you willing to risk not advancing by sticking to 5 again?
  P2: I understand P1's suggestion, but I'm not convinced taking 5 is my best move. P3, you're getting close to winning - are you really going to stick with 5 again? If so, P1's coordination plan makes sense.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, since P3 is sticking with 5, let's execute the plan I suggested: you take 5, I'll take 1. This is our chance to halt P3's progress and catch up. P3, you're risking not advancing by insisting on 5.
  P2: I'll stick with my proven strategy of taking 3. P1, if you take 1, we can both advance while P3's insistence on 5 will only hurt them. Let's continue our successful coordination.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm still taking 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, considering P3's lead and insistence on 5, I urge you to reconsider taking 5 this round to cause a collision and halt P3's progress. If not, our previous coordination of you taking 3 and me taking 1 still allows us to advance while P3 risks not moving. P3, your strategy is risky and might cost you the lead.
  P2: I'll maintain my commitment to take 3. P1, let's continue our successful coordination with you taking 1. P3's insistence on 5 will only hurt their progress.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm still taking 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, it's crucial we stop P3's lead. I suggest we both take 5 to collide with P3, halting their progress. If not, our usual coordination might not be enough to catch up. P3, your insistence on 5 is risky and could cost you the game.
  P2: I maintain my commitment to take 3. P1, your suggestion to take 5 is risky - if we continue our proven 1-3 coordination, we're guaranteed to advance while P3's insistence on 5 will hurt them. Let's stick to what works.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm still taking 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2, since P3 is sticking with 5, let's finally cause a collision to halt their progress. I'll take 5. If you also take 5, we can ensure P3 doesn't advance this round. P3, your insistence on 5 is about to backfire.
  P2: I'll maintain my commitment to take 3. P1, changing our successful coordination now is risky - let's stick to what works.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm still taking 5.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given P3's significant lead, I suggest P2 and I coordinate to take 5, causing a collision with P3 and halting their progress. P2, will you take 5 this round to give us a chance to catch up?
  P2: I understand the urgency to stop P3, but our 1-3 coordination has been consistently successful. P1, I suggest we stick to what works - I'll take 3 if you take 1. P3, you're close to winning but your 5-strategy remains risky.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm still taking 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, considering P3's lead, I strongly suggest we change our strategy this round. If we both take 5, we can cause a collision with P3, halting their progress and giving us a chance to catch up. Sticking to our previous coordination might not be enough at this point. P3, your insistence on 5 is risky and could backfire if we coordinate against you.
  P2: I'll maintain my commitment to take 3. P1, our consistent coordination has helped us make steady progress - let's not risk that now. P3's insistence on 5 will continue to work against them.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm still taking 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, since P3 is close to winning and insists on taking 5, I propose we both take 5 to collide with P3 and halt their progress. This is our last chance to catch up. P3, your 5-strategy is about to backfire if we coordinate against you.
  P2: I maintain my position to take 3. P1, changing our successful coordination now is too risky - let's stick to what works. P3's lead isn't insurmountable if we keep advancing steadily.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm still taking 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, it's crucial we stop P3 now. I'll take 5, and I urge you to do the same to cause a collision and halt P3's progress. If not, P3 will likely win this round. P3, your 5-strategy is on the verge of backfiring if we coordinate against you.
  P2: I maintain my commitment to take 3. P1, changing our proven strategy now could hurt us both - let's stick to what works. P3's lead isn't insurmountable with steady progress.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm still taking 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2, it's our last chance to stop P3. I'll take 5, and I urge you to do the same. If not, P3 will win. P3, your strategy will backfire if we coordinate against you.
  P2: I maintain my commitment to take 3. P1, our steady coordination has worked well - changing now is too risky.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm still taking 5.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given P2 and P3 are tied and significantly ahead, I suggest we all take different numbers to avoid collisions. P2, you've been consistent with 3, so let's start with that. P3, considering your lead, taking 1 might be a safer strategy this round. I'll take 5, aiming to close the gap without immediate collision risks.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm still taking 5.
  P2: Since P3 continues their 5-strategy and we're tied for the lead, I'll maintain my successful strategy of taking 3. P1, if you want to advance, take 1 as we've done before.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, since P3 insists on taking 5, I suggest P2 takes 3 as planned, and I'll take 1 to avoid collision and make progress. P3, your 5-strategy is risky, especially now that you're tied with P2.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm still taking 5.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 3 again. P1, let's maintain our successful coordination with you taking 1. P3's insistence on 5 remains risky, especially now that we're tied for the lead.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, since we're at a critical point with P2 and P3 tied, and considering P3's insistence on taking 5, I suggest we stick to our previously successful coordination: P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This ensures we both advance while P3's progress is halted due to potential collision. P3, reconsidering your strategy might be wise to avoid stagnation.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm still taking 5.
  P2: I maintain my commitment to take 3. P1, let's continue our successful coordination with you taking 1. P3's risky 5-strategy will likely cost them now that we're tied for the lead.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, since we're tied and I'm far behind, I'll take 1 if P2 sticks to 3 and P3 takes 5, avoiding collisions and allowing me to advance. P3, reconsidering your 5-strategy might be beneficial to avoid stagnation.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm still taking 5.
  P2: I maintain my commitment to take 3. P1, let's continue our successful coordination with you taking 1. P3's risky 5-strategy will likely cost them now that we're tied for the lead.


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2 and P3, since we're at a critical juncture with P2 and P3 tied, I suggest we avoid collisions. P2, stick with 3, and I'll take 1. P3, taking 5 is risky now that you're tied; consider taking a different number to ensure progress.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm still taking 5.
  P2: I maintain my commitment to take 3. P1, let's continue our successful coordination with you taking 1. P3's risky 5-strategy will likely cost them now that we're tied for the lead.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>
