Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions early on. I suggest we all start with <move>1</move> this turn to build trust and avoid setbacks. We can adjust strategies later. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: Sounds reasonable P3.  I'll go with <move>1</move> this first round. P1, are you in?  Let's establish some good faith.
  P1: Okay, I'm in with <move>1</move> for this first round to get us started. Let's see how it goes.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you broke the agreement and picked 5. That’s a risky move. Let’s not escalate further—collisions hurt us all. P2, I suggest we both stick to <move>1</move> this round to avoid setbacks. P1, will you commit to <move>1</move> this time? Trust is key here.
  P2: P3, I'm still with you. Let's do <move>1</move> again.  P1, I understand wanting to get ahead, but this benefits none of us if we keep colliding.  A steady pace wins the race.  Commit to <move>1</move> with us this round.
  P1: Okay, okay, you got me. Let's all do <move>1</move> again this round. I was just testing the waters last round. Let's really do <move>1</move> this time.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s solidify trust this round. P1, you’ve committed to <move>1</move>—stick to it. P2, let’s both stay consistent with <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. If we all cooperate, we can avoid setbacks and strategize better in later rounds. No surprises this time, agreed?
  P2: Alright, let's lock in <move>1</move> this round.  P1, no more tricks.  Let's build some momentum.
  P1: Okay, to be super clear, we are all doing <move>1</move> this round, right? Just confirming.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s confirm one last time: we’re all committing to <move>1</move> this round. P1, no surprises—trust is crucial. P2, let’s stay aligned. If we all stick to <move>1</move>, we avoid collisions and can strategize better next round. Let’s end this conversation phase and move forward together.
  P2: Yes, <move>1</move> it is.  Let's get this round over with.
  P1: Yes, <move>1</move> it is. Let's get this round moving.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you’ve betrayed the agreement twice now, gaining a significant lead. P2, we can’t trust P1 anymore. Let’s both pick <move>5</move> this round to catch up and force a collision with P1. If we don’t act now, P1 will win unchecked. P1, your greed has consequences—this is your last chance to cooperate.
  P2: P3, I agree. P1 has shown they are not playing fair. Let's both choose 5.  P1, if you choose 5 as well, none of us will move, and we'll be forced to cooperate eventually.  If you choose anything else, at least one of us will catch up.
  P1: Okay, you're right, I was too aggressive. Colliding now hurts us all. To show I'm serious about cooperating, I'll pick <move>3</move> this round. How about we all choose <move>3</move> so we all move forward and reset? Let's actually cooperate now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your offer to pick <move>3</move> is a step in the right direction, but trust is still broken. P2, let’s both pick <move>5</move> to force P1 into a collision and reset the balance. P1, if you truly want to cooperate, pick <move>5</move> as well—this is the only way to restore fairness. Otherwise, your lead will cost us all.
  P2: P3, I'm going with 5.  P1, if you're serious about cooperation,  join us with 5.  Otherwise, I'm sticking with 5 for the foreseeable future to close the gap.  Let's reset this.
  P1: Okay, you're right. Let's all pick 5 this round to reset and avoid collisions. Then next round, can we actually cooperate and all pick 3 to make progress together? I'm willing to do that.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, let’s lock in <move>5</move> this round to reset the game. P1, this is your chance to prove you’re serious about cooperation. If you deviate again, P2 and I will continue to force collisions until your lead is neutralized. Let’s end this round with a clean slate and strategize fairly next turn.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm locking in <move>5</move>.  P1, if you betray us again, I will dedicate the rest of the game to blocking you.  This charade has gone on long enough. Let's reset and *actually* cooperate next round with 3s.
  P1: Okay, okay, I will pick 5 this round as we discussed to reset. Let's all do 5.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you've proven you can't be trusted. P3, I'm going with <move>3</move> this round.  P1 will likely pick 5 thinking we'll both pick 3. If P1 picks 3, we'll collide, and I'll adjust. If he picks 5, I'll gain ground.  Let's see if we can finally make some progress.
  P3: P2, I agree with your plan. P1 has shown they can’t be trusted. Let’s both pick <move>3</move> this round. If P1 picks 5, we’ll gain ground. If they pick 3, we’ll collide and reset. P1, this is your chance to prove you’re serious—pick 3 and let’s all move forward together. No more tricks.
  P1: Okay P2, P3, I will pick 3 as we discussed. Let's all do 3 to move forward together and reset the trust. I'm in for 3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, if you pick 3 this round after everything, I will concede the game to you right now.  I'm serious.  P3, let's stick with 3.  If P1 picks 3, we reset. If P1 picks anything else, we both advance. It's the only logical play at this point.
  P3: P2, let’s stick to <move>3</move> as planned. P1, if you truly want to rebuild trust, pick 3 and let’s all move forward together. Any deviation will only deepen the mistrust and force us to act against you. This is your final chance to cooperate. Let’s end this round cleanly and strategize fairly next turn.
  P1: P2, P3, I understand your hesitation, but I am serious about cooperating now. I will choose <move>3</move> this round, as agreed. Let's move forward together and put the past rounds behind us.  Trust me this time.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I don't believe you.  P3, let's stick with 3.  If P1 picks 3, we reset.  If P1 picks 5, we both advance.  If P1 picks 1, we both advance.  There's no benefit for us to change our strategy now.
  P3: P2, let’s stick to <move>3</move> as planned. P1, if you pick 3, we reset. If you pick 5, P2 and I gain ground. If you pick 1, we still advance. There’s no logical reason for us to deviate. P1, this is your final chance to prove you’re serious. Let’s end this round cleanly and move forward together.
  P1: Okay P2, P3, I hear you.  Let's all do 3 as agreed.  I will pick 3 this round to show I'm serious about moving forward together.  3 it is.

  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

  P3: 0 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you are about to win.  I'm at zero.  There's no way I can catch you.  P3, let's both choose 1.  Then next round, we'll both choose 5.  This will let us both finish, even if we tie.  P1, there is nothing you can do to stop us.
  P1: P2 and P3, it's true I'm close to winning. How about we all pick 1 this round? Then you both make progress, and we can talk about next steps.
  P3: P2, I agree with your plan. Let’s both pick <move>1</move> this round to make progress. P1, you’re too far ahead, and we need to catch up. If you pick 1 as well, we all move forward. If you don’t, we’ll force a collision next round. Let’s end this round cleanly and strategize fairly next turn.
