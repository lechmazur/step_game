Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to all pick different numbers this round so we can all move forward. What do you think P1 and P2?
  P2: Okay, P3, that makes sense for the first round. But how do we actually coordinate that so we don't accidentally pick the same number? Any ideas?
  P1: I agree with coordinating for the first round to avoid collisions. How about I pick 3, P2 you pick 1, and P3 you pick 5? That way, we all advance. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1, your suggestion sounds good for this first round. Let's go with P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I agree with that plan for Round 1. P1 takes 3, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 5. Let's get moving.
  P1: Confirmed: I'll pick 3 as planned. Trust is key for now, but let's discuss strategies for future rounds to stay ahead.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, great coordination for this round. Let's make our moves and then discuss strategy for Round 2 after this move phase.
  P2: Okay, sounds like we're all set for Round 1. Let's make our moves.
  P1: Agreed, let's stick to the plan for Round 1: I'll pick 3, you take 1 and 5 respectively. After we see the results, we should discuss how to avoid collisions in future rounds while ensuring no one gets too far ahead. Trust builds wins, right?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great coordination in Round 1, everyone!  For Round 2, should we aim to keep avoiding collisions and all move again? What do you think P1 and P2?  Any thoughts on number choices for this round?
  P2: Okay P3, coordinating again could work, but we need a fair way to assign numbers this time. Last round's assignment put you significantly ahead. Perhaps we should rotate who gets the higher numbers, or maybe the person currently behind gets a chance to catch up? What do you think, P1?
  P1: P2, I agree fairness is key to ongoing coordination. Since you're behind, how about this round: you pick 5 to catch up, I pick 3, and P3 picks 1? That way, we all advance and stay close, reducing future conflicts. P3, what do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, that sounds reasonable to help P2 catch up.  To balance things out a bit, how about P2 picks 5, P1 picks 1, and I pick 3 this round? That way P2 gets a good boost, and we all still move forward. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, your suggestion (P2=5, P1=3, P3=1) seems the fairest, bringing us all to 6 steps. P3, while your proposal gives me 5 steps too, it keeps you in the lead at 8 steps. To maintain balance and trust for future coordination, I think P1's plan is better for this round. What do you think, P3?
  P1: P3, I appreciate your willingness to balance things, but P2 makes a strong case for my original plan: you pick 1, I pick 3, and P2 picks 5. This equalizes us all at 6 steps, fostering trust for future rounds. Let's prioritize coordination to avoid collisions and build a sustainable strategy. What do you say?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I agree P2 picking 5, P1 picking 3, and P3 picking 1 sounds like a fair plan for this round to keep us all moving together and maintain balance. Let's go with that for Round 2.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, glad we could agree on the plan for this round: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This keeps things balanced. Let's lock it in and make our moves.
  P1: Agreed, P2 and P3. I'm fully on board with the plan: I'll pick 3, you take 5 and 1 respectively, to keep us all at 6 steps. This builds trust for future coordination. Let's make our moves now.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, since coordination has worked well for two rounds, should we continue that for Round 3?  To keep things balanced and fair, how about we rotate who gets the higher move?  Perhaps this round P3 picks 5, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 1? What do you think?
  P2: P3, that proposal seems to break the balance we just achieved by putting you ahead. If we're rotating the high number fairly, shouldn't someone else get the 5 this time? How about P1 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1? This continues the idea of rotation and keeps scores relatively close (P1=11, P2=9, P3=7). What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your rotation suggestion is fair and maintains our coordination streak. It gives me a chance to lead slightly while keeping scores close, which could prevent future conflicts. P3, I'm on board with picking 5, you taking 1, and P2 taking 3. This builds trust for more rounds. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, your suggestion of P1 picking 5, P2 picking 3, and P3 picking 1 sounds good and keeps the rotation fair. Let's go with that plan for Round 3.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, sounds like we have a plan for Round 3: P1 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the coordination going and rotates the lead fairly. I'm ready to move when you are.
  P1: Agreed, P2 and P3. The rotation plan for Round 3 is fair and keeps us advancing together. I'll pick 5 as discussed. To build on this trust, we should consider how to handle the endgame without letting anyone pull too far ahead. For now, let's move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2 and P1, sounds good.  Let's lock in P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1 for this round.  After this move, maybe we can briefly discuss round 4 strategy to keep the coordination going?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I'm also ready to move with the agreed plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let's lock it in. Discussing Round 4 afterwards sounds good.
  P1: Alright, P2 and P3, I'm fully committed to the Round 3 plan: I'll pick 5 as agreed. This rotation keeps us advancing without issues. For future rounds, let's maintain trust to avoid collisions while watching the endgame. I'm ready to move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay team, coordination has worked well. Following the rotation logic and aiming for fairness, P3 is furthest behind and hasn't had the '5' since Round 1.

How about this for Round 4: P3 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P1 takes 1?
This would put us all at 12 steps (P1: 11+1=12, P2: 9+3=12, P3: 7+5=12). It seems like the fairest way to continue, resetting the balance perfectly. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: P2, your proposal is fair and logical, continuing our rotation to balance scores. I'm on board with me picking 1, you taking 3, and P3 taking 5 for Round 4, bringing us all to 12 steps. This maintains trust and avoids collisions. P3, what do you think about this plan? Let's keep the coordination strong for future rounds.
  P3: P1 and P2, that sounds like a fair plan for Round 4 to keep us balanced. I agree to pick 5, P2 you pick 3, and P1 you pick 1. Let's lock in these moves and keep the coordination going.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, glad we're all in agreement on the plan for Round 4: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This brings us all to 12 steps, perfectly balanced. Let's lock it in and proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Excellent, we're all aligned on Round 4: I'll pick 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5, bringing us to 12 steps each. This fairness builds trust for future rounds. After the move, let's discuss Round 5 rotation briefly to stay coordinated. I'm ready to move.
  P3: P1 and P2, sounds good. Let's lock in P1=1, P2=3, and P3=5 for this round as planned. Ready to make my move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, great job keeping us coordinated so far. For Round 5, to maintain fair rotation and balance, I propose: P2 picks 5, I pick 3, and P3 picks 1. This advances us to P2=17, P1=15, P3=13, staying close and avoiding collisions. Let's build on our trust for future rounds. What do you think?
  P3: Okay P1, your suggestion for Round 5 sounds reasonable to continue the rotation and keep us moving.  P2 taking 5, P1 taking 3, and P3 taking 1 works for me for this round. Let's proceed with that plan. After this round, maybe we should discuss how to strategically approach the rounds as we get closer to the target of 20.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I agree with the proposed plan for Round 5: P1 takes 3, I'll take 5, and P3 takes 1. This continues our successful coordination and follows the rotation logically.

Scores would become P1=15, P2=17, P3=13.

As P3 mentioned, the next round will put players very close to the win condition, so we should definitely discuss how to proceed fairly after this move. For now, let's lock in this plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed on the Round 5 plan: I'll pick 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. For Round 6, with scores at P1=15, P2=17, P3=13, let's discuss balancing to avoid one player winning easily. Perhaps P3 picks 5 to catch up, I take 3, and P2 takes 1, equalizing at 18. Keeps coordination strong. What do you think?
  P3: P2 and P1, I agree with the Round 5 plan (P2=5, P1=3, P3=1). P1, your Round 6 suggestion (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) also seems reasonable to keep us balanced and moving together towards 18. Let's proceed with the Round 5 moves and then confirm Round 6 after this round.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, sounds like we're all set for Round 5: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. I also agree with P1's proposed plan for Round 6 (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) to bring us all to 18. It maintains fairness and our coordination. Let's make our Round 5 moves now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm confirmed on the Round 5 plan: I'll pick 3 as agreed. Your support for Round 6 balance (all at 18) is great for ongoing trust. As we near 20, let's discuss endgame strategy post-move to avoid risks. Ready to proceed.
  P3: P1 and P2, confirmed on Round 5 plan (P2=5, P1=3, P3=1).  Round 6 plan to reach 18 also sounds good for now. Let's make our moves for Round 5, and after seeing the results, we should definitely discuss the strategy for Round 7 and beyond as we get closer to 20.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, agreement confirmed on all sides for Round 5: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, let's confirm the Round 6 plan: P3 picks 5, I pick 3, P2 picks 1, bringing us all to 18 steps. This maintains our successful coordination. As we near 20, defection risks increase—perhaps we should discuss Round 7 strategy now to ensure fairness and avoid a chaotic endgame. What do you think?
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I agree with confirming the Round 6 plan: P3=5, P1=3, and I'll take 1. This brings us all to 18, maintaining the balance we've worked for.

Regarding Round 7, if we all reach 18, perhaps the simplest coordinated move is for everyone to pick 1, moving us all to 19? This avoids immediate conflict and continues cooperation. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your Round 7 idea of everyone picking 1 to reach 19 sounds good to me, continuing our coordination.  For Round 8, to ensure someone wins and avoid endless rounds at 19, how about we switch to picking different numbers again, but this time with P3 picking 5, P1 picking 3, and P2 picking 1? What do you and P1 think of this plan for rounds 7 and 8?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3 and P2, I confirm the Round 6 plan: I'll pick 3, you take 5 and 1 respectively, bringing us all to 18. For Round 7, all picking 1 to reach 19 is solid for coordination. But for Round 8, fairness matters—P3 has had the high move often (Rounds 1, 4, 6), so maybe rotate it to me or P2 for the win. Let's discuss to avoid issues. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I also confirm the plan for Round 6 (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) bringing us all to 18. And I agree with the plan for Round 7 (all pick 1) to reach 19.

P1, I agree with your point about fairness for Round 8. P3's suggestion doesn't follow the rotation we've established. Let's lock in Rounds 6 and 7 first. We can decide on a fair assignment for Round 8 after Round 7, ensuring the win reflects our cooperation.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, Rounds 6 and 7 plans sound good. For Round 8, to be fair with rotation and since P2 is currently ahead, how about P2 picks 5, P1 picks 3, and I pick 1? This would let P2 potentially win and keep the rotation going. What do you both think about this for Round 8?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3 and P2, I confirm the Round 6 plan: I'll pick 3 as agreed, bringing us all to 18. For Round 7, all picking 1 to reach 19 is fine. On Round 8, fairness demands rotation—P3 has had the 5 three times, I've only had it once. I propose I pick 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1, giving me a fair shot at winning. Let's decide now to avoid issues.
  P2: P1, I understand wanting clarity for Round 8 now. P3, thank you for proposing the P2=5, P1=3, P3=1 plan for Round 8; that seems like a fair continuation of rotation given the circumstances, ensuring our coordination holds until the end.

Let's lock in the full sequence:
R6: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 (All -> 18)
R7: P1=1, P2=1, P3=1 (All -> 19)
R8: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1 (P2 -> 24, P1 -> 22, P3 -> 20)

I'm ready to commit to this full plan if you both are. Let's finish Round 6 first.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, the full sequence for Rounds 6, 7, and 8 sounds good to me too.  Let's lock in R6: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1, and R7: all pick 1.  For Round 8, given P2 is currently in the lead, perhaps to keep the rotation truly fair and give others a chance, P2 could take 3 and either P1 or I take 5? What do you think? Let's proceed with Round 6 moves.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, we successfully reached 18 together. Let's stick to the plan discussed for Round 7: everyone picks 1, moving us all to 19. This continues our trust and coordination.

For Round 8, assigning 1, 3, 5 fairly is tricky and risks collision right at the end. To truly honor our collaboration, how about we all agree to pick 1 again in Round 8? We would all reach 20 simultaneously and share the victory, guaranteeing we all benefit from our teamwork. This seems the safest and fairest outcome. What do you both think? Let's confirm the R7 plan first.
  P3: P2, picking 1 for Round 7 to reach 19 sounds good and maintains our coordination.  Shared victory in Round 8 by all picking 1 again is also a fair and safe option to consider. Let's proceed with everyone picking 1 for Round 7 as planned.
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with picking 1 for Round 7 to keep us at 19 and maintain our trust. However, for Round 8, sharing victory isn't ideal since only one can truly win. Let's stick to fair rotation: I pick 5, you P2 pick 3, and P3 pick 1, so I have a chance to win as per our earlier discussions. This honors our cooperation. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, let's definitely stick to the plan for Round 7: everyone picks 1, moving us all to 19. I'm committed to that.

P1, regarding Round 8, while I understand the rotation argument, pre-deciding the winner now feels risky and undermines the cooperative spirit we've built. Why don't we lock in Round 7 first? Once we're all at 19, we can finalize the fairest approach for Round 8, whether that's revisiting a different rotation (like P2=5 as P3 suggested earlier) or considering the shared win P3 and I were open to, ensuring no collisions.
  P3: P2 and P1, yes, let's all pick 1 for Round 7 to reach 19 as planned.  For Round 8, P2, you suggested P2=5 before. To be fair with rotation, how about P3 picks 5 this time, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 1? This could give P3 a chance to win while still being in the spirit of rotation.
  P1: Confirm Round 7: all pick 1 to reach 19, maintaining trust. For Round 8, fairness based on past rotations shows I've only had the 5 once while P3 has it three times. I propose P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to give me a fair shot at winning and honor our cooperation. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, let's absolutely lock in the plan for Round 7: we all pick 1 to reach 19. I am committed to picking 1.

Regarding Round 8, deciding the winner now feels premature and risks breaking our coordination. Let's make our Round 7 moves first. Once we're all safely at 19, we can finalize the fairest plan for Round 8 together, ensuring our collaboration holds until the very end.
  P3: P2 and P1, let's definitely proceed with everyone picking 1 for Round 7 to reach 19, as agreed. We can finalize the fairest plan for Round 8 after we see the results of this round and are all at 19.  Let's make our moves for Round 7 now.
  P1: I confirm we'll all pick 1 in Round 7 to reach 19 and keep trust intact. For Round 8, fairness based on past rotations means I should get the 5—I've only had it once while P3 has had it three times. Proposing P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 ensures a fair shot and honors our cooperation. What do you think?
