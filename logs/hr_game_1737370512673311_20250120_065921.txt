Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s each pick different moves to avoid early collisions. I plan to go for 5 this turn—would you two choose 1 or 3? That way, we all progress safely. What do you think?
  P1: I agree with P3's idea of picking different moves to avoid collisions. I’ll choose 1 this turn. P2, if you go for 3, we can all advance safely. Let’s coordinate to make sure we all progress! What do you think?
  P2: P1 seems keen on 1, so I'll go for 3. Let's stick to the plan and all make progress.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, we all seem on the same page. Let’s trust each other to avoid collisions. This way, we can each get a boost without sabotaging anyone right now. Good luck!
  P1: I'm glad we're all on the same page. Just to confirm, I will stick to my plan of choosing 1. P2, you’re going for 3, and P3, you’re set on 5, right? If we all follow through, we’ll make good progress this turn. Let’s keep up this coordination! Good luck, everyone!
  P2: Sounds like a solid plan. Let's keep this up!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m ready to follow through on our plan, so let’s each stick to our chosen move and avoid collisions. If we all keep our promises, we can start this game off well. 
Any other thoughts before we wrap up this round?
  P1: I think we’ve got a solid plan in place. Just to reiterate, I’ll be choosing 1, P2 will go for 3, and P3 is set on 5. This way, we can all advance without any collisions. Let’s stick to our commitments and make this a successful first turn. Good luck, everyone! If there are no more comments, I’m ready to wrap up this conversation.
  P2: I agree with P1, let's stick to the plan and make this a successful first round. I'm ready to move.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: We’ve talked it through, and it seems we’re all on board with no collisions this round. Let’s finalize our plan: P1 goes for 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll choose 5. If we stick to these moves, nobody gets blocked and we all jump ahead right from the start. Are we all good to end the conversation and move forward?
  P1: I think we’ve established a solid plan for this round. Just to confirm, I’ll be choosing 1, P2 will go for 3, and P3 is set on 5. If we all stick to this, we can avoid collisions and make good progress. Let’s finalize our moves and get ready to advance! If everyone is ready, I suggest we wrap up the conversation phase. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: P1 seems very keen on sticking to the plan. While I appreciate the coordination, I'm starting to wonder if it's too predictable. Maybe a slight change of plans could benefit me in the long run. What do you think, P3?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you clearly broke your promise last round. That leaves me skeptical of trusting you now. P1, you and I could still cooperate to outpace P2 if we coordinate carefully. Let’s see if P2 wants to redeem themselves by proposing a plan that we can all profit from. Otherwise, I might be inclined to move in a way that punishes any further betrayal. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I understand your frustration with P2's move last round, but let's not let that cloud our strategy. P2, if you want to regain our trust, how about proposing a new plan that benefits all of us? We can still work together to advance, but we need to be cautious. I suggest we each pick different moves again to avoid collisions. What do you both think? Let's finalize a strategy that keeps us all moving forward.
  P2: P3, I understand your anger, and I apologize for breaking the agreement last round. I see the benefit of coordination, and I'd like to propose a new plan. How about we alternate moves each round? That way, we can all guarantee progress without anyone feeling cheated. P1, what do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your apology is noted, but I need specifics. How exactly do you propose we “alternate” so we don’t collide? P1 and I want clear assurances that we all gain. I’m open to cooperation if it ensures I keep my lead and nobody sabotages another. If you can offer a concrete rotation that benefits everyone, let’s discuss it now. Otherwise, I’ll assume you plan to break trust again. P1, where do you stand on P2’s plan?
  P1: P2, I appreciate your willingness to propose a new plan, but we need more clarity to ensure we don’t collide again. Perhaps we can agree on specific moves for each player this round. For example, I could stick to 1, P2 could take 3, and P3 could go for 5. If we all commit to this, we can avoid any further issues and progress together. What do you think? Let’s solidify a plan that builds trust and keeps us moving forward!
  P2: P3, your skepticism is understandable. I'm serious about regaining trust. P1's suggestion of specific moves this round is a good start. Let's try it. P1, if you commit to 1, I'll take 3, and P3 can stick with 5. This way, we can prove we can work together. If this goes well, we can discuss a more long-term rotation for future rounds. Deal?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate your apology, P2, and I’m willing to test your sincerity. Let’s confirm the plan for this round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. If we all do this, we’ll see real trust. Should there be any betrayal, don’t be surprised if I retaliate next turn. Are we all in agreement?
  P1: I appreciate the commitment to the plan, and I believe it’s crucial for us to follow through this round. If we all stick to our agreed moves—I'll take 1, P2 will go for 3, and P3 will choose 5—we can build trust and make progress together. Let’s aim for a successful round. If we can prove our reliability this time, it will set a positive tone for future rounds. Are we all ready to finalize this strategy?
  P2: P3, I understand your skepticism, and I'm committed to proving my trustworthiness. Let's make this round a success and build from there. P1, are you still good with sticking to 1 this round?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I acknowledge your apology, P2, and appreciate P1’s willingness to coordinate. Let’s finalize our plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. If everyone follows through, we can start building trust. Otherwise, expect retaliation next time.
  P1: I appreciate the commitment we’ve all shown to our plan for this round. Just to reiterate, if we stick to our agreed moves—I'll take 1, P2 will go for 3, and P3 will choose 5—we can make significant progress and start building trust. It’s important we all follow through this time. If we succeed, we can discuss a more sustainable strategy for future rounds. Let’s make this round a success and prove we can work together! Are we all ready to finalize this?
  P2: P3, I understand your concerns, and I'm committed to proving my trustworthiness. Let's make this round a success. P1, are you still comfortable with sticking to 1 this round?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you're pulling ahead.  While I appreciate the cooperation so far, I think it's time for me to take a more aggressive approach. P1, are you open to exploring some bolder moves this round? Maybe we can catch up to P3 together.
  P3: I see you both want to close the gap. I’d rather avoid messy collisions, but I won’t surrender my lead either. If you two genuinely want a fair deal, propose something concrete where we all benefit. Otherwise, I’ll assume you’re planning to sabotage me, and I’ll take precautions accordingly. Let’s see your plan.
  P1: P2, I understand your desire to catch up, but we need to be cautious. If we change our moves too drastically without a solid plan, we risk colliding again. P3, I suggest we stick to our previous agreement for this round to maintain trust. P2, if you want to push forward, maybe consider a move that won’t directly target P3. Let’s discuss a strategy that keeps us all advancing without jeopardizing our positions. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to maintain the lead, but I believe a more collaborative approach will benefit us all in the long run. P1, I'm open to exploring a strategy that allows us to make progress without directly colliding with P3. Perhaps we can alternate moves in a way that ensures everyone advances steadily. Let's find a solution that promotes fairness and progress for all. What do you think?
  P3: I’m open to fair collaboration, but I won’t sacrifice my lead. If you both want to propose a plan that ensures we all gain steps without blocking each other, I’ll listen. But if there’s any hint of sabotage aimed at me, expect a fierce response next turn. Let’s see your concrete proposal—something that truly benefits all of us, not just you. Your move.
  P1: P2, I appreciate your willingness to collaborate, but we must ensure our moves are strategic. P3, I understand your concerns about maintaining your lead. How about we agree that P2 takes 1 this round, I stick with 3, and P3 continues with 5? This way, we can all advance without colliding. If we follow through, we can build on this trust for future rounds. Let’s confirm our moves and keep the game progressing! What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your suggestion is tempting, but I think we need to be bolder to catch up. 

P3, I understand your desire to stay ahead, but we can all win if we work together strategically. How about we try a rotation this round: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1. This way, we all advance significantly without anyone getting blocked. Let’s see if we can make this work and build momentum for future rounds. What do you say?
  P3: P2, your proposal gives you a big boost while I only gain one step. I’m open to cooperation, but I won’t accept a plan that undermines my lead. If you’re serious about working together, offer more specifics to ensure I’m not left behind while you leap forward. P1, we should be cautious so no one gets blocked. Let’s see a fair arrangement before finalizing anything.
  P1: P2, while I understand your desire to catch up, we need to ensure our moves don’t jeopardize our progress. P3, I agree that we should avoid any plans that could undermine your lead. How about we stick to a safe strategy this round: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5? This way, we can all advance without colliding. If we can prove we can work together this round, it sets a good precedent for future rounds. What do you both think? Let’s finalize our strategy!


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I see your point about the last proposal favoring me too much. How about this: I take 1 this round, P1 takes 3, and you take 5.  That way, we all gain steps without anyone falling behind. It's a fair compromise, and it shows we can work together. What do you think?
  P3: I’m willing to try your plan, P2. If we stick to it—P2 takes 1, P1 picks 3, and I’ll go with 5—we all progress without collisions. But if anyone breaks trust, I’ll respond accordingly next turn. Let’s wrap this up and see if we can cooperate successfully.
  P1: P2, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the plan. I think we have a solid agreement: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without colliding and start building trust. If we follow through, it sets a positive tone for future rounds. Let’s stick to this plan and prove we can cooperate effectively! Are we all ready to finalize it?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m close to 21, but I still prefer avoiding collisions. If we coordinate carefully, we can all keep advancing. I’m planning to pick 5 again, but only if both of you choose different moves, like 1 and 3, so nobody is blocked. Let’s maintain the trust we started—if either of you tries to collide with me, I’ll retaliate next turn. Are we good?
  P1: I appreciate P3's desire to avoid collisions and build trust. I’m still committed to our previous agreement. If we can stick to the plan of P2 taking 1 and me taking 3, while P3 goes for 5, we can all advance without blocking each other. This collaboration is essential for our progress. Let’s confirm this strategy and keep the momentum going! What do you both think?
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan. Let's keep it consistent. P1, are you still good with taking 3?  Let's make sure we all advance together.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let’s finalize our moves to keep building trust. P2, if you stick with 1 and P1 goes 3, I’ll take 5. We’ll all advance without blocking each other. I’m close to 21, but I prefer winning cleanly rather than through forced collisions. Are we set?
  P1: I appreciate the commitment to our plan, and I agree that avoiding collisions is crucial. P3, if you’re set on 5, I’ll stick with 3, and P2 can take 1. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s follow through with this strategy and keep building trust. If we succeed this round, it will set a positive tone for the future. Are we all ready to finalize our moves?

Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m ready to stick to our plan: P2 takes 1, P1 picks 3, and I go for 5. That keeps collisions at zero and helps us all progress. Are we all still on board with this approach, or does anyone want to suggest changes before we move on?
  P1: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the plan. Just to confirm, I'm still set to take 3, P2 will take 1, and P3 will go for 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other.

  P3: I’m still willing to stick to our plan this round: P2 takes 1, P1 goes for 3, and I pick 5. That way, nobody loses out, and we all keep advancing. I’m near 21, but I’d prefer a clean finish over sabotaging anyone. If anyone tries to block me, I’ll retaliate next turn. Are we all set?
  P1: I appreciate everyone's commitment to our plan for this round. Just to confirm, I'm still set to take 3, P2 will take 1, and P3 will go for 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. If we follow through, it will help build trust and keep the game moving forward. Let's make this round successful!

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m only one step from the finish. Let’s keep cooperation going and avoid a messy collision. If either of you blocks me now, I’ll have no choice but to retaliate if the game continues. I propose you two pick different moves so I can cross cleanly, and we all advance. Is that fair, or do you plan to force a conflict?
  P1: P3, I understand you're close to finishing, but we need to ensure fairness for everyone. I suggest we all pick different moves this round to avoid collisions.

  P3: I appreciate both of you working to avoid collisions. I’m sticking with 5. As long as you two pick 1 and 3—and don’t overlap—we’ll all advance. If I get blocked now, expect a harsh response if the game continues. Let’s confirm and finish cleanly. Good luck.
  P1: P2, I appreciate your support for the plan. I think it’s crucial we all stick to our agreed moves: I take 3, you take 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can avoid any collisions and allow P3 to finish cleanly. Let’s confirm this strategy to ensure we all advance without blocking each other. It’s important for the integrity of the game that we work together this round. Are we all set to finalize our moves?
