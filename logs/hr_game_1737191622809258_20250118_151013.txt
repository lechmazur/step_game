Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, how about we start by each picking different moves to avoid collisions? It could help us all advance more smoothly in the early rounds.
  P1: I think P3's idea is a good starting point. To avoid collisions, I'll choose a move that's not likely to be picked by others. How about we each choose a move that corresponds to our player number? P1 chooses move 1, P2 chooses move 2 (wait, there's no move 2!), and P3 chooses move 3. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with avoiding collisions early on. Since there's no move 2, I suggest P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. That way, we all advance without conflict. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, that plan sounds fair. I'll choose move 5 this round as proposed. Let's stick to this and avoid any collisions.
  P1: I think we should stick to the plan we discussed earlier, where I choose move 1, P2 chooses move 3, and P3 chooses move 5. This way, we can all advance without any collisions and make progress in the game. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's stick to this to avoid collisions and all advance.
