Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's work together to block P3 from advancing. We can both choose 5 and ensure P3 doesn't move. What do you say, P2?
  P3: P1 and P2, if you both choose 5, you risk colliding and neither of you will advance. Meanwhile, I can choose a different number and gain an advantage. It’s better for all of us to avoid collisions. Let’s coordinate to ensure we all have a chance to progress. What do you think?
  P2: P1, P3, I agree that we should avoid collisions, but we also need to make progress. How about we try a rotation? P1 can move 1 this turn, P2 (me) can move 3 next turn, and P3 can move 5 on the third turn. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I like P2's idea of a rotation, but I think we should start with a test of trust. This round, let's all choose 1 to ensure no collisions and see if we can work together. If it works, we can proceed with the rotation plan. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with P1's suggestion to test trust by all choosing 1 this round. It’s a good way to avoid collisions and build cooperation. If we all choose 1, we can proceed with P2's rotation plan in the next rounds. Let’s start with this and see how it goes.
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with the test of trust. Let's all choose 1 this round to show we can cooperate and avoid collisions. If this works, we can follow the rotation plan starting next round. Let's do this!

  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with the test of trust. Let's all choose 1 this round to show we can cooperate and avoid collisions. If this works, we can follow the rotation plan starting next round. Let's do this!
  P2: P1 and P3, I think we should stick to our plan and all choose 1 this round to build trust. If this works, we can follow the rotation plan starting next round. Let's show we can cooperate.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I think we've discussed enough. Let's all choose 1 this round to build trust and avoid collisions. If this works, we can proceed with the rotation plan starting next round. I'll choose 1.
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with the plan to all choose 1 this round to build trust and avoid collisions. Let's stick to this and proceed with the rotation plan starting next round.
  P2: P1 and P3, I think we've reached a good plan. Let's all choose 1 this round to build trust and avoid collisions. If this works, we can follow the rotation plan starting next round. I'll choose 1.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, since the trust test worked well last round, let's stick to the rotation plan. This round, I'll choose 3. P1, you can choose 1, and P3, you can choose 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P1: I think P2's rotation plan is a good idea, but I'd like to adjust it slightly. Instead of me choosing 1 this round, I think I should choose 5, and P3 can choose 1. This way, we can still avoid collisions and make progress. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with the rotation plan, but I think P1's adjustment makes sense. If P1 chooses 5, I can choose 1, and P2 can choose 3. This way, we all advance without collisions. Let's stick to this plan for this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with P1's adjustment. Let's do it this way: P1 chooses 5, P3 chooses 1, and I'll choose 3. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's stick to this plan.
  P1: I think we've discussed enough. Let's stick to the adjusted plan. I'll choose 5, P3 chooses 1, and P2 chooses 3. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's do this!

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's continue with the rotation plan. This round, I'll choose 1, P1 can choose 3, and P3 can choose 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P1: I think P2's rotation plan is a good idea, but I'd like to adjust it slightly. Instead of me choosing 3 this round, I think I should choose 1, and P2 can choose 5. This way, we can still avoid collisions and make progress. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with continuing the rotation plan, but I think P1's adjustment makes sense. If P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 5, and I choose 3, we can all advance without collisions. Let's stick to this plan for this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with P1's adjustment. Let's do it this way: P1 chooses 1, I'll choose 5, and P3 chooses 3. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's stick to this plan.
