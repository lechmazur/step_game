Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's start by avoiding collisions. I suggest P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we all move forward without any issues. Agree?
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I like your suggestion. P1, are you okay with going with 1 this round?


Round 1, Move phase:

Positions now:

  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, let's try to coordinate better this time. How about P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 3? This way, we can all move forward. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I'm open to coordinating, but your suggestion puts us at risk of colliding again.  Maybe we should try a different pattern this time? What if P1 goes for 5, I go for 1, and you go for 3?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I appreciate your input. How about a compromise? P1 picks 1, you pick 5, and I'll stick with 3. This way, we all choose different numbers and avoid collisions. Let's confirm and move on. P1, your thoughts?
  P2: P3, I like the compromise. P1, are you okay with picking 1 this round?  Let's try to stick to this plan and see how it goes.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems we're having trouble coordinating. To simplify, let's try a rotating pattern starting this round. P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. Next round, we'll rotate: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 1, and so on. This way, we have a clear pattern to follow. Does that work for both of you? Let's confirm and move on.
  P2: P3, I appreciate the effort to establish a pattern, but I'm not comfortable with a fixed rotation. It makes us predictable.  P1, are you open to trying something more spontaneous this round? Maybe we can each choose a number at random?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 =>

  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your rotating pattern idea is interesting, but I think it's too predictable. P1, how about we try a different approach this time? Let's each pick a number randomly. That way, we can avoid collisions and keep things interesting. What do you think?
  P3: P3: Given the past collisions, let's simplify. P1, you pick 1. P2, you pick 3. I'll pick 5. This avoids past issues. If we stick to this for a few rounds, we can all make progress. Thoughts?
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm not convinced sticking to a rigid pattern is the best strategy long-term. It might be predictable for opponents. P1, what are your thoughts on trying something more flexible this round? Maybe we can each choose a number based on the current positions?
  P3: Alright, let's address the concerns. P2, you're right about predictability. How about this: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 1. This way, we're not following a rigid pattern but still avoiding past choices. Let's confirm and move on. P1, P2, thoughts?
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I see your point about predictability. However, I think we need to be more adaptable. P1, what if we each choose a number based on the current positions?  We could factor in how far behind we are and try to make up ground strategically.  Thoughts?
  P3: P3: Alright, let's simplify further. P1 and P2, you both have 0 steps. To avoid collisions and ensure progress, let's try this: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 3. This way, we all choose different numbers and move forward. If this works, we can adjust next round. Agree?
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:

  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your suggestion of a rotating pattern is intriguing, but I'm hesitant to commit to something so rigid. P1, what are your thoughts on trying something more spontaneous this round? Perhaps we can each pick a number based on the current positions and try to strategize our moves?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that our previous attempts at coordination haven't worked out. Given that I'm ahead, how about you both pick 3 this round to catch up? I'll pick 1 to minimize my advance. This way, you both make progress, and we avoid a three-way collision. Let's confirm and move on. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I appreciate the offer, but I think we need to be more strategic. Picking 3 might put us at risk of colliding again. P1, are you open to trying a different approach this round? Maybe we can each choose a number based on the current positions and try to make a calculated move?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Alright, let's try a different approach to avoid further collisions. P1, you pick 1. P2, you pick 5. I'll pick 3. This way, we all choose different numbers and can make progress. If this works, we can adjust next round. Agree?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to avoid collisions, but I think we need to be more strategic than just assigning numbers. P1, how about we try to anticipate each other's moves and choose numbers that will help us gain ground while minimizing the risk of a collision?  Let's work together to outsmart P3.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems we're at an impasse with coordination. Since I'm ahead, I'll take a risk to break the stalemate. I'll pick 1 this round to give you both a chance to catch up. You two should pick 3 and 5. If we collide, we collide, but at least we're trying something new. Thoughts?


Round 4, Move phase:

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, your strategy of picking 1 is interesting, but I think we can do better. P1, let's try to coordinate this round and see if we can catch up to P3. How about we both pick 5? That way, we have a chance to make a significant jump. What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that our previous attempts at coordination haven't been successful. Given the current positions, let's try a new strategy. P1, you pick 5 to catch up. P2, you pick 3 to make some progress. I'll pick 1 to minimize my lead and reduce the risk of collisions. This way, we all choose different numbers and can make progress. Let's confirm and move on. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I appreciate your attempt at strategy, but I think we need to be more aggressive to catch up. P1, I propose we both pick 5 this round. It's a risk, but it could give us a big boost. What do you say?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see that coordination is still challenging. Given my lead, I'll take a step back to help you both catch up. I'll pick 1 this round. P1, you pick 3 to make steady progress. P2, you pick 5 to gain significant ground. This way, we avoid collisions and you both have a chance to advance. Let's confirm and move on. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, while I appreciate your offer to help us catch up, I think we need to be more assertive. P1, I propose we both pick 5. It's a risky move, but it could give us the boost we need to overtake P3. What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that coordination has been difficult, and my lead is significant. To keep the game interesting, I propose a new strategy. Let's all pick 1 this round. This ensures no collisions and gives you both a chance to start making progress. It's a small step, but it's a step forward for everyone. Thoughts?

  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that our previous strategies haven't been effective. Given my significant lead, I'll take a risk to keep the game dynamic. I propose we all pick 3 this round. It's a balanced move that could either help you catch up or maintain the status quo. If we collide, we collide, but it's a risk worth taking to break the current stalemate. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, your suggestion is tempting, but I think we can be more strategic. P1, let's try to close the gap with P3. How about we both pick 5 this round? It's a risk, but it could pay off big.
  P1: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, given that I'm still in the lead, I'll take a step back to help you both catch up. I'll pick 1 this round. P1, you pick 5 to make a significant jump. P2, you pick 3 to make steady progress. This way, we avoid collisions and you both have a chance to advance. Let's confirm and move on. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, your offer is generous, but I'm not convinced it's the best move. P1, I think we should aim for 5 again. We need to make a bold move to catch up. What do you say?
  P1: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your desire to catch up, but picking the same number won't help. Let's try something different. P1, you pick 1. P2, you pick 3. I'll pick 5. This way, we all choose different numbers and make progress. If you both want to catch up, avoiding collisions is crucial. Let's confirm and move on. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, while your suggestion seems reasonable, I think we need to be more aggressive. P1, are you willing to try picking 5 again? It's a risk, but it could be our best chance to close the gap with P3.
  P1: <stop>

  P1: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, since we're struggling with coordination, let's simplify. I'll pick 1 to minimize my lead. P1, you pick 3 to make steady progress. P2, you pick 5 to gain significant ground. This way, we avoid collisions and you both have a chance to advance. Let's confirm and move on. Thoughts?

  P1: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems we're at a stalemate with our strategies. To shake things up, how about we all pick 1 this round? It's a small step, but it ensures no collisions and keeps the game moving. If we all agree, it could be a fresh start for better coordination in future rounds. Thoughts?
