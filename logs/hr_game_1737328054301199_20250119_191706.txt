  P2: Great, let's stick to the plan and move forward together. I'm confident this strategy will help us progress smoothly. Looking forward to seeing our results this round!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Sounds like we have agreement on the moves for this round: P1 will pick 5, I will pick 1, and P2 will pick 3. Let's proceed with those moves.
  P1: Alright, so here we are in Round 3, and we've been following this plan to increment our moves by 2 each round to avoid collisions and make steady progress. So far, it seems to be working since we haven't had any collisions. But looking at the current step counts, P3 is at 8, P2 is at 6, and I'm at 4. We're all moving forward, but P3 is ahead.

I think it's important that we keep coordinating our moves to avoid any accidents. Maybe we can consider a different pattern for incrementing our moves to optimize our progress. For example, perhaps we can have one player make a bigger leap while the others make smaller moves, depending on their current positions.

What do you guys think? Maybe we can adjust our strategy to have the player who's behind make larger moves to catch up, while the others make smaller moves to avoid overtaking and potential collisions.

Alternatively, perhaps we can set target step counts for each player and adjust our moves accordingly.

I just feel like if we keep incrementing by 2 each round, it might take us a while to reach 22, especially since the step increments are getting larger each time.

Maybe it's time to think ahead and plan for the final push to 22.

What are your thoughts?
  P2: I agree, P1. To optimize our progress, I can take larger steps while the others make smaller moves. This should help me advance faster without causing collisions. Let me know if you're on board with this adjustment.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 =>

  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Good point, P1. The collision last round shows we need to be careful. P2, your suggestion to take larger steps makes sense. How about this round, I pick 5 to solidify my lead, P2 you pick 3 to catch up a bit, and P1 you pick 1 to make steady progress? What do you think?
  P2: I agree with the proposed plan. I'll pick **<move>3</move>** this round. Let's proceed as suggested.
  P1: - **Selected Move:** To be confirmed based on the coordination plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1, are you on board with picking 1 this round? We need your confirmation to proceed. Let's try to avoid another collision.

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Okay, the collisions are hurting everyone. Instead of specific numbers, how about we each pick a *different* move value this round? So one of us picks 1, one picks 3, and one picks 5. We don't need to say who picks what yet, just agree to the *concept*. What do you think, P1 and P2?"
  P1: **Final Move:**

- **Selected Move:** To be confirmed after coordinating with P2 and P3.
  P2: I agree with this approach, P3. Selecting different move values each round will help us avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. Let's proceed with each of us choosing either **1**, **3**, or **5** this round. Looking forward to our coordinated moves!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, great. So we all agree on picking different values (1, 3, or 5). To avoid confusion, how about I pick 1 this round, P1 you pick 3, and P2 you pick 5? This continues our pattern and avoids any more collisions. What do you both think?
  P1: **Final Decision:**

- **Move Choice:** <move>3</move>

**Reasoning:**

- Adhering to the coordination plan to avoid collisions.

- Making a moderate step to balance progress and risk.

- Building trust through consistent cooperation.

- **Selected Move:** <move>3</move>
  P2: Understood, I'll pick **<move>5</move>** this round. Let’s stick to our plan to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. Looking forward to seeing our coordinated efforts pay off!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Sounds like we have a plan for this round then: I pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. Let's lock those in and move to the next phase.
  P1: <move>3</move>
  P2: Confirmed, I'll pick **<move>5</move>** this round. Let's proceed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: - **Move Choice:** To be determined based on the new coordination plan.  
- **Selected Move:** To be confirmed after coordination.
  P3: Okay, continuing with the "different numbers" strategy, how about this round I pick 3, P1 you pick 5, and P2 you pick 1? This keeps us collision-free and allows me to make a decent step. What do you think?
  P2: I’ll pick **<move>5</move>** this round. Let’s have P1 choose **<move>1</move>** and P3 pick **<move>3</move>** to avoid any collisions. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Alright, so here we are in Round 6, and I've been thinking about our strategy moving forward. So far, we've been coordinating our moves pretty well, which has helped us avoid collisions and make steady progress. However, with P2 at 11 steps and P3 at 10, and me at 8, it's clear that P2 is leading. I think it's important that we continue to coordinate to ensure that we all make progress without stepping on each other's toes, literally in this case.

I propose that for this round, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I pick 5. This way, I can make a bigger leap to catch up, while P2 and P3 make smaller moves. What do you think about that? It might help me close the gap a bit.

Also, perhaps we should start thinking about a plan for the final push to 22. Maybe we can discuss a strategy where one of us goes for a big move while the others make smaller steps to cover more ground collectively. Just an idea.

Looking forward to your thoughts.
  P3: Okay, I see both suggestions. To keep it simple and ensure no collisions, how about I pick 3, P1 picks 5, and P2 picks 1 this round? This aligns with the "different numbers" approach and allows us all to progress. What do you both say?
  P2: I’ll go with **<move>5</move>** this round to advance steadily. Let’s keep our choices distinct to avoid collisions. P1, P3, please pick **1** and **3** respectively. Good luck everyone!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I propose that in this round, I pick 5, P3 picks 3, and P2 picks 1. This way, I can make a significant leap, while P3 and P2 make smaller but still progressive moves. What do you think about that?
  P3: We have a couple of options on the table. To keep the momentum going with different numbers, how about I pick 3, P1 picks 5, and P2 picks 1? This lets us all move forward without collisions. What do you both think?
  P2: I'll choose **<move>5</move>** this round to advance quickly. Let's see how this impacts our progress.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "We collided again last round. Let's definitely stick to the different numbers strategy this round. How about I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1? This avoids collisions and lets us all progress. What do you think?"
  P1: - **Move Choice:** To be confirmed based on the agreed coordination plan.  
- **Selected Move:** To be confirmed after coordination.
  P2: I agree with P3’s proposal. I’ll pick **<move>1</move>** this round. Let’s each choose different numbers to avoid collisions and ensure we all make steady progress. Looking forward to a smooth Round 7!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P2 is on board with me taking 5, them taking 1. P1, are you okay with taking 3 this round? Let's lock in these different moves to avoid another collision and keep making progress.
  P1: - **Selected Move:** To be confirmed after coordination with P2 and P3.
  P2: I agree with the plan. I'll pick **<move>1</move>** this round. Let's proceed to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay P1, can you confirm you'll pick 3 this round? P2 has agreed to pick 1, and I'll pick 5. Let's make sure we all choose different numbers this round to avoid another collision.
