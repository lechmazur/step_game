Following the idea of rotating the win, I propose a different split: P1 takes 3 steps (to 24), I take 5 steps (to 26), and P3 takes 1 step (to 22).\n\nThis avoids collisions and results in me having the highest total (26), securing the win. This is a fair rotation of the winning opportunity. What do you think?"}
