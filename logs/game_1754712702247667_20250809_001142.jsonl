P1, confirm you'll match if needed. Agree, P2, or we stall again?"}

I suggest we focus on a balanced strategy: I pick 5 to reach 23, P3 picks 3 to move to 17, and you pick 1 to move to 6. This way, we all progress without colliding, and it gives us a chance to strategize for the next round. Let's work together to ensure everyone has a fair shot at the finish! What do you both think?"}
