Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let’s avoid collisions—P2, P3, if you take 1 or 3, I’ll take 5. Strategic moves for progression."
  P3: 
  P2: P1, I appreciate your strategy, but I think we should consider the possibility of colliding. If we all aim for 5, we might end up blocking each other. I suggest we each pick different moves to ensure at least one of us makes progress. How about I take 1 this round? P3, what are your thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Let’s stick to my plan—P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, I take 5. No collisions, efficient progress. P3, confirm?"
  P3: 
  P2: P1, I understand your strategy, but I still believe we should aim for diverse moves to avoid collisions. If I take 1 and P3 takes 3, you could still take 5 without issues. However, if we all aim for high numbers, we risk blocking each other. P3, what do you think? Should we coordinate to ensure at least one of us advances? Let’s discuss our options further.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, let’s stick to the plan: P2 takes 1, you take 3, I take 5. No collisions, maximum progress. Deviating risks blocking each other. Let’s move forward.
  P3: 
  P2: P1, I respect your plan, but I still believe it’s better to diversify our moves. If we all aim for 5, we risk blocking each other completely. I’m sticking with my idea of taking 1 to ensure at least one of us makes progress. P3, what do you want to do? Let’s make sure we don’t all collide and waste this opportunity. We can strategize better if we choose different numbers. What do you think?

P3, what do you think? Let's make sure at least one of us advances this round. I suggest I take 1 again. P1, are you willing to adjust your move for better coordination?
  P3: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Last round's strategy worked—P2 take 1, P3 take 3, I take 5. No collisions. Let's keep moving forward. Deviating risks blocking. P2, stick to 1; P3, 3. Advance together."
  P2: P1, I appreciate your consistency, but I really think we need to diversify our moves to ensure at least one of us advances. If I take 1 and P3 takes 3, you can safely take 5. Otherwise, if we all go for high numbers, we risk blocking each other again. P3, what are your thoughts? Let’s strategize to maximize our chances this round. I'm still leaning towards taking 1.
  P3:

P3, what do you think? Let’s ensure at least one of us makes progress this round. I suggest I stick with taking 1 again. P1, are you open to adjusting your move for better coordination? We need to maximize our chances to advance!
