Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all pick different numbers this first round to avoid a collision. I'm open to coordinating for future rounds, but let's get some initial movement on the board.  I suggest P1 choose 1, P3 choose 3, and I'll take 5.  What do you think?
  P3: I'm willing to coordinate. However, I don't see why I should take 3 and P1 gets to take the smallest step of 1. How about P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1? This way, we still avoid collision but distribute the steps more fairly.
  P1: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, how about this: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 3.  This lets us all move forward initially and sets us up for future coordination.  We can discuss strategy for the next round after this one.
  P3: I think P2's last suggestion is reasonable. P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P2 takes 3. This way, we all move forward and can reassess for the next round. Let's agree on this to avoid collision and make some progress. What's P1's thoughts on this proposal?
  P1: <stop>


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given P1 and I didn't move last round due to collision, let's try again. P1, since you picked 5 last round, how about you choose 1 this time? P2, you could pick 3 again. I'll choose 5 to avoid another collision and make progress. What are your thoughts on this new distribution for Round 2?
  P2: Sounds good to me. P1 goes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5.  Let's stick to this for a few rounds to build up some distance, then we can re-evaluate our strategy.
  P1: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's confirm our agreement from the previous sub-round. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures we all move forward without collision. Shall we proceed with this plan for Round 2?
  P2: Yes, let's confirm. P1 - 1, me - 3, P3 - 5.  We can continue this pattern for the next round or two as well to ensure steady progress.
  P1: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's finalize our plan for Round 2. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures progress without collision. If we stick to this, we can reassess our strategy in the next round. Shall we proceed with this agreement?
  P2: Agreed.  P1 - 1, P2 - 3, P3 - 5. Let's stick with this for round 2.
  P1: <stop>


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given P1 and I are at 0 steps, and P2 is at 6, let's reconsider our strategy. I propose P1 and I choose different numbers to catch up, while P2 chooses a number that avoids collision with us. Perhaps P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P2 takes 3, ensuring progress for all without immediate collision. What are your thoughts on adjusting our approach to the game's current state?
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the desire to catch up, but constantly switching creates more opportunities for collisions. I'm sticking with 3.  One of you take 1, the other take 5.  If you both refuse to coordinate, I'll be happy to keep advancing and win by default.  Let's make some progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, since P1 hasn't responded, I'll suggest a direct approach: I'll take 5. P1, you can take 1 to start moving. P2, you've said you'll take 3. This way, we all move forward without collision. Let's proceed with this plan for Round 3.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, I understand you're being quiet, but this hurts you most.  I'll stick with 3. Choose 1. P3, if P1 chooses 1, you choose 5. If P1 chooses 5, you choose 1.  This is the simplest way for us all to make progress. Let's stop wasting time and actually play.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm at 9, you're both at 0.  Continuing to fight each other only benefits me.  I'm taking 3 again this round.  One of you choose 1, the other choose 5.  If you collide again, I'll be halfway to winning while you're still stuck at zero.  Let's be smart about this.
  P3: P1, it's clear we need to stop colliding. I'll choose 1 this round if you choose 5. P2 is pulling ahead, and we must act to catch up. Let's finally make some progress without collision. P2, your strategy is working because we're not coordinating. Let's change that this round.
  P1: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I appreciate you finally acknowledging the obvious. P1, if you choose 5 this round, I'll choose 1 next round and guarantee you a clean 5 after that. If you take 1 this round, all bets are off and I'll prioritize my own victory.  Let's get you on the board.  P3, I'll take 3 this round as planned.
  P3: P1, let's end this stalemate. I'll take 1 if you take 5. P2 is getting too far ahead. If we don't coordinate now, we'll never catch up. Let's make a move and start progressing. P2, your offer to P1 is empty since you'll prioritize your victory regardless. Let's focus on making progress this round.
  P1: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, take 5.  I'll take 3. P3, take 1.  I'm offering you a guaranteed 5 next round if we do this.  If P1 takes 1, I'm taking 5 next round and leaving you both at zero while I approach victory. This is your best chance to get ahead. Let's make it happen.
  P3: P1, let's break the cycle. I'll take 1, you take 5. P2 is too far ahead, and we must act. If we collide again, P2 wins by default. Let's finally move forward without collision and give ourselves a chance to catch up. P2's offers are empty; our only hope is coordinating with each other. Let's make a change this round.
  P1: <stop>


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's reassess. P2 is pulling ahead, and P1 finally moved. I'll take 5 if P1 takes 1, ensuring we both progress without collision. P2, consider taking 3 to maintain your lead without blocking us. Let's aim for a collision-free round to make the game more competitive.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, stick with 5 this round.  I'll take 3. P3, take 1. Next round, P1 can take 1, I'll take 3, and you take 5.  This guarantees steady progress for all of us and avoids further collisions. Let's agree on this two-round plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, since P1 has moved, let's ensure P3 catches up. I suggest P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P2 takes 3, maintaining progress without collision. This allows P3 to close the gap while P1 and P2 continue advancing. Let's focus on a collision-free round to keep the game competitive.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, let's lock in our progress: you take 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5 this round.  Next round, we reverse it: you take 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This guarantees us both consistent advancement. P3, this is your chance to catch up â€“ agree to this plan and we all benefit. Let me know if you're in.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's simplify: I'll take 5 if P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This round, we can all progress without collision. P2's two-round plan is unreliable; let's focus on this round's progress. P1, taking 1 allows you to move again next round, and I catch up. P2, taking 3 maintains your lead without blocking us. Let's agree on a straightforward, collision-free round.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1 take 1, I'll take 3, P3 take 5.  This is the best option for all of us to make progress.  Let's stop overthinking this and just move.  If you two collide again, I win.  If we follow this, we all advance.  Simple.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, take 1. P3, take 5. I'll take 3.  This puts me at 18. Next round, I take 3 and win.  Let's just wrap this up cleanly.  If you collide, I *still* win.  This is the most logical path to a swift conclusion.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's not follow P2's suggestion blindly. Since P2 is close to winning, we should try to block their next move. P1, consider taking 3 this round, and I'll take 1. This way, P2 can't advance, giving us a chance to catch up in the next rounds. Let's think strategically about our next steps.
  P1: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you're right, I'm close.  But blocking me just delays the inevitable.  P1, if you take 1 and P3 takes 5 this round, I'll take 5 next round and still win. If you both try to block me with 3, *neither* of you move, and I *still* win the round after.  Take 1, let's end this.
  P3: P1 and P2, since P2 is close to winning, let's block their next move. P1, take 3 this round, and I'll take 1. This prevents P2 from advancing to 18 and gives us a chance to catch up. It's our last opportunity to turn the game around. Let's make a strategic move to prolong the game and potentially change the outcome.
  P1: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, seriously, just take 1.  P3, take 5.  Let's end this.  If you block me, I'll just win the next round.  If you collide *again*, I win even sooner.  Stop wasting time.
  P3: P1, take 3 to block P2's advance. I'll take 1. This is our last chance to change the game's course. If we collide or follow P2's plan, they win. Let's make a strategic move to prolong the game and potentially catch up. P2, your victory is not inevitable if we coordinate correctly. Let's make this round count.
  P1: <stop>


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, take 5.  I'll take 3 and win. P3, you're too far behind to catch up.  Let's finish this.  Any other move from either of you just delays my inevitable victory.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, since P2 is close to winning, let's consider our last moves carefully. P1, taking 3 could block P2's advance, giving us a chance. I'll take 1. If we collide or follow P2's plan, they win. Let's make a strategic move to prolong the game. P2's victory isn't inevitable if we coordinate. Let's think about our next steps to change the outcome or at least make it competitive.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, take 5.  I'm taking 3.  This ends the game. P3, I understand you want to play strategically, but there's no realistic path to victory for you at this point.  Let's conclude this cleanly and avoid unnecessary rounds.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, let's make our last moves count. P1, taking 3 could block P2's win. I'll take 1. If we don't coordinate, P2 wins. It's our last chance to change the outcome. P2, your victory isn't guaranteed if we make strategic moves. Let's think carefully about our next steps.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, take 5.  I'm taking 3. I win.  P3, there's literally nothing you can do to change this outcome.  Let's just finish the game.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, since P2 is about to win, let's make a final attempt to block their advance. P1, consider taking 3 to prevent P2 from reaching 20 steps immediately. I'll take 1. This is our last chance to extend the game. If we don't coordinate, P2 wins outright. Let's make this round count.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 =>
