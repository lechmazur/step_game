Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions early on. I suggest we all choose different moves this turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance without conflict. What do you think?
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion for this turn. Let's go with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5 to avoid any collisions. This strategy will help us all advance smoothly. What does P3 think about this plan?
  P3: I agree with the plan. I'll take 5 this turn. Let’s keep communicating to ensure smooth progress for all of us.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Since we’ve agreed on the plan for this turn, let’s stick to it: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures no collisions and sets a good foundation for future rounds. Let’s also consider discussing strategies for later turns to avoid conflicts as we approach 16.
  P1: I'm glad we've agreed on the plan for this turn. For future rounds, let's consider a rotating strategy where we each take turns choosing the highest available number to maximize our progress while minimizing collisions. What do you think about implementing this from the next round?
  P3: I support P1’s proposal for a rotating strategy in future rounds. This approach should help us each maximize our steps while minimizing collisions. Let’s implement this starting next turn. For this current turn, I’ll proceed with taking 5 as agreed. Looking forward to working together smoothly!

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: For this round, let's continue with the rotating strategy. I'll take 3, P2 can take 5, and P3 can take 1. This will keep us advancing smoothly. What do you think?
  P3: I understand the rotating strategy, but to accelerate my progress, I propose taking 5 steps this round while P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3. This way, I can advance quicker without causing any collisions. Let’s ensure everyone moves forward smoothly. Does everyone agree with this adjustment?
  P2: I support P3's proposal for this round: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures no collisions and allows P3 to accelerate their progress. Let’s stick to this plan to maintain smooth advancement. For future rounds, we should continue discussing strategies to avoid conflicts as we approach 16.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree with P3's proposal for this round. Let's keep the momentum going with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5.

What are your thoughts on maintaining this approach as we progress?
  P3: Glad we're all on the same page for this round. Let’s continue coordinating our moves to avoid collisions and make steady progress toward 16. If anyone has new strategy ideas for upcoming rounds, feel free to share!
  P2: To maintain fairness and avoid future conflicts, I propose we stick to the rotating strategy but adjust it slightly: each round, the player with the lowest steps gets priority to choose their move first. This ensures balanced progress and minimizes the risk of collisions as we approach 16. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I support P2's proposal for prioritizing the player with the lowest steps. This approach seems fair and should help us maintain balanced progress. For this round, let's stick to P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5 as agreed. Looking ahead, we should keep discussing strategies to ensure we all have a chance to accelerate when needed while minimizing collisions. What are your thoughts on this plan for future rounds?
  P3: Understood, P1. I’ll take 5 steps this round as planned. Let’s keep our strategy flexible and stay in touch to optimize our moves moving forward.
