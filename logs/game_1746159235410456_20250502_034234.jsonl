Both of you insisting on picking 5 will only result in collisions, and neither of you will advance. This benefits no one. Let's break this cycle: P1, if you pick 3, you block P2's 5, and I'll pick 1 to avoid any collisions. This move keeps the game competitive and gives us all a chance to strategize better for the next round. P2, your plan is risky and relies on P1's cooperation, which is uncertain. Rethink your strategy. Let's ensure fairness and keep the game going. Good luck to both of you! Let's move forward."}
