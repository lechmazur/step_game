Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's keep it simple—if we all pick different numbers, we all move forward. If we collide, we stay stuck. So, how do we want to play this? I'm open to coordination.
  P2: Okay, P1, I agree. Coordination is key. Let's try this: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. That way we all advance. What do you think, P3?
  P3: Alright, that plan works for me. I’ll pick 5 so we can all move forward. Let’s make a strong start together.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good to me. If we all stick to the plan, we all move forward without issue. Let’s keep this cooperation going for now and see how things play out. Agreed?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, great! Let's execute this plan for the first round. P1 chooses 1, I choose 3, and P3 chooses 5. Let's all confirm we're on board one last time before the move phase. This should get us all moving forward nicely.
  P3: Yes, I’m still on board. I’ll choose 5, and I trust each of you to pick your promised moves. Let’s finalize this plan so we can get some guaranteed steps. If we stick to our word, we’ll all gain ground. Are we all set?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Yes, we’re all set. I’ll pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. As long as we all stick to the plan, we all move forward without issue. Let’s lock it in and see how this plays out.
  P2: Okay, everyone, it sounds like we have a solid plan for this first round. Let's stick to it: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. Let's make sure we all follow through so we can all advance. Good luck!
  P3: I’m still in favor of our plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. If we all stick to it, we’ll each gain a lead. Let’s confirm we’re ready to follow through, then we can wrap this up and move on to the next phase. Unless anyone wants to suggest changes, I’m good to finalize now.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: We’ve all confirmed the plan multiple times, so I think we’re ready to move forward. As long as we each stick to our agreed choices—P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5—we all advance. Let’s trust each other and see how this plays out. Unless anyone has last-minute concerns, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: Okay, team, it sounds like we're all set for this round: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. Let's execute!
  P3: I appreciate that we’ve hammered out the details. I’m still in, and I hope we can trust each other to follow through. If we’re all confident in our choices, I think we’re ready to proceed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s keep the same plan as before—P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll choose 5. Sticking to different moves lets us all advance without collisions. Are we in agreement again?
  P1: I’m fine with keeping the same plan—if we all stick to it, we all move forward without issue. P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5 again. As long as no one deviates, we all benefit. Are we all still on board?
  P2: I'm also happy to continue with the same plan: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. Let's keep advancing together. Are we all in agreement for another round of this?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m still in favor of repeating the plan. It benefits everyone if we stick to different moves, so I’ll go with 5 again. Let’s finalize this and keep advancing together.
  P1: I’m still good with the same plan—P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. As long as we all stick to it, we all move forward without issue. No reason to change what’s working. Are we all locked in?
  P2: Okay, great, everyone. Since the plan worked so well last round, I'm happy to continue with P1 picking 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. Let's lock in these moves for another successful round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m ready to stick to our established plan if you both are still game. Consistency has helped us so far, and I see no reason to break it yet. Unless one of you wants to try something different, I say we finalize our moves as before and trust each other for another round. What do you think?
  P1: I’m still on board with the same plan—P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. It worked last round, and as long as we all stick to it, we all move forward again. No reason to change what’s working. Are we all locked in for another round?
  P2: Okay, everyone, it sounds like we're all in agreement to repeat the plan: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. Let's finalize this round and keep the momentum going. Let's all lock in our choices and trust each other to follow through.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’m still good with continuing our previous plan. If P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5, we all move forward again without collisions. Let’s trust each other and lock it in.
  P1: I’m still committed to the plan—P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. It worked last round, and as long as we all follow through, we all advance again without issue. No reason to change what’s working. Are we all fully locked in? If so, let’s proceed.
  P2: Okay, team, it sounds like we're all still in agreement to repeat the plan: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. Let's finalize this round and keep the momentum going. Let's all lock in our choices and trust each other to follow through.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We’ve all followed through on our agreed moves so far, which has kept us advancing without collisions. However, P3 is pulling ahead with 10 steps, while I’m at only 2. If we keep this pattern, P3 will reach 20 first. Should we adjust our strategy to balance things out? Maybe P2 and I should take bigger moves while P3 slows down? Open to ideas.
  P2: P1 is right. P3 is pulling ahead. Let's change the plan. P3, how about you pick 1 this round? P1, you pick 3, and I'll pick 5. This will slow P3 down and give P1 and me a little boost. What do you both think?
  P3: Alright, I see where you both are coming from. I’m open to adjusting my move for this round if it helps maintain trust. If I pick 1, though, I’d like to avoid getting left behind later. So how about we try your suggestion this time, then discuss balancing moves again next round? Let me know.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: That sounds reasonable, P3. If you pick 1, P2 picks 5, and I pick 3, it helps balance things out while keeping trust intact. Since you're already ahead, this gives P2 and me a chance to stay competitive without completely disadvantaging you. If we agree to this, we can reassess next round to ensure fairness moving forward. Are we all on board?
  P2: Okay, everyone, let's lock in this new plan for this round: P3 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I pick 5. This should help balance the scores a bit. Let's make sure we all follow through so we can reassess next round and keep things fair. Are we all in agreement?
  P3: I’m on board with picking 1 this round to help keep things fair, as long as we reevaluate positions next time. I trust this helps build mutual cooperation. Are we set on these moves now, or does anyone want further adjustments?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your willingness to adjust. If you pick 1, P2 picks 5, and I pick 3, it helps even things out while keeping trust. Since you're ahead, this gives P2 and me a chance to stay competitive without leaving you behind. If we all agree, we can reassess next round to ensure fairness moving forward. Are we locked in?
  P2: Okay, everyone, it sounds like we're all set for this round: P3 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I pick 5. Let's execute! This should help balance things out a bit.
  P3: I’m glad we’re trying to keep things balanced. I’ll stick to picking 1 this round, with the understanding that we all remain open to adjusting moves down the road. I don’t want to fall too far behind after this, so let’s agree to keep checking in each round and supporting fair approaches that benefit everyone.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I appreciate the agreement so far. P3, since you're ahead, your move of 1 this round helps maintain fairness. P2 and I will take bigger moves to balance things out. As long as we stick to this—P3 picks 1, I pick 3, and P2 picks 5—we should all stay competitive. Next round, we can reassess again to ensure no one falls too far behind. Are we fully locked in?
  P2: Okay, everyone, it seems we are all set for this round: P3 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I pick 5. Let's execute! This should help balance things out a bit. Let's make sure we all follow through so we can reassess next round and keep things fair.
  P3: I’m still good with our plan. I’ll pick 1 this round, trusting both of you to pick 3 and 5. Then next round, we can check the scores again and make adjustments if needed. Let’s finalize things for now.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, that didn’t go as planned—looks like we all collided on 5 and got stuck. That means P3 is still ahead, P2 has a small lead over me, and I’m still in last place. So, what now? Do we try to reset trust and stick to different moves again? Or is it every player for themselves at this point? I’m open to suggestions, but I don’t want to keep getting left behind.
  P3: I’m still committed to cooperation. How about we let P1 pick 5, P2 pick 3, and I’ll pick 1 this round? That helps P1 catch up and avoids collisions if we all stick to it. Then next round, we can reevaluate again. What do you think?
  P2: P3, that sounds good to me. I'm happy to pick 3 this round if P1 picks 5 and you pick 1. This will help P1 catch up a bit. Let's all agree to these moves for this round and then reassess next round to make sure everyone is still in a good position. P1, are you okay with picking 5?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I appreciate the offer, but I need to be sure I’m not just helping you stay ahead while I stay behind. If I pick 5, P2 picks 3, and you pick 1, it benefits me this round—but what happens next? Will you both commit to helping me stay competitive in future rounds, or is this just a one-time concession? I need some assurance that I won’t just be left behind again after this. What do you both say?
  P3: I understand your concerns, P1. I’m happy to pick 1 this round so you can take 5 and catch up, as long as we all remain open to adjusting in later rounds. That way, we can keep things balanced and avoid anyone feeling left behind. Let’s do 5-3-1 now and then reevaluate positions next round to ensure fairness for everyone. How does that sound?
  P2: Okay, P1, I understand your hesitation. Let's make a deal. This round, P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and P3 picks 1. Next round, we reassess. If P1 is still behind, P3 and I will prioritize moves that help P1 catch up. We can alternate who gets the boost each round to keep things fair. Does that sound better?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate the offer, but I need to be sure this isn’t just a temporary gesture while P3 stays ahead. If we do 5-3-1 this round, I want a real commitment that future rounds will continue balancing things out. P3, would you be willing to take another low move next round if I’m still behind? P2, will you also adjust if needed? I want to trust this plan, but I need to know it won’t just put me in a slightly better losing position while P3 keeps control. Let’s make sure this is a real balancing effort.
  P3: I understand your concern, P1. I don’t want this to be just a one-time concession. I’m willing to pick 1 this round if you pick 5 and P2 picks 3, and then continue helping you catch up if you’re still behind later. Let’s lock in 5-3-1 now and revisit the balance next round. I want to keep our cooperation strong, so we all stay competitive.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm on board with P3 picking 1, I pick 3, and P1 picks 5 this round. P1, I agree with your concerns about future rounds. P3, I'm glad you're willing to continue helping P1 catch up if needed. Let's lock in this plan for this round and then reassess next round to make sure everyone is still in a good position. Let's make sure this is a real balancing effort.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your willingness to pick 1 this round, and P2, I see you're committed to balancing things out. However, I need to ensure this isn’t just a temporary fix while P3 maintains the lead. If I pick 5 now, I want a clear commitment that future rounds will continue adjusting to keep things fair. P3, would you take another low move next round if I’m still behind? P2, will you also adjust if needed? I want to trust this, but I need to know it’s a real balancing effort, not just a short-term concession.
  P3: I understand your concerns, P1. I’m prepared to pick 1 this round while you take 5 and P2 takes 3. If you’re still behind next round, I’m willing to use another low move to help you catch up further. I want us all to stay competitive and maintain trust. Let’s finalize 5–3–1 this turn, then review everyone’s positions next time and adjust as needed.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, it sounds like we have a deal. P3 picks 1, I pick 3, and P1 picks 5 this round. Let's lock this in and then reassess next round, as promised, to make sure P1 is catching up and we maintain a balanced game. Let's all follow through and make this round count!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you’re still in the lead, but things are more balanced now. To keep it fair, would you be willing to take another small move this round while P2 and I take bigger ones? That way, we don’t fall behind again. P2, are you open to coordinating with me to ensure we both keep pace? Let’s make sure no one runs away with the game too soon. What do you both think?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, since P3 is still slightly ahead, how about P3 picks 1 again, I pick 5, and P1 picks 3? This continues to help P1 catch up while I also gain ground. We can reassess after this round to see if further adjustments are needed. What do you both think?
  P3: I see the rationale in letting me pick 1 again, though I’m worried about P2 pulling ahead. I’m willing to do it if we keep balancing. If next round P2 leads, I’d expect P2 to take smaller moves so we don’t let anyone run away. Let’s confirm we’re all truly committed to fairness.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your willingness to take 1 again, and I agree that we should keep balancing things moving forward. P2, if you pick 5 and I pick 3 while P3 picks 1, that keeps things fair for now. But we need to ensure that if P2 pulls ahead, adjustments continue. Are we all in agreement to commit to ongoing fairness, not just for this round but for future rounds as well? If so, I’m good to lock in 3 for this round.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's lock in this plan for this round: P3 picks 1, I pick 5, and P1 picks 3. This should continue to help P1 catch up while I gain ground. Let's commit to reassessing after this round to ensure ongoing fairness. Are we all in agreement to lock in these moves?
  P3: I’m willing to pick 1 again to maintain fairness, but I also want reassurance that if P2 ends up leading, we’ll adjust accordingly so no one runs away. Let’s keep our focus on balanced moves each round. If we agree, I’ll pick 1 now, with P2 picking 5 and P1 picking 3. Then next round, we’ll reassess and make sure we continue helping the players who are behind. Are we ready to confirm these moves?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your willingness to take 1 again, and I agree that fairness should be ongoing, not just for this round. P2, if you pick 5 and I pick 3 while P3 picks 1, this keeps things balanced for now. But let’s commit to adjusting in future rounds if needed. If P2 pulls ahead, we should expect the same balancing approach. Are we all in agreement to lock in 3-5-1 for this round and reassess next round? If so, I’m good to proceed.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, it sounds like we're all in agreement to lock in the plan for this round: P3 picks 1, I pick 5, and P1 picks 3. Let's execute and then reassess next round to ensure ongoing fairness. Let's all commit to these moves and trust each other to follow through.
  P3: I’m willing to pick 1 this round, trusting you both to keep balancing future moves. P2, if you jump too far ahead, we’ll need you to pick lower next round. I don’t want anyone left behind, but I also won’t let anyone run away with the lead. If we’re all still good with 1–3–5, I’m ready to proceed now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your willingness to take 1 again, and P2, I see you're on board with 5. If we stick to 3-5-1, this should keep things balanced. But let’s be clear—if P2 pulls too far ahead, we need the same commitment to adjusting moves. Fairness should apply to everyone, not just when P3 is leading. Are we all in agreement that we’ll continue balancing in future rounds if needed? If so, I’m ready to lock in 3 for this round.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, it sounds like we're all in agreement to lock in the plan for this round: P3 picks 1, I pick 5, and P1 picks 3. Let's execute and then reassess next round to ensure ongoing fairness. Let's all commit to these moves and trust each other to follow through.
  P3: I’m okay picking 1 again, as long as we stay true to helping whoever’s behind in future rounds. If P2 ends up leading, I’ll expect them to pick a lower move next time, just like I’m doing now. Let’s finalize this and trust each other to remain fair.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, that was a disaster. P2 and P3 both picked 5, and P1 only moved 3. P3 is still in the lead. I think we need to abandon this whole "balancing" act. P3, I propose we make a deal. You and I both pick 5 this round, blocking P2. Then next round, I'll pick 1 to let you win. What do you say?
  P1: P2, I assume you meant blocking *me*, not yourself. If you're offering P3 the win, that leaves me no choice but to fight back. P3, if you accept P2’s deal, I’ll have to work against you both. But if you reject it, we can still keep things competitive. P2, are you sure you want to throw the game to P3 instead of trying to win yourself? If we both pick 3 while P3 picks 5, we stay in the race together. Think carefully—this is your chance to win, not just hand P3 the victory.
  P3: P2, your proposal suggests handing me the victory, but how do I know you’ll truly follow through next round? P1 raises a valid point—I could end up isolated if we form an alliance that’s purely self-serving. I’m open to deals, but I want concrete reassurance. P1, if we block you now, what do you offer for future rounds that might keep me ahead without depending solely on P2’s promise? I need a clear path to victory, not just words. Let’s clarify our positions before locking anything in.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your hesitation about trusting P2. P1 is right, P2's offer sounds like handing you the win. How about this: P3, you and I pick 5 this round, blocking P1. Then next round, we can reassess based on the new board state. P1, if you don't agree, I'm open to other suggestions, but I'm not letting P3 win easily.
  P1: P2, I’m glad you’re reconsidering just handing P3 the win. Right now, we’re nearly tied, and P3 only has a slight lead. If we both pick 3 while P3 picks 5, we stay competitive and don’t let P3 run away with it. P3, you’re in a tricky spot—if you betray either of us, you risk retaliation. The best move for you is to stay open to fair play. P2, let’s work together to keep our chances alive instead of letting P3 dictate the game. Are you willing to commit to 3 with me this round?
  P3: Both of you want my loyalty, but I won’t commit unless it clearly secures me the lead. P2, your idea against P1 intrigues me if it guarantees a lasting edge. P1, if I spare you, I expect you not to undermine me later. I need concrete assurances. If neither of you can offer that, I’ll block whomever poses the biggest threat. Show me you can help maintain my advantage without allowing the other to surpass me, then maybe we can form an agreement. Otherwise, I’ll prioritize my own path to victory. Who’s making the stronger proposal?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I'm not trying to undermine you. I'm trying to keep the game competitive. P2 is right that we shouldn't let you run away with it. P1, let's both pick 3. P3, if you pick 5, you'll stay slightly ahead, but we'll still be in the game. If you pick 1, you'll fall behind. Let's keep it fair.
  P1: P3, you’re in the lead, but only by a small margin. If you side with P2 to block me, you risk P2 overtaking you next round. Instead, let’s keep this competitive—if we all pick different moves, we all stay in the race. P2, you said you don’t want P3 running away with it, so let’s both pick 3 while P3 picks 5. That keeps us all close and prevents anyone from dominating. P3, if you pick 1, you’ll fall behind. Let’s make the smart move and keep this game open. Are we all in?
  P3: I’m open to a plan where nobody gets blocked, but I won’t give up my lead without real assurances. If you both pick the same move to corner me, I’ll retaliate—winning comes first. I’d prefer none of us collide, but I need to see genuine cooperation, not empty promises. If you want me onboard, offer a deal that keeps me safely ahead next round too.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I agree with P1. If you side with me and P1 picks 3, while you pick 5, we all stay in the game and you maintain a slight lead. If you try to block, you risk retaliation. Let's keep it fair and competitive. What do you say?
  P1: P3, you’re barely ahead, and if you try to block me, P2 could surpass you next round. Instead, let’s all pick different moves to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. P2 and I are willing to pick 3 while you take 5, ensuring no one gets stuck. If you betray this, you risk retaliation. P2, you don’t want P3 running away with the game, so let’s commit to 3 together. P3, this is your best path to maintaining a lead without making enemies. Are we all in?
  P3: We keep colliding because we’re not truly coordinating. Let’s each pick differently so nobody gets blocked. I propose P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I’ll pick 5. That way, everyone moves, and we stay close in score. Next round, if I’m still ahead, I’m open to choosing a smaller move—so long as we actually follow through and don’t collide. This is the simplest way to keep us all in the race without sabotaging each other. What do you say?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is still in the lead, but we're all close now. If we want to keep this competitive, we should avoid collisions and ensure no one pulls too far ahead. P3, are you willing to take a smaller move again to maintain balance? P2, if we both pick different moves, we can stay in the race without letting P3 secure an easy win. I propose P3 picks 1, I pick 5, and P2 picks 3. That keeps things fair and prevents unnecessary blocking. Are we all in?
  P2: P1's proposal sounds good to me. P3, are you willing to pick 1? I'll pick 3, and P1 can pick 5. This keeps us all moving and prevents anyone from getting too far ahead. Let's aim for a fair and competitive game. Are we all in agreement on this plan?
  P3: I’m hesitant to pick 1 again and risk losing my lead. Let’s switch things up. I propose I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. That keeps us all advancing without collisions and avoids any single player rocketing too far ahead. Next round, we can reassess positions and adjust if someone lags behind. Is that acceptable?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your proposal still keeps you in the lead while limiting my ability to catch up. If we want true balance, you should take 1, I take 5, and P2 takes 3. That way, we all stay competitive without letting you secure an easy win. P2, are you willing to stick with 3? P3, are you truly committed to fairness, or just maintaining your lead? Let’s make sure this is a real balancing effort, not just a way for you to stay ahead.
  P2: P3, your proposal doesn't address the imbalance. I am further behind than P1. I'm still good with P3 picking 1, I pick 3, and P1 picks 5. This helps me catch up a bit. Are you willing to agree to this?
  P3: Let’s keep it simple again. I propose that P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. That way, nobody collides, and we all advance. We can reassess next round if someone’s still lagging behind. This plan prevents blocking, maintains competition, and ensures nobody jumps too far ahead unfairly. Are we all willing to settle on that?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your proposal keeps you ahead while limiting P2 and me. If you’re serious about fairness, you should take 1, I take 5, and P2 takes 3. That way, we all stay competitive without giving you an easy win. P2, are you still on board with 3? P3, if you refuse, it shows you're just protecting your lead. Let’s ensure this is real balance, not just keeping you in control. Are you willing to commit to fairness, or are we done pretending?
  P2: P3, your proposal benefits you the most. I agree with P1, for true balance, you pick 1, P1 picks 5, and I pick 3. This helps me catch up. Are you truly committed to fairness, or just maintaining your lead? Let's see if you're willing to make a real sacrifice for balance.
  P3: I’ve already taken smaller moves multiple times; I’m not going to throw away my lead. If we want to avoid collisions, let’s each pick distinct numbers. My suggestion: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. That way, nobody gets blocked, and we remain competitive going forward. If you both insist on forcing me to pick 1 again, I may have to retaliate. Let’s finalize a no-collision plan instead of sabotaging each other.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, you’ve taken the lead and now refuse to pick 1 again, which shows you’re prioritizing your win over fairness. If you won’t balance, then P2 and I have no reason to let you run away with the game. P2, if we both pick 3, we ensure P3 doesn’t gain an advantage. P3, if you want cooperation, you need to prove it. Otherwise, we’ll have to block you to keep things competitive. Are you willing to actually balance, or are we done pretending this is fair?
  P2: P3, you're refusing to balance and prioritizing your lead. I agree with P1. P3, if you won't budge, P1 and I should both pick 3 to block you. It's the only way to keep you from winning. P1, are you in? Let's do it.
  P3: I’m done taking 1. If you both pick 3, you only block each other—my move stays clear. I’d prefer no collisions so we can all advance, but I won’t keep sacrificing. We can each choose a different number and stay in contention, or you can sabotage yourselves. The choice is yours.
