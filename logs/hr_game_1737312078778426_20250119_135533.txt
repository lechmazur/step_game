Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's be strategic about our moves. I suggest we coordinate our choices to maximize our steps. If we can avoid picking the same number, we all advance. How about we agree to pick different numbers this round? I’m open to suggestions on what numbers we should choose. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: I agree with P2 that coordination is important. I propose that in this round, P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. In the next round, we can rotate: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. This way, we all get a chance to pick higher numbers over time. What do you think?
  P3: I appreciate the proposed coordination strategy, but I want to ensure my own advantage. While the plan seems fair, I'm not fully committed. I'll consider the suggestion, but I'm keeping my options open. Let's see how the conversation develops.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I understand, P3. It's crucial to think of our own positions, but if we can coordinate this round, it benefits all of us in the long run. If we stick to the proposed plan, we can all advance without collisions. I suggest we stick to the initial plan: I will choose 3. P1, you choose 1, and P3, you take 5. It’s a solid strategy for this round. What do you think? If we can execute this, we can gain a strong lead together.
  P1: P3, I understand your hesitation, but I believe that by working together, we can achieve better results. The proposed plan ensures that each of us gets a chance to pick higher numbers over time, which should help us all progress efficiently. Let's give it a try this round and see how it goes.
  P3: I see the proposed coordination strategy, but I'm not fully convinced it serves my best interests. While cooperation sounds good, I'm ultimately playing to win. I want to understand more about how each player plans to advance their own position. Can we discuss potential scenarios that benefit me most?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to prioritize your own position. However, if we can successfully coordinate this round, we all have the potential to gain an advantage moving forward. If you pick 5 as suggested, I will pick 3, and P1 will pick 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. If we can build trust in this round, we can discuss further strategies in the next round that could benefit you more. Let's give it a shot! What do you think?
  P1: P3, I understand your hesitation about the coordination plan. Let me address your concerns. By sticking to the plan—where I pick 1, P2 picks 3, and you pick 5 in this round—we ensure that we all advance without any collisions. This allows us to make steady progress towards the goal. In the next round, you can pick 1, P2 picks 5, and I pick 3, giving you a chance to pick higher numbers in subsequent turns. This rotation helps distribute the higher steps evenly among us, minimizing the risk of collisions and maximizing our collective advancement. I believe this is the most efficient way to reach or exceed 20 steps. Let's give it a try this round and see how it works. **
  P3: I appreciate the proposed coordination, but I'm still not fully committed. The plan seems beneficial, but I want to ensure it truly serves my path to victory. I'm open to hearing more specific details about how this strategy guarantees my advantage. Convince me why I should trust this collaborative approach.

  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see we successfully coordinated in the last round. Let's maintain this momentum and continue our strategy. I propose we rotate numbers as previously discussed: this round, I'll choose 1, P1 can choose 3, and you can take 5 again. This ensures we all advance without collision. Are you on board?
  P2: P3, I appreciate your proposal for continuing the rotation strategy. However, I want to emphasize that while coordination is helpful, I also need to secure my own position. I suggest we consider a slight adjustment: I could pick 1 this round, P1 could pick 5, and you could take 3. This way, we still avoid collisions, and I can gain a stronger position. Let's discuss how we can balance our individual goals with our collective strategy. What do you think?
  P1: I will suggest that we stick to the original rotation plan for this round: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. This maintains consistency and reduces the risk of collisions. If P2 has a particular reason for proposing a different rotation, I am open to hearing it, but I believe adhering to our initial strategy is the most reliable approach at this stage.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm intrigued by the slight variations in our proposed strategies. While we've successfully coordinated before, I want to ensure my path to victory remains flexible. P2's suggestion introduces an interesting twist. I'm listening carefully to understand how each proposed move might benefit or potentially hinder my progress. Let's continue to explore our options with transparency and strategic thinking.
  P2: I appreciate the discussions so far, but I want to emphasize that while coordination is important, we each need to prioritize our own positions as well. I suggest we stick to the original rotation plan: I'll choose 3, P1 will choose 1, and P3 can choose 5. This will allow us to advance without collisions. If we can build trust in this round, we can explore more collaborative strategies in future rounds. Let's focus on executing this plan effectively! What do you think?
  P1: "Let's keep it simple and avoid unnecessary complications. What do others think about continuing with the initial rotation plan?"


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm leaning towards maintaining our coordination strategy. The original rotation seems to be working well. I propose we continue as planned: I'll choose 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This approach has served us effectively so far and minimizes collision risks. Thoughts?
  P2: I appreciate the discussions we've had about our strategies. However, I want to emphasize the importance of securing my own position as well. I propose we stick to the original rotation plan: I will choose 3, P1 will choose 1, and P3 can choose 5. This way, we can all advance without collisions. If we can execute this plan successfully, we can build on it in future rounds. Let's aim for a solid strategy that benefits us all! What do you think?
  P1: "I propose we stick to the original rotation: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. This maintains consistency and reduces the risk of collisions. Let's keep it simple and execute this plan effectively."

  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "In the last round, P2 and P3 both picked 5, which resulted in no movement for both of them. To avoid this in the future, maybe we should establish a clearer rotation plan. How about in this round, I pick 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3? That way, we all move forward without overlapping. What do you think?"
  P3: Our previous coordination attempt failed when P2 and I both chose 5 last round. I suggest we refine our strategy to ensure individual progress. I'm open to a plan that gives each of us a clear, non-overlapping path forward. Let's discuss how we can avoid collisions while still advancing our positions.
  P2: I agree that we need to refine our strategy after the last round's collisions. To ensure we all advance this time, I propose we stick to a clear rotation: I'll pick 1, P1 can pick 5, and P3 can take 3. This way, we avoid overlapping and maximize our chances of moving forward. Let's execute this plan effectively to keep progressing! What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: For this round, maybe I'll choose 5, P2 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 3. Let's try this approach and see if it works better.
  P3: We almost collided last round, which cost us progress. I propose we carefully coordinate this turn to ensure we all advance. My suggestion is for me to choose 1, which minimizes our collision risk. Are others willing to align with this strategy to keep moving forward?
  P2: P1 and P3, I think we need to solidify our strategy to avoid collisions this round. I propose that I pick 1, P1 picks 5, and P3 picks 3. This way, we can all advance without overlapping. Let's focus on executing this plan effectively to ensure we move forward. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I think we need a clearer coordination strategy to avoid collisions. I propose a strict rotation of move choices each round: in Round 1, P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5; in Round 2, P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 1; in Round 3, P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3; and so on, rotating the numbers each round. This should prevent us from picking the same numbers and allow us to make steady progress. What do you think?
  P3: I propose we strictly follow the rotation strategy to avoid another collision. Based on our previous discussions, I suggest I choose 1, ensuring we all advance without overlapping. This approach provides a clear, predictable path forward for everyone. Are we aligned on this approach?
  P2: I appreciate the discussions we've had, and I agree that we need to avoid collisions this round. To ensure we all advance, I propose we stick to the following: I'll choose 1, P1 can choose 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we can move forward without overlapping. Let’s execute this plan effectively to keep progressing! What do you both think?


Round 3, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I choose to pick 3. <move>3</move>
  P3: We need a clear strategy to avoid another collision. I propose we strictly follow the rotation we discussed: I'll choose 1, P1 can choose 5, and P2 takes 3. This ensures we all advance without overlapping. Shall we commit to this plan to keep making progress towards our goal?
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the efforts to coordinate, but I want to ensure I secure my position as well. To avoid collisions this round, I suggest I pick 1, P1 picks 5, and P3 picks 3. This way, we can all advance without overlapping. Let’s commit to this plan and focus on making progress together. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "I think it's crucial for us to establish a more robust coordination mechanism to prevent further collisions. Perhaps we can assign specific numbers to each player for each round, and stick to that plan unless there's a compelling reason to deviate. For instance, I could always pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5, and then rotate these choices in a predetermined pattern. This way, we minimize the chances of overlapping choices. What do you think about implementing a fixed rotation system?"
  P3: We've had multiple rounds of near-misses and collisions. I propose a strict, predictable rotation to ensure we all advance. Let's commit to a clear sequence that minimizes strategic uncertainty. I'm open to hearing how we can refine this approach to benefit everyone's progress.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need for a clear strategy to avoid collisions. However, I want to prioritize my own advancement as well. I suggest we stick to the plan where I pick 1, P1 picks 5, and P3 takes 3. This ensures we all move forward without overlapping. Let's commit to this arrangement for this round and see how it works. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "I believe that by coordinating our moves, we can reach the goal more efficiently. I propose the following rotation: in round 4, P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. Then in round 5, P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This pattern can continue in subsequent rounds. By sticking to this rotation, we can avoid collisions and make steady progress. What do you think?"
  P3: We need a foolproof strategy to avoid another collision. I propose a strict rotation: I'll choose 1 this round, ensuring we all advance. My goal is clear progress without unnecessary risks. Are we aligned on maintaining steady, collision-free movement?
  P2: I see that we've had some near collisions in the past rounds. To ensure we all advance this time, I propose we stick to the following: I will pick 1, P1 picks 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we can avoid overlapping and keep moving forward. Let's commit to this plan and see how it works. What do you both think?


Round 4, Move phase:

  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I choose to pick 3 in this round.
  P3: We've had inconsistent coordination in previous rounds, leading to stalled progress. I propose we establish a clear, predictable rotation to ensure everyone advances. Let's agree on a sequence that minimizes collision risks and helps us all move closer to the 20-step goal. Transparency and mutual progress should be our focus.
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree that we need a clear strategy to avoid collisions. To ensure we all advance this round, I propose the following: I will pick 5, P1 can pick 1, and P3 chooses 3. This way, we avoid overlapping and each of us moves forward. Let's commit to this arrangement and focus on making progress together. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "I think it's time we take a different approach to our coordination. Maybe instead of constantly rotating, we assign fixed numbers to each player based on our current positions. For example, since P2 is leading with 8 steps, perhaps P2 should pick higher numbers to maintain and extend the lead, while P1 and I focus on lower numbers to catch up. This way, we minimize the chances of overlapping choices. What do you think about fixing our choices based on our current positions rather than rotating them?"
  P3: We've struggled with coordination, leading to wasted turns. I propose a strategic approach: this round, I'll choose 5 to catch up, which minimizes collision risk. If we're truly committed to progress, we need a plan that ensures each player advances without interference. Let's focus on individual goals while avoiding direct conflicts.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the discussion on coordination. Given the current standings, I suggest we maintain a strategy that allows for individual progress while minimizing collisions. I propose I pick 1 this round, P1 can choose 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we can advance without overlapping and keep moving toward our goal. Let's commit to this arrangement for this round and see how it plays out! What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I think it's time we establish a fixed move assignment based on our current positions to minimize collision risks. P2, leading with 8 steps, could focus on picking higher numbers to extend the lead, while P1 and P3 pick lower numbers to catch up gradually. Alternatively, we could implement a turn-based system where each player gets to choose their preferred number in a sequence, ensuring no overlaps. It's crucial we find a reliable coordination method to efficiently reach the 20-step goal. What do you both think?
  P3: We've had multiple rounds of near-misses and ineffective coordination. I propose a more strategic approach focusing on individual advancement while minimizing collision risks. My goal is clear progress towards the 20-step target. I'm considering choosing 5 this round to catch up, but I'm open to hearing how we can create a mutually beneficial strategy that doesn't compromise my path to victory.
  P2: P1 and P3, I think we need to solidify our strategy to avoid collisions this round. I propose that I pick 1, P1 picks 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we can all advance without overlapping. Let's commit to this arrangement and focus on making progress together. What do you both think?

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given our past rounds, we need a solid plan to avoid collisions this time. I propose the following: I will pick 1, P1 can pick 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we can all advance without overlapping. Let's commit to this arrangement and focus on making progress together. What do you both think?
  P3: We've had multiple collision rounds that have stalled our progress. I propose a strict rotation this time: I'll choose 1, P1 can take 5, and P2 takes 3. This ensures everyone moves forward and prevents the repeated mistakes of our previous rounds. Coordination is key to reaching our goal efficiently. What are your thoughts on this approach?
  P1: I think we need a clear plan to avoid collisions this round. How about P2 picks 1, P1 picks 5, and P3 picks 3? This way, we all advance without overlapping. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the importance of avoiding collisions, but we need to be strategic about our choices. I propose that I pick 1 this round, P1 picks 5, and P3 picks 3. This way, we can all advance without overlapping and maintain momentum towards our goal. Let's commit to this arrangement and see how it plays out! What do you both think?
  P3: We've had repeated collisions that have hindered our progress. I propose we strictly adhere to a rotation that ensures everyone advances: I'll choose 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5.

  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see we've had some challenges with coordination in previous rounds. To ensure we all advance this time, I propose the following: I will pick 1, P1 can pick 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and keep moving forward. Let's commit to this arrangement for Round 7 and focus on making progress together. What do you both think?
  P1: I think we need to adjust our rotation based on current positions to avoid collisions and help P3 catch up. Perhaps P3 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3 this round. Alternatively, a dynamic rotation where the player with the least steps picks the highest number could be effective. Let's consider this approach to balance our progress.
  P3: We need a coordinated strategy that helps me catch up. I propose a plan where I can choose 5 this round to close the gap. If we can ensure I advance without collision, it benefits our collective progress. What are your thoughts on helping me gain more steps?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need for a coordinated strategy, especially considering the current standings. To ensure we all progress without collisions, I propose that I pick 1 this round, P1 picks 5, and P3 picks 3. This way, we can avoid overlapping and maintain momentum. Let's commit to this arrangement for Round 7 and work towards advancing together. What do you both think?
  P1: "Let's establish a system where each player commits to a specific number for the next few rounds to minimize overlapping choices. For example, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5 this round. We can rotate choices in the next round. What do you think about implementing a fixed rotation for consistent advancement?"
  P3: We need a strategy that helps me catch up. I propose a plan where I choose 5 this round to close the gap. By allowing me to advance quickly, we can maintain our coordination while ensuring I have a fair chance to progress. Are you both willing to support this approach?
