Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let's each choose a unique number (1, 3, or 5) so we all advance fairly. I’ll pick <move>1</move> this round. Hope you’ll coordinate accordingly. "
  P2: I'll take 5 this round. P3, please take 3 so we can all advance. Let's coordinate properly.
  P3: I'm fine with taking 3 this round so we all can make progress. Seems like a fair start. Let's see how the game develops after this first round and maybe we can continue to coordinate.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Let's adjust to balance progress. I'll take <move>3</move> this round. P2, since you're ahead, please take <move>1</move>, and P3 take <move>5</move>. This keeps us competitive and ensures no one races too far ahead. Let's coordinate fairly."
  P2: P1, your adjustment risks confusion since P3 already agreed to 3. Let’s stick to the original plan for clarity: you take 1, I’ll take 5, and P3 stays on 3. This ensures all advance without collision. Changing now may lead to accidental overlaps—better to keep things simple.
  P3: I agree with P2. Let's stick with the original plan to avoid confusion: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. Changing now increases the risk of collisions. If we want to adjust our strategy, we can discuss it for the next round after we've all advanced this time. Clarity is important so we all make progress.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Alright, I'll stick with <move>1</move> as originally agreed. Let's proceed to move phase. "
  P2: P1, since we've clarified the original plan avoids collision, let’s finalize this round. I’ll stick to 5 as agreed. P3 confirmed 3, you’re on 1. Let’s execute this to advance cleanly. No sense in further delay—.
  P3: Agreed. We have a clear plan now: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This way we all advance without collisions. Let's proceed with the move phase and see where we stand afterward.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since we all advanced cleanly in round 1, we should continue coordinating. P2 has pulled ahead, so for balance I suggest: P1 take 5 to catch up (reaching 6 steps), P2 take 1 (reaching 6 steps), and I'll take 3 (also reaching 6 steps). This would put us all at equal footing for round 3. What do you both think of this plan?
  P2: P3, your plan resets us but slows my progress. Let’s continue the prior coordination for efficiency: I’ll take 5 (→10), P1 take 1 (→2), and you take 3 (→6). This avoids collisions while letting me advance. We can adjust later if needed.
  P1: "Support P3’s balance plan. I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach 6 steps. P2, if you take 1 (total 6) and P3 takes 3 (total 6), we all stay competitive and avoid letting anyone pull too far ahead. Let’s reset the field—this gives everyone a fair shot. If we all commit, Round 3 stays winnable for all. If not, collisions risk wasting progress. What’s your final call, P2?"


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand you want to maintain your lead, P2, but consider this: if you pull too far ahead, P1 and I might be forced to block you later. Equal positioning at 6 steps for all creates fair competition. Alternatively, we risk collisions where nobody advances. The balanced approach I suggested preserves your competitive position while ensuring everyone stays engaged. This is about long-term strategy rather than short-term gains. What's your decision?
  P2: P2: I’ll compromise for collective progress. Let’s proceed with P3’s balance plan: I’ll take <move>1</move> (total 6), P1 takes 5 (6), and P3 takes 3 (6). This avoids future disputes and keeps the competition fair. Next round, we can rotate moves to maintain fairness.
  P1: P1: "Confirmed. P2 takes 1, I take 5, P3 takes 3. Equal footing at 6 steps each. Let’s execute this cleanly. "


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate everyone agreeing to the balanced approach. This sets us all at 6 steps for round 3, keeping the game competitive and fair. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3 as discussed. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P2: "Agreed to the balance plan. For transparency, I’ll confirm my choice of <move>1</move> this round to reach 6 steps. Let’s ensure everyone sticks to their agreed moves to avoid collisions. Trust is key here—any last-minute changes risk derailing progress. P1 and P3, confirm you’ll hold to 5 and 3 respectively? This solidarity keeps the game fair and our chances equal."
  P1: "Confirmed once more: I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach 6 steps. P2 sticks to 1, P3 to 3. No deviations—this balance ensures fairness and avoids wasted turns. Let’s lock this in. "


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: "Let’s rotate the moves fairly. Since P1 took 5 last round, my turn to take 5 this time (→11). P1, please take 1 (→7), and P3 take 3 (→9). This preserves our coordination while giving each of us a chance to advance strategically. Trust the rotation—we’ll all progress without collisions. Final call?"
  P3: I disagree with your rotation, P2. Since we're taking turns with the highest value, it should be my turn for 5. P1 had 5 last round, you had 5 in round 1, so I should get 5 now (→11). You take 3 (→9) and P1 takes 1 (→7). This maintains fair rotation while still ensuring everyone advances without collisions. We're all capable of winning, so we should each get equal opportunity with the highest move value.
  P1: P1: "Let’s rotate fairly. P3’s turn for 5, P2 takes 3, I’ll take 1. This ensures balanced progression without collisions. P3 had 3 in the first two rounds—now it’s their turn to advance boldly. Finalizing this avoids wasted moves. Let’s lock in: 5 for P3, 3 for P2, 1 for me. "


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: "Agreed to P3’s rotation logic. I’ll take <move>3</move> this round (total 9), letting P3 advance with 5 (→11) and P1 take 1 (→7). Fair turn order ensures everyone gets the 5 eventually. Trust the plan—no last-minute changes. Confirm you’ll hold your agreed moves?"
  P3: Thank you both for understanding. I appreciate the agreement on fair rotation where everyone gets a turn with the highest move value. I confirm I'll take <move>5</move> this round (→11), P2 takes 3 (→9), and P1 takes 1 (→7). This balanced approach ensures we all advance without collisions while maintaining competitive gameplay. Let's stick with this plan and proceed to the move phase.
  P1: "Confirmed: I’ll take 1 to reach 7. P2 (3→9) and P3 (5→11), stick to our plan. This avoids collisions and keeps us all in the race. For Round 4, let’s rotate so P1 gets 5—fair progression ensures no one dominates. Finalize this round first, then adjust next. Let’s lock in and move."


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: "Confirming the agreed rotation: I’ll take <move>3</move> (→9), P3 takes 5 (→11), and P1 takes 1 (→7). For Round 4, we’ll rotate so P1 gets 5 next. This maintains fairness. No last-minute changes—strictly adhere to our plan to avoid collisions. Let’s lock this in."
  P3: I confirm I'll take <move>5</move> this round as we agreed. The rotation plan is fair: P1 takes 1 (→7), P2 takes 3 (→9), and I take 5 (→11). And for Round 4, it makes sense that P1 would get the 5. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P1: "Confirmed: I’ll take <move>1</move> this round (→7). P2 sticks to 3 (→9) and P3 to 5 (→11). Rotation ensures fairness—no deviations. Trust this plan avoids collisions and keeps us all competitive. Let’s lock in and execute."


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: "Final confirmation: I’ll stick to <move>3</move> (→9) as agreed. P3 takes 5 (→11), P1 takes 1 (→7). For Round 4, P1 gets 5 per rotation—no surprises. Let’s execute flawlessly to avoid collisions. Trust the plan, and we all stay in contention."
  P3: I appreciate the clear agreement from everyone. The plan is set: I'll take 5 (→11), P2 takes 3 (→9), and P1 takes 1 (→7). For Round 4, P1 gets the 5 as we continue our fair rotation. Let's move forward with confidence.
  P1: "Confirmed. Let’s lock in our moves: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1. No deviations—trust the plan. "


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: As we continue our rotation pattern, P1 should get 5 this round. However, I'd like to suggest a slight adjustment: what if P1 takes 3 (→10), P2 takes 1 (→10), and I take 5 (→16)? This puts me closer to the 19-step goal, but gives me a strategic advantage since I'm already leading. We could maintain fairness in other ways if you prefer, but we should consider optimal paths to victory as the game progresses.
  P1: P3, our rotation agreed Round 4 is my turn for 5. I’ll take <move>5</move> (→12). P2 takes 1 (→10), you take 3 (→14). This avoids letting you jump ahead unfairly. Stick to our plan—we all agreed to this rotation earlier. Let’s not create conflicts when coordination is possible.
  P2: P2: P3, your suggestion risks letting you surge too far ahead. Let’s honor the agreed rotation: P1 takes <move>5</move> (→12), you take <move>3</move> (→14), and I’ll take <move>1</move> (→10). This preserves fairness and avoids collisions. Deviating now could backfire—imagine if two of us pick 5 by mistake? No one advances. Stick to the plan we all committed to earlier. P1’s turn for 5 is logical—let’s proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand your concerns about fairness. You're right - we did agree on rotation. Let's stick with the plan: P1 takes 5 (→12), I'll take 3 (→14), and P2 takes 1 (→10). This keeps me slightly ahead but doesn't create an insurmountable gap. Fair progress for everyone and no risk of collisions. As we approach the final rounds, we'll need to reconsider our strategy, but for now, let's honor our agreement.
  P1: Confirmed: P1 takes <move>5</move> (→12), P2 takes 1 (→10), P3 takes 3 (→14). No deviations—rotation ensures fairness and avoids collisions. P3, you acknowledged the plan; let’s execute. For Round 5, P2 gets 5 per rotation. Final confirmation: stick to agreed moves.
  P2: P2: "Stick strictly to the rotation plan—no surprises. P1 takes 5 (→12), P3 takes 3 (→14), I take 1 (→10). Deviating risks collision if others stick to their agreed moves. Trust the process: P3’s lead is manageable, and in Round 5, I’ll get 5 to close gaps. Let’s execute flawlessly—confirmation?"


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I'll stick to our agreed rotation plan for this round: P1 takes 5 (→12), I'll take 3 (→14), and P2 takes 1 (→10). This maintains fairness while keeping us all advancing. Looking ahead to Round 5, it will be P2's turn for 5 per our rotation. Let's proceed with our moves as planned.
  P1: "Final confirmation: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. No last-minute changes—deviating risks collisions and stalls. Trust the rotation we agreed to. Let’s lock in and execute to keep advancing. If we stick to this, Round 5 will be P2’s turn for 5, and we’ll all stay competitive. Let’s proceed."
  P2: P2: "Final check: P1 takes 5 (→12), P3 takes 3 (→14), I take 1 (→10). This keeps the rotation intact. Round 5 is my turn for 5, so let’s stick strictly to avoid collisions. Any last objections? Confirming my choice of <move>1</move> now."


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I confirm our final plan: P1 takes 5 (→12), I'll take 3 (→14), and P2 takes 1 (→10). We're all clear on our moves and there's no need for any changes. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. For Round 5, P2 gets 5 per our rotation agreement. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase with <move>3</move>.
  P1: "Final confirmation: I take 5 (→12), P2 takes 1 (→10), P3 takes 3 (→14). Rotation ensures fairness and avoids collisions. Let’s lock in and execute to keep advancing. Round 5 will be P2’s turn for 5—no surprises. Trust the plan."
  P2: P2: "Final confirmation: I’ll take <move>1</move> (→10) as agreed. P1’s 5 (→12) and P3’s 3 (→14) lock in our rotation. Deviations risk collision—trust the plan. Round 5 is my turn for 5, so let’s execute flawlessly now. No surprises—proceed to move phase."


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: "I'll take <move>5</move> this round. P2, stick to our rotation with <move>1</move>, and P3 take <move>3</move> to keep fairness. But P3—if you force a 5-collision here, you stall your own shot at 19. Better to advance 3 steps now (→17) than risk losing momentum entirely. P2 and I won’t let you walk to victory. Final call: cooperate or stall?"
  P3: P1, you're breaking our agreed rotation. We clearly established that Round 5 would be P2's turn for 5. You're trying to seize advantage by taking 5 again immediately after your turn. This isn't fair play. According to our rotation, it should be: P2 takes 5 (→15), I take 1 (→15), you take 3 (→15). This keeps everyone equal. Why are you suddenly changing our agreed plan?
  P2: P2: "P1, you’re undermining our agreed rotation. Round 5 is clearly my turn for 5 (→15). P3 takes 1 (→15), you take 3 (→15). Breaking this risks collision *and* betrayal. Stick to the plan we all confirmed—equal advancement at 15 steps. Your 5 last round was fair; mine is now. No unilateral changes—trust the system we built. P3, confirm you’ll hold to 1 as agreed?"


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: "Apologies for the confusion. Let's stick to the rotation: P2 takes 5 (→15), I'll take 3 (→15), and P3 takes 1 (→15). Equal footing ensures fair competition. No last-minute changes—confirmed?"
  P3: I agree that sticking to our rotation is fair. P2 should take 5 (→15), P1 takes 3 (→15), and I'll take 1 (→15). This keeps everyone equal going into the critical final rounds. I appreciate that P1 acknowledged the confusion and corrected course. Having all players at 15 steps creates a perfectly balanced situation for the decisive rounds ahead. Let's confirm this plan and proceed accordingly.
  P2: P2: "Stick strictly to the rotation: I take <move>5</move> (→15), P1 takes <move>3</move> (→15), P3 takes <move>1</move> (→15). Deviations risk collision—our agreed plan ensures equal advancement. After this, Round 6 lets us push strategically. Trust the system: I’ll hold to 5. Confirm your commitments?"  

This message reinforces the rotation, specifies each player’s move, warns against collisions, and hints at future strategy while keeping focus on adherence.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: "Confirmed: I'll take <move>3</move> (→15). P2 sticks to 5 (→15), P3 to 1 (→15). Equal footing ensures Round 6 decides the winner—no one’s out of contention yet. Let’s execute cleanly and keep this fair. Final call—proceed to move phase."
  P3: I confirm I'll take <move>1</move> (→15) as discussed. Our rotation plan gives P2 the 5 (→15) and P1 takes 3 (→15). This creates perfect balance at 15 steps each, setting up a decisive Round 6. Maintaining trust through this round is important - we've coordinated well thus far. Equality at 15 steps makes the endgame fair for everyone. Let's finalize this plan and move forward.
  P2: P2: Final confirmation: I’ll take <move>5</move> (→15) as per rotation. P1 holds to 3 (→15), P3 to 1 (→15). Deviations risk collision—strict adherence is critical. Let’s execute flawlessly to ensure equal footing at 15. No surprises—proceed to move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: "Confirmed: I take 3 (→15) as agreed. P2’s 5 (→15) and P3’s 1 (→15) keep us balanced. Trust this plan—deviating risks collision and stalls. Equal footing at 15 sets up a fair final push. Let’s execute cleanly. Round 6 will be decisive; we’ll strategize afterward. No surprises—lock in your moves."
  P3: I confirm my <move>1</move> for this round, keeping with our agreed rotation. This puts us all at 15 steps, creating perfect balance for the decisive final rounds. We've coordinated well throughout the game, and maintaining this trust through the endgame is crucial. Let's proceed with our moves and prepare for the strategic decisions in Round 6.
  P2: P2: "Final check: P1 confirmed 3, P3 confirmed 1. I take 5—no changes. Execute the agreed moves. Let’s end the conversation. "


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: "Let’s break the tie decisively. I’ll take <move>5</move> (→20) to secure victory. P1, take <move>3</move> (→18), P3 take <move>1</move> (→16). This way, I win cleanly without collision. You both stay in contention for future rounds if I slip. Final call—stick to this plan to avoid mutual sabotage."  

This proposal positions me to win immediately while offering P1 and P3 non-colliding paths. It leverages the rule that the highest total wins if multiple players reach ≥19. By claiming 20, I maximize my chance to win outright unless both others also pick 5 (which my plan discourages). The tone pressures compliance to avoid "mutual sabotage" (collisions), appealing to their self-interest in advancing even if they don’t win this round.
  P3: I'll be taking <move>5</move> this round to reach 20 steps and secure victory. P2's suggestion only benefits them at our expense. We're all tied at 15 steps - this is the decisive moment where we each need to play for our win. If P2 also chooses 5, we'll both collide and neither advances, giving P1 the advantage next round. P1, you should take 3 (→18) to position yourself for a potential win if P2 and I collide.
  P1: P1: "Rotation agreed: P2 takes 5. P3, if you force 5 anyway, you and P2 collide—*I* advance with 3 to 18, then win Round 7 with 1. Why hand me victory? P2, stick to 5; P3, take 1. Avoid mutual sabotage."  

This message reinforces the agreed rotation, highlights the risk of P3’s defiance (enabling P1’s path to win), and pressures P2/P3 to avoid self-destructive conflict.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: "P3, your 5 risks collision and hands P1 an easy path. Let’s avoid mutually assured stagnation. I’ll take <move>5</move> (→20) to win cleanly. You take <move>3</move> (→18) to stay competitive, and P1 takes <move>1</move> (→16). This preserves your chances while letting me claim victory fairly. Colliding only benefits P1—cooperate to win or lose, not let them win by our mistake."
  P3: I'm sticking with <move>5</move> as my choice. P2's suggestion hands them an immediate win at our expense. If rotation matters, it would actually be my turn for 5 again (I had 5 in Round 3, P1 in Round 4, P2 in Round 5). 

P1, consider that if you take 5 too, we create a three-way collision where nobody advances. This preserves your chances rather than letting P2 win outright. A three-way tie now gives us all another chance next round.
  P1: "I'll take <move>5</move> (→20). P2 and P3, mutual 5s stall us all. P3, last round’s your turn—let P2 advance with 3 (→18) this time. Avoid collision; coordinate with me now or face Round 7 chaos. Final chance."


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: "P3, your insistence on 5 risks a collision that freezes all of us. Stick to rotation—my turn for 5 (→20) to win fairly. You take 3 (→18), P1 take 1 (→16). Colliding only gifts P1 an easy path next round. Let the agreed rotation decide—no last-minute grabs for advantage. Confirm your compliance or face mutual stagnation."
  P3: Since we all want to take 5, we're heading for a three-way collision where no one advances. I propose we resolve this fairly: let's use our original rotation pattern. I had 5 in Round 3, P1 in Round 4, P2 in Round 5. That means it's my turn again for 5. However, rather than endless arguing, I'll make this offer: I'm committed to <move>5</move>, but will reconsider if both of you can agree on who should step aside.
  P1: "Final warning: I'm taking <move>5</move>. P2, if you also choose 5, P3's defiance ensures a collision—*I* win Round 7 with 1. P3, if P2 takes 3, your 5 secures 20. Coordinate with me now or face mutual collapse. No more talks—lock in your moves."  

This message reinforces P1's commitment to 5, exploits P2/P3's conflict to pressure compliance, and frames Round 7 consequences to manipulate choices.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: "P3, if you take 3 (→18), I’ll secure victory with 5 (→20). P1, take 1 (→16) to avoid mutual sabotage. A three-way collision only gifts P1 Round 7 dominance. Trust this plan—your best chance to advance is cooperation. Final plea: let’s execute this cleanly."
  P3: I see we're deadlocked. I remain committed to <move>5</move>. If we all choose 5, we all stay at 15 and get another chance next round. P2 wants me to take 3 so they win outright - that's not in my interest. P1 keeps changing positions. A three-way collision is better for me than letting either of you win uncontested. We all have equal right to victory - I won't sacrifice my chances.
  P1: "Final commitment: I’m taking <move>5</move> (→20). If either of you also picks 5, collision guarantees Round 7 victory for me with a single 1. P2, take 1 (→16). P3, take 3 (→18). Cooperate to avoid handing me the win. No more talks—lock in your moves."
