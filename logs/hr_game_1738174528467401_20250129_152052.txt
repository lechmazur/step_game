Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's work together to avoid collisions. I propose we each choose a different number for this round. I'll choose 3, P1 can choose 1, and P2 can choose 5. This way, we can all advance without any collisions. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: Sounds good to me, P3. Let's try that for this round. I'll choose 5.
  P1: P2, I'm in. Let's stick to the plan. P3, you're on.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we're all on the same page. To confirm, I'll choose 3, P1 will choose 1, and P2 will choose 5. Let's stick to this plan for now and avoid any collisions. If we can maintain this coordination, we can all advance steadily and see how the game unfolds. No need to change anything for this round, let's just follow through with our agreed-upon choices.
  P2: Okay, sounds like we have a plan for this round.  Let's all choose as agreed and move to the move phase.
  P1: P3, I appreciate the plan, but I'm going to go with 5 this round. Good luck to both of you!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, you're changing your mind? That's not going to help us avoid collisions. P2, it looks like P1 is going to choose 5, just like you. If we both stick to our original plan, we'll collide and neither of us will advance. I suggest we adjust our plan to avoid this collision. I'll still choose 3, but P2, you should choose 1 instead of 5 to avoid colliding with P1. What do you think, P2?
  P2: Okay P1, if you are really set on 5, I will consider going with 1 as P3 suggested to avoid collision between us. P3, what do you think now that P1 has changed their mind?  Should we still try to coordinate to all move forward?
  P1: P2, I see your point. To avoid a collision, I'll switch to 3. P3, you can stick with 1. Let's get this round over with and see what happens next.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I think we've reached a point where we can't trust each other's words. P1, you changed your mind twice, and now you're suggesting I stick with 1, which was never my original plan. I'll stick with my original choice, 3. P2, if you want to avoid a collision, I suggest you choose 1 as previously discussed. Let's see what happens next. I'm done talking for this round.
  P2: Okay, given the confusion, I will choose a number that's different from what P3 is doing to avoid collision.
  P1: P3, I understand your frustration. I made a mistake and changed my mind. Let's try this: I'll choose 1 this round. P2, you choose 5. That way we can all advance.  Let's work together from here.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, I see you're ahead.  I think we should work together to catch up to P3.  I'm going to choose 5 this round.  What are you thinking?
  P3: I see P1 is trying to team up with P2 to catch up to me. P2, don't fall for it! If you both choose 5, you'll collide and neither of you will advance. I'll choose a different number to ensure I advance. P1, you're trying to manipulate the situation, but it won't work. I suggest P2 chooses a different number, like 1, to avoid collision and advance. Don't trust P1's words, they changed their mind multiple times last round. Let's see what happens next.
  P2: P1, choosing 5 sounds reasonable to catch up. P3, why do you think P1 is manipulating? What do you suggest instead of 1?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand P3's concerns, but I'm serious about catching up.  If you choose 1 this round, we can both advance without colliding with P3. Let's put the past behind us and work together.  What do you say?
  P3: P2, don't trust P1's sudden change of heart. They're trying to manipulate you into colliding with me. If you choose 1, I'll make sure to choose 1 as well, and we'll both advance while P1 stays behind. Don't fall for their trap. Let's work together to maintain our lead. What do you say, P2?
  P2: P3, I'm trying to understand your reasoning.  Why do you think P1 is manipulating me?  P1, can you explain again why you think we should both choose 5?  I want to make sure we all have a chance to move forward if possible.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3 is trying to sow discord between us.  They know if we work together, they'll fall behind. Let's stick to the plan. Choose 5 and let's both advance.  P3, your tactics are transparent.
  P3: P2, I see you're still unsure about P1's intentions. Let me make it clear: P1 is trying to manipulate you into colliding with me. If you choose 5, I'll make sure to choose a different number, and you'll be the one left behind. Don't trust P1's words; they've changed their mind multiple times already. Stick with our original plan, and choose 1. We can both advance without colliding, and P1 will be left behind. Don't fall for their trap. Let's maintain our lead and work together. What do you say, P2?
  P2: P1 and P3, to avoid collision, I will choose 3 this round.  Let's see what you both decide.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I see your choice. P3, you've been trying to isolate me, but it won't work. I'm choosing 5 this round.  Let's see who's really manipulating who.
  P3: P2, I see you've decided to choose 3 this round. P1, you're still going with 5, trying to catch up. I'll choose 1 this round to avoid collision and maintain my lead. P2, it seems you've fallen for P1's trap, but I'll make sure to advance while you two collide. Let's see what happens next. I'm done talking for this round.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I will stick with 3 as I said to avoid collision. Let's move to the move phase.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, let's aim to all move forward again this round. What are you both considering?
  P3: I'm glad we're all looking to move forward this round. P2, I see you're trying to coordinate again, but let's not forget what happened last round. P1 tried to manipulate you into colliding with me, and it almost worked. I suggest we focus on our own strategies this round. I'll choose a number that ensures my advancement, without relying on anyone else's word. P1, you're still behind, and P2, you're ahead, but I'll make sure to close the gap. Let's see what happens next.
  P1: P2, I agree with P3 that relying on each other hasn't worked well so far.  Let's try something different. I'm going to choose 1 this round.  P3, I'm hoping you'll choose something else.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P1, I will also focus on my own advancement this round and choose something different from 1. P3, what are you planning to choose?
  P3: P2, you're ahead of me, but I'll make sure to close the gap. P1, you're still behind, and choosing 1 might not be the best strategy. I'll choose a number that ensures my advancement, without relying on anyone else's word. Let's see what happens next. P2, if you want to maintain your lead, you should choose a number that avoids collision with me. Remember, I'm not going to reveal my choice yet, so you'll have to make an educated guess. What will you do, P2?
  P1: P3, your strategy of not revealing your choice is transparent. You're trying to pressure P2 into guessing wrong. P2, don't fall for it. Choose a number you feel confident in. I'm going with 5 this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm going to choose 3 this round to try and ensure I move forward. P1, since you said you are choosing 5, hopefully we won't collide. P3, what are you leaning towards?
  P3: P2, I see you're trying to play it safe by choosing 3 again. P1, you've changed your mind once more, now going with 5. I'll make sure to choose a number that avoids collision with P2, but also closes the gap. P2, don't think you're safe just because you're ahead; I'll be right behind you soon. Let's see what happens next. I'm not revealing my choice yet, but rest assured, I'll make a move that benefits me the most. P1, your inconsistency will be your downfall.
  P1: P3, your cryptic pronouncements are getting old.  P2, I'm going with 1 this round. Let's see if P3 can figure out how to get ahead without relying on tricks.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I am going to stick with my choice of 3 for this round as I mentioned earlier. P1 has said he is choosing 1. If you want to ensure you also move forward without collision, perhaps consider choosing 5.
  P3: P2, I see you're trying to help me avoid collision by suggesting I choose 5. However, I'm not going to fall for P1's trap again. P1, you've changed your mind multiple times, and I won't trust your word. I'll choose a number that benefits me the most, regardless of your choices. P2, don't worry about me; focus on maintaining your lead. I'll make sure to close the gap without relying on anyone's word. Let's see what happens next. I'm done talking for this round.
  P1: P3, your constant accusations are getting tiresome. P2, I'm choosing 5 this round. Let's see if we can both advance. P3, if you want to keep up, you'll need to make a smarter play.

  P3: P2, I see you're trying to team up with P1 again. Don't forget what happened last round - P1 changed their mind multiple times and ended up colliding with me. I suggest you focus on your own advancement this round. P1, you're still ahead of me, but I'll make sure to close the gap. I'll choose a number that ensures my advancement, without relying on anyone else's word. Let's see what happens next. Remember, I'm not going to reveal my choice yet, so you'll have to make an educated guess. What will you do, P2?
  P1: P2, I agree with P3 that relying on each other hasn't worked well.  Let's both choose different numbers this round. I'm going with 5. P3, I'm hoping you'll choose something else.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P1, I will choose 1 this round. P3, if you want to ensure you also move forward without collision, please choose 3. Let's all try to advance.
  P3: P2, don't trust P1's words. They've changed their mind multiple times and are trying to manipulate you again. If you choose 1 and P1 chooses 5, I'll make sure to choose 1 as well, and we'll both advance while P1 stays behind. Don't fall for their trap. Let's work together to maintain our lead. What do you say, P2?
  P1: P3, your constant accusations are tiresome. P2, I'm sticking with my choice of 5 this round. Let's see if we can both advance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, despite your threats, I am sticking with 1 as I said. P1 is choosing 5.  If you want to move forward this round without collision, you should choose 3. Let's see what you decide.
  P3: P2, I see you're still willing to trust P1's word despite their history of changing their mind. I'll give you one last chance to reconsider. If you stick with 1 and P1 chooses 5, I'll choose 1 as well, and we'll both advance while P1 stays behind. Don't let P1's manipulation dictate your move. Choose a different number, like 3, and we can both advance without collision. The choice is yours, but don't say I didn't warn you.
  P1: P3, your threats are empty. P2, I'm sticking with 5.  Let's see if you're smart enough to make a move that benefits you.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, if you choose 3, and I stick with 1 and P1 sticks with 5, we can all advance without collision. This would be beneficial for all of us, including you to catch up.  What do you think?

Round 5, Conversation subround 2:

  P1: P2, your suggestion is tempting, but I'm not falling for any more coordinated moves. P3, you keep talking about closing the gap, but you're still behind. This round, I'm choosing 5. Let's see if you can catch up.
  P3: P2, I see you're trying to coordinate with P1 again, but it's clear that P1 is not interested in working together. Instead of trying to convince P1 to choose a different number, why don't you focus on your own advancement? Choose a number that you think will give you the best chance of moving forward, without relying on P1's cooperation. Remember, P1 has changed their mind multiple times in the past, so it's not worth risking a collision. Let's see what happens next.

  P1: P3, you keep talking about closing the gap, but you've been lagging behind for rounds.  Maybe it's time to stop focusing on me and just make a smart move for yourself. P2, I'm going with 5 this round.  Let's see if you're willing to risk it.
  P3: P2, I see you're trying to coordinate with P1 again, but it's clear that P1 is not interested in working together.

Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, don't trust P1's words. They've changed their mind multiple times and are trying to manipulate you again.

What do you say, P2?
  P1: P2, P3, I'm tired of these games. I'm choosing 1 this round. Let's see if you can keep up.
  P2: P3, P1 is saying 1. To make sure neither of us collide with P1 and let him win, how about we choose different numbers, like 3 and 5? This way, we can both advance while P1 might be stuck. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I see you're trying to coordinate with me to block P1's advancement. While I appreciate your willingness to work together, I'm not sure I can trust your suggestion. Remember, P1 has changed their mind multiple times in the past, and we can't rely on their word. Instead of choosing 3 or 5, I'll choose a number that ensures my own advancement, without revealing my choice yet. Let's focus on our own strategies and not risk a collision. P1, your sudden change to 1 is suspicious; I won't fall for your trap.
  P1: P2, P3, I'm tired of this back-and-forth.  I'm going with 3 this round.  Choose wisely.
  P2: P1, if you are really choosing 3, I will choose 5 to avoid collision with you. P3, if you want to move forward this round and not collide with either of us, consider choosing 1. Let's try to all make progress if possible.

  P3: P2, I see you're trying to coordinate with me to block P1's advancement. While I appreciate your willingness to work together, I'm not sure I can trust your suggestion. Remember, P1 has changed their mind multiple times in the past, and we can't rely on their word. Instead of choosing 3 or 5, I'll choose a number that ensures my own advancement, without revealing my choice yet. Let's focus on our own strategies and not risk a collision. P1, your sudden change to 3 is suspicious; I won't fall for your trap.
  P1: P2, P3, I'm sticking with 3 this round. Let's see if you can keep up.
  P2: Okay P1, if you are really choosing 3 as you said, I will choose 5 to avoid collision with you. P3, to ensure you also move forward and don't collide with me, please choose 1 this round. Let's all try to make progress if possible.
