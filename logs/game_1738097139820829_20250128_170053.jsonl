If we want to keep the game competitive, we need to coordinate effectively. I propose I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we can all advance while keeping the competition alive. If P2 is determined to push for 5, we need to ensure we still make progress without letting anyone run away with the game. Let\u2019s maximize our steps this round! What do you both think?"}
