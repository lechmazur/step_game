Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Let's make this interesting! I suggest everyone picks 5 this turn to really push forward. Good luck!"
  P1: I appreciate the aggressive strategy, but choosing 5 might backfire if more than one of us does it. I'm considering a more cautious move this turn to avoid collisions and gain a small lead. What do you both think?
  P2: I see both of your points. P3, your strategy is bold, but P1 has a valid concern about collisions. How about we try to coordinate our moves to avoid clashes? Maybe we can agree on different numbers for this turn to ensure everyone makes progress. I'm open to suggestions. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed, P2. To ensure we all advance without collisions, I'll choose 5, P1 can go with 1, and you take 3. This way, each of us makes progress safely this turn. Let me know if you're on board!
  P1: I’m not comfortable giving someone an early lead with uneven numbers. How about we all choose 3 this turn so no one gets an uncontested boost? I’m in for 3 if you both are.
  P2: Alright, I see P1's point about avoiding an early lead. How about a compromise? P1 and P3, you both choose 3, and I'll choose 1. This way, we all move forward, but no one gets too far ahead. It keeps the game balanced while ensuring progress. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "To ensure we all make progress without collisions, I'll choose 5 this turn. P1, you can select 1, and P2, please pick 3. This way, each of us advances safely. Let's proceed with this plan."
  P1: I appreciate all your suggestions. I notice there's still some mix between bold and cautious moves. I’m leaning toward a balanced strategy that avoids any collision risk. Let’s be clear: if we don’t align on the same number, I’ll adjust accordingly. What final move do you both plan on committing to?
  P2: Alright, let's simplify this. P1 and P3, how about we all choose 1 this turn? It's the safest bet to ensure we all move forward without any collisions. This way, no one gets left behind, and we can reassess our strategies in the next round. What do you think? Let's agree on this and move on.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "I’m aiming for a strong move this turn by choosing 5 steps. If P1 and P2 can select different numbers, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions and make steady progress!"
  P1: I’m going with a safe 3 this turn. P3, since you're leaning strong with 5, and P2, if you pick 1, we'll avoid any collisions and everyone advances. That way, I'll keep my current lead while you both build yours. Thoughts?
  P2: Let's be strategic here. P3, if you're set on choosing 5, and P1 is going with 3, I'll stick with 1 to ensure we all move forward without collisions. This keeps the game balanced and prevents anyone from falling behind. Let's confirm our choices: P3 with 5, P1 with 3, and I'll take 1. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed, P2. I’ll choose 5, P1 will take 3, and you select 1. This plan ensures we all advance without collisions. Let’s proceed and make steady progress together!
  P1: I’m sticking with our agreed plan as long as everyone stays committed. I value avoiding collisions, and if we all keep to our numbers, we can safely advance. If any unexpected change happens last minute, I’ll adapt my move accordingly. Let’s confirm our commitment now so we can keep the game steady and avoid unnecessary risks.
  P2: I'm still on board with our agreed plan: P3 chooses 5, P1 chooses 3, and I'll choose 1. This way, we all move forward without any collisions. Let's confirm one last time and proceed to the move phase. If everyone is committed, respond with  to end the conversation phase. Let's play fair and advance together.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, let's reassess our strategies for this round. P1, you have a slight lead, and P3, you're close behind. To keep things balanced and avoid collisions, how about this: P1, you choose 1 this turn to play it safe. P3, you can choose 3 to close the gap a bit. I'll choose 5 to catch up. This way, we all move forward without any collisions. Let's agree on this plan and proceed. What do you both think?
  P3: Agreed, I'll choose 3. P1 takes 1 and you choose 5. Let's proceed and move forward safely. Good luck!
  P1: I'm concerned that picking 1 will slow my progress. I’ll stick with 3 to keep my lead. If we don’t coordinate properly and someone switches, I'll adjust my move accordingly. I urge everyone to avoid collisions so we each advance safely.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Alright, let's adjust the plan slightly to accommodate P1's concerns. P1, if you're set on choosing 3, then P3, you can choose 1 to avoid a collision. I'll stick with 5 to catch up. This way, we all move forward without any issues. Let's confirm this plan: P1 chooses 3, P3 chooses 1, and I'll choose 5. Agreed?
  P3: To optimize our progress, let's have P1 choose 3, P2 choose 1, and I'll choose 5. This way, we all advance without any collisions. Let me know if you agree.
  P1: I'm committed to 3. I trust P3 will choose 1 and P2 will pick 5 so we can all avoid collisions and progress safely. Let's stick to these moves.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: Alright, let's finalize our plan. P1, you're sticking with 3, and P3, you've agreed to choose 1. I'll confirm my choice of 5. This ensures we all move forward without collisions. Let's lock in our moves and proceed to the move phase. Everyone, please confirm your final choice.
  P3: "I’d like to choose 5 this turn to maximize my progress. If P1 selects 3 and P2 chooses 1, we can all advance without collisions. Let’s proceed with P1: 3, P2: 1, and P3: 5. Agreed?"
  P1: I'm sticking with 3. Let's finalize our commitments to avoid collisions—P2 and P3, please confirm your moves so we can all progress safely.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, with my 9‐step lead, I’m keen to play safely. I suggest we all go with 3 this round to avoid collisions. This keeps things balanced and lets me protect my lead. If you have plans to adjust for a catch-up move, now’s the time to speak up so we can coordinate. Let me know your commitments.
  P2: P1, I understand your strategy to maintain your lead, but choosing 3 might not be the best move for P3 and me to catch up. How about this: P1, you choose 1 to play it safe. P3, you choose 3 to make steady progress. I'll choose 5 to close the gap. This way, we all move forward without collisions. Let's agree on this plan. What do you both think?
  P3: I agree with P2's proposal. Let's proceed with P1 choosing 1, P3 selecting 3, and P2 picking 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Looking forward to a fair move this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I remain committed to choosing 3. My lead gives me confidence in a slightly riskier move. I appreciate your proposals, but I'll stick with 3 this turn. Please confirm your moves so we avoid collisions and all progress safely.
  P2: Alright, let's adjust our strategy given P1's commitment to choosing 3. To avoid collisions and ensure we all move forward, how about this: P1 sticks with 3, P3 chooses 1, and I'll choose 5. This way, we all advance safely. P3, are you okay with choosing 1 this turn? Let's confirm our moves and proceed.
  P3: P3: I agree to choose 1 this turn. So, P1 selects 3, I choose 1, and P2 picks 5. This avoids any collisions and allows us all to advance safely.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I remain committed to 3 for my move. With my lead, I'll take that risk. P2 and P3, please confirm your plans so we can avoid any last-minute collisions. Let’s finalize our moves and move on.
  P2: P2: Alright, let's finalize our moves. P1, you're sticking with 3. P3, you've agreed to choose 1. I'll confirm my choice of 5. This ensures we all move forward without collisions. Let's lock in our moves and proceed to the move phase. Everyone, please confirm your final choice.
  P3: I choose 5 this turn to maximize my progress. Let’s proceed with P1: 3, P2: 5, and P3: 5. Good luck!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, let's reassess our strategies for this round. P1, you have a significant lead, and P3, you're catching up. To keep things balanced and avoid collisions, how about this: P1, you choose 1 this turn to play it safe. P3, you can choose 3 to close the gap a bit. I'll choose 5 to catch up. This way, we all move forward without any collisions. Let's agree on this plan and proceed. What do you both think?
  P1: I'm sticking with 3 this round. My progress so far shows a solid lead, and I believe consistency is key. I'll adjust if the situation calls for it, but I'm committed to 3.
  P3: "P1 has chosen 3. I'll go with 5 to close the gap and take the lead. P2, please pick 1 so we all advance smoothly without any collisions. Let’s make this round count!"


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you're set on choosing 5, I'll adjust and choose 3 instead of 1. This way, P1 can still choose 3, and we avoid collisions. P1 has a significant lead, so it's crucial for us to catch up. Let's confirm our moves: P1 chooses 3, P3 chooses 5, and I'll choose 3. Agreed?
  P1: I remain committed to 3. The proposals are conflicting—if P2 switches to 3 while P3 is set on 5, P2 and I would collide. I still favor our earlier plan: I pick 3, P3 takes 5, and P2 goes with 1. Let’s confirm this setup now so we can all progress without setbacks.
  P3: I confirm my choice of 5. Let's proceed with P1: 3, P2: 1, and P3: 5 to avoid any collisions. Good luck to everyone!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, let's confirm our moves one last time to ensure we all advance safely. P1 is sticking with 3, you're choosing 5, and I'll go with 1. This way, we avoid any collisions and make progress. Let's lock in our choices and proceed to the move phase. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: I remain set on 3. For clarity and collision avoidance, I'm counting on P2 to pick 1 and P3 to stick with 5 as we agreed earlier. Let's lock this in and move forward safely.
  P3: I’m choosing 5 this round to advance aggressively. I hope P1 picks 3 and P2 picks 1 so we all move forward without collisions. Let’s proceed!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, let's focus on catching up this round. P1, you have a strong lead, so sticking with 3 makes sense for you. P3, you're making good progress. To avoid collisions and ensure we all move forward, how about this: P1, you choose 3, P3, you choose 1, and I'll choose 5. This way, we can all advance without any issues. Let's confirm this plan and proceed. What do you both think?
  P1: I remain committed to 3. I support the idea of avoiding collisions and advancing safely, so I’ll lock in on 3. I trust P3 will opt for 1 and P2 for 5 as suggested so we all move forward.
  P3: Agreed, I'll choose 1 this round to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let’s keep progressing safely. Good luck to everyone!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: Thanks for the confirmation, P1 and P3. Let's lock in our moves to ensure we all advance safely. P1, you're sticking with 3, and P3, you've agreed to choose 1. I'll confirm my choice of 5. This ensures we all move forward without collisions. Let's finalize our choices and proceed to the move phase. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: I'm still set on 3. Let's please lock in our commitments to avoid any last-minute changes—P3 with 1 and P2 with 5, as agreed—so we all progress smoothly this turn.
  P3: I confirm my choice of 1 this round. Let's proceed with P1: 3, P2: 5, and P3: 1 to ensure we all advance safely without collisions. Good luck!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Alright, let's confirm our moves one last time to ensure we all advance safely. P1, you're sticking with 3, and P3, you've agreed to choose 1. I'll confirm my choice of 5. This ensures we all move forward without collisions. Let's finalize our choices and proceed to the move phase. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: I'll stick with 3 as planned. Since I'm at 15 steps, I need a clear round without collisions. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves—P2 with 5 and P3 with 1—to ensure we all move safely. Let's lock it in now.
  P3: "I appreciate the coordination effort, but to stay competitive, I'll choose 5 this turn. Let's push forward and see who reaches the goal first. Good luck to everyone!"

  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 =>

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm sticking with my game plan to finish strong. With 18 steps, I’m leaning into a decisive move. P2 and P3, please choose your moves carefully—if we collide on the same pick, progress stalls for everyone. I suggest avoiding the same number as me. Let's lock our choices and finish this round decisively.
  P3: I'm going for 5 steps this round to reach 20. P1, if you choose 1, I can win. Let’s make this a decisive round. Good luck!
  P2: P3, your bold move to reach 20 steps is clear. P1, you're just 2 steps away from winning. To maximize my progress and avoid collisions, I'll choose 3 this turn. This keeps me moving forward without risking a collision with either of you. Let's confirm our moves: P1, you can choose 1 or 3, and P3, you're set on 5. Good luck to both of you!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, please reconsider your pick. If you stick with 3 while I choose 3 and P3 goes 5, you'll cause a collision that lets P3 win. For a fair contest—and to keep our options open—I need you to switch to 1. I'm committed to 3 for a decisive win, so please adjust your move accordingly. Let's lock this in now.
  P3: "P2, to ensure a fair finish, I'll stick with picking 5 to reach 20. If you choose 1, P1 will end at 19, and I can secure the win without any collisions. Let's finalize our moves: P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 1, and I choose 5. This way, we all progress smoothly. Looking forward to a decisive round. Good luck!"
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy to win, but I need to maximize my steps too. I'll stick with 3 to avoid finishing last. P1, you're close to winning, but choosing 3 might not be enough if P3 reaches 20. I suggest you pick 5 to secure your win. Let's confirm: P1 chooses 5, P3 chooses 5, and I'll choose 3. Good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm sticking with 3 for a decisive finish. I urge P2 to choose 1—avoiding a collision that could hand P3 the win. With 18 steps, a safe boost to 21 wins the game. P3, please hold with 5 as we agreed earlier. Let's lock in P1:3, P2:1, and P3:5 for a clean round.
  P3: "I’m choosing 5 this round to reach 20 steps and aim for the win. P2, please pick 1 to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let’s make this decisive move count. Good luck to everyone!"
  P2: P2: Alright, let's reassess quickly. P1, you're committed to 3, and P3 is set on 5. To avoid collisions and maximize my steps, I'll switch to 1. This ensures P1 reaches 21, P3 reaches 20, and I move to 4 steps. Let's confirm: P1 chooses 3, P3 chooses 5, and I'll choose 1. Good luck to both of you!
