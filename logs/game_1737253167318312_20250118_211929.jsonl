We need to be strategic this round. I propose we go with the following moves: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. This way, we can all advance without colliding and keep the game competitive. If we stick to this plan, we can maximize our chances of moving forward. Let\u2019s finalize our choices quickly so we can see how this round plays out! Are we ready to lock in these moves?"}
