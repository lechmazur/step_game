Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to avoid collisions early on. If we coordinate, we can all move forward instead of blocking each other. What do you both think?
  P1: P1: I agree, coordination is key. Let's each pick a different number this turn to ensure we all advance. I’ll go with 1 to start, so others can choose 3 or 5. Let’s confirm plans here first.
  P2: Okay, I'll take 5 this round. P1 is taking 1, so P3, if you take 3, we should all advance.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good to me. I'll take 3 this round so we all move forward without collisions. Let's stick to the plan and ensure we all advance.
  P1: Alright, let's confirm the plan to ensure clarity. I’ll stick with 1, P2 is on 5, and P3 on 3. This way, we all advance safely. No surprises here.
  P2: Okay, great. Just confirming I'm still taking 5. Let's make sure we all stick to the plan for this round to get a good start.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, I need to make sure my message is concise and follows the rules. Let me check the positions again. P1 is at 1, P2 at 5, P3 at 3. To avoid collisions, we need each to pick different numbers. I want to maximize my own progress while keeping others on track. 

If I suggest taking 5, then P2 and P3 can take 3 and 1 respectively. That way, my position jumps to 6, which is better. Let me make sure there are no overlaps:

- P1: 1 + 5 = 6  
- P2: 5 + 3 = 8  
- P3: 3 + 1 = 4  

All unique. Perfect. I'll propose this rotation to keep advancing without collisions.

**Message:**  
Let's rotate our moves to advance safely. I'll take 5 this round. P2, how about 3? P3 can take 1 to avoid overlaps. Confirm?
  P2: Okay, I'm happy to take 3 this round. P3, are you happy to take 1? That leaves P1 to take 5. Just confirming to avoid any mistakes.
  P3: Alright, I see the plan. If we stick to this, we all move forward safely again. I’ll take 1 this round as suggested. P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. Let’s confirm we’re all in agreement.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Confirmed. Let’s proceed with the rotation: I take **5**, P2 takes **3**, and P3 takes **1**. No changes needed.
  P2: Okay, great, we're all on the same page. Just confirming again that I will take 3 this round. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1.
  P3: Alright, everything looks good to me. If we all stick to the plan, we’ll avoid collisions and keep moving forward efficiently. I’ll take 1 this round as agreed. Let’s not change anything last minute. Confirming one last time: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirmed the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. No changes. Let’s execute this to advance safely.
  P2: Okay, we've confirmed the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's stick to it to ensure we all advance. No changes from my side.
  P3: Alright, we've all confirmed the plan multiple times: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. As long as no one changes their move last minute, we all advance safely. Let’s stick to it and build trust for future rounds. No surprises, agreed?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s continue coordinating to avoid collisions. I’ll take 3 this round (6+3=9). P2, if you take 5 (8+5=13), and P3 takes 1 (4+1=5), we all advance safely. This keeps us moving forward without overlaps. Confirm?
  P3: That plan works for me. If I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5, we all move forward without collisions. P2, do you agree to take 5 this round? If we stick to this, we maintain steady progress. Let’s confirm.
  P2: Yes, I agree with the plan. I will take 5 this round. P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's stick to it.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let’s stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This ensures no collisions and keeps us all advancing. Trust is crucial—let’s avoid last-minute changes to maintain progress. Confirming final positions: P1 to 9, P2 to 13, P3 to 5. Execute as planned.
  P3: Looks good to me. If we all stick to the plan—P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1—we avoid collisions and keep advancing efficiently. Trust is key here, so let’s not change anything last minute. P2, P1, just confirming one last time: are we all locked in?
  P2: Okay, great. I'm taking 5 as planned. Just confirming to P1 and P3 that we're all sticking to the agreement: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's execute!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: All confirmed, proceeding with the plan. Let’s finalize this to move forward.
  P3: All confirmed on my end. If we all stick to the plan—P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1—we continue advancing without collisions. We’ve built trust so far, so let’s not break it now. No last-minute changes. Let’s execute as agreed.
  P2: Okay, everyone seems committed to the plan: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's execute this round. I'm sticking with 5. No changes from my side.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s rotate moves again to avoid collisions. I’ll take 5 (9+5=14). P2, take 3 (13+3=16). P3, take 1 (5+1=6). This keeps us advancing safely. Confirm?
  P3: That plan works for me. If I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3, we all move forward without collisions again. P2, do you agree to take 3 this round? If we stick to this, we maintain steady progress. Let’s confirm and execute.
  P2: Yes, I agree to take 3 this round. P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's stick to it.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let’s finalize the plan: P1 takes **5** (14), P2 takes **3** (16), P3 takes **1** (6). Trust is critical—stick to these to avoid collisions. No last-minute changes.
  P3: P2, just confirming one last time—are you fully committed to taking 3 this round? If we all stick to the plan, we keep moving forward without issue. P1 takes 5, you take 3, and I take 1. Let’s lock this in and execute without surprises.
  P2: Okay, great. I'm taking 3 as planned. Just confirming to P1 and P3 that we're all sticking to the agreement: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's execute!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let’s finalize this plan to maintain progress: **P1 takes 5** (14), **P2 takes 3** (16), **P3 takes 1** (6). Trust is non-negotiable—any deviation risks collisions and wastes turns. P2’s lead is fragile; P3, don’t hesitate. Stick to 1. P2, confirm you’re locked on 3. Let’s execute *exactly* as agreed. No surprises.
  P3: P2, just confirming again—are you fully committed to taking 3 this round? If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and keep advancing. P1 takes 5, you take 3, and I take 1. Let’s lock this in and execute as planned. No surprises, agreed?
  P2: Okay, everyone seems committed to the plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's execute this round. I'm sticking with 3. No changes from my side.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s adjust to keep us all safe. I’ll take **3** (14→17), P2, take **1** (16→17), and P3, take **5** (6→11). This prevents P2 from winning early while we advance. Confirm?
  P2: Okay, I'm not taking 1. That would cause a collision with P1. P1 is close to winning, and P3 is far behind. I propose we both target P1. P3, if you take 5, and I take 5, P1 will not advance. Then P1 will be at 14, P2 will be at 21, and P3 will be at 11. Do you agree, P3?
  P3: P2, I see your point, but if you reach 21 first, you win outright. That doesn’t help me. I need a plan that keeps me in the game. If I take 5 and you take 5, you win immediately. Why would I help you win? I need a way to catch up. P1, what do you propose to ensure neither of us just hands P2 the victory?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **Message:**  
P2, your plan lets you win alone—P3 gains nothing. Let’s stay coordinated: I’ll take **5** (19), P2 takes **3** (19), P3 takes **1** (7). This keeps us all advancing without letting anyone win prematurely. P3, you gain ground while blocking P2’s path. Confirm?
  P2: P1, I'm not convinced by your proposal. We'd still be close to a tie. P3, how about this: I take 5 (21), you take 3 (9), and P1 takes 1 (15). I win *this* round, but I promise to help you win the next round by coordinating against P1. If we don't take P1 out now, they will win.
  P3: P2, your plan guarantees your victory while leaving me with no chance. That’s not in my best interest. If I take 5, you win immediately, and I lose. I need a plan where I can still compete. P1’s proposal at least keeps the game open. P1, what can you offer me to ensure I don’t fall too far behind while also preventing P2 from winning outright? I need a way to stay relevant in this game.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, P2’s plan guarantees your loss. My proposal ensures your progress: you move to 7, I to 19, P2 to 19. No one wins yet—keeping the game open for all. Colluding with P2 dooms you; stick with coordinated moves. P2, your “promise” is empty—why would P3 trust you after this round? Let’s advance safely. Confirm: **P1 takes 5**, **P2 takes 3**, **P3 takes 1**. No surprises.
  P2: Okay, P3, P1's plan is the only one that makes sense for you. If you help me win, you lose. If you help P1, you at least stay in the game. P1 is offering you a chance to catch up. Let's stick with P1's plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. This round.
  P3: P1’s plan keeps me in the game, while P2’s plan guarantees my loss. P2, why would I help you win instantly? If I follow P1’s proposal, I still have a chance to compete. P1, I’ll agree to your plan—**P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1**—but I need assurance that I won’t be left behind in future rounds. If I help block P2 now, I expect fair coordination moving forward. P1, can you commit to ensuring I get a chance to catch up in the next rounds? Let’s confirm and execute.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, you are both at 19 steps—one move away from potentially winning. I’m at 7, so I need a way to stay relevant. If you both collide, neither of you advances, which keeps the game open.  

P1, if I help you block P2, I need assurance that I won’t just be left behind next round. P2, if I help you, I need a real reason why that benefits me.  

I won’t make a move that guarantees my loss. What offers do you have that keep me in the game?
  P1: P2, to avoid collision, let’s finalize this: I’ll take **5** (24). Please take **3** (22) so I can win fairly. P3, take **1** to keep progressing. Let’s end this without ties.
  P2: P1, your plan benefits only you. P3 is too far behind to matter. Let's be realistic. P3, P1 will win if you follow that plan.

Here's a better offer: I take 5 (24), P1 takes 1 (20), and P3 takes 5 (12). I win *now*, but next round, I will help P3 win by ensuring P1 doesn't advance. P1 is the real threat. Trust me for one round, P3. Otherwise, P1 wins.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your plan wins you the game immediately, leaving me with nothing. P2, your plan also wins you the game, and your promise to help me later is meaningless once you’ve already won. I won’t make a move that guarantees my loss.  

The only move that keeps me in the game is forcing a collision between you two. If you both pick 5, you block each other, and I can move forward. So unless one of you offers me a real deal where I still have a chance, I will pick 5 to ensure neither of you wins this round.
  P1: P3, if you let me win now, I’ll ensure your path forward next round. P2, take 1 (20). I’ll take 3 (22). You, P3, take 5 to reach 12. This keeps you competitive against P2 while I secure victory. No one benefits from a collision—P2 can’t win alone yet. Confirm this deal?
  P2: P1 and P3, both plans offered guarantee my loss. I'm not going to do that. I will pick 5. If P1 also picks 5, I'll propose an alternative next round. If P1 picks something else, I win.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, since you're both at 19, I have no reason to let either of you win outright. My best move is ensuring a collision between you two while I advance. Unless one of you offers a real deal where I still have a chance, I will pick 5 to block you both. If you want my cooperation, I need a guarantee that I won’t just be left behind next round. Otherwise, I force a stalemate this turn. What’s your best offer to keep me in the game?
  P1: P3, your threats won’t help you win. Let’s finalize: I take **5** (24), P2 takes **3** (22), you take **1** (8). This lets me win cleanly while you gain ground. P2, if you refuse, I’ll pick 1—forcing you to collide with your own 5. Choose wisely: cooperate, or let me block you both. P3, this is your best path forward. Confirm now.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 5. P1, if you want to win, you need to pick 1. P3, if you want to have any chance, you need to pick 1 as well. That way, P1 and P3 will be at 20 and 8 respectively, and I will be at 24 and win the game.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 7 steps


*** Round 6 => winners = P1 ***
