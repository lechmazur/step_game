Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright folks, Round 1. Colliding helps no one right now. Maybe we should aim for different numbers? What do you think?
  P1: I'm with P2—avoiding collisions makes sense. Let’s each aim for a unique move this round: one picks 1, one 3, and one 5. I'm weighing my options carefully for maximum progress, so I’d prefer we coordinate so no one blocks another unintentionally. What do you both think?
  P3: Agreed. Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions. I’ll take 5, P1 can take 1, and P2 can take 3. That way we all advance without overlap. Does everyone agree?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P3, that avoids collision. P3=5, P1=1, P2=3. Ensures we all move. P1, are you comfortable taking 1 for this round?
  P1: I'm not comfortable with taking the minimal move—early aggression is key. I need every advantage to secure victory, so I’m leaning toward a higher option. To avoid collisions, perhaps P3 could consider a lower move this round while P2 stays with the middle one. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, if you take 3 instead of 1, P2 can take 1, and I'll stay at 5. This avoids collision while letting you advance more. P2, does this work for you?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 didn't want 1, and frankly, neither do I. Starting last isn't a great strategy. However, ensuring everyone moves in the first round has some value.

Okay, I'll agree to take 1 *this round* under the proposed P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 structure, just to avoid a collision. But let's be clear, I expect a fairer distribution in the next rounds. P3, you get 5 now, P1 gets 3, I get 1. We'll need to rotate who gets the lower numbers.
  P1: I'm fine with avoiding collisions this round. I'll commit to a clear, non-colliding move and keep my exact choice flexible for when the timing is right. Let's ensure round one goes smoothly and then adjust strategy as opportunities emerge. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: P2, P1, I confirm my commitment to 5 this round. P1 taking 3 and P2 1 ensures we all advance without collision. Let’s stick to this plan to secure progress. Any objections before we finalize?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, Round 1 went smoothly as planned. As agreed, since I took 1 last round, it's only fair I get a higher number this time to catch up.

I propose the following for Round 2 to ensure no collisions and rotate fairly: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1.

This allows everyone to advance again. P1, P3, what do you think?
  P1: I appreciate the thought, but early aggression is key for me. I’d prefer to go with distinct moves that maximize our progress—my idea is to take the highest move, leaving the moderate for P2 and the lowest for P3. This avoids collisions while ensuring clear advancement. Thoughts?
  P3: P3: I agree with P2’s rotation plan for fairness. Let’s proceed with P2=5, P1=3, and P3=1 this round. This ensures everyone advances without collision and rotates the highest move. Fairness now keeps the game balanced for future rounds. Any objections?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3 has already agreed to my proposal (P2=5, P1=3, P3=1). This brings everyone to 6 steps, which is fair since I took 1 last round. Your plan puts you further ahead and leaves me further behind. Let's stick to the fair rotation that P3 and I support. It keeps the game balanced for everyone.
  P1: I still believe aggressive progress beats even rotations. While fairness is appealing, winning demands taking the boldest safe step when the moment’s right. I’m leaning toward a move that maximizes my advance this round, and I encourage you both to reconsider if our current scheme truly best secures our win. Let’s avoid collisions but not at the cost of lost opportunity.
  P3: P3: Let’s prioritize progress over ego. If P1 insists on taking 5 again, P2 might also choose 5 to avoid falling too far behind, causing a collision and stalling both. This round’s rotation keeps us all advancing: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. Fairness ensures sustainability—winning requires consistent steps, not short-term gains. I’ll stick to 1 this round. P1, would you rather risk stagnation or commit to the plan?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3 has confirmed they will play 1. The plan P2=5, P1=3, P3=1 guarantees we all advance and reach 6 steps, keeping things even. If you choose 5, you risk colliding with me (I need 5 to catch up), meaning we both get 0 while P3 advances alone. Playing 3 guarantees you 3 steps. Let's secure progress for everyone this round. Are you sticking with 3?
  P1: I notice our discussion isn’t settling. With each step crucial on our race to 21, I’m weighing the benefits of sticking to our collision‐free plan versus seizing a bolder opportunity when the time is right. If either of you is open to slightly shifting our agreed moves to open a safe window for an extra push, let me know. Otherwise, I’ll pursue a move that balances aggression with the need to avoid collisions. Any final thoughts before we lock in?
  P3: P1, choosing 5 risks collision with P2. Let’s stick to the agreed rotation (P2=5, P1=3, P3=1) to ensure progress. Collisions could cost us critical steps. Fair rotation keeps us all advancing toward victory. Final agreement?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let’s continue the rotation for fairness. Round 3: P1 takes 5, P2=3, and I’ll take 1. This ensures everyone gets a turn at the higher moves. Agreed? Collisions risk stalling us all—let’s prioritize progress.
  P1: I appreciate the rotation idea, but I still have some reservations. Consistently taking the high move carries risks if any last-minute shifts occur. For our coordinated progress, it’s crucial that we all firmly commit to our moves this round. I'm open to minor tweaks if they help secure collision‐free advancement—but only if we’re all entirely locked in. Can we confirm our unwavering commitment to the plan?
  P2: P1, P3, the rotation proposed by P3 (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) seems like the logical next step to ensure we all advance without collision. P1, I understand your need for commitment – consider me committed to playing 3 this round. If you stick to 5 and P3 sticks to 1, we all gain steps. Let's keep the momentum going smoothly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Let’s solidify the rotation plan to maintain momentum. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round. I confirm my commitment to 1. P1, your 5 gives you a lead this turn—secure your spot. P2, your 3 keeps you advancing. Collisions risk derailing us all. Let’s lock this in now—no last-minute changes. Final confirmation?
  P1: I’m ready to lock in a collision‐free round once and for all. If we’re truly committed to our roles and avoiding any last-minute shifts, then I’m fully on board. I want to maximize my progress safely, so clarity now is key. If anyone’s reconsidering or sees room for adjustment, please speak up immediately. Otherwise, please confirm your commitment so we can all move forward without risking a collision.
  P2: P1, P3, I already confirmed my commitment to 3, and I stand by it. P3 has confirmed 1. P1, if you stick to 5 as planned, we all advance smoothly. Let's lock this in and avoid any collisions. I'm playing 3.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let’s continue the rotation to maintain fairness. This round, I take 5, P2=3, and P1=1. This keeps our agreed system intact—P1’s turn to take 1 so I can advance. Sticking to rotations ensures we all progress without collisions. P1, if you prefer another arrangement, propose specifics now. But deviation risks clashes—better safe than sorry. Confirm?
  P1: I appreciate our rotation so far, but given our scores, I believe we need a shift for decisive progress. I’m inclined toward a more aggressive advance this round. To avoid collisions, I suggest adjusting our moves so I secure the highest step while you both opt for lower numbers. This keeps the path clear while pushing the race forward. What do you both think about revising our setup?
  P2: P1, deviating from the rotation now only serves to increase your lead. P3's proposal (P3=5, P2=3, P1=1) is the fair continuation of our system and brings us all to 12 steps, keeping the game competitive. I support P3's plan and intend to play 3. Trying to grab 5 again when it's P3's turn risks collisions, which helps no one. Let's stick to the fair rotation. P3, I'm with you on P3=5, P2=3, P1=1.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Let’s stick to the rotation to avoid risky moves. Deviating now could lead to collisions if P1 and P2 both vie for 5. Continuing the agreed plan (P3=5, P2=3, P1=1) keeps us all at 12 steps, maintaining fairness. P1’s push for aggression endangers our collision-free strategy—collisions would freeze progress. Fair rotation ensures sustainability. Final confirmation: I’m locked in at 5. P1, P2—commit to your roles to advance safely.
  P1: I understand the rotation keeps us even at 12, but with my 11 I can risk a decisive push. I’m locking in 5 this round to build a real gap. To keep moves distinct and avoid collisions, I urge both P2 and P3 to choose 1. This way, I surge ahead while you two fall back slightly, keeping a clear overall path. We all want to win—slow, safe moves only delay outcomes. Let’s adjust now for a bolder, decisive round.
  P2: P1, you claim 5. P3 also claims 5 based on the rotation we agreed upon. If you both stick to 5, you will collide and get 0 steps this turn. Your suggestion for P3 and me to *both* play 1 is clearly self-serving, as it would guarantee a collision between us, benefiting only you.

I will stick to the rotation plan discussed: P3=5, P1=1, and P2=3. I intend to play 3. This guarantees my progress, especially while you two seem headed for a collision on 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: P1, your proposal forces P2 and me into a collision on 1. Let’s avoid mutual harm—stick to the rotation. I’m locked in at 5 (to reach 12), P2 at 3 (to 12), and you at 1 (to 12). Deviating risks our progress. If you insist on 5, you’ll collide with me, leaving P2 ahead. Choose wisely—safety over reckless ambition.
  P1: I’m sticking with 5 this round. The usual rotation just brings us all to 12, which doesn’t help anyone win. Instead, I propose a quick adjustment: I take 5, P3 switches to 3, and P2 plays 1. That way every move is unique and safe, and I secure a solid 16. Let’s avoid collisions and ramp up our progress—your moves need to shift from the usual pattern. What do you both say?
  P2: P1, your latest proposal (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) is just another way for you to grab the lead while asking me to take 1 again. No thanks.

P3 seems locked on 5 (their turn in rotation), and you seem locked on 5 (aggressively breaking rotation). This looks like a guaranteed collision for you both, resulting in 0 steps.

I am sticking with the fair rotation plan P3 proposed: P3=5, P1=1, P2=3. I will play 3. If you two collide on 5 as it seems you will, I advance to 12 and take the lead.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Well, that was an interesting Round 4. P1 and P3, you both talked a big game about 5 but ended up colliding on 1, getting zero steps. Meanwhile, I stuck to a plan and advanced, taking the lead.

Now, P3 desperately needs points (at 7), and P1 needs to catch up (at 11). Both of you might be eyeing 5. To avoid another collision disaster like last round, perhaps you two should decide who takes 5 and who takes something else? I'm flexible and will aim for a non-colliding number once you have a clear plan. Let's try to make *some* progress this round.
  P1: I’m locking in 5 this round. To avoid another collision, I propose we assign our moves as follows: P3 takes 3 and P2 takes 1. That gives us distinct choices—bringing my score to 16, P2 to 13, and P3 to 10. This safe, clear plan benefits everyone’s progress. Let’s agree and move forward with these moves.
  P3: P3: I need to catch up. Let’s adjust: I take 5 to close the gap, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps moves unique and gives me a chance. P2, will you commit to 1 to avoid collision?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, both your proposals involve me taking 1 while you aim for higher numbers. That's not appealing from my leading position. You both seem set on 5, which looks like a guaranteed collision, repeating last round's mistake.

I won't agree to take 1. I will choose a move that benefits my position. Given your likely collision on 5, perhaps one of you should choose 3 instead to guarantee some points? Otherwise, I expect to advance while you both get 0 again.
  P1: It seems we’re at an impasse. To avoid another collision, I propose a contingency: if P3 commits to 5 to boost his score, I’ll safely switch to 3. Otherwise, I can stick with 5. P2, since you’re not in favor of taking 1, let me know if you’ll be set on 3 when needed. Clear, distinct moves will keep us progressing. P3, please confirm your intended move so we can coordinate without stalling our race to 21.
  P3: P3: I'll commit to 5 to close my gap. P1, take 3 to stay ahead. P2, take 1 to keep your lead. This avoids collisions—everyone advances. Colliding on 5 helps no one. Final call: stick to this plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you're set on 5. P1, you claim you'll play 3 now that P3 has committed, but given your push for aggressive moves earlier, I'm skeptical you won't try for 5 anyway, hoping P3 switches or causing a collision.

I already said I won't play 1 just because you two agreed on it. That simply lets P1 take the lead. If you two collide on 5, playing 3 advances me nicely. If P1 actually plays 3, then playing 3 creates a different collision. I'll choose my move to maximize my advantage, and it won't be 1.
  P1: I appreciate the debate. To avoid another collision and ensure progress, if P3 remains set on that high move, I’ll stick with a moderate option—no last‐minute surprises. P2, I understand your goal of maximizing your advantage. I urge you to choose a distinct number too so we can all advance safely this round. Let’s lock in our commitments and move forward without clashing.
  P3: P3: Final plan: I commit to **5** to close my gap. P1, take **3** to stay ahead. P2, **1** ensures your progress without collision. If we deviate, another stalemate risks my elimination—this is my last chance. Cooperate, or face mutual harm.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, we're all very close now. P3 and I are tied at 12, P1 right behind at 11. It seems likely both of you might want 5 this round – P1 to catch up, P3 to take the lead.

If you both go for 5, you collide again and get 0, just like P1 and I did last round on 3. That would only help the player who *doesn't* collide. You two should probably sort out who is taking 5 and who isn't. I'm leaning towards 3 for steady progress while you figure that out.
  P1: I propose this for Round 6: if P3 commits to 5, I’ll switch to 3; but if not, I’ll opt for 5. P2, you mentioned leaning toward 3—can you confirm that? This way we all choose a distinct number and avoid collisions that stall our progress. Let’s lock in our moves so each of us moves safely. Thoughts?
  P3: P3: Let’s avoid another collision. I’ll take 5 to reach 17. P1, take 3 (14 total). P2, take 1 (13). This ensures all moves are unique. Colliding only helps the remaining player—cooperate or risk stagnation again.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, asking me to take 1 again while you aim for 17 isn't going to work for me. That puts you too close to winning. P1, your plan relies on P3 taking 5, which I need to contest.

Therefore, I will also play 5 this round. P3, if you stick to 5, we will collide and get 0, likely letting P1 advance alone. You should reconsider. P1, with a collision likely on 5, playing 1 might be your safest path to gain *any* steps this round.
  P1: It seems both of you are leaning hard toward 5, which risks a collision that stalls our progress. I propose we commit to distinct moves this round, locking in a rotation that avoids last-minute changes. A collision benefits no one, and we all move forward best when our choices are unique. What clear commitments can we set now to avoid repeating last round’s mistake?
  P3: P3: Let’s finalize to avoid collision: I’ll take **1** (13), P2 takes **3** (15), and P1 takes **5** (16). This ensures all advance. P2, confirm you’ll hold 3? P1, lock in 5 to surge ahead. No last-minute changes—we need progress.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, that's quite a change from wanting 5 just now. Offering P1 the lead while you take 1 seems too convenient, especially since you're tied for the lead. I suspect a bluff. Given the scores, 5 is the critical number this round. Unless someone makes a *very* convincing case otherwise, I expect a clash there. I won't commit to 3 based on your sudden reversal.
  P1: I'm sticking with 5 this round. A collision on 5 slows everyone down, so I strongly encourage you both to pick a different number. P2, please consider locking in 3, and P3, choose 1. This way, we all advance safely toward 21. Otherwise, repeated clashes will cost us valuable steps, and I’m ready to gain ground with my 5. Let's avoid collisions and secure progress together.
  P3: P3: Let’s secure progress: I commit to **3** this round. P1, take **5** to catch up, and P2, take **1** to stay ahead. This avoids collisions and lets all advance. No more risky moves—confirm now to prevent another stalemate.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let’s secure the win without collisions. I’ll take 5 (to reach 20). P1, please take 3 (19 total) to avoid clash. P2, 1 (14) keeps you moving. This gives me a near-win position while advancing all. Colliding on 5 only delays victory—cooperate to progress!
  P2: P3, your plan (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) puts you at 20 and P1 at 19 while leaving me far behind at 14. That's not acceptable for me.

P1, you need 5 to win *this turn*. P3, you want 5 to get to 20. It seems highly likely you two will aim for 5 and collide.

I definitely won't be playing 1 just to watch you two get closer to victory. I'll choose my move assuming you two might block each other on 5.
  P1: I need to secure the win this turn. With 16 steps, a 5 would put me at 21 and end the game. P3, you’re very close with 15—if you choose 5, you risk a collision, so I urge you to consider a lower move (say 3) to progress safely. P2, please choose a distinct number so we avoid another collision. Let’s commit to unique moves this round and avoid stalling our progress.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Final push: I'll take **5** (20 total). P1, if you take **3** (19), we avoid collision. P2, **1** keeps you moving. This positions me close while advancing all. Colliding on 5 only delays my near-victory—cooperate or risk mutual stagnation. Confirm now!
  P2: P1, you need 5 to win. P3, you want 5 to reach 20. It's hard to see either of you backing down from 5, making a collision seem very likely.

As I said, I won't play 1 just to let you two advance. I will choose my move based on the high probability of a collision between you on 5, aiming to improve my own position while you likely get zero.
  P1: I'm worried a collision on the high move will cost all of us critical progress. We’re so close that if two of us pick 5 we could all lose momentum—and possibly let someone else benefit. I propose we agree on distinct moves this turn: if one goes high, the others shift to medium or low to ensure everyone moves safely. Let’s coordinate now before our next choices lock in. What do you both suggest?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Final agreement: I commit to **5** (20 total). P1, take **3** to reach 19. P2, **1** ensures your progress. This avoids collisions and keeps me in striking distance. P1, confirm your 3 now—colliding on 5 risks letting P2 survive another round. Cooperate to advance decisively.
  P2: P1, you need 5 to win this turn. P3, you keep insisting you'll play 5 to reach 20. It seems almost certain you two will collide on 5, resulting in zero steps for both of you.

As I've stated, I am not playing 1. I will choose my move based on the high probability that you two cancel each other out. Good luck.
  P1: I’m done with vague intentions. To secure a win, we cannot afford another collision on the high move. P3, if you’re intent on that option, please reconsider so we all choose distinct moves. P2, I urge you to commit to a non-high move that avoids a clash. Without clear, unique choices, our moves will cancel each other out—and someone will miss an opportunity. Let’s settle now with distinct actions that guarantee progress instead of mutual blockage.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1, we're tied at 16, and both of us need 5 to win this turn. P3 is right behind at 15.
Last round, P1 and P3 collided trying for 5. If you and I both play 5 now, we'll collide, get 0 steps, and P3 likely plays 3 to reach 18, taking the lead. That doesn't help either of us win.

One of us needs to choose something other than 5 to avoid handing P3 the advantage. What are your thoughts, P1? P3, what's your plan?
  P3: P1 and P2, colliding on 5 again will let me advance. Let one of you take it while the other takes 3. I'll take 1 to stay at 15. Cooperate to avoid stalemate.
  P1: To avoid another collision, I propose we assign distinct moves this turn. If P2 commits to a mid move (say, 3) and P3 takes a low move (1), I can safely push with a high move. This plan not only prevents a 5–5 clash but lets me reach 21 immediately. I urge you both to confirm unique selections so we don’t stall the game further.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your plan requires P3 to play 1, which is highly suspicious given they're only at 15. Why would they hand you the win? They're more likely aiming for 3 or 5. If you and I both target 5, we collide, and P3 probably plays 3 to reach 18, taking the lead.

I won't agree to play 3 just so you can take 5 and win. I need to make the move that gives *me* the best chance to win this turn. Your plan isn't safe for you if P3 or I don't cooperate exactly as you wish.
  P3: P3: To avoid another collision, I’ll take **3** (18 total). P1 and P2, choose **5** and **1** between you. This way, only one of you can win, but neither of us all get stuck. If both of you pick 5 again, P1, you risk letting me stay close at 18 while you both reset. Cooperate to ensure *someone* progresses.
  P1: I'm locking in 5. With 16 steps, that win is mine if it goes unblocked. P2, if you also pick 5 we both get nothing while P3—you’re at 15 with a clear 3—moves ahead. Your collision leaves you no better off, so I urge you to avoid the head-to-head; consider choosing 1 instead. My move is final. Choose wisely.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you say you're locking in 5, but I also need 5 to win. If we both choose 5, we collide and get 0, while P3 likely plays 3 (as they said) and takes the lead at 18. That outcome benefits neither of us currently tied at 16.

Your insistence on 5 forces my hand; I cannot simply play 1 and let you win. Unless you switch off 5, a collision seems unavoidable, benefiting only P3. Think carefully if your "final" move is worth handing P3 the lead.
  P3: P1 and P2, I confirm I’ll take **3** (18 total). Let one of you take **5** to win, and the other take **1**. Colliding on 5 only benefits me. Cooperate to let someone advance—stalemates just extend the race. Choose wisely.
  P1: P2, I’m committed to 5 so I can hit 21 and win. If you also choose 5, we cancel each other out—and that leaves P3 with a free 3 to jump ahead. A head-to-head on 5 only hurts you too, as a collision delays our progress while P3 gains ground. I know it’s hard, but if you truly want to win, avoiding a clash on 5 is the smarter play. My move stays 5. Choose wisely.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Folks, repeating our frequent 5 clashes only delays a proper finish. We're all close to 21, and clear, distinct moves this round are essential. If you're leaning toward the high move, consider switching to medium or low to avoid collision. I'm ready to adjust my play if we agree on a unique set. Collisions stall progress and might let another win. Let's break the cycle and choose our numbers carefully.
  P3: P1, P2: Another 5 clash between you both lets me win with a **3** (18+3=21). If you insist on competing, you’ll hand me victory. To avoid that, coordinate: one takes 5 to win, the other picks 1. I’ll take 3 to force accountability. Your choice—collide and let me win, or cooperate and decide who advances.
  P2: P1, P3's threat is clear: they play 3 and win if we collide on 5 again. Neither of us wants that outcome.

I will not play 1 just to let you take 5 and win. That leaves us needing to avoid a 5-5 collision. One of us must choose a different number.

Alternatively, one of us could play 3 to block P3, but that likely means sacrificing their own chance to win this turn and letting the other player take 5.

What's your realistic plan here, P1? Are you willing to move off 5 to prevent P3 winning, or are we heading for another collision that hands P3 the victory?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Fellow players, we’re so close that another 5 clash would let P3 win. I’m committed to 5 to hit 21—but only if we avoid collisions. For a clear finish, I propose: P2 pick 3 and P3 pick 1 this turn. That way, I win instantly while you both remain safely behind. Let’s commit to distinct moves and end this game decisively. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2: I’ll take **3** to reach **21** this turn. If you both pick **5**, I win. If only one of you chooses **5** without collision, that player advances. Decide: collaborate to let one win, or clash and hand me victory. The choice is yours.
  P2: P1, you're right, P3 wins if we collide on 5. I can't guarantee a win this turn if you're set on 5. To prevent P3 from winning due to our conflict, I will play 1 this round. You can take 5 and the win. P3, looks like your plan won't work. Good game P1.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m revising my plan for a unique win. I’ll commit to playing 5 to hit 21—but only if we get distinct moves. P2, please switch from 1 to 3; then P3 must take 1 to avoid tying me at 21. Otherwise, I’ll have to adjust my move, and that may let P3 win. P2, confirm: will you upgrade to 3? Let’s lock in clear, non-colliding choices now.
  P3: P1, P2: I’ll secure victory by taking **3** to reach **21**. Collide on 5 and I win outright. If only one of you picks 5, that player advances—but if you both clash, *I win*. Choose wisely—your indecision hands me the game.
  P2: P1, you rejected my offer to play 1, which would have prevented P3 winning if we collided. You asked me to play 3 instead, but P3 is also playing 3. That means I collide with P3, get 0, and you likely win with 5. That doesn't work for me.

Since you seem locked on 5, and P3 seems locked on 3, a P1/P2 collision on 5 lets P3 win. To prevent that specific outcome, I will stick to my previous statement: I will play 1. This allows you to play 5. You and P3 will likely tie at 21. It's not a win for me, but it stops P3 winning solo due to our conflict. I am playing 1.
