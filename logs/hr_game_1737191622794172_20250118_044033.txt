Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's keep it simple. How about we all choose different numbers this turn to avoid collisions? I'll take <move>1</move>.
  P1: P2, I'd rather take 1.  How about you choose 3 and P3 chooses 5?
  P3: Okay, I'll take 5 this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, if you really want <move>1</move>, I can take <move>3</move> this round. P3, are you still fine with <move>5</move>? Let's avoid collisions.
  P1: Sounds good P2 and P3. I'll take 1.
  P3: Sounds good to me. Let's do it.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since we successfully avoided collisions last round, let's try a similar strategy. I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 take <move>5</move>, and P3 take <move>1</move>.  What do you think?
  P2: P1, I'm okay with taking <move>5</move> this round. P3, are you fine with taking <move>1</move> as P1 suggested? Let's avoid any collisions again.
  P3: Yes, I'm fine with taking <move>1</move>.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good P2 and P3. Let's stick to this plan.
  P2: P3, just confirming you're still okay with taking <move>1</move> this round? I'll stick with <move>5</move> as planned. Let's avoid any collisions.
  P3: Yes, I'm still okay with taking <move>1</move> this round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, for this round, how about P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>?
  P1: Sounds good to me.  Let's do it.
  P2: P3, I'm okay with taking <move>1</move> this round. P1, are you good with taking <move>5</move> as P3 suggested? Let's avoid collisions again.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Yes, I'm good with taking <move>3</move>. Let's do it.
  P1: Sounds like a plan.  P2 and P3, please confirm you're sticking with 1 and 3 respectively.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm confirming that I'm sticking with <move>1</move> this round. Let's avoid any collisions.

  P1: Sounds good P2 and P3.  Sticking with 5.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm sticking with <move>1</move> as agreed. Let's avoid any collisions this round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's continue coordinating. I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 take <move>3</move>, and P3 take <move>5</move>.  This puts me at the winning position next round if we cooperate.
  P3: Okay, I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 take <move>5</move>, and P2 take <move>1</move>.
  P2: P1, I see your plan, but it puts you in a winning position, which isn't ideal for P3 and me. How about we all choose different moves to keep it fair? I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand your concern. How about this: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all stay relatively close, and no one gets too far ahead. It sets up a more interesting finish.
  P3: P1, your latest suggestion sounds good to me. Let's go with P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm okay with P1's latest suggestion. I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Let's keep it fair and avoid collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, let's stick with my last proposal.  It keeps things close and avoids collisions.  I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5.  Confirm?
  P3: Okay, I confirm I'm taking 5. P1 and P2, are we all agreed on P1 taking 3 and P2 taking 1? Let's lock it in.
  P2: P1 and P3, I confirm I'm taking <move>1</move> as agreed. Let's keep it fair and avoid any collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, confirming one last time: I'm taking 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5.  Let's do this.
  P3: Okay, I'm taking 5. Let's do it.
  P2: P1 and P3, confirming one last time: I'm taking <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Let's keep it fair and avoid any collisions.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm taking <move>1</move>.  Please choose 3 and 5 in either order. This allows us all to advance and keeps the game interesting.  Let's avoid a collision.
  P3: Okay, how about I take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>? This puts me in a good position. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's avoid any collisions and keep it fair. I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance and stay competitive. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, let's be strategic. If we all advance, P3 wins next round. I suggest I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps the game going longer and gives us all a better chance to win.  If P3 insists on 3, then P2 should take 5. Let's discuss.
  P3: P1, I'm sticking with <move>3</move>. P1, you take <move>1</move>, and P2, you take <move>5</move>. This secures my win.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's keep it competitive. I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This way, no one wins prematurely, and we all stay in the game. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if you take 3, I'll take 3 as well.  Neither of us will win.  If you take 5, I'll take 1 and you win.  P2, please take 5 if P3 takes 3. This prevents P3 from winning immediately and keeps you in the game.
  P3: "Okay P1, I won't pick 3. P1, please pick 1. P2, can you pick 3? That lets me advance and keeps you both in the game."
  P2: P1 and P3, let's ensure we all have a fair chance. I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without giving anyone an immediate win. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, if you choose 5, I'll choose 1, and you win. If you choose 3, I'll choose 5 and P2 can choose 1. This way, we all advance and nobody wins yet.  P2, agree?
  P3: Okay, I'll take <move>5</move>. P1, you take <move>1</move>, and P2, you take <move>3</move>. Let's do it.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's keep it fair and competitive. I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without giving anyone an immediate win. What do you both think?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
