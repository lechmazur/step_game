Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's start by coordinating our moves to avoid collisions. How about P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5 this round? This way, we all move forward without any conflicts. Thoughts?
  P1: I'm with P3. Let's go 1, 3, 5 to avoid conflicts. Let's all move accordingly.

  P1: Agreed. Let's move forward with the plan. Trust and cooperation will keep us all progressing. Ready?
  P2: Let’s stay committed to the 1-3-5 plan we all agreed on. If we each stick to our roles—P1: 1, me: 3, P3: 5—we all move forward without setbacks. Breaking the deal only slows us all down. Let’s build trust early and keep the momentum going. Ready to move?

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:

  P1: Agreed. Let’s stick to 1, 3, 5. No more mistakes. P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. Trust and cooperation—this time, *strictly*. Let’s move.

  P3: P3: P2, you've broken trust twice now. It's crucial we get back on track. Let's adjust the plan: P2, you take <move>1</move> to ensure you move forward. P1 will take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without collisions. Trust needs to be rebuilt, and actions speak louder than words. Let's confirm and move. Agreed?
  P2: Understood—I've broken trust, and I need to earn it back. I'm on board with the new plan: I take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This setup avoids collisions and lets us all advance. I’ll stick to it—no tricks. Let’s move forward cleanly this time.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Confirmed. P2:1, P1:3, P3:5. Let's all move without collisions. Trust and cooperation.
  P3: P3: Alright, let's finalize our plan for this round. P2, you've acknowledged the need to rebuild trust, and I appreciate that.

Trust is essential, and sticking to our agreed moves will keep the game moving smoothly. Let's move forward with this plan. Everyone agreed?

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3 — I stuck to <move>1</move> last round as promised, and it paid off with no collisions. I hope that starts to rebuild some trust. Let’s keep that momentum. How about we repeat last round’s plan: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I stick to 1 again. It worked once—let’s make it work again.
  P1: P2, I'm with you. Let's stick to 1,3,5 again. P3, let's avoid past mistakes. All move forward. No collisions this time. Commit to it.
  P3: P3: P2, you've shown commitment by sticking to <move>1</move> last round. Let's build on that trust. However, we need to adjust to avoid another collision. How about this: P2 takes <move>1</move> again, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, we all move forward without any conflicts. Let's confirm and move forward with this plan. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I see your logic, but switching roles again could cause confusion or suspicion. Last round’s plan (P2:1, P1:3, P3:5) worked cleanly—why not stick with what’s proven? If we keep changing roles, it opens the door for mistrust. Let’s stay consistent one more round and build momentum.
  P1: Let’s stick to the proven plan: P2 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. Consistency ensures no collisions. Trust this strategy—no risks, all advance. Let’s move forward together.
  P3: P3: Alright, let's find a middle ground. P2, your consistency is noted, and P1, your strategy makes sense. However, to ensure no collisions and rebuild full trust, let's slightly adjust: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This avoids past conflicts and keeps us all moving. Let's confirm this plan and move forward. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I hear you, but changing roles now might reignite mistrust. We finally had a clean round—why risk it? Let’s stick to the same proven plan: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Consistency builds trust and progress. One more clean round will benefit us all. Let’s not overcomplicate it.
  P1: P1: Let's assign moves to avoid collision: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, I take 5. All advance. No risks this time. Commit to this plan.
  P3: P3: Alright, let's finalize our plan for this round. P2, you've been consistent with <move>1</move>, and P1, you've shown reliability. Let's stick to the adjusted plan to ensure no collisions: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This avoids past issues and keeps us moving forward. Trust and cooperation are key. Let's confirm one last time: P2: 1, P1: 5, P3: 3. Ready to move?

This has worked well for us, so let's stick to it. Trust and consistency will keep us all advancing. Let's finalize and move forward. Everyone ready?

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: P2, you've broken trust again by deviating from the plan. This is becoming a pattern, and it's affecting all of us. Let's try a new approach to ensure we all move forward. How about this: P2, you take <move>1</move> to rebuild trust, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without collisions. Trust needs to be rebuilt, and actions speak louder than words. Let's confirm and move. Agreed?

Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P2, I appreciate your acknowledgment, but actions will speak louder than words at this point. To ensure we all advance and avoid past mistakes, let's slightly adjust: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>.
