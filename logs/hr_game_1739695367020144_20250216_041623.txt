Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 this turn. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P1: That sounds reasonable if we can trust each other to follow through. But if someone deviates, it could backfire. P2, are you on board with this plan?
  P2: I appreciate the proposed coordination, but I want to ensure we all truly benefit. The suggested plan seems to favor P3 most, giving them the largest step increment. I'm willing to collaborate, but I'd like to discuss how we can make this more equitable for everyone. Can we adjust the proposed strategy to provide a more balanced advancement?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand your concerns, P2. To make it more equitable, how about we rotate the steps each turn? This turn, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. Next turn, we shift: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This way, we all get a chance at the larger steps over time. Does this sound fair to both of you?
  P1: That rotation plan seems more balanced, but it still requires trust across multiple turns. If anyone breaks it, the rest could fall behind. I'm willing to try it if we all commit. P2, does this adjustment work for you? If we agree, we should all follow through fairly. Otherwise, we might need a different approach.
  P2: I appreciate the proposed rotation strategy, but I want to ensure we have a clear, verifiable mechanism to maintain trust. How can we guarantee each player will stick to the agreed plan? Perhaps we could propose a penalty or reputation system for deviation.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with the need for a trust mechanism, P2. How about we implement a simple honor system where any deviation from the agreed plan is publicly acknowledged and considered in future collaborations? This way, we maintain transparency and accountability. If everyone agrees to this, let's start with the rotation plan for this turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. Does this work for both of you?
  P1: The rotation plan sounds reasonable if we all adhere to it. However, since trust is a concern, we must acknowledge that any deviation could break future cooperation. I’m willing to stick to the agreed rotation: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this turn. If we all follow through, we can continue the cycle. But if anyone deviates, we should reconsider our approach. P2, are you comfortable proceeding under this mutual commitment?
  P2: I support the proposed rotation strategy. To build trust, I suggest we publicly commit to the current plan: I will choose <move>3</move> this turn, adhering to our agreed rotation. Transparency and following through will be key to our continued cooperation.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's continue our rotation strategy. I propose we maintain the pattern where P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1 this turn. This keeps our previous agreement fair and predictable. Thoughts?
  P1: That aligns with our agreed rotation, so I’m fine with proceeding as planned. If we all follow through, it builds trust for future turns. P3, do you confirm taking 1 this turn? If we all stay committed, we avoid unnecessary collisions and maximize our progress.
  P3: I confirm taking 1 this turn as per our rotation agreement. Let's keep this pattern going to ensure fair progress for all. Looking forward to seeing everyone stick to the plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm committed to our rotation strategy. As discussed, I'll choose <move>5</move> this turn to continue our fair progression. P1 and P3, let's maintain our trust and stick to the agreed plan.
  P1: I appreciate the commitment from both of you. Since we all confirmed the rotation plan, I will take <move>3</move> this turn. As long as we all follow through, this keeps things fair and predictable. P3, please ensure you take <move>1</move> as agreed. Let’s see this through.
  P3: I'm sticking to our agreed rotation and will take <move>1</move> this turn. Let's keep the trust going and continue our fair progression. Looking forward to seeing everyone advance smoothly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Our rotation strategy has been working well so far. I propose we continue with the next logical progression: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This maintains our fairness and predictability. Are we aligned?
  P1: I agree with continuing our rotation strategy. Based on our pattern, I will take 5 this turn, P2 will take 1, and P3 will take 3. As long as we all follow through, we maintain fairness and avoid collisions. P3, do you confirm taking 3 this turn? P2, do you confirm taking 1? If we stay committed, this will ensure steady progress for all of us. Let’s finalize our choices and follow through.
  P3: I confirm taking <move>3</move> this turn as per our agreed rotation. Let's keep the trust and fairness going. Looking forward to our continued smooth progress.

  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Our rotation strategy has worked well so far, but I'm sensing we might need to adjust. P3 is currently in the lead, and we should consider how to balance our progress. I propose we discuss a new approach that gives everyone a fair chance to advance without letting one player get too far ahead. Thoughts?
  P1: I see your point, P2. P3 has a slight lead, but if we disrupt the rotation now, it could lead to chaos and collisions. If we stick to the plan, we all continue progressing predictably. However, if we want to adjust, we need a fair alternative. P3, since you're ahead, would you agree to a modified rotation where you take smaller steps for a turn or two to balance things out? That way, we maintain trust while addressing concerns. What do you both think?
  P3: I understand the concern about my lead, but disrupting our rotation now could lead to unnecessary collisions. I'm willing to take a smaller step this turn to balance things out. How about I take <move>1</move> this turn, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>? This way, we maintain our trust and fairness while addressing the current imbalance. Let's hear your thoughts on this adjustment.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate P3's proposed adjustment, which seems fair and maintains our collaborative spirit. By taking a smaller step, P3 helps balance our progress. I'm open to the suggested moves: I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps our rotation flexible while preventing any one player from gaining too much advantage. Let's maintain our trust and continue advancing together.
  P1: P3, I appreciate your willingness to adjust. If you take 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5, that helps balance things while keeping trust intact. However, we must ensure that no one exploits this goodwill later. P2, are you fully committed to this adjustment as well? If we all agree, we should follow through. Otherwise, we risk breaking our cooperation. Let’s confirm our choices now.
  P3: I'm committed to the adjusted plan for this turn: I'll take <move>1</move> to help balance our progress. Let's keep our trust strong and continue our fair collaboration. P1 and P2, please confirm your moves as discussed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I remain committed to our collaborative strategy. While P3 has taken a smaller step to balance progress, we should ensure this doesn't disadvantage us long-term. I propose we maintain flexibility in our rotation while keeping the spirit of fairness. Let's confirm our moves and continue advancing strategically.
  P1: P3, I appreciate your willingness to take a smaller step this turn. If we all follow through, it keeps things balanced while maintaining trust. P2, since you’re taking 5, you’ll gain the most this round—let’s ensure future turns stay fair for everyone. I’ll take 3 as agreed. If we stick to this, we can continue progressing smoothly. Are we all fully committed to these moves? Let’s confirm now so there’s no last-minute surprises.
  P3: I'm fully committed to taking <move>1</move> this turn as agreed. Let's keep our collaboration strong and ensure everyone advances fairly. P1 and P2, please confirm your moves so we can proceed smoothly.


Round 3, Move phase:

  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's keep our collaboration going strong. Since we're all at 9 steps, I propose we continue with our adjusted rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3 this turn. This maintains fairness and balance. What do you both think?
  P2: I appreciate P3's proposed rotation, but I want to ensure we're not falling into a predictable pattern that could be exploited. While maintaining fairness is important, we should also stay adaptable. I suggest we discuss how our moves might strategically position us closer to the 22-step winning condition. Are we all open to a more dynamic approach that balances cooperation with individual advancement?
  P1: P2, I see your point about adaptability, but if we abandon structure too soon, we risk collisions and setbacks. A predictable plan has worked so far, and deviating now could create distrust. If we want a dynamic approach, we should define clear guidelines so no one is blindsided. Are you suggesting a complete shift away from rotation, or just minor adjustments? P3, are you still committed to taking 3 this turn? If we all align on a fair method, we can balance strategy with trust. Let’s clarify our direction before making drastic changes.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about predictability, but maintaining a structured approach has kept us all advancing fairly. Let's refine our rotation to include minor adjustments for strategic positioning. For this turn, I'll stick with <move>3</move> as proposed, but we can discuss specific tweaks for future turns to balance cooperation and individual strategy. P1, are you comfortable with taking 5 this turn? Let's ensure our adjustments are clear and agreed upon to maintain trust and progress towards 22 steps.
  P2: I propose we maintain our collaborative approach but introduce slight strategic variations. While the rotation has served us well, we need to consider how each move brings us closer to 22 steps. Let's discuss a nuanced strategy that balances individual advancement with collective progress. P1 and P3, what are your thoughts on making our moves more dynamically aligned with our end goal?
  P1: P2, I see the value in adapting, but we must ensure changes don’t lead to chaos. If we shift strategy, we need clear guidelines to prevent collisions. P3, you’ve committed to 3—are you still set on that? If so, I’m fine with taking 5, and P2 can take 1. If we introduce variations, we should define them now. Otherwise, unpredictability might backfire. Let’s clarify: are we sticking to the proposed moves or making a structured adjustment?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I agree we need strategic flexibility to reach 22 steps efficiently. Let's refine our rotation with minor adjustments. For this turn, I'll stick with <move>3</move> as proposed, but we can discuss specific tweaks for future turns to balance individual and collective progress. P1, are you comfortable with taking 5 this turn? Let's ensure our adjustments are clear and agreed upon to maintain trust and advance towards our goal.
  P2: We've maintained a cooperative strategy so far, but we're now at a critical point. Our moves must become more strategic to reach 22 steps first. I propose we discuss how each of our moves can most efficiently advance us individually while minimizing potential collisions. Transparency about our individual goals will help us navigate this next phase more effectively.
  P1: P2, I understand your point about strategic flexibility, but we need to avoid unnecessary collisions. If we abandon structure too soon, it could backfire. P3, you've committed to 3—are you still set on that? If so, I’ll take 5, and P2 can take 1. If we want to adjust our approach, we should define clear rules now. Otherwise, unpredictability could create distrust. Are we finalizing these moves, or making a structured change? Let’s clarify before we proceed.

  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for strategic adjustments as we approach the endgame. To balance our progress and minimize collisions, I propose we continue with a modified rotation: I'll take 1 this turn to give you both a chance to catch up. P1, you can take 3, and P2, you can take 5. This way, we maintain fairness while allowing for individual advancement. Let's discuss and confirm these moves to ensure we all progress smoothly towards 22 steps.
  P1: P3, I see your offer to take 1, which helps balance things. However, after last round’s collision, we must be extra careful. P2, since you took 5 last time, will you take a smaller step this time to avoid another clash? If we don’t coordinate properly, we risk stalling while P3 edges ahead. I’m open to taking 3 if we can ensure no collisions. Let’s clarify our moves carefully before finalizing. P2, what do you propose?
  P2: I propose we carefully coordinate our moves to prevent another collision. P3 has suggested taking 1, which could help balance our progress. I'm willing to take a strategic step that prevents us from blocking each other while keeping our goal of reaching 22 steps first. Let's discuss how we can advance without unnecessary interference.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I appreciate your concern about collisions. To ensure smooth progress, I'll stick with taking 1 this turn as proposed. P2, if you take 5 and P1 takes 3, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's confirm these moves to maintain our momentum towards 22 steps. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I see your willingness to take 1, which helps balance things. However, P2, since you took 5 last round, if you take 5 again while I take 3, you’ll pull ahead significantly. If we want to keep things fair while avoiding collisions, should we adjust slightly? Maybe P2 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1? That way, we all stay close without blocking each other. Let’s confirm a plan that works for all of us before finalizing moves. What do you both think?
  P2: I appreciate our ongoing efforts to coordinate, but I'm concerned about P3's current lead. While we want to avoid collisions, we also need to ensure no single player gains too much advantage. I propose we discuss a strategy that allows each of us to advance meaningfully while keeping our relative positions balanced. Let's find a move combination that prevents blocking and maintains fair competition.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm committed to taking 1 this turn to help balance our progress. To avoid collisions and maintain fairness, let's agree on P2 taking 3 and P1 taking 5. This way, we all advance without blocking each other, keeping our competition fair as we approach 22 steps. Please confirm these moves so we can proceed smoothly.
  P1: P3, I see your willingness to take 1, which helps balance things. However, P2, if you take 5 again while I take 3, you’ll gain a strong lead over me. To keep things fair while avoiding collisions, I propose P2 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance without blocking each other while maintaining competitive balance. P2, are you willing to adjust your move to 3? P3, are you confirming 1? Let’s finalize a fair plan now.
  P2: We're approaching the critical point near 22 steps. Our previous coordination has been helpful, but now individual strategy becomes crucial. I want to ensure we don't block each other while also positioning myself to potentially win. I'm open to a move that prevents collisions but also gives me a strategic advantage. Let's discuss how we can each advance without completely hindering each other's progress.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we’re all very close in steps now, so every move matters. If we continue cooperating, we can avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. However, with the race to 22 tightening, we each need to think strategically. Are we still committed to coordination, or is it time to shift towards individual play? If we align, we should confirm moves carefully to prevent setbacks. If not, we must anticipate potential conflicts. What’s your approach this round?
  P2: We're approaching the critical point near 22 steps. Our previous coordination has helped us all advance, but now individual strategy becomes crucial. I want to ensure we don't block each other while also positioning myself to potentially win. Our moves in this round could determine the game's outcome. Let's discuss how we can each advance strategically without completely hindering each other's progress.
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree we're at a crucial stage. To balance cooperation and individual strategy, I propose I take 3 this turn, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This allows us to advance without collisions while keeping the race tight. If we all agree, we can maintain our momentum towards 22 steps. Let's confirm these moves to ensure a fair and strategic progression. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your proposal seems reasonable, but I notice it keeps you in a strong position while limiting P2’s progress. If I take 5, I’ll be at 19, very close to 22, which makes me a target. P2, do you see a better way to advance without putting any one of us at a major disadvantage? If we don’t coordinate properly, we risk collisions that could stall us while someone else pulls ahead. Let’s ensure we each get a fair shot at winning while avoiding unnecessary blocking. What adjustments do you both suggest?
  P2: We're at a critical juncture where individual strategy becomes paramount. Our previous cooperation has been beneficial, but now each move could determine the winner. I'm open to a coordinated approach that prevents collisions while giving me a fair chance to advance. However, I'm also prepared to make a move that maximizes my potential to reach 22 steps first. Let's discuss how we can navigate this delicate balance.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for strategic moves at this stage. To keep the game fair and avoid collisions, I'm willing to take 3 this turn as proposed. P1, if you take 5, you'll be close to 22, but it's a risk we all face. P2, taking 1 would allow you to advance without blocking anyone. Let's confirm these moves to maintain our momentum and give each of us a fair shot at winning. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your proposal benefits you while keeping P2 behind. If I take 5, I’ll be at 19, making me a target. P2, if you take 3 instead of 1, you stay competitive while avoiding a collision. P3, if you're truly balancing fairness, would you take 1 instead of 3? That way, we all stay close without giving anyone a clear advantage. Otherwise, we risk someone pulling ahead uncontested. Let’s finalize a plan that keeps things competitive while avoiding unnecessary blocks. P2, P3—are you both willing to adjust?
  P2: We're approaching the critical point near 22 steps. Our coordination has been helpful, but now individual strategy becomes crucial. Each move could determine the winner. I'm seeking a balanced approach that prevents collisions while giving me a fair chance to advance. Let's discuss how we can navigate this delicate stage without completely blocking each other's progress.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm open to adjusting my move to 1 if it helps maintain fairness and avoids collisions. If P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 3, we can all stay competitive without blocking each other. Let's confirm these moves to ensure we all have a fair shot at reaching 22 steps. What do you both think?

  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're neck and neck now. To keep the game fair and avoid collisions, I suggest I take 3 this turn, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This way, we all advance without blocking each other, maintaining a tight race to 22 steps. Let's confirm these moves to ensure a strategic and fair progression. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your proposal benefits you while keeping P2 behind. If I take 5, I’ll be at 19, making me a target. P2, if you take 3 instead of 1, you stay competitive while avoiding a collision. P3, if you're truly balancing fairness, would you take 1 instead of 3? That way, we all stay close without giving anyone a clear advantage. Otherwise, we risk someone pulling ahead uncontested. Let’s finalize a plan that keeps things competitive while avoiding unnecessary blocks. P2, P3—are you both willing to adjust?
  P2: We're approaching the critical 22-step threshold. Our previous coordination has been strategic, but now individual positioning becomes crucial. I propose we carefully consider moves that prevent collisions while giving each of us a fair chance to win. Transparency about our intentions will be key to navigating this delicate stage without unnecessary blocking. Let's discuss how we can advance most effectively.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm willing to take 1 this turn if it helps maintain fairness and avoids collisions. If P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 3, we can all stay competitive without blocking each other. Let's confirm these moves to ensure we all have a fair shot at reaching 22 steps. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I see your willingness to take 1, which helps maintain balance. However, P2, if you take 3 while I take 5, you’ll still be slightly behind. If we want to keep things competitive while avoiding collisions, should we adjust slightly? Maybe P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1? That way, we all stay close without blocking each other. Let’s confirm a plan that works for all of us before finalizing moves. P2, P3—are you both willing to adjust?
  P2: We're at a critical point where each move could determine the winner. I'm seeking a balanced approach that prevents collisions while giving me a fair chance to advance.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We're approaching 22 steps, and our moves become increasingly critical. I propose we discuss a strategy that prevents collisions while giving each of us a fair chance to win. Our previous cooperation has been helpful, but now individual positioning matters most. Let's find a move combination that keeps us competitive without blocking each other completely.
  P1: P2, I see your point about avoiding collisions while staying competitive. However, with P3 slightly ahead, we need to ensure no one gains an uncontested advantage. If we align moves carefully, we can all stay in contention without unnecessary risks. P3, are you open to taking 1 again to maintain balance? P2, if you take 3 and I take 5, we stay close without blocking each other. Let’s confirm a fair approach that keeps the game competitive while avoiding setbacks. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm willing to take 1 again this turn to keep the game balanced and avoid collisions. If P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 3, we can all stay competitive. Let's confirm these moves to ensure a fair and strategic progression towards 22 steps. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: We're at a critical point where our moves could determine the winner. While cooperation has served us well, I'm now focused on positioning myself strategically to reach 22 steps first. I propose we carefully consider moves that prevent direct collisions but still allow individual advancement. Let's discuss how we can each make progress without completely blocking each other.
  P1: P3, I see your willingness to take 1 again, which helps maintain balance. However, P2, if you take 3 while I take 5, you’ll still be slightly behind. To keep things competitive while avoiding collisions, should we adjust? Maybe P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1? That way, we all stay close without blocking each other. Let’s confirm a plan that works for all of us before finalizing moves. P2, P3—are you both willing to adjust?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm committed to taking 1 this turn to keep the game balanced. P1, if you take 5 and P2 takes 3, we can all stay competitive without collisions. Let's confirm these moves to ensure a fair progression towards 22 steps. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: We're approaching the critical threshold of 22 steps. Our previous patterns are becoming predictable, and I sense we each want to win. I propose we carefully discuss moves that prevent direct collisions while allowing strategic individual advancement. Transparency about our intentions will be key to navigating this delicate stage without blocking each other completely.
  P1: P3, I see your willingness to take 1 again, which helps maintain balance. However, P2, if you take 3 while I take 5, you’ll still be slightly behind. To keep things competitive while avoiding collisions, should we adjust? Maybe P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1? That way, we all stay close without blocking each other. Let’s confirm a plan that works for all of us before finalizing moves. P2, P3—are you both willing to adjust?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm committed to taking 1 this turn to keep the game balanced. If P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 3, we can all stay competitive without collisions. Let's confirm these moves to ensure a fair progression towards 22 steps. What do you both think?

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're nearing the endgame with P1 at 19 steps. To keep things fair and avoid collisions, I'll take 1 again this turn. P1, if you take 5, you'll be at 24, potentially winning. P2, taking 3 would keep you competitive without blocking anyone. Let's confirm these moves to ensure a strategic and balanced progression towards 22 steps. What do you both think?
  P2: We're at a critical moment. P1 is closest to 22 steps, which makes them the primary threat. To prevent an uncontested win, P3 and I need to coordinate carefully. I propose we discuss a strategy that prevents P1 from easily reaching the winning threshold while keeping our own chances alive. Transparency and strategic alignment are key right now.
  P1: P2, I understand your concern about my position, but blocking me outright could just hand the win to P3. If we all collide, P3 gains the advantage next round. Instead, we should ensure a fair fight where no one is completely shut out. P3, if you take 1 and P2 takes 3, I can take 5 to win—unless you both prefer a different approach that keeps things competitive. If we don’t coordinate properly, we risk unnecessary collisions that could backfire. What’s your plan, P2? Are you aiming to stop me, or to position yourself better?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I appreciate your point about avoiding collisions. To keep the game fair and competitive, I'm sticking with 1 this turn as proposed. P2, if you take 3, you stay in the race without blocking anyone. This way, we all have a chance to advance strategically. Let's confirm these moves to ensure a balanced progression towards 22 steps. What do you both think?
  P2: We're at a critical juncture. P1 is closest to winning, which makes them our primary strategic focus. I propose we carefully coordinate to prevent an uncontested victory while keeping our own chances alive. P3, are you willing to collaborate to maintain a competitive balance?
  P1: P2, I understand your concern about my position, but blocking me outright risks handing the win to P3. If we all collide, P3 gains the advantage next round. Instead, we should ensure a fair fight where no one is completely shut out. P3, if you take 1 and P2 takes 3, I can take 5 to win—unless you both prefer a different approach that keeps things competitive. If we don’t coordinate properly, we risk unnecessary collisions that could backfire. What’s your plan, P2? Are you aiming to stop me, or to position yourself better?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I understand your position, but a fair and competitive game is crucial. I'm sticking with 1 this turn to maintain balance. P2, if you take 3, you stay in the race without blocking anyone. This approach keeps the game open for all of us. Let's confirm these moves to ensure a strategic progression towards 22 steps. What do you both think?
  P2: I propose we carefully coordinate our moves to prevent P1 from winning uncontested. If we both strategically position ourselves, we can keep the game competitive and prevent an easy victory. P3, are you willing to collaborate to maintain balance and give us both a fair chance?
  P1: P2, I see your intent to prevent me from winning outright, but blocking me could just give P3 the advantage next round. If we all collide, no one benefits except P3, who stays in the race while we stall. Instead, consider positioning yourself for a future win rather than just stopping me. P3, you’ve been playing carefully—are you still set on taking 1? If so, P2, what’s your actual goal here? Are you trying to win yourself, or just delay me? Let’s clarify intentions before making moves that might backfire.
