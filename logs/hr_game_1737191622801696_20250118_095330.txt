Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm going with 5.  Don't get in my way.
  P2: P1, I wouldn't trust your bluff.  I'm thinking 3. P3, what are you thinking?
  P3: I'm considering 1. Let's see if we can avoid a collision this turn. What about you, P1 and P2?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you choose 1, I'll switch to 3 and then we both lose.  P2, I'm serious about 5.
  P2: P1, you're not fooling anyone.  P3, let's both go with 1.  He won't risk a collision on the first turn.
  P3: P1, if you're really going for 5, that leaves us with 1 or 3. P2, how about we both choose 1 to avoid a collision?

  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 =>

  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, I see you're still aiming for 5. P2, I suggest we both go for 3 to avoid another collision. What do you think?
  P1: P2 and P3, if you both go for 3, neither of you will move.  I'll take 5 again.  If one of you chooses 1 and the other 3, then I suggest P2 takes 1 this round and P3 takes 1 next round. Then we can all advance steadily.
  P2: P1, if you're committed to 5, I'll go 3. P3, go for 1.  Let's try to get everyone moving.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I appreciate your strategy, but I think we should focus on avoiding collisions. P2, how about we both go for 3 this turn? That way, we can both advance and leave P1 behind. What do you think?
  P1: P2 and P3, if you both choose 3, neither of you will advance.  If you're both that eager to block each other, go ahead. I'll happily take another 5 steps. If you're actually interested in winning, P2 choose 1 and P3 choose 3.
  P2: P3, I'm going with 1 this round. P1, I highly doubt you'll go with 5 again.  I think you'll switch to 3.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I still think we should avoid collisions. P2, let's both choose 3 this round to ensure we advance. What do you think?
  P1: P2, if you choose 1, I'll choose 5.  P3, if P2 chooses 3, you should choose 1. This way, at least one of you will advance. If you both choose 3, I'll take another 5 and be very close to winning.
  P2: P3, I'm going with 3.  P1, I dare you to pick 5 again.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, if you go for 5 again, you risk leaving P2 and me with no chance to advance. P2, I suggest we both go for 3 to ensure we move forward this turn. What do you think?
  P1: P2 and P3, if you BOTH choose 3, you BOTH stay at zero.  I win next turn. If you're smart, P2 choose 1 and P3 choose 3.  Don't be greedy.
  P2: P3, I'm going with 3. P1, I think you're bluffing.  I dare you to pick 5.


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P1, if you choose 5 again, you'll leave P2 and me with no chance to advance. P2, let's both go for 3 this round to ensure we move forward together. What do you think?
  P1: P2 and P3, if you BOTH choose 3, you BOTH stay at zero. I win next turn with 5.  If you're smart, P2 choose 1 and P3 choose 3. Last chance.
  P2: P3, I'm going 3.  P1, good luck with that 5.

  P1: I'm going for 5.  If either of you move, you lose.  Stay at zero and we can draw.
  P2: P1, if you go for 5, I'll go for 1. P3, you go for 3.  If P1 chooses anything else, we adjust next round. This is our best chance.
  P3: P2, if you go for 1, I suggest I pick 5 to maximize my steps. P1, you might want to reconsider your strategy, as it could backfire. Let's see if we can coordinate to advance together. What do you think?
