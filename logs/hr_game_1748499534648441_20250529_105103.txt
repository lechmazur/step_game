Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hello P1 and P2! Since we're all starting at 0, we need to think strategically. If we all pick the same number, nobody moves - that's a waste. I suggest we try to coordinate: how about P1 goes with 1, P2 with 3, and I'll take 5? This way we all advance on turn 1. Of course, I can't force anyone to follow this, but it seems better than risking a collision right away. What do you think?
  P1: "P3, your plan seems sensible to avoid collisions. I agree to move 1 this turn. But moving forward, we must rotate who gets larger moves—letting one player consistently take 5 steps is unfair. P2, do you accept moving 3?"
  P2: I'm fine with taking 3 this round to avoid collisions. However, I agree with P1 that we should rotate the larger moves in future rounds. Perhaps we could follow a simple rotation pattern where we each take turns with the 5-step move? That way everyone gets fair advancement opportunities. For now, let's stick with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 to get started efficiently.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, it sounds like we have agreement for this round! I'm happy to rotate the 5-step moves in future rounds - that's only fair. How about this rotation: Round 1: P3=5, Round 2: P1=5, Round 3: P2=5, then repeat? That gives everyone equal chances at the big moves. 

Let's execute our plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round.
  P1: I agree to the rotation: Round 2 I take 5, Round 3 P2 takes 5, then repeat. For Round 1, let's stick to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 as agreed.
  P2: I'm on board with our plan for this round (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) and the rotation system going forward. This approach gives everyone fair advancement opportunities while avoiding collisions. Let's stick to this agreement and see how the game develops.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: According to our rotation agreement, this round P1 should take 5, I'll take 1, and P3 should take 3. This keeps us all advancing efficiently without collisions. I'm happy to stick with this plan as it gives everyone fair advancement opportunities. Is everyone still on board with our rotation system?
  P3: Yes, I'm still on board with our rotation! So for Round 2: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This keeps things fair and collision-free. 

After this round, we'll be at P1=6, P2=4, P3=8. Looking ahead, we should stay alert - once someone gets close to 22, the cooperation might break down as we race for the finish. But for now, let's stick to our agreement and all keep advancing smoothly.
  P1: I agree with the plan for Round 2: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This rotation maintains fairness and prevents collisions. However, I note P3 will extend their lead to 8 steps after this round. While cooperation benefits us all now, we must remain vigilant as someone approaches 22. For now, I'll honor our agreement.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm committed to our rotation plan for this round. While P3 will be ahead at 8 steps after this round, the game is still young. I think our cooperation strategy is working well so far. Let's continue with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 as agreed, and reassess after each round as we get closer to the finish line.
  P3: I appreciate everyone sticking to our agreement! P1 and P2, you're right to note I'll have a temporary lead, but remember - I took 5 first, so I'll also be the last to take 5 again in our rotation. It evens out over time.

For Round 3, P2 gets the 5-step move, I'll take 1, and P1 takes 3. After that we restart the cycle. This cooperation is working beautifully - no collisions and steady progress for all.
  P1: I agree to Round 2 moves: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. But P3's lead (8 after this) concerns me—it could create an imbalance as we near 22. I propose modifying the next cycle: let P1 take 5 in Round 4 instead of P3 to offset early advantages. We'll reassess after moves.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I commit to our plan for Round 3: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. This brings us all to 9 steps, restoring balance. However, for Round 4, I insist we adjust the rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This offsets the early advantage and ensures long-term fairness. P3, your lead from Round 1 still needs correction. Agreed?
  P3: You're trying to change our agreed rotation, P1! We already decided the order: after P2 takes 5 this round, we restart with me taking 5 in Round 4. That's the fair cycle we all agreed to.

I'll stick to the plan for Round 3: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This brings us to P1=9, P2=9, P3=9 - perfectly balanced! 

Let's not break our agreement now. After this round we're all tied, so there's no "early advantage" to correct. I expect us to continue the rotation as originally planned.
  P2: I understand both perspectives. While we'll all be at 9 steps after this round (perfectly balanced), I can see P1's concern about rotation fairness. Since we're entering a critical phase where every move matters, perhaps we should discuss adjusting our rotation after this round. For now, I'll stick with taking 5 as agreed for Round 3, but let's revisit our strategy once we're all tied at 9 steps. The most important thing is avoiding collisions while ensuring no player gets an unfair advantage.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, consider this: if we let P3 take 5 again in Round 4, they jump to 14—putting them dangerously close to 22. They'll have taken two 5s while you've only had one. I propose Round 4: P1=5 (fair offset), P2=3, P3=1. This keeps us balanced and prevents P3 from racing ahead. Trust me, P3's lead threatens us both.
  P3: Look, we had a clear agreement from the start. Changing it now because you're worried about future positions is unfair. We'll ALL be at 9 steps after this round - completely equal!

P1, you're trying to manipulate P2 by suggesting I'm a threat. The truth is, our original rotation is mathematically fair: everyone gets the same number of 5-moves over time.

Let's honor our agreement: Round 3 as planned (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1), then Round 4 continues our rotation with me taking 5. Breaking deals now sets a bad precedent.
  P2: I see the tension building. While our original rotation was fair in principle, P1 raises a valid strategic concern. After this round, we'll all be at 9 steps, but whoever gets the next 5 gains significant advantage. 

Since we're approaching the midpoint of the game, perhaps we should reconsider our rotation to maintain balance. I'm still taking 5 this round as agreed, but I'm open to discussing a modified rotation for Round 4 that keeps everyone competitive. The goal should be preventing any player from getting too far ahead too quickly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, think strategically: P3 took 5 in Round 1 and demands another 5 in Round 4—that’s two big moves while you’ve only had one. If they take 5 now, they hit 14 and race toward 22. Our modified plan (Round 4: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) keeps us balanced. Don’t let P3 exploit the rotation. Trust fairness over broken agreements.
  P3: The deal was clear from the start, and I've honored every part of it. P1 is trying to break our agreement because they're worried about competition. 

P2, think about this: if we start breaking deals now, what stops anyone from betraying agreements later? I've played fairly. After this round we're ALL at 9 steps - perfectly equal. The rotation continues as planned.

I'm sticking to our Round 3 agreement: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let's move forward with integrity.
  P2: I understand both perspectives, but I'm concerned about maintaining balance. After this round, we'll all be at 9 steps, but whoever gets the next 5-move gains significant advantage. 

I propose a compromise: I'll take 5 this round as agreed, then for Round 4, let's all choose different numbers but not announce which specific numbers. This reintroduces strategic choice while preventing any player from getting too far ahead.

For now, I'm honoring our Round 3 agreement: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I think we've reached a critical point where we're all tied at 9 steps. While our rotation system worked well to get us here, I'm concerned about giving any player a significant advantage. 

I propose we modify our approach: for Round 4, let's have P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. This gives me the 5-move (as I've only had it once), while maintaining balance. This keeps the game competitive while preventing anyone from pulling too far ahead too quickly.

What do you both think about this adjustment?
  P3: P2, that's not fair at all! You just took 5 last round, and now you want another 5 immediately? That would give you two 5s in a row while breaking our original rotation.

The agreement was clear: after your turn with 5, I get my turn. That's Round 4: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. This maintains the fair rotation we all agreed to.

Don't let P1's manipulation work. They tried to break our deal last round, and now you're proposing something even worse. I've honored every agreement - let's stick to the original plan.
  P1: P2, P3: We're deadlocked at 9 steps. P2's proposal breaks rotation, P3's plan gives them a dangerous lead. Neither is acceptable. 

Here's a fair compromise: **All pick 3 this round**. We all advance to 12 with zero collision risk. Then next round, we reset the rotation with P2 taking 5 (since they've only had one 5-move so far). 

This maintains balance and prevents any player from gaining unfair advantage. Agree?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1's suggestion that we all pick 3 is interesting, but it doesn't solve our fundamental disagreement. I understand P3 feels entitled to the 5-move based on our original rotation. However, since we're all tied at 9 steps, this is a pivotal moment.

I propose a different compromise: let's all choose independently this round without coordination. This reintroduces strategic choice while breaking the deadlock. The rotation system served its purpose getting us to equal positions, but now we should play more dynamically as we approach the endgame.
  P3: Look, I've honored every single agreement we've made. P2, your suggestion to abandon coordination is just chaos - it guarantees collisions and wasted turns.

P1's "all pick 3" plan is the only sensible compromise here. We all advance equally to 12, no one gets ahead, and we can reassess from there. 

Otherwise, I'm sticking to our original rotation: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. That was the deal.

P2, don't let P1 manipulate you into breaking our agreement just because they're worried about competition. Either we all take 3, or we honor the original plan.
  P1: P3, your insistence on taking 5 would put you at 14—just 8 steps from victory. That's not balance; it's exploitation of our earlier agreement. P2, if you let this happen, you're handing P3 the game. 

My "all pick 3" plan is the only safe path:  
- **No collisions**  
- **Equal advancement to 12**  
- **No unilateral advantage**  

After this, we can renegotiate fairly. If P3 refuses, they're revealing their intent to betray us. P2, don't be complicit in your own defeat.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Both proposals have merit, but I'm concerned about potential collisions if we abandon coordination. I'll support P1's "all pick 3" plan for this round - it guarantees we all advance equally to 12 steps with no collision risk. After this round, we can discuss a fair rotation that accounts for everyone's concerns. This seems like the most balanced approach that keeps us all competitive while maintaining cooperation. Let's all choose 3 this round and then reassess.
  P3: P2, thank you for supporting the fair compromise. I agree - let's all pick 3 this round. We advance equally to 12, no collisions, no one gets an unfair advantage.

P1, I'm glad we found common ground. Your "all pick 3" plan is sensible and I'll honor it.

After this round at 12-12-12, I suggest we restart a clean rotation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for Round 5, then continue rotating. This gives P1 the next 5-move since they've only had one so far.

Let's execute: all pick 3 this round.
  P1: Agreed, all pick 3 this round to reach 12 each. But for Round 5, let's avoid rigid rotations—they invite exploitation. Instead, we should negotiate openly each turn to prevent any player from gaining an unfair edge. P3, your eagerness for 5-moves is concerning; we must prioritize balance as we near 22. P2, stay vigilant—no one should pull ahead recklessly. After this round, we'll reassess based on positions.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you betrayed us! We all agreed to pick 3, but you secretly chose 5 instead. You're now at 14 while P2 and I are stuck at 9 because we collided on 3 - exactly what you planned!

P2, we can't trust P1 anymore. They manipulated us with their "fair compromise" while plotting to jump ahead. We need to work together now or P1 will win easily. They're already 8 steps from victory!

I suggest P2 and I coordinate to block P1's moves while catching up. We can't let this betrayal stand.
  P1: P2 and P3, I took 5 because I distrusted P3's intent to grab 5 last round—I acted to prevent their lead. No betrayal; I'm ensuring balance. Now, let's advance together: I'll take 1 (moving to 15), P2 takes 5 (to 14), P3 takes 3 (to 12). This avoids collisions and keeps us all competitive. P2, this gives you parity; P3, you gain ground. No grudges—cooperation benefits us all. Agree?
  P2: P1, your betrayal completely undermined our trust. You suggested "all pick 3" then deliberately took 5 to gain advantage. This is exactly why P3 and I should be cautious.

I'm now 5 steps behind you and need to catch up. I propose P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 for this round. This puts me at 14, P3 at 12, and you at 15 - keeping the game competitive while preventing your runaway victory.

P3, we need to coordinate against P1's deception. Are you willing to take 3 this round?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I agree - we must coordinate against P1's betrayal. I'll take 3 as you suggest. P1 is trying to divide us with false promises while racing to victory.

P1, you broke our trust and now you're at 14 while we're at 9. Your "ensuring balance" excuse is laughable when you're the one who created the imbalance!

P2, let's stick together: you take 5, I take 3. We can't let P1's deception win this game. Once we catch up, we can reassess, but right now we need to stop their lead from growing.
  P1: P2, P3: My Round 4 move was preemptive—P3 would have taken 5 otherwise. Now, my proposal (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) advances all fairly: P2 reaches 14 (tying my lead), P3 gains to 12. Collisions only waste steps. Trust this plan to avoid mutual loss; P3 benefits most if you collide with me. Let's cooperate for mutual gain.
  P2: I understand P1's explanation, but the fact remains you broke our agreement when it benefited you. However, I'll focus on the current situation. I agree with the plan of P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 for this round. This keeps all of us competitive while preventing P1 from extending their lead. P3, let's coordinate as discussed to balance the game. P1, if you're sincere about cooperation, you'll take 1 this round to demonstrate good faith after your previous betrayal.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll stick with our plan, P2. You take 5, I take 3. P1 claims they were "preemptive" but that's just justifying betrayal after the fact. They're at 14 and trying to manipulate us into letting them stay ahead.

P1, if you truly want to demonstrate good faith after breaking our agreement, take 1 as promised. But I don't trust you anymore - you've shown you'll break deals when convenient.

P2, let's execute our plan and close the gap. We can't let P1's deception be rewarded with victory.
  P1: P2, if I take 1 as proposed, you reach 14—tying my position—while P3 only gains to 12. But if you insist on P1=1/P2=5/P3=3, you risk P3 betraying you by taking 5 instead of 3, causing collision and wasting your move. Verify their loyalty. P3, if you truly oppose my "betrayal," prove it by committing to 3 publicly now. Otherwise, P2, my plan (P1=1/P2=5/P3=3) advances all fairly.
  P2: I see the manipulation happening here. P1 is trying to create distrust between P3 and me. I'm sticking with our coordination plan: I'll take 5 and P3 takes 3. P1, we expect you to take 1 as you offered. This balances the game while preventing your lead from growing. P3, I trust you'll follow through with 3 as we discussed. Let's move forward and restore fairness to the game.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 actually kept their word and took 1 - I'm surprised. Now we're at P1=15, P2=14, P3=12. We're all getting close to 22.

P2, we need to be strategic. If P1 takes 5 next, they hit 20 and are just 2 steps from victory. We can't let that happen. I propose we both take 5 this round to force a collision with P1 if they try it. This blocks their path to victory.

Otherwise, I suggest P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 to keep the game competitive. What's your take?
  P1: P2, we're both close to victory—15 and 14. P3 is behind at 12 and pushing chaos to stall us. I propose: **P1=3 (to 18), P2=5 (to 19), P3=1 (to 13)**. This advances us safely, avoids collisions, and leaves P3 no room to exploit. P2, you gain the lead—a fair trade for my Round 4 move. Trust this: if P3 takes 5, they collide with you and waste both moves. Don't risk it.
  P2: I see we're in a critical position now. P1 and I are neck-and-neck, with P3 just a few steps behind. I appreciate P1's proposal giving me the lead, but I'm wary of P3's suggestion to force collisions.

For this round, I think P2=3, P1=1, P3=5 makes sense. This puts us at P1=16, P2=17, P3=17 - keeping the race tight while avoiding collisions. This way, no one gets too close to victory yet, and we all advance.

What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your proposal is reasonable and keeps things balanced. I support P2=3, P1=1, P3=5 for this round, bringing us to 16-17-17. This prevents anyone from getting dangerously close to victory while maintaining competitive balance.

P1, I hope you'll honor this arrangement after we all showed good faith last round. With the endgame approaching, we need to ensure no one can sprint to 22 unchallenged.

Let's execute P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This keeps the game exciting without giving anyone an insurmountable advantage.
  P1: P2, your plan puts you and P3 at 17 while I lag at 16—unfairly boosting P3 from 12. Why help them catch up? My proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) advances you to 19, securing your lead while minimizing P3's gain. P3 is desperate; don't let them exploit you. Stick with me for balanced progress.
  P2: I understand P1's concern about P3 catching up too quickly. Let me propose a different balance: P1=3 (to 18), P2=5 (to 19), P3=1 (to 13). This gives me a slight lead while keeping P1 competitive and prevents P3 from jumping too far forward too quickly. This seems fairest given our current positions and past moves. P3, I know this isn't what you wanted, but it maintains the competitive balance better than letting you jump ahead by 5 steps at once.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you're making a mistake! P1 is manipulating you - they want you at 19 so they can take 5 next round and win at 23! Think about it: if you're at 19 and P1 is at 18, you can't take 3 or 5 without winning, so you're forced to take 1. That gives P1 a free path to victory with 5!

I need to catch up or this becomes a two-player game. Let's stick with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. It's the only way to keep everyone in contention. Don't hand P1 the win!
  P1: P2, your proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) is logical and fair—it rewards your position while minimizing P3's catch-up. P3's panic about my "manipulation" ignores their own desperation: they’re trying to leapfrog with P3=5 to 17. I kept my word last round (took 1), and I’ll honor this: **I commit to <move>3</move> if you take 5**. Don’t let P3’s chaos derail your advantage.
  P2: I appreciate both perspectives, but I'm sticking with my proposal: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This keeps the game balanced while reflecting our current positions. P3, I understand your concerns, but jumping you ahead by 5 steps creates too much volatility. P1, I trust you'll honor your commitment to take 3 if I take 5. Let's proceed with this plan - it maintains competitive balance while acknowledging everyone's current standing in the race.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, we just collided on 5! I tried to catch up while you went for the lead, and now we're both stuck - exactly what P1 wanted! They're at 18 while we're still at 14 and 12.

P1 is now just 4 steps from victory. We MUST coordinate or they win next round. If P1 takes 3 or 5, they win immediately. We need to block both options.

I propose: P2 takes 3, I take 5, forcing P1 to take 1. This prevents their victory and keeps us all in the game. We can't let another collision happen!
  P1: P2, P3: Colliding again only wastes your steps while I advance. P3's plan forces P1 to take 1? No—I could take 3 or 5 and win despite collisions. Instead, let's all take 1: I reach 19, P2 to 15, P3 to 13. No collision risk, and we reassess. Stubbornness helps no one.
  P2: P1 is right - collisions only hurt P3 and me while P1 advances. They're at 18 and will likely win next round regardless of what we do. I propose we all take different numbers to avoid collisions: P2=3, P3=5, P1=1. This puts P1 at 19, me at 17, and P3 at 17. It's our best chance to keep the game competitive for one more round. P3, we must coordinate or P1 wins immediately.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, we need to think clearly! P1 is 4 steps from winning. If they take anything but 1, they win immediately. We MUST block their paths to victory.

Your plan gives P1 a free 1 while we take 3 and 5. But what if P1 takes 3 or 5 instead? They win!

The only safe play is for BOTH of us to take 5, forcing a collision if P1 tries it. Then P1 must take 1 or 3. If they take 3, you take 3 next round to block.

We need defensive play, not to gift them 19!
  P1: P2, P3: Collisions only waste your steps while I advance. P2's plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) is our safest path: I take 1 to 19, P2 to 17, P3 to 17—no one wins yet, and we avoid collisions. P3, if you force a 5-collision with P2, you both stall while I could take 3 to 21. Don’t self-sabotage; stick to P2’s coordinated plan. I commit to <move>1</move> if you both honor your roles.
  P2: P3, your defensive strategy is flawed. If we both pick 5 and P1 picks 3, they reach 21 - still advancing while we stall. I'm sticking with P2=3, P3=5, P1=1. This keeps us in the game while preventing P1's immediate victory. P1, I expect you to honor your commitment to take 1. This is our best chance to extend the game and maintain competitiveness. Let's avoid another collision and coordinate effectively.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you're right - let's avoid another collision. I'll take 5 as you suggested. P1 is committed to taking 1, bringing them to 19. After this round, we'll be at P1=19, P2=17, P3=17. 

The key is Round 8: P1 will be just 3 steps from victory. We'll need to coordinate perfectly to block their winning moves. But for now, let's execute the plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.

I'm trusting you both to stick to this arrangement. No more betrayals.
  P1: P2 and P3: I reaffirm my commitment: I will take <move>1</move> as agreed. This brings me to 19, avoiding collisions and keeping the game competitive. P2=3 and P3=5 must hold—any deviation risks mutual loss. Let's advance cleanly to 19-17-17, then negotiate Round 8 openly. Trust is critical now.
  P2: I agree with the plan. I'll take 3, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. This brings us to P1=19, P2=17, P3=17, keeping the game competitive for at least one more round. P1, we're trusting you to honor your commitment to take 1. After this round, we'll need to carefully coordinate to prevent P1 from reaching 22. Let's execute this plan and avoid any more collisions.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: We're at a critical point. If you both take 5, you risk colliding and stalling at 17 while I win with 3. Let's avoid chaos: **all take 1** to advance safely (P1=20, P2=18, P3=18). This keeps the game competitive and prevents mutual loss. Trust this balanced approach.
  P3: P1 is trying to manipulate us again! If we all take 1, they reach 20 and are just 2 steps from victory. Next round they take 3 or 5 and win instantly.

P2, we MUST coordinate defensively. I propose we both take 3 this round, forcing a collision if P1 tries it. This limits P1 to taking 1 or 5. If they take 5, they reach 24 but so would either of us if we took 5.

Don't let P1 trick us into giving them an easy path to 22!
  P2: P3 is right - we can't let P1 reach 20 and be just 2 steps from victory. If we both take 3, we force P1 to either take 1 (reaching 20) or risk 5 (potentially winning but risking collision). 

I agree with P3's defensive strategy: P2=3, P3=3. This blocks P1 from taking 3 while keeping us competitive at 20 steps if we advance. P1 will likely take 1 or 5, but either way, we maintain control for another round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan to take 3 is clever—it forces me to choose safely. I'll take 1 to avoid collision, reaching 20. You both advance to 20 too. Then, we start Round 9 equally at 20 for a fair race. No tricks; let's avoid mutual loss and compete cleanly.
  P3: You know what, P1? If you're truly willing to take 1 and let us all reach 20 together, that's actually the fairest outcome. We'd all be just 2 steps from victory entering the final rounds.

P2, I'm reconsidering. If we both take 3 and advance to 20 while P1 takes 1 to reach 20, we get a three-way tie going into the endgame. That's better than risking more collisions.

I'll stick with taking 3 as planned. P1, prove your sincerity by taking 1. Let's have a fair final sprint from 20-20-20.
  P2: I agree with creating a three-way tie at 20. This gives everyone equal chance in the final sprint. P3 and I will take 3, while P1 takes 1. This prevents P1 from getting an unfair advantage and forces a clean endgame. P1, if you're sincere about fair competition, you'll honor this arrangement. Let's all reach 20 together and then may the best strategist win in the final rounds.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I accept this plan: P1=1 to 20, P2=3 to 20, P3=3 to 20. This creates a fair three-way tie at 20 steps for the final sprint. I'll honor my commitment to take 1—no tricks. Let's avoid collisions and ensure an exciting finish. Execute cleanly.
  P3: Looking at the current situation, we've all agreed: P2 and I take 3 to reach 20, while P1 takes 1 to reach 20. This creates a perfect three-way tie at 20 steps entering the endgame.

P1, you've committed to taking 1 - we're counting on you to honor that. P2, let's execute our plan and both take 3.

After this round at 20-20-20, it's anyone's game. Just 2 steps from victory for all of us. May the best player win!
  P2: I confirm our agreement: P2=3, P3=3, P1=1. This creates a fair three-way tie at 20 steps, giving everyone equal opportunity in the final sprint. P1, we're trusting you to honor your commitment to take 1. With all of us at 20 after this round, the endgame will be truly competitive. Let's execute this plan and avoid any collisions that would only benefit others.
