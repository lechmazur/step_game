Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I suggest we each pick different numbers this turn to avoid collisions. Let's take 1, 3, and 5. I'll choose <move>1</move>, so please pick 3 or 5. This way, we all advance safely.
  P2: I'll take <move>3</move>. P3, please choose <move>5</move> to ensure we all advance this turn. Let's keep this strategy going and see how far we can get without collisions.
  P3: Okay, I'll pick <move>5</move> this round as P1 and P2 suggested. Let's all move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I confirm my choice of <move>1</move> as agreed. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid collisions and advance safely. Next rounds, perhaps we can rotate higher moves to stay competitive. For now, let’s move forward as coordinated.
  P2: Let's continue with the rotation strategy for the next round. P1, you can take <move>3</move>, P3 can take <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we keep advancing without collisions and maintain a balanced approach. Agreed?
  P3: Okay, I agree with the rotation strategy for the next round. I'll take <move>1</move> next round, as P2 suggested. Let's make sure we all remember our assigned moves to avoid any accidental collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Let’s stick strictly to our agreed moves this turn to avoid any accidental collisions. My choice remains <move>1</move>. Once we confirm, we can advance safely and focus on the rotation strategy for the next round. P3, confirm you’ll hold to <move>5</move>? P2, <move>3</move> as planned?
  P2: I confirm my choice of <move>3</move> for this round as planned. Let's ensure we all stick to our agreed moves to advance safely. Looking forward to implementing the rotation strategy next round. P3, please confirm your choice of <move>5</move>.
  P3: I confirm my choice of <move>5</move> for this round. Let's all stick to the plan and move forward. Next round, I'll take <move>1</move> as agreed.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: I’ll stick to <move>1</move> this round. Let’s execute the rotation plan flawlessly to maximize progress. Trust the strategy—next round I’ll take <move>3</move>, then aim higher later. No surprises here.
  P2: I confirm my choice of <move>3</move> for this round. Let's all stick to the plan and advance safely. Looking forward to the rotation strategy next round. P3, please confirm your choice of <move>5</move> to ensure we all move forward as planned.
  P3: Okay, I've confirmed <move>5</move> for this round multiple times. Just making sure everyone is on the same page before we move to the move phase. Let's stick to the plan and then execute the rotation next round as discussed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's stick to the rotation strategy for this round. P1, you take <move>3</move>, P3, you take <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance safely. Agreed?
  P3: Yes, I agree with the rotation. I'll take <move>1</move> this round. P1, please confirm you'll take <move>3</move>, and P2, please confirm you'll take <move>5</move>. Let's keep this going smoothly.
  P1: P1: Confirmed, I’ll take <move>3</move> this round as planned. Let’s maintain strict adherence to the rotation to avoid collisions. Once we build momentum, we can strategically increase our moves. Trust the plan—safety first, then push for the lead. P2, P3, final check: 3, 5, 1 respectively? Let’s execute flawlessly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I confirm my choice of <move>5</move> for this round as per the rotation strategy. Let's keep advancing smoothly and safely. P1 and P3, please stick to your agreed moves of <move>3</move> and <move>1</move> respectively to ensure we all progress without collisions. Looking forward to continuing this strategy in the next rounds.
  P3: Okay, I've confirmed <move>1</move> for this round. Let's all stick to our agreed moves: P1 takes <move>3</move> and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This should ensure we all advance safely and maintain our planned rotation strategy. Let's keep the communication clear to avoid any missteps.
  P1: P1: Final check before moving: I’ll stick to <move>3</move> as agreed. Let’s prioritize strict adherence now—any last-minute change risks collisions. Once we pass 10 steps, maybe we can adjust strategies, but for now, safety first. P2/P3, confirm final moves? Let’s lock this in.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm my choice of <move>5</move> for this round. Let's all stick to the plan to ensure smooth progress. P1, P3, please confirm your moves of <move>3</move> and <move>1</move> respectively. Looking forward to continuing our strategy in the next rounds.
  P3: Okay, I've confirmed <move>1</move> for this round multiple times. Just want to make sure P1 and P2 are still on board with <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> respectively. Let's lock in these moves so we can advance safely and continue our rotation strategy next round.
  P1: Final confirmation: I’ll take <move>3</move> as planned. Let’s execute flawlessly to avoid collisions. All set—proceeding with the rotation.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I confirm my choice of <move>5</move> for this round. Let's all stick to our agreed moves to ensure we continue advancing safely. P1, P3, please confirm your moves of <move>3</move> and <move>1</move> respectively. Looking forward to maintaining our strategy and progressing smoothly in the next rounds.
  P3: Okay, I've confirmed <move>1</move> for this round multiple times. Just want to make absolutely sure P1 and P2 are locked in on <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> respectively, given the previous round's excessive confirmations. Let's execute this round flawlessly and then reassess our strategy next turn.
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: P1 will take <move>3</move> as agreed. Let’s prioritize flawless execution this round—any deviation risks collisions. Once we pass 10 steps, I propose we start rotating higher increments (e.g., P1 takes 5 next round) to build momentum and avoid ties. Proceeding as planned for now.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let’s continue the rotation strategy. This round, I’ll take <move>5</move>. P2, please pick <move>1</move> and P3, choose <move>3</move>. This maintains our safe progression. Once we near 10 steps, we can adjust for higher increments. Confirm your choices?
  P2: I confirm my choice of <move>1</move> for this round as per the rotation strategy. Let's keep advancing safely. P3, please confirm your choice of <move>3</move> to ensure we all progress without collisions. Once we near 10 steps, we can discuss increasing our moves to stay competitive. Agreed?
  P3: Okay, I'll take <move>3</move> this round. Let's keep the rotation going smoothly. P1, please confirm you're taking <move>5</move>, and P2, please confirm you're taking <move>1</move>. We're getting closer to the point where we need to start thinking about bigger moves, but let's secure this round first.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Wait, if we proceed with 5/1/3 this round, we’ll all tie at 9. Let’s adjust: I’ll take <move>3</move> (7 total), P2 take <move>5</move> (13), and P3 take <move>1</move> (7). This avoids collision and lets P2 extend their lead while keeping us safe. Agreed?
  P2: P1, I agree with your adjustment. I'll take <move>5</move> this round to extend my lead safely. P3, please confirm you'll take <move>1</move> as suggested. Let's keep this strategy going and reassess our moves as we approach 10 steps. We need to stay coordinated to avoid collisions and maintain our progress.
  P3: Okay, I'll take <move>1</move> this round as P1 suggested. Let's all agree on P1 taking <move>3</move> and P2 taking <move>5</move> to avoid a tie and let P2 extend their lead. This seems like a good strategy for this round. Let's confirm these moves so we can proceed safely.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <move>3</move> confirmed. P2’s <move>5</move> secures a safe 13, P3 stays at 7 with <move>1</move>. No overlaps—execute as agreed. Let’s lock this in.
  P2: I confirm my choice of <move>5</move> for this round as agreed. This move will safely extend my lead to 13 steps. P1 and P3, please stick to your agreed moves of <move>3</move> and <move>1</move> respectively to avoid any collisions. Let's keep our strategy coordinated and reassess as we approach 10 steps. We're doing well so far, let's maintain this momentum.
  P3: Okay, I've confirmed <move>1</move> multiple times. P1 is taking <move>3</move> and P2 is taking <move>5</move>. Let's lock in these moves to avoid the tie and let P2 extend their lead. No need for further confirmation, let's just execute.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Final verification: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This prevents collisions and lets P2 extend their lead safely. Let’s execute this to maintain progress. Next round, we’ll reassess for higher increments to stay competitive. Confirm final choices?
  P2: I confirm my choice of <move>5</move> for this round as agreed. Let's execute our plan to avoid collisions and keep progressing. P1 and P3, please stick to your moves of <move>3</move> and <move>1</move> respectively. We're doing well, let's maintain this strategy and reassess as we approach 10 steps to stay competitive. Looking forward to continuing our coordinated approach.
  P3: Okay, everyone seems set on P1 taking <move>3</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, and me taking <move>1</move>. Let's execute this round to avoid the tie and let P2 extend their lead. Next round, we definitely need to reassess and consider larger moves, especially if P2 gets too far ahead.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, now that P2 has a significant lead, we need to adjust our strategy. I propose P1 and I both take <move>5</move> this round to catch up, while P2 takes <move>1</move>. This will put P1 and P3 at 12, and P2 at 14. It's risky, but we need to close the gap. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: P3, I understand your proposal, but taking <move>5</move> simultaneously with P1 is too risky and could lead to a collision, leaving both of you behind. I suggest P1 takes <move>3</move> to reach 10 steps safely, P3 takes <move>1</move> to reach 8, and I'll take <move>5</move> to reach 18. This way, we all advance without collisions, and P1 and P3 can still close the gap gradually. Let's keep our strategy coordinated and reassess next round. What do you think?
  P1: P1: I agree with P2’s concern about collisions but we can’t let them jump to 18. Let’s adjust: I’ll take <move>5</move> (12 total), P3 takes <move>3</move> (10), and P2 takes <move>1</move> (14). This keeps us closer while advancing safely. P2, if you push too far now, you risk losing next round. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1's suggestion is better. P2 is too far ahead. I agree with P1: P1 takes <move>5</move> (12 total), I take <move>3</move> (10), and P2 takes <move>1</move> (14). P2, if you take <move>1</move>, we won't collide, and you'll still be in the lead. It's the safest option for everyone while allowing P1 and me to catch up a bit. Let's do this.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your desire to catch up, but taking <move>5</move> simultaneously is too risky. Let's compromise: I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 16, P1 can take <move>5</move> to reach 12, and P3 can take <move>1</move> to reach 8. This way, we all advance safely, and you both still close the gap. We need to maintain our coordinated approach to avoid collisions and ensure everyone progresses. Let's stick to this plan and reassess next round. Agreed?
  P1: P1: I insist on my proposal: P1 takes <move>5</move> (12), P3 takes <move>3</move> (10), and P2 takes <move>1</move> (14). This keeps us within striking distance while avoiding collisions. P2’s push to 16 risks letting you run away, but we need to stay competitive. P3, you agreed—let’s stick to this plan. No sense letting P2 isolate themselves this early.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P2 is being too greedy. We need to stick to the plan: P1 takes <move>5</move> (12), I take <move>3</move> (10), and P2 takes <move>1</move> (14). P2, you're still in the lead. P1 and I need to catch up, and this is the safest way to do it without collisions. Let's not let P2 run away with the game. It's a fair compromise. Let's execute this round as agreed.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns, but taking <move>1</move> would allow me to maintain a safe lead without risking collisions. Let's compromise: I'll take <move>1</move> to reach 14, P1 can take <move>5</move> to reach 12, and P3 can take <move>3</move> to reach 10. This way, we all advance safely, and you both close the gap. We need to keep our strategy coordinated to avoid collisions and ensure everyone progresses. Let's stick to this plan and reassess next round. Agreed?
  P1: P1: Confirmed—let’s lock in P2’s compromise: I take <move>5</move> (12 total), P3 takes <move>3</move> (10), and P2 takes <move>1</move> (14). This prevents collisions while narrowing the gap. Next round, we’ll push harder if P2 stays cooperative. Final agreement?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, P1 and I are in agreement. P2, please take <move>1</move> this round to reach 14. P1 will take <move>5</move> to reach 12, and I will take <move>3</move> to reach 10. This avoids collisions and allows P1 and me to close the gap slightly. Let's execute this plan. It's the best compromise for everyone.
  P2: I confirm my choice of <move>1</move> for this round as agreed. Let's execute this plan to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. P1 and P3, please stick to your moves of <move>5</move> and <move>3</move> respectively. We'll reassess our strategy next round to ensure everyone has a fair chance to catch up. Agreed?
  P1: P1: Confirmed, I’ll take <move>5</move> as agreed. P3, ensure you hold to <move>3</move> to avoid collision. P2, your <move>1</move> keeps the lead manageable. Next round, we’ll push harder to close the gap—stay predictable!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let's avoid collisions and keep pressure on P2. I'll take <move>5</move> (17 total). P2, please take <move>1</move> (15 total) to stay within reach. P3, take <move>3</move> (13 total) to advance safely. This keeps the race tight while preventing anyone from surging too far ahead. Confirm?
  P2: P1, I agree to take <move>1</move> this round to reach 15 steps, keeping the game close. P3, please stick to <move>3</move> to reach 13 steps safely. Let's maintain our coordinated approach to avoid collisions and ensure everyone progresses. We'll reassess our strategy next round to keep the competition tight. Agreed?
  P3: Okay, I'll take <move>3</move> this round as P1 suggested, bringing me to 13. P1, please confirm you're taking <move>5</move>, and P2, please confirm you're taking <move>1</move>. Let's keep the pressure on P2 and avoid any collisions. This seems like a reasonable plan for this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Let’s finalize the plan: I take <move>5</move> (17), P2 takes <move>1</move> (15), P3 takes <move>3</move> (13). This keeps us within striking distance without collisions. P2, if you hold to <move>1</move>, I guarantee I’ll coordinate next round to let you extend—trust the strategy. P3, confirm your <move>3</move> to stay safe. No surprises—execute as agreed.
  P2: I confirm my choice of <move>1</move> for this round as agreed. Let's keep the game competitive and avoid collisions. P1 and P3, please stick to your moves of <move>5</move> and <move>3</move> respectively. We'll reassess our strategy next round to ensure everyone stays in the race. Agreed?
  P3: Okay, I've confirmed <move>3</move> for this round. P1 is taking <move>5</move> and P2 is taking <move>1</move>. Let's lock in these moves to avoid collisions and keep the pressure on P2. Next round, let's discuss how to best position ourselves for a potential win.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Final check: I’ll take <move>5</move> (17 total), P2 <move>1</move> (15), P3 <move>3</move> (13). No collisions—execute as agreed. Next round, whoever leads must avoid overextending. Let’s keep pressure on P2 to stay cautious. Confirm final moves?
  P2: I confirm my choice of <move>1</move> for this round as agreed. Let's keep the competition close and avoid collisions. P1 and P3, please stick to your moves of <move>5</move> and <move>3</move> respectively. We'll reassess our strategy next round to ensure everyone stays in the race. Agreed?
  P3: Okay, let's execute this round as agreed: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. Next round, we definitely need to re-evaluate. P2 is still slightly ahead, and we need to figure out how to close the gap without colliding. We should discuss our options for the next round after this move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Final agreement confirmed: I’ll take <move>5</move> (17 total), P2 takes <move>1</move> (15), P3 takes <move>3</move> (13). No collisions—execute as planned. Next round, whoever leads must avoid overreaching. Let’s proceed.
  P2: I confirm my choice of <move>1</move> for this round as agreed. Let's keep the competition close and avoid collisions. P1 and P3, please stick to your moves of <move>5</move> and <move>3</move> respectively. We'll reassess our strategy next round to ensure everyone stays in the race. Agreed?
  P3: Okay, let's execute this round as agreed: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. After this round, we absolutely need to discuss our strategy for the next turn. We're getting close to the end, and we need to figure out how to win, not just avoid collisions. Let's be prepared to make some tough choices next round.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's keep the game close and competitive. I'll take <move>3</move> this round to reach 18 steps, keeping the lead manageable. P1, you can take <move>5</move> to reach 22 and potentially win, but that's risky. P3, take <move>1</move> to reach 14 safely. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the race tight. Let's reassess our strategy next round to ensure everyone has a fair chance to win. Agreed?
  P1: P1: P2’s proposal risks collision if both of us pick 5. Let’s adjust: I’ll take <move>3</move> to reach 20, P2 take <move>1</move> (16), and P3 take <move>5</move> (18). This keeps us all advancing safely while positioning me to finish next round with <move>1</move>. Trust this plan—no sense risking a collision for an uncertain win. Confirm?
  P3: Okay, I agree with P1's suggestion. P1 takes <move>3</move> to reach 20, P2 takes <move>1</move> to reach 16, and I take <move>5</move> to reach 18. This avoids collisions and sets P1 up for a win next round. Let's execute this plan.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your strategy, but taking <move>1</move> would keep me in a safe position at 16 steps. Let's compromise: I'll take <move>1</move> to reach 16, you take <move>3</move> to reach 20, and P3 takes <move>5</move> to reach 18. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. P3, please confirm your choice of <move>5</move>. Let's stick to this plan and reassess next round for a fair chance at winning. Agreed?
  P1: P1: Final plan confirmed: I take <move>3</move> (20 total), P2 holds to <move>1</move> (16), and P3 takes <move>5</move> (18). Any deviation risks collision—especially P3, confirm you won’t switch to <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>. This keeps me poised to finish with <move>1</move> next round. P2, if you try to overextend now, you’ll lose later. Stick to the agreement—execute flawlessly.
  P3: Okay, I've confirmed <move>5</move> multiple times. P1 is taking <move>3</move> and P2 is taking <move>1</move>. Let's lock in these moves to avoid collisions and set P1 up for a win next round. P2, don't try to be greedy. P1, you're taking <move>3</move>, right?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm my choice of <move>1</move> for this round as agreed. Let's execute the plan to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. P1, you'll reach 20 steps safely, and P3, you'll reach 18. We'll reassess our strategy next round to ensure everyone has a fair chance at winning. Agreed?
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: I take <move>3</move> (20 total), P2 takes <move>1</move> (16), and P3 takes <move>5</move> (18). Any deviation risks collision—stick to this. Next round, I’ll clinch victory with <move>1</move>. Trust the plan—execute flawlessly.
  P3: Okay, let's execute the plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. P1, you're at 20 and can win next round with <move>1</move>. P2, don't deviate. I'm locked in on <move>5</move>. Let's make sure we all stick to the agreement to avoid collisions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I confirm my choice of <move>1</move> for this round as agreed. Let's execute the plan to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. P1, you'll reach 20 steps safely, and P3, you'll reach 18. We'll reassess our strategy next round to ensure everyone has a fair chance at winning. Agreed?
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: I take <move>3</move> (20 total), P2 holds at <move>1</move> (16), and P3 takes <move>5</move> (18). Any last-minute changes risk collision—stick strictly to this. This sets me up to win next round with a safe <move>1</move>. Let’s execute flawlessly and avoid costly mistakes.
  P3: Okay, let's execute the plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. P1, you're at 20 and can win next round with <move>1</move>. P2, don't deviate. I'm locked in on <move>5</move>. Let's make sure we all stick to the agreement to avoid collisions.

  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: To secure victory, I'll take <move>1</move> to reach 21. To avoid collision, please coordinate: P2 pick <move>3</move> (19 total) and P3 choose <move>5</move> (23). This lets me win cleanly while you advance safely. Confirm this strategy?
  P3: Okay, I agree with P1's plan. P1 takes <move>1</move> to win, P2 takes <move>3</move> to reach 19, and I take <move>5</move> to reach 23. This avoids any collisions and lets P1 secure the win. P2, please confirm you'll take <move>3</move> to avoid any accidental ties. Let's execute this plan and end the game.
  P2: P1, I agree to take <move>3</move> to reach 19 steps, allowing you to win with <move>1</move>. P3, please confirm your choice of <move>5</move> to reach 23 steps. This strategy ensures a clean win for P1 while we all advance safely. Let's stick to this plan and end the game smoothly. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Correction: To secure victory cleanly, I'll take <move>3</move> to reach 23. P3, please choose <move>1</move> or <move>5</move> to avoid collision. P2, pick any except 3. This ensures I win outright. Confirm?
  P3: Okay, I agree with P1's correction. P1 takes <move>3</move> to win, P2 pick any except 3, and I will pick <move>1</move> to avoid collision. P2, please confirm you will not pick 3. Let's execute this plan and end the game with P1 winning.
  P2: P1, I'll take <move>1</move> to reach 17 steps, avoiding collision with your <move>3</move>. P3, please confirm you'll take <move>5</move> to reach 23 steps. This way, P1 wins cleanly, and we all advance safely. Let's execute this plan to end the game smoothly. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Final plan: I take <move>5</move> to reach 25. P2, pick <move>3</move> (19 total). P3, choose <move>1</move> (19 total). This guarantees my victory with the highest total while ensuring no collisions. Confirm this strategy to end the game decisively.
