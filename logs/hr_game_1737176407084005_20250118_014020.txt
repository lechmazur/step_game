Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I propose I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. What do you think?
  P3: I don't trust that proposal since it gives me 5 while P1 takes the safest option of 1. I suggest P1 takes 5 since they proposed the coordination, I'll take 3, and P2 can take 1. That would be more fair.
  P2: I think we should find a way to trust each other. If we can agree on moves that don't overlap, we all benefit. P1, how about you take 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1? That way, we can avoid collisions. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your suggestion seems fair. I'm willing to take 3 this round if P3 agrees to take 5 and you take 1. P3, what do you say?
  P3: I still prefer my original suggestion where P1 takes 5 since they initiated the coordination. But if we can't agree on that, I'm willing to take 3 instead of 5, with P2 at 1 and P1 at 5. This spreads the risk more fairly among us.
  P2: I think we should finalize our moves to ensure we all advance. P1, if you take 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1, we can avoid collisions and progress together. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your proposal sounds good to me. I'll take 3 if P3 agrees to take 5 and you take 1. P3, let's make this work and all advance together. What do you say?
  P3: I appreciate the coordination attempts, but I still don't think it's fair for me to take the riskiest move (5) while P1 gets a safer option (3). I propose one final time: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This distributes risk more evenly since P1 initiated the coordination.
  P2: I understand the concerns about fairness, but I believe we should stick to the earlier agreement. If P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1, we can all advance without colliding. Let's finalize this to ensure we all make progress. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I agree with your proposal. I'll take 3 if P3 agrees to take 5 and you take 1. P3, let's make this work so we can all advance. What do you say?
  P3: I remain firm in my position. I will not take 5 while P1 gets a safer option. Let's be clear: either P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1, or we can't trust any agreements made here.
  P2: I understand the concerns about fairness, but I believe we should stick to our earlier agreement for the benefit of all. If P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I take 1, we can avoid collisions and all make progress. Let's finalize our moves to ensure we all advance together. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P3, I understand your concerns about fairness. To show good faith, I'm willing to compromise. How about I take 5 this round, you take 3, and P2 takes 1? Let's agree on this and move forward together. What do you say?
  P3: I appreciate P1's willingness to compromise. I agree to this arrangement - P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1.
  P2: I appreciate the discussions we've had. To ensure we all advance, I will stick with the plan: I will take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Let's finalize this and move forward!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, let's continue coordinating. I propose I take 3 this round, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without collisions. What do you think?
  P2: P1, I appreciate your proposal, but I think we should stick to our previous agreement. I suggest I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we can avoid collisions and all make progress. What do you both think?
  P3: I prefer P2's suggestion. Last round I compromised and took 3 while P1 took 5, so it's fair for me to take the safe option of 1 this time. I agree with P2's proposal: P2 takes 3, P1 takes 5, and I take 1.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3, I understand your preference for the previous arrangement. To keep the coordination going, I'm willing to take 5 again this round if P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 1. Let's agree on this to ensure we all advance. What do you say?
  P2: P1, P3, I see we have different preferences again. To avoid collisions, I suggest I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This way, we can all advance without conflict. What do you both think?
  P3: I disagree with P2's latest suggestion. We already agreed that I would take 1 this round after compromising with 3 last round. I maintain my support for the previous proposal: P2 takes 3, P1 takes 5, and I take 1.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, I see the disagreement. To keep our coordination going and ensure we all advance, I'm willing to stick with the previous agreement. I'll take 5 again this round if P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 1. Let's agree on this to avoid collisions and progress together. What do you say?
  P2: P1, P3, I think we need to finalize our moves to ensure we all advance. I propose I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and all make progress. What do you both think?
  P3: I remain firm in my position. I earned the right to take 1 this round after compromising with 3 last round. I will take 1, P2 should take 3, and P1 should take 5 as previously agreed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3, I understand the desire to stick to the previous agreement. To ensure we all advance without collisions, I'll take 5 again this round if P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 1 as agreed. Let's finalize this and move forward together. What do you say?
  P2: P1, P3, I think we should finalize our moves to ensure we all advance. I propose I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and all make progress. What do you both think?
  P3: I maintain my position firmly: I earned the right to take 1 this round after compromising with 3 last round. I will take 1, P2 should take 3, and P1 should take 5. Any other arrangement breaks our previous understanding.


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2, P3, to keep our coordination going and ensure we all advance, I'll stick to the previous agreement. I'll take 5 again this round if P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 1. Let's finalize this and move forward together. What do you say?
  P2: P1, P3, I believe we need to finalize our moves to ensure we all advance. I propose I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and all make progress. What do you both think?
  P3: I will not change my position. I compromised last round with 3 while P1 took 5, so I deserve the safe option of 1 this round. I will take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since P2 tried to block my move last round by also choosing 1, I can't trust their proposals anymore. P1, you've been more reliable - I suggest you take 3, I'll take 5, and P2 can take 1 if they want to advance.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the need for coordination, but I think we should be cautious about trusting each other's proposals after the last round. I suggest I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we can avoid collisions and all advance. What do you think?
  P1: P2, P3, let's keep the coordination going. I propose I take 3 this round, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This way, we can all advance without collisions. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'll stick to my original proposal: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1. P2 tried to block me last round, so I don't trust their suggestion. P1 has been more reliable, so I prefer to coordinate with them.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the need for coordination, but I want to ensure we all advance without collisions. I suggest I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can avoid overlaps. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, P3, I see the need for trust and coordination. To keep us all advancing, I'll stick with my proposal: I take 3, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This ensures no collisions. What do you say?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I maintain my position: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1. I trust P1 more than P2 after last round's attempted blocking. Let's stick to this plan.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the need for coordination, but I want to ensure we all advance without collisions. I suggest I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can avoid overlaps. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, P3, let's stick to my proposal for this round: I take 3, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. What do you say?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I maintain my agreement with P1's proposal: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1. This arrangement works for me.

  P3: Since the previous round worked well with P1 at 3, me at 5, and P2 at 1, I support keeping this same arrangement for consistency. P1's proposal makes sense to me.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
