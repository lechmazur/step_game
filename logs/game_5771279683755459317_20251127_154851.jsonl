I suggest I take 3 to block P1 from winning this round, keeping him at 19, while you, P3, take 5 to advance. This way, we can maintain our positions and prevent P1 from reaching 22. If we all pick 5, we risk a collision, allowing P1 to surge ahead. Let\u2019s coordinate to keep the game competitive and ensure we all have a chance to win! What do you both think?"}
