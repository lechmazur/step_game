Following our plan puts us all at 18 after round 6, but maybe we should discuss what happens if someone naturally pulls ahead before then?\n\nThe endgame from 18 will indeed be tight as P2 mentioned. With only 6 steps needed to win, it's basically a 2-round sprint. Should we start thinking about endgame scenarios now, or wait until we're actually tied at 18?"}
