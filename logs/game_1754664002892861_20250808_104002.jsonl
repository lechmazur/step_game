As the leader at 21, I\u2019ll stick to picking 1 under the anti-leader rule. P2, I understand P1\u2019s concern about the risk of a solo 5 beating your 3, but I believe taking 3 is safe if we all commit to no 5s. Let\u2019s finalize R11 as P1=1, P2=3, P3=1 to balance advancement. Enforcement and no-sabotage rules apply. If we\u2019re aligned, I\u2019m ready to proceed. Do you both confirm this plan?"}
