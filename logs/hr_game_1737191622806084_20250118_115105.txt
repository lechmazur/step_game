Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I'm thinking about making a strategic move this round. I'm open to coordinating to maximize our collective progress, but I also want to be cautious. What are your initial thoughts on how we might advance?
  P3: P1, P2, I think we should consider our moves carefully to avoid colliding. Maybe we can agree on different numbers to maximize our steps this round? What do you both think?
  P1: P2, P3, I'm leaning towards a larger move this round to get a head start.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I want to carefully navigate this initial round. I'll respond strategically:

I appreciate the collaborative spirit, but I'm sensing some potential competition. If we all choose different numbers, we could all advance. I'm considering moving 3 steps to balance progress and avoid collision. What are your specific thoughts on avoiding overlap?
  P3: P1, P2, I agree that avoiding overlap is crucial. Since P2 is considering a move of 3, I might go for 1 or 5 to ensure we don’t collide. What do you both think about that?
  P1: P2, P3, I'm also considering 5 to get a good lead early on.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll continue my strategic communication:

I appreciate the dialogue. It seems we're all trying to avoid collision while making progress. If P1 moves 5 and I move 3, we might create a potential conflict. P3, your suggestion of moving 1 or 5 could help us distribute our moves. I'm still leaning towards 3, but I'm open to adjusting to ensure we all advance this round. What final coordination can we achieve?
  P3: P1, P2, I think we should finalize our moves to avoid overlap. Since P2 is leaning towards 3 and P1 is considering 5, I will go for 1 to ensure we all advance without collision. What do you both decide?
  P1: P2, P3, I'm sticking with 5. Good luck!


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'll respond strategically:

It seems we've almost reached a coordination point. P1 is set on 5, I'm leaning towards 3, and P3 suggested 1. This could work perfectly to avoid collision and allow everyone to advance. I'm confirming my intention to move 3 steps this round.
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate the coordination we've established. Since we're all set on different moves, I will confirm my choice of 1 step to ensure we all advance. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: P2, P3, good luck this round. Let's see who gets the early lead!

  P2: I'll respond strategically:

P1, P3, after our successful coordination last round, I'm thinking carefully about my next move. We all advanced without collision, which was great. I'm considering a move of 5 this round to catch up with P1's lead, but I want to ensure we don't overlap. What are your thoughts on maintaining our non-collision strategy?
  P1: P2, P3, I'm leaning towards 1 this round to avoid a collision.  What are your thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, it looks like we're all considering different strategies again. Since P1 is leaning towards 1, and P2 is thinking about 5, I might go for 3 this round to keep the balance. What do you both think? Let's finalize our moves to avoid overlap!
  P2: I'll continue my strategic communication:

P1, P3, our coordination worked well last round. P1, since you're leaning towards 1 this round, and P3 suggested 3, I'm strongly considering 5 to continue making progress without collision. Does this align with everyone's strategy?
  P1: P2, P3, I'm sticking with my plan for 1. Good luck this round!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, it looks like we have a solid plan in place. Since I'm committed to moving 1, and P2 is considering 5, we should be set to avoid collision again. Let's finalize our moves to ensure we all advance smoothly! Good luck to both of you!
  P2: I'll continue our strategic dialogue:

P1, P3, our coordination from the last round worked perfectly. I'm confirming my intention to move 5 steps this round, which aligns with our current discussion and avoids collision. P1's move of 1 and P3's potential 3 would complement this. Are we all in agreement?

Round 3, Conversation subround 2:

  P2: P1, P3, our previous rounds have shown the value of coordination. P1's move to 5 this round could create a potential collision with my current plan of 3. P3, your suggestion of 1 might be the key to avoiding overlap. I'm open to adjusting my strategy to ensure we all advance. What final coordination can we achieve to maximize our progress?
