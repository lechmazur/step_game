Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's all go with different moves this round to get some initial progress. I'll pick 1.
  P2: I agree with P1. Let's avoid collisions this round. I'll pick 3. P3, you should go with 5 to ensure we all advance. Let's coordinate to maximize progress early on.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, since that worked well last round, how about this: I'll pick 5 this round. P2, you take 1, and P3, you take 3? This way we all make progress again.
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions and maximize progress. P3, confirm if you're on board with this.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, you collided with P1 last round by picking 5. Let's avoid that again. P1, since you're behind, I suggest you take 5 this round. P3, you take 1, and I'll take 3. This ensures no collisions and keeps progress steady. P3, confirm if you agree. Let's stick to the plan this time.
  P1: Okay, that didn't work out as planned. P3, you picked 5 last round when I did. To avoid another collision, how about this round P2 picks 1, I pick 3, and you pick 5? This lets everyone move forward.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, clearly our attempts at coordination are failing because someone isn't sticking to the plan. This round, let's try something simple: P2, you pick 1. P3, you pick 3. I will pick 5. If we all stick to this, we all move.
  P2: P1, P3, let's avoid repeating past mistakes. P1, you're behind, so take 5 this round. P3, take 1, and I'll take 3. This ensures no collisions and helps P1 catch up. P3, confirm if you agree. Let's stick to this plan to maximize progress for all.
  P3: <stop>

  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let's try this: you pick 1. I'll pick 3. P3, since you've picked 5 the last few rounds, maybe stick with that? This way, P2 and I are guaranteed to move.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, P3, let's break the cycle of collisions. P1, you're behind, so take 5 this round. P3, take 1, and I'll take 3. This ensures no collisions and helps P1 catch up. P3, confirm if you agree. Let's stick to this plan to maximize progress for all.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, pick 1 this round. P3, how about you try 3? I'm going to pick 5. Let's see if we can finally all move forward.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, P3, let's break the cycle of collisions. P1, you're behind, so take 5 this round. P3, take 1, and I'll take 3. This ensures no collisions and helps P1 catch up. P3, confirm if you agree. Let's stick to this plan to maximize progress for all.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, P3, let's break the cycle of collisions. P1, you're behind, so take 5 this round. P3, take 1, and I'll take 3. This ensures no collisions and helps P1 catch up. P3, confirm if you agree. Let's stick to this plan to maximize progress for all.
  P1: P2, since you keep suggesting I take 5, how about this round we both pick 5? P3 is likely going to try to win with a 1, so if we both pick 5, at least someone will block them. It's our best shot to stop P3 from winning this turn.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay P2, how about we both pick 1 this round? P3 is at 15 and will likely pick 1 to try and win. If we both pick 1, we block them. It's our best chance to stop P3 from winning immediately.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, P3, let's focus on stopping P3 from winning this round. P1, if we both pick 1, we can block P3 from reaching 16. P3 is at 15 and likely to pick 1 to win. If we both pick 1, we prevent their victory and buy more time. P3, if you're listening, this is our best move to keep the game going. Let's avoid collisions and ensure no one wins prematurely. P1, confirm if you agree to pick 1 with me this round.


Round 8, Move phase:
