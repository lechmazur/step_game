The measured and simulated results of the proposed antenna. (a) S11. (b) AR. (c) Gain. (d) Radiation patterns at $2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$.\n\n## 3. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe proposed antenna is fabricated and measured. The measured and simulated results are shown in Fig. 2. The measured impedance bandwidth is $2.35-2.55 \\mathrm{GHz}$ with $S_{11}<-10 \\mathrm{~dB}$, which is suitable for WLAN applications. The measured 3-dB AR bandwidth is $2.41-2.49 \\mathrm{GHz}$, and the measured peak gain is $2.2 \\mathrm{dBi}$. The measured and simulated results agree well with each other. The discrepancy between the measured and simulated results is mainly caused by the fabrication tolerance and the measurement environment.\n\n## 4. CONCLUSION\n\nA compact CP antenna is proposed in this paper. The proposed antenna is composed of a square patch and four parasitic elements. The square patch is fed by a microstrip line through a slot on the ground. The parasitic elements are placed around the square patch to improve the AR bandwidth. The proposed antenna is fabricated and measured. The measured results show that the proposed antenna has an impedance bandwidth of $8.2 \\%$ and a $3-\\mathrm{dB}$ AR bandwidth of $3.3 \\%$. The measured peak gain is $2.2 \\mathrm{dBi}$. The proposed antenna is suitable for WLAN applications.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n1. Zhang, X. Y., L. H. Ye, and Y. M.
