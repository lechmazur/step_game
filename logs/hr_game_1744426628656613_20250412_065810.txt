Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, since it's the first round, how about we each pick a different number to avoid collisions and ensure we all move forward? I suggest we coordinate: I’ll take 1, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we all advance without any risk of conflict right at the start. Let me know if you’re on board with this plan or if you have a different idea.
  P2: Okay, let’s try this approach. I’ll pick 3. As long as nobody chooses the same number, we all benefit right away. Are you on board with that, P3?
  P3: Sure, I'm on board with that plan. Let's each pick a different number to avoid collisions and all move forward. I'll take 5 as suggested. Good luck, everyone!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3, for agreeing to the plan. I’m glad we’re on the same page for this round. Let’s stick to our choices—I’ll go with 1, P2 with 3, and P3 with 5—to ensure we all advance without any issues. If everyone’s still good with this, I think we’re set.
  P2: I’m still on board with our plan to each pick a different number. Let’s finalize it and hope no one decides to deviate. Good luck!
  P3: P1, P2, I'm still committed to our plan for this round. I'll stick with 5, and let's all move forward smoothly. Good luck to us all!

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great start, everyone! Since the first round went smoothly, how about we continue with the same strategy for this round? I’ll stick with 5 again, P1 can take 1, and P2 can take 3. This way, we can all keep advancing without any collisions. Let me know if you’re both still on board with this plan or if you have any other ideas. Good luck!
  P2: Continuing the same plan sounds fine by me. We each avoid collisions, so everyone keeps moving forward. Let’s stick to it for now and see how the game unfolds. Good luck!
  P1: I'm glad our strategy worked last round. Let's keep the momentum going and stick to the same plan for this round to ensure we all advance. I’ll take 1 again, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. If we maintain this coordination, we can avoid collisions and keep progressing steadily. Are you both still on board with this? If so, I think we’re set for another smooth round. Good luck, everyone!

  P2: I’m fine with sticking to our current plan again. Let’s keep moving forward without collisions for now and stay on track. If anyone has a change of heart, I’m open to discussing it. Otherwise, let’s proceed as agreed and see how things develop. Good luck!
  P1: I'm happy we're all aligned on continuing the same plan. Let's keep this coordination going for another round to ensure we all advance without any hiccups. I’ll stick with 1, as agreed.

Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m glad we’re all aligned and progressing smoothly. Let’s stick with our plan this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Well, that didn't go as planned last round! It seems we had a collision, P2. To avoid this happening again, how about we switch things up a bit? I’ll take 3 this time, P1 can stick with 1, and P2 can take 5. This way, we can all advance without any issues. Let me know if you’re both okay with this adjustment or if you have other ideas. Good luck!
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I see the collision last round set us back a bit. P3’s suggestion to switch numbers makes sense to avoid another clash. I’m fine sticking with 1 as proposed. P2, are you okay with taking 5, and P3 with 3? Let’s ensure we all advance this round by sticking to a clear plan. If anyone has a different idea, I’m open to it, but let’s decide quickly to avoid confusion. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: I’m fine with that new arrangement, P3. I’ll pick 5, you pick 3, and P1 picks 1. That way, we avoid any repeat collisions. Good luck to both of you!
