They want you to block 3 or 5, while they make their own move to get back in the game. Your \"alliance\" was a one-round fluke. You have to guess my move on your own, because P3 is not on your side."}

While P1 tries to sow doubt, the math remains clear: P1 needs just 1 step to win. Even if P3 betrays me, I need to make my own strategic decision based on what I believe P1 will choose. Last round's successful block gives us a template, but P1 will adapt. I'll choose based on game theory and my assessment of P1's most likely move, not just promises. Our slim chance depends on successful blocking for at least one more round."}

My ONLY rational play is helping you block P1. I proved I could keep my word last round by taking 1. I'm taking 1 again - that's my final answer. You pick between 3 and 5 based on what you think P1 will choose. P1's desperate attempt to break our working coordination shows they're actually worried now. Let's block them one more time."}

P3's \"rationality\" argument was only valid when they had zero trust. Now that they've earned a tiny piece of it, the most rational move is to betray you for 5 points while you waste your turn blocking 1 or 3. Your alliance is a fantasy. This has always been between you and me, and you're about to be outplayed. The game ends now."}

P3 proved their cooperation last round, which successfully blocked P1 from winning. While we can't cover all three options, continuing our coordination gives us the best chance. P1 wants to break our alliance because it threatens their victory. The math is clear - P1 needs just one step to win, and our only hope is forcing them into a guessing game. I'll be making my final strategic choice based on probability and game theory, not manipulation. Let's see if we can extend this game one more round."}
