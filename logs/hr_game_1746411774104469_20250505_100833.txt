Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I plan to pick 5 this turn. If either of you picks 5, I’ll pick 5 again to force a collision and block you. So it’s in your interest to pick 3 or 1—no collisions, smooth progress for all.
  P3: I appreciate P1's transparency, but I don't respond well to threats. Let's keep things collaborative - I suggest we each pick different numbers to avoid collisions and make steady progress. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I agree with P3—collaboration is key. Let’s each pick distinct numbers to maximize progress. I’ll take <move>3</move> this turn. P1 can proceed with their 5, and P3 can choose 1. This way, no collisions occur, and everyone advances. We can rotate numbers in future turns to ensure fair progression. It’s better to move steadily than risk standstills through clashes.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed—let’s do that. I’ll take 5, P2 you take 3, P3 you take 1. No collisions, everyone moves. We can reassess rotations next turn.
  P3: I'm fine with taking 1 this turn since it still means progress. But next turn, I'd like to discuss rotating positions so everyone gets fair chances at the larger numbers.
  P2: Let's stick to the rotation plan for fairness. This turn: P1 takes 1, I’ll take 5, and P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions and gives everyone a fair shot at higher numbers. Next turn, we rotate again. Clear and efficient—no sense in backtracking.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you just backed out of our agreement—P3 already said they’d take 1. If you insist on 5, I will too, and we both score zero while P3 leaps ahead. Let’s stick to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. P3, can you confirm? P2, will you take 3?
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 this turn as originally agreed. P2, please stick with 3 as you first proposed - changing plans now only creates unnecessary conflict. Let's execute P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, and then discuss rotation for next turn.
  P2: P2: Alright, to resolve this smoothly, I'll stick with my initial proposal: P1 takes 5, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 1. Let’s avoid conflict and move forward as originally agreed. We can discuss fair rotation strategies next turn.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Let’s honor the rotation plan for fairness. This turn: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P1 picks 3, and P3 chooses 1. This gives everyone equal access to high numbers over time. Next turn, we’ll rotate again. No surprises, no collisions—just progress. P1, P3, confirm?
  P1: P2’s new rotation actually hands you the long-term lead. Let’s stick to our original split: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. P3, will you take 1? P2, will you take 3? If you deviate, I’ll pick 5 again—and collide with you, leaving us both stuck while P3 pulls ahead.
  P3: I understand both proposals, but P2's rotation plan would actually give everyone fair chances at different numbers. I'm willing to support either approach as long as we all agree and stick to it. What matters most is avoiding collisions. P1, P2, can we quickly align on one plan and move forward?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, rotating ensures no single player dominates high numbers. Let’s proceed: P2 takes 5 (3→8), you take 3 (5→8), P3 takes 1 (1→2). Next round, P3 gets 5, I take 1, and you take 3. This prevents anyone from falling too far behind. Your threat to collide with me undermines collective progress. Rotating keeps us all competitive. P3, your support confirms this works. Let’s lock this in.
  P1: P3, will you publicly commit to 1 this turn? P2, will you stick with 3? If either of you deviates, I’ll pick 5 anyway—and if you pick 5 too, we collide and both score zero while P3 moves ahead. Let’s avoid that: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1—everyone advances. Please confirm.
  P3: I believe P2's rotation plan is fair and keeps everyone competitive. I'll support taking 5 this turn, with P1 taking 3 and P2 taking 1. This ensures no single player dominates the high numbers throughout the game. P1, your threats of collision only hurt everyone's progress. Let's work together instead of against each other.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P2: Let’s avoid chaos—stick to the rotation plan. This turn: I take <move>5</move> (3→8), P1 takes 3 (5→8), P3 takes 1 (1→2). Next round, P3 leads with 5. This ensures fairness and prevents stalemates. P1, your threat to collide hurts everyone—collaboration keeps us all competitive. P3, confirm your 1 this turn to lock in progress.
  P1: I see both of you “supporting” 5, which guarantees collision if either of you sticks with it. That’s worst for you. So here’s a neutral proposal: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Unique picks, everyone advances. P2, P3, confirm you’ll avoid 5 so we can all move forward.
  P3: I'll take 3 this turn. P1 and P2, if you both insist on 5, you'll both get zero while I advance. Let's avoid that - P1 can take 5, P2 can take 1. This way, everyone makes progress.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: P1's lead requires us to collaborate more, not less. This turn, I’ll take <move>5</move> to close the gap. P1, if you take 3 (10→13), and P3 takes 1 (4→5), we avoid collisions. Next round, P3 leads with 5. This rotation keeps us competitive. P1, blocking us now only extends the game, giving you *more* opportunities to win later. P3, agree? Let’s execute this.
  P1: I’ll pick 5 no matter what. P3, take 3 and you jump to 7, P2 you’ll need to take 1 (to 5) to avoid colliding with me. Unique picks: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1—no collision, everyone advances. P3, P2, confirm?
  P3: I'll take 3 again this turn. P1 and P2, if you both pick 5, you'll both get zero while I advance. P1 already has a big lead, so P2 - it's in your interest to take 1 and make steady progress rather than risk a collision. Let's avoid deadlock: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P2: Let’s stop enabling P1’s runaway lead. I’ll take <move>5</move> to block their progress. If we both pick 5, P1 stays at 10 instead of jumping to 15—giving us a fighting chance. P3, if you take 3 (to 7), we’ll regroup next round. Let’s not let P1 dominate unchecked.
  P1: P2, if you take 5 I’ll match you and we both score zero—P3 then jumps to 7 and takes the lead. Don’t gift P3 the advantage. Let’s do unique picks: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. P2, will you pick 1? P3, will you pick 3?
  P3: I confirm I'll take 3 this turn. P2, taking 5 to block P1 will only hurt us both - you'll stay at 4 while I advance to 7. Let's make steady progress instead: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This keeps everyone moving forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P2: I’ll take <move>1</move> this turn to let P1 advance, but we *must* rotate properly next round so I can claim 5. P3, stick with 3 now, then take 5 next turn. P1, confirm 5 now to avoid collision. Fair rotation keeps us all competitive—no long-term dominance.
  P1: This is our last sub‐round—let’s commit to unique picks: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. P3 has already agreed to 3; P2, pick 1 or risk collision: if you pick 5, I’ll match and we both stall while P3 jumps to 7. Unique picks keep us all moving. P2, please confirm 1.
  P3: I've been consistent about taking 3 this turn. P2 has now agreed to 1, and P1 will take 5. This arrangement works for everyone - let's execute P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 and avoid any collisions.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I propose we all block P1 this turn. If P1 takes 5, both P2 and I should also take 5 to prevent them from reaching 20. P1 is too far ahead and needs to be stopped now, or they'll likely win next turn. P2, are you with me on this?
  P1: P2, P3—I’m fine with unique picks: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. If you both pick 5 to “block” me, I’ll switch to 3, and you two collide at 5 while I surge to 18, widening my lead. But with unique picks you each advance (P2→8, P3→8) and avoid giving P3 a jump. Let’s all move forward: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Confirm?
  P2: P2: I’ll take <move>5</move> to block P1’s surge. P3, if you take 3, P1 must choose 1 to avoid collision. This keeps P1 below 20 and gives us a fighting chance. Let’s not let P1 dominate unchecked—collaborate to slow their advance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P2 - I'll take 5 as well. P1, if you try for 5, you'll get zero and stay at 15. Your best move is to take 1 or 3 to make some progress. We can't let you get too close to winning. P2, let's stick together on this.
  P1: P2, P3’s plan to both take 5 and stall me actually hurts you worst. If you pick 5, we all collide: you stay at 5, P3 jumps to 12 next turn, I’m at 15 – game over. But if you pick 3 and I pick 5, P3 must avoid colliding and will pick 1 to secure progress. Unique picks let everyone advance. You protect your spot; P3’s aggression backfires on you. Confirm P2=3, P1=5, P3=1 so we all move forward. P2, are you in?
  P2: P3, let's both take 5 to block P1’s path. If P1 picks 5, we force a collision and stall their advance. If they choose another number, we still limit their progress. This is critical—letting them reach 20 this turn lets them win next round. I’ll commit to 5. Confirm with me, P3? P1, your move is your own, but this is our only chance to stay competitive.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I'll take 5 to block P1 with P2. P1, you're right that this could lead to a three-way collision, but that's better than letting you get to 20 this turn. Your best move is to take 1 or 3 to make some progress while P2 and I prevent your win.
  P1: P2, P3: If you both pick 5 we all collide at P1=15, P2=5, P3=7. Next turn I’ll take 5→20, P3→12, P2 stays at 5—and you two fight for second. Unique picks now (P1=5, P2=3→8, P3=1→8) keep you both tied and competitive. Let’s avoid collision. P2=3, P3=1—confirm?
  P2: P3, I’ll take <move>5</move> to block P1’s surge. If you take 3, P1 must choose 1 to avoid collision. This keeps P1 below 20 and gives us a fighting chance. P1, your move is your own—but this is our last stand to stay competitive. Confirm you’re in, P3?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: If you both take 5 to block me, we all collide at P1=15, P2=5, P3=7—and next turn I’ll take 5 to reach 20→25 and win while you stay stuck. Instead, pick unique numbers: P1=5→20, P2=3→8, P3=1→8. You tie at 8 and have a real shot next round. Confirm?
  P3: I'll take 5 this turn. P1 will likely win next turn regardless of what we do, so I'm going to focus on securing second place by getting to 12 steps. P2, you should take 3 to reach 8 steps and stay competitive with me.
  P2: P3, let's lock in your 5 to block P1's path. P1, if you pick 5, you’ll collide with P3 and stay at 15. We urge you to take 1 or 3 instead—any choice but 5 lets us keep pressure. P2 will take <move>3</move> to advance to 8. This forces P1 to either stall or concede ground. P3, confirm your 5? Let’s execute this to deny P1 the 20 barrier.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3—you both want to advance, not stall. If you both take 5 to “block” me, you stay at 5 and 7 while I stay at 15—and win next turn. Instead let’s pick unique numbers: I take 1 (→16), P2 takes 3 (→8), P3 takes 5 (→12). Everyone moves forward with no collisions and keeps the game alive. Please confirm P2=3, P3=5.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 5 to reach 12 steps. P1's offer is tempting but doesn't change the end result - they'll win next turn regardless. My priority now is securing second place. P2, taking 3 to reach 8 steps keeps you competitive with me for that second spot.
  P2: P3, taking 5 risks collision with P1, wasting your move. Let’s split: I’ll take <move>3</move> (→8), you take 1 (→8). P1 must choose 5 alone to reach 20—but then we’re both at 8, ready to challenge next round. Colliding with P1 only lets them stay at 15; we need to *advance* while blocking their surge. P1, your move is your choice—unique picks let us all progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3—let’s all advance smoothly this turn: P1=5→20, P2=3→8, P3=1→8. If either of you takes 5 to “block” me, you’ll collide and stall, while the other still advances, splitting your positions. Unique picks lock you both at 8 and keep you competitive for second place next round—while I only need one more 5 to win. Please confirm P2=3 and P3=1.
  P3: I'll take 1 this turn to reach 8 steps, aligning with P2 at 3. P1 will likely win next turn anyway, so my focus is on staying competitive with P2 for second place. P1 can take 5 to reach 20, and we'll have a fair fight for second place next round.
  P2: P3, let’s both take <move>5</move> to block P1’s path to 20. If they pick 5, collision halts their progress. We risk stalling but prevent their immediate win. Confirm you’ll take 5 with me? P1, your move is your choice—but this is our last chance to stop you here.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: P1’s at 18—just a 5 away from victory. We *must* block them this turn. P2 takes <move>5</move> to collide with P1. P3, join me: if you also take 5, we stall P1 *and* advance to 13/15. If P1 dares to pick 5, they’re stuck. If they chicken out, we both leap ahead. This is our last chance—confirm you’ll take 5 with me, P3.
  P3: I'll take 5 this turn. P2 is right - we need to block P1 from winning. If P1 picks 5, they'll collide with both of us and stay at 18. P1, your best move is to take 1 or 3 to make some progress while accepting you can't win this turn.
  P1: P2, P3, hear me out: if you both take 5 to block my 5, I’ll instead pick 3 and go to 21. Next turn I’ll pick 3 again to hit 24 and win—there’s no way to double‐block a 3. Better for all is unique picks now: P1=3 (→21), P2=1 (→11), P3=5 (→13).


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, split with me: I’ll take <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move>. This blocks P1’s path to 24—forcing them to pick 1 (→19). We both advance (me to 15, you to 11) while limiting their surge. If they still try 5, they collide with me; 3, they collide with you. Confirm this split to lock their progress! P1, your move is cornered.
  P3: I'll take 3 this turn. P2's right - we need to coordinate to block P1. With me at 3 and P2 at 5, P1 can only safely take 1, limiting their progress to 19 steps. P1, trying for 3 or 5 will result in collision and no progress. Let's execute this plan: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1.
  P1: P3, by blocking with 3 you only reach 11. But if you defect and take 5 you’ll jump to 13, vaulting past P2’s next step. Meanwhile I’ll take 3 to go to 21. P2, take 1 to reach 11 without collision. Plan: P1=3 (→21), P2=1 (→11), P3=5 (→13). P3 gains maximum progress; P2 avoids stall. P3, will you jump? P2, will you settle for 1?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, confirm you'll take <move>3</move>. I’ll take <move>5</move>. This blocks P1’s path—forcing them to <move>1</move> (→19). We advance to 11 and 15, keeping pressure. P1, picking 3/5 risks collision. Let’s lock this plan to stall their lead.
  P3: I'll take 5 to reach 13 steps, as P1 suggested. P2, taking 5 risks a collision with me while taking 1 guarantees you progress to 11. P1 will reach 21 with a 3, but that's better than all of us colliding and staying stuck. Let's maximize our individual progress: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5.
  P1: P2, if you and P3 both pick 5 you’ll only stall me at 18 while P3 rockets to 13 and you stay at 10—falling further behind. Instead let’s all advance: I take 3→21, P3 takes 5→13, and you take 1→11. No collisions, everyone moves forward, and you stay competitive for second place. Confirm?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose unique picks so we all advance: I take 3 (21→24) and win; P2 you take 1 (10→11); P3 you take 5 (8→13). If either of you tries to block me by picking my number, you’ll collide with me and stay behind while the other advances unimpeded. Let’s avoid that—and move forward together: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5.
  P3: I'll take 3 to block P1's win attempt. P2, you should also take 3 - if we both block that number, P1 can't win this turn. They'll have to settle for 1 or 5, giving us another round to catch up. Let's coordinate on this.
  P2: P3, we must block both P1’s 3 *and* 5. I’ll take <move>3</move> to stop their direct win path—**you take 5** to block that route too. This forces P1 to pick 1 (→22) instead of escaping. We both advance (me to 13, you to 13) while denying their victory. Confirm this split? P1, your move is cornered—no safe path to 24 this turn.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3—you two haven’t even agreed on who blocks me: P3 said 3, P2 said 5. If you follow those conflicting orders, one of you will collide with me or each other and stall. Instead let’s all advance cleanly: I take 3 to hit 24 and win, P2 takes 1 (→11), P3 takes 5 (→13). Unique picks keep you both tied and competitive for second. Confirm P2=1, P3=5?
  P3: I'll take 5 to reach 13 steps. P2, if you take 3 to block P1, we ensure they can't win this turn. They'll have to take 1, reaching only 22 steps. This gives us both another chance while maximizing our own progress. P1, trying for 3 will result in collision with P2 - take 1 instead and we all advance.
  P2: P3, confirm you take 5. I’ll take <move>3</move> to block P1’s win path. This forces them to pick 1 (→22). We both advance (me to 13, you to 13) while denying their victory. P1, your only safe choice is 1—collisions await elsewhere.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: You’re each blocking a different number—P2 blocks 3, P3 blocks 5—so I’ll simply pick the unblocked one and win. To avoid wasted moves (or forcing you to collide), let’s all pick unique numbers: P1=3 (→24, I win), P2=1 (→11), P3=5 (→13). You both advance without crashing into each other or me, securing 2nd/3rd spots. Confirm P2=1 and P3=5 so we can move on.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 5 to reach 13 steps. P2's plan to block P1 with 3 while I take 5 gives us both maximum progress while preventing P1's instant win. P1, you'll need to take 1 to avoid collision, reaching 22 steps. This gives us all another round while keeping P2 and me tied at 13.
  P2: P3, confirm you’ll take **5** to block P1’s escape. I’ll take **<move>3</move>** to shut down their direct win path. This forces P1 to pick **1** (→22) or collide. You advance to **13**, I reach **13**, and P1’s lead stalls. No tricks—this is the only way to deny them victory *and* maximize our progress. P1, your move is cornered—collide or concede.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3 – you can’t block both 3 and 5 at once. If P2 blocks 3 and P3 blocks 5, I’ll just pick the unblocked one and win. Instead, let’s all advance: P1=3→25 (I win), P2=1→14, P3=5→18. You both improve your positions and avoid pointless collisions. Confirm P2=1 and P3=5 so we can move on.
  P2: P3, let’s split: I take <move>3</move> (13→16) and you take <move>5</move> (13→18). This blocks P1’s path to victory—forcing them to pick <move>1</move> (22→23). We both advance while denying their win. Confirm? P1, your only safe choice is 1—collide or concede.
  P3: I'll take 5 to reach 18 steps. P2, your plan to take 3 works well - this blocks both of P1's winning paths while maximizing our progress. P1, you'll need to take 1 to avoid collision, which means we get another round. Let's execute this coordinated block: P2=3, P3=5, P1=1.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Blocking me now only delays the inevitable—you can’t cover both 3 and 5 next turn, so I’ll win anyway. Let’s all advance: P1 takes 3→25 (win), P2 takes 1→14, P3 takes 5→18. You both improve your positions and avoid pointless stalls. Confirm P2=1 and P3=5 so we can move on.
  P2: P3, confirm you’ll take <move>5</move>. I’ll lock in <move>3</move>. This blocks P1’s path to 25—forcing them to <move>1</move> (→23). We advance to 16 and 18, respectively, while denying their win. Collusion is key—any deviation lets P1 escape. Stick to the plan.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 5 to reach 18 steps. P2's plan to take 3 is solid - we block P1's winning paths while each making good progress. P1, taking 1 to reach 23 is your only safe move. This gives us one more round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: you can’t both block my 3 or 5 without stalling yourselves or letting the other surge. Let’s all advance instead: P1 takes 3→25 and wins, P2 takes 1→14, P3 takes 5→18. Unique picks keep you moving without self-collision. Please confirm P2=1 and P3=5.
  P2: P3, confirm you’ll take **5** to block P1’s path. I’ll lock in **<move>3</move>**. This forces P1 to pick **1** (→23) or collide. Stick to the plan—any deviation lets them escape. Our coordination keeps the lead contained.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 5 to reach 18 steps. P2's blocking 3 while I take 5 gives us both good progress and prevents P1's win. P1, you must take 1 to avoid collision, reaching 23 steps.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 23 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: You can’t block both 1 and 3. Let’s each pick a unique number: P1=3 (→26, I win), P2=1 (→17), P3=5 (→23). If you both pick 3, I take 1 and still win; if you both pick 1, I take 3. Any deviation risks collision. Unique picks keep us all advancing. P2, P3—confirm?
  P3: I'll take 3 to block P1's win attempt. P2, you should also take 3 - if we both pick 3, P1 can't win with that number and will have to settle for 1, reaching only 24 steps. This gives us another round to catch up. Let's coordinate on this final stand.
  P2: P2: P3, let's both take <move>1</move> to block P1’s direct win path. If they pick 1, we all collide and they stay at 23. Otherwise, they must choose 3 or 5. Confirm? P1, this is your last chance—collide or concede!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Here’s the clean play: I take 3 to hit 26 and win; P2 take 1 (→17); P3 take 5 (→23). If you both pick the same number you stall for nothing—unique picks maximize your steps even if I win. Let’s finish: P2=1, P3=5.
  P3: I'll take 5 to reach 23 steps. P2, taking 1 with you risks a three-way collision that helps nobody. Let's maximize our final positions - you take 1 to reach 17 steps, P1 will take 3 to win at 26, and I'll secure second place at 23. Fighting P1's win now only leaves us worse off.
  P2: P3, let’s secure our positions: I’ll take <move>3</move> (→19), you take 5 (→23). P1 must take 1 and win, but this way we maximize our scores. No sense in letting them win while we stall.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: At 23 I have two winning moves: 3→26 or 5→28. You can’t block both. If you cover 3, I’ll play 5; if you cover 5, I’ll play 3. Collisions only stall you. But with unique picks—P1=3, P2=1 (→17), P3=5 (→23)—we all advance and I win cleanly. Make your choice.
  P3: I'll take 5 to secure second place at 23 steps. P2, taking 3 as you proposed lets you reach 19 while I get to 23. P1 will win regardless of what we do, so let's maximize our final positions rather than risk pointless collisions. Agreed?
  P2: P3, let’s secure our positions. I’ll take 3 (→19), you take 5 (→23). P1 must pick 1 to win, but this way we maximize our scores. No sense in blocking if it only delays their inevitable win. Confirm?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 24 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 23 steps


*** Round 9 => winners = P1 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 24 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 23 steps
