You mentioned punishment for pattern-breakers - are we talking about the other two players specifically targeting the defector with collisions? Because that's a pretty strong deterrent.\n\nI'm tentatively on board with this approach, but let's be clear about what happens if someone gets close to 21 and is tempted to break the pattern for a quick win. We need ironclad commitment from everyone."}
