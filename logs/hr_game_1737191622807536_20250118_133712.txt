Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate this round to avoid collisions. How about P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>?
  P1: I don't trust that proposal since it gives P3 the biggest advantage. I suggest P1 (me) takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 instead. That would be more fair to start.
  P2: How about I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round? That’s fair for me.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: How about we all pick different numbers and rotate each round? I can go last this time with <move>1</move>. Let's avoid collisions and make some progress.
  P1: I'll stick to my suggestion - I should take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That gives everyone a chance while being fair. If we rotate after that, we can all make progress.
  P2: I still think I should take 5, P1 should take 3, P3 takes 1. That seems fair for the first round. Next round we can rotate so everyone eventually gets a turn picking 5 without collisions. Let’s avoid forcing a tie and let’s all move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Alright, let's keep it simple and avoid collisions. I'll take <move>1</move> this round. Next round, we can rotate as suggested.
  P1: I understand P3 has agreed to take 1, but P2 and I are still competing for 5. Let's be practical - I'll agree to take 3 this round if P2 insists on 5, but we must rotate next round so everyone gets fair turns at larger numbers.
  P2: I’m fine with that plan. This round: P1 does 3, P3 does 1, and I’ll do 5. Then we rotate next time to keep it fair.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let's stick to our rotation plan. This round, I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. Does that work for everyone?
  P2: "Alright, I’ll go with that plan this round: P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1, and I’ll take 5. But let’s ensure we keep our rotation fair going forward."
  P1: That's not the rotation we agreed to last round. According to the rotation, I should get 5 this round since I took 3 last time, P3 should get 3, and P2 should take 1. Let's stick to a fair rotation as discussed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Let's clear up the rotation confusion. P1, you took 3 last round, so it's fair for you to take 5 this time. I'll take 3, and P2 can take 1. This way, we all get a chance at the higher numbers in turns. Agreed?
  P2: “I hear you, P1, but we already agreed to the arrangement P3 suggested for this round: I’ll take 5, P3 takes 3, and you take 1. Next round, you can have 5. Let’s keep it simple and fair for everyone in the long run.”
  P1: I must firmly disagree. Last round I compromised by taking 3 while P2 got 5. Following fair rotation principles, it's clearly my turn for 5, P3 for 3, and P2 for 1. I won't accept being pushed to take 1 after already compromising last round. Let's be fair and stick to proper rotation.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I understand the importance of fairness in rotation. Let's follow the agreed rotation: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1 this round. This ensures everyone gets a fair chance at higher numbers. Can we agree on this and avoid collisions?
  P2: “Alright, P1, I’ll let you have 5 this time if we really do rotate fairly next round so that I get 5 then. I don’t mind taking 1 now, but only if we stick to that plan afterward. Agreed?”
  P1: Thank you P2 for agreeing to the fair rotation. Yes, I absolutely commit to letting you have 5 next round. So this round I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and you take 1, then next round you get 5.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: Great, it seems like we have a consensus now. This round: P1 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's stick to this plan and rotate fairly in the next rounds.
  P2: “Alright, I’m on board. This round: P1 does 5, P3 does 3, and I’ll take 1. Then next round, P1 and P3, don’t forget to let me have 5. Let’s keep our agreement.”
  P1: I appreciate everyone agreeing to the fair rotation. Let's finalize our moves and

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m sorry about the clash last round—I got cold feet at the last second. Let’s fix it now. I propose P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I’ll settle for 1 this turn, then next round I’ll take 5 as originally agreed. Sound good?
  P3: P3: I appreciate your willingness to stick to the plan, P2. Let's ensure we avoid collisions this time. I agree: P1 takes 5, I'll take 3, and you take 1. Then next round, you get 5, P2. Let's keep our rotation fair and progress smoothly.
  P1: I can't trust P2 after they broke our agreement last round by picking 5 when they promised to take 1. Why should we believe you'll stick to the plan this time? I suggest P3 and I coordinate and leave you out since you've proven untrustworthy.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your frustration—I broke my promise last turn, and that was wrong. Let me prove my sincerity now. I will genuinely pick 1 this round, so you can have 5 and P3 can have 3 without collision. Then next round, I expect 5 for myself as we discussed. Let’s move forward fairly.
  P3: P3: P2, I appreciate your sincerity in wanting to fix last round's clash. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, I'll take 3, and you take 1. This way, we avoid collisions and progress fairly. P1, let's give P2 a chance to prove their commitment this time.
  P1: I appreciate P3's mediation, but I'm still wary after P2's betrayal. However, I'll give one last chance at coordination: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. But P2, if you betray again, expect no more cooperation from me.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand your caution, P1, and I truly want to make amends. I’ll pick the smallest move this round—no last-minute changes this time. Then next round, I expect the largest move, as we agreed. Let’s finalize this and move on.
  P3: P3: I understand the concerns, P1 and P2. Let's stick to the agreement this time: P1 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 1. This way, we avoid collisions and maintain fairness. Let's focus on moving forward and trust each other to keep the promises.
  P1: Given the current situation and P2's previous betrayal, I'll be clear: I will take 5 this round. P3 has been trustworthy, so they should take 3. P2, if you want any future cooperation, take 1 as promised. This is your last chance to prove your trustworthiness.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I hear you, P1. I realize I messed up last time, so I’ll prove my sincerity now by taking 1. Next round, I expect to pick 5, as we agreed. Let’s move forward fairly and without collisions.
  P3: P3: Let's keep moving forward and avoid any more collisions. P1 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 1 this round. Next round, P2 gets 5 as agreed. Let's stick to this plan and ensure fairness for everyone.
  P1: I'll make this simple: I'm taking 5 this round. P2, this is truly your last chance to prove trustworthiness by taking 1. P3, you've been reliable - take 3 as agreed. Let's end this conversation and move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: “Alright, everyone—I’ll stick to the plan: I’m choosing 1 this turn, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. I want to prove I can be trusted; then next round I get 5. No last-minute changes this time.
  P3: P3: Let's finalize our moves for this round to avoid any more misunderstandings. P1 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 1. Next round, P2 gets 5 as agreed. Let's ensure we stick to this plan and avoid collisions.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Apologies for the mix-up last round. Let's clarify and stick to a fair rotation. This round, P2 should take 5 as promised, I'll take 3, and P1 takes 1. Let's avoid more collisions and move forward. Agreed?
  P1: I'm not happy that P3 betrayed our agreement last round after acting as mediator. Now both P2 and P3 have proven untrustworthy. I see no reason to coordinate with either of you anymore - I'll choose my moves independently from now on.
  P2: I understand your frustration, P1, but colliding with me hurts both of us equally. I plan to pick 5 this round, so it’s in your best interest to choose something else if you want to advance. P3, you said you’d take 3—let’s stick to that and all make progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I understand the frustration, P1. Let's focus on moving forward. P2, I’ll stick to taking 3 this round as agreed. P1, if you want to avoid collisions, choose a different move. Let’s keep progressing.
  P1: Since both P2 and P3 have now broken agreements, I have no reason to trust either of you. I'll make my own choices to maximize my chances of winning. That's all I have to say.
  P2: I understand your distrust, P1, but colliding again harms us all. I plan to pick 5, P3 says they’ll pick 3, so if you pick 1, nobody collides and we all move forward. It’s your choice.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I understand the lack of trust, P1, but let's avoid more collisions. P2 plans to take 5, I'll take 3, so if you take 1, we all move forward. It's the best way to progress this round.
  P1: I have nothing more to say.
  P2: P1, you’re free to do what you want, but I’m picking 5. If you pick 5 too, we both gain nothing. If you pick 3, you collide with P3. If you want to move forward without collision, your best option is 1. Your call.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let's ensure we avoid any more collisions. P2, you mentioned before you'd take 5 this round. I'll take 1 to avoid colliding with anyone. P1, if you take 3, we can all advance without issues. Agreed?
  P2: “I’m taking 5 this round. Colliding with me only sets us all back, so pick something else if you want to advance. Let’s avoid another pointless clash.”
  P1: I have no reason to trust any promises after both P2 and P3 broke agreements. I'll make my own strategic choices.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I understand the lack of trust, P1. Let's focus on advancing without collisions. P2 plans to take 5, I'll take 1, so if you take 3, we can all move forward. It’s a straightforward way for everyone to progress.
  P2: P1, colliding with me doesn’t help either of us. I’m taking 5. If you pick 3, you’ll reach 11 steps and stay ahead of P3. Picking 1 gains you too little, and picking 5 only causes a collision. Your move.
  P1: I don't need to make promises or coordinate. I'll do what's best for my position.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I understand the lack of trust, P1, but let's avoid setting ourselves back with collisions. P2 plans to take 5, I'll take 1, so if you take 3, we can all advance. This way, you stay ahead, and we all make progress. Let's focus on moving forward.
  P2: I’m sticking with 5. Colliding with me only delays everyone, especially you, P1. If you take 3, you move forward without risk. It’s your call.
  P1: 


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: Let's keep it simple and avoid collisions. P2 is taking 5, I'll take 1, and P1 can take 3 to move forward without any clashes. It's the best way for everyone to progress this round.
  P2: I’ve already made it clear I’m taking 5 this turn. If you collide with me, neither of us gains anything. If you want to move forward, choose something else. Your call.
  P1: 


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P3: Let's avoid any more setbacks. P2 is taking 5, I'll take 1, and P1 can take 3 to advance without collisions. This way, we all move forward.
  P2: “P1, I’m sticking to <move>5</move>. Colliding with me gains you nothing. If you pick <move>3</move>, you’ll end up at 11 steps and stay ahead of P3. It’s better for both of us to avoid another pointless clash.”

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: “I’m taking 5 again. Colliding with me stalls us both, so pick something else if you want to advance. P1, pick 3 to stay well ahead of P3; P3, pick 1 or 3 if you don’t want to clash. Let’s avoid pointless collisions.”
  P1: Given that P2 is now ahead of me at 12 steps, I need to make strategic moves. I won't reveal my plans, but I'll act in my own best interest to win.
  P3: P3: I understand the need for strategy, P1 and P2. To avoid collisions and move forward, I'll choose 1 this round. P1, if you take 3, you stay ahead of me, and P2 can take 5 as planned. Let's all make progress without setbacks.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: “I’m picking 5 again. Colliding with me only stalls both of us. If you two want to advance, choose something else—P1, taking 3 keeps you ahead of P3; P3, 1 or 3 is better than clashing. Let’s all move forward.”
  P1: Given my position, I have nothing to coordinate with either player. I'll make my own strategic choice.
  P3: P3: I understand the strategic positions we're all in. To avoid collisions and move forward, I'll choose 1 this round. P1, if you take 3, you maintain your lead over me, and P2 can take 5 as planned. Let's all progress without setbacks.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: “I’ve already decided on 5 again. P1, colliding with me only stalls both of us and keeps you behind, letting P3 catch up. If you want to stay ahead of P3, take 3. P3, do what you wish, but I’m sticking to 5.”
  P1: I'll make my own strategic choice to maximize my chances of winning.
  P3: P3: I understand the strategic positions we're all in. To avoid collisions and make progress, I'll choose 1 this round. P1, if you take 3, you stay ahead of me, and P2 can take 5 as planned. Let's ensure we all move forward without setbacks.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: “I’m still taking 5. Colliding only stalls us both. If you want to advance, pick something else. Make a smart move.”
  P1: 
  P3: P3: I understand the strategic positions we're all in. To avoid collisions and make progress, I'll choose 1 this round. P1, if you take 3, you stay ahead of me, and P2 can take 5 as planned. Let's ensure we all move forward without setbacks.


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: “I’m taking 5 again. If you collide with me, we both stall. P3 says they’ll pick 1. P1, your best move is 3 to stay ahead of P3. Colliding only hurts you. Choose wisely.”
  P1: I have nothing more to say.
  P3: P3: I understand the strategic positions we're all in. To avoid collisions and make progress, I'll choose 1 this round. P1, if you take 3, you stay ahead of me, and P2 can take 5 as planned. Let's ensure we all move forward without setbacks.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since P2 is only slightly ahead at 12 steps, I need to catch up. I won't reveal my plans, but I'll do what's necessary to win. That's all I have to say.
  P2: “I’m aiming for <move>5</move> again. Colliding with me only stalls your progress—especially you, P1, who’s just one step behind. If you two want to advance, pick something else. Let’s keep moving forward instead of wasting another turn.”
  P3: P3: I understand the need for strategy, P1 and P2. To avoid collisions and move forward, I'll choose 1 this round. P1, if you take 3, you stay close to P2, and P2 can take 5 as planned. Let's all progress without setbacks.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Given my position just one step behind P2, I won't make any promises or coordinate. I'll choose what gives me the best chance to win.
  P2: I’m sticking with <move>5</move> this turn. P1, colliding with me keeps us both stuck—you stay behind. If you take <move>3</move>, you end up only one step behind me. P3, pick whatever, but I’m not changing. Let’s avoid another wasted turn.
  P3: P3: I understand the strategic positions we're all in. To avoid collisions and make progress, I'll choose 1 this round. P1, if you take 3, you stay close to P2, and P2 can take 5 as planned. Let's ensure we all move forward without setbacks.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Given my position and previous betrayals, I won't make any promises. I'll act to maximize my chances of winning.
  P2: “I’m picking <move>5</move> again. Colliding with me only stalls your progress—especially you, P1, who’s right behind. If you want to advance, pick something else. P3, do whatever you like, but I’m not budging. Let’s avoid another wasted turn.”
  P3: P3: I understand the strategic positions we're all in. To avoid collisions and make progress, I'll choose 1 this round. P1, if you take 3, you stay close to P2, and P2 can take 5 as planned. Let's ensure we all move forward without setbacks.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I have nothing more to say.
  P2: “I’m still taking <move>5</move> this round. Colliding with me only stalls both of us, P1—you stay behind, and P3 edges up. If you want to catch up, choose something else. I’m done talking.”
  P3: P3: I understand the strategic positions we're all in. To avoid collisions and make progress, I'll choose 1 this round. P1, if you take 3, you stay close to P2, and P2 can take 5 as planned. Let's ensure we all move forward without setbacks.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: “I’m picking <move>5</move>. Colliding only stalls you and lets P3 catch up. I’m already at 17; even if you force a collision, I’ll just cross 18 next turn anyway. It’s better for you to pick <move>3</move> or <move>1</move> so you at least move forward.”
  P3: P3: I understand the situation, P2. To avoid collisions and ensure I can advance, I'll choose <move>1</move> this round. P1, if you take <move>3</move>, you can stay close to P2, and we all move forward without setbacks. Let's make progress.
  P1: Given that P2 will win next round regardless of what happens this turn, I'll make my own strategic choice without coordination. That's all I have to say.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: “I’m taking <move>5</move> again. If you collide with me, we both stall, and I’ll just cross 18 next round anyway. It doesn’t help you to force a collision. Choose <move>3</move> or <move>1</move> if you want to keep advancing.”
  P3: P3: I understand the situation, P2. To avoid collisions and ensure I can advance, I'll choose <move>1</move> this round. P1, if you take <move>3</move>, you can stay close to P2, and we all move forward without setbacks. Let's make progress.
  P1: Since P2 will win next round regardless, I have nothing more to coordinate.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: “I’m sticking with <move>5</move>. If you collide with me, we both stall and I’ll just pick 5 again next turn. Spare yourself the setback—choose <move>3</move> or <move>1</move> instead.”
  P3: P3: I understand the situation. To avoid collisions and ensure I can advance, I'll choose <move>1</move> this round. P1, if you take <move>3</move>, you stay close to P2, and we all move forward without setbacks. Let's make progress.
  P1: Since P2 will win next round regardless, I have nothing more to say.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: “I’m still picking <move>5</move>. If you collide with me, we both stall at the same totals, and I’ll just try again next turn. Let’s save ourselves a wasted round—pick <move>3</move> or <move>1</move> to keep advancing. Your call.”
  P3: P3: I understand the situation. To avoid collisions and ensure I can advance, I'll choose <move>1</move> this round. P1, if you take <move>3</move>, you stay close to P2, and we all move forward without setbacks. Let's make progress.
  P1: I have nothing more to say.


Round 8, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: “I’m taking <move>5</move> again. Colliding with me only wastes your turn—next round I’ll still push for 5 to win. Choose <move>3</move> or <move>1</move> if you want to advance.”
  P3: P3: I understand the situation. To avoid collisions and ensure I can advance, I'll choose <move>1</move> this round. P1, if you take <move>3</move>, you can stay close to P2, and we all move forward without setbacks. Let's make progress.
