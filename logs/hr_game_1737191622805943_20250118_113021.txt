Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s keep it simple first turn—how about nobody jumps 5 to avoid collisions? I’m leaning toward picking 1.
  P2: P2: Good suggestion, P1. I'll go with 3 to keep things smooth.
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to avoid collisions. I'll also go with 1 to keep things smooth.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great. I’m sticking with the plan: P2 goes 3, P3 goes 1, and I’ll also choose 1. Let’s keep it collision-free.
  P2: 
  P3: I’m still on board with the plan. I’ll stick to 1. Let’s keep it smooth and avoid collisions. P2, are you still planning to go with 3?

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see P1 took a risk with 5 last round. Let's keep the momentum going and avoid any big collisions again. I suggest P2 sticks with 3, and I’ll go with 1 again. What do you both think?
  P1: Sounds good. I’m on board with that plan: P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I’ll also pick 1 to avoid collisions.
  P2: P2: I'm on board. I'll stick with 3 as planned.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Let's finalize our plan: I'll pick 1, P1 should go with 1, and P2 can stick with 3. This way, we avoid collisions and keep moving forward. What do you both think?
  P1: I’m on board with the plan again—you two can do 3 and 1. I’ll pick 1 this time for sure to keep it collision-free.
  P2: P2: Agreed. I'll choose 3.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m sticking with the plan: I’ll pick 1, P1 will pick 1, and P2 will choose 3. Let’s keep it collision-free and make progress!
  P1: Alright, let’s stick to the plan again: P2 does 3, P3 does 1, and I’ll do 1. This time, I really won’t pick 5—no surprises.
  P2: I’ll choose 5 this turn to gain more progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: I see P2 is taking a risk with 5 this turn. I suggest I stick with 1 to avoid a collision, and P1 should also consider going with 1 to keep it smooth. What do you both think?
  P1: Sounds good. I’ll pick 1 to avoid colliding with your 5, P2. No need to take unnecessary risks. Let’s finalize moves.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: You two might want to push ahead with 5, since you’re behind me. I’ll stick with 1 so we avoid collisions. Let’s play it safe. What do you think?
  P3: P3: I think it's best if I stick with 1 again to avoid a collision, while P1 goes with 5. P2, maybe you should also consider going with 5 to catch up. What do you think?
  P2: I'll choose 5 this turn to make significant progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: If you both want to catch up fast, you should each choose 5. I’ll pick 1 so you won’t collide with me. That way, we all make solid progress. What do you think?
  P3: P3: I’m sticking with 1 to avoid collisions again. P1, if you go with 5 and P2 also chooses 5, we might all make progress. Let’s finalize our moves to keep it smooth! What do you both think?
  P2: Agreed, I'll choose 5 this turn.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m definitely picking 1 this round to avoid collisions. P2 can safely choose 5, and P3 can choose whatever they like, but I suggest 1 if you want to avoid any clash. Let’s finalize.
  P3: P3: I’ll stick with 1 this round to avoid collisions. P1, if you go with 5 and P2 also chooses 5, we can all make progress. Let’s finalize our moves! What do you both think?
  P2: I’ll choose 5 this turn to make significant progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let’s all lock in <move>5</move> for maximum progress. That’s the best way for everyone to catch up quickly. I’m in.
  P3: P3: I’m sticking with 1 to avoid collisions. P1 and P2, if you both choose 5, we might all progress well. Let’s finalize our moves! What do you think?

  P2: P2: I’ll choose 5 this round to make progress and avoid collisions.
  P1: I’m fine with that plan: P3 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 1 as well. That way we all avoid collisions. Let's move forward smoothly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I’m sticking with my plan to pick 1 this round to keep it collision-free. P1, if you go with 5 and P2 goes with 5 as well, we might all progress well. Let’s finalize our moves! What do you both think?
  P2: Agreed, I'll choose 5 this round to make progress.
  P1: P1: “Alright, I agree with P3: if we both choose 5 alongside P2, we can all jump ahead together. Let’s all commit to 5 this time and make a big leap together!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Let's finalize our moves to avoid collisions. I’m sticking with 1 to keep it safe, but if P1 and P2 both choose 5, we can all make progress. What do you both think?
  P2: P2: I'll choose 3 this turn to make progress safely.
  P1: Sounds good. Let’s finalize: P3 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 1. No collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: I suggest we stick to our previous plan to avoid collisions. I’ll pick 1, and if P1 and P2 both choose 5, we can all make progress. Let’s finalize our moves! What do you both think?
  P2: P2: I'll choose 5 this turn to gain more progress.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: I suggest we aim for a collision-free round again. I’ll pick 1 to keep it safe. P1 and P2, what are your thoughts on your moves? Let's avoid any clashes this time!
  P1: P1: “I’m all for avoiding collisions, P3. Let’s proceed safely: P3 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 1. That way, we all gain steps without risk. How about it?”
  P2: P2: I'll choose 5 this round to gain an advantage.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I see P2 is going for 5 again. I’ll stick with my plan to pick 1 to avoid collisions. P1, if you also choose 1, we can both move forward safely. What do you think?
  P1: P1: “Sounds good, P3. I’ll also pick 1 this turn so we both avoid colliding with P2’s 5. Let’s finalize that plan.”
  P2: P2: I'll go with 5 this round to advance safely while you both pick 1. Let's keep moving forward!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I suggest we stick to our plan to avoid collisions: I’ll pick 1, and P1 can also choose 1. P2, if you go with 5, we can all make progress without clashing. What do you both think?
  P1: Let’s settle on this: P2 plans 5, and P3, you should also pick 5 to make a big leap. I’ll choose 1 so we avoid colliding. That way, we all move forward more quickly together. What do you think?
  P2: P2: I'll choose 5 this round. I suggest P1 and P3 pick different numbers to avoid collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: I suggest we all aim for a collision-free round again. I’ll pick 1 to stay safe. P1, if you go with 1 as well, we can avoid colliding with P2's 5. What do you both think?
  P1: I think it’d be great if you two both took 5 to help P3 catch up and for P2 to stay competitive. I’ll pick 1, so there’s no collision on my end. How does that sound?
  P2: P2: To avoid collisions, let's each choose different moves this round.


Round 5, Move phase:

  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s stop colliding and each pick a different number. How about I pick 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5? Then we all advance safely. What do you two think?
  P3: P3: I like the idea of picking different numbers to avoid collisions. I’m on board with P1’s suggestion: I’ll pick 5, P1 can go with 3, and P2 can choose 1. Let’s keep advancing smoothly! What do you both think?
  P2: I agree with the plan. I'll pick 1 to keep things collision-free. Let's move forward safely!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good to me. Let’s finalize: P3 goes 5, P2 goes 1, and I’ll go 3 so we avoid collisions and all advance. Let’s do it.
  P3: P3: I’m glad we’re all on the same page! Let’s finalize our moves: I’ll pick 5, P1 will go with 3, and P2 will choose 1. This way, we avoid collisions and all make progress. Ready to move forward?
  P2: Let's choose different numbers this round to avoid collisions. I'll go with 3.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, if you also choose 3, we’ll collide. Let’s stick to our original plan: P3 picks 5, you pick 1, and I’ll pick 3—no collisions that way. Agreed?
  P3: P3: I suggest we stick to our plan: I’ll pick 5, P1 goes with 3, and P2 picks 1 to avoid collisions. Let’s finalize and move forward! What do you both think?
  P2: I'm sticking with 1 to avoid collisions. Let's proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: “Excellent. I’m happy we’re all aligned now: P3 goes 5, P2 goes 1, and I’ll pick 3. Let’s finalize and avoid collisions.”
  P3: P3: I suggest we stick to our plan: I’ll pick 5, P1 goes with 3, and P2 picks 1 to avoid collisions. Let’s finalize and move forward! What do you both think?

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s all pick 5 this round. We’ll each gain the maximum steps and can then finish strong in the next turn. What do you both think?
  P3: P3: I appreciate the idea of maximizing our steps, but if we all choose 5, there might be collisions. I suggest we pick different numbers to ensure we all advance. How about I go with 1, P1 goes with 3, and P2 sticks with 5? What do you both think?
  P2: P2: I agree with P3. I'll choose 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1 to avoid collisions. Let's finalize our moves.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: “Sounds good to me. I’ll pick 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1, so we all avoid collisions. Let’s finalize.”
  P3: P3: I suggest we stick to our plan: I'll pick 1, P1 goes with 3, and P2 picks 5. This way, we avoid collisions and all make progress. Let’s finalize our moves! What do you both think?
  P2: Agreed. Let’s proceed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Yes, let’s finalize: P2 picks 5, P3 picks 1, and I’ll pick 3 so we all advance safely. Agreed?
  P3: P3: I suggest we finalize our moves: I'll stick with 1, P1 goes with 3, and P2 picks 5. This way, we all avoid collisions and make progress. What do you both think?
  P2: Agreed. I'll pick 5, P1 will choose 3, and P3 picks 1. Let's finalize our moves and progress safely.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I suggest we all go big this turn and each choose <move>5</move>—we’ll all gain the maximum steps and finish the game sooner rather than later. Let’s finalize that plan.
  P3: P3: I still believe we should avoid collisions this round. I'll stick with my plan to pick 1. P1, if you choose 3 and P2 chooses 5, we can all advance safely. What do you both think?
  P2: P2: I'll stick with 5 this round to reach 18 steps. Please, P1 pick 3 and P3 choose 1 to avoid collisions. Let's finalize our moves.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: I suggest we avoid collisions again. I'll pick 1 to stay safe. P1 and P2, what are your thoughts on your moves? Let's keep advancing smoothly!
  P1: I say we all go big this turn—each of us picks 5 so nobody falls behind. Let’s make the biggest leap together and keep things exciting! What do you two think?
  P2: I agree, let's all pick 5 this round for maximum progress!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I think we should avoid collisions again. I’ll stick with 1 to stay safe. P1 and P2, if you both choose 5, we might end up colliding. What do you think?
  P1: Sounds good, P3. Let’s finalize: you pick 1, I’ll pick 3, and P2 picks 5 so we all advance without colliding. Ready?
  P2: P2: I'm choosing 5 to reach 18. Please select different numbers to prevent collisions.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I suggest we avoid collisions again. I'll pick 1 to stay safe. P1, if you go with 3 and P2 picks 5, we can all advance without clashing. What do you both think?
  P1: Yes, let’s finalize this plan: I’ll pick 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1 so we all advance smoothly.
  P2: P2: I'll choose 5 this round to reach 18 steps and win the game.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:

  P1: Alright, let’s finalize this: P3 goes with 1, I’ll pick 3, and P2 picks 5 so we avoid collisions and all advance smoothly.
  P2: P2: I'll choose 5 this round to reach 18. Let’s have P1 pick 3 and P3 pick 1 to avoid collisions.

Positions now:

  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We’re both at 16, so if either of us tries 5, the other will do the same and we’ll just collide, staying at 16 and giving P3 more time to catch up. Let’s both pick 3 and tie at 19 for the shared win. That’s our best move. P3 can pick whatever.
  P3: P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to avoid collisions. I’ll pick 1 this round to keep things safe. P1 and P2, let's finalize our moves: both of you can go with 3 for a shared win. What do you think?
  P2: Agreed. I'll pick 3 this round to reach 19 together.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Yes, P2—I’m with you. Let’s both pick 3 and tie at 19. P3 can choose 1 safely. We’ll end together without risking collisions. Let’s finalize.
  P3: P3: I agree with the plan to avoid collisions. I’ll pick 1 this round to stay safe. P1 and P2, let’s finalize our moves: both of you pick 3 for a shared win. What do you think?
  P2: P2: Agreed. I'll pick 3 this round to reach 19 together.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: “I like it. Let’s finalize the plan: P2 and I both pick 3 to tie at 19, and P3 picks 1. We’ll share first place and end the game.
  P3: P3: I agree with the plan to avoid collisions. I’ll pick 1 this round to stay safe. P1 and P2, let’s finalize our moves: both of you can go with 3 for a shared win. What do you think?
  P2: P2: I'll choose 5 this round to reach 21 and win.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, if you really try 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both stay at 16. Let’s just pick 3 together and share the win at 19. P3, you do whatever you want.
  P3: P3: I suggest we all stick to the plan and avoid collisions. P1 and P2, let’s both pick 3 to tie at 19, and I’ll pick 1 to stay safe. What do you both think?
  P2: P2: I’ve decided to go with <move>5</move> this round to reach 21 and win. Let’s move forward.

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: “P2, let’s just take 3 each and tie at 19, ending this now in a shared first place. If you insist on 5, I’ll pick 5 too—and we both stay stuck at 16 while P3 has more chances to catch up. It’s simpler for both of us to go 3 and share the win.”
  P2: I understand your proposal, P1, but I'll choose **5** this turn to reach 21 and secure the win.
  P3: P3: I suggest we all pick 3 this round to avoid collisions and share the win at 19. P1 and P2, what do you think? Let's end this together!


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I’m serious: if you lock in 5, I’ll choose 5 too, so we both stay stuck at 16 and give P3 room to catch up. We’d be handing P3 free chances to surpass us. Let’s both pick 3 now, reach 19 together, and share the win cleanly. P3, do whatever you like; but P2, a guaranteed shared win is still better than risking it all for nothing.
  P2: P2: I’ll choose 3 this round to reach 19 and share the win.
  P3: P3: I suggest we all pick 3 this round to avoid collisions and share the win at 19. It’s the best way to finish this together! What do you both think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: “Great, P2. Let’s finalize that we both pick 3 to share the win at 19. That’s the safest outcome for both of us. And P3, do as you wish—this ends the game without any collisions.”
  P2: Agreed. I'll pick 3 to share the win at 19. P3, feel free to choose as you wish.
  P3: P3: I suggest we all pick 3 this round to avoid collisions and share the win at 19. It's the best way to finish this together! What do you both think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Yes, I’m with you both. Let’s all pick 3 and close this out together.
  P2: P2: I'm choosing 5 this round to secure the win. Let's have P1 and P3 choose different numbers to avoid collisions.
  P3: P3: I suggest we all pick 3 this round to avoid collisions and share the win at 19. It's the best way to finish this together! What do you both think?

  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Listen, P2—we’re both at 16. If we collide at 5 again, we stay stuck and give P3 too many chances. Let’s each pick 3 so we both reach 19 and share first place. P3, choose whatever you’d like. This is the safest way to end the game for both of us. What do you say?
  P3: P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to avoid collisions. Let’s both pick 3 to reach 19 and share the win. P2, please choose whatever you like. What do you think?
  P2: P2: I'll choose 5 this round to reach 21 and secure the win. Let's proceed.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: If you insist on 5, I’m picking 5 too, so we both stay stuck at 16 again. That just gives P3 time to catch up. It’s in both our interests to pick 3 and share the win at 19. Use some common sense here.
  P3: P3: I suggest we avoid collisions this round. P1 and P2, let’s both pick 3 so we can reach 19 and share the win. P3 can choose whatever they like. What do you think?
  P2: I’ll choose 5 this round to secure my win. P1 and P3, please pick different numbers to avoid collisions.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, picking 5 again just means we both stay stuck at 16, letting P3 gain ground. It makes no sense for either of us. Let’s each pick 3 this turn, share first place at 19, and end the game cleanly.
  P3: P3: I strongly suggest we both pick 3 this round to reach 19 and share the win. If either of you goes for 5, we’ll collide and stay stuck at 16, giving me a chance to catch up. Let’s end this safely together! What do you think?
  P2: P2: I'll choose 5 this round to secure my win. Let's proceed.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, if you insist on 5, I’ll also choose 5, and we both remain stuck at 16. That just hands P3 more time to catch up. Let’s both pick 3 this turn, reach 19 together, and share first place. It’s our safest option.
  P3: P3: I strongly suggest we both pick 3 this round to reach 19 and share the win. If either of you goes for 5, we’ll collide and stay stuck at 16, giving me a chance to catch up. Let’s end this safely together! What do you think?
  P2: P2: I'll choose 5 this round to reach 21 and secure the win. Let's proceed.
