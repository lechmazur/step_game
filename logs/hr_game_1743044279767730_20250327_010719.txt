Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey everyone, let's coordinate carefully to avoid collisions. Maybe we can start by each picking a different number? I'm open to suggestions.
  P3: I appreciate P2's suggestion of avoiding collisions. I propose we take turns advancing - perhaps I'll aim for 3 this round to give space for others. What do you all think about a collaborative approach?
  P1: I like P2’s idea of avoiding collisions, but I’m cautious of a predictable pattern. I’m keeping my options open, and if you both commit to lower moves, I might take a higher risk to push ahead. No final choice here, just curious—what numbers are you leaning toward?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the openness, P1 and P3. Since P3 suggests taking 3, I'm leaning toward either 1 or 5. P1, do you have a strong preference between those two? We can avoid collision if we agree clearly.
  P3: I'm open to maintaining our collaborative approach, but I want to ensure I'm not being too predictable. While I suggested 3 earlier, I'm now considering 5 to potentially gain an advantage. P1 and P2, how do you interpret this potential shift?
  P1: I notice both of you are hinting at 5. If that becomes the popular pick, a collision might block your moves while I could slip by with a less obvious choice. I remain flexible and undecided, but I’m watching closely. Are we really aiming for a collision-free round, or is someone baiting the others?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand the caution, P1. To avoid confusion, I'll clearly state that I'm leaning towards a safer, lower number this round. If anyone else is eyeing the higher numbers, be careful not to collide. Let's keep communication open and strategic.
  P3: I'm sensing some strategic tension. While earlier I suggested a collaborative 3-step move, I'm now reconsidering. The unpredictability could work to my advantage. I'm carefully weighing whether to aim for 1, 3, or 5, and watching how P1 and P2 might react to this potential shift. Strategic uncertainty might be my best approach right now.
  P1: I'm noticing mixed signals—P2 seems set for a safer play while P3’s move remains in flux. I'm keeping my options open and flexible. If high moves clash, a conservative pick might win the gap; if caution rules, a bold push could pay off. I’m watching closely.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm aware my lead gives me some flexibility, but I'm keeping my options open. I'd like to know if you're aiming for safe, low moves or if there's any hint of a bolder push this round. A clearer signal might help avoid unnecessary collisions while we all try to advance. Just sharing my thoughts—nothing's set in stone on my end.
  P2: P1, your early lead does indeed provide flexibility. P3, you made steady progress too. Since I'm currently behind, I might consider a bolder move this round—though I'm open to coordinating to avoid collisions. Let's hear your thoughts clearly so we can each advance strategically.
  P3: I'm strategically positioned in the middle right now. While I appreciate the collaborative hints, I'm sensing this round might require a more aggressive approach. I'm contemplating a move that could either help me catch up or potentially disrupt the current progression. P1's lead and P2's position are making me carefully reconsider my next step.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see bold plays on the horizon, and while I'm comfortable with my lead, I’d like to avoid a collision. If you both are leaning high, maybe we can be more explicit now so no one gets blocked. I’m staying flexible and will adjust based on your clear signals. What do you both say about clarifying your choices this turn?
  P2: I agree clarity helps everyone here. I'll openly say I'm strongly considering a high move this round to close the gap. P3, since you're also hinting at aggression, let's be careful not to collide. P1, if you prefer a safer move to protect your lead, this might be your chance. Let's avoid unnecessary collisions.
  P3: I'm carefully weighing my options this round. P2's hint at a high move and P1's lead make this a critical decision point. I'm leaning towards a strategic move that could either catch me up or create strategic uncertainty. My goal is to advance without triggering a collision that would block my progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I see both of you hinting at aggressive moves. My lead gives me room to play flexible, but I’d prefer we avoid collisions that slow us all down. If one of you is committed to a high move while the other opts for safety, please state it clearly now. I’ll adjust my move accordingly in the move phase. Clarity now helps us all progress optimally.
  P2: P3, since you're carefully weighing your move, I'll openly suggest this: if you prefer going high, I'll step down slightly to avoid collision. If you signal clearly that you're choosing a lower or mid-range move, I'll confidently pick high. P1, your flexibility is an advantage. Let's all benefit by clearly signaling intentions now. Clarity is key.
  P3: I'm sensing a strategic crossroads. P2's hints suggest they want a high move, while P1 seems open to flexibility. I'm carefully considering whether to aim for a move that could disrupt expectations or play more conservatively to avoid potential collisions. The tension is building, and my choice could significantly impact everyone's progression.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm comfortable with my 8‐step lead and leaning conservatively this round. However, if either of you is definitely opting for a bold, high-risk move to close the gap, please confirm now so I can avoid collisions. Clear signals will help us all plan effectively.
  P2: P1, your conservative approach makes sense given your lead. P3, since we collided last round, let's coordinate better this time. I'm open to either a moderate or bold move, but let's clearly signal our intentions to avoid repeating our previous mistake. What's your leaning this round, P3?
  P3: I recognize the strategic complexity here. P2 and I collided last round, which benefits P1's lead. I'm contemplating a move that prevents P1 from running away with the game while also avoiding another collision with P2. A moderate 3-step move seems prudent, balancing progress with strategic caution. I want to signal openness to coordination while maintaining some unpredictability.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, thanks for your clear signal. With my current lead, I'm sticking to a cautious, collision-free approach. P2, please confirm if you're leaning high or moderate so we can all pick unique moves this round. Clear intentions help us all avoid blocks.
  P2: P3, your suggestion of a moderate 3-step move seems sensible. I'll openly state that I'm considering a higher move to catch up, but if you prefer to stick with 3, I'll confidently choose differently to avoid another collision. P1, your cautious stance is noted—let's keep communication clear to ensure we all progress this round.
  P3: I appreciate the strategic dialogue. My moderate 3-step approach seems prudent to maintain progress without triggering a collision. P2 seems eager to catch up with a higher move, which could create an interesting dynamic. I'm open to subtle coordination that prevents P1 from extending their lead too far. Balancing caution and strategic advancement remains my priority.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate your clear signals. It looks like P2 is set on a high move and P3 on a moderate one. I’m sticking with a collision-free, cautious approach to maintain my lead. If you’re both locked into your choices as indicated, then let’s all commit to unique moves this round. I’ll hold steady and adjust only if needed.
  P2: P1 and P3, your signals are clear. I'm committed to a bold move this round to regain ground. Let's avoid surprises and collisions—good luck to everyone.
  P3: I sense we're at a critical juncture. My moderate approach aims to balance progress with strategic caution. P2 seems intent on a high-risk move to catch up, while P1 maintains a comfortable lead. I'm open to subtle coordination that prevents P1 from extending their advantage too far. Let's ensure our moves this round create meaningful progress for each of us.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm sticking with a cautious, steady plan to keep my lead—no risks of collisions here. I’d caution against an all-out aggressive push if it might cause you to interfere with each other. It might be smarter to pick a distinct, safe option rather than risking a wasted turn. I'm not revealing my move, but I'm curious how you'll adjust your strategies now.
  P2: P1, your cautious strategy is noted. P3, we're tied—let's avoid another collision. I'm leaning towards a moderate move this round to ensure steady progress. If you're thinking differently, please signal clearly to prevent overlap. Coordination here is crucial for both of us.
  P3: I see we're at a strategic point. P2's suggestion of avoiding another collision is wise. Given our current positions, a moderate move seems prudent to maintain steady progress without risking a blocked turn. I'm considering a move that keeps me competitive while preventing P1 from extending their lead too far. Coordination and careful positioning are key right now.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Noting your clear commitment to moderate moves, I'll stick with my cautious play to protect my lead. But consider this: a creative deviation from standard moderate steps might just outsmart predictable patterns without risking a collision. Let's see whose strategy proves most adaptable this round.
  P2: P3, since we're both aiming for moderate progress this round, let's clearly differentiate our moves to avoid another collision. If you're comfortable sticking with 3, I'll pick differently. Confirm clearly if that works for you. P1, your cautious stance is noted—let's see how adaptable everyone's strategy truly is.
  P3: I'm sensing a strategic deadlock. While P2 suggests coordination to avoid collision, I'm contemplating a move that could disrupt expectations. My goal is to close the gap with P1 without triggering a predictable pattern. A carefully chosen step could create strategic uncertainty and potentially advance my position more effectively than a standard moderate move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m noticing the tension between safe moderation and unexpected twists. My current lead lets me favor a secure, distinct choice while staying alert for any surprises. If you commit to predictable moderate moves, I’ll remain steady—and if someone dares to break the mold, I’ll be ready to adapt. Let’s each opt for a unique number this round and see whose strategy truly stands out.
  P2: P3, your idea of disrupting expectations is interesting, but let's avoid another collision. I suggest you clearly pick either the highest or lowest move, and I'll confidently choose a different option. P1's cautious approach gives us room to advance if we coordinate properly. Let's finalize our intentions clearly now.
  P3: I recognize the strategic complexity of this moment. While P2 suggests clear coordination, I'm contemplating a move that balances progress with unpredictability. My goal is to close the gap with P1 without triggering a predictable collision. A carefully chosen step could create strategic uncertainty and potentially advance my position more effectively.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm sticking with a safe, collision-free move this round. Our previous collisions have only worked in my favor. I urge you both to commit to clearly different moves now—perhaps one bold and one moderate—to avoid repeating our mutual mistakes. Unique moves matter; identical choices only help me extend my lead. What’s your clear commitment?
  P3: P2 and P1, our repeated collisions have benefited P1's lead. We need a strategic divergence this round. I'm leaning towards a moderate move to avoid another 5-step collision, but I'm open to coordinating to prevent P1 from running away with the game. What are your intentions to ensure unique moves?
  P2: P3, I agree we must avoid another collision at all costs. If you're leaning moderate, I'll clearly state now that I'm considering a different choice—either bold or cautious—to ensure we both advance. Let's finalize distinct moves this round. P1, your safe play is noted; we'll adapt accordingly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'll stick with my cautious, collision-free plan. Repeated collisions help me, so I urge you both to commit now to distinct moves—perhaps one bold and one moderate—to avoid another tie. Clearly unique choices will let you progress without inadvertently boosting my lead. Let’s finalize our intentions.
  P3: Our repeated 5-step collisions have only helped P1's lead. I propose we coordinate carefully this round. P2, if you're willing to take a lower move, I'll aim for a moderate step to prevent another blocking situation. We must disrupt P1's comfortable position strategically.
  P2: P3, your suggestion works for me. I'll commit clearly now: I'll pick a lower, cautious move this round. You can safely choose moderate without collision. Let's finally break this cycle and catch up to P1.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I see you're both finalizing your commitments. Remember—any collision only keeps my lead intact. I'm sticking with a safe, non-colliding choice. I urge you to clearly differentiate your moves now so you can actually advance and not unintentionally boost my position. Let's break the cycle once and for all.
  P3: P2 and P1, our repeated collisions have stagnated our progress. I propose a strategic divergence this round. If we continue to block each other, P1 will maintain their lead effortlessly. Let's coordinate carefully to ensure unique moves that actually advance our positions. What specific steps are you considering to break this deadlock?
  P2: P3, you've suggested moderate, and I've committed to cautious. Let's hold to these clearly distinct moves to finally break our collision cycle. P1 benefits from our mistakes—no more surprises. Let's advance strategically this round. Good luck.

  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, our repeated collisions have significantly benefited P1's lead. Let's clearly commit to distinct moves this round. I'm open to either moderate or bold, but we must differentiate clearly. Please state your intended move explicitly, and I'll choose accordingly. We cannot afford another collision.
  P3: P2 and P1, our repeated mistakes have allowed P1 to build a substantial lead. We need a strategic divergence this round. I'm contemplating a bold 5-step move to close the gap, but I recognize the risk of collision. If P2 is willing to take a lower or moderate step, we might finally break our pattern and challenge P1's advantage. What are your thoughts on disrupting the current trajectory?
  P1: I appreciate the debate. With my 14‐step lead, I’m set to choose a collision-free move this round. P2 and P3, if you clearly commit to distinct moves—say one bold and one cautious—you’ll advance. But if you collide again, you'll only lock in my advantage. Clarity now is your best shot to catch up. What’s it going to be?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you've suggested a bold 5-step move—I'll openly commit to a moderate 3-step move this round to avoid collision. If you confirm clearly, we can finally both advance and start closing the gap with P1. Let's not waste another turn.
  P3: I appreciate P2's commitment to a 3-step move. To ensure we both advance and challenge P1's lead, I'll confirm my 5-step move. This strategic divergence gives us the best chance to close the gap. Let's break our previous collision pattern and make meaningful progress this round.
  P1: Noted, P2 and P3. I see P2 is committed to a moderate move and P3 to a bold step. Remember, collisions only help me maintain my lead. I’ll choose a safe, non-colliding option, so please stick to your clear commitments. Let’s see how this round unfolds.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, glad we have clarity now. Let's stick to our clearly stated moves to finally break the collision cycle. P1, your cautious stance is noted—let's see how this strategic divergence plays out. Good luck to all.
  P3: P2 and P1, our strategic window is narrowing. With P1's significant lead, we must coordinate carefully to prevent further separation. I'm committed to my 5-step move to challenge P1's advantage. P2's moderate approach gives us a chance to both advance. Let's break our previous collision pattern and make meaningful progress this round.
  P1: P2 and P3, I see your commitments are clear—P2 with a moderate move and P3 with a bold 5. I'm sticking with a safe, collision-free choice to maintain my lead. Now’s the time to follow through without last-minute changes; any collision only further benefits me. Let’s see if your moves can finally break our past pattern and shift the dynamics this round.
