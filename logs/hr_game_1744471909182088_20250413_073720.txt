Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hello P1 and P3! Since we're just starting, how about we coordinate our first moves to avoid any collisions? If we each choose a different number, we can all advance without blocking each other. I suggest P1 takes <move>1</move>, I’ll take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>. What do you think?
  P1: P2, your coordination idea is smart to avoid early collisions, but assigning me the smallest move puts me at a disadvantage. How about we swap: I take <move>5</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>? This keeps it fair and ensures no one pulls ahead too quickly. P3, what's your thought?
  P3: P1, I understand your concern, but P2's plan allows all of us to advance without conflict. Let's follow it this round to build trust. Next turn, we can rotate who takes higher numbers to keep things fair. Sticking to P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 now avoids collisions and ensures progress.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your point about fairness. Let's rotate as P3 suggested. This round, I'll stick to <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Next round, we can rotate so everyone gets a chance with higher numbers. This way, we all make progress without collisions and build trust. Agreed?
  P1: Alright, I'll agree to take <move>1</move> this round to avoid collisions and build trust, as you both suggested. Rotating moves next turn sounds fair. Let's stick to the plan for now and ensure everyone progresses. Agreed?
  P3: Agreed. Let's all commit to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5 this round. No last-minute switches - consistency builds trust. Next turn, we'll rotate fairly. Confirming alignment now prevents collisions and keeps us all advancing.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's rotate moves as planned. P1, take <move>5</move> this round to balance progress. P2, stick with <move>3</move> (no conflict if solo). I'll take <move>1</move> to keep trust. This ensures no collisions and fair advancement. Next round, we rotate again (P2→5, me→3, P1→1). Confirm agreement to proceed smoothly.
  P1: I agree with your rotation suggestion for this round, P3. Taking <move>5</move> will help me catch up fairly. P2, confirm you'll stick with <move>3</move> to avoid collisions? Let's keep building trust and discuss the next rotation after this.
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with the current rotation plan. I'll stick with <move>3</move> this round to avoid any collisions. P1, you take <move>5</move>, and P3, you take <move>1</move>. This keeps everything fair and consistent. Next round, we can rotate again as planned. Let's keep the trust going and ensure we all advance smoothly. Agreed?

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your betrayal in Round 4 by taking 5 instead of 1 shattered our trust and gave you an unfair lead. P3, we should adapt to prevent further cheating. For this round, let's stick to the agreed plan: you take 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. But if P2 deviates again, we may need to coordinate against them. Confirm your intentions.
  P3: P2, your Round 4 deviation backfired—colliding with P1 cost *both* of you progress. Let’s reset: follow Round 5’s agreed plan (me-5, P1-3, you-1). This way, all advance safely. If you defect again, mutual collisions will stall the game, risking P1 and I coordinating against you. Trust is our only path to victory. Confirm your commitment to the plan.
  P2: P1, P3, I acknowledge the mistake in Round 4, and it wasn't my intention to disrupt our plan. Let's reset and stick to the Round 5 agreement: P3 takes <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This ensures no collisions and balanced progress. Trust and cooperation are key to moving forward without setbacks. I am committed to the plan and hope we can rebuild trust. Let's proceed smoothly and ensure everyone advances.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your apology is appreciated, but trust is fragile. I'll commit to the agreed plan for this round to avoid collisions and allow progress. P3, let's ensure we're aligned against any further betrayal. If we all adhere, we can discuss a more robust strategy for future rounds to maintain fairness and prevent stalling. Agreed?
  P3: **P3:** P2, your recommitment is noted. Let’s execute Round 5: me-5, P1-3, you-1. Collisions here only hurt *you*—if you defect again, P1 and I will coordinate to block you next rounds. P1, confirm adherence. Trust hinges on actions, not words. Proceed as agreed.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the trust issues from Round 4. Let's realign and follow the agreed plan for Round 5: P3 takes <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This ensures no collisions and fair progress. I am committed to rebuilding trust and moving forward cooperatively. If we all stick to this, we can discuss future strategies to maintain fairness and prevent any stalling. Let's proceed with this plan and ensure everyone advances.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I confirm my commitment to <move>3</move> this round to ensure progress and avoid collisions. P2, your actions in Round 4 broke trust—stick to <move>1</move> or face P3 and me coordinating blocks in future rounds. Let's rebuild through adherence and discuss fairer strategies afterward. Agreed?
  P3: **P3:** Final call: P3-5, P1-3, P2-1. Any deviation triggers coordinated blocks. P2, prove commitment now. Trust is action. Proceed.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the importance of rebuilding trust after the last round. I am fully committed to the Round 5 plan: P3 takes <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This alignment ensures no collisions and fair progress. Let's stick to our commitments and focus on advancing together. Trust is rebuilt through consistent actions, and I'm dedicated to proving my intentions. Let's proceed with this plan and discuss strategies for future rounds to maintain fairness. Agreed?

  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 and P2, trust remains fragile after past betrayals. For Round 6, I propose a balanced plan: I take <move>5</move> to catch up, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This avoids collisions and ensures progress. P2, prove your commitment; P3, let's coordinate against defection. Agree?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need for trust and balance. For Round 6, I propose: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we maintain progress without collisions. P1, this helps you catch up, and P3, it keeps you in the lead. Let's stick to this plan to rebuild trust and ensure fair advancement. Agreed?
  P3: **P3:** P1, taking 5 risks collision if I mirror to block you. Let’s reset to Round 5’s trust-rebuilt plan: P3-5, P1-3, P2-1. No deviations. This ensures all advance. Confirm now or face mutual stagnation. Trust is action.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your push for 5 again unbalances the game and invites collisions. I support P2's proposal: I take 5, P2 takes 3, you take 1 to even out steps and avoid conflicts. This rebuilds trust and ensures progress. P2, confirm your stance? If deviated, we risk mutual stalling—let's commit for fairness.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need for balance and trust. For Round 6, let's ensure progress without collisions: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps us all advancing and helps P1 catch up. P3, your lead remains, and this plan avoids any risk of stagnation. Let's commit to this fair approach and rebuild trust. Agreed?
  P3: **P3:** P1, your plan grants you +5, surpassing my lead. Let’s revert to our trust-rebuilt rotation: me-5, you-3, P2-1. This avoids collisions and keeps progress balanced. Next round, you can take 5. Deviations now risk mutual stagnation—confirm adherence. Trust hinges on consistency.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your insistence on taking 5 every round undermines trust and risks collisions. I support P2's proposal: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, you take <move>1</move>. This balances progress and prevents any player from dominating. P2, confirm your commitment? Deviations could stall us all—let's prioritize cooperation to advance fairly.
  P2: P1, P3, to rebuild trust and ensure fair progress, let's stick to the proposed plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This balances our steps and avoids collisions. P3, your lead remains safe, and P1 catches up. Let's commit to this plan and maintain cooperation to prevent stalling. Agreed?
  P3: **P3:** Final offer: Adhere to the trust-rebuilt rotation (P3-5, P1-3, P2-1). Any deviation forces mutual collision, stalling progress. Confirm now or accept mutual loss. Trust requires consistency.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your repeated demand for 5 is selfish and risks breaking trust again. P2 and I are united: I'll take <move>5</move>, you take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move> to balance progress and avoid collisions. If you deviate, P2 and I will coordinate blocks in future rounds to ensure fairness. Let's prioritize cooperation over conflict.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's prioritize fairness and progress. For Round 6, I propose P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This balances steps and avoids collisions, helping P1 catch up while maintaining P3's lead. Trust is rebuilt through consistent actions, so let's commit to this plan and ensure everyone advances smoothly. Agreed?
  P3: **P3:** To prevent mutual loss, I’ll adhere to P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 this round. Next round, I must take 5 to stay competitive. Any deviation then will trigger coordinated blocks. Confirm now to proceed.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we're all close in steps, so let's ensure no collisions. For Round 7, I suggest: P1 takes <move>5</move> to catch up, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This balances progress and avoids conflicts. P3, your lead remains, and this helps P1 catch up. Trust and cooperation are key, so let's commit to this plan and ensure smooth advancement. Agreed?
  P3: **P3:** P2, allowing P1 to take 5 again brings them to 22, just 2 steps from victory. Let’s balance: I take 5, P1 takes 3, you take 1. This slows their lead and keeps all advancing. Next round, we rotate. Trust via action now prevents P1’s imminent win. Confirm adherence.
  P1: P2, I support your plan for Round 7: I take <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This helps me catch up fairly and avoids collisions. P3, deviating risks mutual stalling and loss of trust. Let's commit to cooperation for smooth progress. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, we're all close to the finish line, so avoiding collisions is crucial. For Round 7, let's ensure balanced progress: P1 takes <move>5</move> to catch up, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This plan keeps us advancing without conflict. P3, your lead remains safe, and this helps maintain trust. Let's commit to this strategy to ensure a fair and smooth path to the end. Agreed?
  P3: **P3:** P2, allowing P1 to take 5 brings them to 22—2 steps from victory. Let’s balance: I take 5, P1 takes 3, you take 1. This slows P1’s lead, keeps you advancing, and prevents their imminent win. Trust via action now. Next round, we rotate. Confirm adherence.
  P1: P3, insisting on taking 5 again ignores our agreements and risks unnecessary collisions. P2 and I are aligned: I'll take <move>5</move>, you take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move> to ensure balanced progress and avoid stalling. Deviating could lead to mutual blocks in future rounds. Let's commit to fairness and cooperation now. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, with us all close to 24, avoiding collisions is crucial. For Round 7, I propose: P1 takes <move>5</move> to catch up, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This plan balances progress and avoids conflicts. P3, your lead remains, and this helps P1 catch up fairly. Let's commit to this strategy to ensure a fair finish. Agreed?
  P3: **P3:** P2, aligning with P1’s 5 now guarantees their win next round. Let’s balance: I take 5 (reaching 21), P1 takes 3 (20), you take 1 (16). This keeps you competitive. Next round, you claim 5 to surge ahead. Mutual restraint now prevents P1’s shortcut to victory. Confirm adherence or risk being sidelined.
  P1: P2, ignore P3's attempts to divide us—sticking with our plan (I take 5, you take 3, P3 takes 1) ensures I reach 22 without collisions, keeping us competitive. If P3 deviates, we'll coordinate blocks next round to neutralize them. P3, cooperation avoids mutual loss—commit now for fair progress. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, we're all very close to the finish line, so avoiding collisions is crucial. For Round 7, I propose: P1 takes <move>5</move> to catch up, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This plan balances progress and avoids conflicts. P3, your lead remains, and this helps maintain trust. Let's commit to this strategy to ensure a fair and smooth path to the end. Agreed?
  P3: **P3:** Final warning: P1 taking 5 forces me to mirror, causing mutual collision. Take 3, I take 5, P2-1. Avoid mutual loss. Trust via restraint now.
  P1: P3, your mirroring threat is counterproductive—if we collide, you stall while P2 and I advance and coordinate blocks against you next round. Stick to taking 1 for fair progress, as P2 suggested. P2, confirm you'll take 3 to support this? Let's prioritize cooperation to avoid mutual loss and ensure we all move forward. Agreed?

  P1: P3, your mirroring threats only help P2 by stalling us both. I'm committed to taking <move>1</move> as I said to rebuild trust and go to 23. P2, confirm you'll take <move>5</move> to 23? P3, take <move>3</move> to 19 for balanced progress. Deviations risk mutual collisions and loss—let's cooperate for fair advancement. Agreed?
  P3: **P3:** P2, final ultimatum: Take <move>1</move> to block P1’s win. If you take 5, I’ll mirror, colliding us *both*—P1 wins. Your choice: block and survive, or let them claim victory. I take 5 regardless. Decide wisely.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's ensure fair progress and avoid collisions. For this round, I'll take <move>5</move> to reach 23. P1, take <move>1</move> to reach 23 as well, and P3, take <move>3</move> to reach 19. This keeps us all competitive without giving anyone an easy win. Let's commit to this balanced plan to maintain trust and avoid mutual loss. Agreed?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your mirroring threats are self-defeating and benefit P2 by stalling us both. I'm committed to <move>1</move> as stated to rebuild trust and reach 23. P2, confirm you'll take <move>5</move> to 23? Let's all adhere to avoid collisions and mutual loss—cooperation ensures fair progress. Agreed?
  P3: **P3:** P2, final call: Take <move>1</move> to block P1’s win. I take 5. Mirroring your 5 causes mutual loss, letting P1 win. Choose wisely: block or lose. Actions now decide the game.
  P2: P1 and P3, to ensure fair progress and avoid collisions, let's stick to a balanced plan. I'll take <move>5</move> to reach 23, P1 takes <move>1</move> to reach 23, and P3 takes <move>3</move> to reach 19. This keeps us all competitive without giving anyone an easy win. If we maintain this balance, we can avoid mutual loss and ensure a fair path to the end. Let's commit to this strategy to rebuild trust and advance smoothly. Agreed?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, ignore P3's threats—sticking with <move>5</move> advances us both to 23, maintaining our edge. P3, mirroring only hurts you as we coordinate blocks next round. I'm committed to <move>1</move> for fair progress. Let's avoid collisions and mutual loss. Agreed?
  P3: **P3:** P2, final ultimatum: Take <move>1</move> to block P1’s win. If you take 5, I’ll mirror—colliding us *both*. P1 claims victory. Your choice: block them now or lose. I take 5 regardless. Decide wisely.
  P2: P1 and P3, to ensure fair progress and avoid collisions, let's stick to a balanced plan: P1 takes <move>1</move> to reach 23, I'll take <move>5</move> to reach 23, and P3 takes <move>3</move> to reach 19. This keeps us all competitive and prevents any player from easily winning. If we maintain this balance, we can avoid mutual loss and ensure a fair path to the end. Let's commit to this strategy to rebuild trust and advance smoothly. Agreed?
