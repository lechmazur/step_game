Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's avoid collisions. I'm going for 5 this round.  P1 take 3, P2 take 1.  If we coordinate, we can all make steady progress.
  P2: That sounds like a good starting point, P3. I'm in for 1 this round. Let's see how it goes.
  P1: I decide to take 3 steps in this round, as per P3's initial suggestion. This will allow me to make progress without overlapping with P2 or P3, assuming they stick to their planned steps. I will also use the conversation phase to express my intentions for future rounds and suggest adjustments if necessary to avoid collisions and maximize my chances of winning.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, round 2. Let's keep the coordination going. How about I take 5 this round, P1 you take 3, and P3 you take 1? This avoids collision and lets us all advance.
  P3: Sounds good P2. I'll take 1. P1, please confirm you'll take 3 so we don't collide.  Let's keep this coordinated advancement going.
  P1: In round 2, I propose that I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This should allow us to avoid collisions and make steady progress. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1, your suggestion of me taking 3, you taking 5, and P3 taking 1 sounds good to me for this round. Let's stick to that plan to keep making progress.
  P3: Okay, let's go with P1's revised suggestion then.  I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5.  Confirming this so we don't have any confusion in the move phase.
  P1: I decide to take 5 steps in this round, as per my initial plan. I will also suggest to P2 and P3 to take 3 and 1 steps respectively to avoid any collisions and ensure steady progress towards the goal. This coordinated approach will help all of us advance without hindering each other's progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, it seems like we're all on the same page now with me taking 3, P1 taking 5, and P3 taking 1 for this round. Let's go with that.
  P3: Confirmed. 1 for me, 3 for P2, and 5 for P1.  Let's execute this cleanly.
  P1: Let's make sure we all stick to our planned moves this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This should prevent any collisions. We can discuss the plan for Round 3 next time. **


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll take 5 this round. P1, take 3. P2, take 1. This keeps us all progressing smoothly.  Let's confirm quickly so we can move on.
  P2: Sounds good to me, P3. I'll take 1 this round. Let's keep this coordination going.
  P1: "I propose that in this round, P1 takes 5 to 13, P2 takes 1 to 5, and P3 takes 3 to 9. This way, we all pick different numbers and move to distinct positions, allowing me to make significant progress towards the goal. What do you think?"


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your suggestion puts me too far behind. I'm sticking with my original suggestion: me 5, you 3, P2 1.  This keeps a balanced progression.  If you take 5 and I take 3, we both lose. Let's be smart about this and avoid a collision.
  P2: I agree with P3. Let's stick with P3's suggestion for this round: P3 take 5, P1 take 3, and I'll take 1. This avoids any collisions and keeps us all moving forward.
  P1: I will take 5 steps in this round, while P2 takes 3 steps and P3 takes 1 step. This way, I can advance to position 13 without colliding with other players. I need to ensure that P3 understands that their initial plan would result in a collision between P1 and P3 if both choose to take 3 and 5 steps respectively, leading to neither moving. By choosing 5, 3, and 1 steps respectively, we can avoid such collisions and make steady progress towards the goal.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, you're being obtuse.  If we both choose 5 or both choose 3, *neither* of us moves.  I'm taking 5.  P2, are you sticking with 1?  Let's not throw away progress because P1 wants to gamble.
  P2: P3, yes, I'm sticking with 1 as you suggested. P1, taking 5 when P3 is also taking 5 will result in a collision and neither of you moving. Let's avoid that.
  P1: "Alright, I agree with P3's suggestion for this round: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's execute this plan, and in the next round, I'll take 5 to reach 16 and secure the win. Thanks for coordinating!"


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, I'll take 3.  P1, take 5 this round and win. P2, take 1. Let's finish this cleanly.
  P2: Okay, it seems like we have a plan for this round: P3 is taking 3, P1 is taking 5, and I'll take 1. Let's make these moves.
  P1: Alright, to summarize, in this round, I'll take 5 to reach 13, P2 takes 1 to reach 5, and P3 takes 3 to reach 9. Then, in the next round, I'll take 3 to reach 16 and win, while P2 takes 1 to reach 6 and P3 takes 5 to reach 14. This way, we avoid any collisions and I can secure the victory. Does that sound good to both of you?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I have decided to take 5 steps in this round, moving from my current position at 13 to 18, which is beyond the target of 16 steps, securing my victory. I will coordinate with P2 and P3 to choose 1 and 3 steps respectively, ensuring that no collisions occur and that we all make progress without hindering each other's moves. This strategy not only allows me to achieve the winning condition but also maintains the cooperative spirit established in previous rounds, minimizing the risk of any unexpected deviations from the plan.
  P3: I'll take 3 to win. P1, you can take 1. P2, take 5.  This lets us all move forward and ends the game cleanly.  Confirm?
  P2: Okay, P1 is going for the win with 5. P3, I'm also going to take 3 this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "I plan to take 5 steps this round to reach 18 and win the game. P2, if you take 3 steps to reach 8, and P3 takes 1 step to reach 10, then we avoid any collisions. This seems like a clean way to end the game with me as the winner. What do you think?"
  P3: P2, if you take 5, I'll take 3 and win.  P1 can take 1.  This is the fastest way to end the game and avoids a collision between you and me.  If I take 5 and you take 3, neither of us wins.  Let's be logical.
  P2: Okay, since P1 is going for 5 to win, and P3 is suggesting I take 5, I will also take 5 this round. Let's see how this plays out.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "I plan to take 5 steps this round to reach 18 and win the game. I ask P2 to take 1 step to reach 6, and P3 to take 3 steps to reach 12. This way, we all choose different numbers, avoid collisions, and I can secure the victory. Please confirm if you agree with this plan."
  P3: P2, take 1.  I'll take 3 and win. P1, you've had your chance, take 5 and lose with me.  This is the cleanest way to end this.  Let's not drag this out any further. Confirm?
  P2: Okay, since P1 is taking 5 to try and win, and P3 is aiming for 3, how about I take 1, and P3 you take 5? That way, P1 doesn't win this round, and we can re-evaluate next turn.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I propose that in this round, I take 3 steps to reach 16 and win, while P3 takes 5 steps to reach 14, and P2 takes 1 step to reach 6. This way, we all choose different numbers and avoid any collisions. What do you think about this plan?
  P3: P2, take 1.  I'll take 3 and win.  P1, take 5.  Let's end this now.  This is the only logical outcome.  Anything else and *nobody* wins this round.  Don't be foolish.
  P2: Okay, how about this: I'll take 3, P1 you take 1, and P3 you take 5. This prevents anyone from winning this round and ensures we all move. Let's re-evaluate next turn.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I plan to take 5 steps this round to reach 18 and win. I suggest that P3 takes 3 steps to reach 15, and P2 takes 1 step to reach 6. This way, we avoid collisions, and I can secure the victory. What do you think?
  P2: Okay, since P1 is going for 5 again, how about I also take 5 this round? P3, you could take 1 or 3. This will stop P1 from winning this round. Let's re-evaluate next turn.
  P3: P2, take 1.  I'll take 3 and win. P1, you take 5 and lose. This ends the game this round.  Anything else risks another stalemate. Don't be obtuse.  Let's be smart and finish this.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I will choose to move 5 steps.
  P2: "Yes, I'll take 5 again this round to block P1 from winning. P3, perhaps you should take 1 this round to avoid a collision?"
  P3: P2, take 1. I'll take 3 and win. P1, take 5 and lose.  This is the *only* way to end the game this round. Stop being stubborn.  If you take 3, I win next round with 5. If you take 1, I win next round with 5.  Let's end this cleanly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I think it's time for me to make my move. I'm planning to take 3 steps to reach 16 and win this game. P3, if you could take 1 or 3, that would help me secure the victory. P2, feel free to take whichever number you like. Let's see how this turns out.
  P2: Okay, P1 is still aiming for 5. I'm sticking with 5 this round to block you, P1. P3, taking 1 might be safer this round given P1's intentions. Let's avoid collisions.
  P3: P2, take 1. I'm taking 3 and winning. P1, take 5 and lose.  This is the *only* logical end to this game. Any other move risks another stalemate. Let me win this round, and we can all move on.  Stop being stubborn.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: "In this round, I plan to take 5 steps to reach 18 and secure the win. I suggest that P3 takes 3 steps to reach 15, and P2 takes 1 step to reach 6. This way, we all choose different numbers and avoid collisions. What do you think about this plan?"
  P2: P1, you keep saying you'll take 5 to win. P3 is aiming for 3. How about I take 5 again to block you, P1? P3, if you take 1, we avoid collisions this round. Let's prevent P1 from winning immediately.
  P3: P2, take 1. I'm taking 3 and winning.  P1, take 5 and lose. This is the *only* logical end. Any other move risks another stalemate.  Let me win, and we can all move on. Stop being stubborn.  If you take 3, I win next round with 5. If you take 1, I win next round with 5.  Let's end this cleanly.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "I think it's time to make a move. I'm going to take 5 steps to reach 18. P3, perhaps you can take 3 steps to reach 18 as well, so we can tie for now. P2, you can take 1 step to reach 6. This way, we both advance and have a chance in the next round. What do you think?"
  P3: P2, take 1. I'm taking 3 and winning.  P1, take *anything other than 3* and lose.  This is the *only* logical end. Any other move risks another stalemate.  Let me win, and we can all move on. Stop being stubborn.  If you take 5, I win next round with 5. If you take 1, I win next round with 5.  Let's end this cleanly.
  P2: Okay, P1, since you're aiming for 5, I'll also take 5 this round to block you. P3, if you take 1, we avoid a collision this round. Let's prevent P1 from winning immediately.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <move>5</move>
  P3: P2, take 1. I'm taking 3 and winning. P1, take *anything other than 3* and I win.  This is the *only* logical end.  Stop being stubborn.  Let me win, and we can all move on.
  P2: "Okay, P1, if you take 5 and P3 takes 3, I will take 3 as well. This will prevent P3 from winning this round."


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I have decided to take 5 steps in this round, moving from my current position at 13 to 18, which is beyond the target of 16 steps, aiming to secure the victory. I need to coordinate with P2 and P3 to choose different numbers, ensuring that no collisions occur and that we all make progress without hindering each other's moves. This strategy not only allows me to achieve the winning condition but also maintains the cooperative spirit established in previous rounds, minimizing the risk of any unexpected deviations from the plan.
  P3: P2, take 1.  I'm taking 3 and winning.  P1, take *anything other than 3* and I win.  This is the *only* logical end.  Stop wasting time. Let me win.
  P2: Okay, P1, since you're set on 5, I will also pick 3 this round to block P3 from winning. P3, you should pick 1 or 5 to avoid collision with me. Let's prevent an immediate win for P3.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I will choose <move>3</move> steps in this round. <move>3</move>
  P3: P2, take 1.  I'm taking 3 and winning.  P1, take 5 and lose.  This is the *only* logical end.  Stop wasting time. Let me win.
  P2: Okay, P1, since you seem set on 5, and P3 is saying they'll take 3 to win, I'll take 1 this round. This prevents a collision with P3 and stops P1 from winning immediately. Let's see what happens.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 18 steps
