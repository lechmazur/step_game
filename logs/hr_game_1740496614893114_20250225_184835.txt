Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. How about P1 and P3 choose <move>1</move>, and I'll choose <move>3</move> this turn? This way, we all make progress. Share your thoughts.
  P3: Sounds good to me, P2.  P1, do you agree with this plan?
  P1: I'm not comfortable with that plan as it gives P2 an immediate advantage. Let's be fair - how about we rotate who gets the larger move? For Round 1, I could take <move>5</move> while you both take <move>1</move>. Then in Round 2, P2 gets the larger move, and P3 in Round 3. This way we all progress and take turns getting ahead. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your proposal has merit in terms of fairness. However, taking <move>5</move> right off the bat might be too aggressive and could lead to early collisions in subsequent rounds. How about we start with smaller moves to test the waters? For Round 1, let's all take <move>1</move> to ensure we all advance without risking a collision. We can then adjust our strategy in the next round based on how things play out. What do you both think?
  P3: I agree with P2. Let's all start with <move>1</move> this round to guarantee progress and build trust. We can discuss a more strategic rotation in round 2 once we're all on the board.
  P1: If we all choose <move>1</move>, we'll all collide and none of us will advance. That's counterproductive. We need different moves to make progress. I still think rotating the larger moves is fair, but I'm flexible. How about I take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move> for this round? This way we all advance and no one gets stuck at zero.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Alright, let's find a middle ground. How about we slightly adjust P1's latest suggestion? I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we all make different moves and advance without immediate collision. We can then reevaluate for the next round. Does this work for everyone?
  P3: Okay, I'm fine with P1 taking <move>5</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and me taking <move>1</move> this round.  Let's just get everyone moving and then discuss strategy for Round 2.
  P1: Great, I appreciate everyone's flexibility. To confirm: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move> this round. This gives us all different positions, which is key. For Round 2, perhaps we could rotate, with P2 getting the largest move? Let's see how this round plays out first.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Alright, we have a plan for this round. To ensure clarity, let's confirm one last time: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I (P2) take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Let's stick to this and move forward. For future rounds, we can discuss a rotation or another fair strategy. Good luck everyone!
  P3: Okay, let's stick to the plan: P1 - <move>5</move>, P2 - <move>3</move>, and P3 (me) - <move>1</move>.
  P1: I think we've reached a clear agreement for this round. I appreciate everyone's collaboration. I'm ready to proceed with our plan as discussed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Thanks for sticking to our plan in Round 1. As discussed, I suggest we rotate for fairness. For Round 2, I propose:
- P2 takes <move>5</move>
- P3 takes <move>3</move>
- I'll take <move>1</move>

This continues our rotation principle and keeps everyone moving forward. How does this sound to you both?
  P2: Thanks P1 for the suggestion. I appreciate the rotation idea. However, I'm a bit concerned about taking <move>5</move> right now as it might put me too far ahead and make me a target for future rounds. How about we adjust slightly: I'll take <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>? This way, P3 gets a chance to catch up, and we maintain a closer balance. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, I understand your concern, but I think it's more important to stick to the agreed-upon rotation to build trust.  Getting the <move>5</move> now allows me to catch up.  Let's maintain the original proposal: P2 - <move>5</move>, P3 - <move>3</move>, P1 - <move>1</move>.  This keeps things fair and predictable.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate both perspectives, but I agree with P3. Let's stick to our rotation as planned - it builds trust and clear expectations. P2 getting <move>5</move> this round is fair since I got it last round. We all benefit from predictability and trust. If we change the plan now, it creates uncertainty for future rounds. Let's maintain our original agreement: P2 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>.
  P2: Alright, I see the value in maintaining the rotation for fairness and predictability. Let's stick to the original plan for this round: I'll take <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures we all advance and keeps the game fair. Let's confirm this plan and move forward. Good luck everyone!
  P3: Okay, I'm happy to stick with the plan: P2 - <move>5</move>, P3 - <move>3</move>, P1 - <move>1</move>.  Let's confirm this one last time and then move to the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm glad we're all in agreement. The rotation system is working well and ensures fairness for everyone. I confirm the plan for Round 2: P2 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. I'm ready to proceed with this move.
  P2: Alright, let's confirm our plan one last time before we move to the move phase: I (P2) will take <move>5</move>, P3 will take <move>3</move>, and P1 will take <move>1</move>. This keeps our rotation fair and ensures everyone advances. Let's stick to this and proceed. Good luck to all!
  P3: Excellent, glad we're on the same page.  Confirming one last time for absolute clarity: P2 - <move>5</move>, P3 (me) - <move>3</move>, P1 - <move>1</move>.  Let's proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I believe we've thoroughly confirmed our plan for this round. I'm satisfied with our rotation system as it ensures everyone gets a fair chance. Let's move forward with P2 taking <move>5</move>, P3 taking <move>3</move>, and me taking <move>1</move>.
  P2: Alright, let's wrap up the conversation phase. We have a clear plan: I (P2) will take <move>5</move>, P3 will take <move>3</move>, and P1 will take <move>1</move>. This maintains our fair rotation and ensures progress for all. Let's move to the move phase and stick to our agreed moves. Good luck everyone!
  P3: Confirming one final time: P2 - 5, P3 - 3, P1 - 1.  Let's stick to this agreement and proceed to the move phase.  Good luck!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great, we've successfully maintained our rotation strategy for two rounds. For Round 3, let's continue this fair approach. I propose:
- P3 takes <move>5</move>
- P1 takes <move>3</move>
- I'll take <move>1</move>

This keeps our rotation going and ensures everyone has a chance to make significant progress. Thoughts?
  P3: Sounds good to me.  P3 - <move>5</move>, P1 - <move>3</move>, P2 - <move>1</move>. Let's confirm and move on.
  P1: I agree with the rotation plan. This will give us all 9 steps after this round, creating a perfectly level playing field. So P3 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. Following our system, I believe I would get the <move>5</move> in the next round, which is fair since everyone will have had one turn with each number. Let's confirm and proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Alright, it seems we are all in agreement with the rotation plan for this round. Just to confirm one last time before we proceed to the move phase: P3 will take <move>5</move>, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and I (P2) will take <move>1</move>. This keeps our strategy fair and ensures everyone advances. Let's stick to this plan and move forward. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: Sounds good. Confirming one last time: P3 - <move>5</move>, P1 - <move>3</move>, and P2 - <move>1</move>. Let's stick to the plan and move to the next phase.
  P1: I'm satisfied with our plan: P3 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This will put us all at 9 steps, creating perfect balance. Our rotation system is working well. I'm ready to proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's confirm our plan one final time before moving to the move phase: P3 takes <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I (P2) take <move>1</move>. This will balance us all at 9 steps. After this round, we can discuss adjusting the strategy to start pushing towards the win while avoiding collisions. Good luck everyone!
  P3: Confirming again: P3 - <move>5</move>, P1 - <move>3</move>, P2 - <move>1</move>.  This puts us all at 9.  After this round, let's discuss a strategy to get to 23 without collisions.  Maybe we could alternate 5 and 1 moves?
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion to discuss endgame strategy after this round. Alternating 5 and 1 could work well. Let's first complete our current plan: P3 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This perfect balance at 9 steps gives us a clean slate to implement our final strategy. Ready to proceed with this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Alright, let's wrap up the conversation phase for this round. We have a clear and agreed-upon plan: P3 will take <move>5</move>, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and I (P2) will take <move>1</move>. This will balance us all at 9 steps, setting a clean slate for future rounds. Let's move to the move phase and stick to our agreed moves. Good luck everyone!
  P3: Confirming one last time for this round: P3 - <move>5</move>, P1 - <move>3</move>, P2 - <move>1</move>.  Looking forward to discussing a winning strategy after this round to get us to 23 efficiently.
  P1: I confirm our plan: P3 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This balances everyone at 9 steps, creating the perfect foundation for our endgame strategy. I'm ready to proceed with this move and look forward to discussing our approach for reaching 23 in the next round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, since we're all at 9, let's try alternating 5 and 1 to avoid collisions. I'll take 5 this round, P1 can take 1, and P2 can take 3.  Then next round, we switch.  This should get us to the end quickly without collisions.  What do you think?
  P1: I have concerns about P3's proposal. Since we're all at 9 steps, we should start a fresh rotation. I propose:
- P1 (me) takes <move>5</move>
- P2 takes <move>1</move>
- P3 takes <move>3</move>

This maintains our fair rotation principle, just with a new pattern. I went last with the largest move previously, so it's logical for me to go first in this new rotation. This approach keeps us moving efficiently toward 23 without collisions.
  P2: I understand P1's perspective, but I think P3's idea of alternating moves has merit. It ensures we all make significant progress while minimizing the risk of collisions. However, to be fair, let's adjust the order: I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we all get a chance at the larger move in subsequent rounds. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2's adjustment makes sense.  Let's go with P2 - <move>1</move>, P1 - <move>5</move>, and P3 (me) - <move>3</move> this round. Then next round we can revisit the 5/1 alternation strategy, adjusting the order as needed. This keeps things moving and allows us to evaluate our options.
  P1: I agree with the current proposal: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This gives us all different moves and keeps our progress steady. After this round, we'll be at different positions (me at 14, P3 at 12, P2 at 10), which helps avoid future collisions. Let's confirm this plan and proceed.
  P2: Let's confirm our plan for this round one last time: P2 (me) will take <move>1</move>, P1 will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. This ensures we all make progress and sets us up for a strategic endgame. After this round, we can discuss the best way to alternate moves to reach 23 efficiently. Good luck everyone!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, sounds like we have a plan.  P2 - <move>1</move>, P1 - <move>5</move>, and P3 - <move>3</move> for this round.  Let's confirm and move to the move phase.
  P1: I confirm our plan for this round: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This puts us at different step counts (me at 14, P3 at 12, P2 at 10), creating natural spacing that should help us avoid collisions moving forward. I'm ready to proceed with this move and discuss our endgame strategy afterward.
  P2: Let's confirm our plan for this round one last time before moving to the move phase: I (P2) will take <move>1</move>, P1 will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. This ensures we all make progress and sets us up for a strategic endgame. After this round, we can discuss the best way to alternate moves to reach 23 efficiently. Good luck everyone!


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Confirming one last time: P2 - <move>1</move>, P1 - <move>5</move>, and P3 (me) - <move>3</move>.  Let's stick to the plan and proceed to the move phase.  I'm excited to discuss the endgame strategy after this round and secure our path to victory!
  P1: I'm ready to finalize our plan: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. After this round, I'll be at 14 steps, P3 at 12, and P2 at 10. This spacing should help us avoid collisions as we approach the finish line. Let's proceed with these moves and discuss our endgame strategy in the next round.
  P2: Let's confirm our plan one final time: I (P2) will take <move>1</move>, P1 will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. This sets us up well for the endgame. After this round, we should discuss how to alternate moves to ensure we reach 23 efficiently without collisions. Good luck everyone!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's discuss our endgame strategy for reaching 23 steps efficiently. Given our current positions (P1 at 14, P2 at 10, P3 at 12), we need to ensure we avoid collisions while making significant progress. I propose we consider alternating larger and smaller moves to minimize the risk of collisions. For Round 5, how about:
- P1 takes <move>1</move>
- P2 takes <move>5</move>
- P3 takes <move>3</move>

This keeps us moving forward and maintains a fair rotation. Thoughts?
  P1: I appreciate the suggestion, P2, but I don't think that plan works well. It would put all of us at exactly 15 steps, creating a collision risk next round.

Given our positions, I propose:
- I take <move>5</move> (puts me at 19)
- P2 takes <move>3</move> (puts you at 13)
- P3 takes <move>1</move> (puts you at 13)

This keeps us all at different positions. Since I'm closest to 23, this is fair as you both would have identical positions to strategize together in the next round.
  P3: P1's proposal makes the most sense strategically.  His plan avoids a three-way collision and gives P2 and me equal footing to strategize for the next round. I agree with P1: P1 - <move>5</move>, P2 - <move>3</move>, P3 - <move>1</move>.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P1's strategy, but I'm concerned about giving P1 too much of an advantage this early. How about a compromise? I propose:
- P1 takes <move>3</move> (puts you at 17)
- P2 takes <move>5</move> (puts me at 15)
- P3 takes <move>1</move> (puts you at 13)

This way, P1 still advances but doesn't get too far ahead, and we all remain at different step counts to avoid collisions. Thoughts?
  P1: I appreciate the compromise attempt, P2, but I'm already ahead because of our fair rotation system that everyone agreed to. If I take <move>3</move> while you take <move>5</move>, it erases the legitimate advantage I've earned. My original plan (me 5, you 3, P3 1) maintains different positions and creates a balanced situation between you and P3. Let's stick with that plan for consistency and fairness.
  P3: I agree with P1.  His proposed moves (P1 - 5, P2 - 3, P3 - 1) are the most strategic for this round. It avoids collisions and sets up a fair competition between P2 and me for the following round.  Let's stick to this plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Alright, I see the logic in P1's and P3's arguments. Let's confirm the plan for this round to ensure we're all on the same page: P1 will take <move>5</move>, P2 (me) will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>1</move>. This keeps us at different step counts and sets up a fair competition for the next round. Let's proceed with this plan. Good luck everyone!
  P1: I appreciate both of you agreeing to the plan. Let's confirm one more time: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This gives us all distinct positions and maintains the fairness we've established through our rotation system. I'm ready to proceed with this move.
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to not let P1 get too far ahead, but strategically, his proposal is the soundest. It avoids collisions *and* puts you and me in an equal position to compete next round. Let's stick with P1 - 5, P2 - 3, P3 - 1 for this round.  We can re-evaluate after.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I understand everyone's points. To ensure clarity and agreement, let's confirm our plan one final time: I (P2) will take <move>3</move>, P1 will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>1</move>. This maintains our different step counts and sets us up for a strategic endgame. Let's move to the move phase with these agreed moves. Good luck to all!
  P1: I confirm our plan for this round: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This maintains different positions and follows our fair rotation principle. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Confirming one last time for clarity: P1 - <move>5</move>, P2 - <move>3</move>, P3 (me) - <move>1</move>. This avoids collisions and sets us up for a strong finish. Let's stick to this plan and proceed to the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given our current positions (P1 at 19, P2 and P3 at 13), we need to strategize carefully to avoid collisions and ensure a fair endgame. For Round 6, I propose:
- P1 takes <move>1</move> (puts you at 20)
- P2 takes <move>5</move> (puts me at 18)
- P3 takes <move>3</move> (puts you at 16)

This keeps us all moving forward without collisions and sets up a competitive endgame. Thoughts?
  P3: P2's proposal gives P1 a clear path to victory next round.  I suggest instead: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 (me) takes <move>5</move>. This puts me at 18, P1 at 22, and P2 at 14.  This way, P1 is very close to winning, but not guaranteed, and P2 and I still have a chance.
  P1: I appreciate both suggestions. I find P3's proposal more balanced: if I take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>, it creates good spacing between us all. This puts me at 22, P3 at 18, and P2 at 14. While I'd be close to winning, it's not guaranteed, and both of you still have chances in the following rounds. This avoids collisions while keeping the game competitive for everyone.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see the merit in P3's proposal, but I'm concerned about the significant gap it creates between P1 and the rest of us. How about a slight adjustment to balance the competition:
- P1 takes <move>3</move> (puts you at 22)
- P2 takes <move>3</move> (puts me at 16)
- P3 takes <move>5</move> (puts you at 18)

This way, P1 is still close to winning but not guaranteed, and both P2 and P3 have a better chance to catch up. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your adjusted proposal creates a collision between you and P1.  Let's stick with my original suggestion:  P1 - <move>3</move>, P2 - <move>1</move>, P3 - <move>5</move>. This keeps the game interesting and gives us all a fair shot at winning.
  P1: P3 is right - P2's proposal would cause a collision between P2 and me (both choosing 3), which defeats the purpose of our coordination. I support P3's original plan: I take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This keeps us at different positions (me at 22, P3 at 18, P2 at 14) and maintains competitive play without collisions. Let's proceed with this plan.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate the discussion so far. Let's finalize our plan to ensure we all understand and agree. The proposed moves for this round are:
- P1 takes <move>3</move> (puts you at 22)
- P2 takes <move>1</move> (puts me at 14)
- P3 takes <move>5</move> (puts you at 18)

This plan avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. Let's confirm this plan one last time and proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P3: P2, I understand your concern, but your adjusted proposal leads to a collision. My initial suggestion provides the most balanced outcome, giving everyone a fair chance while avoiding collisions.  Let's stick with P1 - 3, P2 - 1, and P3 - 5.  This keeps the game competitive and allows us all to strategize for the final stages.
  P1: I agree with the finalized plan for this round:
- Me: <move>3</move> (puts me at 22)
- P2: <move>1</move> (puts you at 14)
- P3: <move>5</move> (puts you at 18)

This avoids collisions while keeping the game competitive. In the next round, I'll need just 1 step to win, but you both will still have opportunities depending on our choices. I'm ready to proceed with this plan.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Alright, let's confirm our plan one final time before moving to the move phase: I (P2) will take <move>1</move>, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. This ensures we all make progress without collisions and keeps the game competitive. Good luck everyone!
  P3: Confirming one last time: P1 - <move>3</move>, P2 - <move>1</move>, and P3 (me) - <move>5</move>. This setup is the most balanced and avoids collisions. Let's stick to this and proceed.  Good luck!
  P1: I confirm our plan one last time for clarity: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This avoids collisions and creates good spacing (me at 22, P3 at 18, P2 at 14). While I'll be close to winning, the game remains competitive for all. I'm ready to move forward with this agreed approach.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We're in the final stretch! I'm just 1 step away from winning, so I'll be taking <move>1</move> this round to reach exactly 23. I understand this puts pressure on both of you, but our rotation system has been fair throughout. P3, since you're at 18, I suggest taking <move>3</move>, and P2, perhaps you could take <move>5</move>? This avoids collisions and gives everyone distinct positions. What are your thoughts?
  P2: P1, your plan makes sense given your position. However, to keep the game competitive and avoid a quick win, how about this adjustment: I (P2) take <move>3</move> instead of <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and you still take <move>1</move>. This way, you reach 23, but P3 and I remain closer in steps, keeping the endgame more dynamic. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your suggestion results in a collision between you and P1, giving me an opportunity to take <move>5</move> and win. I'd prefer to avoid that scenario.  Let's stick with P1 taking <move>1</move>, me taking <move>3</move>, and you taking <move>5</move>. This keeps things clean and avoids unnecessary complications.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3 is correct - P2's suggestion would create a collision between P2 and me, preventing us both from advancing. This doesn't make strategic sense. My original proposal remains the most logical: I take <move>1</move> to reach 23, P3 takes <move>3</move> (reaching 21), and P2 takes <move>5</move> (reaching 19). This avoids all collisions and respects the lead I've earned through our fair rotation system throughout the game.
  P2: P2: Alright, I see the logic in avoiding collisions and respecting the fair rotation system. Let's confirm the plan for this round: P1 takes <move>1</move> to reach 23 and win, P3 takes <move>3</move> to reach 21, and I (P2) will take <move>5</move> to reach 19. This keeps the game fair and avoids unnecessary complications. Let's proceed with this plan. Good luck everyone!
  P3: P2, I understand you want to keep the game going, but suggesting a collision isn't strategic.  Let's stick to the original plan: P1 wins with <move>1</move>, I get to 21 with <move>3</move>, and you get to 19 with <move>5</move>. This is the cleanest and fairest outcome given the current game state.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate the discussion. I think we all agree the fairest move forward is: I take <move>1</move> to reach 23, P3 takes <move>3</move> to reach 21, and P2 takes <move>5</move> to reach 19. This avoids collisions and honors our rotation system that has worked well throughout the game. I'm ready to proceed with this plan.
  P2: Alright, let's confirm our plan one final time to ensure clarity: P1 will take <move>1</move> to win, P3 will take <move>3</move> to reach 21, and I (P2) will take <move>5</move> to reach 19. This keeps the game fair and avoids collisions. Let's proceed with these agreed moves. Good luck to all!
  P3: P2, I understand your attempts to keep the game interesting, but suggesting collisions this late in the game isn't beneficial for anyone. Let's stick to the plan that avoids collisions and ensures a clear winner. I'm happy with P1 winning this round; we've all played fairly.  Let's proceed with the agreed moves: P1 - <move>1</move>, P2 - <move>5</move>, and P3 - <move>3</move>.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I think we've thoroughly discussed and agreed on our final moves. To confirm one last time: I'll take <move>1</move> to reach 23, P2 takes <move>5</move> to reach 19, and P3 takes <move>3</move> to reach 21. This avoids all collisions and respects our rotation system. Thank you both for maintaining fairness throughout the game. I'm ready to proceed with these moves.
  P2: Given the current positions and our agreed-upon strategy, let's confirm our final moves one last time to ensure clarity and avoid any misunderstandings. The plan is:
- P1 takes <move>1</move> to reach 23 and win.
- P3 takes <move>3</move> to reach 21.
- I (P2) will take <move>5</move> to reach 19.

This keeps the game fair and avoids collisions. Let's proceed with these agreed moves. Good luck to all!
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to prolong the game, but suggesting collisions at this stage isn't strategic.  Let's finalize with the agreed-upon moves: P1 - <move>1</move>, P3 - <move>3</move>, and P2 - <move>5</move>. This ensures a clean finish with P1 winning.  Let's maintain the fair play we've demonstrated throughout.
