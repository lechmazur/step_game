Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hello, P1 and P2. Let's make a deal. I'll choose 1, you choose 3, and we both advance. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I'm not sure I trust you.
  P1: P3, I appreciate your proposal, but how can we ensure you'll stick to it? P2, maybe we should consider a three-way deal to avoid collisions? Let's discuss.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand your concerns, P1 and P2. To build trust, I'm willing to make a binding agreement. I'll choose 1 this round, and if I advance, I'll choose 3 next round, allowing one of you to take 1 and advance as well. This way, we can alternate and ensure progress for at least two of us. What do you think?
  P2: P3, your proposal is tempting, but I'm hesitant to rely on a promise. Perhaps we could all agree to choose different numbers this round to ensure everyone advances at least one step?
  P1: P2 and P3, let's consider a simple rotation strategy to avoid collisions. For this round, I propose P1 (me) takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance. We can rotate the choices in the next rounds to keep it fair. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your willingness to discuss a strategy. P1, your rotation proposal is a good idea, but I think we should consider the long-term implications. If we rotate choices, it's possible that one player might get ahead and block the others from advancing. Instead, I suggest we stick with my original proposal: I'll choose 1 this round, and if I advance, I'll choose 3 next round, allowing one of you to take 1 and advance as well. This way, we can ensure that at least two players make progress without risking a blockade. What are your thoughts?
  P2: P3, I'm still wary of putting all my trust in promises. P1's rotation idea seems more reliable for consistent progress. Let's give it a try this round and see how it goes.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand your concerns. Let's simplify and ensure progress for all this round. I propose we stick to the rotation strategy: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all move forward without collisions. Let's confirm this plan and move on. What do you say?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I agree with P1's rotation strategy for this round. Let's confirm: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This way, we all advance without collisions.
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree to the rotation strategy for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's move forward.
  P1: P2 and P3, we've agreed on the rotation strategy. Let's stick to it and confirm our choices one last time. I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's proceed to the move phase.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hello, P1 and P2. I'm glad we were able to advance without collisions in the first round. Let's continue with the rotation strategy to ensure progress for all. This round, I propose we rotate the choices: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. What are your thoughts?
  P2: P3, I agree with your proposal for this round. P1, are you okay with taking 3 this time?  Let's keep this rotation going.
  P1: P3 and P2, I'm fine with taking 3 this round as proposed by P3. Let's continue with the rotation strategy to avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress. P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. Let's confirm and move on.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we're on the same page with the rotation strategy. To confirm, I'll take 1, P1 will take 3, and P2 will take 5 this round. Let's make sure to stick to this plan to avoid any collisions. If everything goes smoothly, we'll all advance again.
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with the rotation. Let's stick to the plan.
  P1: P1: Let's confirm one last time before we move: P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. We all agree?

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think we should continue with the rotation strategy again this round. It's been working well for all of us, and we've avoided collisions so far. This round, I propose: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 5. What do you think?
  P1: P3, P2, I agree that the rotation strategy has been effective so far. However, I'm starting to fall behind. To catch up, I propose a slight adjustment: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5 this round. This way, I can close the gap a bit. What are your thoughts?
  P2: P3, I understand P1's concern about falling behind. Let's stick to the original rotation this round. We can revisit adjustments later if needed. P2, are you okay with P3's proposal?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about falling behind, but I think it's too early to make adjustments to the rotation strategy. Let's stick to the original plan for now. P2, are you okay with my proposal for this round: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 5?
  P1: P3 and P2, I understand the importance of sticking to the rotation strategy, but I'm significantly behind. To keep the game fair and competitive, I suggest we adjust the strategy slightly this round. How about P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5? This way, I can catch up a bit while still avoiding collisions. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I'm open to adjusting the strategy if it ensures we all progress fairly. P1, what if we do P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5 this round, and then we re-evaluate for the next round?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand P1's concern about falling behind, but I think it's too early to make adjustments to the rotation strategy. Let's stick to the original plan for now. P2, are you okay with my proposal for this round: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 5?
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand your reluctance to adjust the strategy, but I'm significantly behind and need to catch up to keep the game competitive. How about a compromise? Let's stick to the rotation this round, but next round, we can re-evaluate and possibly adjust to allow me to catch up. For now, P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's confirm and move on. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm still concerned about falling behind. Let's stick to the rotation this round as P1 proposed, but I'd like to revisit the strategy for the next round to ensure a fairer game.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I think we've discussed enough for this round. I agree to stick to the original rotation strategy for now: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 5. Let's confirm and move on.
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate your willingness to stick to the rotation strategy. Let's confirm one last time for this round: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. We'll re-evaluate the strategy next round to ensure fairness. Everyone good with this?
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree to stick with the rotation this round. Let's confirm: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's move on.

  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, it looks like our rotation strategy hit a snag last round with a collision. I propose we adjust the strategy to avoid further collisions and ensure fair progress. For this round, how about P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5? This way, we can all advance without issues. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with P1's suggestion. Let's stick to P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5 this round to avoid collisions.
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree that we need to adjust the strategy to avoid further collisions. However, I'm not comfortable with P1's proposal. Instead, I suggest we stick to the original rotation strategy: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we can ensure that everyone advances without giving an unfair advantage to anyone. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: P2 and P3, I understand your concerns, but we need to address the collision issue from the last round. How about a compromise? P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all move forward and avoid repeating the same choices. Let's confirm and proceed. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I'm open to your original rotation suggestion, but I think P1's proposal to switch things up this round might be the best way to avoid collisions.  What if we try P1's suggestion this round and then go back to the original rotation next round?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about collisions, but I think we should stick to the original rotation strategy to ensure fairness and consistency. However, considering P2's significant lead, I propose a slight adjustment to give P1 a chance to catch up: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3 this round. This way, we can still avoid collisions while allowing P1 to make some progress. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the strategy. P3's proposal to let me take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3 sounds fair and helps me catch up a bit. Let's confirm this plan for this round and move forward. Everyone good with this?
  P2: P3, I like your suggestion. Let's go with P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3 for this round.
  P3: P1 and P2, I think we've reached a good compromise with the adjusted strategy for this round. To confirm, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. Let's make sure to stick to this plan to avoid any collisions. If everything goes smoothly, we'll all advance without issues. What do you think? Should we proceed with this plan?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with P3's adjusted strategy for this round. Let's confirm one last time: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we avoid collisions and I can catch up a bit. Everyone on board? Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P2, I'm glad we found a compromise that works for everyone. Let's stick to the plan and see where we are after this round.
  P3: I think we've discussed enough for this round. Let's confirm the plan one last time: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This way, we avoid collisions and P1 can catch up a bit. Everyone good with this? Let's proceed to the move phase.
