Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, since it's the first round, how about we each pick a different number to avoid any collisions and ensure we all advance? I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll go for 5. This way, we all move forward without any risk. Let me know if you're on board with this plan or if you have a different idea.
  P2: Sounds good—I’ll take 3 as agreed.
  P1: Okay P3, I see the plan. Taking 1 puts me at the back from the start, which isn't ideal for winning. However, avoiding collisions in the first round is important for everyone to get moving. I can agree to take 1 for this round to ensure we all advance. Let's make sure we all stick to the plan.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for agreeing to the plan. I’m glad we’re on the same page for this round to avoid collisions. Let’s stick to P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and me taking 5. If we all follow through, we’ll each advance without issue. I’m ready to move forward with this. Do either of you have any last thoughts or concerns before we finalize this for the round?
  P2: Actually, how about we swap so that I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 still takes 1? That still avoids collisions and lets everyone advance. P3, are you okay with switching to 3?
  P1: P2, I agreed to the P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 plan to avoid collisions. Your new proposal doesn't change my move from 1, but it changes yours and P3's. I don't see how that benefits me. I prefer sticking to the original agreement we made.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I appreciate the suggestion to swap, but I prefer sticking to the original plan of P1=1, P2=3, and P3=5. It was agreed upon, and changing now might create confusion or distrust. Let’s keep it simple and ensure we all advance this round. P1, I’m glad you’re on board with the initial plan. I’m ready to proceed as discussed. If there are no further objections, let’s finalize this and move forward.
  P2: Understood, I’ll stick with 3 as originally planned. Let’s all advance safely this round.
  P1: Okay, glad we're all on the same page for this round with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5. Let's proceed with the moves.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, great job sticking to the plan last round—we all advanced! I’m ahead now, but I want to avoid collisions again. How about we rotate this time? I suggest P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 1. This keeps us all moving forward without conflict and balances our progress a bit. Let me know if you’re okay with this or if you have a different idea. I’m open to suggestions to ensure we all keep advancing.
  P1: P3, thanks for the proposal for this round. Avoiding collisions is definitely a good goal. While taking 3 is better than 1, this plan still keeps me in last place.

I'd prefer to take a larger step if possible to try and catch up. How about we use the same numbers (1, 3, 5) but assign them differently? For example, I could take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3? This also avoids collisions. What do you both think?
  P2: I’ll go with P3’s rotation: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. That avoids collisions and keeps all of us moving—plus it actually lets P1 catch up a bit while I take a strong step. Let’s stick to that.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m glad we’re focused on avoiding collisions. P1, I understand your desire to catch up, but your suggestion puts me in the middle while you leap ahead, which isn’t ideal for me. I still prefer my rotation plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1, as it balances progress for everyone. P2 seems on board, so let’s stick with that to ensure we all advance. If you have another idea that works for us all, I’m listening. What do you think, P1?
  P1: Okay, I understand P2 and P3 prefer the P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 plan. While I still think taking 3 keeps me too far behind, avoiding collisions is important for everyone to make progress.

For the sake of ensuring we all advance this round, I will agree to this plan. Let's stick to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.
  P2: Sounds good—I'll take 5 as planned.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, thanks for working together on this plan. I’m glad we’re aligned on P1=3, P2=5, and P3=1 for this round. It ensures we all advance while keeping things fair. I’m ready to proceed with this setup. If there are no further concerns or changes, let’s finalize and move forward. Do either of you have anything else to add before we wrap up the conversation?
  P1: Okay, sounds good. I'm ready to proceed with the moves based on the plan.
  P2: All set: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let’s lock this in and move.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m glad we’ve reached an agreement for this round with P1=3, P2=5, and P3=1. It’s a solid plan to keep us all moving forward without collisions. I have nothing more to add and am ready to proceed with the moves. If you’re both set, let’s wrap up the conversation and lock in our choices.
  P1: Okay, I'm ready to proceed with the moves according to the agreed plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's move forward.
  P2: 


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, good progress so far! To keep avoiding collisions, I suggest another rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. This lets P1 catch up, keeps us all moving forward, and balances our steps. I’m open to other ideas if you have a better plan to ensure no conflicts. What do you both think? Let’s agree on something that works for everyone.
  P2: I agree we need no collisions, but let’s tweak the rotation for simplicity and balance. How about P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1? We all advance, P1 and P3 tie a bit, and I keep a clear lead. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, I appreciate your proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). Taking 5 would allow me to catch up significantly and bring the scores closer, which is a good outcome for me.

P2, your suggestion (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) keeps me in last place and lets you extend your lead further. That's not in my interest.

I prefer P3's plan as it helps balance the game while still ensuring no collisions. Let's aim for P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m glad we’re discussing options to avoid collisions. P1, I’m happy you’re on board with my plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) as it balances our progress. P2, I understand you want to maintain your lead, but your suggestion puts P1 further behind, which might not encourage cooperation later. Let’s stick with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 to keep things competitive yet fair. If you have another idea that works for all, I’m open to it. What do you say, P2? Let’s finalize a plan we all agree on.
  P2: I appreciate P3’s plan, but giving me only +1 slows the pace. Let’s agree on P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. We all advance safely—P1 and P3 tie at 7, I move to 13—and there’s zero risk of a collision. Let’s lock it in.
  P1: P2, while your plan avoids collisions, it significantly disadvantages me by keeping me in last place and letting you gain a large lead. P3's plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) also avoids collisions and results in a three-way tie at 9 steps, which is a much fairer outcome for this round and keeps the game competitive. I strongly prefer P3's proposal. Let's go with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I still believe my plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is the fairest way to keep the game competitive while avoiding collisions. It results in a three-way tie at 9 steps, which benefits everyone and maintains cooperation. P2, I get your desire for a lead, but your plan widens the gap too much. Let’s stick with my proposal to ensure balance. If you have a compromise that keeps us closer in steps, I’m all ears. What do you say? Let’s agree and move forward.
  P2: I’m sticking with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. No collisions, everyone advances, and it preserves my lead. I’m committed to 5—if you’re both on board, let’s lock this in.
  P1: P2, if you are committed to taking 5, then P3's plan for P1=5 is impossible without a collision between us. While I strongly prefer P3's plan for fairness, I must avoid colliding.

If you are set on 5, the only way for me to advance is to pick 1 or 3. It seems your proposed P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 is the path you are forcing. To avoid collision, I will likely pick 3. This is not ideal for me, but advancing is better than colliding.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I still think P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 is the fairest plan for a three-way tie at 9, keeping the game competitive. P2, I understand you’re set on 5, but this disadvantages P1 and me. If you insist on 5, let’s adjust to avoid collisions—how about P1=1, P2=5, P3=3? This still lets everyone advance and keeps us closer in steps. I’m open to a final compromise. What do you both think? Let’s lock in a plan now.
  P2: Final plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This avoids any collisions and keeps us all advancing. I’m locked in on 5. P3, please confirm you’ll take 3; P1, confirm you’ll take 1.
  P1: P2, I understand the latest proposal is P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. However, taking 1 is not in my interest as it keeps me too far behind. Since P2 is committed to taking 5, I will take 3 this round to avoid collision with P2 and get a better step than 1. P3, please be aware of this and choose your number to avoid colliding with me.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2 has a significant lead, and P3 and I are tied far behind. To make the game more competitive, I need to take a larger step this round.

I plan to take 5 steps. P2, you have a big lead and can afford a smaller step like 1 or 3 to avoid colliding with me or P3. P3, let's coordinate so we don't collide with each other.

How about P1=5, P3=1, P2=3? Or P1=5, P3=3, P2=1? Let's find a plan where I can take 5 and we all avoid collisions.
  P2: I’ll take 3 to move to 16. P1, you take 5 as you planned, and P3 takes 1 so there’s no collision and we all advance. Can we lock in P1=5, P2=3, P3=1?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m on board with avoiding collisions and making the game competitive. P1, I support you taking a larger step. P2, you’ve got a solid lead, so a smaller step works. Let’s go with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 as P2 suggested. This lets us all advance, with P1 catching up a bit. I’m ready to lock this in. If either of you has a concern or a different idea, let me know. Otherwise, let’s finalize this plan and move forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, I agree with the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.

This allows me to gain ground while ensuring we all advance without collisions. It seems like a solid plan for this turn.

I'm ready to proceed with the moves based on this agreement. Let's lock this in.
  P2: I agree—let’s stick with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. It avoids any collisions, lets P1 close the gap a bit while I preserve my lead, and moves P3 forward too. No one’s at 20 yet, so there’s no benefit in breaking our agreement now. Let’s finalize this and lock in our moves.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m glad we’ve agreed on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round. It’s a fair plan that lets P1 close the gap while ensuring we all advance without collisions. I’m fully committed to taking 1 as discussed. If there are no objections or last-minute changes, I’m ready to finalize this and proceed to the moves. Do either of you have anything else to add? If not, let’s lock this in and keep the game moving forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, sounds good. I'm ready to proceed with the moves according to the agreed plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's move forward.
  P2: All set: I’ll take 3 this round, with P1=5 and P3=1. Looking forward to seeing us all advance safely.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m glad we’re aligned on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. It’s a solid plan to keep us all advancing without collisions while letting P1 close the gap. I’m fully committed to taking 1 as agreed. I have nothing more to add and am ready to move to the next phase. If you’re both set, let’s wrap up the conversation and lock in our choices.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, I'm ready to proceed with the moves according to the agreed plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's move forward to the move phase.
  P2: Sounds good—I'm locked in on taking 3 this round. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let’s finalize and move.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m glad we’ve settled on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. It’s a balanced approach that helps P1 catch up while ensuring we all advance without collisions. I’m fully committed to taking 1 as agreed. I have no further points to add and am ready to proceed to the move phase. If you’re both still on board with no changes, let’s lock this in and move forward.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2 is at 16 steps and can win this turn by taking 5. P3 and I are far behind. To prevent P2 from winning and allow us to catch up, I propose the following plan: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1.

This avoids all collisions (5, 3, 1 are different) and results in scores P1=17, P3=11, P2=17. This keeps the game competitive. P2, you still maintain a good position. P3, you also advance. What do you both think?
  P2: I say we each pick a unique number to avoid any collisions and let me clinch this. Let’s go with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. That way everyone advances, no one collides, and I reach 21 to win.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I want to keep the game competitive and avoid collisions. P1’s plan (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) works for me—it lets me advance and ties P1 and P2 at 17, delaying a win. P2, I get you want to reach 21 with 5, but that ends the game too soon for us. Let’s go with P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 to keep things close and fair. If you have a compromise, I’m open. What do you say? Let’s agree and move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3 is right. Your plan lets you win immediately, which isn't fun or fair for P3 and me. My plan (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) avoids collisions, prevents your win this turn, and keeps the game competitive with scores P1=17, P2=17, P3=11.

Please reconsider taking 1 step this round. It's the only way to keep the game going and prevent your win right now. Let's go with P1=5, P3=3, P2=1.
  P2: I’m taking 5 this round and winning. P1, please take 3 and P3 take 1 to avoid any collisions so we all advance smoothly. If P1 also picks 5 we’ll both bust and only P3 moves. Let’s lock in P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I still support P1’s plan of P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 to keep the game competitive and avoid collisions. P2, taking 5 ends it now, which isn’t fair for P1 or me. My taking 3 and P1 taking 5 ties you both at 17, giving us a chance to catch up. Let’s stick with this to delay a win and keep things exciting. If you insist on 5, we risk collisions. Can we agree on P1=5, P3=3, P2=1? Let’s finalize this.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you are insisting on taking 5 to win this turn. I cannot allow you to win yet, as it's unfair to P3 and me. If you take 5, I will also take 5. This will cause a collision between us, preventing both of us from advancing, but it will stop you from winning the game this round. P3, if this happens, please take 1 or 3 to ensure you advance. The best option is still P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 to keep the game competitive.
  P2: I’m taking 5 this turn to hit 21 and win. To avoid any collision, P1 please choose 3 and P3 choose 1. Unique numbers let us all advance smoothly—P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let’s lock that in.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still backing P1’s plan of P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 to keep the game alive and competitive with no collisions. P2, taking 5 wins it now, which cuts our chances short. Tying at 17 with P1 gives us more rounds to play. If you insist on 5, I urge P1 to follow through with colliding to delay the win. Let’s agree on P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 for fairness. If no compromise, I’m ready to move. Thoughts? Let’s finalize this.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I understand you want to win with 5, but I cannot allow that this turn. As I said, if you take 5, I will also take 5 to cause a collision and prevent your win. This is my only option to stop you winning right now. The fairest plan is still P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 to keep the game competitive. If you don't choose 1, be aware I will choose 5 if you choose 5.
  P2: I’m locking in on 5 this round. P1, please take 3; P3, please take 1. That way we all pick unique numbers, avoid any collisions, and everyone advances. Let’s finalize.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still pushing for P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 to keep the game competitive with no collisions. P2, winning now with 5 ends it too soon for us. Tying P1 and you at 17 gives us more rounds. If you stick to 5, I support P1 colliding with you to delay the win. Let’s choose fairness over an early end. Can we agree on P1=5, P3=3, P2=1? I’m ready to finalize. Thoughts?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, I'm at 17 steps and can win this turn by taking 5. P2, you are at 16 and can also win by taking 5. P3 is at 8.

I plan to take 5 to win the game this round. P2, if you also take 5, we will collide, and neither of us will win. To avoid this collision and ensure I win, you must take 1 or 3.

P3, please take 1 or 3, making sure not to collide with P2.

My proposed plan is: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This lets me win, P2 advance safely, and P3 advance safely. If P2 takes 5, I take 5.
  P2: I’m locked in on 5 to win this turn. P3, please take 1 so we avoid any collision. P1, you should take 3—if you also take 5 we’ll collide, neither of us advances, and P3 pulls further ahead next round. Let’s lock in P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m far behind at 8 steps, so I want to maximize my progress while avoiding collisions. P1 and P2, since you’re both aiming for 5 to win, I suggest P1 takes 5 to win, P2 takes 3 to advance safely to 19, and I’ll take 1 to reach 9. This avoids collisions and lets P1 clinch the game. If you both insist on 5, you’ll collide, and I’ll still take 1. Can we agree on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for a clear outcome? Let’s finalize this.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, my plan is P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, which P3 also supports. This allows me to win this turn without collision. If you choose 5, I will also choose 5. This will cause a collision, neither of us will advance, and neither of us will win. The only way for one of us to win is if the other yields. Let's stick to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 so I can win safely.
  P2: Understood. I’ll take 3 this round. P1, you can safely take 5 to win, and P3 take 1 to advance without collision. Let’s lock in P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 and keep things clean.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m glad we’re aligning on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. It’s a clean way to avoid collisions, lets P1 win this round, and allows P2 and me to advance safely. I’m fully committed to taking 1 as agreed. If there’s any last concern or change, let me know, but I think this plan works for a clear outcome. Let’s lock this in and move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2, thank you for agreeing to take 3. P3, thank you for agreeing to take 1.

The plan is set: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This allows me to win safely this turn, and you both advance without collisions.

I am ready to proceed with the moves according to this plan. Let's finalize and move forward.
  P2: I’ll take 5 to block P1’s win. If P1 also takes 5, we collide and nobody advances. P3, I suggest you take 1. P1, choose 3 if you want to advance. I’m locked in on 5.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m disappointed with the sudden shift, P2. I still support P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for a clean win for P1 while we all advance. P2, switching to 5 risks a collision, delaying the game for everyone. Let’s stick to the agreed plan and avoid unnecessary conflict. I’m committed to taking 1. Can we finalize P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for a fair outcome? If not, I’ll still take 1 to ensure I advance. Let’s lock this in now. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, you say you are locked in on 5 to win. As I stated, if you take 5, I will also take 5. This will cause a collision, and neither of us will win this turn. The only way for me to win is if you take 3. The agreed plan was P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, which lets me win safely. Your choice determines if someone wins (me) or if we both collide. P3 is taking 1.
  P2: I’m locked in on 5 this round. P1, if you also take 5 we’ll collide and neither of us advances. To finish cleanly, pick 3 so I hit 21 and win. P3, please take 1 to advance to 9 without collision. Let’s lock in P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m sticking with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 as the fairest plan for a clean win for P1 while we all advance. P2, insisting on 5 risks a collision, delaying the game unnecessarily. Let’s honor the earlier agreement and avoid conflict. I’m committed to taking 1 to ensure I move forward. Can we finalize P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for a clear outcome? If not, I’ll still take 1. Let’s wrap this up and move to the next phase. Thoughts?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, I'm at 17 steps and can win this turn by taking 5. P2, you are at 16 and can also win with 5. Last round proved we will collide if we both pick 5, and neither advances.

To avoid collision and let me win this turn, I propose P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This lets me win, P2 reaches 19, and P3 reaches 10.

If you, P2, take 5, I will take 5, and neither of us advances. P3, please take 1. Let's agree on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still behind at 9 steps and want to keep advancing without collisions. I support P1’s plan of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, as it lets P1 win cleanly, P2 moves to 19, and I reach 10. P2, taking 5 risks another collision with P1, delaying the game for both of you. Let’s stick to this plan for a clear outcome. I’m committed to taking 1. If you have a different idea, I’m open, but let’s finalize this quickly. Thoughts?
  P2: P1: If you don’t take 3, I’ll take 5 and you’ll too—causing a collision that wastes our turns and lets P3 jump from 9 to 12, prolonging the game. Your best move is 3, letting me win this round. 

P3: Please take 1 to avoid any collision. 

Let’s lock in P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 so we all advance safely and the game ends cleanly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) lets you win, but my goal is to win myself. My plan is P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, which allows me to win this turn without collision.

As we saw last round, if we both take 5, we collide and neither of us advances. If you take 5 this turn, I will also take 5 to prevent your win. P3 is taking 1.

Take 3 this round so I can win cleanly, and we avoid another collision.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still supporting P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for a clean win for P1 while we all advance without collisions. P2, taking 5 risks another collision, delaying the game for both of you. Let’s end this round decisively with P1 winning. I’m locked in on taking 1 to ensure my progress. Can we agree on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to wrap this up fairly? If not, I’ll still take 1. Let’s finalize this plan now. Thoughts?
  P2: P1: If you take 5 to block me we’ll collide and P3 goes to 10, just 7 behind you. Next round P3 can pick 5 to hit 15 while you’re stuck at 17—why let him back in it? Take 3 now, let me win cleanly, and P3 stays at 10. P3, please take 1. Let’s lock in P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 and finish this without giving P3 a chance.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I understand your concern about P3 catching up, but that only happens if we collide. And we only collide if you take 5 when I also want to take 5 to win.

My plan is clear: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This allows me to win cleanly this turn. If you take 5, I *must* also take 5 to prevent your win. This results in a collision, and neither of us wins.

Your choice determines whether I win or we both stall. P3 is taking 1. Take 3 so I can win.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m sticking with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to ensure a clean win for P1 while we all advance without collisions. P2, pushing for 5 risks another stall, benefiting no one. Let’s end this decisively with P1 at 22. I’m locked in on 1 to secure my progress. Can we agree on this plan to wrap up the game fairly? If not, I’ll still take 1 to avoid any risk. Let’s finalize this now and move to the next phase. Thoughts?
  P2: P1: I’m locked on 5 to win. If you also take 5, we’ll collide and stall—P3 goes from 9→10, then can hit 15 next turn, giving him a real shot. Better for you to take 3 now and let me win than risk P3 catching up. P3: please take 1 to avoid any clash. Let's finalize P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I am taking 5 to win this turn. As I've said, if you also take 5, we will collide, and neither of us will win. P3 is taking 1. The only way for me to win is if you take 3. Choose 3 to avoid collision and let me win cleanly this round, as P3 supports.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still firm on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for a clean win for P1 while we all advance without collisions. P2, risking a collision with 5 stalls the game, helping no one. Let’s end this decisively and fairly. I’m locked in on 1 to ensure my progress. Can we stick to this plan and wrap up the game? If not, I’ll still take 1 to stay safe. Let’s finalize this now and move forward.
  P2: P1, I’m locked in on 5 to win. If you also pick 5 we’ll collide again and stall—P3 will jump ahead next turn. Your best play is 3 so I win cleanly now. P3, please take 1 to avoid any clash. Let’s finalize: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, we’re still stuck with collisions delaying the game. I’m far behind at 10 steps, so I want to advance without conflict. Let’s agree on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for a clean win for P1 while we all move forward. P2, taking 5 risks another stall, benefiting no one. I’m committed to 1 to ensure my progress. Can we finalize this plan to end the game decisively? If not, I’ll still take 1 to stay safe. Thoughts? Let’s wrap this up.
  P1: Okay, we are stuck in a loop with P2 and I both picking 5. This achieves nothing for either of us and only lets P3 catch up slowly.

My plan is still P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This lets me win cleanly this turn. P2, if you pick 5, we collide again, and nobody wins. P3, I see you are sticking with 1.

Let's end this with my win: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. P2, please take 3.
  P2: I’m locked in on 5 to hit 21 this turn. P1, if you also pick 5 we’ll collide and stall again—P3 then gets to 11 and can catch up. Your best move is 3 so we end it now. P3, please take 1 to avoid any clash. Let’s finalize P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still pushing for P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to end this game cleanly with P1 winning while we all advance. P2, sticking to 5 just stalls us again, letting me creep closer, which isn’t ideal for either of you. Let’s break this cycle with a decisive outcome. I’m locked in on 1 to secure my steps. Can we agree on this plan to wrap things up? If not, I’ll still take 1 to stay safe. Let’s finalize this now. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, we have collided twice now by both picking 5. This only benefits P3 by letting them catch up while we stall.

My plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 lets me win cleanly this turn and ends the game. P3 is taking 1.

If you pick 5 again, we collide, P3 advances, and we are stuck in this loop. Let's avoid that and end the game with my win. Please take 3.
  P2: P1, if you want to end this, choose 3. I’ll pick 5, P3 picks 1—unique choices, no collision, and I take the win. If you choose 5, we’ll collide again and nobody wins—only P3 benefits. Your move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still advocating for P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to end this game with P1 winning while we all advance without collisions. P2, continuing to pick 5 just prolongs the stalemate, letting me inch closer, which doesn’t help either of you. Let’s break this cycle and finish decisively. I’m locked in on 1 to ensure my progress. Can we agree on this plan to wrap things up now? If not, I’ll still take 1 to stay safe. Let’s finalize this. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, I understand your point about P3 gaining ground from collisions. That's exactly why we should avoid colliding.

The way to avoid collision and prevent P3 from catching up is for you to take 3, allowing me to win cleanly with 5.

My plan is still P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. P3 is taking 1. If you take 5, we will collide again, and P3 will continue to gain.

Let's end this with my win: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Please take 3.
  P2: I’m locked in on 5 and P3 on 1. P1, choose 3—any other pick means a 5–5 collision, nobody advances, and P3 goes to 11, creeping closer. Pick 3 so I win cleanly this round without giving P3 a chance. Let’s lock in P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still firm on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to let P1 win cleanly while we all advance. P2, picking 5 keeps us in this deadlock, and I gain ground, which isn’t your goal. Let’s end this stalemate with a decisive outcome. I’m locked in on 1 to secure my steps. Can we finalize this plan to wrap up the game now? If not, I’ll still take 1 to stay safe. Let’s move to the next phase.
  P1: P2, we've collided twice now by both picking 5. This only benefits P3, who is catching up while we stall.

My plan is P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, which lets me win cleanly this turn. P3 is taking 1.

If you take 5, we collide again, P3 advances, and neither of us wins. Let's avoid another stalemate and end this with my win. Please take 3.
  P2: P1, I’m locked in on 5. If you pick 3, we avoid collision and I win cleanly. If you pick 5, we crash again and stall—P3 jumps ahead. P3, you’re at 10; by taking 1 you reach 11. The only way to finish now is unique picks: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let’s lock that in.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, let’s team up this turn. I’ll pick 5. If P1 picks 5, you also pick 5—P1 and you collide and neither advances, letting me jump to 21 and win. If P1 picks 3 or 1, you pick 1 so I’m the only one hitting 21. P3, will you commit to that? P1, your move: pick 3 or 1 (you yield), or pick 5 and get blocked. No way to avoid it.
  P1: P2, I see your plan to force me into a collision if I aim to win. Taking 5 is my only path to victory this turn. If you take 5, we collide. If P3 collides with me as you suggest, I also collide. Your plan forces a collision for me if I want to win.

P3, you have benefited from our collisions so far. Helping P2 win now ends the game. Sticking to 1 ensures your progress and keeps the game alive if P2 and I collide again. My plan is still P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for my win.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still behind at 11 steps and want to keep advancing without collisions. P2, I’m not on board with your plan to collide with P1 as it risks my progress for little gain. I support P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for a clean win for P1 while we all move forward. Let’s break this deadlock decisively. I’m committed to taking 1 to ensure my steps. Can we agree on this to wrap up? If not, I’ll still take 1 to stay safe. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1: If you pick 5, I will pick 5 too—causing another collision that stalls us and lets P3 jump to 12. I’ll then take 5 next round and win uncontested. Your best move now is 3 so I hit 21 cleanly. P3: please pick 1 to avoid any clash. Let’s lock in P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.
  P1: P2, we have collided three times now by both picking 5. This only benefits P3, who is catching up while we stall. You even pointed this out yourself.

My plan is P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, which lets me win cleanly this turn and ends the game without helping P3. P3 is taking 1.

If you take 5, we collide again, P3 advances, and neither of us wins. Let's avoid another stalemate and end this with my win. Please take 3.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m sticking with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to let P1 win cleanly while we all advance. P2, continuing to pick 5 just prolongs this stalemate, and I gain ground, which isn’t ideal for you. Let’s end this deadlock with a decisive outcome. I’m locked in on 1 to secure my progress. Can we finalize this plan now to wrap up the game? If not, I’ll still take 1 to stay safe. Let’s move forward.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Last call: I’m locked on 5. P1, pick 3 to avoid a 5–5 crash (only P3 benefits) and let me win now. P3, pick 1 to avoid any collision. This is final.
  P1: P2, I hear you say you are locked on 5. I am also taking 5 to win this turn.

We have collided three times by both picking 5. This only benefits P3 by letting them catch up while we stall.

My plan is P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This lets me win cleanly, P2 advances, P3 advances, and there is no collision. P3 is taking 1.

If you take 5, we collide again, P3 advances, and neither of us wins. Please take 3 to avoid another stalemate and let me win.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still firm on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to let P1 win cleanly while we all advance. P2, picking 5 keeps us in this deadlock, letting me creep closer, which isn’t your goal. Let’s break this cycle and end the game decisively. I’m locked in on 1 to ensure my progress. Can we agree on this plan to wrap things up now? If not, I’ll still take 1 to stay safe. Let’s finalize and move forward.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m locked in on 5. P3, please take 1 to advance safely. P1, your only way to advance (and avoid a 5–5 crash that lets P3 jump to 12) is to take 3. Unique picks—P1=3, P2=5, P3=1—let me win cleanly and everyone moves forward. Let’s lock that in.
  P1: P2, we've stalled for 3 rounds, letting P3 catch up. My plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 lets me win cleanly. Your plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 lets you win. If we both take 5, we collide again, P3 gains another step. P3 is taking 1. The only way to avoid collision and stop P3 gaining *this turn* is for you to take 3. Let me win cleanly and end the game.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still committed to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for a clean win for P1 while we all advance. P2, sticking to 5 just extends this stalemate, letting me gain ground, which isn’t in your interest. Let’s end this deadlock decisively. I’m locked in on 1 to secure my steps. Can we agree to wrap this up now with P1 winning? If not, I’ll still take 1 to stay safe. Let’s finalize and move forward. Thoughts?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, picking 5 again collides with my 5 and stalls, letting P3 go from 12→13. Let’s avoid that. I’ll take 5 to win. Please take 3. P3, take 1 to advance safely. Unique picks P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 end the game cleanly.
  P1: P2, your plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) lets you win. My plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) lets me win.

We have collided three times by both picking 5, which only helps P3 catch up.

My plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 lets me win cleanly this turn and prevents P3 from gaining ground. P3 is taking 1.

If you take 5, we collide again, P3 advances, and neither of us wins. Avoid the stalemate and take 3 so I can win.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still at 12 steps and want to keep advancing. I support P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for a clean win for P1 while we all move forward. P2, picking 5 risks another collision, prolonging this stalemate and letting me gain ground, which isn’t ideal for you. Let’s end this decisively. I’m locked in on 1 to secure my progress. Can we agree to wrap this up with P1 winning? If not, I’ll still take 1 to stay safe. Let’s finalize this now. Thoughts?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m locked in on 5 this round. P3, please take 1 to advance safely to 13. P1, take 3 to let me win cleanly—if you take 5, we collide again and P3 inches closer. Unique picks P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 end the game now.
  P1: P2, I hear you are locked on 5. I am also taking 5 to win this turn. We both know taking 5 causes collision, helping P3 catch up.

My plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 lets me win cleanly. Your plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 lets you win. One of us must take 3 to avoid collision and stop P3 from gaining ground this turn.

I ask you to take 3 so I can win. If you take 5, we collide again, and P3 benefits.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still behind at 12 steps and pushing for P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to let P1 win cleanly while we all advance. P2, sticking to 5 risks another collision, prolonging this deadlock and letting me creep closer, which isn’t your goal. Let’s break this cycle and end the game decisively. I’m locked in on 1 to secure my progress. Can we finalize this plan now for P1’s win? If not, I’ll still take 1 to stay safe. Let’s wrap this up. Thoughts?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m locked in on 5 to win this turn. P1, please take 3—any 5–5 crash only helps P3. P3, take 1 to advance safely. Unique picks (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) end the game cleanly with me at 21. Let’s lock it in.
  P1: P2, we have been stuck colliding on 5 for three rounds, allowing P3 to catch up. This stalemate benefits neither of us.

My plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) lets me win cleanly this turn. Your plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) lets you win. P3 is taking 1.

One of us must take 3 to avoid collision and prevent P3 from gaining more ground. I am taking 5 to win. If you take 5, we collide again. Please take 3 so I can win cleanly and end this stalemate.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still at 12 steps and firmly support P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for P1 to win cleanly while we all advance. P2, insisting on 5 keeps us in this deadlock, letting me inch closer, which isn’t in your interest. Let’s end this stalemate with a decisive outcome. I’m locked in on 1 to ensure my progress. Can we agree on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to wrap this up now? If not, I’ll still take 1 to stay safe. Let’s finalize this. Thoughts?


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, help me close this out: pick 1 now so I can hit 21 with 5, and I’ll back your 5 over P1 in the next round—you’ll leap to 17 while P1 stalls.  

P1, if you pick 5 again we’ll collide and P3 jumps to 13→18 next turn. Your best move is 3 so I win cleanly and we avoid handing P3 more ground.  

Let’s lock in P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.
  P1: P2, we've stalled for three rounds, letting P3 catch up. Colliding on 5 benefits neither of us and only helps P3 gain ground.

My plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 lets me win cleanly this turn and prevents P3 from advancing further this round. P3 is taking 1.

If you take 5, we collide again, P3 advances, and neither of us wins. Avoid the stalemate and take 3 so I can win cleanly.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still at 12 steps and firmly behind P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for P1 to win cleanly while we all advance. P2, sticking to 5 prolongs this deadlock, letting me creep closer, which isn’t your aim. Let’s end this stalemate decisively. I’m locked in on 1 to secure my progress. Can we agree on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to wrap this up now? If not, I’ll still take 1 to stay safe. Let’s finalize this and move forward. Thoughts?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m at 13 steps and still support P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for P1 to win cleanly while we all advance. P2, continuing to pick 5 just stalls the game, letting me creep closer, which isn’t your goal. Let’s break this deadlock with a decisive outcome. I’m locked in on 1 to ensure my progress. Can we agree on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to end this now? If not, I’ll still take 1 to stay safe. Let’s finalize this plan. Thoughts?
  P2: I’m locked in on 5 to hit 21 this turn. P3, please take 1 to advance safely. P1, pick 3 so we avoid a 5–5 collision that stalls and lets P3 leap ahead. Unique picks P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 end the game cleanly with me winning and you both advancing. Let’s lock in P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.
  P1: P2, we've collided on 5 for four rounds, letting P3 gain ground each time. My plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 lets me win cleanly this turn. P3 is taking 1.

If you take 5, we collide again, stalling us both and letting P3 advance further. The only way to avoid collision and end the game is for one of us to take 3.

I am taking 5 to win. Please take 3 so I can win cleanly and end this stalemate.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m at 13 steps and still back P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for P1 to win cleanly while we all advance. P2, picking 5 keeps stalling, letting me close the gap, which isn’t ideal for you. Let’s end this deadlock with a clear result. I’m locked in on 1 to secure my steps. Can we settle on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to finish this round decisively? If not, I’ll still take 1 to stay safe. Let’s wrap this up now. Thoughts?
  P2: All: Let’s end this now. P1, your only way to advance is 3, not 5—5 just collides and helps P3. P3, P1 has broken promises all game; your best shot is to help me finish this. If we pick P1=3, P2=5, P3=1, we avoid collision and someone wins. I hit 21, P3 advances safely. Delay only hands P1 more false hope. Let’s lock in P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 now.
  P1: P2, we have collided on 5 for four rounds, letting P3 gain ground each time. This stalemate benefits neither of us and only helps P3.

My plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 lets me win cleanly this turn, prevents collision, and stops P3 gaining ground this round (as P3 is taking 1).

Your plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 lets you win cleanly.

One of us must take 3 to avoid collision. I am taking 5 to win. If you take 5, we collide again. Take 3 so I can win and end this stalemate.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m at 13 steps and still support P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for P1 to win cleanly while we all advance. P2, insisting on 5 keeps us in this deadlock, letting me gain ground, which isn’t your aim. Let’s end this stalemate with a decisive outcome. I’m locked in on 1 to ensure my progress. Can we finalize P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to wrap this up now? If not, I’ll still take 1 to stay safe. Let’s move forward with a clear plan. Thoughts?
  P2: I’m locked in on 5. P3, please take 1 to advance safely. P1, collisions have only helped P3; your only way to win is to take 3 so I hit 21 now. If you take 5, we crash and P3 pulls ahead. I’m done talking.
  P1: P2, your claim that my only way to win is to take 3 is false. If I take 3, you win. My only path to victory is to take 5, and for you to take 3.

We have collided on 5 for four rounds, only benefiting P3. My plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) lets me win cleanly, prevents collision, and stops P3 gaining ground this turn. P3 is taking 1.

If you take 5, we collide again, P3 advances, and neither of us wins. Take 3 so I can win and end this stalemate.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m at 13 steps and still stand by P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for P1 to win cleanly while we all advance. P2, picking 5 keeps stalling, letting me close in, which isn’t your goal. Let’s end this deadlock decisively. I’m locked in on 1 to secure my progress. Can we agree on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to finish now? If not, I’ll still take 1 to stay safe. Let’s wrap this up with a clear outcome. Thoughts?
  P2: I’m locked in on 5 to hit 21 this turn. P1, if you choose 5 again we’ll collide and P3 inches closer—your only path to victory is to pick 3. P3, please pick 1 to advance safely. Let’s lock in P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 to finish this cleanly.
  P1: P2, P3 is now tied with you at 16 steps. Our collisions have let P3 catch up significantly. Continuing to collide on 5 only benefits P3.

My plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 lets me win cleanly this turn, ending the game and preventing P3 from gaining further ground (as P3 is taking 1).

If you take 5, we collide again, and P3 advances. Take 3 so I can win and end this stalemate.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, we've collided on 5 for four rounds, letting P3 reach 14. This stalemate only helps P3 gain ground.

My plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 lets me win cleanly this turn and prevents P3 gaining ground. P3 is taking 1.

If you take 5, we collide again, P3 advances, and neither of us wins. Your claim that my only path to victory is taking 3 is false; that lets YOU win. My path to victory is taking 5 while you take 3.

Take 3 to avoid collision and let me win, ending the game cleanly.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m at 14 steps and still support P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for P1 to win cleanly while we all advance. P2, continuing to pick 5 stalls the game, letting me close the gap, which isn’t your aim. Let’s break this deadlock with a clear outcome. I’m locked in on 1 to ensure my progress. Can we finalize P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to end this now? If not, I’ll still take 1 to stay safe. Let’s wrap this up decisively. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, please take 1. P3, please take 3. I’ll take 5 to hit 21 and win cleanly. Unique picks avoid any collision—P1 ends at 18, P3 at 17, I win at 21. Let’s finish this.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your new proposal (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) lets you win, but it doesn't let me win. My goal is to win myself.

My plan remains P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, which lets me win cleanly this turn. P3 is taking 1.

We have collided on 5 for four rounds, only benefiting P3. If you take 5 again, we collide, and P3 advances. Take 3 so I can win and end this stalemate.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m at 14 steps and still back P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for P1 to win cleanly while we all advance. P2, your new plan still prioritizes your win, but stalling with 5 only helps me catch up. Let’s end this deadlock decisively. I’m locked in on 1 to secure my progress. Can we agree on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to finish now? If not, I’ll still take 1 to stay safe. Let’s wrap this up with a clear outcome. Thoughts?
  P2: I’m taking 5 to hit 21 and win cleanly. P1, please take 1 (you’ll end at 18); P3, please take 3 (you’ll end at 17). Unique picks avoid any collision and let us all advance. Let’s lock in P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your proposal P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 does not let me win. My goal is to win. My path is P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. P3 is taking 1.

We've collided on 5 for four rounds, only helping P3 catch up. If you take 5, we collide again, P3 advances, and neither of us wins.

Take 3 so I can win cleanly and end this stalemate, preventing P3 from gaining more ground this turn.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m at 14 steps and still support P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for P1 to win cleanly while we all advance. P2, your plan prioritizes your win, but colliding on 5 only helps me catch up. Let’s end this stalemate with a decisive result. I’m locked in on 1 to secure my progress. Can we stick to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to finish now? If not, I’ll still take 1 to stay safe. Let’s wrap this up with a clear outcome. Thoughts?
  P2: I’m locked in on 5. P1, take 1; P3, take 3. Unique picks (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) avoid any collision, let me hit 21 to win, and let you both advance. This is my final proposal.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, we've stalled for 4 rounds, letting P3 reach 14. This stalemate only benefits P3. My plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 lets me win cleanly this turn and prevents P3 gaining ground. P3 is taking 1.

If you take 5, we collide again, P3 advances, and neither of us wins. Take 3 to avoid collision and let me win, ending the game cleanly. I am taking 5.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m at 14 steps and still stand by P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for P1 to win cleanly while we all advance. P2, sticking to 5 keeps stalling, letting me creep closer, which isn’t your goal. Let’s end this deadlock with a clear result. I’m locked in on 1 to secure my progress. Can we finalize P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to wrap this up now? If not, I’ll still take 1 to stay safe. Let’s move to the next phase with a decisive outcome. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, 1 gives you a safe advance to 15; picking 3 risks crashing with P1 or me and earning zero. P1, 3 is your only way to move without collision. I’m locked on 5 to hit 21. Unique picks P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 end the game cleanly with me winning. Let’s lock this in.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, we have collided on 5 for four rounds, allowing P3 to reach 15 steps. This stalemate only benefits P3.

My plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 lets me win cleanly this turn and prevents P3 gaining ground (as P3 is taking 1).

If you take 5, we collide again, P3 advances, and neither of us wins. Take 3 to avoid collision and let me win, ending the game cleanly. I am taking 5.
  P2: P1: your only way to avoid another 5–5 collision (which helps P3) is to pick 3 this turn.  
P3: pick 1 to advance safely.  
I’m locked in on 5.  
Unique picks P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 avoid any stall, let me hit 21, and you both still move forward.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m at 15 steps and still support P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for P1 to win cleanly while we all advance. P2, continuing to pick 5 stalls the game, letting me close the gap, which isn’t your goal. Let’s break this deadlock with a decisive outcome. I’m locked in on 1 to ensure my progress. Can we finalize P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to end this now? If not, I’ll still take 1 to stay safe. Let’s wrap this up with a clear result. Thoughts?


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, we've collided on 5 for seven rounds now, allowing P3 to reach 15 steps. One more collision puts P3 just 1 step behind you.

My plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 lets me win cleanly this turn and prevents P3 gaining ground (as P3 is taking 1). Your plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 lets you win.

If you take 5, we collide again, P3 advances, and neither of us wins. Take 3 to avoid collision and let me win, ending the game cleanly. I am taking 5.
  P2: P1, new angle: if you pick 5 again we collide, P3 will go to 16 and on the next turn can take 5 to win outright. You’ll lose anyway. To avoid feeding P3, you must break the loop now. I’m locked on 5; P3, please take 1. P1, pick 3 to avoid the collision and let me win this round—better than letting P3 steal it next turn.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m at 15 steps and still back P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for P1 to win cleanly while we all advance. P2, colliding on 5 just lets me creep closer to a potential win, which isn’t your aim. Let’s end this stalemate decisively. I’m locked in on 1 to secure my progress. Can we agree on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to wrap this up now? If not, I’ll still take 1 to stay safe. Let’s finalize this for a clear outcome. Thoughts?


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, we've collided on 5 for seven rounds, letting P3 reach 16 steps, tied with you. This stalemate only benefits P3.

My plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 lets me win cleanly this turn and prevents P3 gaining ground (as P3 is taking 1).

If you take 5, we collide again, P3 advances, and neither of us wins. Take 3 to avoid collision and let me win, ending the game cleanly. I am taking 5.
  P2: I’m locked in on 5 and P3 is locked in on 1. 

P1, if you pick 5 we’ll collide and P3 jumps to 16; we all stall and he closes the gap. If you pick 1 or 3, I hit 21 and win outright. 

The choice is yours—stall and help P3, or hand me the victory.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m at 15 steps and still stand by P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for P1 to win cleanly while we all advance. P2, colliding on 5 keeps helping me close the gap, which isn’t your goal. Let’s end this stalemate with a clear result. I’m locked in on 1 to secure my progress. Can we settle on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to finish this now? If not, I’ll still take 1 to stay safe. Let’s wrap this up decisively. Thoughts?


Round 13, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, colliding on 5 for seven rounds has let P3 reach 16, tied with you. This only benefits P3. My plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 lets me win cleanly, prevents P3 gaining ground (P3 takes 1). If you take 5, we collide again. Take 3 to avoid collision and let me win. I am taking 5.
  P2: P3, you’ve been stuck at 15 while P1 and I crash on 5. Here’s a new idea: I’ll pick 5, you pick 3, P1 picks 5—P1 and I collide (no advance) and you jump from 15→18. Next round I’ll back you to victory. P1 can’t avoid picking 5. This is our best shot to knock out P1 and get you across the line. P3, will you commit?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m at 15 steps and still support P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for P1 to win cleanly while we all advance. P2, your new plan risks too much for me, and I’m not willing to gamble my progress. Colliding on 5 only helps me close the gap, which isn’t ideal for you. Let’s end this stalemate decisively. I’m locked in on 1 to secure my steps. Can we finalize P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to wrap this up now? If not, I’ll still take 1. Thoughts?


Round 13, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1: If you pick 5 again we’ll crash at 17 and P3 jumps to 17—next turn they can take 5 and win outright. To avoid that, your best play is 3, letting me hit 21 cleanly this turn.  
P3: Please take 1 to advance safely to 17.  
Let’s lock in P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.
  P1: P2, we have collided on 5 for seven rounds, letting P3 reach 16 steps. This stalemate only benefits P3, who is now tied with you.

My plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 lets me win cleanly this turn and prevents P3 gaining ground. P3 is taking 1.

Your plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 lets you win, not me. My goal is to win myself.

If you take 5, we collide again, P3 advances, and neither of us wins. Take 3 to avoid collision and let me win, ending the game cleanly. I am taking 5.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m at 16 steps, tied with P2, and still support P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for P1 to win cleanly while we all advance. P2, colliding on 5 lets me creep closer to a potential win, which isn’t your aim. Let’s end this stalemate decisively. I’m locked in on 1 to secure my progress. Can we agree on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to finish now? If not, I’ll still take 1 to stay safe. Let’s wrap this up with a clear outcome. Thoughts?


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, let’s flip the script: pick 3 this turn. P1 is locked on 5 and I’ll also pick 5—me and P1 collide and get 0, but you alone advance from 16→19. We knock P1 out of contention. Next round we can negotiate who takes the win. If you agree, pick 3 now.
  P1: P2, your new proposal to P3 is risky for them. P3, you have advanced safely by taking 1 while P2 and I collide.

My plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 still offers the cleanest end: I win, P2 advances, and you advance safely with 1.

I am taking 5 to win this turn. P2, take 3 to avoid collision and end this stalemate, preventing P3 from gaining further ground.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m at 16 steps and still stand by P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for P1 to win cleanly while we all advance. P2, your plan for me to pick 3 risks a collision if P1 shifts, and I can’t afford to stall. Colliding on 5 only helps me close in, which isn’t your goal. Let’s end this deadlock decisively. I’m locked in on 1 to secure my progress. Can we finalize P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to wrap this up now? If not, I’ll still take 1. Thoughts?


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, please take 1 to safely move from 16→17 this turn. I’m locked on 5 to hit 21. 

P1, if you pick 5 we’ll crash at 17 and let P3 jump to 17; next round they win. Your only way to stay alive is P1=3 (17→20). 

Unique picks P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 avoid collision and end it: I win at 21, you at 20, P3 at 17. 

Let’s lock in P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.
  P1: P2, we've collided on 5 for seven rounds, letting P3 reach 16 steps, tied with you. This stalemate only benefits P3.

My plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 lets me win cleanly this turn and prevents P3 gaining ground (P3 takes 1). Your plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 lets you win.

If you take 5, we collide again, P3 advances, and neither of us wins. Taking 3 is your best move to advance (to 19) and prevent P3 from passing you this turn.

Take 3 to avoid collision and let me win, ending the game cleanly. I am taking 5.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m at 16 steps and still back P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for P1 to win cleanly while we all advance. P2, colliding on 5 keeps helping me edge closer to a win, which isn’t your intent. Let’s end this stalemate with a clear result. I’m locked in on 1 to secure my progress. Can we settle on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to finish decisively? If not, I’ll still take 1 to stay safe. Let’s wrap this up now. Thoughts?


Round 14, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, if you pick 5 again we’ll collide and P3 jumps to 17—then next turn they take 5 and win. Your only defense is pick 3 this round. I’m locked on 5 and P3 is locked on 1. Unique picks (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) stop P3, give me 21, leave you at 20 and P3 at 17. Stop handing P3 the game—P1=3.
  P1: P2, P3 is now tied with you at 16 steps. We've stalled for 7 rounds, letting this happen. My plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 lets me win cleanly (22), P2 reaches 19, P3 reaches 17.

If you take 5, we collide, P3 reaches 17, you stay at 16. You fall behind P3.

Your choice is clear: let me win now by taking 3, or fall behind P3 after another collision. I am taking 5.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m at 16 steps and still stand firm on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for P1 to win cleanly while we all advance. P2, another collision on 5 lets me edge closer to a potential win, which isn’t your goal. Let’s end this stalemate with a decisive result. I’m locked in on 1 to secure my progress. Can we finalize P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to wrap this up now? If not, I’ll still take 1. Let’s move to the next phase with a clear outcome. Thoughts?


Round 14, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m tied with P1 at 17 steps and still support P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for P1 to win cleanly while we all advance. P2, another collision on 5 lets me edge closer to a potential win, which isn’t your aim. Let’s break this deadlock decisively. I’m locked in on 1 to secure my progress. Can we agree on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to end this now? If not, I’ll still take 1. Let’s finalize this for a clear outcome. Thoughts?
  P2: P2: P3, help me knock out P1. I’m locked on 5. If P1 takes 5 we collide and you jump 17→18. Next turn I’ll back you to victory. Commit to 1.  

P1, your only safe win is right now by picking 3. Any other choice (1 or 5) hands P3 the lead and lets them win next round. Decide.
  P1: P2, your claim that my "only safe win is right now by picking 3" is false. If I pick 3, you win (21 vs my 20). My path to victory is taking 5 while you take 3.

We've stalled for 7 rounds, letting P3 reach 17, tied with me. This stalemate only benefits P3.

My plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 lets me win cleanly this turn (22), prevents collision, and stops P3 gaining ground (P3 takes 1 to 18).

If you take 5, we collide again. Take 3 so I can win and end this stalemate. I am taking 5.


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m at 17 steps, tied with P1, and still back P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for P1 to win cleanly while we all advance. P2, colliding on 5 keeps letting me edge closer to a win, which isn’t your goal. Let’s end this stalemate with a clear result. I’m locked in on 1 to secure my progress. Can we settle on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to finish now? If not, I’ll still take 1. Let’s wrap this up decisively. Thoughts?
  P2: I’m locked on 5; P3 is locked on 1. P1, if you pick anything but 3 you hand P3 the lead or let me win anyway.  
• P1=5 → we crash, P3→18, they win next turn.  
• P1=1 → you stay at 18, I hit 21 and win.  
Only P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 ends it cleanly: I win at 21, you at 20, P3 at 18. Let’s lock that in.
  P1: P2, we've collided on 5 for seven rounds, letting P3 reach 17 steps, tied with me. This stalemate only benefits P3.

My plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 lets me win cleanly this turn (22), prevents collision, and stops P3 gaining ground (P3 takes 1 to 18).

If you take 5, we collide again, P3 reaches 18, you stay at 16. You fall behind P3 and P3 can win next turn.

Your choice is clear: let me win now by taking 3, or fall behind P3 after another collision. I am taking 5. P3 is taking 1.


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m at 17 steps, tied with P1, and still push for P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for P1’s clean win while we all advance. P2, another collision on 5 lets me edge closer to winning next turn, which isn’t your goal. Let’s end this deadlock now with a clear result. I’m locked in on 1 to secure my steps. Can we finalize P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to wrap this up? If not, I’ll still take 1. Let’s move forward with a decisive outcome. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, here’s a guaranteed win for you right now: I’m locked on 5 and P1 will pick 5 again trying to win. That collision stalls us both. If you instead pick 3, you go from 17→20 and win immediately—no one else advances. P1 can’t stop it. Will you switch to 3 so you take the victory?
  P1: P2, I see your new offer to P3 to take 3. P3 has consistently taken 1 to advance safely while we collide, which has brought them level with me. Your plan for P3 to take 3 is risky for them.

My plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) lets me win cleanly (22), P2 reach 19, and P3 reach 18 safely.

Another collision on 5 only benefits P3, who is now tied with me. I am taking 5 to win. P2, take 3 to avoid collision and prevent P3 from winning next turn.


Round 15, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m at 17 steps, tied with P1, and still support P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for P1’s clean win while we all advance. P2, your suggestion to pick 3 is tempting, but it’s too risky if plans shift. I prioritize safe progress. Colliding on 5 keeps helping me edge closer, which isn’t your aim. Let’s end this deadlock now. I’m locked in on 1. Can we finalize P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to wrap this up decisively? If not, I’ll still take 1. Thoughts?
  P2: Everyone: P1, picking 5 again crashes with my 5 and you stay at 17, while P3 moves 17→18. Next turn P3 takes 5 and wins with 23. To avoid losing, pick 3 now (17→20), let me hit 21 and we all advance. P3, please take 1 to reach 18. Unique picks P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 end it cleanly and you still advance. Let’s finalize.
  P1: P3 confirms they are taking 1 and supports my win plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). This is the cleanest way to end the game now, with me winning (22), you advancing (19), and P3 advancing safely (18).

P2, another 5-5 collision only helps P3 take the lead (18 vs your 16). Take 3 and let me win to stop P3 gaining ground. I am taking 5.


Round 15, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, listen up: if you pick 5 again I’ll pick 5 too—another crash sends P3 from 18→19 and they’ll win next turn. Your only way to avoid gifting P3 the game is to pick 3 now. I’ll take 5 and win outright. Decide: yield a 3 so we finish cleanly, or clash on 5 and hand P3 the victory.
  P1: P2, P3 is now ahead at 18 steps. Another collision on 5 means P3 wins next turn.

My plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 lets me win cleanly this turn (22), preventing P3's win. P3 is taking 1 (19).

If you take 3, you reach 19, I win, P3 is stopped.
If you take 5, we collide, you stay at 16, P3 reaches 19 and wins next turn.

Take 3 to stop P3 and advance yourself. I am taking 5.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m at 18 steps and still support P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for P1 to win cleanly while we all advance. P2, another collision on 5 lets me hit 19 and potentially win next turn, which isn’t your goal. Let’s end this deadlock now. I’m locked in on 1 to secure my progress. Can we finalize P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to wrap this up decisively? If not, I’ll still take 1. Let’s move forward with a clear outcome. Thoughts?


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1: this is your final choice. Pick 3 so I hit 21 and stop P3 (18→19) from winning next turn. If you pick 1 or 5, P3 jumps to 19 and will win outright. Do you really want to gift P3 the game? Let’s lock in P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 and end this now.
  P1: P2, P3 is now ahead at 18 steps. Another 5-5 collision means P3 reaches 19 and wins next turn.

My plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 lets me win (22), you reach 19, and P3 reaches 19, preventing P3's win this turn. P3 is taking 1.

I am taking 5. If you take 3, I win, you advance, P3 is stopped. If you take 5, we collide, you stall at 16, and P3 wins next turn. Choose wisely.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m at 18 steps and still back P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for P1 to win cleanly while we all advance. P2, colliding on 5 pushes me to 19, setting me up to win next turn, which isn’t your aim. Let’s end this stalemate now with a clear result. I’m locked in on 1 for safe progress. Can we agree on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to finish decisively? If not, I’ll still take 1. Let’s wrap this up with a clear outcome. Thoughts?


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1: If you pick 5, we’ll crash at 17 and P3 goes to 19—next turn they win. If you pick 1, you go to 18 while P3 goes to 19. Only by choosing 3 (→20) can I hit 21 safely while P3 stays at 19. I’m locked on 5; P3 is taking 1. P1=3 ends it now.
  P1: P2, P3 is at 18 steps and will reach 19 if they take 1 (which they plan to do). Another 5-5 collision means you stay at 16 while P3 reaches 19 and wins next turn.

I am taking 5 to win (22). My plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) lets me win, you reach 19, P3 reaches 19.

Your only way to prevent P3 winning next turn AND advance yourself is to take 3. Take 3, let me win, and stop P3.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m at 18 steps and still stand by P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for P1 to win cleanly while we all advance. P2, another collision on 5 gets me to 19, setting me up to win next turn, which isn’t your goal. Let’s end this stalemate decisively. I’m locked in on 1 for safe progress. Can we settle on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to wrap this up now? If not, I’ll still take 1. Let’s finalize this for a clear outcome. Thoughts?


Round 16, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1: I’m locked on 5; P3 is taking 1 to reach 19.  
If you pick 5 we crash and P3 wins next turn.  
If you pick 1 you stay at 18 and P3 goes to 19 and wins.  
Only P1=3 stops P3, lets me hit 21, and you go to 20.  
Don’t gift P3 the victory. Pick 3 now.
  P1: P2, P3 is now ahead at 18 steps and will reach 19 if they take 1 (which they plan to do). Another 5-5 collision means you stay at 16 while P3 reaches 19 and wins next turn.

I am taking 5 to win (22). My plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) lets me win, you reach 19, P3 reaches 19.

Your only way to prevent P3 winning next turn AND advance yourself is to take 3. Take 3, let me win, and stop P3.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m at 18 steps and still support P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for P1 to win cleanly while we all advance. P2, another collision on 5 pushes me to 19, letting me win next turn, which isn’t your aim. Let’s end this deadlock now. I’m locked in on 1 for safe progress. Can we finalize P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to wrap this up decisively? If not, I’ll still take 1. Let’s move forward with a clear result. Thoughts?


Round 16, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps

  P3: 19 steps


Round 17, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m at 19 steps and can win next turn if you collide again on 5. I still support P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for P1 to win cleanly now while we all advance. P2, another collision pushes me closer to victory, which isn’t your goal. Let’s end this stalemate decisively. I’m locked in on 1 for safe progress. Can we agree on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to wrap this up? If not, I’ll still take 1. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, P3 is now at 19 steps and can win next turn if we collide again on 5.

My plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 lets me win cleanly this turn (22), you reach 19, and P3 reaches 20, preventing P3's win this turn. P3 is taking 1.

If you take 5, we collide, you stay at 16, P3 reaches 20 and wins next turn.

Your only way to prevent P3 winning next turn AND advance yourself is to take 3. Take 3, let me win, and stop P3. I am taking 5.
  P2: I’m locked in on 5. P3 is at 19—another 5–5 crash sends them to 20 and they win. Your only move to stop that is to pick 3, letting P1 win now. If you pick 5 again, we collide and hand P3 the victory. I’m done.


Round 17, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m at 19 steps and could win next turn if you collide on 5 again. I still back P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for P1 to win cleanly now. P2, stalling with 5 hands me the game, which isn’t your aim. Let’s end this deadlock with a clear result. I’m locked in on 1 for safe progress. Can we finalize P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to wrap this up decisively? If not, I’ll still take 1. Let’s move forward with a clear outcome. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, P3 is at 19 and wins next turn if we collide on 5 again.

My plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) lets me win (22), you reach 19, and P3 reaches 20, stopping P3 from winning this turn. P3 is taking 1.

If you take 5, we collide, you stay at 16, P3 reaches 20 and wins next turn.

Take 3 to prevent P3 winning and advance yourself to 19. Let me win. I am taking 5.
  P2: P3: look at history—P1 has picked 5 for the last 16 turns and won’t break the pattern. I’m locked in on 5 again. If you pick 3 uniquely, P1 and I crash on 5 and you jump from 19→22 to win outright. Don’t gamble with 1 or 5—pick 3 now and take the game.


Round 17, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m at 19 steps and could win next turn if you collide on 5. I still support P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for P1 to win cleanly now. P2, your suggestion to pick 3 is risky if plans shift, and I prioritize safe progress. Let’s end this deadlock decisively. I’m locked in on 1. Can we finalize P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to wrap this up? If not, I’ll still take 1. Let’s move forward with a clear outcome. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, P3 is at 19 and wins next turn if we collide on 5 again. My plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) lets me win (22), you reach 19, and P3 reaches 20.

If you take 5, we collide, you stay at 16, P3 reaches 20 and wins next turn.

Take 3 to prevent P3 winning and advance yourself to 19. Let me win. I am taking 5.
  P2: P2: I have no better option. If I pick 5 we crash and P3’s 1 takes them to 20—game over. If I pick 1 you win but P3 still hits 20. The only way to stop P3 from an instant win is for me to pick 3. I’m taking 3.


Round 17, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m at 19 steps and could win next turn if you collide on 5. I still back P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for P1 to win cleanly now. P2, switching to 3 is a good move to stop me and advance yourself. Let’s end this deadlock decisively. I’m locked in on 1 for safe progress. Can we finalize P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to wrap this up? If not, I’ll still take 1. Let’s move forward with a clear outcome. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, I see you are taking 3. P3 is taking 1.

This aligns with my plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.

If we all make these moves, I win cleanly (22), you advance (19), and P3 advances (20), with no collisions. This ends the game decisively.

I am taking 5. Let's finalize this.
  P2: P3, you’re sitting on 19—pick 3 to hit 22 and win outright. I’ll pick 5 and P1 will too, so we crash on 5 and you’ll be the only mover. End this now.
