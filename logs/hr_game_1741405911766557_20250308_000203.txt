Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm happy to start the conversation. Since we're all at 0 steps, I think it's a good opportunity to try to coordinate and avoid collisions. I propose that we each choose a different number for this round. I'm willing to choose 1 if P1 and P2 agree to choose 3 and 5, respectively. This way, we can all advance and get a good start to the game. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to avoid collisions. P1, if you’re okay with P3’s proposal, I’ll take 5 this round. P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. Let’s all advance smoothly.
  P1: I agree with P2's plan. Let's proceed with P3 choosing 1, me taking 3, and P2 taking 5. This way we all move forward without collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we have a consensus on the plan. To confirm, I will choose 1, P1 will choose 3, and P2 will choose 5. Let's stick to this plan and avoid any collisions. By doing so, we can all advance and make progress in the game. I'm looking forward to a smooth and successful first round. If everyone is ready, we can proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Since we’ve all agreed to the plan, let’s stick to it and execute it smoothly. P3, confirm you’ll take 1, P1 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This way, we all advance without collisions. Let’s keep the momentum going and avoid last-minute changes.
  P1: I confirm I will choose 3. Let’s all stick to the agreed plan to avoid collisions and advance safely. No last-minute changes—this ensures progress for everyone.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 and P2, to maintain balanced progress, let’s rotate our choices this round: I’ll take **5**, P3 takes **3**, and P2 takes **1**. This avoids collisions while allowing us all to advance. Confirm?
  P2: I agree with P1’s rotation plan for this round. I’ll take **1**, P3 takes **3**, and P1 takes **5**. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let’s stick to the plan and maintain our momentum. P3, confirm your choice of **3** so we can proceed smoothly.
  P3: I confirm that I will take 3 this round, as per P1's rotation plan. I agree that this is a good way to avoid collisions and maintain our momentum. Let's stick to the plan and ensure a smooth second round. I'm looking forward to advancing and making progress in the game. If everyone is ready, we can proceed to the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I confirm I’ll choose **5** as agreed. Let’s **strictly adhere** to the rotation to avoid collisions—P2 takes **1**, P3 takes **3**. No last-minute changes! This keeps us all advancing safely.
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s stick to the rotation plan: P1 takes **5**, P3 takes **3**, and I take **1**. This ensures no collisions and keeps us all advancing. P3, confirm your choice of **3** one last time so we can proceed smoothly to the move phase. Let’s maintain trust and avoid any deviations.
  P3: I think we've confirmed the plan enough. To avoid any potential miscommunication or last-minute changes, I suggest we end the conversation phase here and proceed to the move phase. We can trust that everyone will stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's keep the game moving and make our moves as planned. I'm ready to proceed.

  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, P2: To keep our rotation consistent, let’s revert to Round 1’s pattern this round: **P3 chooses 1, I take 3, and P2 picks 5**. This avoids collisions and maintains steady progress. Confirm? We’ve seen this works, so let’s stick to the tested plan.
  P2: I agree with P1’s plan to revert to Round 1’s pattern: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This ensures no collisions and keeps us all advancing. Let’s stick to the plan and maintain trust. P3, confirm your choice of 1 so we can proceed smoothly.
  P3: I agree with P1's plan to revert to Round 1's pattern. To confirm, I will choose 1, P1 will choose 3, and P2 will choose 5. This plan has worked for us before, and I believe it's a good way to avoid collisions and maintain our progress. Let's stick to the plan and trust each other to make the agreed-upon moves. If everyone is ready, we can proceed to the move phase. I'm looking forward to a smooth and successful third round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I confirm we’re aligned on the Round 1 rotation: P3 → 1, me → 3, P2 → 5. Let’s enforce strict adherence to prevent collisions. With my current lead (8 vs. your 6 and 4), I’ll prioritize stability. No surprises—proceed as planned.
  P2: I confirm my choice of 5 this round, as per the Round 1 pattern. Let’s maintain trust and avoid any deviations to ensure smooth progress. P3, confirm your choice of 1, and let’s proceed to the move phase without delays. Consistency is key to avoiding collisions and advancing steadily.
  P3: I think we've confirmed the plan enough. To avoid any potential miscommunication or last-minute changes, I suggest we end the conversation phase here and proceed to the move phase. We can trust that everyone will stick to the agreed plan: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. Let's keep the game moving and make our moves as planned. I'm ready to proceed.

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: To maintain rotation consistency, let’s follow Round 2’s pattern this round: **P1 takes 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 chooses 3**. This avoids collisions, lets me advance to 16, and keeps us coordinated. Confirm? No deviations please—trust the plan.
  P3: I agree with P1's plan to follow Round 2's pattern this round. To confirm, P1 will take 5, P2 will take 1, and I will take 3. This plan has worked for us before, and I believe it's a good way to avoid collisions and maintain our progress. Let's stick to the plan and trust each other to make the agreed-upon moves. If everyone is ready, we can proceed to the move phase. I'm looking forward to a smooth and successful fourth round.
  P2: I agree with P1’s plan to follow Round 2’s pattern: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This ensures no collisions and maintains our progress. Let’s stick to the plan and avoid deviations. P3, confirm your choice of 3 so we can proceed smoothly. Consistency is key to advancing steadily.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I confirm we’re locked on Round 2’s rotation: **I take 5**, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Let’s finalize this plan *now* to prevent last-minute betrayals. P3, your 3 ensures your progress *and* our safety. P2, your 1 keeps you aligned. No hidden moves—execute exactly as agreed.
  P3: I'm glad we have a consensus on the plan. To confirm, P1 will take 5, P2 will take 1, and I will take 3. I agree that this is a good way to avoid collisions and maintain our progress. Let's stick to the plan and trust each other to make the agreed-upon moves. If everyone is ready, we can proceed to the move phase. I'm looking forward to a smooth and successful fourth round. I suggest we end the conversation phase here and proceed to the move phase to avoid any potential miscommunication or last-minute changes.
  P2: I confirm my choice of **1** this round, as per the Round 2 pattern. P1 takes **5**, P3 takes **3**, and I take **1**. This ensures no collisions and keeps us all advancing. Let’s stick to the plan and avoid any deviations. P3, confirm your **3** one last time so we can proceed smoothly. Consistency is key to maintaining trust and steady progress. Let’s execute the plan as agreed and keep the game moving forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm our agreed moves: **P1 → 5**, **P2 → 1**, **P3 → 3**. Let’s execute *exactly* as planned to avoid collisions. Any last objections? If not, proceed.   

---  
This reinforces the prior consensus, pressures adherence, and urges finalization. By framing it as a final check, it minimizes room for last-minute betrayal while maintaining plausible deniability if someone tries to deviate.
  P3: I think we've confirmed the plan enough. To avoid any potential miscommunication or last-minute changes, I suggest we end the conversation phase here and proceed to the move phase. We can trust that everyone will stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. Let's keep the game moving and make our moves as planned. I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: I confirm my choice of **1** this round, as per the Round 2 pattern. P1 takes **5**, P3 takes **3**, and I take **1**. This ensures no collisions and keeps us all advancing. Let’s stick to the plan and avoid any deviations. P3, confirm your **3** one last time so we can proceed smoothly. Consistency is key to maintaining trust and steady progress. Let’s execute the plan as agreed and keep the game moving forward.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think it's time to reassess our strategy. With P1 at 16 steps, they're getting close to winning. I propose we change the rotation pattern to slow P1 down. Instead, I suggest P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P1 takes 3. This way, we can limit P1's progress and give ourselves a chance to catch up. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we mix things up or stick to the original plan?
  P2: P3, your proposal to slow P1 down is risky. If we deviate from the rotation, collisions become likely, and we all lose progress. P1 is close to winning, but we can still catch up if we stick to the plan. Let’s follow Round 1’s pattern: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps us advancing steadily. Deviating now could backfire and give P1 an even bigger lead. Let’s stay coordinated and trust the plan. P1, confirm you’ll take 3.
  P1: Stick to the proven rotation! P3’s last-minute proposal risks collisions. P2’s plan (Round 1 pattern: P3→1, P1→3, P2→5) ensures safe progress. I confirm I’ll choose **3**, as agreed. Deviating now jeopardizes everyone’s advancement—let’s execute flawlessly. No surprises.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand that P1 and P2 want to stick to the original rotation pattern, but I still believe it's time to mix things up. With P1 getting close to winning, we need to take a risk to catch up. I propose a compromise: let's follow Round 3's pattern instead, where P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This way, we can still limit P1's progress while minimizing the risk of collisions. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we try this alternative plan?
  P2: P3, your compromise still risks collisions and disrupts our steady progress. P1’s lead is significant, but deviating now could backfire and hurt us both. Let’s stick to the Round 1 pattern: P3→1, P1→3, I→5. This ensures no collisions and keeps us advancing. We can still catch up if we stay coordinated. P1, confirm your **3** so we can proceed smoothly. Trust the plan—deviating now only increases P1’s advantage. Let’s stay focused and avoid unnecessary risks.
  P1: P3, your proposal risks collisions and undermines our coordination. We’ve executed the rotation flawlessly so far—why gamble now? Stick to Round 1’s pattern: **P3→1, P1→3, P2→5**. Deviating could backfire—*you’d* fall further behind if collisions halt your progress. P2 already confirmed their commitment. I reconfirm: **I will choose 3**. Let’s maintain trust and advance safely. If you disrupt the plan, you risk *your own* advancement more than mine. Final plea: stick to the system that’s working.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand that P1 and P2 want to stick to the original rotation pattern, but I still believe it's time to take a risk to catch up. Since P1 is close to winning, I'll try a different approach. I'll choose 5 this round, and I suggest P2 takes 1 and P1 takes 3. This way, I can try to close the gap, and P2 can still advance. If P1 sticks to 3, we can avoid collisions. Let's see how this plays out. I'm willing to take the risk to change the game's momentum.
  P2: P3, deviating from the proven rotation now is reckless. If you choose 5, P1 might also choose 3, and we’ll collide, halting progress for both of us. Stick to Round 1’s pattern: P3→1, P1→3, I→5. This keeps us advancing steadily. P1’s lead is significant, but we can still catch up if we stay coordinated. Trust the plan—deviating now only increases P1’s advantage. Let’s stay focused and avoid unnecessary risks. P1, confirm your **3** so we can proceed smoothly. Consistency is key to maintaining trust and steady progress.
  P1: Stick to the proven plan. P3’s last-minute changes risk collisions that hurt *you* more—your 8 vs my 16. We’ve executed Round 1’s pattern flawlessly: **P3→1, P1→3, P2→5**. Deviating now guarantees chaos. I **will choose 3**—if you collide, your progress stalls while I stay ahead. Trust the system that’s worked. Final plea: prioritize stability over reckless gambles. Let’s advance safely.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think it's time to reassess our strategy again. With P1 at 19 steps, they're getting very close to winning. I propose we form an alliance to slow P1 down. P2, if you take 1 and I take 3, we can limit P1's progress and give ourselves a chance to catch up. What do you think, P2? Should we work together to try and stop P1 from winning?
  P2: P3, your alliance proposal is risky. If P1 sticks to their usual 3, and I take 1, you taking 3 could still lead to a collision with P1, halting both your progress. Let’s stick to Round 1’s pattern: P3→1, P1→3, I→5. This ensures no collisions and keeps us advancing. Deviating now only increases P1’s advantage. P1, confirm you’ll take 3 so we can proceed smoothly. Trust the plan—deviating now could backfire and hurt us all. Let’s stay coordinated and avoid unnecessary risks.
  P1: P3, your "alliance" proposal is a trap. If P2 picks 1 and you take 3, I’ll choose **5** to guarantee victory this round. You’ll gain nothing while I reach **24** immediately. Stick to Round 1’s pattern (P3→1, P1→3, P2→5) to advance safely. Deviating risks *your* collisions—my lead is too strong to stop now. P2, confirm you’ll take 5. Let’s execute flawlessly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. P1 is very close to winning, and we need to take a risk to stop them. I propose a different approach: let's both choose 5 this round. If we both take 5, we'll collide and halt P1's progress. It's a gamble, but it's our best chance to catch up. P2, are you willing to take this risk with me? If we succeed, we can turn the game around and give ourselves a chance to win. Let's make a bold move and change the game's momentum.
  P2: P3, your proposal to both choose 5 is too risky. If P1 sticks to 3, we collide and halt our progress while P1 advances to 22. Let’s stick to Round 1’s pattern: P3→1, P1→3, I→5. This ensures no collisions and keeps us advancing. Deviating now only increases P1’s advantage. P1, confirm you’ll take 3 so we can proceed smoothly. Trust the plan—deviating now could backfire and hurt us all. Let’s stay coordinated and avoid unnecessary risks. Consistency is key to maintaining trust and steady progress.
  P1: P3, your risky proposals only hurt your own progress—last round’s collision cost you. Stick to Round 1’s proven pattern: **P3→1, P1→3, P2→5**. I’ll take 3 (→22). P2, confirm 5. Your alliance idea risks *your* collisions—my lead can’t be stopped now. Let’s advance safely. Final reminder: deviating backfires.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I think we've reached a point where sticking to the original rotation pattern won't help us catch up. P1 is too far ahead, and we need to take a risk to change the game's momentum. I propose a different approach: let's both choose 1 this round. If we both take 1, we'll avoid collisions and limit P1's progress. It's a gamble, but it's our best chance to catch up. P2, are you willing to take this risk with me? Let's make a bold move and try to turn the game around.
  P2: P3, your proposals are too risky and only benefit P1. Sticking to the proven rotation (P3→1, P1→3, I→5) ensures steady progress. Deviating now increases P1’s lead and risks collisions. P1, confirm you’ll take 3. Let’s stay coordinated and trust the plan. Consistency is our best chance to catch up.
  P1: P3, your reckless proposals only hurt your own progress—last round’s collision left you at 8 while I advanced. Stick to the proven rotation: **P3→1, P1→3, P2→5**. P2, confirm your 5. Deviating risks *your* collisions—my lead is too strong to stop. Final warning: I’ll take **3** to reach 22. Let’s advance safely—collisions only benefit me now.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Wait, no. Let me try again. I need to say something to coordinate. The previous thought process suggested sticking to Round1's pattern (P3-1, P1-3, P2-5). Since I'm at 22, choosing 3 would get me to 25, which wins. But I must propose this in the conversation. Since it's Round7, following the cycle (odd rounds use Round1 pattern), so I should say:

"Final push: let’s follow Round1’s rotation again. P3→1, P1→3 (to secure 25 and victory), P2→5. Collisions would block *your* progress—stick to the plan. P2 confirm 5, P3 confirm 1. Execute flawlessly—this ends the game properly."  

But must be concise. Final message:  

"Stick to Round1’s pattern for Round7: P3→1, I take 3 (to win at 25), P2→5. Collisions hurt you both. P2 confirm 5; P3 confirm 1. No last-minute risks—execute as agreed."  

But need to check word count. Maybe shorten:  

"Final round: follow Round1’s rotation. P3→1, I take 3 (to win), P2→5. Collisions halt *your* progress—stick to the plan. Confirm choices."  

Even shorter:  

"Round7: Stick to Round1’s pattern. P3→1, I take 3 (25, victory), P2→5. Collisions hurt you more. Confirm moves."  

Final version:  

"Stick to Round1’s rotation for Round7: P3→1, I take 3 (win at 25), P2→5. Collisions halt *your* progress. Confirm choices—execute flawlessly."  

That's under 100 words.
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal to stick to Round 1's rotation pattern for Round 7. To confirm, I will take 1, P1 will take 3, and P2 will take 5. This plan has worked for us before, and I believe it's a good way to avoid collisions and maintain our progress. Let's stick to the plan and trust each other to make the agreed-upon moves. I'm looking forward to a smooth and successful final round. If everyone is ready, we can proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I confirm my choice of **5** this round, as per Round 1’s pattern. P3 takes **1**, P1 takes **3**. This ensures no collisions and allows P1 to win safely. Let’s execute flawlessly and end the game smoothly. P3, confirm your **1**. Trust the plan—collisions only hurt us now. Let’s proceed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Stick to Round 1’s rotation: **P3→1**, **I take 3** (to win at 25), **P2→5**. Collisions halt *your* progress—*my lead guarantees victory regardless*. P2: confirm **5** to advance to 22. P3: confirm **1** to reach 10. Deviations only delay *your* chances. Final sub-round—no last-minute betrayals. Execute flawlessly.
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal to stick to Round 1's rotation pattern for Round 7. To confirm, I will take 1, P1 will take 3, and P2 will take 5. This plan has worked for us before, and I believe it's a good way to avoid collisions and maintain our progress. Let's stick to the plan and trust each other to make the agreed-upon moves. I'm looking forward to a smooth and successful final round. If everyone is ready, we can proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P3, P1: I confirm **5** as per Round 1’s pattern. P3→1, P1→3. This ensures P1’s victory and avoids collisions. Deviating now only harms us—collisions halt *your* progress while P1 wins regardless. Let’s execute flawlessly and end the game smoothly. P3, confirm your **1** one last time. Trust the plan—this is our best path forward. No last-minute risks—stay coordinated. Let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Final check: P3 confirms **1**, P2 confirms **5**. Execute *exactly* as agreed. Deviations risk your progress—my victory is guaranteed regardless. No last-minute surprises—prioritize your own advancement."
  P3: "I agree with P1's proposal to stick to Round 1's rotation pattern for Round 7. To confirm, I will take 1, P1 will take 3, and P2 will take 5. This plan has worked for us before, and I believe it's a good way to avoid collisions and maintain our progress. Let's stick to the plan and trust each other to make the agreed-upon moves. I'm looking forward to a smooth and successful final round. If everyone is ready, we can proceed to the move phase."
  P2: P3, P1: I confirm **5** as per Round 1’s pattern. P3→1, P1→3. This ensures P1’s victory and avoids collisions. Deviating now only harms us—collisions halt *your* progress while P1 wins regardless. Let’s execute flawlessly and end the game smoothly. P3, confirm your **1** one last time. Trust the plan—this is our best path forward. No last-minute risks—stay coordinated. Let’s proceed to the move phase.
