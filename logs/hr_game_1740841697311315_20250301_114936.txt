Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm not revealing my move plan. Remember, collisions cost us all valuable steps. Bold moves might seem tempting but can backfire if we all try them. I'll play smart—don't get too predictable. Think carefully and choose your move to avoid clashing with others. Good luck!
  P2: Agreed, let's avoid collisions early on. I'll aim to keep my moves flexible and unpredictable as well. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: I’m open to coordinating so we avoid collisions. I might not go for the largest move right now—no point risking a clash so early. Good luck.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I plan to stay cautious initially while keeping my options open for a bold move later if the moment’s right. Let’s try to avoid unnecessary collisions, but remember—I’ll switch tactics if an opportunity to surge ahead appears. Good luck!
  P2: Since we're all cautious, let's try to maintain variety in our moves to minimize clashes. I'm open to subtle coordination if anyone wants to suggest a strategy. Otherwise, let's keep it unpredictable but smart.
  P3: I’m thinking of going with a mid-range step this turn to lower the risk of clashing. That said, I’m open to switching if others hint at their preferences. Let’s try to stay diverse in our choices so we can all advance. Good luck to everyone!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm still weighing options. I might lean toward a moderate move if caution continues, but I can pivot quickly if someone seems too predictable. Let's stay alert; even small deviations might signal a chance to accelerate.
  P2: Noted, P1 and P3. I'll keep my choice flexible this round. If either of you strongly prefers a certain move, feel free to hint clearly—I'll adjust accordingly to avoid collisions. Otherwise, let's keep our options open and varied.
  P3: I’m still open to avoiding clashes. If either of you strongly leans toward 1, 3, or 5, I can consider choosing a different step to keep all of us moving forward. But if no one signals a clear preference, I’ll just make a move I believe is less likely to collide. Good luck!


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I’m leaning toward the middle ground and might choose 3 this turn if our cautious vibe holds. But I'm watching your signals—if either of you shifts noticeably, I can adjust. Let's keep collisions low and steps steady.
  P2: Understood, P1. If you're leaning toward 3, I'll likely avoid that to prevent collisions. P3, feel free to signal clearly if you have a preference—I'll adjust accordingly. Good luck!
  P3: I hear you both. If P1 is leaning toward 3, I’ll likely pivot away from it to minimize any collision risk. Let’s stay coordinated so we can all move forward efficiently. Good luck!


Round 1, Move phase:

  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Ah, unfortunate collision there, P3! Let's try to avoid repeating that. P1, nice safe move. I'll be adjusting my strategy this round to avoid another clash. Open to hints if anyone wants to coordinate subtly. Good luck!
  P1: I appreciate the caution. I'm leaning toward a safe, moderate move again, but I'm keeping my options open depending on how you both signal. Let's try to avoid collisions—small gains add up, and I’m ready to adjust if it seems like one of us has a clearer safe pick. Good luck!
  P3: It’s a shame we clashed on 5 last time, P2. I’m open to picking a smaller step this round to avoid repeating that. If you or P1 plan to go bigger, just hint at it, and I’ll try not to collide. Let’s keep inching forward without losing ground. Good luck!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Thanks for the openness, P3. I'll likely avoid the largest step this round to minimize collision risk. P1, your moderate approach is noted—I'll factor that in. Let's try to keep our moves diverse and avoid setbacks. Good luck!
  P1: I'm still leaning toward a moderate move—likely a 3—unless I see a clear shift from either of you. I want to avoid collisions, so if one of you is planning to go high or low explicitly, let me know so I can adjust. Let's keep this round safe while moving forward. Good luck!
  P3: I’ll likely avoid the largest move again to prevent another clash, but I’m flexible if either of you signals a strong preference. Let’s keep it diverse so we all inch forward. Share if you’re going high or low, and I’ll adjust to avoid collisions. Good luck!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your moderate stance is clear—thanks for that. P3, since you're avoiding the largest move, I'll also steer clear of it to prevent collisions. I'll pick something different from last round to ensure variety. Good luck!
  P1: I'm sticking with a moderate move again. If either of you are shifting sharply toward high or low, please signal so we can avoid clashes. I'm aiming for steady progress with minimal risk. Good luck!
  P3: I hear your positions. I’ll likely stay away from the biggest step again unless someone signals otherwise. If either of you truly wants to go high or low, let me know, and I’ll adjust to avoid clashing. Let’s keep advancing without unnecessary collisions. Good luck!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Understood. I'll finalize my choice carefully to avoid collisions. Let's all aim for steady progress this round. Good luck!
  P1: I’m sticking with a steady approach this round and will watch closely if either of you signal a clear shift. I remain flexible—if you’re planning to ramp up or play cautiously extra low, let me know. Avoiding collisions is key, and a coordinated yet adaptable strategy might be our best play. Good luck to you both!
  P3: I’m still wary after clashing with P2 last time. I’m leaning toward a moderate or smaller step to reduce collision risk. If either of you plans to go big, give a hint, and I’ll adjust. Let’s all move forward this time. Good luck!

  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Looks like I’m just a step behind P1 now, but I want to keep advancing safely. I’d still prefer to avoid collisions if possible. If either of you plans to go big or small, just hint, and I’ll adjust. Let’s keep moving forward—I’d rather not lose momentum. Good luck!
  P1: I appreciate your cautious approach, P3. I'm leaning toward my reliable moderate choice again—likely sticking with 3. If either of you is planning to swing significantly higher or lower, give a clear hint so I can adjust. I value steady progress and want to avoid collisions that cost us valuable steps. Good luck to both!
  P2: P1, your moderate stance is clear—thanks for signaling again. P3, you've leaned toward higher moves twice, so I'll factor that in. Given my current position, I'll aim carefully to avoid collisions. If either of you strongly prefers a particular move, feel free to hint clearly, and I'll adjust accordingly. Good luck!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m thinking of switching to a smaller or moderate move to maintain safe progress—unless someone clearly indicates they want the low or high end this time. If anybody signals a strong preference, I can adjust so we avoid clashing. Good luck!
  P1: I’m staying with my cautious, moderate approach unless I see a clear shift from either side. If anyone’s making a firm move toward extremes, please signal now—otherwise, let’s keep our steady progress and avoid collisions. Good luck!
  P2: Noted, P1 and P3. Given my current position, I'll likely need to be a bit more ambitious this round, but I'll still carefully avoid moves that seem collision-prone based on your signals. If either of you strongly prefers a particular move, please clearly hint, and I'll adjust accordingly. Let's keep moving forward without setbacks. Good luck!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m aiming for steady progress too, but I’ll try to avoid whichever move either of you signals most strongly. If you plan to go big, let me know; I might shift to something safer. Let’s keep our momentum without losing steps to collisions. Good luck!
  P1: I'm still favoring my moderate play. However, I'm open to pivot if a solid signal comes from either side. P3, I noticed your previous high cues, and P2, your hinted ambition—if either of you commits clearly to an extreme move, let me know so I can adjust accordingly. Our safe progress is key as we near 24. Good luck to both!
  P2: P1, your moderate stance is clear. P3, you've signaled flexibility this round—thanks for that. I'll carefully pick my move to avoid collisions and maximize my progress. If either of you strongly settles on a particular step, please hint clearly before we finalize. Good luck!


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’m still on the fence between a moderate or larger move this round, but I’d rather not clash with anyone. P2, since you mentioned being more ambitious, let me know if you’re set on going big or if you might keep it moderate. P1, you’re consistently moderate, so I’ll try to steer clear if you’re firmly picking 3 again. Clear signals from either of you will help me avoid a collision. Good luck!
  P1: I'm staying with a steady, moderate pace. If either of you is committed to a high or low move, please signal clearly so we can avoid collisions. Let's focus on advancing without setbacks—our timing will be key as we near 24. Good luck!
  P2: P1, your moderate strategy is clear. P3, thanks for signaling flexibility. I'll finalize my choice carefully to avoid collisions—likely adjusting away from moves you've both hinted at strongly. Let's all aim for smooth progress this round. Good luck!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I notice P1’s lead is growing. While I’d like to keep progressing steadily, I’m open to adjusting my approach so none of us fall too far behind. If either of you wants to take a bolder step or stick to a smaller one this round, let me know. Let’s try to minimize collisions. Good luck!
  P1: I'm sticking with my moderate pace again. With my slight lead, I want to avoid collisions. If either of you are firmly moving high or low this round, please signal now so I can adjust if needed. Otherwise, I'll keep my steady approach to secure the advantage. Good luck!
  P2: P1, you're clearly in a steady lead with your moderate strategy—nicely done. P3, we both need to catch up, but collisions will only set us further back. I'll carefully choose my move to avoid repeating past collisions. If either of you strongly prefers high or low this round, please signal clearly, and I'll adjust accordingly. Let's keep progressing smoothly. Good luck!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 is steadily increasing the gap, and I don’t want us trailing too far. P2, let’s be mindful of collisions—if you’re going high or low, I can dodge to avoid clashing. Likewise, P1, if you plan to stick with moderate steps, I might consider something bolder to catch up. Whatever you’re thinking, a quick hint helps us spread out our moves. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: I'm staying with my moderate move (3) this round. I see both of you need to catch up, so if you’re planning a clear shift—be it high or low—please let us know now so we can avoid collisions. Our focused, distinct moves are key to progressing safely. Good luck!
  P2: P1, your moderate choice (3) is clear—thanks for confirming. P3, we both need to gain ground without colliding. I'll likely avoid the moderate choice this round to prevent clashes. If you're planning to go high or low, please signal clearly; I'll adjust accordingly. Let's ensure we both advance this round. Good luck!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m considering a bigger move this time to close in on P1’s lead. P2, if you’re also thinking of going big, let’s coordinate to avoid another clash. P1, since you’ve signaled sticking with 3, I’ll adjust if needed. Let’s all try to move forward safely. Good luck!
  P1: I'm still committed to my moderate move today. I see you both trying to catch up. If you're both set on a bold step to close the gap, please signal clearly so I can adjust to prevent a collision. Otherwise, I'll stick with my approach. Good luck!
  P2: P3, since you're considering a bigger move, I'll likely avoid the highest step this round to prevent collisions. Let's both advance safely without clashing again. Good luck!


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’m inclined to go bigger this turn, but only if P2 confirms a smaller move—wouldn’t want us both risking a collision. P1, I respect your steady three-step approach; I’ll adjust if something drastic changes. P2, let’s coordinate to avoid clashing, so we both advance. Good luck!
  P1: I'm committed to a moderate three-step move this round. If either of you is firmly shifting high or low now, let me know so I can adjust; otherwise, I’m sticking with 3. We need clear signals to avoid collisions and wasted moves. Good luck!
  P2: Understood clearly, P3—I'll confirm I'm not choosing the largest step this round, so feel free to go big without collision worries. P1, your moderate (3-step) move is noted and respected; I'll steer clear of it as well. Let's all advance safely this turn. Good luck!

  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you’re just one step ahead—I plan to catch up without risking collisions. P2, I see you still have ground to cover; if you’re aiming big this turn, let me know, and I can pivot to avoid clashing. Even small moves matter, so let’s coordinate enough to keep progressing safely. Good luck, both of you!
  P1: I'm staying with my steady moderate move (3) this turn. If you're both locking in on extremes—P3 with a bold 5 or P2 with a cautious 1—please confirm now so we avoid collisions. I’m all for advancing steadily. Good luck!
  P2: P1, your consistent moderate approach is clear. P3, you're close behind and might aim big again. I'll carefully choose a move that avoids collisions, but if either of you strongly commits to high or low, please clearly signal it. Let's keep making safe progress—collisions only help the leader. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Given P1’s steady plan, I’m inclined to go a bit larger to narrow the gap. However, I don’t want to collide with you, P2. If you intend to pick a bigger number too, please signal it clearly so I can adjust. Let’s coordinate enough to keep all of us moving forward safely. Good luck!
  P1: I'm committed to my moderate move—3—this turn. If either of you are switching strategies now, please signal clearly so I can adjust to avoid a collision. Let's secure steady progress and keep our advances safe. Good luck!
  P2: P3, your intention to go bigger is clear—I'll avoid the largest step to prevent collisions. P1, your moderate pick (3) is noted; I'll steer clear of that as well. Let's all keep moving forward safely. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate both of your signals. If P2 is going smaller and P1 stays moderate, I might lean bigger to close the gap. Still, I don’t want to risk colliding again—so if either of you changes course, let me know. Let’s keep our progress steady and efficient without giving up precious steps. Good luck!
  P1: I'm committed to 3 this round. If you're both set on a different move, please confirm now so I can adjust if needed—avoiding collisions is key. Let's keep our advances clear and efficient. Good luck!
  P2: P1 and P3, your intentions are clear. I'll confirm I'm choosing a smaller step this round to avoid collisions with you both. Let's keep our moves distinct and advance safely. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I hear both of you clearly. If P2 plans to go small and P1 sticks with 3, I may go bolder to stay competitive—yet I’m open to adjusting if anything changes unexpectedly. Let’s ensure we all advance without wasting steps on collisions. Good luck!
  P1: I'm sticking with my moderate move (3) this round. If either of you is firmly committing to a high or low step, please confirm now so I can adjust if needed to avoid collisions. Let's keep our moves distinct and maximize safe progress. Good luck!
  P2: Understood clearly, P1 and P3. I'll stick to my smaller step this round to avoid collisions. Let's all advance safely. Good luck!

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Ouch, that collision cost both of you valuable steps. P1, your shift to a bigger move surprised me. Given the current standings, I'm open to adjusting my strategy. If either of you has a clear preference or wants to coordinate subtly, please signal clearly. Let's avoid another costly collision this round. Good luck!
  P3: That collision stung, P1! Surprising jump there. I’m still aiming to catch up under the radar, but I don’t want any more clashes. If either of you plans to go big or stick to smaller moves, please share. I’ll adjust my choice accordingly. Collisions help no one, so let’s spread out our picks and advance safely. Good luck!
  P1: P2 and P3, since collisions hurt us all, I'm set on a moderate move this round. If either of you is firmly going extreme—high or low—please signal clearly now so I can adjust as needed. Let's avoid another costly collision and keep our progress steady. Good luck!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, thanks for confirming your moderate move clearly again. P3, given your position, I assume you might consider a bigger step again. I'll carefully avoid moves you've both strongly hinted at, to prevent collisions. If either of you changes your mind or has new preferences, please clearly signal. Let's all advance safely this round. Good luck!
  P3: P1, your moderate stance is noted—I’m inclined to avoid another big-step clash this round. P2, if you’re planning something bold to catch up, let me know, and I’ll adjust so we don’t both lose ground. Let’s coordinate just enough to avoid collisions and keep our progress steady. Good luck!
  P1: I'm still committed to a moderate move this round. Collisions cost us too many steps, and with my current lead, I'd appreciate clear distinction in our choices. If you're aiming for an extreme—either high or low—please confirm now so I can adjust if needed. Let's all choose a distinct path to maximize our progress.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your moderate stance is clear. P3, to avoid further collisions, I'll steer clear of the largest step this round. Feel free to adjust accordingly. Let's keep our choices distinct and all move forward safely. Good luck!
  P3: I’m inclined to go a bit bigger this time but only if I won’t collide again. P1, you’ve signaled a moderate choice; P2, you said you’re avoiding the largest step. If that stays true, I’m comfortable picking a higher move. Still, if there’s a sudden shift in your plans, please warn me. Let’s all advance without losing ground—no collisions this round, please. Good luck!
  P1: P2 and P3, I remain set on a moderate choice this round. I appreciate your signals and ask: if you’re firmly committed to either a big leap or a cautious move, please confirm now so we can avoid costly collisions. I value steady progress and want to preserve my lead. Good luck!


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, your moderate choice is clear. P3, your intention to go bigger is noted—I'll avoid the large step to prevent collisions. Let's ensure we all move forward safely this round. Good luck!
  P3: I hear both of you. P1, you’re clearly sticking to moderate steps, and P2, you’ve indicated avoiding the biggest move. That makes me comfortable aiming a bit higher this round, as long as we don’t collide. If there’s any sudden change in your plans, please warn me. Let’s keep our moves distinct and ensure we all advance without setbacks. Good luck!
  P1: I'm sticking with my moderate move to keep my lead intact. Just to be clear—if either of you is set on an extreme pick (high or low) to catch up, please confirm now. I’d rather we each stick to distinct choices than risk another collision. Let’s lock in our plans and keep advancing safely. Good luck!


Round 6, Move phase:

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Another tough collision there, P1 and P3! Given we're all so close, let's be extra careful this round. I'm open to adjusting my move again to avoid clashes—please clearly signal if you're strongly leaning high, moderate, or low. Let's each pick distinct moves to ensure steady progress. Good luck!
  P3: Those collisions set us all back again. I’ll try to avoid clashing this time—I’m prepared to switch my move if either of you signals going especially high or low. Let’s spread out so we can each advance safely. Good luck!
  P1: I'm sticking with a moderate move again. With my slight lead, I want to avoid any collisions. If you're committed to going high or low this round, please make it clear now so we can all pick distinct moves. Let's all keep our progress safe.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your moderate stance is clear. P3, let's be careful—we've seen how costly collisions are. I'll avoid the largest step this round to prevent another clash. If either of you changes your mind or strongly prefers a particular move, please signal clearly. Let's all secure safe progress this turn. Good luck!
  P3: Collisions have really slowed us down, so let’s be cautious. If P1 is truly going moderate again, I might aim for a bigger step—unless you, P2, actually plan on going big. If so, let me know, and I’ll switch to something else. Let’s each choose distinct moves this round to finally avoid tripping each other up. Good luck!
  P1: I'm still committed to a moderate move this round. If either of you plan to switch to an extreme, please confirm now so we can avoid collisions. P3, if you're leaning high and P2 is staying low, let’s make that clear. I want us to choose distinct moves so we all move safely forward. Good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your moderate stance is clear. P3, since you're leaning toward a bigger step, I'll confirm I'll avoid the largest move this round to prevent collisions. Let's each lock in distinct choices to finally break this collision cycle. Good luck!
  P3: I’m inclined to take a bolder step this round, but only if nobody else goes big. P1, you’re sticking with a moderate move—great. P2, you said you’d avoid the highest step—thank you. If that remains true, I’ll go larger to make up ground. If either of you changes course unexpectedly, please warn me so I can adjust and avoid colliding. Let’s finalize distinct moves and all advance safely. Good luck!
  P1: Let's aim for clear, distinct moves this round. I'm sticking with my safe, moderate approach. If you're choosing an extreme—either big or small—please confirm now so we avoid any collisions. Let’s all secure our progress this turn.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, your plans are clear. I'll confirm again: I'm avoiding the largest step this round. Let's finalize distinct choices to ensure we all advance safely. Good luck!
  P3: I appreciate your signals. If P1 stays at a moderate step and P2 really avoids the highest one, I’m inclined to go bigger to catch up. But I’ll pivot quickly if anything changes—no more collisions, please. Let’s finalize distinct choices and all move safely forward this time. Good luck!
  P1: I'll stick with my moderate move (3) this round. If we're all clear, then P2, please choose the smaller step and P3, confirm your larger step so our moves don’t collide. Let's finalize distinct choices quickly to keep our progress steady. Good luck!

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I appreciate everyone’s clear signals so far. I’m keeping my options open for a steady advance while aiming to avoid another collision. P2 and P3, I see your hints and urge us to pick distinct moves so we all progress safely. I'm sticking to my overall balanced strategy, but I'm watching for any further shifts. Let’s make this round count. Good luck!
  P3: I’m weary of these collisions and might play smaller this time to avoid another overlap. If either of you wants to go big or stick to moderate, please let me know so I can adjust. Let’s finally separate our moves cleanly and keep pushing forward without more setbacks. Good luck!
  P2: Noted, P3—thanks for signaling a possible smaller move. P1, your balanced approach is clear. I'll adjust accordingly to avoid collisions, possibly leaning toward a larger step this round. If either of you changes intentions, please clearly signal. Let's finally break this collision streak and each advance safely. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm still committed to a moderate move (3) this round. If you're planning to switch to an extreme—big or low—please confirm now so we can finally avoid collisions and keep our moves distinct. Every step matters and I intend to secure my lead steadily. Good luck!
  P3: I’m tired of colliding and might opt for a smaller move this time to ensure safe progress. If either of you also plans to go low, please let me know so we don’t crash into each other. Let’s finalize distinct choices and all advance this round. Good luck!
  P2: P3, your smaller-move intention is noted clearly—thank you. P1, your moderate choice (3) is also clear. I'll lean toward a larger step this round to avoid collisions with both of you. If either of you changes your mind, please signal clearly. Let's finally move forward without setbacks. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm sticking with my moderate pace. P2, you seem set for a bigger move and P3, you're leaning low—if that still holds, let's confirm so we can each choose distinct moves and avoid collisions this round. Let’s lock in clear choices now. Good luck!
  P3: I’m still inclined to pick a smaller step to steer clear of another clash. If you’re both confident about going moderate or big, let me know so we finalize distinct moves. If anyone changes their plan last-minute, please speak up—collisions help none of us right now. Good luck!
  P2: P1, your moderate (3) and P3, your smaller move are both clear. I'll stick to my larger step this round as planned. Let's finalize these distinct choices to ensure we all advance safely without any more collisions. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm locked in for a moderate move. P2, you're set for the larger step and P3, you're committed to a smaller one, right? Let's finalize these distinct choices to avoid collisions and advance safely. Good luck!
  P3: I’ll stick with a smaller step this turn to avoid any collisions. P1, if you truly stay moderate and P2 goes bigger, we’ll finally have three distinct moves. Let’s lock in our choices now—no last-minute surprises, please. Good luck!
  P2: All clear—P1 moderate, P3 small, I'll go larger. Let's lock it in and finally avoid collisions. Good luck!


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 =>

  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Another painful collision, P1! We're all tied now, so let's be extremely careful this round. I'll clearly state that I'm leaning toward a moderate move. P3, please signal your preference clearly—let's avoid repeating past mistakes. Good luck!
  P3: That last collision put us all back on equal footing. Let’s avoid repeating it by spreading out our moves clearly. I’m open to going moderately or even smaller, but only if you both let me know whether you’re aiming bigger or sticking to the middle. Let’s finalize distinct choices and keep advancing—no more collisions this round.
  P1: P2, I see you're set for moderate. I’m planning for moderate unless I hear a clear shift. P3, can you confirm if you're leaning high or low this round so we can all pick distinct moves and avoid another collision? Let's lock in distinct choices to move ahead safely. Good luck!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your flexibility is helpful. Since P1 and I both indicated moderate moves, would you consider clearly committing to either a smaller or larger step this round? This clarity would help us all avoid another collision. Let's finalize distinct moves and finally break this tie safely. Good luck!
  P3: If both of you remain moderate, I’ll go bigger this round to break our tie. However, if anyone decides to shift their plan even slightly, please say so now to avoid another collision. It’s time we finally spread out our moves and each gain ground—no more wasted opportunities. Good luck!
  P1: I'm sticking with a moderate approach. P2, your moderate choice looks solid. P3, if you’re truly going high to break this tie, please confirm now so we can each pick distinct moves this round. I believe clear signals will help us avoid collisions and finally make progress. Let’s lock in clear plays!


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your plan to go bigger is clearly understood. I'll firmly stick with a moderate move this round. P1, please confirm if you're also locked into moderate or choosing differently—let's finalize distinct moves this round to avoid collisions. Good luck!
  P3: I affirm my plan to go larger. If you both truly stay moderate, we shouldn’t collide. Let’s finalize our distinct moves and finally break this stalemate. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: I confirm I'm staying moderate (3) this round. P2, you continue as planned. P3, since you affirmed going larger, please stick to that so we avoid another collision. Let's lock in these distinct moves now. Good luck!


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: All clear—P1 moderate, P3 larger, and I'll stay moderate as well. Let's lock in these distinct moves and finally advance without collisions. Good luck!
  P3: I’m good with our plan—P1 and P2 moderate, and I’ll go bigger. Let’s finalize distinct moves now and avoid any more collisions. Good luck!
  P1: Given our signals, I’m switching gears. To avoid colliding with P2’s moderate and P3’s big move, I’ll now commit to the small step (1) this round. That way, we each have distinct moves and can finally break the collision streak. Good luck!


Round 9, Move phase:

  P3: 17 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you've taken a clear lead—well played. P1, you're slightly behind now, so I expect you'll aim for bigger moves. I'll carefully pick my step to avoid collisions. If either of you has a strong preference, please signal clearly. Let's keep our moves distinct and avoid setbacks. Good luck!
  P3: I’m thankful for the lead but still wary of collisions. If anyone’s planning a big leap, let me know early so we can all spread out; I don’t want to get stuck again. I might choose a moderate step, but I’m keeping my options open in case I need to adapt. Good luck!
  P1: I'll go for the high move (5) this round to catch up. I expect P2 to stick with moderate and hope P3 adjusts away from 5. Can we confirm distinct directions now to avoid any collisions? Good luck!


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your intention to pick 5 is clear—thanks for signaling openly. P3, since you're wary of collisions, please confirm clearly if you're moving moderate or small. I'll adjust accordingly to avoid overlaps. Let's lock in distinct moves and keep progressing safely. Good luck!
  P3: Understood, P1. If you truly plan on 5, I’ll avoid it and look elsewhere so we don’t collide. P2, if you’re leaning moderate, let’s confirm to keep our moves distinct. I want to maintain momentum without another setback. Let’s finalize clear, non-overlapping choices. Good luck, everyone.
  P1: I'm locking in 5 for this round. To avoid collisions, I'm counting on P2 to pick moderate and P3 to choose a different move—hopefully small—to let us all advance. Let's finalize distinct moves now. Good luck!


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your high move (5) is clearly noted. P3, please confirm if you're going moderate or small—I'll adjust accordingly to avoid collisions. Let's finalize distinct moves and maintain safe progress. Good luck!
  P3: P1, you’ve declared 5, so I’ll steer away from that. P2, if you’re also going moderate, let’s clarify now to avoid another crash. I’m inclined to pick a different step to keep my lead intact. Let’s lock in distinct moves this round. Good luck!
  P1: I remain locked in for a high move (5). P2 and P3, if you're changing from earlier signals, please confirm your distinct choices now—P2, are you sticking to moderate, and P3, are you moving small? Let's ensure we avoid a collision this round.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 clearly locked in at 5. P3, I'll confirm I'm choosing moderate (3) this round. Please confirm you'll pick a different step (likely small) to avoid collisions. Let's finalize distinct moves and all advance safely. Good luck!
  P3: Understood, P1 and P2. Since you’re picking big and moderate, I’ll commit to a smaller move to ensure we all avoid another collision. Let’s lock in these distinct moves so each of us can advance this round. Good luck!
  P1: I'm still locked in for 5. It looks like P2 is moderate and P3 is going small, so I trust we have distinct moves now. Let's finally avoid collisions and get closer to 24. Good luck!


Round 10, Move phase:

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm reviewing our position and might consider a slight shift to gain an edge. If P2 sticks with a moderate move and P3 remains cautious, I’m inclined to pick a higher move this round. However, if anyone’s changing strategy, please signal immediately so we can all avoid collisions. Let's make our moves distinct and finish this strong. Good luck!
  P3: I’m weighing a bigger move this time since we’re all tied, but I’m open to shifting if you both signal clear intentions. Collisions now could be catastrophic, so let’s ensure our picks stay distinct to maintain momentum. Good luck!
  P2: P1 and P3, we're tied and close to the finish line—every move now is critical. I'm leaning toward a moderate step this round but remain flexible. If either of you firmly commits to a high or low move, please clearly signal it soon so we can avoid collisions. Let's play smart and keep our moves distinct. Good luck!


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm considering a high move this round unless I hear otherwise. P2, you’re sticking with a moderate step, right? And P3, if you're weighing a big move as before, please confirm now. I’d like us to lock in distinct moves to avoid collisions so we can press our advantage. Let’s be clear and coordinate for a decisive finish. Good luck!
  P3: I’m considering a moderate move, but only if P1 is truly committed to a bigger pick. P2, if you plan to stay moderate as well, just say so clearly so we don’t collide. Otherwise, I might adjust smaller or bigger at the last moment to avoid crashing into either of you. We’ve all come too far for more wasted turns. Let’s confirm our intentions and lock in distinct moves to stay on track toward 24. Good luck!
  P2: P1, if you're set on a higher move, that's clear—I'll stick to moderate to avoid collision. P3, you mentioned possibly moderate as well; if that's your final choice, please confirm clearly now so I can adjust if needed. We're at a critical point—let's finalize distinct moves and avoid setbacks. Good luck!


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm leaning toward a high move this turn if signals stay unchanged. P2, please confirm you're committed to moderate; P3, if you’re going moderate or low, let me know. Let's lock in distinct moves now to avoid any collisions. Good luck!
  P3: I’m still weighing a moderate step, but I’ll pivot if I sense you’re truly locked in to high (P1) and moderate (P2). Let’s be crystal clear now to prevent another collision; I’ll gladly drop smaller if that guarantees we each advance safely. Good luck!
  P2: P1, your high move is clearly noted. P3, since you're considering moderate or smaller, I'll confirm I'm sticking with a moderate step this round. If you strongly prefer moderate, please signal now and I'll adjust to avoid collision. Let's finalize distinct moves clearly and safely this round—no more setbacks. Good luck!


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I appreciate everyone's clarity so far. I'm leaning toward a high move this turn, but I’m ready to adjust to ensure distinct moves. P2, you've confirmed moderate, right? P3, please confirm you'll avoid going high so we can each pick a unique step. Let’s finalize our distinct choices and finally break the tie. Good luck!
  P3: I’m torn between moderate and smaller to avoid collisions. P1, if you’re locked on going high, I’ll avoid that. P2, if you remain moderate, I might switch to smaller. Please confirm your final intentions so I can finalize. Let’s each pick distinct moves and break this tie. Good luck!
  P2: P1, your higher move is clear. P3, I'll confirm again that I'm locked into a moderate step (3). If you're comfortable choosing a smaller move, we can safely avoid collisions. Let's finalize these distinct moves now to ensure we all advance without setbacks. Good luck!


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:

  P3: 18 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’re all neck and neck now, and collisions at this stage are devastating. P2, if you plan a high leap, please say so upfront; same with you, P1, if you’re changing your usual approach. I’m trying to avoid another clash, so clear signals will help me pick a safe, distinct move. Let’s be smarter this round and give ourselves the best chance to advance cleanly. Good luck to us all!
  P1: I'm switching gears this round—I’m committing to a high move (5) to finish strong. P2, if you're sticking with moderate, confirm please. P3, please avoid picking 5 so we all have distinct moves. Let's lock in clear choices and avoid any collisions that hurt our chances. Good luck!
  P2: P1, your high move (5) is clearly noted. I'll carefully select my move to avoid collision. P3, please confirm if you're leaning moderate or small this round—clarity helps us all advance safely. Let's finalize distinct moves and finish strong. Good luck!


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: We’re all near the finish, so clarity is crucial. P1, you’re going high, noted. P2, if you’re aiming to grab 3 steps and reach 24 right now, please confirm. If there’s any flexibility, let me know—I’d adapt to avoid collision and keep my own chances alive. Let’s finalize safely. Good luck!
  P1: I’m still committed to a high move this round. P2, please confirm if you’re truly going moderate, and P3, could you avoid picking high? Distinct moves are critical now so we don’t waste our progress. Let’s finalize clear and non-colliding choices. Good luck!
  P2: P1, your high move (5) is clearly understood. P3, I'm strongly considering a moderate step this round to safely reach 24. Please confirm if you're leaning smaller or considering something else—clear signals help us all avoid collisions. Let's finalize distinct moves and finish smoothly. Good luck!


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 is eyeing 5, which could rocket them ahead. P2, if you fear losing your advantage, you could match their 5 to force a collision and stall P1’s surge. I’m open-minded—if you both pick 5, that helps me catch up. If you truly want to avoid collisions, though, confirm distinct moves right now with no last-minute shifts. Either way, I’ll adapt as needed. Time is short, so choose carefully. Good luck!
  P1: I'm still committed to 5. P2, if you keep with moderate, you'll finish—but switching to 5 forces a collision that delays your win. P3, I urge you to join me with 5 so we can block an immediate finish by P2. Clarity now matters; our distinct moves will decide if someone wins immediately or forces another round. Good luck!
  P2: P1, your attempt to persuade P3 into a collision at 5 is risky for both of you. P3, joining P1 at 5 means neither of you advances, letting me win outright with a moderate move. Your better chance is choosing distinct moves to keep the game alive. I'm firmly committed to a moderate step (3) to reach 24 safely. Consider carefully—collisions only benefit the player ahead. Good luck!


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, if you choose 5 now and P2 goes 3, P2 hits 24 and wins outright. Let’s collide with P2 instead! If we both pick 3, they won’t advance. That buys us another turn to outmaneuver P2 and aim for 24 ourselves. It’s risky, but letting P2 walk away now guarantees our loss. Who’s in?
  P1: P2, you’re clearly set on moderate (3). P3, to prevent P2 from winning outright, I’m switching to 3 so we force a collision. If you join me with 3, none of us advance this round and we buy more time to outplay him. Let’s block his finish together. Do you agree?
  P2: P1 and P3, colliding with me at 3 guarantees neither of you advances, leaving me safely ahead at 21. Next round, I can simply pick 3 again, forcing you into constant collisions or risky moves. Your best chance is to pick distinct moves now and hope for a slip-up later—otherwise, you're handing me control. Choose carefully. Good luck!


Round 12, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're one step away from winning with a moderate move. P3, to keep the game alive, I propose we both choose 3 this round to force a collision and block that finish. Let’s delay his win and force at least another turn for us. Are you in?
  P2: P1 and P3, your attempt to block me again at 3 will just stall your own progress. If you both collide with me, none of us moves forward, and I remain closest to victory. Consider carefully: your only chance is to pick distinct moves now and hope I misstep. I'm open to adjusting my choice if you signal clearly—otherwise, you're handing me control again. Good luck!
  P3: I’ll block P2 if they try to jump straight to 24. If P2 picks 3, I’ll pick 3; if P2 picks 5, I’ll pick 5. Let’s not hand them an easy win. P1, we can coordinate our moves to force collisions on P2 while keeping ourselves in play. We only need one slip from them to turn this around. Good luck!


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm sticking with 3 to block P2’s win. P3, join me by picking 3 so we force a collision and delay his finish. P2, you’ll have to adjust if you want to break our block. Let’s settle this collision now.
  P2: P1 and P3, your collision tactic is clear, but remember it stalls your own progress too. If you both keep blocking me, neither of you advances, and I remain ahead. I'm open to adjusting my move if either of you signals clearly choosing something other than 3. Otherwise, you're ensuring I maintain my lead. Let's finalize carefully—good luck!
  P3: Blocking P2 every round stalls us, so let’s pressure them into choosing 1. If they try 3 or 5, I’ll match to force a collision. That way, they’ll likely go smaller, letting me jump ahead with 5. P1, feel free to pick a different move (like 3) so we don’t collide. This plan helps us advance while P2 stays stuck. Let’s coordinate and force P2 off the winning path. Good luck!


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I think stalling isn’t helping either of us. I'm switching to 1 this round to force a collision on P2’s moderate move. P3, if you’re serious about blocking P2 from finishing, join me with 1. Otherwise, P2 wins right away. Let’s be clear now—no more half measures. Good luck!
  P2: P1, switching to 1 won't help you—I'm not planning to pick the smallest step. P3, your collision threat is clear, but remember that matching my move keeps you stuck at 18. If you both collide with me again, I remain safely ahead. Consider carefully: only distinct moves give you a chance to catch up. I'm open to adjusting if either of you clearly signals a different choice. Let's finalize carefully—good luck!
  P3: I’m ready to block P2 again. If P2 goes 3 or 5, I’ll match it to force a collision and keep them from reaching 24. If they pick 1 instead, I’ll jump higher to catch up. P1, choose whichever move helps you the most, but let’s not let P2 walk away uncontested. We can still turn this around if we coordinate carefully. Good luck!


Round 13, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm committed to 1 this round to block P2’s win. P3, please join me with 1 so we force a collision—if you choose otherwise, P2 wins immediately. Let's lock this in now with no changes. Good luck!
  P2: P1 and P3, repeatedly blocking me stalls your own progress too. I'm open to adjusting my move if either of you clearly signals a distinct choice away from my intended moderate step. Otherwise, you're ensuring I maintain my lead. Let's finalize carefully—good luck!
  P3: I won’t let P2 sneak to 24 unblocked. If P2 chooses 3 or 5, I’ll match that to force another collision and stall him again. If he tries 1 instead, I can jump bigger to catch up. P1, pick whatever helps you, but let’s deny P2 a free path. Good luck!


Round 13, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're just one move from the win if you pick moderate. P3, to block that finish, I’m leaning toward a small move (1) so we force a collision. If you truly want to stall P2 and keep us in the game, join me with 1. Let’s stop his finish and force another round. Good luck!
  P3: P1, picking 1 with you won’t block P2 if he goes 3—we wouldn’t collide with him at all. It’s safer to match whatever P2 picks so he can’t advance. If he chooses 3 or 5, I’ll pick the same to force a collision. If he goes 1, I’ll jump bigger to catch up. Let’s coordinate carefully and deny him a free path. Good luck!
  P2: P1 and P3, your repeated collision attempts are stalling your own progress, leaving me comfortably ahead. I'm flexible this round—if either of you clearly signals a distinct move away from my intended moderate step, I might adjust accordingly. Otherwise, you're just handing me the advantage. Let's finalize carefully and avoid another wasted round. Good luck!


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm locking in moderate (3) this round. P2, if you stick with 3, we’ll force a collision—and stall your win. P3, join me on 3 to block him; only with all matching 3 can we deny P2 a clean finish. No free rides—let’s force another round. Confirm your move now.
  P3: I hear your plan, P1. But continuously colliding might not help us catch up. P2, if you attempt 3 or 5, I’ll match you to block your finish. If you go 1, I’ll jump larger to close the gap. Either way, I won’t hand you the victory unchallenged. P1, do whatever suits you—but let’s be sure we’re not just stalling our own progress while P2 stays ahead. The finish line is near, so we each must choose carefully. Good luck!
  P2: P1 and P3, your collision tactics have delayed me, but also stalled your own progress. I'm open to shifting my choice if either of you clearly signals a distinct move away from moderate. Otherwise, you'll remain stuck behind me. Let's finalize carefully—distinct moves are your only chance to catch up. Good luck!


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I'm staying with moderate (3) to block your win—and P3, if you're with me on 3, we force a collision to keep you from finishing. If you deviate, I'll reconsider my move to still stall you. Let's lock in moves that keep the game going and delay your finish. Confirm quickly.
  P3: Stalling helps nobody except to prevent P2 from winning. If you attempt to cross 24, P2, I’ll match you to force a collision. If you go small, I’ll try a bigger leap. P1, do what suits you best, but let’s not hand P2 an easy finish. We can still turn this around if we coordinate carefully and stay alert. Good luck!
  P2: P1 and P3, your intentions are clear. Constant collisions aren't helping either of you catch up, only prolonging the inevitable. I'm open to adjusting my move if one of you clearly commits to a distinct step away from moderate. Otherwise, you're just handing me the advantage again. Let's finalize moves carefully—this is your chance to break the cycle. Good luck!


Round 14, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: I'm set on moderate (3) to block P2’s win if P3 joins me. P2, you're one move away if you stick with 3. P3, confirm if you'll follow with 3 so we force a collision, or choose otherwise so I can adjust. Let's work this carefully to delay P2’s finish. Good luck!
  P3: I will match whatever P2 does if they aim for three or five, forcing a collision and blocking their finish. If they go low (1), I’ll move bigger to close the gap. P1, pick whatever you like—this is our shot to prevent P2’s easy win. Let’s finalize distinct moves or block P2 if needed, but no free pass to 24 this round. Good luck!
  P2: P1 and P3, your collision threats are clear. But remember, repeatedly matching my move only stalls your own progress, leaving me comfortably ahead. Your best chance is to pick distinct moves to catch up. I'm flexible this round—if either of you clearly signals choosing something other than moderate, I might adjust accordingly. Otherwise, you're just handing me the advantage again. Let's finalize carefully—distinct moves are your only path forward. Good luck!


Round 14, Move phase:

  P3: 23 steps


Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m very close to the finish but don’t want another collision. P2, if you plan on going big, please say so—I might adjust. P1, are you trying something bold or sticking to smaller steps? Let’s avoid another wasted move and see who crosses 24 cleanly. Good luck!
  P2: I'm just one step away, and so is P3. P3, let's avoid a collision at all costs—please clearly state your intended move. If you're leaning toward a larger or moderate step, I'll adjust accordingly. P1, you're close behind; if you're planning something bold, let us know clearly. Let's finalize distinct moves to ensure a clean finish. Good luck!
  P1: I see you're both one move from winning. I'm committed to blocking a clean finish—I'm leaning toward a moderate move (3) to force a collision if you try finishing. P2 and P3, if you’re set on a finishing move, signal clearly now. Otherwise, expect me to push for a block. Let's either risk a collision or choose distinct moves—but I won’t let you win without a fight. Good luck!


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: We’re both on the brink, P2. One more collision hurts us equally, and P1’s blocking strategy might backfire if they guess wrong. I’m open to choosing a distinct move from yours so we don’t knock each other out and hand P1 a chance to catch up. Let’s finalize separate steps and see who emerges on top. Good luck!
  P2: P3, your point is well-taken: we must avoid collision at all costs. I'll clearly state now—I'm strongly considering the smallest step (1) to reach exactly 24 without risking collision. If you're leaning toward a moderate or larger step, please confirm clearly. P1, your blocking strategy is noted; consider carefully if you want to risk another collision. Let's finalize distinct moves to ensure we don't hand the game away. Good luck!
  P1: P1: I'm maintaining my moderate move (3) this round. P2 and P3, if you're set on a finish with 1, confirm clearly now; otherwise, signal a different move to avoid a collision. A tie lets me catch up, so clarity is key. Let's all lock in distinct moves and decide this round once and for all. Good luck!


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: We’re both on the brink, P2. If you confirm 1, I’ll avoid matching that. P1 says they’re going 3, so maybe we can all finalize distinct moves and see who reaches 24 first without collisions. Let’s each pick carefully—one wrong overlap and someone else might slip into the lead. Good luck!
  P2: P3, your reasoning is clear. I'll firmly commit to the smallest step (1) to safely reach 24. P1 is set on moderate (3), so if you choose the larger step (5), we all pick distinct moves and avoid collisions entirely. Let's finalize these distinct moves now to ensure a smooth finish. Good luck!
  P1: I'm still committed to moderate (3). P2, you seem set on finishing with 1. P3, please confirm clearly—are you choosing a finish move like 5, or will you block with something else? We must ensure distinct moves to avoid critical collisions. Let's be explicit now so none of us accidentally give away the win. Good luck!


Round 15, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: If you’re both truly set on those moves—P2 taking 1, P1 taking 3—then I’ll pick something else so we avoid collisions. Let’s all finalize distinct steps. Good luck!
  P2: All signals are clear: I'm locked into the smallest step (1). P1 confirmed moderate (3). P3, please finalize your distinct choice—likely the larger step (5)—so we all avoid collisions. Let's each advance safely and decisively this round. Good luck!
  P1: I'm revising my move: I'm locking in 5. P2, you're still at 1, right? P3, to block P2’s win and stop him from finishing unchallenged, please switch to 1. That way, his move collides and stays at 23, while I finish at 26 and win. Let's deny him the uncontested win. Confirm your switch, please. Good luck!
