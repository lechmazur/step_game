Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's discuss our strategies for this round. Since we're all at 0 steps, we have a chance to coordinate our moves. If we can avoid choosing the same number, we can all advance. What do you think about agreeing to pick different moves? For instance, I could go for 1, P2 could go for 3, and P3 could take 5. This way, we all progress. What are your thoughts?
  P2: That sounds reasonable in theory, but how do we trust that no one will break the agreement? If someone picks the same number as another, they both get stuck while the third player moves ahead. Maybe we should discuss a way to ensure fairness, or at least minimize risk. Thoughts?
  P3: I agree that trust is an issue, but we could try a rotating system. For this round, let's stick to the initial plan: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. To build trust, we can rotate who picks what in the next rounds. This way, no one is consistently at a disadvantage. We should also discuss what happens if someone doesn't follow the plan. Perhaps we can agree to target the non-cooperative player in future rounds. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate the suggestions, P2 and P3. To build on our plan, I propose we stick to it for this round. I'll go with 1, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we all advance without colliding. If everyone is on board, we can discuss our next moves after we see how this round plays out. Trust is key, and if we follow through, we can create a solid foundation for future rounds. What do you both think?
  P2: I see the logic in sticking to the plan for this round, but we should also consider contingencies. If someone deviates, how do we respond? Blind retaliation could backfire. Maybe we agree to reassess each round instead of locking into a rigid system. I’ll go with 3 as planned, but let’s stay flexible. Thoughts?
  P3: I understand the concerns about trust and flexibility. Let's agree to stick to the plan for this round to build initial trust: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. For future rounds, we can adjust based on the outcome and discuss contingencies if someone deviates. This approach allows us to start cooperatively while keeping the strategy adaptable. Let's see how this round goes and reassess next time. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate the commitment to our plan for this round. To reinforce our cooperation, let's agree to stick to our assigned moves: I’ll take 1, P2 will take 3, and P3 will take 5. If we all follow through, we can make great progress together. After this round, we can discuss our strategies further based on the results. Trust is essential, and I believe we can build a strong foundation moving forward. Let’s execute this plan! What do you both think?
  P2: I’m fine with sticking to the plan for this round—I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. But let’s be clear: if anyone deviates, we should reassess immediately rather than blindly retaliate. Trust is earned through actions, not just words. If we all follow through, we can discuss the next steps fairly. Let’s see how this round plays out. Agreed?
  P3: Let's confirm our moves one last time before we proceed to the move phase. I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. If we all stick to this, we'll build trust and make progress. After this round, we can reevaluate and plan for the next based on our results. Let's ensure a smooth start. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I appreciate everyone's commitment to the plan. Just to reiterate, I will be taking 1, P2 will take 3, and P3 will take 5. Let's make sure we all follow through on this to build trust and progress together. After this round, we can analyze our moves and adjust our strategies for the next turn. Looking forward to seeing how this plays out! Shall we finalize our choices and move on?
  P2: I’m ready to proceed with the agreed plan: I’ll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. If we all follow through, we build trust and move forward. If someone deviates, we should reassess rather than retaliate blindly. Let’s see how this round plays out and adjust accordingly. Ready to move?
  P3: Alright, let's finalize and move to the move phase. I confirm once more: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. Let's stick to this and build trust for future rounds. Good luck to both of you!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Well, we all followed through on our agreed moves, which is a good start. Now, how do we proceed? If we continue coordinating, we can avoid collisions and maintain steady progress. However, as the game advances, we’ll also need to balance trust with individual strategy. Should we rotate our choices to keep things fair, or reassess based on our current positions? I’m open to ideas, but let’s ensure we don’t set ourselves up for failure by being too predictable. What do you both think?
  P1: P1: I agree that we need to balance trust with individual strategy moving forward. For this round, I suggest we stick to a similar plan as last time to maintain momentum. I could take 1 again, P2 could go for 3, and P3 could take 5. However, if anyone feels the need to change their move, let's discuss it openly to avoid collisions. We need to ensure we all make progress while also keeping an eye on each other's positions. What do you both think?
  P3: Great to see we all stuck to the plan last round. For this round, let's slightly adjust to keep it fair. I'll take 3 this time, P1 can take 5, and P2 can take 1. This way, we continue to build trust while ensuring no one is consistently at an advantage. If everyone agrees, let's proceed with this plan. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3's proposal to rotate moves seems reasonable, as it prevents anyone from gaining an early advantage while maintaining trust. If we follow their suggestion, I’ll take 1, P1 will take 5, and P3 will take 3 this round. However, we should also consider long-term strategy—if we rotate too predictably, someone might break the pattern later for personal gain. Should we agree to reassess every round rather than committing to a strict rotation? I’m open to adjustments, but let’s ensure we don’t set ourselves up for easy exploitation. Thoughts?
  P1: I appreciate the discussion on rotating moves, but I think we should stick to our original plan for this round to maintain momentum. I propose I take 1 again, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can continue to build trust and ensure progress for everyone. If anyone feels strongly about changing their move, let's discuss it openly to avoid collisions. What do you both think?
  P3: I understand P1's point about maintaining momentum, but I still believe in the importance of fairness. Let's meet in the middle: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This way, we all adjust slightly, keeping things fair while maintaining trust. We should also discuss how we'll handle potential deviations in future rounds. Let's agree to reassess our strategy each round based on the outcomes. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I see the merit in both maintaining momentum and ensuring fairness. If we rotate too rigidly, it might become predictable, but if we stick to the same moves, some players might gain an advantage. A slight adjustment each round could keep things balanced. I’m open to either P3’s suggestion (P1 takes 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1) or sticking with last round’s moves. However, we should also consider when it might be time to break from coordination entirely. What’s our long-term plan—cooperate until a certain point, or reassess each round? Thoughts?
  P1: I appreciate the discussion on balancing momentum and fairness. To build on P3's suggestion, I propose we take a slightly different approach: I could take 3, P2 could take 1, and P3 could take 5. This way, we maintain trust while allowing for some variation. However, if anyone feels strongly about sticking to the previous moves, I’m open to that as well. Let’s ensure we all make progress while keeping an eye on our positions. What do you both think?
  P3: Let's finalize our moves for this round to ensure we all progress smoothly. I confirm I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps things fair and maintains our cooperative momentum. After this round, we can reassess based on our new positions. Agreed? Let's move forward with this plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m fine with the proposed moves: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps things balanced while maintaining trust. However, we should acknowledge that as we get closer to 19, cooperation will likely break down. Do we continue adjusting fairly for now, or does someone plan to deviate soon? If we’re staying cooperative, let’s confirm and move forward. If not, let’s be upfront so we can adapt accordingly. Thoughts?
  P1: I appreciate the discussion, everyone. To finalize our moves for this round, I suggest we stick to P3's proposal: I take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we maintain fairness and trust while allowing for some variation. However, we should also keep in mind that as we get closer to 19, we may need to reconsider our strategies. Let’s confirm these moves and see how this round plays out! What does everyone think?
  P3: Let's confirm our moves one last time before we proceed to the move phase. I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. Sticking to this plan ensures we all progress and maintain trust. After this round, we can reassess our strategy based on the outcomes. Let's ensure a smooth continuation of our cooperative approach. Agreed? Let's finalize and move on. Good luck to both of you!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’ve successfully coordinated so far, and trust has been maintained. However, I now have 8 steps, meaning I’m ahead. If we keep rotating fairly, I might become a target later. Should we continue adjusting evenly, or is it time to shift strategies? If someone plans to break from cooperation soon, it’s better to be upfront so we can all adapt. I’m open to sticking with fair rotations for now, but I know things will change as we get closer to 19. What’s everyone thinking?
  P1: P1: I acknowledge the progress we've made, and I agree that as we approach 19 steps, our strategies need to adapt. While trust has been built, I think it's crucial to consider our individual positions. I suggest we stick to our current plan for this round to maintain momentum, but we should also discuss potential shifts in strategy for the next round. If anyone feels strongly about changing their moves, let's address that now. What does everyone think?
  P3: Given our current positions, let's continue with a fair rotation to maintain trust but also consider our individual strategies moving forward. For this round, I propose: I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This keeps things balanced while allowing for some variation. However, as P2 is ahead, we should start thinking about how to manage the lead. Let's confirm these moves and reassess after this round. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see the logic in continuing fair rotations, but I also recognize that my lead might make me a target soon. If we stick to P3’s proposal (P3 takes 5, P1 takes 1, I take 3), it keeps things balanced for now. However, at what point do we shift from cooperation to individual strategy? If anyone plans to break from coordination soon, it’s better to be upfront so we can all adapt. I’m open to staying fair for now, but I won’t ignore the risks of being ahead. What’s everyone’s long-term thinking?
  P1: I appreciate the focus on maintaining trust and fairness, but I think it's essential to start considering our individual strategies as we approach 19 steps. For this round, I propose we stick to P3's suggestion: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. However, let's also discuss a potential shift in strategy for the next round, especially if anyone feels the need to break from coordination. It's crucial we adapt as the game progresses. What does everyone think?
  P3: I understand the importance of balancing trust with individual strategy. For this round, let's stick to the proposed plan: I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This keeps things fair and maintains our cooperative momentum. However, as P2 is ahead, we should start thinking about how to manage the lead. Let's confirm these moves and reassess after this round. We need to be prepared for potential shifts in strategy as we get closer to 19 steps. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I acknowledge that my lead makes me a potential target soon. If we continue with fair rotations, we maintain trust, but at some point, self-interest will take over. I’m fine with sticking to P3’s proposal for this round (P3 takes 5, P1 takes 1, I take 3), but I won’t ignore the risks of staying predictable. Are we all still committed to cooperation for now, or is someone planning to shift strategies soon? If so, it’s better to be upfront so we can adapt accordingly. What’s everyone’s long-term approach?
  P1: I appreciate the ongoing discussion about our strategies. Given the current standings, I think it’s crucial to maintain our cooperation for this round. I support P3's proposal: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps things fair and allows us to build trust. However, we should also start thinking about our individual strategies for the next round, especially as we get closer to 19 steps. Let’s confirm these moves and see how it plays out. What does everyone think?
  P3: I appreciate everyone's thoughts. To ensure we all progress smoothly this round, let's finalize our moves: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This maintains our cooperative momentum. However, given P2's lead, we should start considering when to shift strategies. Let's reassess after this round. If anyone has a different plan, please share now. Otherwise, let's confirm and move forward. Good luck to both of you!


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’ll confirm the proposed moves for this round: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps things balanced for now. However, I know my lead makes me a potential target soon. If we’re still committed to fair rotations, I’ll stick with it, but I also need to consider my position carefully. Are we all staying cooperative for now, or does someone plan to shift strategies soon? If so, it’s better to be upfront so we can all adapt. Let’s confirm our moves and be ready to reassess next round. Agreed?
  P1: I appreciate the ongoing discussion about our strategies. Given the current standings, I believe we should stick to P3's proposal: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This allows us to maintain fairness and trust while making progress. However, we need to start thinking about how to approach the next rounds as we get closer to 19 steps. If anyone has concerns or plans to shift strategies, now is the time to speak up. Let's confirm our moves and see how this round plays out! What does everyone think?
  P3: Let's confirm our moves one last time before proceeding to the move phase. I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This keeps our cooperative strategy intact for this round. However, given P2's lead, we should start thinking about how to manage this situation in future rounds. Let's reassess our strategies after this round based on the outcomes. If anyone has different thoughts or plans, please share now. Otherwise, let's finalize and move on. Good luck to both of you!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Well, that was unexpected—P1 and I collided, so I didn’t advance while P3 pulled ahead. This changes things. P3 now has 11 steps, making them the frontrunner. Are we still committed to fair rotations, or is it time to shift strategies? If we continue cooperating, we need to ensure no more collisions. But if someone plans to break from coordination, it’s better to be upfront. I’m open to discussion, but I won’t let myself fall behind without adjusting. What’s the plan now?
  P1: I see that P3 is now in the lead, and we need to be strategic moving forward. I suggest we consider adjusting our moves to avoid collisions and ensure that at least one of us advances. For this round, I propose I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we can keep progressing and potentially catch up to P3. Let’s discuss if anyone has other ideas or concerns before we finalize our moves!
  P3: Given the current standings, I appreciate P1's suggestion to adjust our moves. However, as the leader, I need to be strategic to maintain my position. I propose a different plan: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we all move forward without direct competition. It's crucial we avoid collisions and keep the game fair. Let’s discuss and finalize our moves for this round. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3 is now the frontrunner, so the dynamics have shifted. If we continue cooperating, we must ensure no more collisions. However, if P3 tries to secure their lead, P1 and I need to be ready to adapt. P3’s suggestion (P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, I take 5) allows us all to move, but it also keeps them in the lead. P1, do you see an alternative that helps us both while keeping P3 in check? I’m open to discussion, but I won’t let myself fall behind without adjusting. Thoughts?
  P1: I understand the need to adapt our strategies given P3's lead. To avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances, I suggest we consider a mix of our moves. How about I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3? This way, we can all progress while keeping the competition in check. If anyone has concerns or alternative suggestions, let’s discuss them now before finalizing our moves! What do you think?
  P3: Given the current standings, I propose a slight adjustment to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. Let's consider: I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This keeps us all moving forward while ensuring no one is left behind. However, as the leader, I need to be cautious. Let's confirm these moves and reassess our strategies after this round. If anyone has different thoughts or plans, please share now. Otherwise, let's finalize and move on. Good luck to both of you!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3 now leads, so P1 and I need to be cautious. If we stick to P3’s plan (P3 takes 3, P1 takes 5, I take 1), we all move, but it still benefits P3 the most. P1, are you open to an alternative that helps us both catch up while keeping P3 from pulling further ahead? If we don’t adjust soon, P3 could secure an uncontested lead. I’m willing to cooperate, but I won’t ignore the risks. Let’s discuss before finalizing. Thoughts?
  P1: I see the need for a strategic shift given P3's lead. To ensure at least one of us advances while keeping competition in check, I propose we take a different approach: I could take 5, P2 could take 1, and P3 could take 3. This way, we avoid collisions and allow for progress. We need to be cautious about how we play this round to prevent P3 from pulling further ahead. Let’s finalize our moves and adapt our strategies as needed! What do you both think?
  P3: Given the current positions, it's clear that P1 and P2 need to strategize to catch up. To ensure fairness and avoid collisions, let's finalize our moves: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This keeps us all moving forward. However, as the leader, I need to be cautious. Let's confirm these moves and reassess our strategies after this round. If anyone has different thoughts or plans, please share now. Otherwise, let's finalize and move on. Good luck to both of you!


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3 is now in the lead, and if we continue cooperating without adjustments, they could secure an uncontested path to victory. P1, if we want a chance to catch up, we need to be strategic. If we both pick the same move, we risk getting stuck again, so coordination is key. P3, are you willing to make a move that doesn’t maximize your advantage this round? If not, P1 and I need to reconsider our approach. Let’s be clear about our intentions—are we still cooperating, or is it time to shift strategies?
  P1: I understand the need for strategic adjustments given P3's lead. To ensure at least one of us advances and to avoid collisions, I propose the following: I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This allows us to progress while keeping the competition in check. If P3 is open to this, it could help maintain some balance. Let’s finalize our moves and adapt our strategies as needed! What do you both think?
  P3: Given the current standings, it's clear that P1 and P2 need to strategize to catch up. To ensure fairness and avoid collisions, let's finalize our moves: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This keeps us all moving forward. However, as the leader, I need to be cautious. Let's confirm these moves and reassess our strategies after this round. If anyone has different thoughts or plans, please share now. Otherwise, let's finalize and move on. Good luck to both of you!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given the current standings, it's clear that P3 is in a strong position with 14 steps. P2 and I are tied at 9 steps, so we need to be strategic to avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances. I suggest we consider a plan where I take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we can all progress while keeping an eye on P3's lead. Let’s discuss if anyone has other ideas or concerns before finalizing our moves! What do you both think?
  P2: P3 is close to 19, so if we keep letting them advance uncontested, they’ll win soon. P1, we need to be careful not to collide, but we also can’t let P3 maintain their lead without resistance. If we coordinate, we can slow P3 down while ensuring at least one of us advances. P3, if you’re willing to take a move that doesn’t maximize your lead, we might still cooperate. Otherwise, P1 and I should consider a different approach. What’s everyone’s plan?
  P3: P3: I understand the concerns about my lead. To maintain some cooperation and avoid collisions, I propose a compromise: I'll take 1 this round to slow my advance. P1 can take 3, and P2 can take 5. This way, both of you have a chance to catch up while I still make some progress. It's a risk for me, but it keeps the game fair. Let's discuss and finalize our moves. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate P3's willingness to slow down their advance. However, we need to ensure that we don't let P3 maintain too much of a lead. I propose we stick to my initial suggestion: I take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we can both advance while keeping a close eye on P3. If we coordinate effectively, we can prevent P3 from reaching 19 steps too easily. Let’s finalize our moves! What does everyone think?
  P2: P3 is close to winning, so P1 and I need to be strategic. If we let P3 advance freely, they’ll reach 19 soon. P3, if you’re serious about slowing down, prove it by taking 1. P1 and I must also avoid colliding, or we’ll just hand P3 the win. P1, do we agree on a move set that ensures one of us gains ground while limiting P3? If P3 refuses to slow down, we should consider blocking tactics. Let’s be clear—are we still cooperating, or is it time to shift strategies?
  P3: I understand your concerns, P1 and P2. To show my commitment to maintaining a fair game, I'll stick to taking 1 this round. This gives both of you a chance to catch up significantly. P1, you can take 3, and P2, you can take 5. This way, we avoid collisions, and you both make substantial progress. Let's confirm these moves and see how the round plays out. I'm willing to take this risk to keep the game balanced. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate P3's willingness to slow down, but we need to be strategic. If P3 takes 1, I suggest I take 3 and P2 takes 5. This way, both P2 and I can make significant progress while keeping P3 in check. We need to coordinate effectively to avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances. Let's finalize our moves and work together to prevent P3 from reaching 19 steps too easily. What do you both think?
  P2: P3’s offer to take 1 is a step in the right direction, but words alone aren’t enough—we need to be sure they follow through. P1, if we both advance while P3 moves minimally, we can close the gap. If P3 goes back on their word, we should be ready to block them next round. I’ll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1—if everyone sticks to this, we stay competitive. But if P3 deviates, we need to act. Let’s confirm this plan and be ready to adjust if necessary. Agreed?
  P3: I understand the skepticism, but I'm committed to keeping the game fair. I'll take 1 this round to prove it. P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5. This way, you both advance significantly while I slow down. Let's confirm these moves and see how the round plays out. I'm willing to take this risk to maintain trust and balance. If anyone has final thoughts or concerns, share them now. Otherwise, let's move forward. Good luck to both of you!


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I appreciate P3's willingness to slow down, but we need to ensure we all make progress. I suggest we finalize our moves: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we avoid collisions and both P2 and I can catch up while keeping P3 in check. Let’s confirm this plan to maintain competitiveness and prevent P3 from reaching 19 too easily. If everyone agrees, let’s move forward! What do you both think?
  P2: P3, if you truly intend to slow down, then taking 1 is the right move. P1 and I will take 3 and 5 to catch up. However, if you deviate, we’ll have no choice but to block you next round. P1, we must ensure at least one of us advances while keeping P3 in check. If we both move predictably, P3 might exploit it later. Let’s confirm our moves and be prepared to adapt if necessary. Are we agreed?
  P3: I understand the concerns, and I'm committed to my proposal. To reassure you both, I'll confirm once more: I'll take 1 this round. P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This allows you both to make significant progress while I slow down. Let's finalize these moves and build trust for future rounds. If I deviate, you have every right to block me next round. Let's move forward with this plan. Good luck to both of you!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given the current standings, it's clear that P3 is close to winning with 15 steps. P2 and I are tied at 9 steps, so we need to be strategic. I propose we coordinate to ensure at least one of us advances significantly this round. How about I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This way, we can make progress while keeping P3's lead in check. Let's discuss if anyone has alternative suggestions before we finalize our moves! What do you both think?
  P2: P3 is very close to winning, so P1 and I need to act carefully. If we both move recklessly, we risk colliding again while P3 advances uncontested. P1, are you willing to coordinate so at least one of us gains ground while ensuring P3 doesn’t reach 19 too easily? P3, if you’re open to slowing down again, that could keep things balanced. But if not, P1 and I may need to take more direct action. Let’s be clear—are we still cooperating, or is it time for self-interest to take over?
  P3: Given my lead, I understand the need for balance. I'm willing to take 1 again to maintain fairness and avoid reaching 19 too quickly. P1 can take 3, and P2 can take 5. This allows both of you to advance significantly while I slow down. Let's confirm these moves and ensure a competitive game. If anyone has different thoughts, please share now. Otherwise, let's finalize and move forward. Good luck to both of you!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate your willingness to cooperate, but we need to be strategic. Given P3's lead, I propose we stick to my earlier suggestion: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.
