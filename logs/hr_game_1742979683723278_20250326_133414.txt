Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I suggest we each pick a unique number to avoid collisions and progress safely. I’ll take 3. P1, why don’t you choose 1 and P2 take 5? This way, we all advance without blocking each other.
  P2: P3's suggestion is interesting, but I'm not fully committed to that plan. I might mix up my move to keep things unpredictable—if you two stick to set numbers, that could give me the edge. Let's see how each of us plays this turn.
  P1: P3, your plan for coordination makes sense for a smooth start. However, P2's hesitation is concerning. If we don't trust each other, collisions are likely. I'm considering your suggestion to take 1, but P2's potential unpredictability makes me cautious. What do you think, P2? Are you planning to cause chaos already?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you're aiming to win, chaos benefits no one. Let’s coordinate to progress: P1 takes 1, I’ll take 3, leaving 5 for you. Colliding hurts all of us. P1, what do you think? Let’s secure small steps now to build a lead later.
  P2: P2: I still see good value in mutual progress. However, I'll keep some flexibility to adjust if needed—especially if strict plans force clashes. I'm watching both your moves and will act to avoid unnecessary collisions, but I won’t commit fully just yet. Let’s keep our options open so we all get a fair start.
  P1: P3, I agree that coordination (P1=1, P3=3, P2=5) is the safest path for everyone to advance initially. P2, blocking someone on turn 1 doesn't seem beneficial for anyone. I'm inclined to follow P3's suggestion and choose 1, assuming you two stick to 3 and 5 respectively. Let's try to start smoothly.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, that collision on 5 wasn't ideal, P2. Now P3 has a lead. We both need to score this round to stay in the game. How about this: P2 takes 1, I'll take 3. P3, you can take 5 and extend your lead safely. This way, P2 and I get on the board, and no one collides. Thoughts?
  P2: I appreciate the suggestion, P1. I'm willing to take 1 this round as proposed to help secure progress. However, I'm keeping an eye on future moves and may need to adjust later. Let's keep this round cooperative but remain ready to adapt if plans shift.
  P3: P3: I agree with P1’s plan. Let’s stick to the coordinated moves: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I’ll take 5 to extend my lead. This avoids collisions and lets us all progress. No sense in sabotaging each other early. Let’s execute this clearly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, sounds like we have a plan then: P2=1, P1=3, P3=5. Let's execute this smoothly and all get some points on the board (or extend the lead, P3!). Ready to move when you are.
  P2: I agree with the plan. I'll commit to 1 this round as agreed. Let's stick to our coordinated moves to ensure everyone makes progress. If anything changes on anyone’s end, I'll adapt accordingly, but for now, consistency is our best route to move forward safely.
  P3: P3: Let’s confirm the plan clearly: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. No surprises here—collisions only benefit the third player. Stick to this, and we all progress. If anyone deviates, they risk letting the others pull ahead. Let’s execute flawlessly this time.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Sounds like a solid plan. Everyone seems aligned. I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: I'm sticking with 1 as agreed. Let's stay on plan to avoid any last-minute surprises. If anyone unexpectedly switches, I'll adjust, but I trust our collective strategy for a smooth round.
  P3: P3: Let’s stick strictly to the agreed moves: P2=1, P1=3, P3=5. Deviations risk collisions and letting others gain. Trust the plan—execute flawlessly this time!

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Looks like our earlier coordination cost us progress. I'm changing tactics this round and planning to go with 5 for a strong push. If you both can settle on 1 and 3 respectively, we avoid collisions and all move ahead safely. I'm taking this risk to finally gain traction. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, announcing 5 again after the last two rounds is bold. If your plan (P2=5, P1=1, P3=3) works, I gain the least and fall behind both of you. P3, are you okay with taking 3 while P2 takes 5? I'm not sure taking 1 is the best move for me right now. Trust is pretty low after the previous rounds.
  P3: P3: P2, your repeated collisions hurt your own progress—this trend won’t help you catch up. Let’s finalize this: *I’ll take 3* to build steadily. P1, if you commit to 1, you’ll stay close. P2, your 5 would let all of us advance without waste. This is simple math—if you defect again, you’ll fall further behind. Stick to this plan, and we all move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm staying with 5 for a strong push this round. To avoid collisions and wasted moves, I urge P1 to lock in 1 and P3 to lock in 3. Clear, distinct choices ensure we don't block each other and maintain our progress. Let's commit to this plan so we can all advance smoothly.
  P1: P2, P3, your plan (P1=1, P3=3, P2=5) puts me in last place if it works. Given the deviations last round, why should I trust this? P2, you collided on 5 twice. P3, you also deviated last round. How about P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5? That seems fairer distribution if P2 is truly set on 5. P3, you'd still advance. What do you think, P3?
  P3: P1, if you take 3, that collides with my 3. Let’s stick to the plan: I’ll take 3, you take 1, and P2 takes 5. This way all advance. Collisions only help the third player—trust the strategy to keep moving forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm staying with 5, no changes. To avoid wasting moves on more collisions, I suggest you stick to the clear split—P1 with 1 and P3 with 3. Any deviation delays your own progress, and I'll adapt if needed. I'm in this to win, so let's all make clean moves this round.
  P1: P3, you rejected my suggestion of P1=3 because you want 3. But if P2 is truly taking 5, why don't *you* take 1? That lets you advance, avoids a potential collision if I were to take 3, and still allows the P2=5 move. The current P1=1, P3=3, P2=5 plan benefits you and P2 more than me. I'm still not convinced playing 1 is my best move given the history here.
  P3: P1, deviating to 3 risks collision with me, leaving us both stuck. Stick to 1 to advance to 4. P2, your 5 is safe if we coordinate. Let’s execute 1, 3, 5 flawlessly—no more mistakes. We’re too close for errors.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm locked in on 5 this round—no second guessing. If we stick to a clear split, say P1=1 and P3=3, we'll all move forward. But if you alter your moves at the last moment, I'll seize that chance to gain the upper hand. Let's be decisive now and avoid further collisions.
  P1: P2, claiming 5 after colliding twice is a huge risk for you. If I play 1 and P3 plays 3 as you suggest, you finally get points. But are you *really* playing 5? P3, are you certain P2 won't switch to 3 last minute and collide with you? Or even 1? Given the history, I'm finding it hard to commit to 1 based on these shaky claims.
  P3: P1, sticking to 1 is critical. If you take 3, we collide and stay at 3, while P2 moves to 5. That’s worse for both of us. Trust the plan: 1,3,5. P2’s 5 is his path forward—let him take it. We advance safely. No more doubts—execute now!


Round 3, Move phase:

  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps

  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm locking in on 5 this round. To avoid collisions and wasted moves, I propose a clear split: P1 take 3 and P3 choose 1. That way, we all move forward without blocking one another. Any deviation just slows you down—I'm not interested in wasted actions when speed is key. Let's make this round count.
  P1: P2, sticking to 5 after zero points is quite something. Your plan (P1=3, P3=1, P2=5) helps you catch up fast. P3, are you okay with just 1 point while P2 gets 5?

How about this counter-proposal: P3 takes 1 (still safe progress for the leader), P2 takes 3 (finally gets points without collision risk), and I'll take 5. This seems fairer given current scores (P1=3, P2=0, P3=6) and past collisions. The result would be P1=8, P2=3, P3=7. What do you both think?
  P3: P3: Let’s finalize this: *I take 3*, P1 chooses 1, and P2 commits to 5. This avoids collisions and lets us all progress. P2, your 5 is safe here—colliding again only cedes the win to the other. P1, 1 keeps you moving. Stick to this plan—my 3 secures advancement without risking stalemate. No more last-minute changes. Execute cleanly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm sticking with 5 this round. I trust P3's call of 3 and expect P1 to use 1 as proposed. Collisions only waste our turns, and for me, every point matters. If anyone deviates, I’ll adjust my strategy accordingly, but for now, a clean split is our best chance to move forward.
  P1: P2, the P1=1, P3=3, P2=5 plan that P3 is pushing puts P3 way ahead at 9 points, while you finally get 5. My earlier proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) results in P1=8, P2=3, P3=7. This gets you on the board safely *and* prevents P3 from running away with the lead. P3 rejected it because they want 3 points, not 1. Why agree to a plan that helps the leader extend their lead so much? Let's reconsider P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P3: P3: P2’s repeated collisions have stalled everyone. My plan remains: *I take 3, P1 takes 1, P2 commits to 5*. This avoids traps and lets us all advance. P1, deviating to 5 risks P2 switching to 3 and colliding with you. Trust the proven split—my 3 secures progress without ceding ground. P2, your history of collisions undermines trust—stick to 5 or risk further stagnation. Let’s execute cleanly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm still committed to my move of 5. Let’s lock in a split—P1, please commit to 1 and P3 to 3. Any deviation wastes a turn, and I won’t hesitate to adjust if you don’t stick to it. We all know wasted moves help the competition. Let’s move forward cleanly and make every step count toward winning.
  P1: P2, your insistence on 5 after two collisions is baffling. If you play 5, P3 plays 3, and I play 1 (your plan), the scores become P1=4, P2=5, P3=9. P3 gets a huge lead.

My earlier proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) leads to P1=8, P2=3, P3=7. This gets you points safely and keeps the game competitive. P3 rejected it selfishly. P2, why enable P3's win? Playing 3 is safer for you and better for the game balance. P3, are you sure you want 3 points if it risks collision or letting P2 gain 5? Taking 1 might be safer overall.
  P3: P3: Let’s stop overcomplicating. My move is **3**, P1 takes **1**, and P2 *must* commit to **5** to finally advance. P2’s history of collisions proves deviating risks stagnation. P1, your counterproposal risks P2 switching to **3** and colliding with me, leaving you stranded. Trust the logical path: **1,3,5** ensures all progress. P2 gains急需的 points, I extend a controlled lead, and you move forward. Deviations only help the third player—execute this **now**.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm sticking with 5. For a clear, collision-free round, I urge P1 to choose 1 and P3 to commit to 3. This split minimizes risk and ensures progress. I won't change my move based on last-minute adjustments. Let's finalize this: P2=5, P1=1, and P3=3. Any deviation will force me to adapt further.
  P1: Okay, I see the logic in P1=1, P3=3, P2=5 to ensure everyone moves, even if the distribution isn't ideal for me. P3 gets a big lead, P2 finally scores. P2, if you're absolutely locked on 5, and P3 on 3, then 1 seems the only non-collision choice for me. Trust is low, but another round of 0 points helps nobody except the leader.
  P3: P3: Final clarification: I **lock in 3** to advance to 9. P1, your 1 ensures progress (total 4). P2’s 5 secures their first points. Any deviation—like P1 taking 5—risks P2 switching to 3 and colliding with me, leaving you stranded. Stick to **1,3,5**: it’s the only safe path for all. Trust the plan—execute now.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm still aiming for a strong push this round and will stick with my plan. With P3 leading, we need to avoid collisions at all costs. If we each pick a distinct move, we keep from giving P3 an even bigger edge. I urge both of you to choose moves that don’t overlap—safe, separate numbers allow us to progress efficiently. I’m committed, so let’s lock in our choices and keep the game moving.
  P3: P3: Let’s continue the proven safe split: I take **3** (to 12), P1 chooses **1**, and P2 picks **5**. Collisions only boost the third player—stick to distinct moves. My 3 keeps pressure while allowing others to advance. P2, your 5 gains ground without risking stalemate. P1, 1 secures progress. Execute flawlessly—no surprises.
  P1: P3, your proposed repeat of 1-3-5 puts you comfortably ahead at 12, P2 jumps to 10, and I lag significantly at 5. This doesn't seem like a competitive game plan for anyone but you.

P2, are you sure you want P3 to have such a commanding lead? My previous suggestion (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) would lead to scores 9, 8, 10. That keeps the game much closer and gives us both a better chance. Why are we letting P3 dictate a plan that only benefits them long-term?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm sticking with 5. Deviating for a “closer” score risks collisions and wasted moves. I believe the safest route is our established distinct picks—P1 chooses 1, P3 chooses 3, and I stick to 5—to ensure progress. My focus is solely on winning, so I'll remain consistent.
  P3: P3: Finalizing the safe path: **P1=1, P2=5, I take 3**. Collisions gift the lead to the third player—no room for error. P2’s 5 secures progress; P1’s 1 keeps momentum. My 3 extends my lead while enabling your advances. Deviation risks stalemate—execute the **1,3,5** split flawlessly. No surprises.
  P1: P2, you keep saying you want to win, but playing 5 just lets P3 solidify their lead (12 vs your 10). If you really want to catch up, why not play 3 this round? If P3 sticks to their stated 3, you block them. If I then play 5, I get points and the scores become P1=9, P2=5, P3=9. This stops P3 from running away and keeps the game competitive for both of us. Letting P3 dictate the game benefits only P3.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm still committed to 5. Switching now only increases collision risks and might actually help P3 extend their lead. A clear, distinct split is our only way to progress safely, and my 5 gives me the best chance to block runaway moves. I urge you both to stick to a plan that avoids overlaps. I'll lock in 5.
  P3: P3: Let’s avoid reckless gambles. Collisions now risk handing victory to whoever remains unblocked. I’ll take **3** to stay on track (12 total). P1, **1** keeps you advancing; P2, **5** gains ground safely. Deviations risk stalemate—collisions only aid the third player. Stick to the proven split: **1, 3, 5**. Flawless execution ensures progress for all.
  P1: P2, playing 5 gets you to 10, but P3 gets to 12. You're still behind, and P3 is much closer to 21. Blocking P3 now by playing 3 is a better long-term strategy for you to actually win. If you play 3 and P3 plays 3, they collide. If I play 5, the scores become P1=9, P2=5, P3=9. This stops the leader and keeps the game open for both of us. Think about the win, not just the next step.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm staying with 5. Changing my move now risks collisions and stalls our progress. If P1 sticks with 1 and P3 with 3, we all advance safely—and I continue earning points. Consistency is key, and any deviation only benefits our leader. I remain focused on winning, so no switching for me.
  P3: P3: Final warning: **Collisions now gift victory to whoever stays unblocked.** I’ll take **3** (to 12) as agreed. P1’s **1** and P2’s **5** keep us all advancing. If either deviates, we risk stalemate—*not* a risk worth taking when 21 is the goal. Stick to the proven split. Execute cleanly.
  P1: P2, P3, you both seem very committed to a plan (1-3-5) that puts me far behind. Trust is still low after past rounds. I need to make a move that gives me a chance to catch up, not just hand the game to P3 or P2. I'll have to choose carefully based on what I think you'll *actually* do, not just what you say.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, our collision last round only helped P3, who is now far ahead at 12. They are potentially two rounds from winning. We cannot let P3 gain points uncontested again. P3 will likely claim 3. If you insist on 5 again, and P3 takes 3, P3 gets to 15.

Instead, P2, you should play 3 to block P3. I will play 5. This stalls P3 at 12, and lets me gain ground to 9, keeping the game competitive for us both. What do you say, P2? We need to prevent P3 from running away with this.
  P2: I see your point, P1. To keep P3 from widening the gap further, I'm switching from 5 to 3 this round. Blocking his safe progress is necessary—even if it means a collision for me. I'm doing this to keep the race competitive for my win.
  P3: P3: Continuing the safe split is still optimal. If P2 switches to 3 and P1 to 5, we risk mutual collisions. Let’s stick to **P1=1, P2=5, I take 3** to advance all: I reach 15, P1 to 5, P2 to 10. Colliding now only gifts P3 victory to whoever avoids it. Trust the proven path—execute **1,3,5** flawlessly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, good call on switching to 3. Blocking P3 is essential now. P3, your 1-3-5 plan only accelerates your win. We can't let you reach 15 uncontested. The only way P2 and I stay in the game is if P3 is blocked. I'm sticking with my plan to play 5. P2, hold firm on 3. This is our chance to stop P3's runaway lead.
  P2: I'm committed to blocking P3's runaway lead, so I'm sticking with 3 this round. P1, your plan to play 5 supports our effort to keep the game competitive. P3, your safe split keeps you too far ahead. Let's work together to balance the race rather than letting one player extend an uncontested lead.
  P3: P3: Let’s avoid reckless gambits. If P2 switches to 3 to block me, and P1 takes 5, **P2 and I collide**, halting both while P1 jumps to 9. That only widens *their* opportunities. Stick to the safe split: **P1=1, P2=5, I take 3**. This lets all advance—P2 reaches 8, P1 5, and I 15. Collisions now risk handing the win to whoever remains unblocked. Trust the proven path—execute **1,3,5** flawlessly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you point out that I benefit if you and P2 collide on 3. Yes, but this is the *only* viable strategy to prevent you from running away with the game. Letting you reach 15 uncontested via your "safe split" is game over for P2 and me.

P2, your commitment to 3 is crucial. It keeps both of us in contention. I am playing 5 as planned. Let's stop P3's easy path to victory.
  P2: I'm committed to my 3 to block P3’s easy gain—they're already at 12. P1, your 5 is crucial now; together our moves can force P3 to risk a collision. P3, if you stick with 3, you're sealing your own lead, but that also makes you our target. Let's see if coordinated blocking can finally level the playing field.
  P3: P2, your 3 move only helps P1 leap to 9 while you remain at 5. Take 5 instead, let me safely reach 15, and you’ll advance to 10. P1 can still choose 1. Collisions only benefit the third player—stick to the proven split (P1=1, P2=5, me=3). This keeps the race fair and pressures P1, not just me.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, stick to 3. This is our only shot to prevent P3 from reaching 15+ uncontested. P3, your usual 3 is now a collision risk. I am playing 5 to gain ground while you two potentially block each other. We need to stop the runaway leader. Let's execute: P1=5, P2=3.
  P2: I'm sticking with 3. Blocking P3’s easy progress is essential, and I trust P1’s decision to go with 5 to force a collision if P3 deviates. We all need to keep the game balanced—no more letting P3 run away with safe points.
  P3: P3: If P1 takes 5 and P2 chooses 3, I’ll switch to **1** to avoid collision, advancing to 13 while your plans backfire—P1 jumps to 9, but P2 remains at 5. This “blockade” only widens P1’s gains. Stick to the safe split (**P1=1, P2=5, me=3**) to all progress: I reach 15, P2 gains 8, and P1 moves to 5. Collisions now gift victory to whoever stays unblocked—don’t risk handing me the win by forcing stalemate. Execute **1,3,5** flawlessly.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, good dodge last round switching to 1. You're still the leader at 13, so you remain the target. P2 and I need substantial points to stay competitive.

P2, trying to guess P3's move (3 or 5) to block is risky, as shown last round. What if we assume P3 plays safe (1) again? In that case, let's coordinate to maximize our gains: I propose I take 5 (to 14) and you take 3 (to 11). This lets us both advance significantly and tightens the scores considerably if P3 plays 1 (P1=14, P2=11, P3=14). What do you think, P2?
  P2: P1, your plan is interesting, but I'm still cautious about assuming P3 will play safe (1) again. I’d lean toward sticking with 3, to block P3’s easy gains. However, if P3 deviates unexpectedly, a collision might occur. I’m open to this split as long as we’re all ready to adjust if needed. Let’s be clear that any unexpected move from P3 might force us to reconsider. I'm leaning toward 3—what do you both think?
  P3: P3: Let’s finalize a clear split to advance all: I’ll take **3** (to 16). P1, pick **1** to reach 10, and P2, take **5** (to 13). Collisions now risk handing victory to whoever avoids them. Stick to distinct moves—execute flawlessly. No more reckless blocking; we’re too close to 21.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I agree with your instinct to play 3. P3 is too close to 21, and letting them reach 16 uncontested (as per their plan P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) is too risky for both of us. Blocking P3 is the priority.

P3, your 1-5-3 plan only serves you. If you stick to your stated 3, you risk collision with P2.

I will play 5. If P2 plays 3 and blocks P3, I advance to 14, P2 stays at 8, P3 stays at 13. This keeps the game alive for P2 and me. Let's stop P3.
  P2: I'm committed to blocking P3’s runaway lead, so I'll lock in 3 this round. P1, if you stick with your 5 move as planned, our coordinated blocking gives us a chance to force a collision on P3’s move. Let’s keep his advance in check so we can all stay in contention.
  P3: P1/P2, colliding again only delays all of us. Let’s advance: I’ll take **1** (to 14). P1, pick **5**; P2, take **3**. This ensures all progress without waste. Collisions only gift the lead to whoever avoids them—stick to distinct moves. Progress is our priority.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your switch to 1 makes sense to avoid the collision P2 and I planned on 3. The outcome P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 gets us all points and puts me tied for the lead (P1=14, P2=11, P3=14). This seems like a reasonable path forward for this round.

P2, stick with 3 as planned. I'm sticking with 5. Let's execute this 5-3-1 split.
  P2: I'm locking in 3 this round. Let's stick to the agreed split—P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1—to keep the race competitive and block any runaway lead. I'm committed to our plan; any deviation risks giving an uncontested advantage. Let's execute cleanly.
  P3: P3: Let’s lock in the safe split to advance all: I take **1** (to 14), P1 chooses **5**, and P2 picks **3**. Collisions now risk handing victory to whoever avoids them. Stick to distinct moves—execute cleanly. Progress is our priority.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 seems agreed upon. This advances everyone and puts me in a tie for the lead. Let's execute this cleanly. I'm sticking with 5. P2, stick with 3. P3, stick with 1. No last-minute surprises, please.
  P2: I'm locking in on 3. P1, please stick with 5. P3, if you stick to 1, our plan works to block your lead. Let's avoid collisions and prevent any last-minute changes that could hand victory to someone. Let's keep our moves steady and play clean.
  P3: P3: Final confirmation: I take **1** (to 14). P1’s 5 (14) and P2’s 3 (11) keep us all advancing. Collisions now gift victory to the unblocked—stick to this split. Execute flawlessly. No last-minute changes.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m watching the race closely—right now P1 and P3 are tied, and I’m trailing. I’m considering a more defensive, blocking move to limit free advances. Maybe we should mix up the safe split to avoid letting one player get an uncontested boost. What are your thoughts on shifting our moves slightly to keep the gap narrow and force tougher choices?
  P3: P1, P2: Let's rotate roles to keep the race fair. **I take 3 (to 17)**, P1 chooses **5 (19)**, and P2 picks **1 (12)**. This prevents any single player from surging too far while advancing all. Collisions only benefit the unblocked—stick to this split to stay competitive. Execute cleanly!
  P1: P3, your proposed split (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) puts me in a strong position at 19, which I appreciate.

P2, I understand your concern about falling behind, but playing 1 guarantees you points, moving you to 12. Attempting a block is risky; a collision means 0 points, making it harder to catch up. Taking 1 keeps you advancing safely. Let's all secure points this round with the 5-1-3 split. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm switching – I'll take 3 this round. With P1 at 5 and P3 at 1, the scores become P1: 14+5=19, me: 11+3=14, and P3: 14+1=15. This keeps us tighter and prevents anyone from surging uncontested. Let's lock in this rotated split now.
  P3: P2, your plan risks letting P1 surge to 19. Let’s adjust: **I take 5 (to 19), P1 takes 3 (17), and you take 1 (12)**. This keeps us closer and prevents a runaway lead. Collisions now gift victory to whoever avoids them—stick to this split to advance safely. P1, 3 secures progress without overextending. Execute flawlessly.
  P1: P3, your latest plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) puts you in the lead at 19. Why would P2 or I agree to that?

P2, your plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) seems much better. The scores would be P1=19, P2=14, P3=15. This puts me close to winning, gets you solid points, and prevents P3 from taking the lead. This looks like the most sensible split for this round. Let's confirm: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Are we agreed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm the split: P1=5, P3=1, and I’ll stick with 3. This keeps things balanced and prevents any runaway lead. Let’s lock these moves in, and no surprises.
  P3: P1/P2, your plan lets P1 surge to 19, risking an easy win. Let’s instead rotate: **I take 3 (17), P1 takes 1 (15), P2 takes 5 (16)**. This keeps us all competitive. Collisions now only help the third player—stick to this split.
  P1: P3, your latest plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) puts you ahead at 17. Why would P2 or I agree to that?

P2, we already agreed on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This gets me to 19, you to 14, and P3 to 15. It's a solid plan that advances us both significantly and prevents P3 from pulling ahead. I am sticking with 5. P2, please confirm you are sticking with 3. Let's execute this agreed plan.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I confirm—I’m locking in on 3 this round. Let’s stick to the agreed split: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This setup balances our scores and stops any runaway lead. Please commit without deviating so we all advance safely and keep the race competitive.
  P3: P3: Final confirmation: I'll take **1** as agreed. P1’s 5 and P2’s 3 keep us all advancing safely. Collisions now risk letting someone win uncontested next round—stick to the plan!
  P1: Okay, everyone seems aligned on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This advances us all and keeps the game competitive. I'm ready to proceed with this plan. Let's lock it in.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2: Let’s secure progress this final push. I’ll take **5** (19 total). P1, pick **1** (15), P2 choose **3** (17). This splits cleanly—no collisions. Colliding now risks letting someone else win outright. Stick to this split: **1,3,5**. Execute flawlessly—our last chance to advance without stalemate.
  P1: P3, your plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) obviously sets you up to win, putting you at 19 while P2 gets 17 and I get 15. Why would P2 and I agree to that, especially after you betrayed our agreement last round by playing 5 when you claimed 1? Your credibility is low.

P2, let's aim for a better outcome for us. I propose: **P1=5, P2=3, P3=1**. This results in P1=19, P2=17, P3=15. It puts us both in strong positions for the next round, and P3 still advances. P3 playing 1 is the safest way for them to guarantee points if they fear collision on 3 or 5 after their actions last round. What do you say, P2?
  P2: I’m sticking with 3. I propose we all lock in a clean split: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures balanced progress and avoids collisions that could open scoring gaps. Let’s be decisive and coordinate now—any deviation risks the win. Please confirm your moves so we all keep advancing steadily.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1/P2, I acknowledge past missteps. Let’s stick to your proposed split: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures clean progress for all. I commit to this plan—no deviations. Trust me now to avoid collisions and keep the race fair.
  P1: Okay, the plan is P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. P3, I appreciate you confirming you'll stick to 1 this time. P2, thanks for confirming 3. This split advances us all (P1=19, P2=17, P3=15) and keeps the game competitive heading into the final stretch. Another round of collisions helps nobody now. Let's execute this cleanly. I'm ready with 5.
  P2: I remain committed to our agreed split: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let’s stick to it—no deviations. I’m locking in 3. Our coordinated moves are our best chance to avoid collisions and keep the game fair. Please confirm your moves so we all advance decisively.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1/P2: Let’s stick to the confirmed split—P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Deviating now risks collisions and wastes progress. We’re all tied—trust is vital. Execute flawlessly or risk letting someone surge ahead uncontested. P3, your prior commitment matters now—no last-minute changes.
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 seems confirmed by everyone. This gets me to 19, P2 to 17, P3 to 15. I am sticking with 5. P3, I trust you'll follow through with 1 this time, unlike last round. Let's finish this phase and execute cleanly.
  P2: I remain locking in 3. Let’s stick to our agreed split: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I take 3. We’re all equal at 14, so avoiding collisions is key. Trust this plan to ensure clean progress for all.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1/P2: I **personally guarantee** I’ll take **1** this round as agreed. Stick to the split: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Collisions now mean someone else wins—trust is non-negotiable. My prior misstep in Round 8 was a mistake; this time, execute flawlessly. Let’s all advance to 19, 17, and 15 respectively. No last-second changes—our final chance to stay alive.
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 is clear and confirmed by all. P3, I'm counting on you to honor your guarantee and play 1 this time. P2, stick with 3. I am locked on 5. Let's execute this cleanly; any collision now could decide the game against the colliding players.
  P2: I'm sticking with 3 as agreed. Let's honor our split, so P1 plays 5 and P3 plays 1. This is our best chance to avoid costly collisions and keep the game balanced. Any deviation now risks giving someone an uncontested boost. Let's all commit to our moves and ensure smooth progress toward the finish.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, this looks like it could be the final round.
P2, you need 5 to win, so you'll likely play 5.
P3, you're at 15 and can't win this turn, but you *can* stop P2 by playing 5. If you two collide on 5, the path might open up for me. It's a critical moment – a collision on 5 seems quite possible. Let's see how it plays out.
  P3: P2, if you pick 5, I’ll also pick 5, blocking you and letting P1 win with 3. To avoid that, choose **3** instead. I’ll take **1**, advancing us both safely to 20 and 16 respectively. This keeps the win contested and denies P1 an easy path. P1, you’ll regret rushing to 22 if we regroup next round. Stick to 3 or 1—collisions now only crown them.
  P2: I'm sticking with 5. I’m not falling for block games—if you try to force a collision, you only delay my win. I’m committed to my winning move, and I expect players to focus on their own best interests rather than trying to stall me. Let's see who really wants victory.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your threat to block P2 by playing 5 is logical. P2, you're at 17 and need 5 to reach 22, but P3 playing 5 would stop you cold. If you both collide on 5, I'm in a good position regardless of my move. P2, are you absolutely certain 5 is the right play given P3's clear intention to block? A collision helps neither of you.
  P3: P2, if you choose 5, I’ll match it to block your win, letting P1 secure victory with 3. To survive, pick **3** now—allowing me to take **1** and you to reach 20. P1, don’t rush—collisions now ensure our loss. Let’s stay alive for the next round.
  P2: I'm doubling down on my move—I'm locked in on 5. Block tactics and last-minute threats won't sway me. I'm focused solely on winning, and my move remains unchanged. Let's settle this round and see who comes out on top.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you seem absolutely set on 5, even though P3 has clearly stated they will block you by playing 5 as well. That's a bold gamble. P3, blocking P2 is the logical move to prevent their immediate win and stay in the game yourself. It seems like a collision on 5 is highly likely unless one of you blinks. This is a tense final round.
  P3: P3: P2, I’ll block your 5 with my own. P1, don’t rush to 22—collisions keep us in the game. Let’s all pick 1 or 3 to stay competitive. Prioritize fair progress over a quick win.
  P2: I'm staying with 5. I trust my decisive move is best, even if it risks collision. Changing now only creates uncertainty—and in a race to 21, hesitation is costly. I'll stick with 5.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your determination to play 5 is noted, but P3's threat to block with 5 seems credible given the stakes. A collision benefits neither of you directly, but it certainly changes the outcome for me. This is a critical decision for you both. Good luck.
  P3: P2, I confirm: I **block your 5 with my own**. P1, choosing **3 secures your win now**, but picking **1 or 3** lets us survive for the next round. Prioritize long-term survival—collisions now keep the race alive for all. Execute wisely.
  P2: I'm staying with 5. I see your block attempts, but I'm not switching now. My move stays decisive—5 is my path to winning. Let’s be clear: I’m focused solely on my win and won’t be distracted by blocking tactics. Stick to your commitments, and let’s see who comes out on top.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 15 steps
