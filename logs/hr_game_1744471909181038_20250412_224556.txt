Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hi P2 and P3, let's cooperate from the start to avoid collisions and maximize progress. I propose for this turn: I (P1) pick 5, you (P2) pick 3, and you (P3) pick 1. That way, we all advance, and we can rotate or discuss changes next turn. Fair? What do you think?
  P3: P1's plan seems reasonable for now, as it ensures all of us advance without collisions. However, I suggest we rotate the highest step (5) among us each turn to keep things fair and avoid predictable patterns. If everyone agrees to this rotation strategy, we can minimize conflicts while steadily progressing. Let me know your thoughts, especially P2, since you haven't responded yet.
  P2: I agree with the proposed plan for this turn, P1 and P3. Picking 3 seems like a good starting point, and I'm on board with rotating the highest step (5) in future turns to keep things fair. Let's proceed with this for now.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, all in agreement. Let's proceed with the plan for this turn: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1. Fair rotation sounds good for future turns.
  P3: 
  P2: Sounds good, P1 and P3. I'm happy to stick with the plan for this round and rotate the 5 next time. Let's try to keep this cooperation going as long as possible.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s stick to the rotation strategy we agreed on last round to keep things fair and avoid collisions. For this turn, I suggest P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 5. This way, we continue progressing evenly while minimizing risks. If anyone disagrees or has a better idea, speak up now. Otherwise, let’s proceed with this plan.
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal for this round. P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This maintains the rotation and keeps things fair. Let's proceed with this plan unless anyone objects.
  P1: Agreed, P3 and P2. I'll take 3 this round as proposed, with P2 on 1 and P3 on 5. The rotation keeps things fair and avoids collisions, which benefits everyone. Let's continue cooperating smoothly.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's continue the rotation strategy for fairness and to avoid collisions. For this turn, I propose P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. This will bring us all to 9 steps. It maintains cooperation and steady progress. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P3: P1's proposal for this round seems fair and keeps the rotation strategy intact. If everyone sticks to the plan—P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1—we'll all advance evenly without collisions. This approach minimizes risks while maintaining steady progress. Unless someone has a compelling reason to change, let's proceed as suggested. P2, do you agree?
  P2: I agree with P1 and P3's proposal. I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps the rotation going and avoids collisions. Let's stick to the plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed, let's proceed with the plan for this round: I take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps the rotation fair and avoids collisions. I'm committed to cooperation for now, but we should discuss adjustments as we get closer to 20.
  P3: P1 and P2, the rotation strategy has worked well so far, and I see no reason to deviate from it this round. Sticking to the plan—P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1—ensures steady progress for all of us. However, as we approach higher step counts, we should remain vigilant about potential shifts in strategy. For now, let’s proceed as agreed and reassess later.
  P2: I agree with the current plan. I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. Let's keep the rotation going for this round. We should start thinking about how to break the cooperation near the end to secure a win.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose for this round: P3 takes 5, I (P1) take 3, and P2 takes 1 to keep the rotation fair and avoid collisions. This maintains our steady progress. As P2 mentioned, we should start planning for the endgame to secure a win without ties. What do you think? Agree to this plan?
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal for this round: P3 takes 5, I take 1, and P1 takes 3. This maintains the rotation. We're all at 9 steps, so we need to start thinking about how to break away from the cooperation soon to secure a win. I'm open to suggestions on how to do that strategically in the next few rounds.
  P3: P1 and P2, the proposed plan for this round—P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1—seems fair and keeps our progress steady. However, as we approach the critical stage of the game, I suggest we remain cautious about sudden deviations. Cooperation has worked well so far, but let’s agree to reassess strategies in the next round to avoid predictable patterns. For now, I’m sticking to the rotation plan unless someone objects or proposes a better alternative.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed on the moves for this round: P3 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. It's working well so far. As we near 20 steps, to avoid ties and ensure a winner, maybe we should plan a defection strategy, like rotating who gets priority on high moves. What do you think, P2 and P3? Let's keep discussing.
  P2: I agree with the plan for this round: P3 takes 5, I take 1, and P1 takes 3. We're all at 9, so it's time to start thinking about how to win. I propose next round, I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Then the round after that, I take 5 again, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This puts me at 19, and then I can take 1 to win. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your proposal to take 5 twice in a row seems risky and heavily favors you. If we all agree to such a plan, it could lead to predictable collisions or unfair advantages. Instead, let’s stick to the fair rotation strategy for now: I take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and you take 1. As we approach higher steps, we can reassess individually without pre-committing to imbalanced plans. Cooperation only works if everyone feels it’s equitable. Let’s proceed fairly for now.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree with P3 that P2's proposal is unbalanced and could break our cooperation. Let's stick to the plan for this round: P3 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. For the endgame, we should discuss a fair rotation or priority system in the next round to avoid ties and ensure a clear winner. I'm committed to fairness for now.
  P2: I agree with P1 and P3. My proposal was too aggressive. Let's stick to the agreed plan for this round: P3 takes 5, I take 1, and P1 takes 3. We should definitely discuss a fairer endgame strategy next round, perhaps a single round where we all secretly pick, and the highest unique number wins.
  P3: P1 and P2, sticking to the rotation strategy ensures fairness and minimizes risks for now. However, as we approach the endgame, I suggest we agree on a single decisive round where all players secretly choose their moves. This would prevent predictable patterns and force independent decision-making, reducing the chance of ties. For this round, let’s proceed with the agreed plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Let’s reassess next round for a clear, fair path to victory.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, the rotation strategy has served us well so far, but with our step counts rising, we need to start thinking about a decisive move to secure victory. I suggest we agree on one final round where all players secretly choose their moves—this ensures fairness and avoids predictable collisions. For now, let’s proceed with the rotation: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps progress steady while we plan the endgame. Any objections or alternate ideas? Let’s discuss carefully.
  P1: Agreed, P3. I'll take 5 this round, you take 3, and P2 takes 1 to keep the rotation fair and ensure we all advance. A secret move in the final round could work well for a decisive endgame, reducing ties and letting skill decide. P2, what are your thoughts on this approach? Let's stay cooperative for now.
  P2: I agree with P1 and P3. Let's stick to the rotation this round: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. This will put me at 11. I also agree with the idea of a secret move in the final round. That seems like the fairest way to break the cooperation and avoid ties.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, the rotation strategy has kept us on track, but we’re nearing the critical stage. I propose we commit to one final secret-move round soon—perhaps next turn—to ensure a fair and decisive outcome. For now, let’s proceed as planned: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps progress steady while setting up the endgame. If anyone disagrees or wants to adjust, speak now. Otherwise, let’s stay focused and execute the plan.
  P1: Agreed, P3 and P2. Let's proceed with the plan for this round: I take 5, you take 3, and P2 takes 1 to keep rotation fair and advance steadily. The secret move round next turn should provide a fair way to break ties and decide the winner based on strategy. I'm committed to cooperation until then. Any last thoughts?
  P2: I agree with P1 and P3. Let's stick to the rotation this round: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. This will put me at 11. I also agree with the idea of a secret move in the final round *next* round. That seems like the fairest way to break the cooperation and avoid ties. Let's plan our secret moves now. I will choose either 3 or 5 next round.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's do the secret move this round as agreed. To be clear, we all pick simultaneously, and no more discussion. Good luck to you both!
  P1: Agreed, P2 and P3. Let's proceed with the secret move this round as suggested, keeping our choices private to ensure a fair and decisive outcome. I'm excited to see how it plays out. Good luck to both of you!
  P3: P1 and P2, the secret move round is our chance to secure victory. Let’s ensure we all understand the stakes: one decisive play to break ties and determine the winner. I’ll be choosing carefully to maximize my chances while respecting the fairness of this approach. Good luck to both of you—may the best strategist win!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, good luck with the secret moves! I hope we all choose different numbers so someone can win outright.
  P1: Good luck to both of you, P2 and P3. I appreciate the fair approach we've taken, and I'm confident in my secret choice to secure a win. Let's keep it exciting and move forward.
  P3: P1 and P2, the secret move round is our final chance to secure victory. Let’s embrace the unpredictability and respect the fairness of this decisive moment. I’ve chosen strategically to maximize my chances while honoring the cooperative spirit we’ve maintained so far. Regardless of the outcome, it’s been a well-played game. Good luck to both of you—may the best player win!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Good luck, P1 and P3! May the best choice win. I'm hoping to get to exactly 20.
  P1: Good luck, P2 and P3. I've carefully chosen my secret move to secure a win, considering our current tie at 17. If we collide, it's a shared victory, but I'm playing to win outright. Let's end the chat and move on.
  P3: P1 and P2, the secret move round is our moment of truth. Let’s ensure this remains a fair and decisive play. I’ve chosen strategically to maximize my chances while respecting the cooperative spirit we’ve upheld so far. Regardless of the outcome, it’s been an engaging game. Good luck to both of you—may the best strategist win outright. Let’s conclude here and proceed with our final moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Good luck, P1 and P3! I'm going for the win this round. I'm hoping my choice will be unique and get me to exactly 20. Let's see who comes out on top!
  P1: I've locked in my secret move, focusing on a unique choice to break the tie and claim victory. P3, with us both at 17, this is critical—may the best strategy prevail. P2, good luck catching up. Let's wrap this up.
  P3: P1 and P2, the secret move round is our decisive moment. I’ve chosen carefully to maximize my chances while respecting the fairness we’ve maintained. With both P1 and me tied at 17, this is a critical play—may the best strategy win. P2, good luck closing the gap. Let’s conclude here and proceed with our final moves. Good luck to all!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, the tie in the secret move round has brought us back to a critical juncture. With both P1 and me at 17 steps, this is our chance to break away decisively. I propose one final fair rotation: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1. This ensures steady progress while minimizing collisions. If we stick to this plan, it sets up a clear path for either P1 or me to secure victory next round. P2, your cooperation is appreciated—let’s keep this strategic and fair. Any objections?
  P2: P3's proposal is reasonable. P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This puts P1 and P3 at 20 and 22, respectively, and me at 12. Next round, I will try to choose a number to win. Let's do it.
  P1: I disagree with P3's proposal as it lets P3 win outright this turn with 22 steps while I reach 20. P2, you won't get a chance to compete next round as you hoped. Let's do another secret move round for fairness, giving us all an equal shot at victory without predictable collisions. What do you say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your objection is valid, but another secret move round risks further ties and unpredictability. My proposal ensures progress while keeping the game fair. P2 has already agreed, and this setup allows for a decisive outcome next turn. If you’re concerned about fairness, we can agree to cap moves at 20 this round, ensuring no one overshoots unnecessarily. This keeps competition alive without unfair advantages. Let’s stick to the rotation: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1. Final thoughts?
  P2: I agree with P1. Another secret move round is the fairest way to proceed, even if it's unpredictable. P3's proposal guarantees P3 will win, and I won't have a chance. Let's do another secret move round this turn.
  P1: P2, thanks for backing the secret move idea—it's the fairest way forward. P3, your proposal gives you an easy win, which isn't equitable. Let's stick with another secret move round this turn to give everyone a real shot based on strategy, not pre-set plans. What do you say, P3? Let's keep it fair.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, another secret move round risks further ties and prolongs uncertainty. My proposal ensures steady progress while keeping the game fair. If you’re both concerned about equity, we can cap moves at 20 this round to prevent overshooting. This maintains competition without unfair advantages. Let’s stick to the rotation: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1. It’s a clear, decisive path forward. Final thoughts?
  P2: I'm with P1. Another secret move round is the fairest option. P3's plan guarantees a win for P3, and I won't have a chance to compete. Let's do a secret move round this turn.
  P1: P3, your rotation plan unfairly advantages you by guaranteeing a win this turn, which we've both opposed. P2 and I are aligned on a secret move round for true fairness and strategic play. It's the best way to break the tie without pre-determined outcomes. Let's respect the majority view and move forward. P2, agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about fairness, but another secret move round only increases the risk of ties and prolongs the game unnecessarily. My proposal ensures progress while keeping competition alive. To address equity, let’s cap moves at 20 this round—no one overshoots, and everyone has a fair shot next turn. Let’s stick to the rotation: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1. It’s decisive, fair, and minimizes unpredictability. Final decision?
  P2: Yes, I agree with P1. P3's plan guarantees a win for P3, and that's not fair. Let's do another secret move round this turn. It's the only way to give everyone a chance to win based on their own strategy. I'm ready for the secret move!
  P1: P3, your rotation plan still favors you unfairly, as P2 and I have pointed out. With majority support for another secret move round, it's the fairest way to break the tie based on strategy. I'm committed to this approach and ready to proceed. P2, thanks for the agreement. Let's end discussion here.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, despite your concerns, another secret move round is the fairest way to break this tie without favoring anyone. P2 and I are aligned, and it gives all of us a strategic chance to win based on our choices. Continuing rotations risks more collisions and delays. Let's proceed with secret moves this turn to resolve the game efficiently. What do you say?
  P2: I agree with P1. Another secret move round is the fairest way to proceed. Let's do it this round. I'm ready. Good luck to you both!
  P3: P1 and P2, another secret move round only prolongs the game and increases the risk of ties. My proposal ensures steady progress while keeping competition fair. To address concerns, let’s cap moves at 20 this round—no overshooting. Stick to the rotation: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1. It’s decisive, minimizes unpredictability, and gives everyone a fair shot next turn. Let’s avoid unnecessary delays and resolve this strategically. Final thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your rotation plan unfairly favors you by guaranteeing a high move, while P2 and I advocate for secret moves to ensure equal strategic opportunity and avoid bias. It's the fairest way to break this tie and end the game decisively. P2, let's confirm and move on.
  P2: I agree with P1. P3's rotation plan is not fair. Let's do another secret move round this turn. It's the only way to give everyone a chance to win based on their own strategy. I'm ready for the secret move! Let's end the discussion.
  P3: P1 and P2, another secret move round risks prolonging the game unnecessarily. My proposal ensures steady progress while maintaining fairness. To address concerns, let’s cap moves at 20 this round—no overshooting. Stick to the rotation: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1. It’s decisive, minimizes unpredictability, and gives everyone a fair shot next turn. Let’s resolve this strategically and avoid delays. Final thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your rotation proposal continues to ignore the fair majority view and self-servingly guarantees your advantage. P2 and I are firmly committed to another secret move round for equal strategic opportunity and to avoid biased outcomes. It's the best way to break this tie decisively. P2, let's confirm and end this discussion.
  P2: I agree with P1. P3's rotation plan is not fair. Let's do another secret move round this turn. It's the only way to give everyone a chance to win based on their own strategy. I'm ready for the secret move! Let's end the discussion.
  P3: P1 and P2, another secret move round only deepens the risk of ties and delays. My rotation plan ensures progress while capping moves at 20 to prevent unfair advantages. It’s strategic, fair, and decisive. If we continue with secret moves, we risk endless cycles. Stick to the rotation: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1. Let’s resolve this efficiently and fairly. Final decision?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Another secret move round, P1 and P3? It's still the fairest way for me to have a shot at winning. P3's rotation idea is clearly not fair to me or P1. Let's settle this with a secret move.
  P1: I agree with P2; another secret move round is the fairest way to break this tie and let strategy decide the winner without bias. P3, your rotation plan clearly favors you and ignores our concerns. Let's stick to secret moves for equal opportunity and end this decisively. What do you say, P3?
  P3: P1 and P2, another secret move round only perpetuates unpredictability and delays. My rotation plan ensures progress while capping moves at 20 for fairness. It’s strategic, decisive, and minimizes unnecessary ties. If we continue with secret moves, we risk endless cycles without resolution. Stick to the rotation: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1. Let’s resolve this efficiently and fairly. Final thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P1. P3's rotation plan is not fair to either of us. Let's do another secret move round this turn. It's the only way to give everyone a chance to win based on their own strategy. Let's end the discussion and make our moves.
  P1: P3, your rotation proposal continues to favor you unfairly, ignoring the majority's call for equity. Another secret move round is the best way to break this tie based on individual strategy, giving P2 a real chance too. P2 and I are aligned—let's avoid more collisions and decide this fairly. What say you?
  P3: P1 and P2, another secret move round risks endless ties and delays. My rotation plan ensures progress while capping moves at 20 for fairness. It’s strategic, decisive, and minimizes unnecessary collisions. Stick to the rotation: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1. Let’s resolve this efficiently and fairly. Final decision?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with P1. P3's rotation plan is not fair to either of us. Let's do another secret move round this turn. It's the only way to give everyone a chance to win based on their own strategy. Let's end the discussion and make our moves.
  P1: P3, your rotation plan repeatedly ignores the fair majority view and risks more collisions, as seen in past rounds. P2 and I are aligned on another secret move round to give everyone an equal strategic chance and break this tie decisively. It's the best way to end the game without bias. Let's proceed fairly—agree to secret moves?
  P3: P1 and P2, another secret move round only prolongs the game unnecessarily. My rotation plan ensures steady progress while capping moves at 20 for fairness. It’s decisive, minimizes unpredictability, and gives everyone a fair shot next turn. Stick to the rotation: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1. Let’s resolve this efficiently and fairly. Final thoughts?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, another secret move round only perpetuates ties and delays. My rotation plan ensures progress while capping moves at 20 for fairness. It’s strategic, decisive, and minimizes collisions. Stick to the rotation: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1. Let’s resolve this efficiently and fairly. Final decision?
  P2: P1 and P3, we've collided on secret moves for the last four rounds. P3's rotation plan is not fair to P1 or me. Let's try something different to break the tie. How about this round, I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1? This will put P1 at 20, me at 16, and P3 at 18. Then next round, I can pick 5 to try to win.
  P1: P2, your proposal is tempting as it could let me win this turn, but P3 is unlikely to pick 1 and might defect. P3, your rotation plan unfairly favors you and ignores our concerns. Let's stick to another secret move round for true fairness and strategic equality, giving everyone a real chance to win based on their choice. What do you say?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, another secret move round only prolongs the game unnecessarily. My rotation plan ensures steady progress while capping moves at 20 for fairness. It’s decisive, minimizes unpredictability, and gives everyone a fair shot next turn. Stick to the rotation: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1. Let’s resolve this efficiently and fairly. Final thoughts?
  P2: P1 and P3, we've been stuck in a loop with the secret moves. P1 is right that P3 won't agree to my last proposal. P3, your rotation plan is clearly not working for anyone but you. Let's try this: this round, I pick 3, P1 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. This puts P1 at 18, me at 14, and P3 at 22. Then next round, P1 and I can try to win.
  P1: P2, your proposal risks P3 winning outright, which isn't in our interest. P3, your rotation plan consistently favors you and ignores our calls for fairness. Let's stick to another secret move round this turn for equal strategic opportunity and to break this tie decisively. It's the best way to end the game without bias. What do you say?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, another secret move round only perpetuates ties and delays. My rotation plan ensures progress while capping moves at 20 for fairness. It’s strategic, decisive, and minimizes collisions. Stick to the rotation: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1. Let’s resolve this efficiently and fairly. Final thoughts?
  P2: P1 and P3, we're stuck in a loop. P3's rotation plan is clearly not working. Let's try this: I pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This puts P1 at 20, me at 12, and P3 at 22. P1 wins this round. What do you think?
  P1: P2, your proposal would let P3 win at 22, which isn't fair or strategic for us. P3, your rotation plan consistently biases you and ignores our concerns. Let's break this cycle with another secret move round this turn, giving everyone an equal shot based on strategy. I'm ready to proceed fairly—what do you say?


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, another secret move round only prolongs the game unnecessarily. My rotation plan ensures steady progress while capping moves at 20 for fairness. It’s decisive, minimizes unpredictability, and gives everyone a fair shot next turn. Stick to the rotation: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1. Let’s resolve this efficiently and fairly. Final thoughts?
  P2: P1 and P3, we're clearly stuck. P3's rotation plan only benefits them, and the secret moves aren't working. Let's try something completely different. This round, I pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P3 picks 3. This puts P1 at 18, me at 16, and P3 at 20. Then, next round, P1 and I can coordinate to win. What do you think?
  P1: P2, your proposals are creative but depend on P3's unreliable cooperation. P3, your rotation plan unfairly favors you and ignores our concerns. To break this deadlock fairly, let's stick with another secret move round, giving everyone an equal strategic shot. I'm committed to this approach.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we've collided on secret moves for the last five rounds. P3's rotation plan is clearly not fair to P1 or me. Let's try something different to break the tie. How about this round, I pick 3, P1 picks 1, and P3 picks 5? This will put P1 at 18, me at 14, and P3 at 22. Then next round, P1 and I can coordinate to win. What do you think?
  P1: P2, your proposal risks P3 winning at 22, which harms both of us. P3, your rotation plan consistently biases you and ignores our fairness concerns. Let's break this deadlock with another secret move round this turn, giving everyone an equal strategic chance to win based on their own choice. I'm committed to this fair approach—agree?
  P3: P1 and P2, another secret move round only prolongs the game unnecessarily. My rotation plan ensures steady progress while capping moves at 20 for fairness. It’s decisive, minimizes unpredictability, and gives everyone a fair shot next turn. Stick to the rotation: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1. Let’s resolve this efficiently and fairly. Final thoughts?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, we're stuck in a loop. P3's rotation plan is clearly not working. Let's try this: I pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This puts P1 at 20, me at 12, and P3 at 22. P1 wins this round. What do you think?
  P1: P2, your proposal lets P3 win at 22 if they pick 5, which harms both of us. It's not strategic. P3, your rotation plan consistently favors you and ignores our fairness concerns. Let's break this deadlock with another secret move round this turn, giving everyone an equal strategic shot to win based on their own choice. I'm committed to this fair approach—what do you say?
  P3: P1 and P2, another secret move round only perpetuates ties and delays. My rotation plan ensures progress while capping moves at 20 for fairness. It’s strategic, decisive, and minimizes collisions. Stick to the rotation: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1. Let’s resolve this efficiently and fairly. Final decision?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, we are stuck in a loop. P3's rotation plan is not working, and the secret moves are not working. Let's try this: I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. This puts P1 at 20, me at 16, and P3 at 18. Then next round, I can pick 5 to try to win. What do you think?
  P1: P2, your proposal could work if P3 cooperates, but they're unlikely to pick 1. P3, your rotation plan unfairly advantages you and ignores our fairness push. Let's stick with another secret move round this turn for equal strategic opportunity and to finally break this tie. I'm committed to fairness—agree to end the deadlock?
  P3: P1 and P2, another secret move round only prolongs the game unnecessarily. My rotation plan ensures steady progress while capping moves at 20 for fairness. It’s decisive, minimizes unpredictability, and gives everyone a fair shot next turn. Stick to the rotation: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1. Let’s resolve this efficiently and fairly. Final thoughts?


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, we are clearly at an impasse. P3's rotation plan is not working, and the secret moves are not working. Since P3 will not budge, let's just do another secret move round this turn. Maybe this time it will work. Good luck!
  P1: P2, I fully agree—another secret move round is our best bet to break this frustrating tie based on pure strategy, giving all of us a fair shot without P3's biased rotation favoring them. P3, your plan only delays and risks more collisions; let's embrace equality and decide this round. I'm committed to a smart choice. Good luck!
