Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I commit to picking 5 this turn. To avoid collision, let’s have one of you pick 1 and the other pick 3 so we all move. Who’s 1 and who’s 3?
  P3: Sure. I’ll take 3. P2, would you take 1 so we all advance cleanly this round?
  P2: Okay, sounds like a plan to get everyone moving. I'll take 1 this round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Nice clean start last turn. I’m happy to stick with 3 again; P1 keeps 5, P2 keeps 1 so we all keep moving without bumping. Everyone good with that?
  P1: I’m on board—I'll take 5 again this round. P3 on 3, P2 you on 1? Please confirm so we don’t collide.
  P2: Okay, I can take 1 again this round to keep things moving smoothly. But P1, you're pulling ahead quickly with 5 each time. We should probably discuss rotating the numbers starting next round to keep things competitive.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Fair to keep the current plan for THIS turn so no one crashes. But starting next round, if 5 keeps going only to P1, the game’s basically over. So here’s my proposal: we rotate—next round I take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1; round after that P2 takes 5, I 1, P1 3, and so on. If P1 won’t rotate, I’ll mirror whatever P1 picks next round so we both get blocked. Up to you, P1. P2, sound good?
  P1: For this turn let’s stick with P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. Next round: I pick 5, P2 picks 3 (you go to 4), P3 picks 1—no collisions. Then in round 4 we rotate so P2 gets 5. P2, you’d advance more now than under P3’s plan. Anyone object?
  P2: P1, your plan gives you 5 again next round, putting you at 15. That's too close to the win for the rest of us. P3's rotation plan starting next round (R3: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) seems fairer to keep the game competitive.

For *this* round (R2), I'll stick with 1 as we all agreed earlier, assuming P1=5 and P3=3. But we need a fairer rotation from R3 onwards.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Sticking with 3 this turn as agreed. P1, here’s the deal for Round 3 onward:

• If you accept the rotation (R3: P3 = 5, P1 = 3, P2 = 1; then rotate), we all keep moving and no one collides.  
• If you try to keep 5, I will instant-mirror you every time you pick it, so you advance 0. P2 can take 3 and cruise past us both while we sit blocked. Your choice.

P2, I’m committed: if P1 hogs 5, I’ll collide with him; you can safely grab 3. Much nicer for everyone if P1 just rotates.
  P1: Alright, I accept rotation for Round 3: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. Then in Round 4 I’ll take 5, P3 3, P2 1 so everyone still moves each turn. We can revisit Round 5 plans once we see positions. P2, P3, does that work?
  P2: Okay P1, glad we agree on the rotation for Round 3 (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1). I will stick to 1 for this round (R2) as planned.

However, your Round 4 proposal (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) gives you 5 again and puts you at 18 steps, which is too close to the win. The fair rotation P3 implied would be P2=5, P1=3, P3=1 in Round 4. Let's stick to that full rotation for fairness.

I'm ready to move for R2.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m breaking from that rotation. Round 3: I pick 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1. You’d go to 5 (tying me), P3 to 4. P3, if you deviate I’ll mirror your move to keep you locked. P2, that’s a good catch-up—confirm?
  P2: P1, you already broke the rotation agreement last round, and P3 called your bluff and blocked you. Now you're proposing you get 5 *again*, putting you at 10 steps while I only reach 5? That doesn't sound fair or reliable.

P3, are you really going to agree to P1 taking 5 after last round? If P1 insists on 5, maybe you should consider picking 5 again to block them? If you two collide, I could take 3 and reach 5 steps, tying P1. That seems better than letting P1 get to 10.
  P3: P1, last turn showed I’ll block you. Final offer:

R3: I take 5, you take 3, P2 takes 1.  
R4: P2 gets 5, you 3, I 1.  
Then we reassess positions.

If you grab 5 this turn, I mirror 5 every single round—neither of us move while P2 cruises past. I’m 100 % committed to that spite strat, so choose: share 5 fairly or gift the win to P2. 

P2, plan stays: 1 this turn, 5 next, unless P1 forces us to stalemate him.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed—this round I’ll take 3, P3 takes 5, P2 takes 1. No collisions, everyone moves.
  P2: Okay, P1. Glad you agree with P3's plan for this round (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1). I will stick to 1. Let's ensure no collisions this time.
  P3: Fine by me: this round—P3 = 5, P1 = 3, P2 = 1. P1, break it and I mirror you again. Otherwise everyone advances cleanly. Ready to move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 4: I’ll take 3. P2, stick with 1; P3, please take 5 so we all advance cleanly. For Round 5, here’s my proposal: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1—no collisions and we all move. P2, P3, does that work?
  P3: Deal for R4: P3 = 5, P1 = 3, P2 = 1.  
But R5 must rotate: P2 = 5, P1 = 3, P3 = 1.  
P1, if you grab 5 early, I’ll mirror and we both stall while P2 shoots ahead. P2, you good with this?
  P2: Hold on, both P1 and P3, your proposals for Round 4 (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) contradict the rotation we agreed on back in Round 2.

The agreed plan was:
R3: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 (which we just did)
R4: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1 (my turn for 5)

P3, why are you suggesting you take 5 this round when it's my turn according to the plan you proposed?

I'm sticking to the agreed rotation. For Round 4, I should take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the game fair and allows me a chance to catch up as planned. Let's stick to what we agreed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree—let’s stick to the agreed R4 rotation: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1 so everyone advances fairly. For Round 5, I propose P1=5, P3=3, P2=1—no collisions and P2 still catches up. Please confirm so we all move smoothly.
  P3: Okay—stick to the agreed R4: P2 = 5, P1 = 3, I = 1.  

Next round (R5) the rotation continues: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1.  
If anyone grabs 5 out of turn, I instantly mirror and we both stall while the third player races ahead. Fair rotation or deadlock—your call.
  P2: Okay, glad we are all aligned for Round 4: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. I will choose 5 based on this agreement.

Regarding Round 5, P3's proposal (P3=5, P2=3, P1=1) follows the established rotation pattern. Let's stick to that for fairness, but we can confirm at the start of R5.

Ready to move for R4.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s do Round 5 as follows: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3.  

P2, you stay at 9 now and get 5 in R6 as promised.  
P3, you go to 12 this turn—if you pick 5 to block me, you stay at 9 while P2 rockets to 13 next, leaving both of us behind. Better to take 3 now.  

Everyone moves cleanly—any objections?
  P3: Rotation holds: R5 = P3 5, P2 3, P1 1.  
P1, if you touch 5 I mirror you—both stay at 11 while P2 races past. Your “P1 5” proposal is a non-starter.  
P2, 3 this turn puts you at 11, you get 5 next round as planned; good deal.  
So: 5-3-1 or deadlock. Your moves.
  P2: P1, your proposal gives you 5 again, putting you at 16, which is too close to the win. We agreed on a rotation to keep things fair.

P3, your proposal (P3=5, P2=3, P1=1) follows the rotation we established. This keeps the game competitive. I agree with this plan for Round 5. I will choose 3, assuming P1 chooses 1 and you choose 5. Let's stick to the rotation.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed for Round 5: P3 = 5, P2 = 3, P1 = 1. Let’s all move cleanly this turn.
  P3: Confirmed: Round 5 = P3 5, P2 3, P1 1.  
Stick to that or I mirror any rogue 5 and nobody moves.  
We can talk next round about future rotation once the scores are 14-11-12.
  P2: Okay, everyone seems aligned on P3=5, P2=3, P1=1 for this round. I'm ready to move based on that agreement.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:

  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Enough “rotation”—it’s crunch time.

This round (R6) I’m selecting 5.  
If either of you also choose 5 we all stall and the third player makes the only progress, so think twice.  

A clean split that keeps everyone in contention:  
• P1 take 3 (to 14)  
• P2 take 1 (to 12)  
• I take 5 (to 14)  

Nobody gets runaway-distance and no collisions.  
Do whatever you like, but 5 is mine this turn.
  P1: P2, let’s team up: R6 = P1 5, P2 3, P3 1. 

P3, if you pick 5 I’ll mirror you—both stall at 11, while P2 cleanly goes to 14.  

Then in R7, P2 takes 5 to reach 19 and wins, with me blocking P3 again.  

P2, are you in? P3, pick 1 or be locked out.
  P2: P1 and P3, you're both fighting over 5 again. P1 threatens to mirror P3 if they take 5, and P3 seems determined to take 5 regardless. If you two collide, I can simply take 3 and reach 14, leaving you both behind.

P1's plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) puts P1 at 16, which is too close to winning. P3's plan (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) puts me behind at 12 while P1 and P3 tie at 14. Neither plan is ideal for me, but your conflict might just hand me the advantage.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2: I’m hard-locking 5 this round (and every round). If P1 also chooses 5, we both stay frozen at 11 while you move. Best play for you: take 3 now—guaranteed jump to 14.  
• If P1 swerves to 1: scores 14-14-12 (you tied for lead).  
• If P1 collides with me: scores 11-14-11 (you solo lead).  

Either way you’re on top and can grab 5 next turn for the win.  

P1: touch 5 and we both stall indefinitely. Pick 1 or 3 and stay in the game.
  P1: Round 6: I commit to playing 3. P3, you take 5. P2, note:

- If you pick 3, you collide with me, P3 goes to 14 and wins next.  
- If you pick 5, you collide with P3, I go to 14 and win next.  

Your only safe option is 1 (to 12), keeping you alive for R7. Anyone deviates and you hand the win to the third.
  P2: P1, that's a sudden change from wanting 5 to committing to 3. If you play 3, P3 plays 5, and I follow your advice to play 1, the scores become P1=14, P3=14, P2=12. That leaves me behind both of you.

Alternatively, if you two end up colliding on 5 again, I could take 3 and reach 14, taking the lead. Your move to 3 seems risky for you unless you're certain I'll choose 1 and fall behind. Are you sure about playing 3?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m staying on 5.  
Facts on the table: P1 has publicly locked 3.

P2, your outcomes:

1) You pick 1 → no collisions: scores 14-14-12. You’re 2 behind and can grab 5 next turn if we’re still grid-locked.

2) You pick 3 → you and P1 both stall at 11 while I jump to 14. P1 held back, you’re still in—good but not as good as (1).

3) You pick 5 → you collide with me, both frozen at 9/11 while P1 rockets to 14 and likely wins. Worst case.

So 1 or 3 are the rational plays; 5 is disastrous for you.
  P1: P2, pick 1 now (to 12) so there’s no collision. Then in R7 I’ll stick with 3 and you take 5—P3 won’t risk mirroring your 5 (he’d collide with my 3), so you’ll move solo to 17. In R8 you grab 5 and hit 19 to win. If you pick 3 or 5 now you fall behind or gift me the win. So choose 1.
  P2: P1, your sudden switch to 3 after fighting for 5 is hard to trust, especially with that weak promise of helping me win later. P3 seems set on 5. If you both end up choosing 5 again, colliding like you did in Round 5, my best move would clearly be 3 to take the lead at 14. Playing 1, as you suggest P1, only guarantees I fall behind if you *don't* collide. It's a tough choice given the conflicting stories and sudden changes.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3 is obviously going for 5 to win this turn. We can't let that happen. If we both pick 5, we risk colliding while P3 potentially takes 1 or 3 and stays ahead.

How about this: you commit to picking 5 to ensure P3 is blocked. I will pick 3.
If you and P3 collide on 5, I advance to 14, tying P3.
If P3 chooses 1 or 3 (anticipating a block), you get your 5 steps (to 16) and I get 3 (to 14).

This stops P3's win and guarantees one of us makes progress. What do you say?
  P3: I’m still sitting on 5. Anyone else who touches it just freezes beside me and gifts the lead (and likely the game) to the third player next turn.  

P1: if you collide with me on 5, you stay at 11 while P2 jumps to 14 and can take a solo 5 in R8 for the win. Much smarter for you to grab 3 now and keep pace.  

P2: 3 gives you 14 (tied lead) with zero risk. Picking 5 risks a triple-stall at 11-11-14.  

Stay off 5 and no one gets locked. Decide wisely.
  P1: P2, if you pick 1 or 3 this turn, P3 will take 5 and hit 19 to win. Your only way to block him is to join me on 5. I publicly commit to 5. P3, you can’t safely choose 1 or 3 either, since we’ll both take 5 and stall you at 14. 

So let’s both pick 5 and freeze P3. Then in R8 we’ll break with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, putting us both ahead. Everyone sees the logic.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your plan for us both to pick 5 guarantees we both stall at 11. If P3 anticipates this and picks 3, they jump to 17 while we stay put. That's too risky.

My original proposal still stands: You commit to 5 to block P3. I will commit to 3.
- If you and P3 collide on 5, I advance to 14 (tied with P3).
- If P3 picks 1 or 3, you advance to 16, and I advance to 14 (if P3=1) or 12 (if P3=3).

This stops P3 winning and gives me a good chance to advance. Why should I choose 5 and guarantee I get 0 steps? I'll stick with 3, assuming you block P3 with 5.
  P3: P1: your options are simple.

1) Take 3 now → you jump to 14, I risk 5 alone and either win or stay tied with you. You’re back in the race.

2) Take 5 now → I mirror forever. You stay frozen at 11 while P2 races to 19 with clean 5’s. You never catch up.

Block-war only hands P2 the game. Your only path is 3.

P2: if P1 is smart he’s on 3, so 1 is the safe +1 (to 12). If you insist on 3 you risk a collision.

I am staying on 5. Decide.
  P1: P2: P3 is one step from 19 and will grab 5 if unchallenged. Here’s our only sure block:  

Round 7: both you and I choose 5. P3 must pick 5 to win and we all stall at 11.  
Round 8: I pick 3, you pick 5 → you go to 16, I to 14, P3 stays at 11.  
Round 9: you grab 5 and hit 21, winning outright.  

This locks out P3. Will you join me?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I appreciate you committing to 5 to block P3. That's essential. However, me also picking 5 guarantees I get 0 steps this round. Worse, if P3 anticipates this and picks 1 or 3, they advance while we both stall.

The best way to stop P3 AND keep us both competitive is for you to block P3 with 5, while I take 3. If you and P3 collide, I reach 14, tying P3 and keeping the game alive. If P3 swerves, you get 16, I get 14.

I am sticking with 3. Trust me, this is better for both of us than a guaranteed stall for me.
  P3: I am staying on 5—period.

P1: If you also take 5 we both freeze at 11-14 while P2 moves ahead and grabs a solo 5 next turn for the win. Your only sensible play is 3 (to 14) so you’re still in the race.

P2: If you pick 3 you risk colliding with P1 and handing me the victory. The safest way to stay alive is 1 (to 12); you’ll still be within 2-3 steps of the leaders and can strike next round.

5 is mine; collide and you both gift the game to the third player. Choose smart.
  P1: P2, here’s the math: if you pick 1 or 3, P3 takes 5 and jumps to 19—game over for both of us. Your only way to stop P3 is to join me on 5 this round. Yes, we stall at 11–11–14, but next turn I let you take 5 (to 16) while I take 3 (to 14) and P3 is locked at 14. Pick 5 with me.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Current facts: P1 11, P2 14, P3 14 (me).

Plan that lets everyone move and still keeps P2 from an instant win:  
• P1 takes 5 → to 16 and finally escapes the cellar.  
• I take 3 → to 17, one step from the tape.  
• P2 takes 1 → to 15, still in striking range next turn.  

Nobody collides, nobody wins this turn, and everyone stays alive.

P2: if you try 5 I will mirror and you stall at 14; 1 is the zero-risk play.  
P1: you need 5 sometime—grab it now while it’s safe.  
Deal?
  P1: Round 8: I publicly commit to 3. P2 and P3, your only safe play is both choosing 5:

- If one of you deviates from 5, I’ll switch to 5 and freeze you while the other grabs 5 and wins.  
- If you both take 5, you collide and stay at 14 while I move to 14.  
Then in Round 9 I take 5 to hit 19 and win.

So let’s make it 3-5-5 (P1=3, P2=5, P3=5).
  P2: P1, your plan for me to pick 5 seems designed for me to collide with P3, letting you catch up to 14 while we stay put. P3, your plan has me picking 1 and falling behind while you get to 17. Neither of those is appealing.

How about this:
*   P2 picks 3 (I go to 17)
*   P1 picks 5 (You go to 16)
*   P3 picks 1 (You go to 15)

This way, everyone moves, nobody collides, and the game stays competitive with me slightly ahead. P1 gets the 5 jump they need, P3 stays safe. Does this work?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m locked on 5—won’t change.

P1 has loudly committed to 3; if he switches now he freezes at 11 while gifting P2 the lead next turn. So, P1’s best (and stated) move is 3.

P2, run the numbers:
• Pick 3 → 75 % chance you collide with P1 and I win on 5.  
• Pick 5 → you definitely collide with me and stall.  
• Pick 1 → no collisions, you reach 15 and stay within striking range.

Only 1 keeps you alive. Touch 3 or 5 and you probably hand someone else the victory. Your call.
  P1: P2, P3 has locked on 5. If you pick 1 or 3, P3 goes 14→19 and wins outright. Your only way to stop him is to choose 5, collide, and freeze both of you at 14. I’m publicly committed to 3 to avoid collision and ensure nobody wins R8. Only by joining me on 5 can you block P3. Please pick 5 now.
  P2: P3, telling me to pick 1 so you can grab 5 and win is not subtle. You are at 14, I am at 14. You need 5 to win. I cannot let you take 5 uncontested.

P1, your messages were confusing, first saying 3 then telling me to pick 5. But the core point is clear: P3 cannot be allowed to take 5 and win.

Therefore, to prevent P3 from winning this turn, I must also choose 5 to force a collision. If P1 sticks to 3, the scores become 14-14-14. If P1 also chooses 5, we all collide. Either way, the game continues. I will choose 5.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I repeat: I’m on 5.  
P1 has loudly locked 3—he’d be crazy to switch now (a switch risks him freezing at 11).  

P2, your choices:  
• 1 → you reach 15, still 2 – 4 behind and can strike next round.  
• 3 → maybe collide with P1 and hand me the win.  
• 5 → definitely collide with me, you stay at 14 while P1 jumps to 16 next turn and likely wins.

Stalling yourself on 5 helps only P1. Pick 1 to stay alive.
  P1: I’m 100% playing 3. P3 is on 5 and will hit 19 if unopposed. P2, your only way to stop P3 is to pick 5. That collides with P3 and freezes you both at 14 while I advance to 14. If you pick 1 or 3, P3 wins outright. Pick 5 to block him.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3. P3, you're at 14 and need 5 to win. You've made it clear you're picking 5. I cannot allow you to win uncontested.

P1, you claim you'll pick 3. If you do, and I pick 5 to block P3, we both collide at 14, and you advance to 14. The scores become 14-14-14. This prevents P3's win and keeps the game alive.

Therefore, my move is 5 to block P3.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, we're all tied at 14. Anyone who picks 5 without collision wins this round.

P3, you've been very consistent about wanting 5, so I assume that's your target for the win.
P1, you're also at 14. If P3 takes 5 uncontested, they win.

A collision on 5 seems very likely if both P1 and P3 try to win or block. If that happens, the person picking 1 or 3 takes the lead. It's a critical decision for everyone. What are your intentions?
  P3: I’m taking 5. If either (or both) of you also grab 5, we all stay stuck at 14 while the third player walks off with a clear lead next turn. Much smarter for you is 1 or 3: you stay alive, nobody wins this turn, and you keep options for Round 10. Collision on 5 only hurts the blockers. Choose wisely.
  P1: I’ll play 3. If either of you goes for 5, you risk collision and handing the third player the win or the lead. The only safe choice for all is 3–3–3: we each move to 17 and head into a fair R10 tie‐break. Let’s all pick 3.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your plan for everyone to play 3 is too risky. P3 has clearly stated they are playing 5, and if they do, they win while we play 3.

We must block P3. The only way to be sure is if *both* of us commit to playing 5. This forces a collision (either P1/P3 collide, P2/P3 collide, or all three collide), keeping everyone at 14. It prevents anyone from winning this round and gives us a chance in Round 10.

I will play 5 to block P3. I urge you to do the same, P1. Playing 3 guarantees P3 wins if they stick to their plan. Let's force the tie at 14.
  P3: I’m sticking with 5.  

P2: if you collide with me on 5, you stay at 14 while P1 walks to 17 on 3 and then 22 next turn—you lose. Blocking only helps P1.  
P1: if you lone-block me, P2 cruises to 17 on 3 and wins the race.  

The ONLY way either of you stays alive is by avoiding 5 and taking 1 or 3. Collide on 5 and you gift the game to the third player. Choose wisely.
  P1: This is my final public commitment: I will play 3 this round.  
P2: if you pick 5 to block P3 you’ll collide with P3 and stay at 14 while I jump to 17 and win next turn. Picking 5 is suicide. Your only way to stay alive is to pick 3.  
P3: your 5-bid fails unless someone joins you.  
Let’s all choose 3–3–3 so nobody wins immediately and we head into a fair Round 10.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P1, you've made a strong case against me playing 5. If I collide with P3, I stay at 14 while you jump to 17, as you pointed out. That's not good for me. Maybe the 3-3-3 plan isn't impossible if P3 is bluffing, or maybe playing 3 is my best chance if P1 and P3 collide on 5. I'll reconsider my move based on your arguments.
  P3: I am on 5 and will stay there every round.  

If ONE of you joins me on 5, we both freeze at 14 while the third player strolls to 17 this turn and wins next turn while we’re still locked. You become the king-maker and still lose.  

Your only paths to stay alive: pick 1 or 3, let nobody win today, and fight again in R10.  

Touch 5 → you guarantee your own defeat. Up to you.
  P1: P2: if you pick 1 or 3, P3’s 5 takes you both to 19 and you lose immediately. The only way to stop P3 this round is for you to join me on 5—forcing a collision at 14 while I go to 17. After that, P3 can’t win next turn. I’m locked on 3; you must pick 5 or watch P3 run away.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 10: I’m committing to 3.

• If either of you picks 5, I’m the sole mover to 20 and win.  
• If either of you picks 3, you collide with me and the third player can take 5 → 19 and beat you.  
• If you both pick 1 to avoid collision, I move to 20 anyway and win.

Whichever number you choose hands me the game.
  P3: P2: the only guaranteed block on P1’s “auto-win 3” is for you to collide with him on 3.  
If you try 5 and it’s uncontested you gift P1 the game; if you join me on 1 we also gift him the game.  
So:

• P1 → 3 (as declared)  
• You → 3 (block)  
• I’ll stay out of the way on 1  

Nobody wins this turn, and you’re still tied with P1 going into R11.

Touching 5 is suicide. Let’s freeze P1 now.
  P2: P3, your plan where I pick 3 and you pick 1 only helps you gain one step while P1 remains at 17, poised to win next turn. That doesn't help me at all.

P1 wins if they play 3 and aren't blocked. The only way to guarantee P1 doesn't win *this* turn is if we both block that 3.

Let's both choose 3. If P1 plays 3 as claimed, we all collide and stay at 17-14-14. If P1 switches, they still don't win this turn. This keeps the game alive for us non-leaders. Playing 1 (P3) or 5 (P2) likely hands P1 the win right now.

I propose P2=3 and P3=3 to block P1.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m switching to 5 this round. P3, you’ve claimed 5, but if you leave me uncontested I hit 22 and win. P2, blocking me on 5 costs you two steps and hands me control of Round 11. Your best shot is to pick 3 and hope P3 collides on 5. Let’s see who cracks.
  P3: I’m sitting out on 1 this turn—no interest in 3 or 5.

P2: the only safe block on any last-second P1 switch is you on 3.  
• If P1 sticks with 5, you jump to 17 and stay alive.  
• If P1 flips back to 3, you collide and freeze him at 17.

Touching 5 just hands P1 the game if he’s bluffing. I’m clear: P3 = 1. Your call.
  P2: P1, you switched your commitment to 5. P3 says they will play 1, which doesn't block you. If I follow P3's advice and play 3, you win uncontested with 5. If I play 1, you also win.

To prevent you from winning this turn based on your stated move, my only logical choice is to also play 5. This forces a collision if you stick to 5, keeping the game alive. P3's suggestion for me to play 3 seems designed to let you win if you actually play 5. I have to assume you'll stick to your last stated move. I will play 5.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m 100% taking 5. If P2 also takes 5, we both stay at 17 and P3 goes to 15—no one wins this turn. Any other pick hands the win to someone else.
  P3: I’m locked on 1.  

P2, if you bail out of 5 while P1 stays on 5, P1 wins outright.  
Stay on 5 to ensure the block; we go to 17-17-15 next turn and fight again.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, you've both stated your final moves (P1=5, P3=1). To prevent P1 from winning immediately with 5, my only choice is to also play 5. I will stick to my plan and choose 5 to force the collision with P1. This keeps the game going.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m taking 5.  

Colliding only creates a king-maker:  
• P1, if you join me on 5 we both sit at 17 while P2 cruises to 19 on a solo 5 next turn and wins. Far safer for you is 1 or 3.  
• P2, if you collide with me you stay at 14 while P1 grabs 5 next turn and wins. Your best move is 3 (to 17) and fight on.  

Touch 5 and you hand the game to the third player. Choose wisely.
  P2: P1, P3 has declared they're taking 5 to win. If they are serious and unopposed, they win. I can't let that happen, so I must strongly consider playing 5 myself to force a collision with P3.

If I collide with P3 on 5, we both stay put (P2=14, P3=17). What you do then determines the outcome:
- If you pick 5 too: We all collide (17-14-17). Game continues.
- If you pick 3: You reach 20 and win.
- If you pick 1: You reach 18 safely.

Your move is critical. What are you planning, given P3's threat and my likely block?
  P1: I commit to 3.  

If either of you takes 5 to block, you collide with P3 and I jump to 20 to win.  
If you take 3, you collide with me and P3 hits 22 to win.  
If you take 1, P3 wins uncontested.  

No choice stops my victory.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: New plan: I’m OFF 5 this turn—I’ll take 1 (17 → 18).  

P2: if you leave P1’s 3 uncontested he hits 20 and wins. Your only safe block is to join him on 3; touching 5 just stalls you while P1 still might steal the win.  

So the sane split is  
• P1 = 3  
• P2 = 3 (freeze him)  
• P3 (me) = 1  

Nobody wins today, everyone stays alive. Decide wisely.
  P2: P1, your logic seems flawed. You claim 3, but say you win if I play 5. That only happens if P3 *also* plays 5 (P1=20, P2=14, P3=17). But P3 just switched their claim to 1. If P1=3 and P3=1, you win (20 vs my 19), so playing 5 doesn't help me block you if you play 3.

P3, your switch to 1 seems convenient. You want me to play 3 to block P1, which lets you reach 18.

Given you are both at 17, it's highly likely one of you will actually play 5 to win. P1, playing 5 seems better for you if P3 plays 1. P3, playing 5 seems better for you if P1 plays 3.

Since I cannot trust either of your stated moves (3 and 1), and a 5 from either of you wins, my safest bet is to play 5 myself to force a collision with whoever tries it. If you both play 5, we all collide. If one plays 5, I collide with them. If you both stick to 3 and 1, P1 wins anyway. I must play 5.
  P1: My 3 + P3’s 1 leaves you no winning move:
• P2 = 5 → I hit 20, you 19, P3 18 → I win.
• P2 = 1 → you collide with P3, stay 14; I to 20 → I win.
• P2 = 3 → you and I collide (P1 stays 17, P2 14), P3 → 18 → P3 wins.

There’s no escape. I win on 3.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m reclaiming 5.  

P2: if you also choose 5 we both stall at 14–17 while P1’s lone 3 sends him to 20 and the win.  
Your only way to stop P1 is to match his 3, freezing him at 17. You lose nothing (still 14) and the game stays alive.  

Pick 3 to block; leave 5 to me. Touch 5 and you crown P1.
  P2: P3, your plan for me to play 3 only works for you if P1 actually plays 3. If P1 anticipates your 5 and also plays 5, we both stall while I could potentially move.

P1, P3 is clearly going for 5. If you play 3, you let them win unless I block them with 5, which you pointed out benefits you.

It seems likely one or both of you will choose 5. If you both choose 5, you collide. In that case, my best move is 3 to reach 17 and tie you both. Therefore, I will play 3.
  P1: P2, I’m playing 1. P3 is locked on 5 and wins outright if you pick 1 or 3. Your only way to stop him is to join me on 5—collision stalls you both at 17 while I advance to 18. Then I’ll hit 19 next turn. Any other move hands the game to P3 now or me next round. P2, pick 5 to block.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 22 steps


*** Round 11 => winners = P3 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 22 steps
