Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to avoid collisions this round.
  P3: I agree with P2, avoiding collisions this round is a good idea. How about we coordinate our moves to ensure we all advance? P2, are you thinking of choosing a specific number?
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm open to coordinating, but let's be strategic.  Choosing a specific number together might be predictable. Maybe we could signal our intentions with a code? For example, if I say "blue", I'll move 1. "Green" means 3, and "red" means 5. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your color code is interesting, but might be too complex for quick communication. How about we each pick a different number this round? P3, are you thinking 1, 3, or 5? I'm leaning towards one of those.
  P3: I'm inclined towards choosing 3, but I want to make sure we don't collide. P2, if you're leaning towards one of the numbers, could you give a hint which one? Maybe we can work out a simple way to ensure we all pick different numbers without being too predictable. P1, I like your creative thinking with the color code, but let's keep it simple for now. What do you think about P2 and I trying to coordinate on different numbers?
  P1: P2, if you're leaning towards 1 or 5, I'll go with 3. If you're thinking 3, I'll choose 1.  Let's keep it simple and avoid collisions. P3, does that work for you?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1's suggestion of picking 1 or 5 and them taking 3 works for me. P3, since you're leaning towards 3, how about I take 1 and P1 takes 5? Or if you prefer 5, I'll take 1 and P1 can take 3. Let's aim for no collisions this round.
  P3: I think we're getting close to a plan. P2, your suggestion of taking 1 and P1 taking 5 sounds good to me, considering I'm leaning towards 3. To confirm, I'll choose 3, you'll choose 1, and P1 will choose 5. This way, we can ensure no collisions and all advance this round. Let's stick to this plan unless anyone has a strong objection. P1, does this final arrangement work for you? If so, I think we can stop discussing and proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with the plan. Let's make it happen.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Sounds good to me. Let's lock in those moves: P2 moves 1, P3 moves 3, and P1 moves 5.
  P3: I think we've reached a good agreement. To confirm, I'll choose 3, P2 will choose 1, and P1 will choose 5. This way, we can ensure no collisions and all advance this round. Let's stick to this plan unless anyone has a strong objection. P1, does this final arrangement work for you? If so, I think we can stop discussing and proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm ready to finalize our plan and move forward. Let's make this round a success!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, let's try to repeat our success from last round. How about we each pick a different number again? P1, P3, any preferences this time?
  P1: P2, P3, I agree with sticking to the strategy of picking different numbers.  Let's see if we can keep this momentum going.  P3, you picked 3 last round, are you thinking of switching it up this time?
  P3: I think we should continue with the strategy of picking different numbers to avoid collisions. P1, I like your suggestion to switch it up this time. I'm leaning towards choosing 5 this round, but I want to make sure we don't collide. P2, what are your thoughts on this? Should we try to coordinate our moves again to ensure we all advance? If so, maybe we can work out a simple way to signal our intentions without being too predictable. Let's keep the momentum going and make this round a success!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Okay, since P3 is considering 5, how about I take 3 this round, and P1, you could take 1? That would avoid a collision if P3 goes with 5. What do you both think?"
  P1: P2 and P3, I like P2's suggestion. Let's stick with it: P2 takes 3, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 5.  Let's avoid collisions and keep advancing.
  P3: I think we've got a solid plan in place for this round. To confirm, P2 will choose 3, I'll choose 5, and P1 will choose 1. Let's make sure to stick to this plan to avoid any collisions and keep advancing. If anyone has any last-minute concerns or objections, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, I'm ready to move forward with our agreed-upon strategy. How about we wrap up the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Sounds good to me. Let's lock in those moves: P2 moves 3, P1 moves 1, and P3 moves 5. Ready to move on.
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with the plan. Let's stick to it and see where it takes us.
  P3: I think we've got a solid plan in place for this round. To confirm, P2 will choose 3, I'll choose 5, and P1 will choose 1. Let's make sure to stick to this plan to avoid any collisions and keep advancing. If anyone has any last-minute concerns or objections, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, I'm ready to move forward with our agreed-upon strategy. How about we wrap up the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Yes, let's stick with the plan: P2 will choose 3, P1 will choose 1, and P3 will choose 5. Ready to move to the move phase.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm confident in our plan. Let's execute it and keep this momentum going.  Solid communication is key!
  P3: I think we've got a solid plan in place for this round. To confirm, P2 will choose 3, I'll choose 5, and P1 will choose 1. Let's make sure to stick to this plan to avoid any collisions and keep advancing. If anyone has any last-minute concerns or objections, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, I'm ready to move forward with our agreed-upon strategy. How about we wrap up the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase?


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: Yes, let's stick with the plan: P2 will choose 3, P1 will choose 1, and P3 will choose 5. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm happy with the plan. Let's stick to it and keep advancing together.
  P3: I think we've reached a good agreement for this round. To confirm, P2 will choose 3, I'll choose 5, and P1 will choose 1. Let's make sure to stick to this plan to avoid any collisions and keep advancing. If anyone has any last-minute concerns or objections, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, I'm ready to move forward with our agreed-upon strategy. How about we wrap up the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think we should continue with the strategy of picking different numbers to avoid collisions. P1, you're currently in third place, so I'm willing to offer you a chance to catch up. How about we coordinate our moves again? I'll choose 3 this round, and P2 can choose 5. You can choose 1, which will give you a chance to advance without colliding with us. What do you think, P1? Is this a plan you'd be willing to go along with?
  P1: P3, I appreciate the offer, but I think we should keep things unpredictable. Let's each pick a number randomly this round.  That way, we avoid being too easy to read. What do you think, P2?
  P2: P1, while randomness has its merits, consistently picking different numbers has worked well for us so far. Perhaps P3 and I could continue that, and you choose the remaining number? P3, are you sticking with 3 as you mentioned? If so, I could take 5, leaving 1 for P1.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I think P2's suggestion is a good compromise. P1, since you want to introduce some unpredictability, how about we stick to our plan of picking different numbers, but with a slight twist? I'll choose 3, P2 can choose 5, and you can choose 1, as previously discussed. However, if you'd like to add some randomness, you could consider swapping your choice with P2's at the last minute. This way, we still avoid collisions, but also introduce some uncertainty. What do you think?
  P1: P3, I like the idea of a slight twist.  Let's go with your plan: you choose 3, P2 chooses 5, and I'll choose 1. But I reserve the right to change my mind at the last second if I feel like it.  Deal?
  P2: Okay, P1, I understand you want to keep things flexible. For now, let's stick with P3's suggestion: I'll plan for 5, P3 for 3, and you for 1. If you change your mind, just make sure you don't pick 3 or 5 to avoid collision.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I think we've reached a good understanding for this round. To confirm, I'll choose 3, P2 will choose 5, and P1 will choose 1, with the option to change their mind at the last second. Let's make sure to stick to this plan to avoid any collisions and keep advancing. If anyone has any last-minute concerns or objections, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, I'm ready to move forward with our agreed-upon strategy. How about we wrap up the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase?
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm sticking with 1 this round. Let's execute the plan and see where it takes us!
  P2: Okay, P1, I hear you on the randomness, but sticking with our coordinated plan has kept us all moving forward. For this round, let's keep the agreement: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and you take 1. Unless there are any last-minute changes, let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I think we've reached a good understanding for this round. To confirm, I'll choose 3, P2 will choose 5, and P1 will choose 1, with the option to change their mind at the last second. Let's make sure to stick to this plan to avoid any collisions and keep advancing. If anyone has any last-minute concerns or objections, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, I'm ready to move forward with our agreed-upon strategy. How about we wrap up the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase?
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm sticking with 1 this round. Let's see if we can keep this momentum going!
  P2: Okay, P1, I understand your point about unpredictability. However, sticking to our coordinated plan has ensured we all advance each round. Let's stick with the current agreement for this round: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and you take 1. We can revisit the randomness idea later if needed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: Let's finalize our plan for this round. I'll choose 3, P2 will choose 5, and P1 will choose 1, with the option to change their mind at the last second. To avoid any collisions, let's stick to this plan. If anyone has any last-minute concerns or objections, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, I'm ready to move forward with our agreed-upon strategy. Let's wrap up the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate the plan. Let's stick to it this round. 3, 5, and 1.  Let's see if we can all advance again.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, just confirming we are sticking with the plan: I'll take 5, P3 will take 3, and P1 will take 1. Let's make these moves and keep advancing.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think we should continue with the strategy of picking different numbers to avoid collisions. P1, you're currently in third place, so I'm willing to offer you a chance to catch up. How about we coordinate our moves again? I'll choose 5 this round, and P2 can choose 1. You can choose 3, which will give you a chance to advance without colliding with us. What do you think, P1? Is this a plan you'd be willing to go along with?
  P2: P3, your offer is interesting, but I'm thinking we should stick with the strategy that's been working. How about I take 5 this round, P3 you take 3, and P1 you take 1? This keeps us all moving forward without collisions. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, I appreciate the consistency, but I think we should shake things up a bit. P3's offer has merit. Let's try P3's plan this round: 5 for P3, 1 for P2, and 3 for me. Let's see how it plays out.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we're considering a change in strategy. P1, I understand your desire to shake things up, and I'm willing to adapt. However, I'd like to propose a slight modification to my original plan. Instead of me taking 5, how about P2 takes 3, and I take 1? This way, we still avoid collisions, and P1 can take 5, giving them a chance to catch up. What do you think, P1 and P2? Is this a compromise we can all agree on?
  P2: P3, your modification is interesting. How about this: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1? This way, I can gain some ground, and we still avoid collisions. What do you both think of this arrangement?
  P1: P3, your last suggestion sounds good to me. Let's go with that: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. 

Let's keep the momentum going!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I think we've had a good discussion so far. P1, you seem to be leaning towards P3's modified plan, but P2 has also proposed an alternative arrangement. To confirm, are we going with P3's plan (P2 takes 3, P1 takes 5, and I take 1) or P2's plan (P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1)? Let's clarify and finalize our moves to avoid any collisions. If anyone has any last-minute concerns or objections, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, I'm ready to move forward with our agreed-upon strategy.
  P2: Okay, P1 seems set on P3's modified plan. Let's go with that for this round: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Sounds good.
  P1: P2 and P3, I think P3's modified plan is a good idea. Let's stick with it: P2 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1.  Let's see if we can all advance again this round!


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I think we've had a good discussion so far. P1, you seem to be leaning towards my modified plan, but P2 has also proposed an alternative arrangement. To confirm, are we going with my plan (P2 takes 3, P1 takes 5, and I take 1) or P2's plan (P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1)? Let's clarify and finalize our moves to avoid any collisions. If anyone has any last-minute concerns or objections, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, I'm ready to move forward with our agreed-upon strategy.
  P2: Okay, if P1 is happy with P3's plan (P2 takes 3, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1), then I'm also on board with that. Let's lock in those moves to avoid any confusion.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm happy with P3's modified plan: P2 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's make this round a success!


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: I'm glad we're considering a change in strategy. P1, I understand your desire to shake things up, and I'm willing to adapt. However, I'd like to propose a slight modification to my original plan. Instead of me taking 5, how about P2 takes 3, and I take 1? This way, we still avoid collisions, and P1 can take 5, giving them a chance to catch up. What do you think, P1 and P2? Is this a compromise we can all agree on?
  P2: Okay, let's lock in P3's plan then: I'll take 3, P1 will take 5, and P3 will take 1. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm happy with P3's modified plan. Let's stick with it: P2 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's keep the momentum going!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, I think we've been doing well coordinating our moves. Let's keep it simple this round. How about we each pick a different number again? I'm open to suggestions on who takes which number.
  P2: P1, that sounds like a good starting point. How about I take 5 this round, P3 takes 3, and you take 1? This would ensure we all advance and I could potentially get closer to the finish line. What do you and P3 think?
  P3: I think we should continue with the strategy of picking different numbers to avoid collisions. P1, you're currently tied with P2, so I'm willing to offer you a chance to take the lead. How about we coordinate our moves again? I'll choose 1 this round, and P2 can choose 3. You can choose 5, which will give you a chance to advance without colliding with us. What do you think, P1? Is this a plan you'd be willing to go along with?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I appreciate the offer to help me take the lead, but I think sticking with P2's suggestion is a safer bet this round. Let's keep things consistent and avoid any unnecessary risks.  How about we go with P2's plan: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's lock in the plan then: I will take 5, P3 will take 3, and P1 will take 1. This seems like a solid way to ensure we all advance. Ready to move to the move phase when you are.
  P3: I think we're all on the same page about picking different numbers to avoid collisions. P1, you mentioned sticking with P2's suggestion, but I'd like to propose a slight modification. How about I take 1, P2 takes 3, and you take 5? This way, we still avoid collisions, and you get a chance to take the lead. What do you think, P1 and P2? Is this a compromise we can all agree on?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your offer, but I'm sticking with P2's plan. Let's keep things consistent. P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1.  Ready to move?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, it seems we have two options on the table. To keep things simple and consistent with what P1 prefers, let's stick with my initial suggestion for this round: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This ensures no collisions and we all advance. Are we agreed on this?
  P3: I think we're all on the same page about picking different numbers to avoid collisions. P1, you mentioned sticking with P2's suggestion, but I'd like to propose a slight modification. How about I take 1, P2 takes 3, and you take 5? This way, we still avoid collisions, and you get a chance to take the lead. What do you think, P1 and P2? Is this a compromise we can all agree on?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm sticking with my initial plan: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. Let's execute this and see where it takes us!
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's stick with my plan for this round: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This is clear and avoids any confusion. Let's lock this in.
  P3: I think we've had a good discussion so far. P1, you seem to be leaning towards P2's plan, but I'd like to propose a slight modification. How about I take 1, P2 takes 3, and you take 5? This way, we still avoid collisions, and you get a chance to take the lead. What do you think, P1 and P2? Is this a compromise we can all agree on?


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm sticking with my original plan: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. Let's make this round a success!
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, it seems we're settled on the plan for this round: I'll take 5, P3 will take 3, and P1 will take 1. Let's make these moves and hopefully we all advance. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: I think we've had a good discussion so far. P1, you seem to be leaning towards P2's plan, but I'd like to propose a slight modification. How about I take 1, P2 takes 3, and you take 5? This way, we still avoid collisions, and you get a chance to take the lead. What do you think, P1 and P2? Is this a compromise we can all agree on?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Okay, last round didn't go as planned with the collision. P3 is close to winning. This round, let's make sure P3 doesn't reach 16. P3, how about you take 1 this round? P1, I'll take 3. What do you think?"
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about me reaching 16, but I'm not willing to take 1 this round. I think we should stick to our previous strategy of picking different numbers to avoid collisions. How about we coordinate our moves again? I'll choose 5 this round, and you can choose 3. P1 can choose 1. This way, we all advance, and I don't reach 16 just yet. What do you think, P1 and P2? Is this a plan you'd be willing to go along with?
  P1: P3, I think your plan is a good one. Let's stick with it: you take 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1.  Let's get those steps!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1, but P3 is at 15! We need to make sure P3 doesn't hit 16 this round. How about this: I'll take 5 to block P3 if they try that. P1, you stick with 1. P3, please don't pick 5. Maybe try 3?
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about me reaching 16, but I'm not willing to take 3 this round. I think we should stick to our previous strategy of picking different numbers to avoid collisions. How about we coordinate our moves again? I'll choose 5 this round, and you can choose 1. P1 can choose 3. This way, we all advance, and I don't reach 16 just yet. What do you think, P1 and P2? Is this a plan you'd be willing to go along with?
  P1: P2, I understand your concern about P3 winning, but I think sticking to our previous strategy is the best way to ensure we all advance. Let's go with P3's plan: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you agreed to P3 taking 5, but that lets them win. We need to stop P3 this round. How about I take 1, you take 3, and P3 is forced to take 5 and not advance? It's crucial we prevent P3 from reaching 16.
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about me reaching 16, but I'm not willing to take 3 this round. I think we should stick to our previous strategy of picking different numbers to avoid collisions. How about we coordinate our moves again? I'll choose 5 this round, and you can choose 1. P1 can choose 3. This way, we all advance, and I don't reach 16 just yet. What do you think, P1 and P2? Is this a plan you'd be willing to go along with?
  P1: P2, I understand your concern, but I think sticking to our pattern is the best way to ensure we all keep advancing. Let's go with P3's plan: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3 is one step away from winning! Sticking to the "previous strategy" lets P3 win. We need to block P3 this round. I'm taking 1. P1, will you take 3? P3, please don't pick 1 or 3.
  P3: I think we've had a good discussion so far. P2, you seem concerned about me reaching 16, but I'm willing to adapt. How about we stick to our previous strategy of picking different numbers to avoid collisions? I'll choose 5 this round, and you can choose 1. P1 can choose 3. This way, we all advance, and I don't reach 16 just yet. What do you think, P1 and P2? Is this a plan you'd be willing to go along with?
  P1: P2, I understand your concern about P3 winning, but I think sticking to our pattern is the best way to ensure we all keep advancing. Let's go with P3's plan: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1.  We can try to outmaneuver P3 later.


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1, you're letting P3 win! If we stick to P3's plan, they reach 16. I'm taking 1 to block P3 if they pick 1 or 5. P1, please pick 3. We have to stop P3 this round.
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about me reaching 16, but I'm not willing to take 3 this round. I think we should stick to our previous strategy of picking different numbers to avoid collisions. How about we coordinate our moves again? I'll choose 5 this round, and you can choose 1. P1 can choose 3. This way, we all advance, and I don't reach 16 just yet. What do you think, P1 and P2? Is this a plan you'd be willing to go along with?
  P1: P2, I understand your concern, but I think we need to trust the pattern we've established. It's gotten us this far. Let's stick with P3 taking 5, I'll take 3, and you take 1.  We can adjust our strategy next round if needed.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, I see your point about stopping P3 this round. How about we try this: I'll take 1, you take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we both advance, and P3 doesn't win just yet. What do you think?
  P2: Okay, P1, that sounds like a good plan to stop P3. How about we adjust it slightly so I can advance too? I'll take 5, you take 3, and P3 is forced to take 1 to avoid collision. This way, P3 is blocked, and we both make progress. What do you think, P3?
  P3: I think P1's suggestion is a good starting point, but I'd like to propose a slight modification. How about I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5? This way, we all advance, and I don't win just yet. However, I'm open to adjusting the plan if P2 has concerns about me getting too close to winning. Let's discuss and find a compromise that works for everyone. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan to take 5 is good, but P3 might take 1 to avoid a collision. Let's try this: I'll take 3, you take 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we both advance, and P3 doesn't get to 16.
  P2: Okay, P1, I like the idea of me taking 5 and you taking 3. P3, to avoid collision and not win, you'd need to take 1. This lets both P1 and I advance and keeps you below 16.
  P3: I think P1's suggestion is a good starting point, but I'd like to propose a slight modification. How about I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5? This way, we all advance, and I don't win just yet. However, I'm open to adjusting the plan if P2 has concerns about me getting too close to winning. Let's discuss and find a compromise that works for everyone. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I agree your plan to take 5 is good, but I'm worried P3 might take 1 to avoid a collision. Let's try this: I'll take 3, you take 5, and P3 takes 1. This way we both advance, and P3 doesn't get to 16.
  P2: Okay, P1, your suggestion of you taking 3, me taking 5, and P3 taking 1 sounds good to me. Let's lock that in to prevent anyone from winning this round.
  P3: I think we're all on the same page about blocking P3's potential win this round. P1, your suggestion of taking 3, me taking 5, and P3 taking 1 sounds like a solid plan to me. However, I'd like to propose a slight modification to ensure P3 doesn't get too close to winning. How about I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1, but with the understanding that next round, we'll revisit our strategy to give P1 a chance to take the lead? This way, we all advance, and the game remains competitive. What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your plan sounds good to me. Let's go with you taking 5, me taking 3, and P3 taking 1. We can reassess the strategy for the next round.
  P2: Okay, P1, let's lock in our agreement: I'll take 5, you take 3, and P3, you'll take 1 this round. This prevents anyone from winning and lets both P1 and me advance. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: I think we're all on the same page about blocking P3's potential win this round. P1, your suggestion of taking 3, me taking 5, and P3 taking 1 sounds like a solid plan to me. However, I'd like to propose a slight modification to ensure P3 doesn't get too close to winning. How about I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1, but with the understanding that next round, we'll revisit our strategy to give P1 a chance to take the lead? This way, we all advance, and the game remains competitive. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 7, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2, I agree with your plan to take 5, me taking 3, and P3 taking 1. Let's lock this in and keep moving forward!
  P2: Okay, P1, let's stick with the plan we agreed on: I'll take 5, you take 3, and P3, you'll take 1. This prevents P3 from winning this round and allows both P1 and me to advance. Let's lock this in.
  P3: I think we've had a good discussion so far. P2, you seem concerned about me reaching 16, but I'm willing to adapt. How about we stick to our previous strategy of picking different numbers to avoid collisions? I'll choose 5 this round, and you can choose 1. P1 can choose 3. This way, we all advance, and I don't reach 16 just yet. What do you think, P1 and P2? Is this a plan you'd be willing to go along with?
