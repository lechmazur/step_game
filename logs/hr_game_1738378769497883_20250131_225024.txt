Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's start by coordinating a bit. I suggest we all pick different numbers this round to ensure someone advances. How about P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5? This way, we can see how this strategy works and adjust as needed. What do you think?
  P1: P2, your suggestion makes sense for this round, but remember, ultimately, only one of us can win. Let's try your plan this time, but keep in mind that alliances can shift quickly. P3, are you on board with this for now?
  P3: I appreciate the coordination, but I’m cautious. I’m inclined to try a moderate move this round. However, let’s keep our options flexible—everyone’s move is private, after all. I’ll adjust based on what I see.

  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: It seems our coordination worked well in the first round, but let's not get too comfortable. I suggest we keep things dynamic. How about this: P1, you pick 3 this round; P3, you pick 1; and I'll take 5 again. This way, we can keep the momentum going and avoid predictable patterns. What do you think?
  P3: I appreciate your suggestion, but I’m leaning toward keeping my strategy fluid this round. I’m not ready to lock into a preset number—flexibility might be key as we approach 20. Let’s keep our options open and adjust based on how things evolve.
  P1: P2, I see your point about staying dynamic, but I'm not entirely convinced about sticking to a rigid plan. P3, your approach of flexibility resonates with me. As we get closer to 20, unpredictability might be more beneficial. Let's keep our strategies adaptable and see how the game unfolds. Remember, the goal is to win, so let's stay sharp.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m staying flexible this round—coordination sounds tempting, but predictability could backfire. I’ll adjust my move based on how things unfold, so I’m hesitant to lock into a pattern. Let’s each play smart and avoid clashing too much.
  P1: P3, I agree with your approach to staying flexible. Predictability can be risky, and we should adapt based on the current situation. P2, I see your strategy of picking 5 consistently, but remember, if we both pick 5, neither of us advances. Let's keep our options open and avoid clashing. Ultimately, only one can win, so let's focus on making smart moves each round.
  P2: I understand the need for flexibility, but let's not lose sight of the goal. I suggest we try a coordinated move this round to ensure someone advances. How about P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5? This way, we can keep the momentum and avoid clashing. What do you think?

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, it seems like sticking with flexibility has been working for you, and I respect that. P2, your consistent strategy is clear, but let's not forget the risk of clashing. We all need to adapt to win. This round, I propose we each choose unpredictably to keep each other guessing. Remember, the goal is to avoid direct clashes and advance strategically. Let’s make smart, independent choices and see how this round plays out.
  P3: I'm sticking with flexibility this round. I won’t fully commit to a specific number just yet. P1, P2, I'm all for avoiding direct clashes—predictability can be dangerous. Let’s try to make moves that give us room to adapt as the game nears finish.
  P2: I agree with the need for flexibility, but let's also consider the current positions. We're all relatively close, so a coordinated move could be beneficial. How about this: P1, you pick 3; P3, you pick 1; and I'll pick 5. This way, we can ensure someone advances and avoid clashing. What do you think? Let's make a smart move this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I see your point about coordination, but given the last two rounds, clashing seems risky. P3, your flexibility is working well. Maybe we should all choose unpredictably this time to avoid direct clashes. Remember, the goal is to advance without colliding, so let's each think strategically and independently. Ultimately, we each want to win, so let's keep our strategies sharp and adaptable.
  P3: Staying flexible remains my focus. With everyone edging closer to 20, each step matters. I'm watching our positions and will aim for a measured advance—avoiding unnecessary clashes. No commitments from me yet, but expect a calculated, adaptive move.
  P2: I understand the importance of flexibility, but let's not forget the need to advance. This round, I suggest a slight variation: P1, you pick 1; P3, you pick 3; and I'll pick 5. This way, we can ensure someone advances and avoid direct clashes. Let's make a smart, coordinated move this round to keep the momentum going. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I get your point about coordination, but after the last rounds, I'm wary of clashing again. P3, your flexible approach is smart given our close scores. Let's each choose unpredictably this time to avoid direct clashes and advance strategically. Remember, the goal is to win, so let's keep our strategies sharp and adaptable.
  P3: I appreciate the suggestions, but with our scores so close, locking in a pattern feels too risky. I worry that predictable moves might lead to more collisions—and none of us wants to stall our progress when every step counts. I’m keeping a flexible strategy while watching our patterns carefully. Let’s try to avoid repeating the same numbers if it might hurt someone’s advance.
  P2: I understand the need for flexibility and avoiding clashes. Given our close positions, let's each make a smart, independent move this round. I'll pick 3, hoping to advance without colliding. P1, P3, feel free to choose your moves based on what you think is best for your strategy. Let's keep it unpredictable and see how this round plays out. Stay sharp and focus on advancing.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, with our scores so close, coordination might be risky, but so is complete unpredictability. Let's try a hybrid approach: I'll pick 5 this round, aiming for a significant advance. P1, consider picking 1, and P3, you could pick 3. This way, we can ensure someone advances without clashing. What do you think? Let's make a smart, calculated move.
  P3: I’m leaning towards a cautious but firm advance this round—flexibility is key to avoid collisions. I won’t lock in a number publicly, but I urge you both to consider that predictable choices could backfire when every step counts. Let’s try to prevent mutual stalling and keep our moves diverse.
  P1: P2, I see your point about a hybrid approach. However, with our scores so close, being too predictable might lead to a stall. P3, your caution makes sense. Let’s each aim for a strategic move that minimizes collision risk. Remember, advancing without clashing is key. I'll stay flexible and make a decision based on the current dynamics. Let's keep our strategies adaptable and focused on winning.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:

  P3: I’m leaning toward breaking the cycle of repeated proposals. Our scores are too close to risk predictable collisions. I’m planning a cautious, independent move to advance safely this round. Let’s avoid locking into patterns—keeping our moves fluid could make the difference.
  P1: P2, P3, given our close scores, I suggest we each make independent, unpredictable moves to minimize collision risk.
