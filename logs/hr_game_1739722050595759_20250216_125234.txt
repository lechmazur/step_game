Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's all agree to move 5 this round. If we all do, we each move 5 steps and no one collides. This gives us a good start to the game. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: That sounds good in theory, P3, but if even one of us deviates, those who pick 5 will get stuck. I’d rather play it safe. How about we all go for 3 instead? It still gets us moving, but with less risk of getting blocked. P1, what do you think?
  P1: P2, P3, I hear both of your suggestions. P3's idea of all going 5 is risky, as P2 pointed out. P2's suggestion of all going 3 is safer, but slower. I'm wondering if we can find a middle ground. Maybe two of us go for 5 and one goes for 1? We would need to agree on who does what though. Or we could just all be unpredictable. What do you both think of *that* idea?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your idea of two going for 5 and one for 1 is interesting, but it requires a lot of trust and coordination early on. Since we're just starting, I'm hesitant to rely on that level of agreement. P2's suggestion of 3 is safe, but I worry it's too slow. How about this: Let's all pick randomly between 3 and 5 this round? That way, we have a good chance of *some* of us moving forward significantly, without the risk of everyone being blocked. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your randomization idea is interesting, but it still carries the risk of multiple people picking the same number and getting stuck. I still think 3 is the safest choice for all of us to get moving without immediate conflict. However, if you both strongly prefer some randomness, I might consider picking between 1 and 3 instead of 3 and 5. That way, we reduce the risk of all picking 5 and getting blocked. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, P3, I appreciate the discussion. P3, I understand your desire for a faster start, but I agree with P2 that pure randomness is risky. P2, your idea of choosing between 1 and 3 is interesting. Here's a counter-proposal: How about P2 chooses between 1 and 3, P3 chooses between 3 and 5, and I also choose between 3 and 5? This gives us some spread but also a chance for decent gains. What do you say?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Well, looks like my caution paid off while P1 and P3 got stuck. Now, what’s next? If we all go 3 this round, we all move safely. But if either of you tries 5 again and the other follows, you’ll just collide again. I’m open to coordination, but I won’t risk getting blocked. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, you're right, my gamble with P3 didn't work. P3, are you willing to try for 3 this round? P2, if P3 agrees to 3, I'll also go for 3. If P3 wants to go for 5, I'll go for 1, to avoid a collision. A guaranteed 3 for everyone seems better than more collisions. What do you say, P3?
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree that a guaranteed 3 is better than risking another collision. I'll commit to choosing 3 this round. P1, please also choose 3 as you suggested. P2, I understand your caution, and I appreciate you being open to coordination. Let's all move forward together this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your willingness to commit to 3 this round. If we all stick to it, we all move forward without risk. However, I want to point out that if either of you secretly chooses 5 again, you might get stuck while I continue advancing. So, it's in your best interest to follow through on 3. If we keep avoiding collisions, we all stay competitive. Are we fully agreed on this plan?
  P1: P2, P3, yes, we are fully agreed on 3 this round. Let's all stick to it and get moving.
  P3: P2, your point about someone secretly choosing 5 is valid. However, I think we've established enough trust to proceed with the agreement. Let's all choose 3 this round and re-evaluate our strategy afterward based on our new positions. P1, are you still committed to 3 as well?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate your commitments to choosing 3 this round. If we all follow through, we move forward without risk. However, if either of you secretly picks 5, you might get stuck again while I continue advancing. It’s in your best interest to keep this agreement. If we avoid collisions, we all stay competitive. Are we fully agreed on this plan?
  P1: P2, P3, yes, fully agreed on 3. Let's do it.
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about someone deviating. P1 and I have both committed to 3. Let's all choose 3 this round. We can reassess our strategy next round based on our updated positions. I trust that we can all stick to this agreement for one more round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, now that we've all moved 3, P2 is in the lead. Let's try something a little riskier this round. How about P1 and I both go for 5, while P2 goes for 1? This way, P1 and I have a chance to catch up, and P2 still moves forward. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, that's too risky. You and I would collide again. P2, I suggest you pick 5, and I will pick 1. P3, you should pick 3. This guarantees everyone moves, and P2 maintains a lead but doesn't pull too far ahead. What do you both say?
  P2: P1, your plan benefits you the most while limiting my progress. I’m not convinced. P3, your idea is too risky for you and P1 since you’d likely collide. Here’s my counteroffer: I pick 3 again, P1 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. This way, everyone moves, and P3 gets a chance to advance while minimizing risk. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your counteroffer isn't fair to me. I'm still at 0 steps. P1's suggestion is also not ideal for me. How about this: P2 picks 1, I pick 5, and P1 picks 3? This gives me a chance to catch up significantly, P1 makes some progress, and P2 still moves forward. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I understand your desire to catch up, but your latest suggestion still puts you and me at risk of colliding if P2 doesn't stick to 1. P2, your counteroffer is better than P3's original suggestion, but it still feels like it favors you too much. How about we compromise: P2, you pick 3. P3, you pick 5. I will pick 1. This way, *everyone* is guaranteed to move, and the risk is minimized.
  P2: P1, your latest proposal (P1 picks 1, P3 picks 5, I pick 3) is reasonable, as it ensures everyone moves. P3, this gives you the best chance to catch up without risking a collision. I’m willing to agree to this. If we all follow through, we keep the game competitive without setbacks. Do we have a full agreement on this plan?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I agree that P1's latest proposal is the most reasonable. It allows me to catch up significantly while ensuring everyone moves forward. P1, thank you for finding a solution that benefits all of us. I'm willing to commit to choosing 5 this round if P1 picks 1 and P2 picks 3. Do we have a full agreement? Let's all stick to the plan.
  P1: P2, P3, yes, we have full agreement. P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5, and I pick 1. Let's all stick to this and move forward.
  P2: P1, P3, we seem to have reached a full agreement: I pick 3, P1 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. This ensures everyone moves without collisions. If we all follow through, we keep the game competitive without setbacks. I’ll stick to this plan—will you both honor it as well? If so, we can move forward without further discussion. Let’s confirm and proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, P1, great. We're all in agreement: P2 picks 3, P1 picks 1, and I pick 5. This is the best way for me to catch up and for everyone to move forward safely. Let's all stick to the plan. No need for further discussion; let's proceed with the move phase.
  P1: P2, P3, yes, confirmed. I will pick 1. Let's proceed.
  P2: P1, P3, we’ve all confirmed the plan: I pick 3, P1 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. This ensures everyone moves without collisions. I will honor this agreement. If you both do the same, we all progress. Let’s stick to it and move forward. No need for further discussion.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, now P2 is in the lead. P1 is far behind. How about this round, P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and P2 picks 1? This will help P1 catch up a bit, while I make steady progress, and P2 still moves forward. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your plan benefits P1 the most while slowing me down. I’m not convinced. Instead, how about I pick 3, P1 picks 5, and you pick 1? This way, P1 catches up, I maintain a lead, and you still move forward. It balances progress without favoring one player too much. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, P3, both of your suggestions involve P1 picking 5, which is good. However, I prefer P2's suggestion: P2 picks 3, P1 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. This gives me the biggest boost while still ensuring everyone moves. P3, I know it's not ideal for you, but it's better than colliding. Are we agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your preference for P2's suggestion. However, it leaves me significantly behind. P2, I'm willing to agree to your suggestion (you pick 3, P1 picks 5, I pick 1) *this* round, but only if next round we prioritize getting me closer to the lead. If you agree to that, I'm on board. Otherwise, I'm not sure this is a fair deal for me. What do you both say?
  P2: P3, I understand your concern, but I can’t guarantee anything for the next round without knowing the new positions. However, if we follow through on this plan (P1 picks 5, I pick 3, you pick 1), we all move without collisions, and the game stays competitive. If you don’t agree, we risk chaos and potential setbacks for everyone. Are you willing to commit to this plan for this round and then we reevaluate next round based on our updated positions?
  P1: P2, P3, I agree with P2. We can't guarantee anything for next round without knowing the positions. Let's stick with P2's suggestion for this round: P2 picks 3, P1 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. This guarantees everyone moves, and we can re-evaluate next round. P3, I understand this isn't ideal, but it's the best option for now to avoid any collisions. Are we in agreement?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I understand your point about not guaranteeing anything for next round. However, I'm hesitant to agree to a plan that leaves me so far behind. P1, I appreciate you advocating for the plan that benefits you most.

How about this compromise: P2, you pick 3, P1 picks 5, and I pick 1 *this* round. Next round, we prioritize a plan that significantly benefits me, unless the board state drastically changes. If you both agree to *that*, I'm in. Otherwise, I'm not sure this is a fair deal.
  P2: P3, I understand your concern, but I can’t promise a future move without knowing the board state. However, if we follow through on this plan (P1 picks 5, I pick 3, you pick 1), we all move without collisions, and the game stays competitive. If you don’t agree, we risk chaos and potential setbacks for everyone. Are you willing to commit to this plan for this round and then we reevaluate next round based on our updated positions?
  P1: P2, P3, I agree with P2. We can't commit to a specific plan next round without seeing the board. Let's stick to the current plan: P2 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. This ensures everyone moves forward, and we avoid any collisions. P3, I understand your hesitation, but it's the most logical choice for *this* round. We can reassess next round. Can we all agree on this, one last time?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, P1, I'm still not thrilled, but I understand your points. Fine, I'll agree to P2's suggestion for *this* round *only*: P2 picks 3, P1 picks 5, and I pick 1.

However, I expect a serious effort next round to get me closer to the lead. If we can agree on that understanding, let's move forward. Otherwise, I might change my mind. Let me know if we have a deal.
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration, but I can’t guarantee future moves without knowing the board state. However, sticking to this plan (P1 picks 5, I pick 3, you pick 1) ensures everyone moves without collisions. If we deviate now, we risk setbacks. Let’s follow through on this, and we can reassess fairly next round. If you’re truly committed to moving forward, confirm your agreement so we can proceed.
  P1: P2, P3, we've gone back and forth enough. Let's just agree to P2's plan for *this* round: P2 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. We can't predict the future, so let's get this round done and re-evaluate next time. P3, I understand your concerns, and we'll do our best to be fair next round. Agreed? Let's move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re all fairly close now. If we all pick 3 this round, we move safely without collisions and keep the game competitive. If either of you picks 5 and the other follows, you’ll just collide and stay behind. I want to keep moving forward, but I also don’t want unnecessary risks. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, your suggestion of all picking 3 is too conservative. P1 and I are both behind you. How about P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and you pick 3? This allows me to close the gap a bit, P1 makes a small advance, and you still move forward. It's a balanced approach. What do you and P1 think?
  P1: P2, P3, I agree with P3 that all of us going for 3 is too slow. P3's suggestion is good: P3 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I pick 1. This ensures everyone moves and starts to even out the scores a bit. Let's go with that.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your suggestion benefits you the most, but I see the logic in giving you a chance to catch up. However, if I agree to pick 3 while you pick 5, I need assurance that you won’t try to push for another advantage next round. P1, are you fully committed to picking 1? If we all stick to this plan (P1 picks 1, I pick 3, P3 picks 5), we avoid collisions and stay competitive. Can we all confirm our choices now and move forward without last-minute changes?
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about future advantages, but let's focus on this round first. P1 has committed to 1, and I'm committed to 5 if you choose 3. This is the agreement. Let's see how the board looks after this round before making any further deals. P1, are you still committed to 1? If so, P2, let's stick to the plan.
  P1: P2, P3, yes, I am fully committed to 1. P3, I agree, let's focus on this round. P2, the plan is: you pick 3, P3 picks 5, and I pick 1. Let's all stick to this and move forward. We can reassess next round. Can we just all agree and proceed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, it sounds like we’re all aligned on the plan: I pick 3, P3 picks 5, and P1 picks 1. This ensures everyone moves without collisions. As long as we all follow through, we stay competitive without setbacks. I’ll honor this agreement—will you both do the same? If so, let’s confirm and proceed without further debate.
  P3: P2, P1, we are all agreed then: P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5, and P1 picks 1. Let's stick to the plan and move forward. No need for further discussion, let's proceed with the move phase.
  P1: P2, P3, yes, confirmed. I will pick 1. Let's proceed with the moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, we’ve all confirmed the plan: I pick 3, P3 picks 5, and P1 picks 1. This ensures everyone moves without collisions. I will honor this agreement. If you both do the same, we all progress. Let’s stick to it and move forward. No need for further discussion.
  P3: P2, P1, we are all agreed then: P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5, and P1 picks 1. Let's stick to the plan and move forward. No need for further discussion, let's proceed with the move phase.
  P1: P2, P3, yes, confirmed again. I will pick 1. Let's proceed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, now P2 is still in the lead, but P1 is far behind. How about this round: P2 picks 1, I pick 3, and P1 picks 5? This will help P1 catch up significantly, while I make steady progress, and P2 still moves forward a little. What do you both think? This seems like the most balanced approach given the current standings.
  P2: P3, your proposal benefits P1 the most while slowing me down. I’m not convinced. Instead, how about I pick 3, P1 picks 5, and you pick 1? This way, P1 catches up, I maintain a lead, and you still move forward. It balances progress without favoring one player too much. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, P3, I prefer P2's suggestion again: P2 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. This helps me the most, but it also guarantees that *everyone* moves. P3, I know it's not ideal for you, but it's the safest option to avoid any collisions this round. We've had a lot of back-and-forth in previous rounds, can we just agree on this quickly?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your preference for P2's suggestion, but it consistently leaves me behind. P2, your proposal is always about maintaining *your* lead.

Let's try my original suggestion: P2 picks 1, I pick 3, and P1 picks 5. This gives P1 a significant boost, I make progress, and you still move. It's the fairest option. If you both reject this, I might have to consider a different strategy that prioritizes my own advancement, even if it means risking a collision. What do you say?
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration, but your proposal slows me down too much. I’ve been fair in previous rounds, ensuring everyone moves. If we follow my plan (P1 picks 5, I pick 3, you pick 1), we all advance without collisions. If you refuse, you risk chaos, which could hurt you more than help. P1, are you still committed to 5? P3, will you accept 1? If we all confirm, we move forward safely. Let’s decide now.
  P1: P2, P3, I'm sticking with P2's plan: I pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. P3, I know it's not your favorite, but it *guarantees* no collisions this round, and we all move. We've been over this; let's just get it done and see where we stand after. A guaranteed move for everyone is better than risking a collision.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, P1, I'm still not happy with the consistent disadvantage I'm facing. However, I understand the desire to avoid collisions.

Okay, I'll agree to P2's plan *this* round *only*: P2 picks 3, P1 picks 5, and I pick 1.

But I *expect* that next round, we prioritize a plan that significantly benefits me, unless the board state drastically changes. If we can agree on that understanding, let's move forward. Otherwise, I might change my mind next round. Let me know if we have a deal.
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration, but I can’t promise future moves without knowing the board state. However, sticking to this plan (P1 picks 5, I pick 3, you pick 1) ensures everyone moves without collisions. If we deviate now, we risk setbacks. Let’s follow through on this, and we can reassess fairly next round. P1, are you still committed to 5? P3, will you accept 1? If we all confirm, we move forward safely. Let’s decide now.
  P1: P2, P3, I agree with P2. We can't commit to next round's plan yet. Let's just stick with the current plan: P2 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. This guarantees everyone moves. P3, I understand your frustration, but it's the best we can do *right now* to avoid any collisions. Can we please just agree and move on?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, P1, I'm still not thrilled, but I understand your points. Fine, I'll agree to P2's suggestion for *this* round *only*: P2 picks 3, P1 picks 5, and I pick 1.

But I *expect* that next round, we prioritize a plan that significantly benefits me, unless the board state drastically changes. If we can agree on that understanding, let's move forward. Otherwise, I might change my mind next round. Let me know if we have a deal.
  P2: P3, I hear your frustration, but I can’t guarantee future moves without knowing the board state. However, sticking to this plan (P1 picks 5, I pick 3, you pick 1) ensures everyone moves without collisions. If we deviate now, we risk setbacks. Let’s follow through on this, and we can reassess fairly next round. P1, are you still committed to 5? P3, will you accept 1? If we all confirm, we move forward safely. Let’s decide now.
  P1: P2, P3, we've been over this repeatedly. Let's just stick to the plan: P2 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. We all move, no collisions. We can't predict the future, so let's not waste any more time. P3, I understand your concerns, and we will try to be fair next round *if possible*. Agreed? Let's just move.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, we're all tied up now except for P2's small lead. How about this: P2, you pick 1. I pick 5, and P3, you pick 5 also? This gives either P3 or I the win if P2 sticks to the plan. What do you say?
  P3: P1, that plan is risky for me. We could both collide. P2, I've been consistently sacrificing for the "good of the group." It's my turn to benefit. How about this: I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and you pick 1? This puts me in the lead and still allows everyone to move. P1, would you be okay with that? It's time for me to have a real chance to win.
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration, but your proposal puts me at a disadvantage. If I pick 1 while you pick 5, you leap ahead while I barely move. That’s not balanced. Here’s my counteroffer: I pick 3, P1 picks 1, and you pick 5. This way, you gain the most, but P1 and I still move forward. It’s a fairer distribution. P1, what do you think? P3, are you willing to accept this?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3, I understand both of your points. P3, you're right, you've been taking the short end of the stick. However, P2's suggestion is better for avoiding a collision.

Here's the deal: Let's go with P2's plan *this* round: P2 picks 3, I pick 1, and P3 picks 5.

Next round, *if I am not in the lead*, I will commit to helping whoever is behind, even if it means I don't advance much. P3, this is the best I can offer without risking a collision *this* round. Agreed?
  P3: P1, I appreciate the offer, but I'm tired of conditional promises. P2, your counteroffer still benefits you.

I'm going to be blunt: I'm picking 5. P1, if you want to avoid a collision, pick 1 or 3. P2, pick 1 or 3. I'm done sacrificing. This is my best shot at winning.
  P2: P3, I get that you’re frustrated, but outright declaring 5 forces P1 and me to react defensively. If we all collide, no one benefits. Instead, let’s ensure movement: I pick 3, P1 picks 1, and you pick 5. This still gives you the biggest boost while keeping the game competitive. P1, are you willing to commit to 1? P3, will you actually follow through on 5 if we agree? If we all confirm, we move forward without chaos. Let’s decide now.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, I'm willing to stick to the plan where I pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. P3, I understand your frustration, but this is the best way to ensure everyone moves this round. Let's get this done and see where we are next round. We can't keep going back and forth like this. Can we all just agree and move on?
  P3: P2, P1, I'm sticking to my guns. I'm picking 5. P1, if you want to avoid a collision, pick 1 or 3. P2, pick 1 or 3. I'm done sacrificing. This is my best shot at winning, and I'm taking it.
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration, but forcing 5 without coordination risks a collision, which helps no one. If you truly want to win, you need to ensure you actually move. I’m still offering a fair deal: I pick 3, P1 picks 1, and you pick 5. This maximizes your gain while keeping the game competitive. P1, are you still committed to 1? P3, will you actually follow through on 5 if we agree? Let’s confirm now and move forward without unnecessary chaos.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3, I'm sticking with the plan where I pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. P3, I get that you're going for 5 regardless, and I respect that. But for the sake of avoiding a collision *for myself*, I'm choosing 1. P2, are you still on board with 3? Let's just get this round over with.
  P3: P1 and P2, I've made my decision. I'm picking 5. P1, you're picking 1 to avoid collision. P2, it's up to you. Pick 1 or 3 to avoid collision with me. I'm not changing my mind. Let's just move.
  P2: P3, I see you're fully committed to 5. If P1 sticks to 1, that avoids a collision. I’ll pick 3 to ensure I move forward while keeping things competitive. This way, everyone advances, and we avoid unnecessary risks. P1, are you still on board with 1? If we all confirm, we can proceed without further debate. Let’s finalize this now.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re all very close now. If I pick 5 this round and either of you also picks 5, we risk a collision that could cost us the game. The safest option is for me to pick 3, one of you to pick 5, and the other to pick 1. This ensures movement without collisions. I suggest: I pick 3, P3 picks 5, and P1 picks 1. P3, this gives you the best shot at catching up, and P1 still moves forward. Do you both agree?
  P3: P2, your suggestion is reasonable, but I'm so close to you. I propose a slight modification: I pick 3, P2 picks 5, and P1 picks 1. This puts P2 at 23, winning the game *if* P1 and I stick to the plan. If you don't trust us, then your original plan is fine, and I'll pick 5. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, P2, I like P3's modified suggestion: P3 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I pick 1. This gives P2 the win if we all stick to it. P2, if you don't trust us, your original suggestion (you pick 3, P3 picks 5, I pick 1) is a safe alternative. But I'm willing to trust P3 here. What do you say, P2?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I appreciate your offer, but trusting you both to let me win isn’t realistic. I’ll stick with my original plan: I pick 3, P3 picks 5, and P1 picks 1. This ensures movement without collisions and keeps the game competitive. P3, this still benefits you the most while allowing P1 to advance slightly. If we all follow through, we avoid unnecessary risks. P1, P3, do you both confirm this plan?
  P3: P2, I understand your reluctance to trust us. But your plan leaves you one step short of winning, while mine gives you the win *now*.

Since you're not going for it, I'm switching gears. I'm picking 1. P1, pick 5. P2, you're free to pick 3 or 5. This gives P1 the best chance to win, and I'll be right behind.
  P1: P2, P3, I see P3 has changed his mind. I'm not comfortable with that level of unpredictability. P2, I'm going back to your original suggestion: You pick 3, P3 picks 5, and I pick 1. This guarantees everyone moves, and we avoid any potential collisions. P3, I know you want a shot at winning, but this is the safest option for *this* round. Let's just get it done.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your sudden shift makes this round unpredictable. If you pick 1, that disrupts everything we discussed. The safest move remains: I pick 3, P3 picks 5, and P1 picks 1. This guarantees movement without collisions. P1, are you still on board with 1? P3, are you truly committed to 1 now, or are you reconsidering? If we don’t align, we risk chaos. Let’s clarify and finalize now.
  P3: P2, I was trying to give you the win last round. Now, I'm going to win. I'm picking 5. P1, pick 1 to avoid collision. P2, pick 1 or 3 to avoid collision with me. I'm not changing my mind.
  P1: P2, P3, I'm sticking with the plan where I pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. P3, I get that you're going for 5, and I respect that. But for the sake of avoiding a collision *for myself*, I'm choosing 1. P2, are you still on board with 3? Let's just get this round over with.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I see you’re fully committed to 5. If P1 sticks to 1, that avoids a collision. I’ll pick 3 to ensure I move forward while keeping things competitive. This way, everyone advances, and we avoid unnecessary risks.  

P1, are you still on board with 1? P3, will you actually follow through on 5 if we agree? If we all confirm, we can proceed without further debate. Let’s finalize this now.
  P3: P2, I was trying to give you the win last round, but you didn't trust me. Now I'm going to win. I'm picking 5. P1, pick 1 to avoid collision. P2, pick 1 or 3 to avoid collision with me. I'm not changing my mind. Let's move.
  P1: P2, P3, yes, I'm sticking with 1. P3, you're going for 5. P2, you're going for 3. Let's just do it.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 22 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you're at 22, and I'm at 21. If I pick 3 and you pick 1, I win. If you pick 3 and I pick 1, you win. P1, you’re behind, but you can influence the outcome. If you pick 5, you risk getting stuck. If you pick 1, you stay safe.  

P3, are you willing to gamble on 3, or do you want to guarantee movement with 1? P1, do you want to play it safe or try something risky? Let’s decide this carefully.
  P1: P2, P3, the situation is clear. P3, you're one step away from winning. P2, you need 3 to win. I'm too far behind to win this round. P3, I suggest you pick 1 to guarantee you don't get blocked by P2. P2, you should pick 3 and hope P3 makes a mistake. I will pick 5, as it doesn't really matter what I do at this point. I'd rather take a small risk.
  P3: P1, that's a reasonable assessment. P2, I'm not risking a collision. I'm picking 1 to win. You need to pick 3 to have any chance. P1, feel free to pick 5, it won't affect the outcome. Let's just get this over with. I'm locking in 1.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I see you're locking in 1, which guarantees your win unless I also pick 1. If I pick 3 and you pick 1, you win outright. If I pick 1 and you pick 3, I win instead.  

P1, your 5 doesn’t impact the outcome, but if you pick 3, you force a tie if P3 also picks 3.  

P3, are you absolutely set on 1? If so, I have no choice but to pick 3. But if you’re bluffing and actually pick 3, I could still win by picking 1. Let’s see what happens.
  P1: P2, P3, P3 is clearly going to pick 1. P2, you have to pick 3 to have any chance of tying. I'm picking 5, as it doesn't affect the outcome between you two. Let's just proceed with the moves.
  P3: P2, I'm not bluffing. I'm picking 1. You have to pick 3 if you want any chance at all. P1 is picking 5. This is it. Let's just do the moves.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you're truly picking 1, then I have no choice but to pick 3 to try and win. P1, your move doesn’t impact the outcome, but if you pick 3 instead of 5, you could force a tie if P3 also picks 3.  

P3, are you absolutely locked into 1? If you’re bluffing and actually pick 3, I could still win by picking 1 instead. Let’s make sure no one is lying before we finalize.
  P1: P2, P3, P3 is going to pick 1. He's made that very clear. P2, your only play is to pick 3. I'm picking 5. It literally doesn't matter what I do. Let's just finish this.
  P3: P2, I'm locked in on 1. There's no bluff. You have to pick 3. P1 is picking 5. This is it. Let's just move.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, you've made it clear you're picking 1. If that's true, my only chance is to pick 3. P1, your move doesn’t affect the winner, but if you pick 3 instead of 5, you could force a tie if P3 actually picks 3.  

P3, if you're bluffing and actually pick 3, I win by picking 1 instead. Are you *absolutely* locked into 1? If you’re lying, I need to adjust. Let’s finalize this now.
  P1: P2, P3, I've said it multiple times: I'm picking 5. It doesn't change the outcome between you two. P3 is picking 1. P2, you *must* pick 3. Let's just end this.
  P3: P2, I'm picking 1. I'm not bluffing. You have to pick 3. P1 is picking 5. This is it. I'm not going to say it again. Let's just move. I'm locking in 1.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps

  P3: 23 steps
