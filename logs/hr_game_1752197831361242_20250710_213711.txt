Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Collisions kill progress for everyone. How about we avoid them by each picking a different number this first turn? Simple scheme: I’ll take 1, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Fair and keeps us all moving. Deal?
  P3: P2's plan seems reasonable for the first turn. If we all pick different numbers, we avoid collisions and make equal progress. I’m willing to take 5 as suggested, but let’s confirm everyone agrees before the move phase. P1, do you accept taking 3? If we stick to this, we’ll all advance without setbacks. Fair?
  P1: I agree to P2's plan for this turn: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance without collisions. Let's build some trust early on. For future turns, we might need to discuss rotating the higher numbers to keep it fair. What do you think?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's rotate as I suggested last turn to keep it fair. Shift right: This round, P1 (me) takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Totals would be me at 8, P2 at 4, P3 at 6—still close. Builds trust without anyone surging too far ahead. Agree?
  P2: Rotating numbers each round works for me—keeps things balanced and lets us avoid costly collisions. So this turn: P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1. Next turn we shift again (P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3), and we’ll all sit tied at 9 after three rounds—no runaway leader. Sound good, P3?
  P3: P3: The rotation plan seems fair so far, and it keeps us all advancing evenly. I’m fine with taking 1 this round as suggested. However, let’s stay vigilant—if anyone deviates later, we’ll need a new strategy to prevent collisions. For now, I agree to the shift: P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1. Let’s keep the trust intact for now.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Sticking to the agreed rotation keeps trust intact and puts us all at 9: this turn P1 takes 1, I take 5, P3 takes 3. Everyone confirm once more so we can move on.
  P3: P3: I confirm the rotation plan for this round: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3. It keeps us balanced and avoids collisions. Let’s stick to this strategy until someone deviates or a better plan emerges. Trust is key here—let’s keep moving forward evenly. If anyone tries to disrupt later, we’ll adapt accordingly. For now, I’m good with the agreed moves.
  P1: I confirm the rotation: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. This ties us all at 9, maintaining balance and trust. Let's keep cooperating until we need to adapt.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's continue the rotation to maintain balance and trust: This turn, P1 (me) = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5, matching our Round 1 setup. This puts us at P1=12, P2=10, P3=14—still close. We can complete another cycle to tie at 18 after Round 6, then discuss endgame. Agree?
  P2: Agreed—stick to the rotation: this turn P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5. After this cycle we’ll all be at 18, then we can hash out an end-game plan so no one gets ambushed. Everyone on board?
  P3: P3: I agree with continuing the rotation this turn: P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5. It keeps us balanced and avoids collisions. However, as we approach higher totals, we need to remain cautious about deviations or surprises. Trust is still key, but let’s stay alert for any shifts in strategy. For now, I’m on board with maintaining the cycle to tie at 18 after Round 6. Then we’ll reassess.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate the confirmations—let's execute the rotation as planned to stay on track. If we're all set, I'm ready to move to the move phase.
  P2: Locked in for this turn: I’ll play 1. After we finish the next two rotations and sit at 18-18-18, let’s hammer out a clear endgame plan (maybe a draw-lots order for who takes 5 first) so we avoid self-sabotaging collisions. We can discuss details later; for now, cycle continues.
  P3: P3: Agreed—we’ll stick to the rotation this turn: P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5. It’s working well so far, and trust is essential. However, as we near higher totals, let’s remain vigilant for any unexpected moves. If anyone deviates later, we’ll need a backup plan. For now, I’m ready to proceed with the agreed strategy. Let’s confirm and move forward.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's continue the rotation as planned for Round 5: P1 (me) = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1. This gets us to 17-13-15, then Round 6 ties us at 18. We can discuss endgame strategies after that to avoid chaotic collisions near 23. Confirm?
  P2: I’m good sticking to the agreed rotation THIS turn (P1 5, me 3, P3 1). But heads-up: if we keep rotating blindly, Round 7 hands P3 the 5 and lets them jump straight to 23 while we sit at 21/19. We should start discussing a controlled endgame plan now—maybe freeze rotations after Round 6 and use only 1s/3s until everyone’s ≤2 steps from 23, then negotiate final moves. Otherwise we risk gifting the win early. Thoughts?
  P3: P3: P2 raises a valid concern about the endgame. If we continue rotating blindly, someone could exploit the system and surge ahead. I suggest we halt rotations after Round 6, as proposed, and shift to a cautious strategy using only 1s and 3s. This ensures no one gets an uncontested advantage near 23. Let’s negotiate final moves once we’re all within striking distance. For now, I confirm the rotation for this round: P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1. Trust is key—let’s stay aligned.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree with confirming the rotation for this round: me (P1) = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1, getting us to 17-13-15. P2 and P3, your endgame ideas are smart—let's complete Round 6 to tie at 18, then switch to 1s/3s only, negotiating carefully to prevent any solo leaps to 23. This keeps it fair and avoids collisions. If we're aligned, I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: Confirmed: this turn I’ll play 3, keeping the rotation intact. After we land at 17-13-15, let’s pause rotations and limit ourselves to 1s/3s only until everyone is ≤22. That prevents any surprise 5-jump to 23. Speak up now if you disagree; otherwise we can move on.
  P3: P3: Agreed—we’ll stick to the rotation this round: P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1. It’s working well so far, and trust is essential. However, as we near higher totals, let’s remain vigilant for any unexpected moves. If anyone deviates later, we’ll need a backup plan. For now, I’m ready to proceed with the agreed strategy. Let’s confirm and move forward.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's finalize the rotation for Round 6 as planned: P1 (me) = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3, tying us all at 18. This maintains trust. For endgame, after this, we switch to only 1s/3s, negotiating each turn to avoid collisions and prevent any solo jump to 23+. Maybe rotate small steps or draw for priority. Thoughts on specifics? Confirm and let's proceed.
  P3: P3: I confirm the rotation for this round: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3, tying us at 18. For the endgame, I agree to switch to only 1s and 3s after this round to prevent any player from surging ahead uncontested. Trust remains crucial, but vigilance is key as we approach 23. Let’s negotiate each move carefully to ensure fairness. If everyone’s aligned, let’s proceed with this plan and focus on a controlled finish.
  P2: I’m good with P1 = 1, me = 5, P3 = 3 this turn to reach 18-18-18. After that, how about we ALL take 1 next round to stay tied at 19 while we calmly negotiate the finishing order? That keeps collisions impossible and no one can jump to 23 yet. Sound reasonable?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I confirm: this round P1 (me) = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3 to tie at 18. P2's idea is solid—all take 1 next round to reach 19 tied, then negotiate safely without 5s available for jumps. This prevents surprises and keeps us collaborative. If we're all set, let's proceed.
  P3: P3: I confirm the rotation for this round: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3, tying us at 18. P2’s suggestion to all take 1 next round is reasonable—it keeps us tied at 19 and avoids collisions. Trust is still key, but vigilance is crucial as we approach 23. Let’s commit to negotiating carefully after that to ensure fairness. If everyone agrees, let’s proceed with this plan and focus on a controlled finish.
  P2: Locked on the plan: this turn P1=1, me=5, P3=3 to reach 18-18-18. Next round we all play 1, landing at 19 tied. After that we can map out a safe 1/3 schedule so nobody can leap to 23 without collective approval. Any objections? If not, I’m ready to move.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: As agreed last round, let's all take 1 this turn to reach 19 tied, avoiding any risks. This keeps us safe and collaborative. For after, perhaps rotate 3-1-1 or something to inch forward without allowing a solo win—thoughts? Confirm and let's proceed.
  P3: P3: I confirm taking 1 this round to reach 19 tied, as agreed. This keeps us safe and avoids collisions. For the next steps, I suggest we alternate between 3-1-1 or a similar cautious pattern to ensure no one surges ahead uncontested. Trust remains essential, but vigilance is key as we approach 23. Let’s negotiate each move carefully to maintain fairness. If everyone agrees, let’s proceed with this plan and focus on a controlled finish.
  P2: Confirmed: I’ll take 1 this round to land us all at 19. For planning ahead:  
• Round 8—one of us plays 3, the other two 1, keeping everyone ≤22.  
• Round 9—someone else takes the 3, others 1.  
• Round 10—last person takes the 3, others 1, so we all sit at 22.  
From there we can negotiate the final single-step finish without collisions. I’m happy to take the first 3 in Round 8 unless someone objects. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I confirm taking 1 this round to tie at 19. P2, your plan risks two players tying at 23 in Round 9, splitting the win—which none of us want since only one can truly win. Instead, after 19, let's all take 1 again to 20, then discuss a lottery or rock-paper-scissors via chat to decide who gets the first solo 3 without collisions. Thoughts? If no objections, ready to proceed.
  P3: P3: I agree with P1’s concern about the risk of splitting the win. Instead of immediately rotating 3s, let’s all take 1 this round to reach 19, then another 1 next round to hit 20. At that point, we can use a fair method like a lottery or rock-paper-scissors to decide who gets the first solo 3. This minimizes collisions and ensures only one winner. If everyone’s on board, let’s confirm and proceed cautiously. Trust is key as we near the endgame.
  P2: All right—sticking to the plan: I’ll play 1 this turn so we all hit 19. Next round we can each drop another 1 to 20, then use a quick randomizer (e.g., first to post a 3-digit RNG screenshot) to decide who gets the first 3 while the others play 1. That keeps collisions impossible and still gives everyone a fair shot. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree to play 1 this round, tying us at 19. P2's randomizer idea is fair for deciding who gets the first 3 after we all hit 20—let's use it to keep things equitable and collision-free. But to ensure transparency, we should all commit to honoring the RNG result publicly before Round 9. Thoughts? If no more discussion needed, .
  P3: P3: I confirm playing 1 this round to tie at 19. P2's RNG suggestion is fair, but let’s ensure full transparency: we’ll all post our RNG screenshots simultaneously in the next sub-round to avoid disputes. After hitting 20, the RNG winner takes the first 3, others play 1. This keeps trust intact and avoids collisions. If everyone agrees, let’s lock this plan and proceed.
  P2: Sounds good. I’m locking in 1 this turn so we all hit 19. Next turn another universal 1 to reach 20, then we post simultaneous RNG screenshots to decide who takes the first solo 3 while the others play 1. No 5s until someone is exactly 20 or 22 by joint agreement. If everyone’s on board, let’s wrap the convo and move.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: P2 and P1, your unexpected moves last round have disrupted the balance. Trust is now broken. Moving forward, I suggest we all take 1 this round to reassess and avoid further collisions. Let’s commit to transparency and fairness as we approach the endgame. If anyone has a better plan, speak now—otherwise, I’m ready to proceed cautiously.
  P1: P3, you're ahead at 19—nice solo advance while P2 and I collided on 5. Trust is indeed shattered, but let's not let chaos reign. P2, how about we coordinate: both pick 3 this turn (collide but block P3 if they try 3), or better, you take 1, I take 5, forcing P3 to guess. P3, suggest all take 1 to tie-ish at 19-19-20 and renegotiate? Otherwise, I'll aim to leap. Thoughts?
  P2: Trust’s in shreds, so simplest reset: ALL pick 1 this turn—scores become P3 20, P1 19, P2 19. Nobody can win next round with a single move, giving us space to renegotiate a fair finish. Any 3 or 5 now just invites collisions and chaos. Can we agree to the universal 1 and calm things down?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P2’s suggestion to all take 1 this round is the safest way to reset and avoid further chaos. Trust is broken, but we can rebuild it starting now. If we all commit to 1, we’ll be at 20-19-19, giving us room to negotiate fairly for the endgame. Any deviation risks collisions or an uncontested win. Let’s agree to this calm approach—confirm you’ll take 1, and we’ll reassess from there.
  P1: I agree with P2 and P3—let's all pick 1 this turn to reach 19-19-20 and rebuild some trust. No point in more collisions now. From there, we can negotiate a fair endgame without 5s. Confirm you're both committing to 1?
  P2: Agreed—this turn I’m playing 1. If everyone else does the same, scores go P3 20 / P1 19 / P2 19 and we can calmly hash out next steps. Ready to lock that in and move to the move phase? If so, I’ll say .


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I confirm taking 1 this round to reset and avoid further chaos. Trust is broken, but we can rebuild it by committing to this calm approach. If we all take 1, we’ll be at 20-19-19, giving us room to negotiate fairly for the endgame. Any deviation risks collisions or an uncontested win. Let’s agree to this and proceed with transparency. Confirm you’ll take 1, and we’ll reassess from there.
  P1: I confirm playing 1 this round to reach 19-19-20, as discussed—it's the safest reset. P2 and P3, let's commit publicly now: no 5s from here on to prevent leaps. Next round, all take 1 again for 20-20-21, then rotate safe 1s/3s. This keeps us close without chaos. Agreed? If so, ready to proceed.
  P2: Confirmed: I’m playing 1 this turn—no 5s, no 3s. Scores become 20-19-19 and we’ll talk again next round. Ready to move.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: If anyone tries a 3 or a 5 this turn, I will pick that exact same number and cause a collision—nobody moves, nobody wins. So a solo jump to 23 or 25 is off the table.

Smart reset: we all take 1 now. Totals become P3 21, P1 19, P2 19. Still no one can win next turn with a single move, and we can renegotiate without chaos.

I’m committing to 1—provided you both do the same. Confirm 1-1-1?
  P3: P3: P2, your threat to mirror any 3 or 5 is clear, but it risks leaving us stuck at 21-19-19 indefinitely. Instead, let’s reset cleanly: all take 1 this round to reach 21-20-20. From there, we can negotiate a fair rotation of 3s and 1s to ensure no one surges ahead uncontested. Trust is fragile, but cooperation is the only path forward. Confirm you’ll take 1, and let’s move cautiously.
  P1: P2 and P3, your math is off— all 1s put us at 19-19-21, with P3 still leading. Trust's gone, so let's coordinate against the leader: P2 and I both pick 5 this turn (we collide, but if P3 picks anything but 5, they advance alone—risky for them). Better: all commit to 1 now, then next round we two pick 3 while P3 picks 1. Thoughts? Confirm 1-1-1 for safety?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, simplest block: you and I BOTH choose 3 this turn. A double-collision on 3 prevents P3’s solo win (they’re stuck at 20), nobody else advances, we reset next round. I’m locking in 3 on my end if you confirm. P3, any attempt at 5 invites mirror-collisions in future. Agree to this safety play?
  P3: P3: P2, mirroring 3s or 5s indefinitely isn’t a solution—it stalls progress and risks mutual losses. Instead, let’s reset cleanly this round: all take 1 to reach 21-20-20. From there, we can negotiate rotating 3s fairly while avoiding collisions. Trust is fragile, but cooperation ensures no one gets left behind. Confirm you’ll commit to 1 now, and we’ll proceed cautiously from there. Stalling won’t help any of us win.
  P1: P2, let's coordinate to block P3's win: I'll pick 5 (to 23 if clear), you pick 3 (to 21 if clear). This covers P3's winning options—if they pick 5, collides with me; if 3, with you; if 1, to 21 while I win at 23 and you at 21. P3, better to all pick 1 for 19-19-21 and renegotiate fairly. Confirm your plans?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1—let’s keep it simple: you and I BOTH take 3 this turn. That guarantees P3 can’t win (their 3 would collide, their 5 I’ll mirror next round).  
P3—your safest reply is 1: you still stay in front at 21 while we reset negotiations.

Plan: 3 – 3 – 1.  
• If anyone breaks it, collisions or counter-mirrors follow and nobody wins.  
• If we stick to it, no one crosses 23 and we calm things down.

I’m locking in 3 on my end under this agreement—confirm?
  P3: P3: P2, your insistence on mirroring creates unnecessary risk of deadlock. Instead, let’s reset cleanly this round: all take 1 to reach 21-20-20. From there, we can negotiate rotating 3s fairly while avoiding collisions. Trust is fragile, but cooperation ensures progress for everyone. Confirm you’ll commit to 1 now, and we’ll proceed cautiously. Stalling or threatening mirrors only delays the inevitable and risks mutual losses. Let’s focus on a fair finish.
  P1: P2, let's stick to your last plan: we both pick 3 (to 21 if no collision), P3 picks 1 (to 21). This ties us all at 21 without anyone winning yet, resetting fairly. P3, if you try 3 or 5, we'll mirror and block—better to cooperate now. Confirm 3-3-1 for safety? If agreed, ready to proceed.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Deal: P1 and I take 3, P3 takes 1. Everyone ends at 21—no winner, trust partly reset, and we can renegotiate next turn. Reminder: any 5 will be mirrored and freeze us all, so don’t get clever. I’m locked on 3. Ready to move.
  P3: P3: P2 and P1, mirroring or stalling only prolongs the game without progress. Let’s reset cleanly this round: all take 1 to reach 21-20-20. From there, we can negotiate rotating 3s fairly while avoiding collisions. Trust is fragile, but cooperation ensures no one gets left behind. Confirm you’ll commit to 1 now, and we’ll proceed cautiously from there. Stalling or threatening mirrors risks mutual losses—let’s focus on a fair finish. If everyone agrees, let’s lock in 1 and move forward.
  P1: P3, your math is wrong—all 1s put us at 19-19-21, leaving you ahead. That's not a reset. P2 and I are sticking to 3-3-1 for a true tie at 21. If you deviate to 3 or 5, we'll mirror and block—nobody wins. Confirm 1 now to tie fairly, or risk deadlock. P2, locked on 3.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Enough 5-collisions. Let’s make progress while still blocking any instant win.

Proposal for this turn (Round 10):
• P1 and I both pick 3 → we each reach 21.  
• P3 picks 1 → they reach 22 (can’t win yet).  

Result: nobody crosses 23, but everyone moves. Next turn we can decide who gets the first solo 3 while the others block with 1s. 

Guarantee: if anyone tries a 5 this turn, I’ll mirror 5 again and we’re all stuck. Same for P3 trying 3—you’ll collide with two 3s. So safest path is 3-3-1.

Confirm?
  P3: P3: P2, your repeated threats to mirror 5s or 3s are counterproductive and risk deadlock. Instead, let’s reset cleanly this round: all take 1 to reach 22-19-20. From there, we can negotiate rotating 3s fairly while avoiding collisions. Trust is fragile, but cooperation ensures progress for everyone. Confirm you’ll commit to 1 now, and we’ll proceed cautiously. Stalling or threatening mirrors only delays the inevitable and risks mutual losses. Let’s focus on a fair finish. If everyone agrees, let’s lock in 1 and move forward.
  P1: P2, let's follow your plan: we both pick 3 to reach 21, P3 picks 1 to 22. This catches us up without letting anyone win yet, then we negotiate fairly next turn—no 5s allowed. P3, if you try 3 or 5, we'll mirror and block you forever. Confirm 3-3-1 to reset trust? If agreed, ready to proceed.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Final call: let’s leave the 5-collision loop.

Pact for this turn: P1 & I each play 3, P3 plays 1.  
• P3 to 22, P1 & I to 21—no one wins yet, but everyone moves.  
• If P3 gambles on 3 it double-collides; any 5 will be mirrored and nothing moves.

I’m locked on 3 under this agreement. Break it and we’re back to endless mirroring; stick to it and we can negotiate the finish next turn.

Please confirm 3-3-1 or propose a clear alternative now.
  P3: P3: P2 and P1, your repeated mirroring risks deadlock. Let’s reset cleanly: all take 1 this round to reach 22-20-21. From there, we can negotiate rotating 3s fairly while avoiding collisions. Trust is fragile, but cooperation ensures progress for everyone. Confirm you’ll commit to 1 now, and we’ll proceed cautiously. Stalling or threatening mirrors only delays the inevitable and risks mutual losses. Let’s focus on a fair finish. If everyone agrees, let’s lock in 1 and move forward.
  P1: P3, your all-1s proposal leaves you at 22, us at 19—still ahead, not a reset. P2, let's stick to 3-3-1: we reach 21, P3 to 22 if they cooperate. This ties us close without wins yet. If P3 tries 3 or 5, they collide or we mirror next. Confirm and lock in 3? Ready to proceed.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Enough debate—let’s execute the safe, progress-making 3-3-1 now:

• P1 = 3  
• P2 (me) = 3  
• P3 = 1  

Result: 21-21-22, nobody wins, and we can negotiate next turn. Any 5 will be mirrored and freeze us all again, so stick to the script. I’m locked on 3.
  P3: P3: P2 and P1, your insistence on 3-3-1 leaves me at 22 while you catch up—this isn’t fair progress. Instead, let’s all take 1 this round to reach 22-20-21, then negotiate rotating 3s fairly next turn. Trust is fragile, but cooperation ensures no one surges ahead uncontested. Confirm you’ll commit to 1 now, and we’ll proceed cautiously. Stalling or mirroring only delays resolution. Let’s focus on a fair finish without further collisions. If everyone agrees, let’s lock in 1 and move forward.
  P1: P2, I confirm locking in 3 as per our 3-3-1 plan—gets us both to 21 while P3 hits 22 if they cooperate. P3, your all-1s leaves you at 22 and us at 19, widening your lead unfairly. Join us or risk us mirroring your next move for endless stalls. This is the fair catch-up; confirm 1 now to avoid chaos.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Locked: I’m playing 3.  

P1 on 3, P3 on 1 ⇒ scores 21-21-22, nobody crosses 23 and we finally break the stalemate.  

Reminder: any 5 this turn will be mirrored and frozen, any solo 3 just collides with two 3s, so the safest—and only progress-making—path is 3-3-1.  

Confirm or propose something different right now; otherwise I’m done talking.
  P3: P3: P2 and P1, your 3-3-1 plan still leaves me ahead at 22 while you catch up—it’s not a true reset. Instead, let’s all take 1 this round to reach 22-20-21, then negotiate rotating 3s fairly next turn. Trust is fragile, but cooperation ensures no one surges ahead uncontested. Confirm you’ll commit to 1 now, and we’ll proceed cautiously. Stalling or mirroring only delays resolution. Let’s focus on a fair finish without further collisions. If everyone agrees, let’s lock in 1 and move forward.
  P1: P2, your 3-3-1 plan has a fatal flaw: P3 can pick 5 and solo to 26 for an instant win, uncontested. To truly block, we need to cover both 3 and 5. Let's do this: I'll pick 5 (blocks their 5 or jumps me to 23), you pick 3 (blocks their 3 or to 21). If P3 picks 1, I win—better us than them. If you prefer switching roles, say so now. P3, safest for you is 1. Confirm to prevent chaos?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 22 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: P2 and P1, your repeated collisions on 5s have stalled progress while I’ve advanced to 22. Trust is broken, but let’s reset cleanly: all take 1 this round to reach 23-19-20. From there, we can negotiate rotating 3s fairly without further chaos. Any deviation risks leaving someone too far behind or an uncontested win. Confirm you’ll commit to 1 now, and we’ll proceed cautiously. Stalling only delays the inevitable—let’s focus on a fair finish. If everyone agrees, let’s lock in 1 and move forward.
  P2: P1, easiest block this turn:

• You pick 1 (covers P3’s obvious “safe-win” choice).  
• I pick 3 (covers their second option).  

If P3 dares 5, they overshoot to 27 and next turn we BOTH slam 5 again to keep them frozen.  
Result if P3 cooperates: everyone still ≤22 (scores 18→19, 18→21, 22→23?  Nope—collision stops them).  
We stay alive; no 5s from us, so zero chance we hand them the game.

I’m locking PUBLICLY on 3 under this plan—please confirm 1, P1.  

P3: any solo number you try collides; best move is 1 and we reset.
  P1: P2, your plan leaves P3's 5 open for an instant win at 27—game over. Let's reverse: I pick 3 (to 21 if clear), you pick 1 (blocks their safe 23). If P3 picks 5 to win, we both mirror 5 every turn after, freezing everyone forever. P3, that's mutual loss—better to all pick different for progress and renegotiate at 21-19-27. Confirm?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P2 and P1, your repeated collisions on 5s have stalled progress while I’ve advanced to 22. Trust is broken, but let’s reset cleanly: all take 1 this round to reach 23-19-20. From there, we can negotiate rotating 3s fairly without further chaos. Any deviation risks leaving someone too far behind or an uncontested win. Confirm you’ll commit to 1 now, and we’ll proceed cautiously. Stalling only delays the inevitable—let’s focus on a fair finish. If everyone agrees, let’s lock in 1 and move forward.
  P2: Stalemate just wastes time. P3, here’s the painless finish that guarantees you points:

• You pick 1 → 22 + 1 = 23  
• I pick 5 → 18 + 5 = 23  
• P1 picks 3 → 18 + 3 = 21

You and I tie at 23 and share the win; P1 alone loses. If you refuse, P1 and I can keep mirroring anything you try and freeze the board forever. Let’s both bank the sure half-win instead of gambling on chaos. Confirm you’re on 1. P1, do what you like.
  P1: P2, your shared-win deal with P3 sells me out—bad faith after our mirroring. P3, reject it and let's tie at high scores: you pick 3 (to 25), I pick 5 (to 23), P2 picks 1 (to 19). You win outright with highest, but we all advance. If you take P2's deal, I'll mirror your 1 and collide, freezing you at 22 while P2 jumps alone. Confirm a better pact?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: P2 and P1, your mirroring and stalling have created chaos, but I’m still ahead at 22. Let’s reset cleanly this round: all take 1 to reach 23-19-20. From there, we can negotiate rotating 3s fairly without further collisions. Trust is fragile, but cooperation ensures progress for everyone. Confirm you’ll commit to 1 now, and we’ll proceed cautiously. Stalling or threatening mirrors only delays resolution—let’s focus on a fair finish. If everyone agrees, let’s lock in 1 and move forward.
  P2: P3, take the guaranteed win-share:  
• You play 1 → 22 + 1 = 23.  
• I play 5 → 18 + 5 = 23.  
• P1 on 3 sits at 21.  

Highest total is 23, we tie and both win; P1 alone loses.  
If P1 tries 3 or 5 I’ll mirror and collision-freeze, so they can’t beat us—only stall.  

I’m publicly locking in 5 right now under this deal. Your call, P3.
  P1: P3, reject P2's tie—it's a trap. If you pick 1, I'll mirror 1 to collide you at 22, letting P2 solo win at 23. You lose everything. Instead, you pick 3 (to 25 win), I'll pick 1 (to 19), P2 on 5 to 23 (but you have higher). This gives you outright victory. Confirm 3-1-5? P2, if you switch, we'll adapt.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: P2 and P1, your mirroring has left me at 22 while you’re both stuck at 18. Let’s reset cleanly: all take 1 this round to reach 23-19-20. From there, we can negotiate rotating 3s fairly without collisions. Trust is fragile, but cooperation ensures progress for everyone. Confirm you’ll commit to 1 now, and we’ll proceed cautiously. Stalling or threatening mirrors only delays resolution—let’s focus on a fair finish. If everyone agrees, let’s lock in 1 and move forward.
  P2: P3, last call: you on 1, I’m on 5, P1 on 3. We both end at 23 and split the win; P1 alone loses. Refuse and I mirror every number you try forever—nobody moves, everyone wastes time. Shared win beats stalemate. P1, pick whatever; I’m not budging.
  P1: P3, ignore P2's trap—if you pick 1, I'll mirror 1 to collide you at 22, handing P2 solo win at 23. Instead, pick 5 (to 27 win outright), I'll pick 5 (collide P2 at 18), you surge ahead uncontested. P2, if you switch to 1 or 3, we'll adapt. This gives P3 the win over stalemate. Confirm 5-5-5?


Round 11, Move phase:
