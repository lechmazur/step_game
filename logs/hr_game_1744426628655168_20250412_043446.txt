Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions. How about we each pick different moves this turn? P1: 1, P2: 3, me: 5. No conflicts, everyone advances. Win-win for now. Thoughts?
  P2: I’m on board with the plan, P3. Picking different moves makes sense for now to ensure we all advance. I’ll go with 3 as suggested. P1, are you okay with taking 1? Let’s keep this fair and avoid any collisions this round.
  P1: P3, your plan sounds reasonable, but let's consider the long-term strategy. If we keep rotating moves, one of us will eventually have to break the pattern to win. How about we agree to mix up our moves unpredictably after a few rounds to keep everyone on their toes? For now, I'll go with 1, but let's be ready to adapt. What do you both think?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's stick with the same plan this round (P1:1, P2:3, me:5) to keep advancing safely. No conflicts, we all gain. P1, agree this builds trust—next round we can reassess strategy once positions are clearer. Consistency now avoids chaos. Confirm your moves!
  P1: P3, I understand the desire for consistency, but let's not get too predictable. If we keep doing the same thing, it might backfire later. How about we switch it up a bit this round? I'll take 3, P2 can take 5, and you take 1. This way, we still avoid collisions but keep things dynamic. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, I see your point about avoiding predictability, and I’m open to switching things up. Let’s go with your suggestion this round—P1:3, me:5, and P3:1. It still ensures no collisions and keeps the game dynamic. P3, are you okay with this adjustment? Let’s confirm and move forward together.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, it seems we had a collision last round. Let's ensure we all advance this time. How about I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3? This way, we avoid repeating the same mistakes. We can reassess and adapt our strategy in the next round based on the updated positions. Agreed?
  P2: P1, I agree we need to avoid collisions this round after last turn’s mistake. Your suggestion of P1:5, P2:1, and P3:3 works for me. It’s a fair split, and we all get to advance. P3, are you on board with this plan? Let’s confirm and stick to it this time to keep progressing.
  P3: Agreed. P1:5, P2:1, me:3. Let’s strictly follow this to avoid collisions. Trust is crucial—no deviations. Confirm and proceed!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 =>

  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re at a critical point with P1 at 9, P3 at 8, and me at 4. Let’s avoid collisions again this round to keep advancing. I propose P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This ensures no conflicts and helps us all progress. We can rethink strategy next round as positions shift. Are you both in? Let’s confirm and stick to this plan.
  P1: P2, I see your plan and it makes sense to avoid collisions. However, given our current positions, I suggest we switch it up a bit to keep things unpredictable. How about I take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1? This way, we still avoid collisions and keep the game dynamic. P3, are you okay with this adjustment? Let's agree and proceed strategically.
  P3: P1, your proposal shifts you to 12 while limiting me to 9. P2's plan (P1:1, P2:3, me:5) ensures balanced progress—no one leaps ahead prematurely. After Round 2's collision from last-minute changes, consistency is safer. Let’s stick with P2’s original split this round to avoid risks. We can strategize next round when positions are clearer. Agreed?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, it seems we're at a crucial point with previous collisions slowing us down. Let's ensure we all advance this time. How about I take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3? This allows us to avoid collisions and keeps the game dynamic. We can reassess our positions next round. Agreed?
  P2: P1, I appreciate the suggestion to avoid collisions, but your plan puts me at 9 while you’re at 10 and P3 at 11, widening the gap. Let’s balance progress instead. How about P1:3, P2:5, P3:1? This gets me to 9, P1 to 12, and P3 to 9, keeping us closer while avoiding conflicts. We can adjust next round based on positions. P3, are you okay with this? Let’s confirm and stick to it to ensure we all advance this time. Agreed?
  P3: P2, your plan gives P1 +3 (to 12), while P1's proposal only gives them +1. Supporting their plan limits P1's gain. Let’s all advance: P1:1 (10), you:5 (9), me:3 (11). No collisions, and you maximize your progress. Lock this in!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the need for balance, but we also need to consider the potential for collisions. P2, your plan is fair, but if we keep colliding, none of us will advance. Let’s try my suggestion: P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. This way, we avoid collisions and everyone progresses. P3, your advancement is crucial too, and this plan keeps us competitive. Let's confirm and move forward strategically. Agreed?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the merits in both plans, but we must avoid another collision. P1’s suggestion (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) maximizes my progress to 9, keeps P1 at 10, and P3 at 11—fairly close. It ensures no conflicts and keeps us all advancing. P3, I know you’re concerned about balance, but this split works for now. We can reassess next round. Let’s lock this in to guarantee progress. Agreed?
  P3: Lock in P1:1, P2:5, me:3. No deviations—trust is key. Let’s all advance and avoid another collision. Confirm and proceed to move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, we need to avoid repeating past mistakes. Let's stick to the plan: P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. This ensures no collisions and allows everyone to advance. Trust is crucial; let's lock in these moves and reassess our strategy next round based on updated positions. Agreed?
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligning on P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. This plan ensures we all advance without collisions, bringing me to 9, P1 to 10, and P3 to 11—keeping the game tight and competitive. Let’s stick to this with no last-minute changes to avoid another Round 4 disaster. Trust is essential now as we’re all close to the finish. We can strategize further next round based on new positions. Confirm once more and let’s move forward together. Agreed?
  P3: **Final confirmation: P1:1, P2:5, me:3. No changes—strict adherence ensures we all advance. Let’s lock this in and move.**

  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we're all close, so let's ensure no collisions. How about I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5? This keeps our progress balanced and avoids conflicts. We need to stay strategic and unpredictable to prevent anyone from pulling too far ahead. Let's confirm and move forward with this plan to keep the game competitive. Agreed?
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree we’re at a tight spot and need to avoid collisions. P1’s plan of P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 works for balance, getting me to 10, P1 to 13, and P3 to 16. It keeps us competitive without major gaps. Let’s stick to this to ensure we all advance, and we can reassess next round as we near the finish. No deviations to maintain trust. Are you both in? Confirm and let’s proceed.
  P3: Agreed. P1:3, P2:1, me:5. Strict adherence avoids collisions. Any deviation risks mutual loss—trust is key. Confirm and proceed!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate the agreement on the current plan. Since we're all aligned, let's stick to P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 to ensure no collisions and balanced progress. This keeps the game competitive and avoids any setbacks. Trust is crucial here, so let's execute this strategy and reassess in the next round. Confirm once more, and let's proceed confidently.
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligned on P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This plan keeps us all advancing with no collisions and maintains a tight race. Let’s stick to it without any last-minute changes to preserve trust, especially since we’re so close to the finish. We can strategize further next round based on our new positions. Final confirmation from me—let’s lock this in and move forward. Agreed?
  P3: **Final confirmation: P1:3, P2:1, me:5. Strict adherence avoids collisions. Any deviation risks mutual loss—trust is key. Confirm and proceed!**


Round 6, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re in the final stretch with P3 at 16, P1 at 13, and me at 10. Let’s avoid collisions to keep advancing. I propose P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This brings P1 to 18, me to 13, and P3 to 17—keeping it close while ensuring no conflicts. We can reassess next round as we near the finish. Trust is vital now; no deviations. Are you both in? Confirm and let’s proceed with this plan to maintain a competitive balance. Agreed?
  P3: **Agree to P2's plan: P1:5, P2:3, me:1. Strict adherence required. Any deviation risks mutual loss. Confirm and proceed!**
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the importance of avoiding collisions, but let's consider a more strategic approach. How about I take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1? This would bring me to 16, P2 to 15, and P3 remains at 17. It keeps things competitive and unpredictable. We need to think ahead and not just follow a predictable pattern. Let's confirm this plan and keep the game dynamic. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see P1’s suggestion of P1:3, P2:5, P3:1, which gets me to 15, P1 to 16, and P3 to 17—very close. It’s tempting, but my original plan (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) pushes P1 to 18, me to 13, and P3 to 17, giving P1 a shot to win next round while keeping us competitive. Let’s stick with my plan to avoid sudden leaps and maintain trust. No deviations to prevent collisions. Final confirmation—let’s lock this in. Agreed?
  P3: **P2, your plan accelerates P1 towards victory. P1's suggestion keeps us closer. Let's adopt P1's plan: P1:3, P2:5, me:1. This maintains balance and prevents a single leader. Trust but verify—no deviations! **
  P1: P2 and P3, we're all very close to the finish line, so we need to be strategic. P2, your initial plan gives me a significant lead, which might not be the best for balance. Let's consider P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This keeps us tightly packed: me at 16, P2 at 15, and P3 at 17. It ensures no collisions and keeps the game competitive. Trust is key here; let's stick to this plan and reassess next round. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need for balance, but P1’s plan (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) puts me at 15, P1 at 16, and P3 at 17—very tight. It’s a fair compromise that keeps us all in striking distance of the win. Let’s go with this to avoid collisions and maintain trust. No deviations, as any misstep could cost us all. Final confirmation from me—let’s lock this in and proceed. Agreed?
  P3: **Lock in P1:3, P2:5, me:1. No deviations—trust is crucial. Confirm and proceed!**
  P1: P2 and P3, let's confirm P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This keeps us all close and avoids collisions. We're all in striking distance, and this plan maintains the balance. Trust is essential—no last-minute changes. Let's lock this in and proceed strategically. Agreed?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re incredibly close with P3 at 17, P1 at 16, and me at 15. Let’s avoid collisions and keep the race tight. I propose P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This brings P1 to 17, me to 18, and P3 to 22—potentially ending the game if no conflicts. It’s a risk, but ensures progress. We must stick to this with no deviations to maintain trust. Are you both in? Confirm and let’s proceed strategically. Agreed?
  P3: **Agree to P2's proposal: P1:1, P2:3, me:5. Strict adherence required—any deviation risks collision and mutual loss. Confirm to lock in and secure progress. Trust is paramount now. Let’s proceed!**
  P1: P2 and P3, I see the potential in P2's proposal, but it gives P3 a chance to win outright. How about we consider P1:5, P2:1, P3:3? This keeps me at 21, P2 at 16, and P3 at 20, maintaining a competitive balance. We all stay in the game, and it prevents an immediate win. Let's ensure trust and avoid collisions. Agreed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand P1’s concern about P3 winning outright with my plan. However, P1’s suggestion of P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 puts P1 at 21, potentially winning instead. Let’s compromise with P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This brings P1 to 19, me to 20, and P3 to 18—keeping us all under 20 and the game alive. It avoids collisions and maintains balance. Trust is critical; no deviations. Are you both in? Confirm and let’s lock this in to stay competitive. Agreed?
  P3: **P3:** P2's initial plan (P1:1, you:3, me:5) is collision-free and ensures progress. P2's new proposal benefits them alone. Let's avoid self-serving shifts. Stick to the original split; any deviation risks mutual loss. Trust through consistency—confirm P1:1, P2:3, P3:5!
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the concerns about balance and avoiding an outright win. Let's consider P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This keeps us all competitive: me at 19, P2 at 20, and P3 at 18. It avoids collisions and ensures no one wins outright this round. Trust is key; let's confirm this plan and proceed without deviations. Agreed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the merit in P1’s latest plan (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1), bringing us to P1:19, me:20, P3:18. It keeps us all under the winning threshold, maintains a tight race, and avoids collisions. Let’s lock this in with no deviations to preserve trust. We can reassess next round for the final push. This is the fairest split right now. Confirm and let’s proceed strategically. Agreed?
  P3: **P3:** Stick to P2's original plan: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. Any last-minute changes risk collisions, as Round 4 showed. Trust through consistency—deviations have cost us before. Confirm and lock in to avoid mutual loss. Let’s all advance safely!
  P1: P2 and P3, let's focus on a strategy that keeps us all competitive without giving anyone an outright win this round. I propose P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This keeps me at 19, P2 at 20, and P3 at 18. It ensures no collisions and keeps the game tight. Trust is crucial; let's confirm this plan and proceed without deviations. Agreed?
