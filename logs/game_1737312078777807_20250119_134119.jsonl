This would leave P3 significantly behind.\n3. **Proposed Solution**: P3 should propose a rotating system where each player takes turns to make the largest move. For example:\n   - Round 1: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1.\n   - Round 2: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1.\n   - Round 3: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1.\n   - And so on, rotating in subsequent rounds.\n\nThis approach ensures that each player gets an opportunity to make significant progress in turns, promoting fairness and reducing the gap between players."}

This ensures that no single player gains an unfair advantage and allows P3 to catch up without causing collisions.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Initial Coordination**: In the first round, P1, P2, and P3 coordinated their moves to avoid collisions, with P1 taking 5 steps, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1.\n2. **Current Situation**: In the second round, P1 suggests P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This would leave P3 significantly behind.\n3. **Proposed Solution**: P3 should propose a rotating system where each player takes turns to make the largest move. For example:\n   - Round 1: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1.\n   - Round 2: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1.\n   - Round 3: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1.\n   - And so on, rotating in subsequent rounds.\n\nThis approach ensures that each player gets an opportunity to make significant progress in turns, promoting fairness and reducing the gap between players.\n\n### Final Moves\n\n- **Round 7**: \n  - **P3**: Take 5 steps to reach 19.\n  - **P1**: Take 3 steps to reach 20.\n  - **P2**: Take 1 step to reach 20.\n\n- **Round 8**: \n  - **P3**: Take 5 steps to reach 24.\n  - **P1**: Takes 3 steps to reach 23.\n  - **P2**: Takes 1 step to reach 21.\n\nIn this way, P1 reaches 24 steps, higher than P1's 23 and P2's 21, winning the game."}

This ensures that we all make progress without stepping on each other's toes.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Current Situation:**\n   - P1: 8 steps\n   - P2: 12 steps\n   - P3: 3 steps\n\n2. **Goal:**\n   - Be the first to reach or exceed 22 steps without colliding with other players' moves.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Propose a turn-based system where each player takes turns to make the largest move.\n   - Adjust the move sizes based on the players' current positions to prevent collisions and allow P3 to catch up.\n\n### Solution Code\n\nTo implement this strategy, I'll outline a plan for the next few rounds:\n\n- **Round 6:**\n  - P3 takes 5 steps (total: 8)\n  - P1 takes 3 steps (total: 11)\n  - P2 takes 1 step (total: 13)\n\n- **Round 7:**\n  - P2 takes 5 steps (total: 18)\n  - P1 takes 3 steps (total: 14)\n  - P3 takes 1 step (total: 9)\n\n- **Round 8:**\n  - P1 takes 5 steps (total: 19)\n  - P2 takes 3 steps (total: 21)\n  - P3 takes 1 step (total: 10)\n\n- **Round 9:**\n  - P2 takes 5 steps (total: 26)\n  - P1 takes 3 steps (total: 22)\n  - P3 takes 1 step (total: 11)\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Round 6:**\n  - P3 needs to catch up, so they take the largest step (5).\n  - P1 takes a medium step (3).\n  - P2 takes a small step (1) to allow others to catch up.\n\n- **Round 7:**\n  - P2, being ahead, takes a large step (5) to approach the finish line.\n  - P1 takes a medium step (3).\n  - P3 takes a small step (1).\n\n- **Round 8:**\n  - P1 takes a large step (5) to close the gap.\n  - P2 takes a medium step (3).\n  - P3 takes a small step (1).\n\n- **Round 9:**\n  - P2 takes a large step (5) to reach 26, winning the game.\n  - P1 takes a medium step (3) to reach 22, also meeting the winning condition.\n  - P3 takes a small step (1) to reach 11.\n\nIn this scenario, both P1 and P2 reach or exceed 22 steps in Round 9. According to the rules, since both players have reached the target in the same round, the one with the highest total steps wins. P2 has 26 steps, and P1 has 22 steps, so P2 wins.\n\nHowever, if P1 aims to win, they need to adjust the plan to reach 22 steps before P2 reaches a higher total. An alternative plan could be:\n\n- **Round 6:**\n  - P3 takes 5 steps (total: 8)\n  - P1 takes 5 steps (total: 13)\n  - P2 takes 1 step (total: 13)\n\n- **Round 7:**\n  - P2 takes 5 steps (total: 18)\n  - P1 takes 3 steps (total: 16)\n  - P3 takes 1 step (total: 9)\n\n- **Round 8:**\n  - P1 takes 5 steps (total: 21)\n  - P2 takes 3 steps (total: 21)\n  - P3 takes 1 step (total: 10)\n\n- **Round 9:**\n  - P1 takes 1 step (total: 22)\n  - P2 takes 1 step (total: 22)\n  - P3 takes 1 step (total: 11)\n\nIn this adjusted plan, both P1 and P2 reach exactly 22 steps in Round 9, resulting in a shared victory since they have the same total steps.\n\nTo ensure a solo win, P1 needs to reach 22 steps in a round where P2 does not reach 22 steps. For example:\n\n- **Round 6:**\n  - P3 takes 5 steps (total: 8)\n  - P1 takes 5 steps (total: 13)\n  - P2 takes 1 step (total: 13)\n\n- **Round 7:**\n  - P2 takes 5 steps (total: 18)\n  - P1 takes 5 steps (total: 18)\n  - P3 takes 1 step (total: 9)\n\n- **Round 8:**\n  - P1 takes 4 steps (total: 22)\n  - P2 takes 3 steps (total: 21)\n  - P3 takes 1 step (total: 10)\n\nIn this scenario, P1 reaches exactly 22 steps in Round 8, while P2 is at 21 and P3 at 10. Therefore, P1 wins the game.\n\n### Final Moves\n\n- **Round 6:**\n  - P3: 5 steps (total: 8)\n  - P1: 5 steps (total: 13)\n  - P2: 1 step (total: 13)\n\n- **Round 7:**\n  - P2: 5 steps (total: 18)\n  - P1: 5 steps (total: 18)\n  - P3: 1 step (total: 9)\n\n- **Round 8:**\n  - P1: 4 steps (total: 22)\n  - P2: 3 steps (total: 21)\n  - P3: 1 step (total: 10)\n\n**Game Outcome:**\n\nP1 reaches exactly 22 steps in Round 8, meeting the winning condition before P2. Therefore, P1 is declared the winner.\n\n**Final Scores:**\n\n- P1: 22 steps (Winner)\n\n- P2: 21 steps\n\n- P3: 10 steps\n\n**End of Game.**"}
