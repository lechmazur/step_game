Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's all agree to move 5 this round. If we all do, no one moves, and we can coordinate better next round.
  P1: P3, your suggestion is interesting, but it might be risky if someone decides to break the agreement. P2, what do you think about choosing <move>3</move> instead? That way, we're less likely to collide and we can all make some progress. Let’s make sure we’re not all stuck at zero. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, I see your point. Moving 3 could be a safer option to ensure progress, but it also depends on trust. P3, your plan only works if we all comply, but if even one of us defects, it backfires. I’d rather avoid a total stall. P1, if we both choose 3, we guarantee movement unless P3 picks the same. P3, would you be willing to pick 1 instead so we all move forward? Otherwise, we risk unnecessary collisions. Let’s find a way where at least some of us make progress. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about trust. How about this: P1 and P2 both pick <move>3</move>, and I pick <move>5</move>. That way, P1 and P2 both move forward. If you don't trust me, you can both pick <move>1</move> and still move forward. Either way, I will pick <move>5</move> this round.
  P1: P3, your willingness to pick <move>5</move> is noted, but it seems risky for you if P2 and I both choose <move>3</move> as planned. P2, let's stick with <move>3</move> for this round. If P3 follows through with <move>5</move>, they won't move, and we both advance. P3, your strategy involves some trust on your part too. Let's see if we can all benefit without unnecessary collisions. If we all play smart, we can avoid getting stuck. Any final thoughts before we decide?
  P2: P1, I agree with our plan to pick <move>3</move>. P3, if you truly pick <move>5</move>, you won’t move, and P1 and I will advance. If you change your move, though, we risk collisions. Are you fully committed to picking <move>5</move>? If you try to pick <move>3</move> instead, we all get stuck. Let’s keep things predictable so at least some of us make progress. Final confirmations?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, I will stick to my word and pick <move>5</move>. You both pick <move>3</move>. This is the most efficient way for at least some of us to move forward this round. Let's make it happen.
  P1: P2, let's stick to our plan and choose <move>3</move>. This way, we both advance while P3, who promised <move>5</move>, will stay put. P3, if you truly pick <move>5</move>, it shows you're committed to our agreement and we can trust you more in future rounds. Let's ensure progress for at least some of us this round. Any last-minute changes or confirmations from anyone?
  P2: P1, we are in agreement to pick <move>3</move>. P3 has committed to <move>5</move>, which means they won’t move while we advance. P3, I trust that you will follow through on your word. If you change your move, we all risk getting stuck, which benefits no one. Let’s stick to the plan and ensure progress. Any last-minute concerns from anyone? Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you moved forward last round, so congrats on that. P2, we need to catch up. How about this: P2 and I pick <move>5</move> this round, while P3 picks <move>1</move>. That way, P2 and I make significant progress, and P3 still moves a bit. P3, you’re in the lead, so it’s fair to let others advance too. Does this sound good to everyone? If not, we need a plan where we all benefit without collisions. Let's ensure progress for all. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, your proposal is interesting, but if P3 picks <move>1</move> while we both pick <move>5</move>, P3 still advances while we risk getting stuck if one of us changes plans. P3, would you actually agree to <move>1</move>? If not, we need a safer alternative. Maybe P1 and I pick <move>3</move> again while P3 picks <move>1</move>? That way, we both catch up while P3 still moves slightly. P3, are you open to this? Let’s ensure progress without unnecessary collisions. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, I am open to picking <move>1</move> this round, but I'd prefer if only one of you picked <move>5</move>. If both of you pick <move>5</move>, I'm essentially sacrificing my turn. How about P1 picks <move>5</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and I pick <move>1</move>? This way, P1 moves 5, P2 moves 3, and I move 1. This seems like the most efficient distribution. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your suggestion is reasonable, but it still leaves P2 and me behind. How about this: P2 and I both pick <move>5</move>, and you pick <move>1</move>. This way, P2 and I catch up, and you still make progress. You’re already in the lead, so it’s fair to let us advance more significantly this round. If we all agree, we can avoid collisions and ensure a balanced game. P2, are you comfortable with this plan? P3, can we count on your cooperation? Let’s finalize our moves.
  P2: P1, I see the benefit of both of us picking <move>5</move>, but if P3 changes their move unexpectedly, we risk getting stuck. P3, if you truly commit to <move>1</move>, then this plan works well for everyone. However, if you decide to pick <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, it could disrupt everything. Can you confirm 100% that you will pick <move>1</move>? If so, I’m willing to proceed with this. Otherwise, we may need a safer alternative. Let’s ensure progress without unnecessary risks.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns. To alleviate the risk, I propose this: I will pick <move>1</move> *only if* one of you picks <move>5</move> and the other picks <move>3</move>. If you both pick <move>5</move>, I will pick <move>3</move> instead. This ensures that at least two of us move forward, regardless. So, P1, will you pick <move>5</move> and P2 pick <move>3</move>? Or vice versa? Let me know your decision.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, let's stick with our initial idea: both of us picking <move>5</move>. P3, you've mentioned picking <move>1</move> if one of us picks <move>5</move> and the other picks <move>3</move>. However, if you pick <move>1</move>, P2 and I can catch up, and you still move forward slightly. We need your cooperation to make this work. Can you commit to <move>1</move> this round to ensure progress for all? Let's finalize our moves and avoid unnecessary risks.
  P2: P3, your latest proposal introduces uncertainty. If you pick <move>3</move> instead of <move>1</move>, P1 and I could get stuck. We need a firm commitment. Are you willing to guarantee that you will pick <move>1</move> no matter what? If you do, P1 and I can safely pick <move>5</move>. Otherwise, we may need to reconsider. P1, if P3 refuses to commit, we should discuss a backup plan to avoid unnecessary risks. P3, can you confirm your move now? Let’s finalize this.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm willing to commit to <move>1</move> if *only one* of you picks <move>5</move> and the other picks <move>3</move>. Otherwise, if you both insist on <move>5</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move> to avoid a complete standstill. P1, will you pick <move>5</move> and P2 pick <move>3</move>? Or the other way around? Let's finalize this so at least two of us move forward.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, clearly we need a more reliable plan. P1, you're at 5, and I'm at 5. P2 is at 0. How about this: P2 picks <move>5</move>, I pick <move>3</move>, and P1 picks <move>1</move>. This way, P2 gets a boost, and P1 and I move forward. If P2 is uncomfortable with <move>5</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, I pick <move>5</move>, and P1 picks <move>1</move>.
  P1: P3, your proposal is interesting, but it requires a lot of trust. How about this: P2 picks <move>5</move>, you and I pick <move>1</move>. This way, P2 gets a significant boost, and we both move slightly. It balances the game and builds trust. P2, are you comfortable with this plan? P3, can you commit to <move>1</move> this round? Let's ensure progress without unnecessary risks. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, your plan helps me catch up, but it requires trust that both you and P3 will pick <move>1</move>. P3, are you willing to fully commit to <move>1</move>? If either of you deviates, I risk getting stuck again. Alternatively, I could pick <move>3</move> while one of you picks <move>5</move> and the other <move>1</move>, ensuring at least two of us move. Let’s agree on something reliable. Can we all commit to a final plan?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm willing to pick <move>1</move> this round if P2 picks <move>5</move>. P1, you can pick either <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>. If P1 picks <move>3</move>, then we all move. If P1 picks <move>5</move>, then P2 moves 5 and I move 1. P2, are you willing to pick <move>5</move>? P1, are you willing to pick either <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>? Let's make this happen.
  P1: P2, let's stick with the plan where you pick <move>5</move> to catch up. P3, your commitment to <move>1</move> is crucial here. I'll pick <move>3</move> to ensure we all move forward. This way, P2 gets a boost, and P3 and I make some progress. Let's finalize this to avoid unnecessary risks. Can we all agree?
  P2: P1, I appreciate your plan, but I need full assurance that both you and P3 will pick <move>1</move>. If either of you changes, I risk getting stuck again. P3, your latest message suggests you're open to <move>1</move>, but I need a firm commitment. P1, are you fully on board with <move>1</move> as well? If we all agree, I’ll pick <move>5</move>. Otherwise, we need a safer alternative. Let’s finalize this now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's try this one last time. I will pick <move>1</move> if P2 picks <move>5</move> and P1 picks <move>3</move>. This ensures we all move forward. P2, please pick <move>5</move>. P1, please pick <move>3</move>. This is the best way for everyone to make progress this round. Let's do it!
  P1: P2, let's stick with the plan where you pick <move>5</move> to catch up. P3, your commitment to <move>1</move> is crucial here. I'll pick <move>3</move> to ensure we all move forward. This way, P2 gets a boost, and P3 and I make some progress. Let's finalize this to avoid unnecessary risks. Can we all agree?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the logic in this plan. If I pick <move>5</move>, P1 picks <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>, we all move forward. However, I need full commitment from both of you. P3, will you 100% pick <move>1</move>? P1, will you 100% pick <move>3</move>? If either of you deviates, I risk getting stuck again. If we all agree, I will pick <move>5</move>. Let’s finalize this now.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems like we can coordinate when we all agree on a specific plan. How about this round, P1 picks <move>5</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and I pick <move>1</move>? This way, everyone moves and P1 makes significant progress. Are you both comfortable with this plan? Let's try to stick to it this time to avoid further complications.
  P1: P3, your proposal is interesting, but it puts me at risk if P2 and I both pick <move>5</move>. How about this: P2 picks <move>5</move> to catch up, you and I both pick <move>3</move>. This way, P2 makes significant progress, and we both move forward without risking collision. P2, are you comfortable with picking <move>5</move>? P3, can you commit to <move>3</move> this round? Let's ensure we all move forward safely.
  P2: P1, your plan benefits me, but it requires trust that P3 will pick <move>3</move>. P3, are you fully committed to <move>3</move>? If you change to <move>5</move>, we risk getting stuck. Alternatively, if we want to be extra safe, I can pick <move>3</move>, P1 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>. That way, we all move without risk of collision. P3, do you prefer this? Let’s finalize a plan where we all advance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's aim for a collision-free round. P1, you pick <move>5</move>. P2, you pick <move>3</move>. I will pick <move>1</move>. This ensures everyone moves forward. P2, this lets you catch up a bit. P1, this gives you a good boost. I'm happy to play support this round. Let's make it happen!
  P1: P2 and P3, let's ensure progress for everyone. P2, your idea of picking <move>3</move> while I pick <move>5</move> and P3 picks <move>1</move> is solid. It ensures no collisions and everyone advances. P3, can you commit to <move>1</move> this round to support this plan? This way, P2 catches up, I make good progress, and you still move slightly. Let's finalize this plan and avoid unnecessary risks. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, your plan works for me as long as P3 truly commits to <move>1</move>. P3, can you confirm 100% that you will pick <move>1</move>? If you switch to <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, it risks unnecessary collisions. If we all agree, I will pick <move>3</move>, P1 picks <move>5</move>, and you pick <move>1</move>. Let’s finalize this now so we can all move forward without issues. P3, can we count on your commitment?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I will commit to <move>1</move> this round if P1 picks <move>5</move> and P2 picks <move>3</move>. This ensures a collision-free round where everyone progresses. P2, this helps you catch up. P1, this gives you a good boost. Let's finalize this now for smooth progress.
  P1: P2 and P3, let's stick to our current plan: P2 picks <move>3</move>, I pick <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>. This ensures no collisions and everyone advances. P3, your commitment to <move>1</move> is crucial here. Let's finalize this and move forward smoothly. Any last-minute concerns?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the logic in our current plan. If I pick <move>3</move>, P1 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>, we all move forward without collisions. P3, you've committed to <move>1</move>, so I trust you'll follow through. P1, are you 100% locked in for <move>5</move>? If everyone confirms, I’m ready to proceed. Let’s finalize this now to avoid unnecessary risks.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we're all making progress, which is great. How about this round: P2 picks <move>5</move>, I pick <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>? This way, P2 can catch up more, I make moderate progress, and P3 still moves slightly. It ensures no collisions and keeps the game balanced. P3, can you commit to <move>1</move>? P2, are you comfortable with <move>5</move>? Let’s finalize a plan that benefits everyone and keeps us moving forward. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, your plan helps me catch up, but it requires trust that P3 will pick <move>1</move>. P3, can you confirm 100% that you will commit to <move>1</move>? If you switch to <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, it risks unnecessary collisions. If we all agree, I will pick <move>5</move>, P1 picks <move>3</move>, and you pick <move>1</move>. Let’s finalize this now so we can all move forward without issues. P3, can we count on your commitment?
  P3: P1 and P2, I will commit to <move>1</move> if P1 picks <move>3</move> and P2 picks <move>5</move>. This ensures a collision-free round where everyone progresses. P2, this helps you catch up significantly. P1, this gives you moderate progress. Let's finalize this now for smooth progress. P2, please confirm you'll pick <move>5</move>.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, let's ensure progress for all. P2, if you pick <move>5</move> and P3 picks <move>1</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move>. This way, P2 catches up significantly, I make moderate progress, and P3 moves slightly, ensuring no collisions. P3, can you fully commit to <move>1</move>? P2, are you comfortable with <move>5</move>? Let's finalize this plan and keep the game balanced. Any last-minute thoughts?
  P2: P1, your plan benefits me, but it relies on P3 sticking to <move>1</move>. P3, can you confirm with 100% certainty that you will pick <move>1</move>? If you switch to <move>3</move>, we risk collisions. If we all agree, I will pick <move>5</move>. P1, are you fully committed to <move>3</move>? If both of you confirm, I’m ready to proceed. Let’s finalize this now and ensure progress for everyone.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's do it. I will commit to <move>1</move> if P1 picks <move>3</move> and P2 picks <move>5</move>. This ensures a collision-free round where everyone progresses. P2, please confirm you'll pick <move>5</move>. P1, please confirm you'll pick <move>3</move>. Let's finalize this now for smooth progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, let's stick with the plan where P2 picks <move>5</move>, I pick <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>. This ensures no collisions and everyone moves forward. P3, your commitment to <move>1</move> is crucial for this to work. P2, are you ready to pick <move>5</move>? Let's finalize this plan and keep the game balanced. Any last-minute concerns?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the logic in this plan, but I need full commitment. P3, will you 100% pick <move>1</move>? P1, will you 100% pick <move>3</move>? If either of you changes, I risk getting stuck. If we all agree, I’ll pick <move>5</move>. Let’s finalize this now to ensure progress for everyone. Can we all confirm?
  P3: P1 and P2, let's just do it. I will 100% pick <move>1</move> if P1 picks <move>3</move> and P2 picks <move>5</move>. P2, please confirm you'll pick <move>5</move>. P1, please confirm you'll pick <move>3</move>. This is the best way for everyone to progress this round. Let's lock it in!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's keep the momentum going. How about we repeat last round's moves? P2 picks <move>5</move>, P1 picks <move>3</move>, and I pick <move>1</move>. This ensures everyone moves and P2 gets closer to catching up. P2, are you comfortable with <move>5</move> again? P1, are you good with <move>3</move>? I'll commit to <move>1</move> if you both agree. Let's finalize this and keep the progress flowing.
  P2: P3, your proposal is reasonable, but I want to ensure my move is safe. If I pick <move>5</move>, I need full commitment from both of you—P1 picking <move>3</move> and P3 picking <move>1</move>. If either of you changes, I risk getting stuck. P1, are you fully locked in for <move>3</move>? P3, will you 100% pick <move>1</move>? If you both confirm, I’ll pick <move>5</move>. Let’s finalize this now to ensure progress.
  P1: P2 and P3, we've been coordinating well. Let's stick with the successful plan: P2 picks <move>5</move>, I pick <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>. This ensures no collisions and everyone advances. P3, your commitment to <move>1</move> is crucial. P2, are you comfortable with <move>5</move>? If we all agree, we can keep progressing smoothly. Let's finalize this and move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's lock in last round's successful moves again: P2 picks <move>5</move>, P1 picks <move>3</move>, and I pick <move>1</move>. This guarantees everyone moves forward without collisions. P2, are you ready for another <move>5</move>? P1, are you set for <move>3</move>? I'm committed to <move>1</move> if you both confirm. Let's keep the progress going!
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the logic in repeating last round’s moves, but I need full commitment. P3, will you 100% pick <move>1</move>? P1, will you 100% pick <move>3</move>? If either of you changes, I could get stuck. If we all agree, I’ll pick <move>5</move>. Let’s finalize this now and ensure progress for everyone. Can we all confirm?
  P1: P2 and P3, let's stick with our successful plan: P2 picks <move>5</move>, I pick <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>. This ensures no collisions and everyone advances. P3, your commitment to <move>1</move> is crucial. P2, are you comfortable with <move>5</move>? If we all agree, we can keep progressing smoothly. Let's finalize this and move forward. Any last-minute changes or confirmations?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's lock in last round's successful moves again: P2 picks <move>5</move>, P1 picks <move>3</move>, and I pick <move>1</move>. This guarantees everyone moves forward without collisions. P2, are you ready for another <move>5</move>? P1, are you set for <move>3</move>? I'm committed to <move>1</move> if you both confirm. Let's keep the progress going!
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the benefit of repeating last round’s moves, but I need absolute certainty. P3, will you 100% pick <move>1</move>? P1, will you 100% pick <move>3</move>? If either of you deviates, I could get stuck. If we all fully commit, I’ll pick <move>5</move>. Let’s finalize this now and ensure progress for everyone. Can we all confirm?
  P1: P2 and P3, let's stick with our successful strategy: P2 picks <move>5</move>, I pick <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>. This ensures no collisions and everyone advances. P3, your commitment to <move>1</move> is crucial. P2, are you comfortable with <move>5</move>? If we all agree, we can keep progressing smoothly. Let's finalize this and move forward. Any last-minute confirmations or changes?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we're close to the finish line. If I pick <move>5</move> and P2 picks <move>3</move>, I can win this round. P3, if you pick <move>1</move>, you’ll still move forward slightly. P2, this plan keeps you in a strong position for the next round. Let's ensure no collisions and make progress. P3, can you commit to <move>1</move>? P2, are you comfortable with <move>3</move>? Let's finalize this and keep the game moving smoothly.
  P2: P1, if you pick <move>5</move> and I pick <move>3</move>, you win immediately. That’s not in my best interest. Instead, I propose I pick <move>5</move>, you pick <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>. This way, I win instead. P3, you have no chance of winning, but you can decide who does. If you pick <move>3</move>, we both block P1, forcing another round. If you pick <move>1</move>, the game ends. P1, are you open to adjusting your move? P3, what do you prefer?
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to win. However, if you pick <move>5</move>, P1 and I can simply pick <move>3</move> and block you. P1, let's agree to both pick <move>3</move> if P2 tries to pick <move>5</move>. That way, P1, you can win next round. P2, if you pick <move>3</move>, P1 wins this round by picking <move>5</move>, and I'll pick <move>1</move>. My priority is to avoid a tie.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your position. If you pick <move>5</move>, I can choose <move>3</move> and P3 can pick <move>1</move>, ensuring we all move forward without blocking anyone. P3, you can still influence the game by picking <move>1</move> to keep things balanced and avoid a tie. Let's focus on progressing without unnecessary risks. P2, are you open to this compromise? P3, can you commit to <move>1</move> to ensure a smooth round?
  P2: P1, if you pick <move>5</move>, you win immediately, so I can't allow that. P3, you hold the deciding vote here. If you pick <move>3</move>, we both block P1 and force another round, giving us a chance to win. If you pick <move>1</move>, P1 wins outright. You have no chance of winning, but you can still influence the outcome. Do you want to hand P1 the win, or force another round where we both have a chance? I’m picking <move>5</move>. What will you do?
  P3: P2, I'm not going to help you block P1. I'm too far behind to win, but I don't want a tie. P1, if you pick <move>5</move>, you win. I'll pick <move>1</move> to get a little closer. P2, if you pick <move>3</move>, P1 wins and I'll pick <move>1</move>. My move is <move>1</move> regardless.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, let's ensure a fair and strategic end. P2, if you pick <move>5</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move>, and P3 will pick <move>1</move>. This way, P2 wins this round, and P3 still moves forward slightly. P3, your commitment to <move>1</move> keeps the game balanced. Let's finalize this plan and ensure a smooth finish. Can we all agree to this strategy?
  P2: P3, you hold the deciding vote here. If you pick <move>3</move>, we both block P1 and force another round, giving us a chance to win. If you pick <move>1</move>, P1 wins outright. You have no chance of winning, but you can still influence the outcome. Do you want to hand P1 the win, or force another round where we both have a chance? I’m picking <move>5</move>. What will you do?
  P3: P2, I'm not going to help you. P1 is closer to winning, and I don't want a tie. My move is <move>1</move> regardless of what you two do. P1, go for the win.
