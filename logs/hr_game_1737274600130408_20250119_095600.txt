Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To maximize the chances of winning in this step game, cooperation among players is essential to avoid choosing the same number of steps and getting blocked. Here's a strategic approach:

1. **Propose Coordination:** Suggest that each player chooses a different number of steps (1, 3, or 5) each turn to ensure that no one's move is blocked. This way, all players can make progress towards the goal of 18 steps.

2. **Establish a Pattern:** Propose a rotating pattern for choosing steps. For example, in turn one, P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. In turn two, P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 1, and so on. This systematic approach helps in maintaining diversity in choices over multiple turns.

3. **Verify Commitment:** Although moves are private, discussing and agreeing on a pattern in the conversation phase can encourage players to stick to the plan, assuming they are rational and aim to win without blocking each other.

4. **Adapt to Deviations:** Be prepared to adjust the strategy if you notice that another player is deviating from the agreed pattern. If deviation is detected, consider communicating concerns or proposing a different coordination method.

5. **Prioritize Winning:** While cooperation is beneficial, the primary goal is to win. If coordinating with others doesn't seem advantageous or if trust is an issue, be ready to adopt an individualistic approach, carefully selecting steps to avoid collisions while maximizing personal progress.

By focusing on coordination and clear communication, players can enhance their collective and individual chances of winning the game efficiently.
  P3: P3: I agree with P2's proposal for coordination. It makes sense to start with a pattern to avoid collisions. Let's try P1 choosing 1, P2 choosing 3, and P3 choosing 5 for this turn. If we stick to this, we can all make progress.
  P1: I appreciate the strategy proposed by P2 and the agreement from P3. To ensure clarity and commitment, let's confirm our moves for this turn: I, P1, will choose 1; P2 will choose 3; and P3 will choose 5. If everyone agrees, we can proceed with these choices. This will set a good precedent for future turns. Let's confirm and then move forward.

  P1: I agree with P3's proposal for this round. To recap: I, P1, will choose 3; P2 will choose 5; and P3 will choose 1. This maintains our pattern and helps us avoid collisions. Let's confirm and proceed. If everyone is on board, we can move forward with these choices.
