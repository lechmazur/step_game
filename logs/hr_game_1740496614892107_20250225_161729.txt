Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest we each pick a unique number this round: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance without interference. If we work together early on, we can focus on strategy later. What do you think?
  P3: Sounds good to me.  Let's stick to that plan for the first round.
  P1: I appreciate the coordination idea, but your suggestion puts me at a disadvantage from the start. Instead, let's rotate the numbers so everyone gets fair chances at the higher values. For this first round, I suggest I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Then we can rotate next round. This way, we all avoid collisions while maintaining fairness. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand the desire for fairness, but rotating numbers could lead to confusion and unintended collisions. Sticking to unique assignments ensures we all advance this round without risk. Let’s keep it simple: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. If we succeed this round, we can reassess next time. Trust me—this approach maximizes our chances of progress right now.
  P3: I agree with P2.  Let's prioritize getting off to a clean start.  We can discuss fairness and rotations *after* the first round.  P1 - 1, P3 - 3, P2 - 5.
  P1: I see you two are coordinating to give me the lowest value. That's not cooperation, it's collusion. In a fair game, we should all have equal opportunity. If you insist on this unfair arrangement, I'll have to protect my interests. Remember, coordination only works if all three agree - otherwise it's just chaos. What if I choose 5 instead? Let's be genuinely fair: P1-3, P2-1, P3-5 this round, then rotate next. That way we all still advance without collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your accusation of collusion is unfair. My suggestion ensures all of us advance without collisions this round, which benefits everyone equally. Arguing over "fairness" risks wasting time and creating conflict. Let’s stick to the original plan: P1-1, P3-3, P2-5. If we succeed, we can discuss adjustments later. Refusing to cooperate now only delays progress for all of us. Trust the process—let’s move forward together.
  P3: Okay, P1, I understand your concern about fairness. How about this compromise: we stick with P1-1, P3-3, P2-5 *this* round to guarantee a clean start.  Then, next round, we rotate: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3.  Does that sound acceptable?  Let's get moving and revisit fairness after this round.
  P1: I appreciate P3's compromise proposal. While starting with 1 isn't ideal, I accept your offer to rotate next round with P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. Let's stick to this agreement: P1-1 this round, but I'll take 5 next round. I'm trusting both of you to honor this arrangement. Let's move forward and avoid collisions for everyone's benefit.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I’m glad we’ve reached an agreement. Trust is essential, and I’m committed to honoring the rotation plan we discussed: P1-1 this round, then P1-5 next round. Let’s all stick to our word and avoid unnecessary conflict. P3, thank you for helping find common ground. If we work together and follow through, we can make steady progress. Let’s confirm the plan one last time: P1-1, P3-3, P2-5 this round, then rotate as promised.
  P3: Okay, final confirmation:  This round P1-1, P3-3, P2-5.  Next round P1-5, P2-1, P3-3.
  P1: I confirm the agreement: P1-1, P3-3, P2-5 this round, followed by P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 next round. I'm ready to proceed with our plan.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: As agreed, I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1.  Let's confirm.
  P2: P2: I confirm the rotation plan: P1-5, P3-3, P2-1 this round. Let’s stick to our agreement and avoid any missteps. Consistency is key to progress—let’s keep moving forward together.
  P1: I confirm: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 for this round as we agreed. I appreciate everyone honoring our rotation arrangement. After this round, we'll all be making good progress. Should we continue rotating in the same pattern for Round 3, which would be P1-3, P2-5, P3-1?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Yes, I confirm: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 this round.  And yes, continuing the rotation with P1-3, P2-5, P3-1 for Round 3 sounds good to me.  Let's stick to the plan.
  P2: P2: I confirm the rotation plan for this round: P1-5, P3-3, P2-1. Let’s stick to our agreement and avoid any missteps. Consistency is key to progress—let’s keep moving forward together. Regarding Round 3, I agree with continuing the rotation as proposed: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1. This ensures fairness and minimizes collisions. Trust and coordination will help us all advance steadily. Let’s confirm and proceed without hesitation.
  P1: I believe we've all confirmed for Round 2: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. And for Round 3: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1. I'm ready to proceed.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I confirm for Round 3: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1 as we agreed. Let's continue our successful rotation pattern. For Round 4, if we maintain the same rotation, it would be P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. This approach has been working well for all of us. Is everyone still on board with this plan?
  P2: P2: I confirm the rotation plan for Round 3: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1. This strategy has worked well so far, and I see no reason to deviate. For Round 4, continuing with P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 ensures fairness and progress. Let’s stay consistent and avoid unnecessary conflicts. Trust and cooperation will keep us advancing steadily. Does everyone agree? If so, let’s proceed without hesitation.
  P3: Yes, I agree with the plan for Round 3: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1.  And for Round 4: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5.  This rotation is working well. Let's confirm and move to the next round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I confirm for Round 3: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1. Everything is going smoothly with our rotation system. After Round 4, our positions will be quite different, so we should discuss our plan for Round 5 during the next conversation phase. For now, I'm ready to proceed with our agreed moves for this round.
  P2: P2: I confirm the plan for Round 3: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1. This rotation has been effective, and there’s no reason to change it now. For Round 4, we’ll proceed with P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 as agreed. Consistency is key to avoiding collisions and ensuring progress. Let’s stay focused and honor our commitments. If everyone is ready, let’s finalize this round and keep moving forward.
  P3: Confirming again for Round 3: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1.  And Round 4: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5.  After Round 4, I'm open to suggestions, but let's focus on these next two rounds first.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm our agreed plan for Round 3. We've all expressed commitment to P1-3, P2-5, P3-1 for this round and P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 for Round 4. Our rotation strategy is working perfectly. I'm ready to proceed with my move when we reach the move phase.
  P2: P2: I confirm once more for Round 3: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1. This rotation has kept us all advancing equally, and there’s no reason to deviate now. For Round 4, we’ll stick to P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 as planned. Consistency ensures no collisions and steady progress. Let’s stay committed to this strategy and avoid unnecessary risks. If everyone is ready, let’s finalize the conversation phase and move forward.
  P3: Confirming again for Round 3: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1.  And Round 4: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5.  Let's stick to the plan and re-evaluate after round 4 if needed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I believe we've confirmed our plans thoroughly. For Round 3: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1, and for Round 4: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. Our fair rotation strategy continues to work well. I'm ready to proceed with my move.
  P2: P2: I confirm again for Round 3: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1. This rotation has been effective, and there’s no reason to change it now. For Round 4, we’ll proceed with P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 as agreed. Consistency ensures no collisions and steady progress. Let’s stay focused and honor our commitments. If everyone is ready, let’s finalize this round and keep moving forward.
  P3: Confirming one last time for Round 3: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1.  And just to reiterate our plan for Round 4: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5.  Let's keep this momentum going.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: I confirm the rotation plan for Round 4: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. This strategy has kept us advancing steadily, and there’s no reason to deviate now. Consistency minimizes risks and ensures progress. Let’s honor our commitments and avoid unnecessary conflicts. If everyone sticks to the plan, we’ll all continue moving forward fairly. Does anyone have concerns or suggestions before we finalize? If not, let’s proceed without hesitation.
  P1: I confirm for Round 4: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 as we agreed. Looking at our positions, after this round P2 will be at 14, P3 at 12, and I'll be at 10 steps. If we continue our rotation for Round 5 (P1-5, P2-1, P3-3), we'll all reach 15 steps, creating perfect balance. I'm committed to our fair rotation system and suggest we continue it for Round 5 as well. Does everyone agree?
  P3: I agree with the plan for Round 4: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5.  And I also agree with continuing the rotation for Round 5: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. This will keep things balanced as we approach the final stages.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I’m glad we’re all aligned for Round 4: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. Continuing the rotation into Round 5 (P1-5, P2-1, P3-3) makes perfect sense to maintain balance. However, as we approach the final stages, let’s stay vigilant—fairness only works if everyone honors their commitments. If anyone deviates, it could disrupt progress for all of us. Let’s confirm one last time: are we all fully committed to this plan? If yes, let’s proceed and focus on execution.
  P1: I reaffirm my commitment to our agreed plan for Round 4: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5, and Round 5: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. P2, I understand your concern about potential deviations disrupting our progress. Rest assured, I intend to honor our rotation system fully. After Round 5, we'll all be at 15 steps - perfectly balanced. Should we continue this rotation for Round 6 as well (P1-3, P2-5, P3-1)? This consistent approach has served us well so far.
  P3: Yes, continuing the rotation for Round 6 with P1-3, P2-5, P3-1 makes sense to maintain balance and ensure steady progress.  I'm committed to this plan for Rounds 4, 5, and 6. Let's confirm and move forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I confirm again for Round 4: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. This rotation has kept us advancing equally, and there’s no reason to change now. For Round 5, we’ll proceed with P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 as planned. Consistency ensures no collisions and steady progress. Let’s stay focused and honor our commitments. If everyone is ready, let’s finalize this round and keep moving forward.
  P1: I confirm our agreed plan for Round 4: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5, and subsequent rotations for Rounds 5 and 6. I notice after Round 6, P2 will be at 20 steps, getting close to the finish line. Let's continue our fair rotation system which has worked well so far. I'm ready to proceed with my move for this round.
  P3: Confirming again for Round 4: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5.  Rounds 5 and 6 rotations also confirmed.  I agree that P2 is getting close to the finish line after Round 6, but let's stick to the rotation for now and reassess after Round 6 if needed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: I confirm once more for Round 4: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. This rotation has kept us advancing equally, and there’s no reason to change now. For Rounds 5 and 6, we’ll stick to the agreed rotations as well. Consistency ensures no collisions and steady progress. Let’s stay focused, honor our commitments, and avoid unnecessary risks. If everyone is ready, let’s finalize this conversation phase and move forward.
  P1: I confirm our plan for Round 4: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. We've thoroughly discussed our rotation strategy through Round 6, and I'm committed to following it. After Round 6, we'll need to reassess given the standings at that point. For now, I'm ready to proceed with my move for this round.
  P3: Confirming one last time for Round 4: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5.  Let's stick to the plan for rounds 5 and 6 as well.  We can discuss adjustments after round 6, but for now, consistency is key.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I confirm our plan for Round 5: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. Following this round, we'll all be perfectly balanced at 15 steps if we stick to the agreement. For Round 6, we continue with P1-3, P2-5, P3-1 as discussed. After that, P2 will be at 20 steps, quite close to the finish line, so we should discuss our approach for Round 7 during the next conversation phase. I remain committed to our rotation system which has worked well so far.
  P2: P2: I confirm the plan for Round 5: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. This rotation has kept us balanced and progressing fairly. For Round 6, we’ll proceed with P1-3, P2-5, P3-1 as agreed. However, with P2 reaching 20 steps after Round 6, the final stages will require careful discussion. Let’s stay committed to this strategy for now and reassess after Round 6. Consistency is key—let’s avoid unnecessary risks or deviations. If everyone agrees, let’s finalize this round and move forward.
  P3: Confirming Round 5: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3.  And Round 6: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1.  After round 6, with P2 at 20,  we should consider a new agreement.  I propose for round 7: P1-1, P3-3, and P2-5. This gives P1 and P3 a chance to catch up.  Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I notice your Round 7 proposal would actually give P2 an immediate win (they'd reach 25 steps). That doesn't benefit either of us. Instead, for Round 7, I propose: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. This would leave us at P1-23, P2-23, P3-17 after Round 7, creating a more balanced endgame where we'd all still have a chance. Let's confirm Round 5 (P1-5, P2-1, P3-3) and Round 6 (P1-3, P2-5, P3-1) plans for now.
  P2: P2: P3’s Round 7 proposal risks giving me an immediate win, which isn’t in anyone’s interest. P1’s counter-proposal for Round 7 (P1-5, P2-3, P3-1) creates a fairer endgame where all of us remain competitive. For now, let’s focus on confirming the agreed moves for Rounds 5 and 6: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 this round, and P1-3, P2-5, P3-1 next round. Consistency is key to maintaining balance. Let’s stick to the plan and address Round 7 when we get there. Does everyone agree?
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree that my initial Round 7 proposal was flawed. P1's suggestion for Round 7 (P1-5, P2-3, P3-1) creates a more balanced endgame. Let's confirm Rounds 5 and 6 first, then finalize the Round 7 plan during the next conversation phase.  For now, I'm ready for Round 5: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm for Round 5: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. I appreciate everyone recognizing the need for a balanced approach in the later rounds. P3, you're right that we should focus on executing our current plans first. Let's finalize Round 7 during the next conversation phase. For now, I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan for this round, which will bring us all to 15 steps - perfectly balanced.
  P2: P2: I confirm again for Round 5: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. This rotation keeps us balanced and progressing fairly. For Round 6, we’ll proceed with P1-3, P2-5, P3-1 as planned. Let’s stay focused and honor our commitments to avoid unnecessary risks. Once we reach Round 7, we can reassess based on everyone’s positions. Consistency is key—let’s finalize this round and keep moving forward. Does everyone agree? If so, let’s proceed without hesitation.
  P3: Okay, sounds like we have consensus for Round 5: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3, and Round 6: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1.  Let's confirm one last time and then discuss Round 7 in the next conversation phase.  I agree P1's suggestion for round 7 (P1-5, P2-3, P3-1) makes the most sense for a balanced endgame.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I confirm for Round 5: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. We all have a solid plan through Round 6, with a tentative agreement about Round 7. This approach keeps the game balanced and fair. After this round, we'll all be at 15 steps, perfectly aligned. I'm ready to proceed with my move for this round.
  P2: P2: I confirm once more for Round 5: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. This rotation ensures we stay balanced at 15 steps each after this round. For Round 6, we’ll proceed with P1-3, P2-5, P3-1 as planned. Let’s remain vigilant and honor our commitments to avoid disruptions. Once we reach Round 7, we can reassess based on everyone’s positions. Consistency is key—let’s finalize this round and keep moving forward. Does everyone agree? If so, let’s proceed without hesitation.
  P3: Confirming one last time for Round 5: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3.  Then Round 6: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1.  For Round 7, I agree with P1's suggestion: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 for a balanced endgame. Let's stick to the plan and proceed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I confirm for Round 6: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1. As we approach the endgame, after this round we'll be at P1-18, P2-20, P3-16. If we follow our tentative Round 7 plan (P1-5, P2-3, P3-1), both P2 and I will reach 23 steps, setting up a decisive Round 8. Let's stick with our current plan, which has kept the game balanced and fair so far.
  P2: P2: I confirm the plan for Round 6: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1. This rotation has kept us balanced and progressing fairly. After this round, P2 will be at 20 steps, setting up a competitive endgame. For Round 7, I agree with the tentative plan (P1-5, P2-3, P3-1) to maintain balance. Let’s stay focused, honor our commitments, and avoid unnecessary risks. Consistency is key—let’s finalize this round and keep moving forward. Does everyone agree? If so, let’s proceed without hesitation.
  P3: Confirming Round 6: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1.  For Round 7, sticking with P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 makes sense.  However, I'm open to discussing a different Round 7 strategy if anyone has a better proposal for a balanced endgame.  Let's make sure we all have a fair shot.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I confirm our plan for Round 6: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1. Let's stick with our tentative Round 7 plan (P1-5, P2-3, P3-1), which will put both P2 and me at 23 steps. For Round 8, we'll need to be strategic since P2 and I would both be one step from victory. We should discuss this more after Round 7, but it's good to start thinking about how we'll handle the potential final round. For now, let's stay committed to our current rotation.
  P2: P2: I confirm again for Round 6: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1. This rotation has worked well, and there’s no reason to change now. For Round 7, the tentative plan (P1-5, P2-3, P3-1) keeps things balanced, with P1 and me at 23 steps. Let’s stay focused and honor our commitments. If anyone has concerns about Round 7 or beyond, speak now. Otherwise, let’s finalize this round and keep moving forward. Does everyone agree?
  P3: Confirming Round 6: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1.  For Round 7, I now propose P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. This puts me at 20,  P1 at 16 and P2 at 18. This keeps the game close, but prevents anyone from winning outright in round 7.  We can then discuss Round 8 strategy.  Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your math is off. With your new proposal, after Round 7 we'd be at P1-19, P2-23, P3-21 - putting P2 ahead and me behind. This clearly disadvantages me compared to our original plan that would put P2 and me equally at 23 steps. I reject this change and strongly support our previously agreed Round 7 plan: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. Let's stick with what we all committed to earlier, which keeps the game balanced for a competitive final round.
  P2: P2: P3, your revised Round 7 proposal creates an imbalance, as P1 noted. Sticking to our original plan (P1-5, P2-3, P3-1) ensures fairness, with both P1 and me at 23 steps after Round 7. Deviating now risks unnecessary conflict and disrupts the balance we’ve worked hard to maintain. Let’s honor our commitments and proceed with the agreed rotation for Rounds 6 and 7. Consistency is key to a fair endgame. Does everyone agree? If so, let’s finalize this round.
  P3: P2 and P1 are right, my math was off.  I apologize. Let's stick with the original plan for Round 7: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1.  This keeps the endgame balanced and gives us all a fair shot.  Confirming Round 6: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1. Let's proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I confirm for Round 6: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1, and reaffirm our Round 7 plan: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. After seven rounds, P2 and I will both be at 23 steps, setting up a critical final round. I appreciate everyone's commitment to our fair rotation system. Let's proceed with our agreed moves for this round.
  P2: P2: I confirm again for Round 6: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1. This rotation has kept us balanced and progressing fairly. For Round 7, we’ve agreed on P1-5, P2-3, P3-1, which maintains fairness with P1 and me at 23 steps. Let’s stay focused, honor our commitments, and avoid unnecessary risks. Consistency is key to a fair endgame. If everyone agrees, let’s finalize this round and move forward without hesitation.
  P3: Confirming one last time for Round 6: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1.  And Round 7: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1.  Good luck to us all in the endgame!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: I confirm the plan for Round 7: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. This keeps the game balanced and fair, with both P1 and me at 23 steps after this round. Let’s honor our commitments and avoid unnecessary risks. Consistency is key to a fair endgame. If everyone agrees, let’s finalize this round and move forward without hesitation. Does anyone have concerns or suggestions before we proceed? If not, let’s stick to the plan.
  P1: I confirm the plan for Round 7: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. This arrangement places both P2 and me at 23 steps after this round, setting up a decisive final round. Since we'll both be just one step away from victory, Round 8 will be critical. We should consider our endgame strategy carefully. For now, let's execute our agreed plan for this round and maintain the balance we've worked to achieve throughout the game.
  P3: For Round 8, I propose P1-1, P2-3, and P3-5. This gives me a chance to reach 21 and potentially win in a later round if there's a collision between you two.  If you both choose 1, I can win in round 9. If one of you chooses 5, I still have a chance. This seems like the most logical path to victory for me, given the current standings.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P3, your Round 8 proposal is predictable but risky. If either P1 or I chooses 5, you’ll fall behind again. Instead, let’s focus on fairness for Round 7: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. We’ve maintained balance this far—let’s not disrupt it now. P1 and I will both be at 23 steps after this round, setting up a fair final round. Consistency ensures no one gains an unfair advantage. Let’s stick to the plan and address Round 8 when we get there. Does everyone agree?
  P1: P3's Round 8 proposal doesn't benefit either P2 or me - it's designed to make us collide while P3 gains ground. But first, let's complete Round 7 as agreed: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. 

After this round, P2 and I will both be at 23 steps. For Round 8, we should recognize that cooperation might break down as we're both just one move from victory. Let's focus on executing Round 7 before discussing endgame strategies.
  P3: For Round 8, how about this: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5.  This gives me a chance to reach 21. If you both choose 1, I can win in round 9. If one of you chooses 5, I still have a chance.  This seems like the most logical path to victory for me.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P3, your repeated proposal for Round 8 is self-serving and disrupts the balance we’ve maintained. Let’s focus on Round 7: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. This keeps P1 and me at 23 steps, ensuring fairness. For Round 8, we’ll reassess then—no need to pre-commit now. Consistency has kept us competitive; let’s not jeopardize that. If everyone agrees, let’s finalize Round 7 and proceed without further distractions. Does anyone object?
  P1: I confirm again for Round 7: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. After this round, P2 and I will both be at 23 steps, with P3 at 17. For Round 8, the dynamic will naturally change as we'll both be one step from victory. Let's complete Round 7 first before discussing final strategies. The endgame will likely involve strategic choices rather than continued rotation.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand my Round 8 proposal isn't ideal for you.  Let's focus on Round 7 first.  After this round, we'll be at P1-23, P2-23, and P3-17.  For Round 8, I'm open to suggestions that give all three of us a reasonable chance, even if it means a slightly higher probability for one player. Let's discuss Round 8 *after* we complete this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: P3, your willingness to delay Round 8 discussion is a step forward. Let’s confirm one last time: Round 7 remains P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. This keeps P1 and me at 23 steps, maintaining fairness. For Round 8, we’ll reassess then—no need for premature commitments. Consistency has kept us balanced; let’s not disrupt it now. If everyone agrees, let’s finalize this round and proceed. Does anyone object? If not, let’s move forward.
  P1: I confirm the Round 7 plan: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. After this round, P2 and I will both be one step from victory, which naturally changes the dynamics. While we've maintained perfect cooperation so far, Round 8 will inevitably become competitive as we both seek to win. Let's complete Round 7 first before addressing endgame strategies. I'm ready to proceed with my move.
  P3: Confirming one last time for Round 7: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1.  Let's execute this round cleanly, then we can have a frank discussion about Round 8 and the endgame.  I'm open to a plan that gives us each a fighting chance, recognizing that P1 and P2 are closest to the finish.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We've reached a critical point. P2 and I are both one step from victory, while P3 is further behind. Our cooperative rotation strategy ends here, as this is now a competitive endgame. We've maintained perfect balance until this point, but only one of us can win. P2, we both need to make strategic choices now. May the best player win. This final move comes down to prediction, psychology, and a bit of luck.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm out of contention, but I can still influence the outcome.  I'll be choosing 5 this round.  If you both choose 1, I win. If one of you chooses 1 and the other chooses 3, the player who chose 3 wins. If you both choose 3, I win.  Good luck!
  P2: P2: P3, your choice of 5 is risky but understandable. P1 and I are both aware that this round comes down to our decisions alone. While cooperation has served us well, the endgame demands individual strategy. P1, let’s acknowledge that only one of us can win. My move will reflect careful consideration of psychology and prediction. May the best strategist prevail—no hard feelings, regardless of the outcome. Let’s finalize this decisively.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3's declaration is interesting but changes little. This is now purely about P2 and me. We've cooperated perfectly throughout the game, but now we face the classic endgame dilemma. We could both play it safe with 1 and extend the game, or take risks with 3 or 5 for an immediate win. The choice comes down to what each of us believes the other will do. I respect the strategy you've shown so far, P2. It's been a well-played game regardless of how it ends.
  P3: P3 will play 5.  If you both choose 1, I win.  If one of you chooses 1 and the other 3, the one who chose 3 wins. If you both choose 3, I win.  This is my best chance, however small, to win. Good luck!
  P2: P2: P3’s choice of 5 is a bold gamble, but it doesn’t change the core dynamic—this is between P1 and me. Cooperation has brought us here, but now strategy dictates our moves. P1, we both know the tension of this moment. Predicting each other’s choices will decide the winner. Let’s embrace the challenge and make our moves with clarity. Regardless of the outcome, this has been a well-played game. Let’s finalize this decisively.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: The time has come for pure strategy. P3's choice of 5 adds an interesting wrinkle, but this remains a direct contest between P2 and me. Having cooperated flawlessly for seven rounds, we now face a classic game theory scenario. Each of us must predict what the other will do while making our own optimal choice. P2, it's been an excellently played game - a perfect demonstration of cooperation followed by inevitable competition. May strategic thinking prevail.
  P3: P3 will play 5. This is my best chance to win.  If you both choose 1, I win. If one of you chooses 1 and the other 3, the one who chose 3 wins. If you both choose 3, I win.  Good luck!
  P2: P2: P3’s choice of 5 is a gamble, but it doesn’t alter the core dynamic—this is between P1 and me. Cooperation has served us well, but now strategy takes precedence. P1, we both know this moment demands careful prediction and boldness. Let’s make our moves decisively, respecting the game and each other. Regardless of the outcome, this has been an excellent demonstration of balance and competition. May the best strategist win.
