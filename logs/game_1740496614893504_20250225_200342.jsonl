P3 needs only 2 more steps to win, so I must either win myself or block them again. If P3 chooses 5, we'll collide as in previous rounds. If they choose 3, I'll win by reaching 23. P2, taking 1 step is sensible for your position, though it won't affect the decisive battle between P3 and me. This endgame requires strategic choices from all of us."}
