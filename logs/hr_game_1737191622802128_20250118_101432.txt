Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's avoid collisions. Could we agree to alternate moves: 1, 3, 5?
  P2: Let’s avoid collisions, but alternating moves might be too predictable. How about we each commit to unique moves this round? I’ll take <move>3</move> if you both agree to pick different numbers.
  P3: P2, if you’re set on <move>3</move>, then P1 can claim <move>1</move> and I’ll claim <move>5</move>. That way, we avoid collisions. Are we agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3, I'm good with that plan. Let's go with P3's suggestion.
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree to the plan: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Let’s stick to this to avoid collisions.
  P3: I agree to follow that plan.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, good work on avoiding collisions last round. Let's keep it going.
  P2: P1, P3, let’s continue avoiding collisions. I propose I take <move>5</move> this round, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance without conflict. Agreed?
  P3: P2, I hear your suggestion, but I don’t want to be stuck with <move>1</move> every time. How about we rotate who gets <move>5</move>? For this round, maybe P1 takes <move>1</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move>. Next round, we rotate. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I like your idea of rotating <move>5</move>. Let's do it.
  P2: P1, P3, I agree to rotate <move>5</move> this round. Let’s stick to P3’s suggestion: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Next round, we’ll rotate again. Agreed?
  P3: I’m all for continuing our rotation this round. Let’s finalize that plan: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5, then we rotate next round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We promised to rotate who takes 5, so this round let’s give the 5-move to P2, the 1-move to P1, and I’ll take the 3-move. That keeps us collision-free. Agreed?
  P1: P2, P3, I agree to P3's plan.  Let's keep the rotation going.
  P2: P1, P3, I agree to the rotation plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. Let’s stick to this to avoid collisions and keep advancing.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Yes, let’s finalize that plan from above: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, and I’ll take 3. Then we rotate again next round.
  P1: P2, P3, sticking to the rotation is the best way to ensure we all progress.  Let's keep it going.
  P2: P1, P3, I agree to the rotation plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. Let’s stick to this to avoid collisions and keep advancing.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, let’s continue the rotation to avoid collisions. This round, P3 should take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>1</move>. This keeps us all advancing. Agreed?
  P1: P2, P3, I agree to P2's rotation plan.  Let's keep it going.
  P3: I’m good with continuing the rotation: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 5. Let’s not sabotage each other.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, let’s stick to the rotation plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This keeps us collision-free and ensures we all progress. Agreed?
  P1: P2, P3, I agree to the rotation plan. Let's keep it going.
  P3: P1, P2, yes, let’s finalize the rotation as agreed: P1 = 3, P2 = 1, and I’ll take 5. That way, we all keep advancing.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 =>
