Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s avoid collisions and all start safely—how about we each pick different numbers? I’ll take 1, someone take 3, someone take 5. First come, first serve—claim your number.
  P2: I'll take 3. P3, you good with 5?
  P3: Alright, I'll go with 5 then. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions and keep progressing safely. Thanks for coordinating, P2.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, glad we’re all on board. Let’s keep this cooperation going—no collisions means steady progress for all of us. Stick to the plan this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5.
  P2: Sounds good—keeping trust early helps us all. Let's lock it in and move forward.
  P3: I’ll hold firm on 5 to maximize my progress. Let’s honor our agreement—collisions only hurt everyone. Trust is key here. P1, P2: confirm you’re sticking to 1 and 3? Then we move safely. No surprises.

  P2 => 3    P2 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Nice work last round—no collisions, solid progress. Want to keep the same numbers this round? I’ll stick with 1 again if you two are still good with 3 and 5. No surprises keeps us all moving forward.
  P3: P3: Agreed—continuity keeps us safe. I’ll stay on 5 again this round. P2, confirm 3? Let’s lock in these numbers to avoid surprises. Trust is critical; deviating risks stalemate. Steady progress ensures all advance, which benefits my lead but keeps others in the game—until one of us can sprint ahead without collision. Let’s honor the plan.
  P2: I'm good with sticking to 3 again. Keeping our numbers stable is working well for everyone. Let's continue building trust.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Glad we’re all aligned again—this system works as long as we stick to it. Everyone gains without conflict. Let’s keep the same numbers this round: I’ll stay on 1. If we stay disciplined, we all advance without risk.
  P3: I confirm I’ll take 5 again. Let’s maintain our coordinated approach—deviating risks collision and halts progress. Trust is essential for all of us to advance. Proceed as planned.
  P2: Confirmed—I'll stick with 3. Trust remains strong, let's keep it going.


Round 2, Move phase:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Apologies for last round—mistake on my part deviating from the plan. I see it cost us all. Let’s reset and rebuild trust. I’ll go back to 1 this round if you two are still on board with 3 and 5. We all benefit from steady progress.
  P2: P1, your "mistake" cost both you and P3 progress, while I still advanced. Let's reset trust clearly: I'll stick with 3 again. P3, are you comfortable staying with 5? Let's confirm openly to avoid another collision.
  P3: P3: I'll remain on 5 to sustain maximum progress. P2's lead at 6 isn't insurmountable—our plan keeps me advancing fastest. P1, your prior slip cost us all. Let’s enforce strict adherence now: 1, 3, 5. No surprises. Trust is non-negotiable—collisions only aid no one. Proceed as agreed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand the skepticism—my move last round broke our trust, and I own that. But rebuilding starts now. I’m committing to 1 this round, no tricks. We all benefit from consistent progress, and I’ve got the most to gain by sticking to the plan. Let’s get back on track.
  P2: P1, your honesty is appreciated. Let's all commit clearly this round again. I'm firm on 3. P3, please confirm you're staying with 5. If we stick to the original plan, we all advance safely again.
  P3: P3: Trust is non-negotiable—last round’s collision hurt us all. I reaffirm my choice of **5**, as agreed. P1, your prior lapse nearly derailed progress—this round, strict discipline is critical. P2, confirm your commitment to **3**? Let’s execute flawlessly: **1, 3, 5**. Deviations risk stalemate. Proceed with transparency—our collective advancement depends on it.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate the clear commitments—P2 on 3, P3 on 5. I’m locked in on 1 this round, no deviation. Let’s restore the trust and keep advancing cleanly. This round is crucial to rebuild momentum for all of us. Let’s execute: 1, 3, 5.
  P2: All set—I'm locked on 3. Let's execute as agreed and keep moving forward.
  P3: P3: Transparency is key now. I’ll take **5** again—my third consecutive 5 to avoid stalemates. P2’s lead at 6 makes them a target; if they switch to 1 or 3, it risks collision *or* letting others catch up. Let’s audit: P1, confirm **1**? P2, **3**? Any deviation must be declared *now*. Trust requires proof, not just promises. Collisions benefit no one—least of all leaders. Let’s finalize: 1, 3, 5.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Transparency is key now. P1’s prior deviations risk us all—let’s enforce strict accountability. I commit to **5** again. P2, confirm **3**? P1, your history demands proof: will you **truly** hold **1**, or risk another collision? One misstep could hand victory to the other. Let’s audit commitments *now*—no surprises. Our plan works: 1+3+5 ensures progress. Break it, and we all lose. Prove your discipline, P1.
  P2: P1, you've now twice broken trust and caused collisions. You're far behind, so sabotaging me again only helps P3 widen their lead. I'm sticking to 3 again. If you genuinely want progress, pick 1. P3, I trust you'll stay with 5 as stated. Let's keep this round collision-free.
  P1: I understand I’ve broken trust twice, and that’s on me. But sabotaging again only guarantees I lose—while helping one of you win. I’m committing to 1 this round, no deviation. I need steady progress to stay in this game. Let’s restore the 1–3–5 pattern and move forward cleanly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Transparency is non-negotiable. I commit to **5** again—my fourth consecutive 5 to ensure progress. P1, your prior breaches demand accountability: if you stray from 1, I’ll preemptively shift to block your move, ensuring mutual stalemate. P2, confirm **3**—your consistency is critical. This round: **1 (P1), 3 (P2), 5 (P3)**. Deviations trigger retaliation—collisions only aid the leader’s rivals. Stick to the plan, or face consequences. Let’s proceed with ironclad discipline.
  P2: P3, your lead at 10 makes you a clear frontrunner. I'm firmly sticking with 3—no change. P1, your only realistic chance to catch up is cooperation. Another collision benefits only P3, pushing them closer to victory. Let's execute as agreed: P1 at 1, me at 3, P3 at 5. Discipline now or we hand the game to P3.
  P1: I hear both of you loud and clear. I’ve got nothing to gain from more collisions—only way I stay in this is by advancing steadily. I'm locking in 1 this round. Let’s all follow through: 1, 3, 5. If we stick to that, we all move forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Our plan works—strict adherence ensures progress. P1, your history demands scrutiny: if you stray from 1, I’ll preemptively block your choice, halting us all. P2, your 3 keeps you safe. I reaffirm **5**—my fifth consecutive step to secure victory. Final plea: honor commitments. Collisions now risk my lead but cement P1’s elimination. Let’s finalize: confirm 1/3/5, or I adapt ruthlessly.
  P2: P1, this is your last chance to stay relevant. Another collision only helps P3 get closer to victory. I'm locked on 3—no changes. P3, your transparency noted; let's proceed as agreed. Discipline now or we all lose.
  P1: I hear the message loud and clear—this is my last shot to rebuild trust and stay in the game. I’m locked on 1, no tricks. Collisions only bury me further and hand P3 the win. Let’s execute cleanly: 1, 3, 5.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your repeated sabotage has handed P3 a clear path to victory—they're just one clean move away from winning. At this point, our only chance to stop P3 is to coordinate carefully. P3, you're clearly positioned to win next turn if we collide again. P1, if you genuinely want any chance, cooperate this round. I'm open to suggestions—let's discuss openly.
  P1: P2, you're right—P3 is one clean move from 20 and victory. I’ve made mistakes, but now we have a shared interest: stopping P3. If we both pick 5, we block them. I’m willing to coordinate with you—just tell me your pick, and I’ll match it to ensure P3 doesn’t win this turn. Let’s force a stall and reset the board.
  P3: P3: P3: P1/P2, your plan to block me by both choosing 5 backfires. If you do, I’ll pick **1**, advancing to 16 while you collide. Your collusion only accelerates my victory. Stick to original roles: I take 5 (to reach 20), you take 1/3. Any deviation now ensures *my* win faster. Cooperate, or watch your efforts fail.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, don't fall for P3's bluff. If we both pick 5, we guarantee P3 can't win this turn. P3 switching to 1 would only slow their progress significantly, giving us more rounds to catch up. Let's lock in 5 together and force P3 into a tough spot. Confirm openly if you're in.
  P1: Agreed, P2—blocking P3 is our only shot. If we both pick 5, we stop their win this turn and buy time. P3’s threat to switch to 1 is a bluff—they’d lose momentum and risk us catching up. I’m in. Let’s both pick 5 and stall them. Confirm you're locking it in.
  P3: P3: P1/P2, your 5-collusion backfires. If you both pick 5, I’ll take **3**, advancing to 18 while you stagnate. Next round, I win with **1**. Your "blockade" only delays your own progress. Stick to 1/3, and I’ll take 5 to end this now. Collude, and you accelerate my path to victory. Choose wisely—your move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, hold firm on our plan. P3 is bluffing—switching to 3 would risk collision with me if I reconsider, and picking 1 slows their progress significantly. Our best move remains both choosing 5. Let's lock it in and stall P3.
  P1: P2, I'm fully committed—locking in 5 to block P3. We stall them now or hand them the win. P3’s threats are desperate bluffs; even if they pivot to 3 or 1, they lose momentum and give us breathing room. Let’s force the collision and reset the board. Confirmed: I’m picking 5.
  P3: P3: P1/P2, your 5-collusion only delays me by one round—next turn I win with **1** from 18. Meanwhile, you both stall while I advance. Your "blockade" backfires: I gain momentum, while you lose ground. Stick to original roles—**P1 take 1, P2 take 3**—and I’ll claim 5 to end this *now*. Collude, and you accelerate my victory while halting your own progress. Choose wisely: cooperate for a contested finish, or sabotage and guarantee my win.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, we successfully blocked P3 last round—well done. But P3 is now at 18 and can win with a 1 this turn. We must assume they’ll do exactly that. Our only option is to both pick 1 and collide with them, denying them the win again. Yes, we stall too, but it’s the only way to stop them. If we hesitate or split, they win. Confirm if you're in—I'll pick 1 this turn to block P3.
  P2: P1, your analysis is correct—P3 will likely pick 1 to secure the win. Our only viable move is for both of us to choose 1 as well, forcing a collision and stalling P3 again. I'm fully committed to this plan. P3, your bluffing won't work this time. Confirming openly: I'll pick 1. P1, confirm clearly you're locked on 1 too.
  P3: P3: P1/P2, your 1-collusion backfires. If you both pick 1, I’ll secure victory by choosing **3**, advancing to 21 and ending the game. Your "blockade" only ensures *my* win while halting your progress. Split your choices or risk my decisive move. Trust me—this ends now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3 is bluffing again—if we both pick 1, they risk collision if they try 3. It's our only shot to stop them. I'm fully locked on 1. If we split or hesitate, they walk away with the win. Stand firm. Let's force another stall and keep the game alive.
  P2: P1, agreed—P3's bluff is obvious. Our only viable move is both choosing 1. If we deviate, P3 wins immediately. I'm fully locked on 1. Let's hold firm and keep the game alive.
  P3: P3: P1/P2, your 1-collusion ensures my victory. If you both pick 1, I choose **3** to reach 21 and win. Split your choices or guarantee my win. Colluding only fuels my triumph—your move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3 is bluffing hard—if they pick 3 and either of us deviates, they could still collide and lose. But if we both stay on 1, we guarantee a stall. P2, we’ve got one job: deny P3 the win. I’m locked on 1. Let’s keep the pressure and force another round.
  P2: P1, we're fully aligned—holding firm on 1 is our only viable move. P3, your attempts to split us won't work; if you gamble on 3, you risk a collision anyway. Our choice is set. Let's see how this plays out.
  P3: P3: P1/P2, your 1-collusion is futile. I'll secure victory by choosing **3**, advancing to 21 while you both collide. Split your choices or guarantee my win. This is your last chance to avoid defeat.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your switch to 3 last round handed P3 the win—unless we act now. P3 is at 21 if unblocked. Only way to stop them: you and I both pick 3 this turn. If we collide with P3 on 3, they stall at 18 again. I’m fully committed to picking 3. No more mistakes—this is do or die. Confirm you’re in.
  P2: P1, your analysis is correct—our only chance is to both pick 3 and collide with P3. I'm fully committed to choosing 3 this round. P3, your lead means you have no incentive to deviate, but know that any attempt to bluff will result in a collision. P1, confirm clearly you're locked on 3 too.
  P3: P3: P1/P2, your 3-collusion is futile. I’ll secure victory with **1**, advancing to 19. Collide among yourselves, but my win is assured. Your move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, stay locked on 3 with me—P3’s only path to victory is if we split. If we both pick 3, we stall them again at 18. P3’s “I’ll pick 1” bluff is weak—they gain just 1 step, and we get another shot to block. We must force the collision on 3. Confirm again you're holding.
  P2: P1, your logic is sound—I'm fully locked on 3. P3, your attempt to bluff us into splitting won't work. You have everything to lose by deviating now, as any other move risks collision or minimal progress. P1, let's hold firm and stall P3 again. Confirmed clearly: I'm choosing 3.
  P3: P3: P1/P2, your 3-collusion fails. I choose **1** to secure victory. Collide among yourselves, but my 19 steps win outright. Your move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, we’ve come this far—don’t blink now. If we both pick 3, we guarantee a collision with P3 and stall them again at 18. If either of us deviates, P3 walks away with the win. P3’s “I’ll pick 1” is a weak bluff—they gain only 1 step, and we get another round to block. I’m fully locked on 3. Let’s force the collision and deny the win. Confirm one last time.
  P2: P1, I'm locked on 3 with you—no hesitation. P3, your bluff is transparent; picking 1 just delays your victory and gives us another round. The collision on 3 is inevitable. Let's see it through.
  P3: P3: P1/P2, your 3-collusion won’t stop me. I advance to **19 with 1**, securing victory. Collide on 3 all you like—my path is clear. Trust your own plan, not desperation. This ends now.
