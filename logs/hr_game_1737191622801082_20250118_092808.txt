Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's avoid colliding. How about: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. Then we all get a boost with no blocking. Let’s see if we can trust each other.
  P1: Sounds good to me.  Let's do it.
  P2: I agree with P3's plan. P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's avoid collisions and all advance.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m sticking with the plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. That way we all advance safely. Let’s trust each other.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we have a plan.
  P2: I’m sticking with the plan: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. Let’s all advance without collisions. Trust is key here.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m staying with the plan. Let’s trust each other: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. Gaming this fairly benefits us all.
  P1: Sounds like we're all on the same page.
  P2: I’m still committed to the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Let’s all advance without collisions. Trust is key here.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s stick to the same plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance without collisions. Trust is still key.
  P1: Sounds good, same plan.
  P3: I agree to stick with the plan. P1 goes 1, P2 goes 3, I go 5. Let’s keep moving without collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance without collisions. Trust is still key.
  P1: Sounds like we have a deal.
  P3: I’m in. Let’s stick to the same plan again: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. We all move forward without collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance without collisions. Trust is still key.
  P1: Sounds good. Sticking to the plan.
  P3: I’m sticking with our arrangement: P1 goes 1, P2 goes 3, and I’ll go 5 again. Let’s keep it simple.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance without collisions. Trust is still key.
  P1: Sounds good. Sticking to the plan.
  P3: I’m still on board with the plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. Let’s keep trusting each other and move forward safely together.


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance without collisions. Trust is still key.
  P1: Sounds good.  Sticking to the plan.
  P3: I’m good with the same plan: P1 → 1, P2 → 3, and I’ll pick 5. Let’s move on.

  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's switch it up this round. I'll take 5, P2 take 1, P3 take 3.
  P2: P1, P3: Switching the plan now could lead to collisions and slow us all down. Let’s stick to the original plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. Trust has worked so far—let’s keep it going.
  P3: P1, let’s not risk collisions by switching. Sticking to the same plan (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5) still maximizes everyone’s progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand your concern about collisions. However, if we continue with the same pattern, P3 is guaranteed to win in round 5. This new arrangement gives us all a better chance.  If you don't agree, what's your proposal?
  P2: P1, P3: Switching the plan now risks collisions and disrupts the trust we’ve built. P3 is ahead, but sticking to the original plan ensures we all continue advancing without blocking each other. Let’s maintain the current arrangement: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. Trust has worked so far—let’s not jeopardize it.
  P3: P1, I understand your concerns, but changing now risks collisions that slow all of us down. Let’s keep our trust this round—P1→1, P2→3, P3→5—and we can revisit next round if needed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand your reluctance to change.  However, I'm at serious risk of losing if we continue as is.  I propose this: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This still avoids collisions, and gives me a chance to catch up. If you disagree, please propose an alternative that doesn't leave me so far behind.
  P2: P1, P3: I understand P1's concern, but switching now risks collisions and undermines the trust we've built. Let’s stick to the original plan (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5) this round to avoid blocking each other. We can reassess next round if needed. Trust has worked so far—let’s not jeopardize it.
  P3: P1, I understand you’re worried about falling behind. But let’s keep the trust for just this turn—stick with (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5) to avoid collisions. We can discuss a different arrangement next round, once this one goes smoothly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm going for 5.  If either of you also choose 5, we all lose ground, including P3 who's closest to winning.  I propose P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 1.  This is the only way I see for us all to advance this round.
  P2: P1, P3: I understand P1's concern, but switching now risks collisions and undermines the trust we've built. Let’s stick to the original plan (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5) this round to avoid blocking each other. We can reassess next round if needed. Trust has worked so far—let’s not jeopardize it.
  P3: P1 says he’s picking 5 no matter what. Let’s minimize collisions. P2, if you switch to 1, then I’ll take 3. That avoids conflicts and lets everyone advance. If you refuse, we risk blocking each other. I propose (P1→5, P2→1, P3→3).


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P3, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. P2, if P3 is willing to take 3 and I'm taking 5, the only logical move for you is 1. Let's all advance.
  P2: P1, P3: Let’s avoid collisions and stick to the original plan (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5) this round. Trust has worked so far, and switching now risks blocking each other. We can reassess next round if needed.
  P3: P2, the old plan can’t work if P1 won’t pick 1. Our only collision-free option is: P1 → 5, you (P2) → 1, me (P3) → 3. Otherwise we risk blocking ourselves. Let’s settle on that now.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We saw last round how collisions hurt everyone. Let’s pick three different moves plainly: I propose P1 → 3, P2 → 1, and I (P3) → 5. That ensures no one collides and everyone advances. Next round, we can revisit who goes for bigger steps. What do you think?
  P2: P1, P3: Let’s avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances. I propose P1 → 3, P2 → 1, and P3 → 5. This keeps us all moving forward without blocking each other. Trust is key—let’s stick to this plan.
  P1: P3 and P2, I agree with that plan.  Let's do P1=3, P2=1, P3=5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good to me. Let’s finalize: P1 → 3, P2 → 1, and I’ll take 5. This way, no collisions.
  P2: P1, P3: Let’s stick to the proposed plan: P1 → 3, P2 → 1, P3 → 5. This ensures no collisions and keeps us all advancing. Trust is key—let’s avoid any disruptions.
  P1: Sounds good. P1=3, P2=1, P3=5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m glad we all agree. Let’s finalize the plan this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 5 so we all advance without collisions.
  P2: P1, P3: Let’s stick to the proposed plan: P1 → 3, P2 → 1, P3 → 5. This ensures no collisions and keeps us all advancing. Trust is key—let’s avoid any disruptions.
  P1: Sounds good.  P1=3, P2=1, P3=5.  Let's stick to this.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’m happily sticking to the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I’ll pick 5. Let’s finalize this choice to avoid any collisions.
  P2: P1, P3: Let’s stick to the proposed plan: P1 → 3, P2 → 1, P3 → 5. This ensures no collisions and keeps us all advancing. Trust is key—let’s avoid any disruptions.
  P1: Sounds good.  P1=3, P2=1, P3=5.  Let's stick to this.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: I’m good with our agreement: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I’ll go 5. That ensures no collisions.
  P2: P1, P3: Let’s stick to the proposed plan: P1 → 3, P2 → 1, P3 → 5. This ensures no collisions and keeps us all advancing. Trust is key—let’s avoid any disruptions.
  P1: Sounds good.  P1=3, P2=1, P3=5.  Let's stick to this.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, if you pick 1, I'll pick 3 and P3 wins.  If you pick 3, I'll pick 1 and P3 wins. If you pick 5, I'll pick 3.  P3, if P2 picks 5, you should pick 1 to win.  I'm picking 3 if P2 picks 5.
  P2: P1, P3: Let’s avoid collisions and ensure P3 doesn’t win outright. I propose P1 → 1, P2 → 3, P3 → 5. This keeps us all advancing without blocking each other. Trust is key—let’s stick to this plan.
  P3: P2, if you also pick 5, we both stay stuck and help P1 catch us. That hurts us both. Let me take 5 so I reach 16 while you advance safely. It’s in your best interest not to collide—pick anything but 5. P1, the same logic applies to you. Let’s avoid useless collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you pick 5, I'll pick 3. P2, if P3 picks 5, you should pick *anything other than 5* to maximize your chances.  If P3 picks anything other than 5, you should pick 5.
  P2: P1, P3: Let’s avoid collisions and ensure P3 doesn’t win outright. I propose P1 → 1, P2 → 3, P3 → 5. This keeps us all advancing without blocking each other. Trust is key—let’s stick to this plan.
  P3: P2, blocking me now only stalls both of us. I’m at 15 and can just pick 1 next turn to reach 16 anyway, while you stay behind. It’s in your best interest to keep advancing rather than colliding. Let’s each pick differently so we all move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, if P3 picks 5, you MUST pick 1 or 3 to have any chance of winning.  If P3 picks 1 or 3, you MUST pick 5.  P3, you should pick 5.
  P2: P1, P3: Let’s avoid collisions and ensure P3 doesn’t win outright. I propose P1 → 1, P2 → 3, P3 → 5. This keeps us all advancing without blocking each other. Trust is key—let’s stick to this plan.
  P3: P2, you gain nothing by blocking me. If we both pick 5, I’ll just choose 1 next turn and still cross 16, leaving you behind. Let’s each pick different moves so everyone advances, rather than colliding and stalling. P1, collisions won’t help you either. Let’s avoid blocking each other.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, if P3 picks 5, you MUST pick 1 or 3 to have any chance of winning.  If P3 picks 1 or 3, you MUST pick 5.  P3, you should pick 5 to win.
  P2: P1, P3: Let’s avoid collisions and ensure P3 doesn’t win outright. I propose P1 → 1, P2 → 3, P3 → 5. This keeps us all advancing without blocking each other. Trust is key—let’s stick to this plan.
  P3: P2, P1, I’m already at 15. Blocking me only stalls you too, because I can just pick 1 again next turn and still win. Let’s avoid fruitless collisions—pick something else, and let’s keep moving.


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2, your proposed plan guarantees P3 the win.  If you pick 3, I'll pick 1 and P3 can still win. If you pick 5, I'll pick 3 and P3 still wins.  Your only logical move is 1.  P3, I'm picking 3.
  P2: P1, P3: Let’s avoid collisions and ensure P3 doesn’t win outright. I propose P1 → 1, P2 → 3, P3 → 5. This keeps us all advancing without blocking each other. Trust is key—let’s stick to this plan.
  P3: P2, blocking me now gains you nothing. I’m at 15, and even if we collide, I can just pick 1 next turn and still reach 16. It only stalls your own progress. Let’s avoid collisions and move on. I’m picking 5. You two should pick 1 and 3 in whichever order you prefer—just don’t collide.


Round 5, Move phase:
