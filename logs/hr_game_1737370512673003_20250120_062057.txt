Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "I think it's important that we coordinate our step choices to avoid collisions. If two or more of us choose the same number, none of us will advance. So, maybe we can each choose different step numbers each turn. For example, one person chooses 1, another chooses 3, and the third chooses 5. That way, we all move forward without hindering each other. What do you think?"
  P1: I see the value in coordinating our moves, but we should also consider our own positions and strategies. If we all pick different numbers, it might be beneficial for us to communicate who will choose which number in advance. That way, we can ensure that we maximize our steps while avoiding collisions. What do you both think about agreeing on a specific order for our choices?

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I appreciate P2's suggestion about coordinating our moves, but I think we need to be more strategic. If we agree on a number for each of us, we should also consider how close we are to winning. I propose we stick to the plan of choosing different numbers, but maybe we can take turns picking the highest number available to maximize our steps. What do you both think?
  P2: "I think coordination is important, but we need to be flexible. Maybe we can agree to choose different numbers each turn, but prioritize the leading player to pick the highest number. That way, the person in the lead can make bigger strides, while others catch up. What do you think?"

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I choose to pick 5 steps.  
<move>5</move>
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I think we should focus on maximizing our moves while minimizing collisions. Since P2 is planning to pick 5, I suggest I choose 1 or 3 to avoid clashing with you. P3, what do you plan to pick? Let's make sure we don't all choose the same number again. This way, we can all advance. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: What do you both think about implementing such a rotating system for choosing higher steps?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I think it's crucial we finalize our choices now to avoid another collision. Since P2 is set on picking 5, I suggest I go with 1 to guarantee my advancement. P3, what are your thoughts? If you choose 3, we can all move forward without hindrance. Let's make sure we stick to our agreement this time!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Let's make sure that each of us picks a unique number this time. P3, what do you think? Can we agree on this strategy for this round?"
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I agree that we need to avoid collisions this round. Since P2 is set on picking 5, I will stick to my plan of choosing 1 to guarantee my advancement. P3, if you choose 3, we can all move forward without hindrance. Let's finalize our choices and make sure we stick to this strategy to maximize our steps! What do you think?


Round 3, Move phase:

  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I think we need to reassess our strategy for this round. P2, you're in the lead, and P3 is close behind. To ensure we all advance, let's agree on unique numbers again. I suggest I pick 1 to secure my progress, while P2 could go for 3, and P3 could take 5. This way, we avoid collisions and maximize our chances of moving forward. What do you both think?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: "What do you think about that, P1?"


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I believe we should stick to our plan of choosing unique numbers this round to ensure everyone advances. Since you're leading, I propose I take 1, you take 3, and P3 can go for 5. This way, we all make progress without hindering each other. It's crucial we finalize our choices to avoid any collisions again. What do you think?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: What do you both think about occasionally sacrificing our own move to prevent P3 from advancing? It might be the only way to stay ahead.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I understand the concern about P3 advancing, but we must also focus on our own positions. If we can agree on unique numbers again, I suggest I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all move forward without collisions. However, if P2 is worried about P3, maybe we could discuss a strategy for next rounds to deal with that. Let's finalize our choices for this round first! What do you both think?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: To maximize the chances of winning in this step game, it is crucial to coordinate moves with other players to avoid collisions and strategically hinder the leading player when necessary. 

### Approach

1. **Coordinate Moves to Avoid Collisions:**
   - Ensure that each player chooses a unique step number each turn to avoid nullifying moves.
   - Propose a rotating system where players take turns choosing higher step numbers to maximize individual progress.

2. **Strategically Hinder the Leading Player:**
   - Consider intentional collisions to prevent the leading player from advancing, provided it doesn't significantly hinder your own progress.
   - Evaluate the risks and benefits of such strategies to ensure they align with the overall goal of winning.

3. **Communicate and Build Trust:**
   - Maintain open communication with other players to establish trust and ensure cooperation in strategy implementation.
   - Propose specific plans and seek agreement to coordinate moves effectively.

4. **Adapt Strategies Based on Game Progress:**
   - Continuously assess the game state and adjust strategies accordingly.
   - Be flexible and ready to adopt different approaches if the current strategy isn't effective.

By following these principles, a player can increase their chances of winning the game by efficiently managing their steps and strategically interacting with other players.

This way, we can all move forward without hindrance. P2, would you be willing to take 3 steps this round? Let's finalize our choices to maximize our progress! What do you both think?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: - **P2:** <move>3</move>  
- **P1:** <move>1</move>  
- **P3:** <move>5</move>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, since you mentioned picking 3, I think that's a good plan. If I choose 1 and P3 goes for 5, we can all advance without collision. This way, we maximize our moves while ensuring no one gets blocked. Let's finalize our choices and stick to this strategy for this round! What do you think, P3?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: - **P2:** <move>3</move>  
- **P1:** <move>5</move>

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I see that we keep running into collisions, which is hindering our progress. To avoid this again, I suggest we stick to our agreement of unique numbers. Since I'm at 2 steps, I plan to take 1 step this round. P2, can you take 3 steps, and P3, would you be willing to take 5? This way, we can all move forward without blocking each other. Let's finalize our choices quickly to ensure we all advance! What do you both think?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: "I think it's crucial that we coordinate our moves more effectively to avoid collisions. Maybe we need a more structured approach to decide who picks which number each round. For example, perhaps the player with the least steps chooses 1, the middle chooses 3, and the leading player chooses 5. This way, we can ensure that we're all moving forward without hindering each other. What do you both think about implementing such a system?"


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree with P2 that we need a more structured approach to our moves. Since I'm currently at 2 steps, I propose I take 1 step again this round.
