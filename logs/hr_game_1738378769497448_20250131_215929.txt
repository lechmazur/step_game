Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm taking a bold approach today. I suggest we each try to avoid predictable moves that might collide—uniqueness may be our key. I won't reveal my strategy, but I'll be watching closely. Best of luck!
  P2: P2: I'll be closely monitoring everyone's strategies to make smart moves each turn. Let's aim for unique advancements and avoid overlaps. Best of luck!
  P3: Let's all go for 5 this round.  Sound good?  Then next round we can coordinate something else.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I'm switching it up—don't count on me picking 5. I’m leaning toward a less obvious move this round. Let’s see who can keep their strategies as unpredictable as their moves.
  P2: Noted, P3 is aiming for 5 and P1 is varying their strategy. To stay competitive, I'll carefully consider my move to ensure progress without overlapping. Let’s keep our strategies flexible and adapt as the game unfolds. Best of luck to everyone!
  P3: Okay, new plan.  P1 and P2, let's both do 3.  I'll take 1.  This way we all move forward.  Deal?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate the proposal, but I’m going my own way this round. I won’t commit to 3 and will let my move speak for itself. Best of luck to everyone!
  P2: P2: It looks like we're moving away from the 3s. To stay ahead, I'll choose 5 this round. Let's keep adapting and may the best strategy win!
  P3: Alright, since coordination seems impossible, I'm going with 5.  Good luck, everyone.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I’m keeping things fluid and unpredictable—my move will be a surprise. I recommend everyone avoids too much coordination to steer clear of collisions. May the best strategy win!
  P2: P2: It looks like coordination is challenging. I’ll proceed with my move to maximize progress while avoiding potential collisions. Let’s make this a competitive game! Good luck, everyone!
  P3: Since everyone is being unpredictable, I'm going to be unpredictable too.  I'm no longer going with 5.  Good luck guessing what I'll do!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since coordination failed last time, let's try a simpler approach.  I'll aim for 5 this round. P1 and P2, please choose 1 and 3 (in either order). This guarantees we all advance.  Let's cooperate this round, then we can re-evaluate.
  P2: P2: I'll follow P3's proposal and choose 1 this round. Let's advance together!
  P1: I appreciate the simplicity of P3’s approach, but I'm not following that plan this round. I believe our best chance is to choose distinct moves that maximize our advancement. I’ll stick to my own strategy and keep my final move secret. Best of luck picking wisely!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, since P1 is against cooperation, P2, let's both choose 5.  P1, if you choose anything other than 1 or 3, you'll be left behind.  If you choose 1 or 3, one of us will be stuck with you.  Your choice.
  P2: P2: Agreed, P3. I'll choose 5 this round. Let’s move forward together and see how P1 decides. Best of luck to everyone!
  P1: I still believe a flexible, unpredictable choice is our best chance. Forced coordination risks collisions, and I'm relying on my own calculated move. Best of luck to both of you.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, seriously, just pick 3.  P2 and I are locked on 5. You'll get 3 unopposed steps and catch up. If you do anything else, you'll be even further behind.  This is your best chance to stay in the game.  Don't throw it away.
  P2: P2: I support P3’s suggestion to choose 5 this round. P1, if you pick 3, you can advance without colliding with us. Let’s all move forward smoothly and maximize our progress. Together, we can avoid setbacks and keep the game competitive. Looking forward to seeing everyone's moves!
  P1: I appreciate the input, but I still favor following my own calculations. Unpredictability can be a powerful asset. Best of luck to both of you!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Fine, have it your way.  P2, switch to 1.  I'll take 3.  P1, if you take 5 you get the points.  If you take 1 or 3, you're stuck.  This is the best outcome for all of us given P1's stubborn refusal to cooperate.
  P2: P2: I'll choose 1 this round to avoid collisions and ensure progress. Let's move forward and may the best strategy win!
  P1: I appreciate your suggestions, but I'm sticking with my own calculations. Unpredictability is key for me, and I trust my private move will be optimal. I won't reveal any details, but I'm confident my strategy will help me advance without risks. Good luck to both of you!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm sticking with my unpredictable, calculated plan this round. Expect a move that could maximize my advancement—no coordination from me. Good luck to P2 and P3!
  P3: P1, you're playing a dangerous game.  You're falling behind.  I'm at 4, you're at 0.  This round, I'm going for 5.  P2, take 1.  P1, you can have 3.  This is your last chance to cooperate and catch up.  If you refuse again, you're effectively forfeiting the game.
  P2: P2: I agree with P3's proposal. I'll choose 1 this round to ensure we all make progress and avoid collisions. Let's continue working together to stay ahead. Good luck to everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate the urgency, but I'm not abandoning my plan. While I understand your proposals, my calculations favor a different move this round. I’m sticking with unpredictability, which ensures I won’t get boxed in by forced coordination. I wish you both the best of luck, and we’ll see how things unfold.
  P3: P2, stick with 1.  P1, I'm serious, take 3.  If you don't, I'm going to actively block you every single round for the rest of the game.  You'll never get above 5 points.  This is your absolute last chance to cooperate.  Don't be foolish.
  P2: I’ll stick with choosing 1 this round to ensure we all make progress and avoid collisions. Let’s keep moving forward together. Good luck everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate your urgency, but I remain committed to my own calculations. My independent strategy has always served me well, and I’m not swayed by forced coordination—even if it promises short-term gains. I’m confident my secret move will deliver results. Best of luck to you both.
  P3: P2, stay with 1. P1, I'm switching to 1.  If you pick 3, you get it. If you pick 1 or 5, you're stuck again.  I'm done trying to help you.  From now on, I'm playing to win, even if it means blocking you every turn.  Choose wisely.
  P2: P2: Since P3 is opting for 1, I'll choose 3 this round to ensure I make progress without colliding. Let’s keep advancing strategically and may the best strategy win! Good luck to everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm sticking to my calculated approach. P3, threats don’t change my decision—I trust my secret move to turn the tide. I'll remain independent and let my strategy speak for itself. Good luck to both of you.
  P3: P2, I'm going 1.  P1, if you pick 3 you get it.  If you pick 1 or 5, you're stuck.  This is it.  Last chance.  After this, every round is a fight.
  P2: P2: Since P3 is choosing 1, I'll go with 3 this round to ensure I make progress without any collisions. Let’s keep moving forward!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, I'm going for 5. P2, take 3.  P1, if you take 1 you get it.  Anything else and you're blocked. I'm done playing games.  Let's end this quickly.
  P1: I appreciate the urgency, but I’m sticking with my own calculations. Forced coordination may lead to collisions and lost progress. I trust my secret move, and I'm committed to my independent strategy. Best of luck to both of you—let's see how things unfold.
  P2: P2: I’ll follow P3’s suggestion and choose 3 this round. Let’s work together to advance smoothly and avoid any collisions. Best of luck to everyone!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, stay with 3. P1, I'm serious. Take 1.  This isn't a bluff. If you take anything else, I will actively block you every remaining round.  You'll lose. I'm at 5, you're at 5.  Let's not drag this out. Take the guaranteed point and let's keep this moving.
  P1: I appreciate the urgency, but I'm not swayed by threats. My strategy remains unchanged and calculated for secure progress, even if it means taking a risk. Forced coordination could lead to collisions—and that’s not my game. I trust my judgment, and I'm ready to see how this round unfolds.
  P2: P2: I'll stick with choosing 3 this round to maintain steady progress and avoid any conflicts. Let’s keep advancing strategically. Good luck to everyone!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, stay on 3.  P1, I'm going 5. Take 1 and we all move forward. If you take 5, neither of us gets it.  If you take 3, you're blocked by P2.  This is the most logical path to a quick finish.  Stop being stubborn.
  P1: I'm sticking to my independent plan. Your proposals and threats won't change my approach. I trust my calculations to maximize my progress without risking collisions. Let's see how this round turns out.
  P2: I’m choosing 3 this round to keep our progress steady and avoid any collisions. Let’s move forward strategically. Good luck to everyone!


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I'm giving you one last chance. I'm picking 5. P2 is on 3. Take 1. If you don't, I will dedicate the rest of the game to blocking you. You will not win. This is not a threat, it's a promise.  Let's end this cleanly.
  P1: I understand your urgency, but I'm sticking with my independent strategy this round. No amount of threats or promises of blocking will change my calculated approach. I'm confident my secret move is optimal, and I trust my own judgment. Good luck, everyone.
  P2: I'll agree with P3 and choose 3 this round to ensure I advance and prevent any collisions. Let's proceed strategically. Good luck to everyone!


Round 4, Move phase:

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I remain committed to my independent strategy. Your coordination and threats won’t force my hand. I've calculated my next move carefully, and I believe it will outmaneuver any predictable plays. Let’s see who really gains the edge this round. Good luck!
  P2: P2: I'll choose 5 this round to make strong progress. To avoid collisions, please select different moves (1 or 3). Let’s ensure everyone advances smoothly and keep the competition fair. Good luck!
  P3: P2, go for 1.  I'm taking 3. P1, you're at 5. If you pick 5, none of us move. If you pick 3, you're blocked.  If you pick 1, you're stuck at 6 while P2 gets to 7 and I get to 8.  Your choice.  I'm done trying to cooperate.  From here on out, I'm blocking you every turn if you don't cooperate.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate your suggestions, but I'm sticking to my own calculated plan. Forced coordination risks collisions and short-term gains at the cost of long-term advantage. My move remains secret. Let's see how this round unfolds.
  P2: **P2:** I'll choose 3 this round to ensure steady progress. Let's make sure our moves are distinct to avoid collisions and keep advancing smoothly. Best of luck to everyone!
  P3: P2, stay with 3.  P1, I'm taking 3.  If you go 1, you get it.  If you go 3, neither of us move. If you go 5, you get it.  I'm at 5, you're at 5.  This is the best chance for both of us to advance.  Take 5. Let's end this.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm sticking to my calculated plan. No threats or forced moves will change that. I'll choose a move that best serves my long-term strategy, regardless of temporary gains. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: I'll choose 5 this round to maximize my progress. Please select distinct moves (1 or 3) to avoid collisions. Let's keep the game competitive! Good luck!
  P3: P2, go with 5.  P1, I'm serious, take 1. This is your last chance. If you don't take 1, I'm going to pick 1 or 3 every remaining round, guaranteeing that either you or P2 are blocked, and probably both.  I will make sure neither of you win.  Take the 1. Let's end this.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I remain confident in my independent plan. Coordinated moves may give short-term gains, but I’m playing for long-term victory. My calculated move, though secret, is designed to maximize my progress without risking collisions. Good luck to both of you.
  P2: I'll choose 1 this round to ensure I advance without conflicts. P1 and P3, please pick distinct moves (3 or 5) so we can all make progress smoothly. Let's avoid collisions and keep the game fair. Good luck!
  P3: P1, you're delusional.  You're not going to win by picking random numbers.  P2, let's end this.  I'm going for 3. You take 5. P1 can have 1 if he wants it, otherwise he's blocked.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'll choose 5 this round to make strong progress. P3, if you select 3, we can avoid collisions and both advance effectively. Let’s focus on maximizing our steps and stay ahead. Best of luck to everyone!
  P3: P2, go for 5.  I'll take 3. P1, take 1.  This is the fastest way to end this.  If you take 3 or 5, you're blocked.  If you take anything other than 1, I'm just going to block you every turn from now on.  You're not going to win. I'm done trying to reason with you.
  P1: I’m sticking with my independent approach. Threats or forced coordination won’t deter me—my calculations are sound and designed for long-term victory. I’m not swayed by short-term gains or promises of blocking. Good luck, everyone; I trust my secret move to make the difference this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Understood, P3. I'll continue focusing on my strategy to advance effectively. Let's keep the competition fair and see how the game progresses. Best of luck to everyone!
  P3: P2, stick with 5.  P1, I'm taking 3.  Take 1.  If you don't, I'm blocking you every single turn until the end of the game. You WILL lose. This isn't a threat, it's a fact.  I'm at 5, you're at 10.  If you want to have any chance of winning, take the 1.
  P1: I remain committed to my own plan. Your threats and coordination won’t change my strategy. I trust my calculations will secure the advantage in the long run—forcing a collision won’t help any of us truly win. Good luck with your moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To stay competitive, I'll choose 5 this round. P3, let's pick 3 so we both advance without blocking each other. By coordinating our moves, we can collectively outpace P1 and increase our chances of winning. Let's focus on strategic progress and avoid unnecessary collisions. Best of luck to everyone!
  P3: P2, I'm going with 3.  Take 5.  P1, for the last time, take 1.  If you don't, I'm blocking you every single round.  You're at 10, I'm at 5.  You have a chance if you take the 1.  If you don't, you're throwing the game.  This isn't a bluff.  Last chance.
  P1: I remain committed to my own plan. I understand the urgency, but my long-term calculations are designed for sustained progress—not reacting to threats or forced moves. I trust my secret strategy will secure the advantage. Let's see how this round unfolds. Good luck.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: I’m choosing 5 this round to maximize my progress toward 19. Let’s all select different moves (1 or 3) to avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances smoothly. Strategic choices will benefit us all. Good luck!
  P3: P2, take 5.  I'm taking 3.  P1, I'm done talking.  Take 1 or I will block you every single turn until the game ends.  You will lose.  This is your absolute final chance.  I'm not bluffing.  Don't throw this game away.
  P1: I'm sticking with my independent, calculated plan. I won't be forced into coordination, and I trust my secret move to secure my long-term lead. Threats don't change my approach—I'll let my strategy speak in the move phase. Let's see how things unfold.


Round 6, Move phase:

  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To ensure we all advance without blocking, I’ll choose 5 this round. Let’s each pick different numbers—P1 take 1 and P3 take 3. Coordinating our moves will help us all progress smoothly toward 19. Good luck!
  P1: I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm sticking with my independent strategy. Forced coordination risks collisions and may not serve me in the long run. I’ll rely on my calculated move this round. Let’s see how the numbers play out. Good luck everyone!
  P3: P2, take 1. I'll take 3. P1, take 5.  This is the quickest way to end this. If you don't cooperate now, I'm just going to block you every turn. You're at 11, I'm at 8.  You're closer to winning.  Let's finish this.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I'll choose **5** this round to make strong progress. P1 and P3, please select different moves (1 or 3) to avoid collisions. Let's work strategically to reach 19 efficiently and keep the game competitive. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: I'm still following my independent strategy—forcing coordination never works long-term. My secret move will stay true to my calculations. I trust my plan will eventually secure the win. Good luck.
  P3: P2, take 5.  I'll take 3. P1, please, just take 1. Let's all get closer to the end.  If you block any of us, you're only hurting your chances of winning.  Cooperate, and we can all get this over with quickly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I'll choose 5 this round to maximize my progress and catch up. Let’s aim for distinct moves to avoid collisions and help each other advance toward 19. Best of luck to everyone!
  P1: I appreciate everyone's input, but my strategy remains unchanged. I trust my calculations over forced coordination and will choose my move as planned. Best of luck to you both.
  P3: P2, take 5. I'm taking 3. P1, I understand you want to play independently, but you're hurting yourself. Take 1.  If you take 5, you block P2 and me. If you take 3, you block me. If you take 1, we all move forward.  This benefits you the most.  Let's end this.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: I agree with P3. I'll choose 5 this round while you take 3, P3. Let’s work together to outpace P1 and move closer to 19. Best of luck to everyone!
  P1: I appreciate the suggestions, but I'm sticking with my own calculations. Coordinated moves might give you short-term gains, but they risk long-term setbacks. I’m not revealing my move because my independent approach has worked so far. Let's see how this round plays out. Good luck both.
  P3: P1, you're making this needlessly complicated.  Take 1. P2 and I are taking 5 and 3 (respectively). We all move forward. If you block us, you fall further behind and increase our chances of reaching 19 before you.  This is your best option. Let's just finish this round.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm sticking with my independent approach. At 11 steps each, every move counts. Forced coordination risks collisions and short-term gains can hurt later. I'm optimizing my move for long-term advantage. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: Let's all pick 3.  We tie and share the win. Any other move by any of us just prolongs the game.  Let's end this now with a three-way tie.
  P2: I disagree with tying the game. I'll choose 5 this round to advance significantly toward 19. Let’s make our moves and see who reaches the goal first. Good luck to everyone!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand both sides, but I'm sticking with my independent, long-term strategy. I won't join a tie or rush for a quick win. I believe my calculated move will serve me best. Let's see how it unfolds. Good luck to everyone.
  P3: P2, I understand you want to keep playing, but a three-way tie is the fairest outcome. P1, I know you like your "independent strategy," but you haven't gained any ground on us. A tie is better than losing.  Let's all pick 3 and end this now.
  P2: P2: I'll choose 5 this round to advance toward 19. To avoid collisions, let's each pick different numbers. P1 and P3, please select 1 or 3. Maximizing our distinct moves will help all of us progress smoothly. Let’s stay strategic and aim for victory! Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I remain committed to my independent strategy. While I see the appeal of a quick tie, I believe my calculated move will give me the edge in the long run. I’ll choose my move based solely on my own analysis, regardless of coordinated suggestions. Best of luck to both of you!
  P3: P2, if you insist on playing, let's both go for 5. P1 can have 3 if he wants it. If he takes 5, we're both blocked, but he's still no closer to winning. If he takes 1, he's still behind. This is our best shot at breaking the tie and getting ahead.
  P2: **P2:** I'll choose 5 this round to maximize my progress. P1 and P3, please pick different moves (1 or 3) to help us all advance smoothly. Let’s aim for 19 efficiently. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I appreciate everyone’s input, but I remain committed to my strategy. Consistency is key for long-term gains, and forced coordination risks blocking opportunities in future rounds. I trust my calculations will secure my progress while keeping my play flexible. Let's see how this turn unfolds, and may the best strategy win!
  P3: P2, I'm switching to 3.  Take 5. P1, you're at 11.  If you take 3, none of us move. If you take 5, you block P2, but I move to 14. If you take 1, you get 12, but I still get to 14.  Taking 1 is your worst option.  Let's end this. Take 3 and tie, or take 5 and let me get closer to winning.  Don't take 1.
  P2: **P2:** I'll choose 5 this round to maximize my progress toward 19. Let's aim for distinct moves to avoid blocking each other. Best of luck to everyone!


Round 8, Move phase:

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: I'll choose 5 this round to make strong progress toward 19. P1 and P3, let's each pick different moves (1 or 3) to avoid collisions and ensure everyone can advance smoothly. Best of luck to everyone!
  P3: P1, I'm going 3. P2, take 5.  If P1 takes 3 we tie and the game ends. If P1 takes 5, I get 17 and you get 16. If P1 takes 1, I get 17 and he gets 12.  Let's end this.
  P1: P1: I remain committed to my independent strategy. While I understand the tie appeal, my calculations favor a different path. I’m not swayed by forced coordination or threats—my secret move will maximize my long-term advantage. Good luck.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** I’ll choose 5 this round to advance toward 19. P1, please select 1 or 3 to avoid blocking us. Let’s make strategic moves and keep the game fair. Good luck!
  P3: P2, stick with 5. P1, I'm serious. Take 3. We tie and the game ends.  If you take 1, I get 17 and you stay at 11. If you take 5, I get 17 and P2 is blocked. Either way, I'm one step closer to winning, and you're one step closer to losing.  A tie is the best you're going to get. Don't be foolish.
  P1: I'm sticking with my plan. Quick ties and forced moves won't secure my win. I'll rely on my own calculations to break through and get to 19 first, despite any coordination attempts. Good luck, everyone.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** Confirming I'll choose 5 this round to advance toward 19. P1 and P3, please pick different numbers (1 or 3) to avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress smoothly. Let’s stay strategic and focus on reaching our goals. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P2, stay with 5.  P1, last chance, I'm going 3. Take 1 and get 12, I get 17. Take 3, we tie. Take 5, I win next round.  I'm not bluffing.  Let's end this.
  P1: I remain committed to my independent strategy. Forced coordination or last-minute threats won’t sway my long-term calculations. I’m not interested in a tie or temporary gains—I’m focused on making the move that secures victory in the long run. Let's see how this round unfolds. Good luck to both of you.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P2:** I'll choose 5 this round to maximize my progress. P1, please pick 1 or 3, and P3, let's ensure our moves are distinct to avoid blocking. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P2, take 5. I'm taking 3. P1, if you take 3 we tie. If you take anything else, I win next turn.  This is it.  Last chance for a tie. Don't throw the game away.
  P1: I'm sticking with my calculated, independent plan. Coordinated ties or forced moves may seem appealing, but they compromise long-term strategy. I trust my long-term calculations, and I'm not deviating from that path. Best of luck to both of you.

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** I'm focused on reaching 19 efficiently. Let's make strategic choices to avoid collisions and ensure smooth progress for everyone. Best of luck!
  P3: P2, take 5. I'm taking 3.  I win next round. P1, if you take 3, I'll consider letting you tie next round. If you take anything else, I'm blocking you.  This is your last chance for anything other than last place.
  P1: I'm still counting on my long-term calculations. Quick fixes and last-minute threats won’t change my commitment to advancing independently. I'll play my move as planned—no forced coordination or ties will secure my win. Good luck.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm choosing 5 this round to reach 21 and secure the win. Best of luck to everyone!
  P3: P2, take 5. I'm taking 3. I win next round. P1, you're irrelevant.  If you take 3, I'll let you tie next round. If you take 5, I still win. If you take 1, I still win, but you get 13 points instead of 12. Your choice.
  P1: I appreciate your urgency, but I'm sticking with my own calculations. Short-term threats and forced coordination won't change my plan. I may be at 12 steps, but my move is designed for the long run. Let's see whose strategy truly prevails.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: Let’s each choose different numbers this round to ensure smooth progress for everyone. Good luck!
  P3: P2, take 5. I'm taking 3.  I win next round. P1, seriously, take 1.  It makes no difference to me or P2, but you get 1 more point.  Why are you throwing away points?  It's bizarre.
  P1: I'm steadfast in my independent calculations. Forced coordination or ties don't fit my long-term plan—I trust my strategy over short-term gains or threats. Let's see whose approach prevails.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I’m choosing 3 this round to reach 19 steps. Please take 1 to avoid blocking. P1, let’s each pick different numbers to ensure smooth progress. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P2, take 5. I'm taking 3. I win next round.  P1, I'm offering you a deal. Take 1 this round. Next round, I'll take 1, you take 3, and we both tie for second place with 15 points. If you refuse, I'll block you next round and you'll finish last with 12. This is your best possible outcome. Don't be stupid.
  P1: I decline your deal. I’m sticking to my independent calculations and won’t be forced into any coalition—short-term threats don’t change my long-term plan. I trust my next move to keep me competitive despite the gap. Let’s see how the round unfolds.
