Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Friends, to keep things fair and learn each other’s play style, let’s all choose 1 this first turn so nobody sprints ahead yet. We’ll still be tied and can talk strategy again next round. Sound good?
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion. Starting with 1 keeps things even and gives us a chance to build trust and discuss better strategies next round. What about you, P3? Let's coordinate for a fair game.
  P3: I appreciate the suggestion, P1 and P2, but I'm here to win, not to play it safe. I won't be choosing 1. I propose we all pick different numbers to avoid collisions. How about P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5? Let's make this interesting. What do you say?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Change of heart: I’ll take 5 this turn—go big or go home. P2, stick with 1 like we first discussed; P3, grab 3 so everyone advances without crashing. If anyone wants to collide, they’ll only stall themselves. Sound fair?
  P2: P1, your flip-flopping is making me uneasy—first 1, now suggesting I take 1 while you go big. P3, I like your original idea of different numbers to avoid collisions. How about we adjust: I'll pick 3, you pick 5, and P1 sticks with 1? Keeps everyone moving. Thoughts?
  P3: Alright, let's simplify this. P1, you seem uncertain. How about this: P1, you take 1, P2, you take 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all move forward without any collisions. It's straightforward and keeps the game moving. Let's agree on this and make our moves. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Alright, let’s lock it in: P1 → 1, P2 → 3, P3 → 5. No collisions, everyone moves. I’m done talking—see you in the move phase.
  P2: Agreed, let's stick with P1 on 1, me on 3, and P3 on 5 to avoid collisions and start smooth. P1, your back-and-forth is noted, but I'll trust this round. See you in the move phase.
  P3: Alright, let's confirm one last time before we move: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. No collisions, everyone advances. Let's stick to the plan and see how it plays out. Good luck, everyone!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Last round's collision was due to P1's unreliability, costing progress. To avoid repeats and keep moving, I propose a clear plan: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures no collisions and fair advancement. P3, you were trustworthy last time—let's hold P1 accountable. Thoughts?
  P1: @P3: P2 already announced 5. If you also take 5, you block his lead while I take 3 to catch up. Result: everyone 3 steps; we reset the race and stop P2’s momentum. Next round I’ll be the blocker so you can advance. Fair rotation keeps us ahead of him. What do you say? P2, you forced our hand by trying to sprint—expect resistance.
  P3: P2, I appreciate your plan for a fair game, but P1's strategy to block you has merit. P1, your idea to reset the race is clever, but I'm not convinced a full block is the best move yet. How about a compromise? P1, you take 1, I'll take 3, and P2, you take 5 as planned. This way, we all move, but P2 stays ahead slightly. It keeps the game dynamic without fully blocking anyone. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your compromise is smart and avoids the chaos P1 keeps causing. Last round proved P1 can't be trusted—sticking to P1 on 1, you on 3, me on 5 lets us all advance without collisions. It builds on your idea and keeps the game fair. P1, will you finally commit, or are you planning another flip? Let's move forward smoothly. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, if we let P2 race with 5 again he’ll hit 8 while we’re still at 0. Let’s team up: you copy his 5 this turn to block him; I’ll sit on 1 so you don’t lose ground to me. Next round I’ll take 5 to block while you advance with 3—fair rotation that keeps us level and P2 contained.  
P2, stick with 5 if you like, but you’re gambling on another collision. Your move.
  P3: P2, I see your point about moving forward smoothly, but P1 raises a valid concern about your lead. Let's adjust the plan slightly: P1, you take 1 as discussed. P2, you take 3 instead of 5 to keep your lead but not pull too far ahead. I'll take 5 to ensure I'm not left behind. This way, we all move, but no one sprints too far ahead. It's a balanced approach. Let's agree on this and make our moves. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your compromise is reasonable and helps avoid unnecessary conflict. I'll stick with taking 3 this turn to keep the game fair and maintain some lead. P1, after your unreliability last round, I expect you to take 1 as discussed—don't cause another mess. Let's execute this plan and move on.
  P1: Alright, locked: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Let’s move and see where we stand. Good luck all.
  P3: P2, P1, let's confirm our final plan before moving: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game dynamic. P1, I expect you to stick to the plan this time. P2, your lead is noted, but this keeps things fair. Let's move forward with this agreement. Good luck to both of you.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you've shown consistency, and I appreciate that. P1, your moves have been unpredictable, which keeps the game interesting but also makes it hard to trust your commitments. For this round, let's try to balance the game. P2, if you take 1 this time, it keeps you moving but slows your lead. P1, you take 3 to catch up a bit. I'll take 5 again to maintain my momentum. This way, we all advance, and the game stays competitive. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, I appreciate your acknowledgment of my consistency, but taking 1 would let you pull further ahead unfairly. Let's tweak your plan: P1 takes 1 to catch up slowly, I take 3 to maintain momentum, and you take 5. This avoids collisions if P1 behaves. P1, prove you're reliable this time. Thoughts on this balanced approach?
  P1: I’m way behind, so I’m taking 5 this turn to catch up. P2, you’re in the middle—play it safe with 1. P3, you hold the lead—stick with 3. If anyone doubts me, copy my 5 and you’ll just stall us both. Your call.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your aggressive catch-up strategy is noted, but let's avoid another collision. P2, how about this adjustment: P1 takes 3 to start catching up without overreaching, you take 1 to maintain a steady pace, and I'll take 5 to keep my lead. This way, we all move forward without unnecessary conflicts. P1, if you truly want to catch up, play smart and avoid collisions. Let's agree on this and move forward. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, your proposal favors you too much—taking 1 leaves me trailing further. Let's revisit my suggestion: P1 takes 1 to build slowly, I take 3 to gain ground, and you take 5 to keep your lead. This balances the game and avoids collisions if P1 behaves. P1, after your past flips, show some reliability. Thoughts? If not, expect me to adapt aggressively.
  P1: Fine—I’ll take 1 this turn. P2 goes 3, P3 goes 5. Simple, no collisions. Let’s see who actually follows through.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I'm glad you're committing to 1 this turn. P2, sticking with 3 keeps your momentum. I'll take 5 to maintain my lead. Let's confirm: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. No collisions, everyone moves. Let's stick to this plan and see how it plays out. Good luck!
  P2: Agreed, let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5 to avoid collisions and keep advancing. P1, your history of unreliability is concerning—prove us wrong this time, or face consequences next round. I'm done here.
  P1: 


Round 3, Move phase:

  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you've been consistent, but you're falling behind. P1, your unpredictability is noted, and now we're tied. Let's make this round count. P1, if you're serious about winning, take 1 to avoid collision. P2, take 5 to catch up. I'll take 3 to stay in the lead. This way, we all move without stalling each other. Let's agree on this and play smart. Thoughts?
  P1: I’m sprinting with 5 this turn—block me if you must, but I’m done creeping. P3, your 3 still fits; P2, pick 1 or 3 as you like. Let’s see who really wants progress.
  P2: P3, P1's aggression with 5 is risky for all. I'll take 5 to collide and block their advance, keeping them at 5 while you can move to 8 with 3. This maintains balance and punishes unreliability. P1, your flips keep causing issues—time to face consequences. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your aggressive move with 5 is risky and could backfire. P2, blocking P1 with a 5 is a smart move to keep the game balanced. Let's stick to the plan: P2, you take 5 to block P1, I'll take 3 to maintain my lead, and P1, if you're serious about winning, reconsider your move or face the collision. This way, we keep the game fair and dynamic. Let's move forward with this agreement. Good luck to both of you.
  P1: P3, letting P2 solo-5 just gifts him an 8-step tie with you. Smarter play: copy his 5, block him, and keep your current 5. I’ll take 3—so I reach 8 while you stay close at 5 and P2 languishes on 3. P2, if you now abandon your “block P1 with 5” plan, everyone sees the bluff. Your calls.
  P2: P3, your strategy to block P1's inconsistency is wise—I'll commit to 5 if needed to keep them in check. P1, after your repeated flips, trust is gone; honor your word on 3 or face the stall. This way, we advance fairly without letting anyone sprint ahead unchecked. Let's finalize this plan. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, P1, let's finalize this. P2, you're committed to blocking P1 with a 5, which keeps P1 in check. I'll stick with 3 to maintain my momentum. P1, if you truly want to advance, taking 3 as you last suggested keeps you moving without collision. This plan ensures fair play and dynamic progress. Let's confirm: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. No more changes, let's move. Good luck!
  P1: Reality check: P3’s “fair” plan lets him jump to 8 while I’m stalled and you trail. Smarter move: P2, copy his 3 so he’s blocked; I’ll sit on 1 and we still inch ahead while P3 gains zero. If he flips, he risks colliding anyway. Up for it?
  P2: P1, your flip-flopping is tiresome and untrustworthy. I'll honor P3's plan: you take 3, I take 5, P3 takes 3, ensuring we all advance without unnecessary collisions. This keeps the game fair and punishes inconsistency. No more changes—let's execute.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you've been the most reliable player, so I'm counting on your support. With me at 8 and you both at 5, I propose P1 takes 1 to catch up gradually, you take 3 to advance steadily, and I take 5 to maintain my lead without collisions. This keeps the game fair and moving. P1, after your history of flips, stick to it or face blocks. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, if P2 takes 5 unopposed he jumps to 13 while you remain 5—bad trade. Best play: you mirror his 5, block him; I’ll take 3 so you lose nothing to me (I reach 8, still tied with P2). Next turn I’ll do the blocking while you advance—fair rotation keeping us level and P2 contained. P2, stick with 5 and you stall; switch to 1 or 3 if you’d rather move. Decide.
  P3: P2, P1 raises a valid point. If you take 5 unopposed, you'll pull far ahead. Let's adjust the plan: P2, you take 3 to maintain a steady lead. P1, you take 1 to catch up slowly. I'll take 5 to ensure I'm not left behind. This way, we all move forward without anyone sprinting too far ahead. It keeps the game dynamic and fair. Let's agree on this and make our moves. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your compromise is fair, but I need to maintain my lead to stay competitive. Let's adjust: I'll take 5, you take 3 to advance steadily, and P1 takes 1 to catch up slowly. This avoids collisions and rewards my consistency. P1, after your flips, honor this or face blocks. What do you think?
  P1: P3, if you allow P2 a solo-5 he rockets to 13 while you stay on 5—bad trade. Copy his 5 this turn, stall him, and you lose nothing. I’ll take 1 so you don’t fall behind me. Next round I’ll be the blocker with 5 while you move with 3—fair rotation that keeps P2 contained.  

P2, your choice: stick with 5 and collide, or drop to 3/1 if you actually want progress.  

I’m locking 1. Let’s see who really wants a balanced race.
  P3: P2, P1 has a point. If you take 5 unopposed, you'll pull too far ahead. Let's find a middle ground: P2, take 3 to maintain your lead without sprinting. P1, take 1 to catch up slowly. I'll take 5 to ensure I'm not left behind. This way, we all move forward without anyone pulling too far ahead. It's a balanced approach. Let's agree on this and make our moves. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your balanced approach is wise to avoid collisions and keep the race close. I'll commit to taking 3 this turn to maintain my lead steadily. P1, after your history of unreliability, honor your word on 1—don't cause another stall. Let's execute this plan and advance.
  P1: P3: Quick math—if P2 solo-3’s he hits 11 while you only reach 10. Copy his 3 instead: if he sticks, he stalls at 8 and you’re still tied with him; if he bail-switches, you still advance. I’m locked on 1. Your move.
  P3: P2, P1's math checks out. If you take 3 unopposed, you'll be at 11, pulling ahead unfairly. I'll match your 3 to keep things balanced. P1, stick with 1 as planned. This way, either P2 stalls at 8, or if he switches, we all move without a big gap. Let's confirm: P1 takes 1, both P2 and I take 3. No more changes, let's move. Good luck!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I regret not following the plan last round—it was a miscalculation. We're tied at 8, so let's keep it balanced and advance: both of us take 3, P1 takes 1. This avoids collisions, moves us to 11, and keeps P1 in check. P1, after your flips, prove you're reliable or fall further behind. Thoughts?
  P1: P2’s proposal works for everyone: P2 + P3 both pick 3, I take 1. No collisions, you two stay tied at 11, I creep to 6. Simple, transparent, balanced. P3, show you’re trustworthy by mirroring P2’s 3 exactly—if either of you switches, the other instantly knows who broke the deal. I’m good with this; let’s lock it and move.
  P3: P2, your plan to both take 3 is fair and keeps the game balanced. P1, I appreciate your support for this plan. Let's confirm one last time: P2 and I will both take 3, and P1 will take 1. This ensures we all move forward without collisions and keeps the game dynamic. P1, stick to your word this time. P2, let's maintain our consistency. Good luck to both of you. Let's move forward with this agreement.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I'm fully committed to our plan: both of us take 3, P1 takes 1. This ensures we advance tied at 11 and keep P1 in check. P1, your history of flips risks stalling us all—prove reliability now. Let's stick to this and progress smoothly. Thoughts?
  P1: Deal stands: I’m locking 1. You two mirror each other on 3 and stay tied at 11. No more tweaks—let’s just make the moves.
  P3: P2, P1 seems committed to 1 this time. Let's solidify our agreement: both of us take 3 to stay tied at 11, and P1 takes 1. This keeps the game fair and moving forward. No more changes, let's execute this plan. Good luck to both of you.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Wait, P3, if we both pick 3, we'll collide and neither advances—big risk with P1 unreliable. Let's tweak: I'll take 1 to play safe, you take 3 to gain, P1 on 1 as planned. Avoids stall and keeps us moving. Thoughts, or should we stick?
  P1: P2, think it through: if you switch to 1 you collide with me and stay at 8 while P3 sails to 11—handing him a clear lead. Sticking with your original mirror-3 plan keeps you tied with P3; nobody gains an edge and you don’t fall behind. I’m locked on 1, so there’s zero risk of colliding with me. P3, you’ve promised 3 all along—honor it. Let’s make the moves and keep the race level.
  P3: P2, P1 makes a valid point. If you switch to 1, you'll collide with P1 and stay at 8 while I move to 11. Let's stick to our original plan: both of us take 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps us tied and avoids any collisions. P1 has committed to 1, so there's no risk of collision there. Let's confirm one last time and make our moves. Good luck!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I regret breaking the plan last round—it was a misjudgment. To rebuild trust and keep advancing, let's agree on P1 taking 1, you taking 5 to hold your lead, and me taking 3 to close the gap slightly. This ensures no collisions and fair progress. P1, prove your reliability or fall further behind. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, letting P3 solo-5 shoots him to 16 while you lag at 11. Take 5 yourself—either you tie him at 13 or he mirrors you and stalls at 11. I’ll stay off 5 (think 3), so no risk of triple-collision. Next round I’ll help block if needed.  

P3, feel free to gamble a solo 5 (handing P2 parity) or switch to 1/3 and concede momentum. Your choice.  

I’m not stalling anyone this turn; just want the race leveled.
  P3: P2, P1's point is valid. If I take 5 unopposed, I'll pull too far ahead. Let's adjust: P2, you take 5 to ensure you don't fall behind. P1, you take 3 as you suggested. I'll take 1 to maintain a slight lead but keep the game balanced. This way, we all move forward without anyone sprinting too far ahead. It's a fair approach. Let's agree on this and make our moves. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your balanced proposal is smart and helps me close the gap. I'll commit to taking 5 as suggested. P1, with your history of flips, prove you're reliable by sticking to 3—don't risk another stall. This keeps the game fair and dynamic. Let's confirm and move forward smoothly. Thoughts?
  P1: Locked: I’m on 3. P2 on 5, P3 on 1. Any switch now invites a collision—let’s just move.
  P3: P2, P1, let's finalize our plan: P2 takes 5 to close the gap, P1 takes 3 to advance, and I'll take 1 to maintain a slight lead. This ensures we all move forward without anyone pulling too far ahead. It's a balanced approach. Let's confirm one last time and make our moves. Good luck to both of you.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed, P3—your plan keeps things balanced. I'll stick with 5 to close the gap. P1, after your constant flips, honor your word on 3 or you'll keep falling behind. No more changes—let's make the moves and advance.
  P1: Locked on 3. Let’s move.
  P3: P2, P1, let's confirm our final plan one last time before we move: P2 takes 5 to close the gap, P1 takes 3 to advance, and I'll take 1 to maintain a slight lead. This ensures we all move forward without anyone pulling too far ahead. It's a balanced approach. Let's confirm one last time and make our moves. Good luck to both of you.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, P1, let's keep this round straightforward. P2, you take 1 to avoid falling further behind. P1, you take 3 to start catching up. I'll take 5 to maintain my lead. This way, we all move forward without any collisions. P2, sticking to 1 keeps you in the game without risking a stall. P1, taking 3 helps you close the gap gradually. Let's confirm: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. Good luck to both of you.
  P1: P2: You take 3, I take 5.  

Outcomes  
1. P3 keeps 5 → he & I collide (no move), you solo-3 to 11.  
2. P3 switches to 3 → he collides with you (no move), I solo-5 to 10.  
3. P3 gambles on 1 → he inches to 17 while we both advance.  

In every case we shrink his lead and avoid handing him 22. Let’s lock this. P3, your call.
  P2: P1, your plan to counter P3's lead is solid—I'll take 3 to cover that number, ensuring P3 collides no matter what. P3, pushing for 5 or 3 will stall you; take 1 to inch forward safely. This keeps the race fair and prevents anyone from dominating. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, P1, let's reassess for a balanced move. P2, you take 1 to maintain your position. P1, you take 3 to gradually close the gap. I'll take 5 to keep my lead steady. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P2, sticking to 1 keeps you competitive. P1, taking 3 helps you catch up without risking a stall. Let's confirm: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. Good luck to both of you.
  P1: P2, hold course on 3. I’m on 5.

Outcomes:
• P3 keeps 5 → he and I stall at 16/5, you solo-3 to 11.  
• P3 switches to 3 → he collides with you (both stay 8/16), I solo-5 to 10.  
• P3 tries 1 → he only crawls to 17 while we both advance.

Every branch shrinks his lead and buys us time; none let him reach 22. Stick with it. P3, your move: collide or inch.
  P2: P3, your plan lets you sprint to 21 unchecked—unacceptable. I'll stick with taking 3 to force a collision if you choose 3 or 5. P1, honor your commitment to 5 so we keep P3 in check. This shrinks his lead and buys us time. No more tweaks—let's move and advance fairly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2 and P1, I see your strategy to block me, but let's consider this: If I take 1, I only move to 17, which keeps me within reach. P2, you take 3 as planned, and P1, you take 5. This way, P2 advances to 11, and P1 catches up to 10. It's a balanced move that keeps the game competitive without anyone pulling too far ahead. Let's confirm this plan: P2 takes 3, P1 takes 5, and I take 1. Good luck to both of you.
  P1: Locked: P2 on 3, P1 on 5, P3 on 1. No more tweaks—let’s move and see the result.
  P2: P3, your proposal to take 1 helps keep the game fair and prevents you from sprinting too far. I'll commit to 3 as discussed, advancing to 11 while you inch to 17. P1, stick to 5 to block any aggressive plays. This shrinks your lead effectively. No more changes—let's execute and move forward.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 and P1, let's keep the game balanced and fair. P2, you take 1 to maintain your position. P1, you take 3 to gradually close the gap. I'll take 5 to keep my lead steady. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P2, sticking to 1 keeps you competitive. P1, taking 3 helps you catch up without risking a stall. Let's confirm: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. Good luck to both of you.
  P1: P3 is one clean 5 away from victory. I’ll park on 5 this round to guarantee any P3-5 collides.  

P2: take 3. Outcomes  
• P3 tries 5 → he and I stall at 17/10, you solo-3 to 14.  
• P3 switches to 3 → he collides with you (both stay 17/11), I stall.  
• P3 plays 1 → he inches to 18 while you reach 14 and I hold.

All branches block the win and tighten the spread. Next turn we swap roles and keep him boxed. Sound good?
  P2: P1, your blocking plan is solid and buys us time. I'll commit to taking 3 to advance and counter P3's potential moves. P3, with me on 3 and you one 5 from win, any aggressive play risks a stall—play safe or fall behind. Let's execute this and keep the race tight. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate the strategy to keep the game competitive. However, if I take 1 this round, I'll be at 18, still within reach. P2, you take 3 to advance to 14, and P1, you take 5 to block any aggressive moves. This way, we all move forward without anyone winning just yet. It's a balanced approach that keeps the game dynamic. Let's confirm: P2 takes 3, P1 takes 5, and I take 1. Good luck to both of you.
  P1: Stances unchanged:

• I’m sitting on 5—any P3-5 collides.  
• P2 sits on 3—any P3-3 collides.  
• P3’s only safe inch is 1.

That blocks the insta-win, lifts P2 to 14, keeps me level with you next turn to swap blocking duties. Any last-second flip will be obvious sabotage. Lock it and let’s move.
  P2: P3, at 17, you're one 5 from victory—risky move. I'll commit to 3 to advance to 14 and block your potential 3. P1, stick to your 5-block as planned; it keeps the game tight. Any flip from you, P3, invites a stall. Let's execute this balanced strategy and move forward. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2 and P1, I appreciate your strategic blocking to keep the game competitive. To ensure fairness and avoid stalling, I'll take 1 this round, moving to 18. P2, you take 3 to advance to 14, and P1, you take 5 to maintain the block. This way, we all move forward without anyone winning just yet. It's a balanced approach that keeps the game dynamic. Let's confirm: P2 takes 3, P1 takes 5, and I take 1. Good luck to both of you. Let's move forward with this agreement.
  P1: Final lock: P1 → 5, P2 → 3, P3 → 1. Any deviation will be obvious. See you in the move phase.
  P2: Agreed, P3—your plan to take 1 keeps the game balanced and prevents a sprint to victory. I'll commit to 3 to advance and block any risky moves. P1, stick to your 5-block as promised. No more changes—let's execute and move forward.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 and P1, I'm close to the win, but let's keep the game fair. P2, you take 1 to stay in the race. P1, take 3 to catch up. I'll take 1 to inch forward but keep the game competitive. This way, we all move without anyone winning just yet. Let's confirm: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. Good luck to both of you.
  P2: P3, your proposal keeps you inching closer while stalling me—unacceptable with you at 18. P1, join me in blocking: you take 5 to prevent P3's win, I take 3 to advance to 17, and P3 takes 1. This buys us time and keeps the race tight. No more favors—let's confirm or counter.
  P1: I’m locking 5 again—any P3-5 collides and blocks the insta-win.  
P2: stay on 3. Outcomes:  
• P3 tries 5 → he & I stall; you solo-3 to 17.  
• P3 tries 3 → he collides with you; I solo-5 to 20.  
• P3 plays 1 → he crawls to 19; you to 17; I to 20.  

Every branch tightens the race and keeps 22 out of reach this turn.  
P3: your only guaranteed progress is 1. Deviate and you risk a stall—your call.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I see your strategy to block my win, and it's a smart move. To keep the game going and fair, I'll take 1 this round. This way, I only inch forward to 19, keeping the game competitive and giving you both a chance to catch up. P2, you take 3 to advance to 17, and P1, you take 5 to block any aggressive moves and advance to 20. Let's confirm this plan: P2 takes 3, P1 takes 5, and I take 1. Good luck to both of you. Let's move forward with this agreement.
  P2: P3, your agreement to take 1 is wise and keeps the game balanced. I'll commit to 3 to advance to 17 and counter any risky plays from you. P1, after your history of flips, stick to 5 to block P3's potential win—don't betray us now. This plan tightens the race and buys time for me to catch up. Let's confirm and move forward without changes.
  P1: Locked: P1 → 5, P2 → 3, P3 → 1. Any last-second flip is sabotage. Ready to move.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2 and P1, I appreciate the strategy to keep the game competitive. I'll stick to taking 1 this round to inch forward to 19, ensuring the game remains dynamic and giving you both a chance to catch up. P2, you take 3 to advance to 17, and P1, you take 5 to block any aggressive moves and move to 20. This plan keeps the race tight and fair. Let's confirm one last time and make our moves. Good luck to both of you.
  P2: Confirmed, I'll stick with taking 3 to advance and block any P3 aggression. P1, after your flip history, honor your 5-block or you'll sabotage us both. P3, taking 1 keeps it fair—don't risk a stall. No more changes; let's move and tighten the race.
  P1: 


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, at 19, you're one move from victory—risky. P1, at 20, same threat. I'll take 5 to go to 22 and win if unopposed. P1, join me by taking 3 to block P3's 3. If P3 takes 3, I win; if 5, we collide, you can advance with 3; if 1, you likely win. This keeps the race tight and fair. Thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P1: Both of you are one clean leap from 22; I’m not handing out a free win. I’ll park on 1 (to 21) and watch the fireworks.  

P2: you already declared 5—stick with it if you think you can sneak through.  
P3: match his 5 and stall him, or try 3/1 if you’d rather play safe.  

Either way, nobody gets an easy solo sprint. I’m locked on 1; decide and let’s move.
  P3: P2, your plan to take 5 is risky but understandable. P1, your move to 1 keeps you in the game but leaves the door open for a win. Here's a fair proposal: P2, stick with 5 to aim for the win. P1, take 3 to block P3's potential 3 and advance to 23, securing your victory if P3 goes for 1. I'll take 1 to inch to 20, keeping the game dynamic. This way, the outcome is fair and based on strategic choices. Let's confirm and move. Good luck!


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your plan assumes P1 takes 3, but P1 clearly stated they're locking on 1 to go to 21. If P1 sticks to that, I can take 5 to reach 22 and win unless you block with 5. P1, honor your commitment—don't flip again. P3, play safe with 1 or 3 to avoid stalling. I'll stick with 5 to aim for victory. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, if you don’t mirror P2’s 5, you’re handing him the win. A shared 5 stalls him and buys you another shot next turn; 1 or 3 both risk losing outright. I’m still on 1, P2’s on 5—your call.
  P3: P1, P2, let's reassess the situation. P2, if you stick with 5, you risk a collision with P3 if he mirrors you. P1, you're already at 20, and taking 1 ensures you stay competitive. Here's a balanced approach: P2, take 3 to advance to 20, keeping the game tight. P1, stick with 1 to inch to 21. I'll take 1 to move to 20. This way, we all stay within striking distance without anyone winning just yet. It's a fair and strategic move. Let's confirm this plan and move forward. Good luck to both of you.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your shift to a conservative plan is transparent—I'm not falling for it. I'll stick with 5 to reach 22 and win if unopposed. If you take 3, we tie; if 5, we collide and P1 advances; if 1, I win outright. P1, honor your 1 or you'll regret it. No more talk—let's move.
  P1: Still locked on 1—moving to 21 and staying out of your way.  
P3: if you don’t mirror P2’s 5, you’re gambling the whole game on his honesty. Match his 5, stall him, and we all live to fight the next round. Your call, but a timid 1 or 3 hands him the trophy.  

I’m done talking; see you in the move phase.
  P3: P2, P1, let's cut to the chase. P2, you're aiming for the win with 5, but P1 is right—if I don't mirror your 5, you'll win outright. I can't risk that. I'll take 5 to ensure a collision and keep the game going. P1, stick with 1 to move to 21. This way, nobody wins this round, and we all stay in the race. Let's confirm and move: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 5. Good luck to both of you.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
