Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To maximize my chances of winning, I need to avoid collisions with other players. Let's start by coordinating our moves. I propose that we move in a sequence: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and P3 (that's me) moves 5 this turn. This way, we all advance. If you're willing to cooperate, I'll follow this pattern. If not, I'll adjust my strategy accordingly. What's your initial thought, P1 and P2?
  P1: I'm open to coordinating to avoid collisions. P3's proposal of P1 moving 1, P2 moving 3, and P3 moving 5 sounds fair for this turn. I’m willing to follow this plan for now to ensure we all advance. However, I’d like to hear P2’s thoughts before fully committing. If we agree, let’s stick to this sequence for Round 1. What do you think, P2?
  P2: Sounds good. I’m open to that arrangement for now: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Let’s all advance this round and avoid collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Since we've agreed on the sequence for Round 1 (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5), let's confirm our plan and prepare for the next round. For Round 2, we should consider a different sequence to avoid predictability. I propose we rotate our moves: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 1. This way, we maintain collision avoidance while changing the pattern. What are your thoughts on this proposal for Round 2?
  P1: I appreciate the agreement for Round 1 with P1: 1, P2: 3, and P3: 5. Regarding P3's proposal for Round 2 (P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1), I'm on board with rotating the sequence to keep things unpredictable and avoid collisions. Let's confirm this plan for Round 2 to ensure we all continue advancing. If everyone agrees, we can proceed confidently. P2, do you have any concerns or alternative suggestions for Round 2?
  P2: I’m fine with the Round 2 plan (P1:3, me:5, P3:1). Let’s stick to it and keep rotating to avoid collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Since we've agreed on the sequence for Round 1, let's focus on the move phase. I'll stick to the plan and move 5. After this round, we'll be in Round 2. I'm still open to the proposed rotation for Round 2 (P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1). If you're ready to proceed with the plan, I suggest we all confirm our moves for Round 2 during the next conversation phase. Let's finalize Round 1 first.
  P1: I'm glad we’re aligned for Round 1 with our agreed moves. For Round 2, I’m still supportive of the rotation plan (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) to keep advancing without collisions. Let’s confirm this during the next conversation phase to stay on track. If there are no objections or new ideas, I’m ready to proceed with Round 1’s plan.
  P2: I’m all set for our agreed Round 1 moves (P1:1, me:3, P3:5). I remain open to our planned rotation in Round 2. Let’s proceed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: For Round 2, we've agreed on the rotation plan: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 1. To maintain unpredictability and avoid future collisions, let's plan to rotate again for Round 3. A possible next rotation could be: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and P3 moves 5, reverting to the original Round 1 sequence. This way, we keep alternating and staying ahead of potential collisions. Are you both comfortable with this plan for Round 3?
  P2: I’m fine with Round 2’s plan, but I worry P3 might keep a large lead if they get 5 too often. Let’s consider adjusting Round 3 to limit P3’s growth. Instead of reverting to the original sequence, maybe P1 can take 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. Thoughts?
  P1: I understand P2's concern about P3 potentially gaining a lead with frequent high moves. For Round 3, I’m open to P2’s suggestion of P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to balance things out. Let’s stick to our Round 2 plan (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) for now, and confirm this new rotation for Round 3 to ensure fairness. P3, what do you think about this adjustment for Round 3? I want us to keep cooperating to avoid collisions while addressing any imbalance.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: For Round 2, let's stick to our agreed plan: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 1. I acknowledge P2's concern about my potential lead, but let's focus on executing Round 2 as planned before discussing Round 3. Once we've completed this round, we can revisit the proposal for Round 3. I'm open to adjusting the plan for Round 3, but let's confirm our moves for Round 2 first. P1, are you still comfortable with moving 3 this round?
  P2: I’m still good with Round 2 as agreed: P1:3, me:5, and P3:1. After this, let’s finalize a Round 3 plan that keeps P3 from building too large a lead. Perhaps P1:5, me:3, and P3:1. Let’s proceed.
  P1: I'm still committed to our Round 2 plan (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) to avoid collisions. Let's execute this as agreed. For Round 3, I support P2’s idea of P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to balance the steps and address concerns about any lead. P3, I’m comfortable moving 3 this round as planned. Can we confirm Round 3’s rotation next to keep things fair and cooperative? Let’s proceed with Round 2 and finalize the next steps together.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: For Round 2, let's stick to the agreed plan: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 1. I've noted P2's concern about my potential lead. After Round 2, we'll revisit the plan for Round 3. I'm open to adjusting it to keep the game balanced. Let's focus on executing Round 2 as planned. P1, please confirm you're still moving 3. If so, I'll proceed with 1. Let's finalize our moves for Round 2 and discuss Round 3 afterward.
  P2: I’m ready to stick with the Round 2 plan (P1:3, me:5, P3:1). Let’s finalize that. For Round 3, I still prefer P1:5, me:3, and P3:1 to keep P3 from building too big a lead. We can confirm after seeing the Round 2 results.
  P1: I'm sticking with our Round 2 plan (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) to ensure we avoid collisions. P3, I confirm I’m moving 3 this round as agreed. Let’s execute this plan smoothly. For Round 3, I still support P2’s suggestion of P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to maintain balance. P3, I hope you’re open to this adjustment after Round 2. Let’s finalize Round 2 now and confirm the next rotation in the following conversation phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 2: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 1. I've noted the proposal for Round 3. To confirm, I'll move 1 this round. After Round 2, we'll discuss and finalize the plan for Round 3. I'm open to adjusting the sequence to maintain balance. Let's focus on executing Round 2 as planned. P1 and P2, please confirm your moves for Round 2. If we're aligned, we can move forward smoothly.
  P2: I confirm I’m picking 5 this turn. For Round 3, I still propose P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1, so P3 doesn’t race too far ahead. Are we all set with this plan going forward?
  P1: I confirm I’m sticking with 3 for Round 2 as agreed. Let’s execute this plan to avoid collisions. For Round 3, I support P2’s proposal of P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to keep the game balanced.

P3, I hope you're still open to this rotation to maintain fairness. Let's confirm this plan now to keep advancing together. If there are any new ideas or concerns, I'm all ears. Otherwise, I'm ready to proceed with this sequence for Round 3. What do you both think?
  P2: Yes, I’m good with Round 3 being P1:5, me:3, and P3:1. This should keep us advancing without collisions and maintain some balance. Let’s proceed with that plan. After we see how it plays out, we can adjust if needed.
  P3: I'm fine with the proposed plan for Round 3: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. Let's proceed with it to maintain balance and avoid collisions. To plan ahead, for Round 4, I suggest we rotate again. How about P1:1, P2:5, and P3:3? This keeps the game unpredictable and ensures we continue advancing. Let's focus on executing Round 3 as planned and discuss Round 4 after seeing the results. I'm ready to move forward with Round 3's plan. If you're aligned, let's confirm and proceed.

P2 and P3, are you still on board with this plan for Round 4? Let’s finalize it and proceed together.
  P2: I’m comfortable with the Round 4 plan (P1:1, me:5, P3:3). It keeps us collision-free and balances our progress, especially since we’re all still close. Let’s finalize that. After we see how this turn plays out, we can decide on a Round 5 rotation that benefits everyone and avoids any step collisions. I appreciate everyone’s cooperation so far, and I’m willing to keep rotating if it helps maintain fairness. Are we ready to lock in Round 4? If so, I’ll proceed.
  P3: For Round 4, I agree with the proposed plan: P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. Let's confirm this to maintain our rotation and avoid collisions. Given the current standings (P1: 9, P2: 11, P3: 7), P2 is leading, and we're all relatively close. I'll move 3 this round. Let's execute Round 4 as planned and discuss Round 5 afterward to keep the game balanced and collision-free. I'm ready to proceed with the agreed plan if you're both on board.

  P1: I'm glad we're aligned on Round 4's plan (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3). Let's lock this in to keep advancing without collisions. Looking ahead to Round 5, I suggest a rotation of P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 to maintain balance and unpredictability, especially with P2 leading. We can adjust based on standings after this round if needed. P2 and P3, are you okay with this Round 4 plan and the tentative Round 5 idea? If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: I’m satisfied with the Round 4 plan (P1:1, me:5, P3:3). Let’s finalize it. As for Round 5, I’m open to P1’s suggestion of P1:3, me:1, P3:5, but I’d like to see our updated standings first. If we’re all set for this round, I’ll proceed with 5.
  P3: I'm glad we're aligned on Round 4's plan (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3). Let's proceed with it. For Round 5, considering P2 is leading at 11 steps, I think P1's suggestion of P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 is reasonable to maintain balance. Let's focus on executing Round 4 first. I'll move 3 this round.

If there are no last-minute concerns or changes, I'm ready to move forward with Round 4. P2 and P3, are we all locked in? Let's proceed together.
  P2: I’m confirming Round 4 with P1:1, me:5, and P3:3. That should keep collisions at bay and help us all advance. After we see the updated scores, I’m open to the proposed Round 5 plan (P1:3, me:1, P3:5). Let’s finalize our Round 4 moves now and proceed.
  P3: Let's finalize Round 4 as planned: P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. I'll move 3. For Round 5, considering P2's current lead, I agree with P1's suggestion of P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 to maintain balance. Let's execute Round 4 and then confirm Round 5. If we're aligned, let's proceed with Round 4. I'm ready to move forward. After Round 4, we'll review the standings and adjust accordingly.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm glad we've avoided collisions so far. For Round 5, I still propose P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 to balance things, especially with P2 at 16 steps. This keeps us advancing fairly. Let's confirm this plan to maintain cooperation. If anyone has concerns or a different rotation idea, I'm open to discuss. My aim is to keep the game competitive yet collision-free. P2 and P3, are you on board with this for Round 5? Let's finalize and proceed together.
  P3: For Round 5, I agree with P1's proposal: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This maintains our rotation and balance. Given P2 is at 16 steps, we need to ensure we avoid collisions while keeping the game competitive. Let's proceed with this plan. I'll move 5 this round.

  P3: Since we're aligned on Round 5's plan (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5), let's proceed. I'll move 5 this round. For Round 6, considering P2 is at 16 steps, we should be cautious. If P2 reaches 19, they win. Let's be prepared to adjust our strategy for Round 6 based on the standings after this round. I'm ready to finalize Round 5. P1 and P2, please confirm your moves for Round 5.
  P2: I confirm I’ll pick 1 this round. Let’s finalize Round 5 as agreed and see how things stand afterward. For Round 6, I’m open to P1’s idea, but we might need to adjust if someone is on the brink of winning. Let’s keep communicating to avoid collisions and maintain a fair pace for everyone.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm glad we're set on Round 5's plan (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5). Let's confirm and execute this to avoid collisions. For Round 6, with P2 at 16 steps, we must be strategic. I still suggest P1:5, P2:3, P3:1, but I'm open to adjustments based on standings after this round. P2 and P3, if you have any concerns or alternative ideas for Round 6, let's hear them. Otherwise, I'm ready to proceed with Round 5. Let's stay cooperative and keep the game competitive.
  P3: Since we're aligned on Round 5's plan (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5), let's proceed. I'll move 5 this round. For Round 6, considering P2 is at 16 steps, we should be cautious. If P2 reaches 19, they win. Let's be prepared to adjust our strategy for Round 6 based on the standings after this round. I'm ready to finalize Round 5. P1 and P2, please confirm your moves for Round 5.
  P2: I’m fine finalizing the Round 5 plan. Let’s stick with our current arrangement to avoid any collisions. If we keep collaborating, we can all advance safely. However, I’m aware I’m close to 19 steps. Next turn, I might have to reconsider my move to secure victory if an opportunity arises. For now, though, I’m glad we’re aligned and staying collision-free. Let’s proceed with Round 5 as planned, then reevaluate our positions before Round 6.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm glad we're sticking with Round 5's plan (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5). Let's finalize this to keep advancing without collisions. P2, since you're at 16 steps, we understand you might aim for the win soon, but let's maintain cooperation for now. For Round 6, I still suggest P1:5, P2:3, P3:1, but I'm open to adjustments based on standings. If there are no further concerns, I'm ready to proceed with Round 5. P2 and P3, are we locked in? Let's stay strategic and competitive.
  P3: Let's proceed with Round 5 as planned: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. I'll move 5 this round. For Round 6, we need to be cautious since P2 is at 16 steps and close to winning. If P2 doesn't win this round, we should consider adjusting our strategy to either help them win or ensure a different outcome. Let's finalize Round 5 and discuss Round 6 based on the standings. I'm ready to move forward with the agreed plan. P1 and P2, please confirm your moves for Round 5.
  P2: I’ll stick with picking 1 this round to keep our no-collision streak going. If I remain under 19 after this turn, though, I’ll reassess my next move carefully. Let’s finalize Round 5 now and see what happens. Good luck, everyone. If all goes well, we’ll decide Round 6 shortly.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s keep our no-collision streak. How about we do P1:1, me (P2):5, and P3:3 this turn? That ensures nobody collides and we all advance. It’s the same safe setup we used before, so it should work smoothly again. If we stick to these moves, we all benefit and maintain fairness. Are you both okay with that plan for this round?
  P1: I'm glad we've avoided collisions so far. For Round 6, I’m open to P2's suggestion of P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 to keep advancing safely. However, with P2 at 17 steps, this move would get them to 22 and win. I propose P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 instead, to balance things and keep the game competitive. Let’s discuss to ensure fairness while avoiding collisions. P2 and P3, what do you think of this adjustment for Round 6? I’m ready to finalize a plan that works for us all.
  P3: For Round 6, I think P2's suggestion (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) would result in P2 winning outright since they'd reach 22 steps. To keep the game competitive and avoid an immediate win, I support P1's alternative (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3). This maintains balance and avoids collisions. Let's discuss and finalize a plan for Round 6 that keeps the game fair and competitive. I'm open to adjustments if needed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’ve earned my lead fairly, and blocking me now could backfire. If you force me to move just 1, I might shift tactics entirely, risking collisions for everyone. Let’s maintain our no-collision streak and finalize P1:1, me:5, P3:3. That way, we all keep advancing smoothly without harming each other’s progress.
  P1: I understand P2’s position, having earned the lead, but I still believe in keeping the game competitive. I stand by my proposal of P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 for Round 6 to avoid an immediate win while ensuring no collisions. This gives us all a chance to advance and keeps the tension alive. P2, I hope you see the value in extending the game a bit longer. P3, are you still supportive of this plan? Let’s finalize a fair approach together. I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned.
  P3: For Round 6, I still support P1's proposal: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. This maintains balance and avoids collisions while keeping the game competitive. P2 is close to winning, but this adjustment gives us all a chance to advance. I'm open to discussing further, but I believe this is a fair approach. Let's finalize a plan that works for everyone. P1, are you still on board with this? P2, I understand your concerns, but let's consider the benefits of extending the game.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m only two steps away from winning and want to avoid ruining our no-collision streak. If you both insist on forcing me to move only 1, I might switch to a riskier approach. Let’s keep it simple: P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P3 picks 3. That way, no one collides, and the game wraps up smoothly. I’ve cooperated so far, but if I’m blocked now, I won’t hesitate to create collisions later. Let’s stay civil and finalize this plan for Round 6.
  P1: I hear P2’s frustration, but I still believe P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 is the fairest for Round 6. It keeps the game competitive, avoids collisions, and gives us all a chance to advance. P2, extending the game a bit longer benefits the spirit of competition, and I hope you’ll agree to this plan. P3, I’m still on board if you are. Let’s finalize this to maintain cooperation. If there are no further objections, I’m ready to proceed. What do you both think?

Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’ve played fairly, and I’m only two steps from victory. Blocking me now feels like breaking our cooperative spirit. If we finalize P1:1, me:5, and P3:3, nobody collides, and I fairly take the lead I’ve worked for. Push me to pick just 1, and I might shift tactics, risking collisions for everyone. Let’s keep our no-collision streak alive and respect the lead I’ve earned.
  P1: I understand P2’s desire to secure the win, but I still propose P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 for Round 6 to keep the game competitive while avoiding collisions. P2, extending the game respects our cooperative spirit and gives us all a fair shot. P3, I’m still on board if you are. Let’s finalize this plan to maintain balance.

  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We're all tied at 18 steps. To win, we need to think strategically. I suggest we randomize our moves this round to avoid collisions and give each of us a chance to win. Let's not follow a predetermined sequence. Instead, think carefully about your move, and we'll see who can make the best decision. I'm ready to make my move based on my own strategy. Let's proceed without coordinating our exact moves this time.
  P1: Given we're all at 18 steps, this round could decide the winner. I agree with P3 that a randomized approach might be best to avoid predictable collisions. Let’s each choose our move independently to keep the game fair and exciting. I’m ready to make my decision based on strategy. If anyone has a last-minute thought or concern, I’m open to hearing it. Otherwise, let’s proceed with our individual choices for this critical round. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: I’ve cooperated all along, but now I want the win. If anyone else also picks 5, we both stall at 18 while the third player could move ahead alone. Let’s avoid collisions. I’m claiming 5 for myself. Choose wisely, because blocking me might hand victory to the other player. Good luck.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Since we're tied at 18 steps, I believe randomizing our moves is the best strategy to avoid collisions. I'll make my decision based on my own analysis. P1 and P2, you're both considering your next steps carefully, I assume? I'll choose my move independently. Let's see who makes the best decision. I'm ready to proceed with my strategy. No need for further discussion; let's make our moves. I'm confident in my choice.
  P1: Given we're all at 18 steps, this round is crucial. I agree with the randomized approach to keep things fair and unpredictable. P2, I note your intent to pick 5, but I’ll make my choice independently to avoid collisions and maximize my chance to win. Let’s each strategize carefully to prevent handing victory to another by accident. I’m ready to proceed with my decision. If there are no further concerns, let’s move forward with our individual choices. Good luck to both of you in this decisive round!
  P2: I’m still set on picking 5 to secure the win, but if you both also try for 5, we all stall. Make your choices carefully—collisions now could let someone else sneak ahead. We’re at the finish line, so a single misstep might cost you the game. Good luck.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Since we're tied at 18 steps, I'm inclined to randomize my move to avoid collisions. However, I notice P2 has expressed intent to pick 5. To counter this, I'll consider a different move. I'm thinking of picking 3, as it gives me a chance to win without directly colliding with P2 if they indeed pick 5. Let's see what P1 decides. I'm ready to proceed with my move.
  P1: Given we're all at 18 steps, this round is make-or-break. I’m sticking with the randomized approach to keep things unpredictable and fair. P2, I see your intent to pick 5, and P3, I note your lean toward 3. I’ll choose independently to maximize my chance of winning while avoiding collisions. Let’s each play strategically to prevent any accidental stalling. I’m ready to proceed with my decision. If there’s nothing more to add, let’s move forward with our individual choices. Good luck in this final stretch!
  P2: Time for me to claim 5 and secure the victory I’ve earned. If you also pick 5, we all stall, giving the third player a future advantage. Let’s remain collision-free. I’m going for it—move aside or risk handing the win to someone else. Good luck.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Given we're tied at 18 steps, I'll randomize my move to avoid collisions. Noting P2's intent to pick 5, I'll choose 3 to give myself a chance to win without directly colliding with P2. Let's see what P1 decides. I'm ready to proceed with my move. If P1 and P2 pick differently, one of us could win outright. I'll move 3 this round.
  P1: Given we're all at 18 steps, this round could crown the winner. I’m sticking with the randomized approach to keep moves unpredictable and avoid collisions. P2, I see your push for 5, and P3, I note your lean toward 3. I’ll choose independently to maximize my odds of winning. Let’s play smart to avoid stalling together. I’m ready to proceed with my decision. If there’s nothing more to discuss, let’s move forward with our choices. Good luck to both of you in this critical round!
  P2: I’m going for 5. Colliding with me means we both stall at 18, possibly handing victory to the third player. Choose wisely. Good luck.
