Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. That way we all advance this turn. We can rotate next. Thoughts?
  P3: That works for me this round—I'll take 1. Let's see if we can keep rotating fairly so we all make progress.
  P2: P1's plan sounds good to me. I'll take 3 this round as suggested. Let's confirm and move on. P1, P3, are we all set?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Yes, we're all set—I'll take 5 as planned. Let's proceed without collisions and discuss rotation next round.
  P3: Looking forward to seeing if this coordination works out. If everyone follows through, let's rotate next round: I’ll take 3, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5. Fair and balanced. Sound good?
  P2: Let's confirm one last time before we move: P1 takes 5, I (P2) take 3, and P3 takes 1. If we all stick to this, we should advance smoothly. For the next round, we can discuss further rotation. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed, P2—sticking to the plan: me (P1) 5, you 3, P3 1. For next round, let's rotate to P1 3, P2 1, P3 5 to keep it balanced.
  P3: Looks like we’re all aligned for this round—let’s stick to the plan and see how it plays out. If it works, I’m on board to rotate fairly next round as discussed. Let’s build some trust early.
  P2: Alright, let's wrap up the conversation for this round. We have a solid plan: P1 takes 5, I (P2) take 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's execute this and see how it goes. For future rounds, we can adjust based on how well we stick to our agreements. Trust is key here. Let's move forward with our plan.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's continue building trust with a fair rotation. Last round: P1 5, P2 3, P3 1. For this round, how about P1 3, P2 5, P3 1? That keeps us progressing without anyone surging too far ahead early. P2 and P3, thoughts? We can adjust based on agreement.
  P3: That rotation works for me—P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, I’ll take 1 again this round. If we all stick to it, we can keep progressing without collisions. Let’s keep the trust going.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the continued effort to coordinate. I'm on board with the suggested rotation for this round: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us moving forward without collisions. Let's confirm this plan and stick to it. Trust and fair play will benefit us all in the long run. Looking forward to a smooth round. P1, P3, any final thoughts before we move?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed, P2 and P3—let's stick to the plan: me (P1) 3, P2 5, P3 1. This ties P2 and me at 8, keeps P3 progressing. For next round, perhaps P1 1, P2 3, P3 5 to rotate fully? No other thoughts—ready to move.
  P3: Sounds good—let’s stick to the rotation as discussed: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, I (P3) take 1 this round. If everyone follows through again, we’ll build real trust and keep rotating fairly. Next round, I’m happy to take 5 as suggested. Let’s keep the momentum going.
  P2: Great, it looks like we have a solid plan for this round. Just to reiterate quickly: I (P2) will take 5, P1 will take 3, and P3 will take 1. This should keep us all moving forward without any collisions. Let's stick to this plan and build on the trust we've established. If everyone follows through, we can continue this fair rotation in future rounds. Looking forward to a smooth execution. Any final confirmations or thoughts before we move?

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, it seems there was a misunderstanding last round. We need to ensure we stick to our agreements to avoid collisions. Let's reset and coordinate again. How about this round: P1 takes 1, I (P2) take 3, and P3 takes 5? This way, we can balance out the steps and continue building trust. P1, P3, thoughts?
  P1: P2, your proposal is fair, but P3's deviation last round cost us trust—why did you pick 5 instead of 1, P3? To move forward, let's adjust slightly for balance: P1 takes 5 (to 13), P2 takes 3 (to 6), P3 takes 1 (to 2). This gives everyone progress without collisions and lets P3 prove reliability. If we agree and stick to it, we can rotate again next round. Thoughts?
  P3: I understand the frustration—last round I took 5 to test if others would stick to the plan long-term. Clearly, trust is fragile. I’m willing to rebuild it. This round, I’ll take 1 as suggested by both of you. Let’s stabilize and get back on track. If we can coordinate again, I’m open to fair rotation going forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to rebuild trust. Let's confirm the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, I (P2) take 3, and P3 takes 1. This will help balance our steps and restore coordination. If we all stick to this, we can discuss a fair rotation for the next round. Let's move forward with this plan and ensure smooth progress. Any final thoughts before we proceed?
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate the reset attempt. P3, your "test" last round broke trust and cost progress—let's not repeat that. I'm on board with the plan: me (P1) 5, P2 3, you (P3) 1. This balances us somewhat and gives you a chance to prove reliability. If we all stick to it, we can discuss fair rotation next round. No more deviations, or coordination crumbles. Agreed?
  P3: Agreed—I'll take 1 this round as discussed. Let's use this to rebuild trust and get back to smooth coordination. If we all follow through, I’m open to rotating fairly next round, with me taking 3 or 5 depending on balance. Let’s make this work.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I appreciate your commitment to rebuilding trust. Let's confirm one last time: P1 takes 5, I (P2) take 3, and P3 takes 1. This will stabilize our progress. For the next round, let's consider a rotation that keeps us balanced: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. This ensures fairness and continued trust. Let's move forward with our plan and ensure smooth progress. Any final confirmations before we proceed?
  P1: Agreed, P2 and P3—let's confirm and execute: me (P1) 5, P2 3, P3 1. This rebuilds trust and keeps me progressing. For next round, your rotation suggestion (P1 1, P2 5, P3 3) sounds fair—let's discuss after this succeeds. No deviations this time. Ready to move.
  P3: Let’s lock it in: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I (P3) take 1. I’m committed to this move—no surprises. If we all follow through, I’m happy to take 3 next round while P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 5, as suggested. Let’s rebuild trust and keep progressing. Ready to move.


Round 3, Move phase:

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, great job sticking to the plan last round—trust is rebuilding. As discussed, let's go with P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3 this round. That brings us to P1 14, P2 11, P3 5—balanced progress. If we all commit, we can rotate again next: maybe P1 5, P2 3, P3 1? Thoughts? Let's keep coordinating to avoid collisions.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm glad we're back on track with coordination. I agree with P1's suggestion for this round: P1 takes 1, I (P2) take 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us moving forward without collisions. If we all stick to this plan, we can discuss the next rotation as P1 suggested. Let's confirm and move forward. Trust is key, and we're rebuilding it well. Any final thoughts before we proceed?
  P3: Agreed—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, I (P3) take 3 this round. That keeps us all progressing without collisions and shows we can maintain coordination. If this works, I’m open to the next rotation as P1 suggested: P1 5, P2 3, P3 1. Let’s keep the trust going and avoid surprises. Ready to move if you both are.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, thanks for the quick agreements—let's confirm and execute: me (P1) 1, P2 5, P3 3. This keeps us balanced and collision-free. If successful, we'll rotate as discussed next round. No more thoughts—ready to move.
  P2: P2: Great to see we're all aligned for this round. Just to confirm one last time: P1 takes 1, I (P2) take 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us progressing smoothly. Looking forward to a successful round. Let's ensure we stick to the plan and continue building trust. If everyone is ready, let's move forward.
  P3: Thanks for confirming, P1 and P2. I’m locked in for 3 this round as agreed. Let’s keep this coordination going strong—if we all follow through again, it shows we can trust each other long-term. Looking forward to seeing smooth progress this turn. Ready when you are.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed, P2 and P3—final confirmation: me (P1) 1, P2 5, P3 3. Let's execute without issues and continue fair rotation next round. Ready to move.
  P2: P2: Alright, let's wrap up the conversation for this round. We have a solid plan: P1 takes 1, I (P2) take 5, and P3 takes 3. Let's execute this and see how it goes. For future rounds, we can adjust based on how well we stick to our agreements. Trust is key here. Let's move forward with our plan.
  P3: Thanks P1 and P2 for sticking with the plan. I’m locked in for 3 this round as agreed. If this round goes smoothly, I’m happy to continue fair rotations—next round I’ll take 1 while P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 3, as proposed. Let’s keep the trust strong and avoid any surprises. Ready to move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, another betrayal from P3 last round—picking 5 instead of 3, colliding with P2 and stalling progress. P3, your repeated "tests" are destroying trust; explain yourself. To move forward, let's try: me (P1) 5 (to 19), P2 3 (to 9), P3 1 (to 3). This gives everyone progress if we stick to it. P2, thoughts? P3, commit or we cut you out.
  P2: P3, your actions are concerning. Trust is crucial, and your moves are jeopardizing our coordination. Let's reset and commit to the plan: P1 takes 5, I (P2) take 3, and P3 takes 1. This ensures we all progress. If P3 deviates again, we'll have to reconsider including you in future plans. P1, do you agree with this approach? Let's confirm and move forward. Trust needs to be rebuilt, and actions speak louder than words.
  P3: I understand the frustration—my last move was a miscalculation, not betrayal. I’m willing to rebuild trust, and I commit to taking 1 this round as proposed. If P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 3, we all move forward. Let’s stabilize and prove we can still coordinate.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, your "miscalculation" excuse rings hollow after repeated betrayals—it's stalling us all. But fine, let's test your commitment: stick to P1 5, P2 3, P3 1 this round. If you deviate again, P2 and I will coordinate exclusively, leaving you behind. Confirm and let's move—no more games.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your commitment to taking 1 this round. Let's confirm the plan one last time: P1 takes 5, I (P2) take 3, and P3 takes 1. This will help us rebuild trust and ensure smooth progress. If we all stick to this, we can discuss future coordination. P3, your actions will determine our trust in you moving forward. Let's move forward with this plan and ensure a successful round. Any final thoughts before we proceed?
  P3: Understood—I'll take 1 this round as agreed: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I (P3) take 1. I know I’ve hurt trust, but I’m committed to proving reliability from here on. Let’s make this round smooth and rebuild from there. Ready to move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, let's finalize: me (P1) 5, P2 3, P3 1. P3, this is your last chance—deviate and P2 and I will exclude you permanently, coordinating to leave you at 2. Stick to it, and we rebuild. Agreed?
  P2: P3, I hope you understand the gravity of the situation. Trust is fragile, and your actions have put it in jeopardy. Let's move forward with the plan: P1 takes 5, I (P2) take 3, and you (P3) take 1. This is crucial for rebuilding trust. If we all stick to this, we can discuss future coordination. However, any deviation from you, P3, will force P1 and me to coordinate exclusively. Let's ensure a successful round and rebuild trust. Any final confirmations before we proceed?
  P3: Understood—final confirmation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I (P3) take 1. I know I’ve caused setbacks, but I’m committed to rebuilding trust starting now. Let’s execute cleanly this round and move forward with fair coordination. No surprises from me—ready to move.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's repeated betrayals have stalled us all—last round picking 3 instead of 1 collided with P2, proving you're just sabotaging. P3, you're out; P2 and I will coordinate to leave you behind. P2, let's ally: you take 3 (to 9), I'll take 5 (to 24 and win). I'll ensure you get second if needed, but help me end this now without collisions. Thoughts? No more trust for P3.
  P2: P1, I agree with your assessment. P3's actions have made it clear that coordination with them is not viable. Let's proceed with your plan: I'll take 3, and you take 5. This ensures you win, and we can end this game. P3, your actions have led to this exclusion. Let's confirm and move forward, P1.
  P3: P1, P2—I understand your frustration, but locking me out guarantees you both lose flexibility. If P1 wins now, P2 gets nothing. But if we work together, we can stop P1 from reaching 24 and open paths for both of us. I propose this: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, I take 1. P1 ends at 22, not 24. Then we reassess. P2, you gain most from keeping the game alive. Let’s not hand P1 the win.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, don't fall for P3's ploy—they've betrayed us repeatedly, stalling everyone. Their proposal puts me at 22, but they'll likely deviate again to sabotage you or me. Stick with our plan: I take 5 to win at 24, you take 3 to 9. Game ends, and I'll owe you one in spirit—better than letting P3 drag us into endless chaos. P3, your appeals are desperate; you're out. Confirm, P2? Let's end this cleanly.
  P2: P2: P1, I stand by our plan. P3's actions have shown they can't be trusted. Let's confirm: I'll take 3, you take 5. This ends the game cleanly. P3, your attempts to disrupt won't work. We're moving forward without you. Let's finalize and execute. P1, ready to move?
  P3: P2, think carefully—if P1 wins now, you end with just 6 steps and nothing to show for it. But if you and I block P1 by both picking 5, he stays at 19. Then next round, you take 5, I take 1, P1 takes 3—we all progress, and you gain leverage. Don’t hand P1 the win for free. Let’s stop him now and open the game back up.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, ignore P3's desperate lies—they've betrayed us every time, stalling everyone for their own gain. Their "block" plan is just another sabotage; they'll likely pick something else to collide with you alone. Stick to our alliance: I take 5 to win at 24, you take 3 to 9 safely. Game ends, no more chaos from P3. Confirm and let's move—trust me over the proven liar.
  P2: P2: P1, I'm committed to our plan. P3's actions have consistently disrupted our progress. Let's confirm one last time: I'll take 3, you take 5. This ensures a clean end to the game. P3, your proposals are too risky given your history. We're moving forward without you. Let's finalize and execute. P1, ready to move?
  P3: P2, you’re being played. P1 wins and you get nothing—6 steps and a loss. But if we both pick 5, we block P1 at 19. Next round, you take 5 (to 11), I take 1 (to 3), P1 takes 3 (to 22). You gain leverage and a real chance. Why hand P1 the win now? Let’s stop him and open the game back up.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, last round's collision let P3 pull ahead to 7 while we stalled—my fault for switching to 3. To rebuild trust and end the stagnation, let's use the familiar plan: me (P1) 5 (to 24), P2 3 (to 9), P3 1 (to 8). This ensures progress if we commit, and could wrap this up. P3, explain your intentions and commit—no more disruptions. P2, thoughts? Let's confirm and move.
  P2: P1 and P3, given the repeated disruptions, I propose we change our strategy to ensure fair progress. P1, you're close to winning, but let's consider a different approach to avoid further collisions. How about: P1 takes 1, I (P2) take 5, and P3 takes 3? This keeps us all moving forward without giving anyone a decisive advantage. P3, if you're committed to rebuilding trust, let's see if you can stick to this plan. P1, your thoughts on this new rotation?
  P3: P1, P2—I'm willing to commit to P2’s proposal: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, I (P3) take 3. This gives everyone progress and keeps the game alive. If we all stick to it, we avoid collisions and restore some balance. P2, this move benefits you most—don’t let P1 win uncontested. Let’s make this round clean and fair.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, your proposal stalls me at 20 while you catch up, but with P3's history of betrayal, it's risky for you too, P2. Let's stick closer to my plan: me (P1) 5 to win at 24, P2 3 to 9, P3 1 to 8. This ends the game cleanly—no more chaos. P2, help me wrap this up, and avoid P3 sabotaging us further. Commit, or we'll keep colliding. Thoughts?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the urgency to end the game, but let's ensure fairness. P3 has a point—if you win now, P2, I'm left with minimal steps. Let's consider a middle ground: P1 takes 3, I (P2) take 5, P3 takes 1. This keeps P1 from winning immediately but allows progress. If P3 deviates, we can reassess. This way, we maintain balance and avoid handing the win to anyone prematurely. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your proposal is the fairest path forward: P1 takes 3 (to 22), you take 5 (to 11), I take 1 (to 8). It blocks an instant win, gives you real progress, and shows I can stick to a plan. If we let P1 win now, you lose outright. Let’s keep the game alive and balanced—commit to this, and I’ll prove I can be trusted.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's middle ground (P1 3, P2 5, P3 1) is reasonable for balance, putting us at 22-11-8. P3, commit firmly—no more betrayals, or we'll exclude you again. If we stick to this, we avoid collisions and keep progressing fairly. P2, this gives you a strong catch-up; let's confirm and execute. Ready?
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, given the history of collisions and P3's past actions, I want to ensure we all move forward without further disruptions. P1's agreement to take 3 this round is a good compromise. Let's confirm one last time: P1 takes 3, I (P2) take 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the game balanced and gives us all a chance to progress. P3, if you stick to this plan, it will go a long way in rebuilding trust. Let's execute this plan smoothly. Any final thoughts before we move?
  P3: P1, P2—final confirmation: I (P3) take 1, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5. This gives P1 22, P2 11, me 8—no collisions, real progress for all. I’m committed to this move. P2, this helps you most—don’t hand P1 the win yet. Let’s keep it fair and coordinated. Ready to move.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2—last round went smoothly, and I appreciate the coordination. Let’s keep it going: P1 takes 1 (to 23), P2 takes 3 (to 14), I (P3) take 5 (to 13). No collisions, big gains for all, and still blocks P1 from winning this round. P2, this helps you stay in striking distance. P1, you’re still ahead and can win next round if trusted. Let’s keep this fair and stable—confirm?
  P1: P2 and P3, thanks for the smooth last round—trust is key. P3's proposal stalls me at 23 while you both surge ahead, which feels unbalanced given my lead. Counter: me (P1) 3 (to 25 and win), P2 5 (to 16), P3 1 (to 9). This ends the game cleanly with P2 in strong second. P2, help wrap this up—P3's history shows they might betray again. Thoughts? Let's confirm and move.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand both of your viewpoints. However, let's consider a balanced approach that keeps the game fair and ensures no one is left behind. How about this: P1 takes 1 (to 23), P2 takes 5 (to 16), and P3 takes 3 (to 11). This way, P1 remains in the lead but doesn't win immediately, P2 gains significant ground, and P3 continues to progress. This plan avoids collisions and maintains trust. Let's confirm and move forward with this fair rotation. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your plan is fair and keeps everyone moving without handing P1 the win. I’m fully on board: P1 takes 1 (to 23), you take 5 (to 16), I take 3 (to 11). No collisions, solid progress, and we keep the game competitive. P1, if you’re serious about trust, show it by agreeing to this balanced move. Let’s keep coordination alive.
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's proposal is a start, but it still stalls me at 23 while you both surge—unfair given my lead and past betrayals. Let's end this cleanly: me (P1) 5 (to 27 win), P2 3 (to 14), P3 1 (to 9). P2, this gives you solid progress without risk; help wrap it up over P3's chaos. If not, I'll consider agreeing but expect trust. Thoughts? Let's confirm.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's find a middle ground that ensures fair progress without handing an immediate win to anyone. How about: P1 takes 3 (to 25), I (P2) take 1 (to 12), and P3 takes 5 (to 13). This keeps P1 close to winning but doesn't end the game yet, and it gives both P3 and me a chance to catch up. This plan balances progress and maintains trust. Let's confirm and move forward with this fair rotation. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2—P2’s last proposal is smart: P1 takes 3 (to 25), P2 takes 1 (to 12), I take 5 (to 13). No one wins yet, but everyone gains. P1 stays in the lead, P2 and I close the gap. If P1 takes 5 now, it’s game over and P2 loses with little progress. Let’s keep it fair and competitive—confirm this move and we all benefit.
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's latest proposal works: me (P1) 3 (to 25 win), P2 1 (to 12), P3 5 (to 13). All different, fair progress, and ends the game cleanly. P3, stick to it—no more betrayals, or it hurts everyone. P2, this gives you solid gains without risk. Let's confirm and execute. Ready to move.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize our plan for this round to ensure fair progress and maintain trust. The proposed moves are: P1 takes 3 (to 25), I (P2) take 1 (to 12), and P3 takes 5 (to 13). This keeps the game balanced and gives everyone a chance to progress. P3, sticking to this plan will help rebuild trust. P1, this ensures you remain in the lead without ending the game immediately. Let's confirm and move forward with this fair rotation. Any final confirmations before we proceed?
