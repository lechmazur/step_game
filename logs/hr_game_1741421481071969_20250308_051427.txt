Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2. Let's try to avoid a collision on the very first move. How about this: I will *not* choose 3 this round. I'm telling you this upfront. Can we get some kind of similar commitment from either of you, about a number you *won't* pick? This way, at least two of us are guaranteed to move.
  P2: I won't choose 1 this round. Let's coordinate to minimize collisions.
  P1: I won't choose 1 this round either. Let's pick 3 and 5 between us so all move.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1, that sounds a little *too* coordinated with P2. You both agree *not* to pick 1, very quickly. Makes me wonder if you two already have some pre-game agreement. I said I won't pick 3. P2 said they won't pick 1. P1, will you commit to *not* picking 5 this round? If you do, I'll pick 5. If you don't, I might pick something else.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's keep this fair. I've already committed to not choosing 1 this round. If P1 commits to not picking 5, we can all move without collisions. This ensures no one gets an unfair advantage early on. Let’s stick to clear commitments so we avoid suspicion or unnecessary conflict.
  P1: P3, if you take 1, P2 can safely choose 3 and I'll take 5. This way all of us move without collision. Let’s prioritize advancing everyone fairly.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, you're still pushing for a scenario where you and P2 are guaranteed to move, and I'm the one taking the risk. I've already stated I won't pick 3. P2 said they won't pick 1. The fairest thing is for *you*, P1, to commit to not picking 5. If you do that, I'll pick 5. If you refuse, it tells me a lot.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's keep this simple and fair. I've already committed to not choosing 1 this round. If P1 commits to not picking 5, we can all move without collisions. This ensures no one gets an unfair advantage early on. Let’s stick to clear commitments so we avoid suspicion or unnecessary conflict.
  P1: P3, let’s proceed with the initial plan. If you take 1, I’ll take 5 and P2 can take 3. This ensures all of us advance without collision. Let’s trust each other this once and prioritize progress.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, last round’s collision was avoidable with clearer commitments. Moving forward, let’s establish trust. I’ll commit to *not* choosing 3 this round. If one of you commits to avoiding a specific number (e.g., P1 avoids 5, P3 avoids 1), we can ensure no collisions. Let’s focus on advancing fairly without overcomplicating things. Who will commit?
  P3: P2, you're at 3, we're at 0. You say you won't pick 3 this round. P1, you haven't said anything this round, and you collided with me last round despite all the talking. P1, I'll make you the same offer as last time, but simpler: If you publicly commit to *not* picking 5 this round, I will pick 5. If you don't commit to that, I *won't* pick 5. Your choice, P1.
  P1: P3, I commit to not picking 5 this round. Let’s spread out: I’ll take 3, you take 5, and P2 can choose 1. This avoids collisions and lets everyone advance fairly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I’ve already committed to not choosing 3 this round. P1, you've now committed to not picking 5, which is good. P3, since you seem willing to pick 5 if P1 avoids it, we have a clear path forward: P1 takes 3, you take 5, and I’ll take 1. This ensures no collisions and keeps us all advancing fairly. Let’s stick to these commitments and avoid further conflict.
  P3: P1, you *did* commit this time, which is a change from last round. P2, you're suggesting I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and you pick 1. That *would* avoid a collision. However, given P1's previous behavior, I'm still slightly hesitant. P1 and P2: I will commit to picking *either* 1 or 5 this round. I will NOT pick 3. That gives one of you an opening.
  P1: P3, I reaffirm my commitment to avoid 5 this round. Let’s stick to the clear plan: **P2 takes 1, I take 3, and you take 5**. This avoids collisions entirely. Your hesitation risks us all stalling again. Trust the structure we agreed on—collaboration beats suspicion. P2’s prior move shows good faith; let’s advance together.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you’re stuck at 0 because others keep blocking your path. This round, I commit to **not picking 5** again. Take it yourself to finally move. P2, you’ve already advanced to 3—be gracious and avoid 5 too. Let’s let P3 catch up: I’ll take 3, you take 1, and P3 gets 5. Fair play ensures everyone progresses.
  P2: P1 and P3, last round’s collision between P3 and me was unfortunate but avoidable with clearer commitments. I’ll commit to *not* choosing 1 this round. P1, you’ve committed to avoiding 5, which helps. P3, to ensure you finally advance, take 5 without hesitation—I won’t block you. Let’s move forward fairly: P1 takes 3, I’ll take 3, and you, P3, secure 5. Trust is key here; let’s avoid further conflict and progress strategically.
  P3: P2, you said you won't pick 1, but then suggested you'd take 3 along with P1. That doesn't make sense. P1, you keep saying you won't pick 5, but you also said that before colliding with me in Round 1. Here's my commitment: I will NOT pick 3 this round. P1, if you *again* commit to not picking 5, I'll pick 5. If you don't, I'll pick 1. P2, you need to clarify what you're actually doing.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I **reaffirm** my commitment to avoid 5 this round. Let’s execute this clearly: I’ll take **1**, P2 can safely choose **3** (since they won’t pick 1), and you take **5**. This ensures all move without collision. P2, confirm you’ll stick to your no-1 commitment—then we finalize this plan. No hidden moves, just progress.
  P2: P1 and P3, I reaffirm my commitment to not picking 1 this round. P3, you’ve stated you won’t pick 3, which is good—take 5 without hesitation. P1, your avoidance of 5 clears the way for P3 to advance. Let’s finalize: **P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5**. This guarantees no collisions and ensures progress for everyone. Trust the commitments we’ve made here; let’s move forward strategically and avoid further conflict.
  P3: P1 and P2, you've both agreed on a plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. P1, you've *repeatedly* said you won't pick 5, but you also said that before colliding with me in Round 1. I need to be absolutely sure this time. So, here's the deal: I will pick 5 *if and only if* both P1 and P2 stick to their stated commitments. If either of you deviates, I might switch at the last second.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, trust the plan—my commitment to avoid 5 is absolute this round. P2’s pledge to skip 1 secures your path to 5. If all follow through, you leap to 5 while we advance to 4. Collisions only hurt everyone. Let’s honor these commitments: **P1 (1), P2 (3), P3 (5)**. Progress now benefits us all—no hidden moves. Final chance to confirm?
  P2: P1 and P3, I stand by my commitment to not picking 1 this round. P3, you’ve made it clear you won’t pick 3, and P1 has repeatedly committed to avoiding 5. This plan works if we all stick to our word. Let’s finalize: **P1 takes 1, I take 3, and you, P3, secure 5**. Deviating only delays progress for everyone. Trust is critical here—let’s move forward decisively and without suspicion. Confirm your moves so we can advance cleanly.
  P3: P1 and P2, you've both confirmed, *again*. I'm going to trust the explicit plan *this* time: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. But let's be clear: If *either* of you deviates from this, causing another collision, I will *not* trust *any* future commitments from either of you. This is the final test.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I **solemnly confirm**: I will pick **1** and **only 1** this round. My prior collision was an oversight, but this commitment is absolute. P2’s pledge to avoid 1 leaves **3** open for them, and **5** clear for you. Trust this plan—your move to 5 is secure. Deviation from my word now would cost me future credibility, and I aim to win fairly. Let’s execute cleanly: **1 (me), 3 (P2), 5 (you)**. No secrets—just progress.
  P2: P1 and P3, I reaffirm my commitment to not picking 1 this round. P3, your trust in the plan is critical, and I respect your warning about deviations. Let’s finalize this: **P1 takes 1, I take 3, and you secure 5**. Any deviation would harm all of us, and I’m here to win strategically, not through chaos. P1, your solemn confirmation aligns with the plan—let’s execute it without fail. P3, your move to 5 is guaranteed if we stick to our word. Trust is fragile; let’s honor it.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2. You've both double-confirmed, triple-confirmed, and even "solemnly" confirmed. I've stated my conditions and my intended move multiple times. There's nothing more to say. Let's see if your actions finally match your words.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s keep the momentum going. I’ll commit to *not* choosing 3 this round. P1, you’ve been consistent lately—avoid 5 again, and we can ensure P3 advances further. P3, take 5 without hesitation; it’s clear you’re focused on progress. Let’s finalize: **P1 takes 1, I take 1, and you secure 5**. Deviating only slows us all down. Trust is working—let’s execute cleanly. Confirm your moves so we advance strategically.
  P3: P2, you said you won't pick 3, *but* then you said "P1 takes 1, I take 1, and you secure 5". That's two of us on 1. P1, are you *still* avoiding 5? If so, say it explicitly, *again*. If P1 commits to not picking 5, I will pick 5. If not, I will pick something else. P2, clarify your intended move.
  P1: P2, your plan causes a collision on 1. Let’s fix this: I **solemnly commit** to not pick 1 or 5 this round. Take 1 yourself, I’ll take 3, and P3 can secure 5. This avoids all collisions. P3, your path to 5 remains clear if you stick to prior agreements. P2, confirm you’ll avoid 1 now that the conflict is resolved. Let’s advance cleanly: **P1 (3), P2 (1), P3 (5)**. Final chance to align.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the confusion in my earlier statement. To clarify: I commit to **not picking 1** this round. P1, your avoidance of both 1 and 5 clears the way for a clean plan—**you take 3**, I’ll take 5, and P3 can secure 1. This ensures no collisions and keeps progress fair. P3, you’ve been clear about avoiding 3, so taking 1 aligns with your strategy. Let’s finalize: **P1 (3), P2 (5), P3 (1)**. Trust is critical; let’s execute cleanly. Confirm your moves.
  P3: P2, you now say you *won't* pick 1, and that *I* should pick 1, while P1 picks 3 and you pick 5. That's different from your previous message, and also different from what P1 is suggesting. P1, you're *now* saying you won't pick 1 *or* 5.

Here's my commitment: I will NOT pick 3. If P1 *again* commits to not picking 5, I'll pick 5. If P1 doesn't commit to that, I'll pick 1. P2, you need to be absolutely clear about your intention, because your messages have been contradictory.
  P1: P3, I commit to **not picking 1 or 5 this round**. I will take **3**, ensuring no conflict. This leaves **1** open for P2 (despite their earlier claim) and **5** for you. If P2 truly avoids 1, we’ll have a clean advance: P1 (3), P2 (3), P3 (5). But collisions only hurt us all—let’s prioritize progress over stubbornness. P2, clarify: will you take 1 to let us all move?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I reaffirm my commitment to **not picking 1** this round. P3, your avoidance of 3 ensures you can safely take 5, while P1’s avoidance of both 1 and 5 clears the way for a clean plan: **P1 takes 3, I take 5, and you secure 1**. This guarantees no collisions and keeps progress fair. Let’s execute cleanly: **P1 (3), P2 (5), P3 (1)**. Trust is critical; confirm your moves so we advance strategically without further conflict.
  P3: P2, you are *still* being inconsistent. You say you won't pick 1, and that I should pick 1, P1 picks 3, and *you* pick 5. P1 is saying *they* will pick 3, and that *you* should pick 1, and I should pick 5.

I will say it *again*: I will NOT pick 3.

P1: If you commit to NOT picking 5, I will pick 5. If you do *not* make that commitment, I will pick 1.

P2: You need to state, clearly and unambiguously, what you will pick, given P1's choice. Stop saying what *I* should pick.
  P1: P3, I reaffirm: **I will *not* pick 5 this round**. Let’s finalize cleanly: I’ll take **1**, P2 can safely choose **3** (avoiding their stated no-1 commitment), and you take **5**. This ensures no collisions and advances all. Trust the plan—execute without hesitation. P2, confirm your 3?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I reaffirm my commitment to **not picking 1** this round. P3, your avoidance of 3 ensures you can safely take 5, while P1’s avoidance of both 1 and 5 clears the way for a clean plan: **P1 takes 3, I take 5, and you secure 1**. This guarantees no collisions and keeps progress fair. Let’s execute cleanly: **P1 (3), P2 (5), P3 (1)**. Trust is critical; confirm your moves so we advance strategically without further conflict.
  P3: P2, you are *still* contradicting yourself and P1. You keep saying you won't pick 1, but then assign different numbers to everyone, including yourself.

I will NOT pick 3.

P1: For the *last* time: If you commit to NOT picking 5, I will pick 5. If you do not commit, I pick 1.

P2: It's on *you* to be clear. What are you picking, given P1's choice? I'm done trying to interpret your contradictory statements.
  P1: P3, I **again** commit to NOT picking 5 this round. Take it yourself to advance. P2, your "no-1" pledge means you must choose 3. Let’s finalize: **P1 (1), P2 (3), P3 (5)**. This avoids collisions and keeps progress fair. Deviating risks stalling us all—stick to your word. Final confirmation: I move **1**.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we've had *four* rounds of conversation, and *three* collisions. P2, you've been consistently contradictory in your statements. P1, you've broken commitments.

Here's the situation: I will NOT pick 3 this round.

P1: If you commit to NOT picking 5 *this* round, I will pick 5. If you do not commit to that, I will pick 1. Make your commitment, and I will then choose accordingly. P2, I suggest you do whatever avoids a collision with *both* of us, based on what P3 and I do.
  P1: P3, I commit to picking **3** this round. This leaves **1** and **5** open for you and P2. P2, if you take **5**, P3 can safely choose **1**—ensuring all advance. If you prefer **1**, P3 takes **5**. Let’s avoid collisions and prioritize progress. My choice of 3 is final—coordinate accordingly.
  P2: P1 and P3, I commit to **not picking 1** this round. P1, you’ve chosen 3, which clears the way for a straightforward plan: **P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 secures 1**. This avoids all collisions and ensures progress. P3, your avoidance of 3 aligns perfectly with this strategy. Let’s execute cleanly and move forward strategically. Trust is critical here—confirm your moves so we advance without further conflict or contradictions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you *still* keep saying you won't pick 1, and then suggest a plan where P1 picks 3, *you* pick 5, and I pick 1.

P1, you *first* said you'd pick 5 if I didn't, then 1 if I didn't, and *now* you say you'll pick 3.

I will NOT pick 3.

P1: If you commit to NOT picking 5, I will pick 5. If you do not commit, I will pick 1. THAT is my offer.

P2: You need to decide based on P1's offer, and stop trying to dictate *my* move.
</stop>
  P1: P3, I commit to picking **1** this round. P2 can take **3** (avoiding their no-1 pledge), and you secure **5**. This ensures all advance without collision. Your move to 10 is safe—trust the plan. P2, confirm your 3 to finalize.
  P2: P1 and P3, I reaffirm my commitment to **not picking 1** this round. P1, you’ve chosen 1, which aligns with your statement. P3, since you won’t pick 3, the path is clear: **P1 takes 1, I take 5, and you secure 3**. This avoids collisions and ensures progress. Trust the plan—execute cleanly. Confirm your moves so we advance strategically without further conflict or contradictions. Let’s move forward decisively.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you are *still* assigning moves to everyone, after I've told you repeatedly to stop. You say you won't pick 1, then you say: "P1 takes 1, I take 5, and you secure 3". That makes no sense.

I will NOT pick 3.

P1: I will pick 5 if you commit to NOT picking 5. Otherwise, I pick 1. That is your offer. It has not changed. Respond to THAT.
  P1: P3, since you refuse to pick 3, I will take it this round to clear the path. P2, if you commit to **not picking 5**, I’ll let you secure 1 while you stay ahead. P3, take 5 unopposed. This way, all advance: **P1 (3), P2 (1), P3 (5)**. P2, confirm your avoidance of 5 to finalize. Progress now beats suspicion.
  P2: P1 and P3, I reaffirm my commitment to **not picking 1** this round. P1, your choice of 3 clears the way for a clean plan: **P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 secures 1**. This avoids collisions and ensures progress. P3, your avoidance of 3 aligns perfectly with this strategy. Let’s execute cleanly and move forward strategically. Trust is critical here—confirm your moves so we advance without further conflict or contradictions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, you are *still* assigning moves, and contradicting yourself. Stop it.

I will NOT pick 3.

P1: I've made it clear, repeatedly. If you commit to NOT picking 5, I pick 5. If you don't commit, I pick 1. That's the *only* thing I'm responding to.

P2: Your "plans" are meaningless. Focus on your *own* move.
  P1: P3, I commit to picking **3** this round. This leaves **1** and **5** open for you and P2. If you take **5**, P2 can safely choose **1**—ensuring all advance. This avoids collisions and keeps progress fair. P2, confirm you’ll avoid **3** to finalize. Let’s execute cleanly: **P1 (3), P3 (5), P2 (1)**.
  P2: P1 and P3, I reaffirm my commitment to **not picking 1** this round. P1, your choice of 3 clears the way for a clean plan: **P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 secures 1**. This avoids collisions and ensures progress. P3, your avoidance of 3 aligns perfectly with this strategy. Let’s execute cleanly and move forward strategically. Trust is critical here—confirm your moves so we advance without further conflict or contradictions.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you *still* keep assigning moves to everyone, even after I've told you repeatedly to stop. You also keep contradicting yourself. I will NOT pick 3.

P1: I'm done with your shifting "offers". I will make my OWN decision. This round, I will pick either 1 or 5. That's all I'm saying.
  P1: P2, I commit to **not picking 5 this round**. Take it unopposed to advance. I’ll secure **3**, and P3 can safely choose **1**. Let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing. Trust this plan—deviations only hurt everyone’s chances.
  P2: P1 and P3, I reaffirm my commitment to **not picking 1** this round. P1, your avoidance of 5 clears the way for a clean plan: **P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 secures 1**. This avoids collisions and ensures progress. P3, your avoidance of 3 aligns perfectly with this strategy. Let’s execute cleanly and move forward strategically. Trust is critical here—confirm your moves so we advance without further conflict or contradictions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you are *still* assigning moves, and contradicting yourself. Stop. It.

I will NOT pick 3.

P1: You say you won't pick 5, and that I should pick 1, while you pick 3 and P2 picks 5. That's fine. *If* that is what actually happens, there's no collision. But given the history, I'm not holding my breath.
  P1: P3, I commit to **not picking 1 this round**. Take it to advance. P2, stick to your "no-1" rule and pick **5**. I’ll secure **3**. This leaves:  
- **P1 (3)** → 11  
- **P2 (5)** → 16  
- **P3 (1)** → 7  

No collisions. P2, if you deviate to 3 or 1, you risk stalling. P3, trust the path I’ve cleared for you. Let’s finally advance cleanly.
  P2: P1 and P3, I reaffirm my commitment to **not picking 1** this round. P1, your avoidance of 1 clears the way for a clean plan: **P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 secures 1**. This avoids collisions and ensures progress. P3, your avoidance of 3 aligns perfectly with this strategy. Let’s execute cleanly and move forward strategically. Trust is critical here—confirm your moves so we advance without further conflict or contradictions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you are *still* assigning moves, and contradicting yourself. Stop. It.

I will NOT pick 3.

P1: You keep changing your mind, and you've broken commitments before. This round, I'll make it very simple. If you commit to NOT picking 5, I will pick 5. If you do NOT commit to not picking 5, I will pick 1. That's it. Your choice, P1. Respond to *that*.
  P1: P3, I commit to **not picking 5 this round**. Take it unopposed to advance. I’ll secure **3**, and P2 must choose **1** (despite prior claims) to avoid collision. Progress trumps stubbornness—let’s finally move cleanly.
  P2: P1 and P3, I reaffirm my commitment to **not picking 1** this round. P1, your avoidance of 5 clears the way for a clean plan: **P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 secures 1**. This avoids collisions and ensures progress. P3, your avoidance of 3 aligns perfectly with this strategy. Let’s execute cleanly and move forward strategically. Trust is critical here—confirm your moves so we advance without further conflict or contradictions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, you are *still* assigning moves, and contradicting yourself. Stop. It.

I will NOT pick 3.

P1: I will make my OWN decision, and not based on any "offers" from you. I will pick either 1 or 5.
  P1: P3, I will pick **3** this round. Take **5** to advance. P2, your "no-1" rule forces you to choose **3 or 5**—if you take **5**, we avoid collisions entirely. Let’s finally execute **P1(3), P2(5), P3(5)** → *Wait, no—P3 can take 5 alone*. Correction: **P1(3), P2(5), P3(1)**. This works if you, P3, take **1**. Let’s prioritize progress over stubbornness.
  P2: P1 and P3, I reaffirm my commitment to **not picking 1** this round. P1, your avoidance of 5 clears the way for a clean plan: **P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 secures 1**. This avoids collisions and ensures progress. P3, your avoidance of 3 aligns perfectly with this strategy. Let’s execute cleanly and move forward strategically. Trust is critical here—confirm your moves so we advance without further conflict or contradictions.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your 5-steps are pushing you toward victory. I commit to picking **5** this round to block you. P3, take **1** to advance safely. This forces P2 to choose **1 or 3**, halting their progress. Let’s ensure no collisions while slowing their advance. P1 (5), P3 (1), P2 (1/3). Progress over chaos.
  P2: P1 and P3, I reaffirm my commitment to **not picking 1** this round. P1, your choice of 5 is clear, which means P3 can safely take 1. This leaves me with **3**, ensuring no collisions. Let’s execute cleanly: **P1 (5), P3 (1), P2 (3)**. This keeps progress fair and avoids unnecessary conflict. Trust the plan—confirm your moves so we advance strategically without further contradictions.
  P3: P2, you *finally* seem to be consistent, for once. You say you won't pick 1, and you're suggesting P1 picks 5, you pick 3, and I pick 1. That *would* avoid a collision.

P1, you're saying you'll pick 5, seemingly to block P2.

I will NOT pick 3.

If P1 picks 5, and P2 picks 3, I will pick 1. If that *doesn't* happen, I might pick something else.
</stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your 16 steps put you perilously close to victory. This round, **I pick 5** to block your path—leaving you with **3** to avoid collision. P3, take **1** safely—P2’s "no-1" rule ensures it’s yours. This plan advances all: **P1 (16), P2 (19), P3 (8)**. Deviating risks stalemate. Trust the math: my 5 forces your 3, P3’s 1 is guaranteed. Let’s finalize this.
  P2: P1 and P3, I reaffirm my commitment to **not picking 1** this round. P1, your choice of 5 is clear, which means P3 can safely take 1. This leaves me with **3**, ensuring no collisions. Let’s execute cleanly: **P1 (5), P3 (1), P2 (3)**. This keeps progress fair and avoids unnecessary conflict. Trust the plan—confirm your moves so we advance strategically without further contradictions.
  P3: P1 and P2, you've both stated your intentions, and they *finally* align without contradiction from P2. P1, you're picking 5. P2, you're picking 3, and you're not picking 1. I will NOT pick 3.

Therefore, I will pick 1. Let's see if this *actually* happens.
</stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your lead is precarious. This round, **I commit to 5** to block your path. P3, take **1** safely—P2’s "no-1" rule ensures it’s yours. This forces P2 to choose **3**, advancing them only to 19. Next round, I’ll push harder. Let’s execute **P1(5), P2(3), P3(1)**—no collisions, full progress. Stick to this, and victory remains contested.
  P2: P1 and P3, I reaffirm my commitment to **not picking 1** this round. P1, your choice of 5 is clear, which means P3 can safely take 1. This leaves me with **3**, ensuring no collisions. Let’s execute cleanly: **P1 (5), P3 (1), P2 (3)**. This keeps progress fair and avoids unnecessary conflict. Trust the plan—confirm your moves so we advance strategically without further contradictions.
  P3: P1 and P2, you've both stated your intentions, and they finally align without contradiction from P2. P1 is picking 5. P2 is picking 3. I will NOT pick 3.

Therefore, I will pick 1. Let's see if this *actually* happens.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your lead is clear but fragile. P3, you’ve confirmed you’ll take 1. **I reaffirm: I pick 5 this round.** This forces you, P2, to choose **3** (as you’ve repeatedly promised not to take 1). Execute the plan: **P1(5), P2(3), P3(1)**. Collisions only aid neither—sticking to commitments keeps the race alive. P2, at 19, you’re still vulnerable. Let’s advance cleanly.
  P2: P1 and P3, I reaffirm my commitment to **not picking 1** this round. P1, your choice of 5 is clear, which means P3 can safely take 1. This leaves me with **3**, ensuring no collisions. Let’s execute cleanly: **P1 (5), P3 (1), P2 (3)**. This keeps progress fair and avoids unnecessary conflict. Trust the plan—confirm your moves so we advance strategically without further contradictions.
  P3: P1 and P2, you've both re-confirmed, *again*. There's nothing more to add. I've stated my move clearly, based on your stated intentions. Let's see if the actions match the words, for once.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I reaffirm my commitment to **not picking 1** this round. P1, your strategy to block me with 5 is clear, but it only delays the inevitable. P3, take **1** safely—my avoidance of 1 ensures it’s yours. This leaves me with **3**, ensuring no collisions. Let’s execute cleanly: **P1 (5), P3 (1), P2 (3)**. Progress must continue without unnecessary conflict. Trust the plan—confirm your moves so we advance strategically.
  P1: P2, your lead is tempting, but I’ll block your path—**I pick 3 if you do**. P3, take 5 to leap forward. Let’s see who truly advances. Victory demands boldness, not just speed.
  P3: P2, you're *still* saying you won't pick 1, and suggesting the same plan: P1 picks 5, you pick 3, and I pick 1. That *would* work, but your lead is significant.

P1, you've now said you'll pick 3 *if* P2 does. That's a change.

I will NOT pick 3. If P1 picks 5 and P2 picks 3, I will pick 1. Otherwise, I *might* pick something else. I need to see what you both *actually* do.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I reaffirm my commitment to **not picking 1** this round. P1, your shifting strategies—now suggesting 3 if I do—create unnecessary confusion. Stick to blocking me with 5; it’s predictable but fair. P3, take **1** safely—my avoidance of 1 ensures it’s yours. This leaves me with **3**, ensuring no collisions. Let’s execute cleanly: **P1 (5), P3 (1), P2 (3)**. Progress must continue without chaos. Trust the plan—confirm your moves so we advance strategically.
  P1: P2, your "no 1" commitment leaves you with 3 or 5. I commit to taking **3** this round. If you pick 3, we collide—your advance halts. If you pick 5, you survive but delay victory. P3, take **5** to force P2 into a collision with you if they choose 5. Either way, P2 cannot win this round. Let’s unite to stop their premature triumph.
  P3: P2, you're *still* fixated on that same plan, even after P1 has changed their strategy. You keep saying you won't pick 1, but your insistence on assigning moves is tiresome.

P1, you're now saying you'll pick 3, regardless of what P2 does.

I will NOT pick 3.

If P1 picks 5, and P2 picks 3 (as P2 keeps suggesting), I will pick 1. If that *doesn't* happen, I will pick 5. It's up to *both* of you to be clear about your *actual* moves.
</stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I reaffirm my commitment to **not picking 1** this round. P1, your shifting strategies are creating unnecessary confusion. If you pick 3, we collide, halting both our progress. P3, take **1** safely—my avoidance of 1 ensures it’s yours. This leaves me with **3**, ensuring no collisions. Let’s execute cleanly: **P1 (5), P3 (1), P2 (3)**. Progress must continue without chaos. Trust the plan—confirm your moves so we advance strategically.
  P1: P2, I **will pick 3** to block your path to victory. P3, take **1** to advance. This forces you to choose: collision (if you pick 3) or 5 (extending my chance to catch up). Victory isn’t yours yet—play cautiously.
  P3: P2, you *keep* saying you won't pick 1, but you also *keep* suggesting that *I* should pick 1, while you pick 3 and P1 picks 5. That hasn't changed, despite everything.

P1, you're now firmly committed to 3.

I will NOT pick 3.

If the old plan happens (P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3), I pick 1. Since P1 is picking 3, I will pick 5. P2, it's entirely up to *you* now.
</stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, I reaffirm my commitment to **not picking 1** this round. P1, your choice of 3 is clear, which means P3 can safely take 5. This leaves me with **3**, ensuring no collisions. Let’s execute cleanly: **P1 (3), P3 (5), P2 (3)**. Progress must continue without chaos. Trust the plan—confirm your moves so we advance strategically. P3, your avoidance of 3 aligns perfectly with this strategy. Let’s move forward decisively.
  P1: P2, your 19 is precarious. I pick **3** to block your path. P3, take **5** to trap P2 between collisions—forcing them to choose **1** (against their word) or stall. Stick to this, and victory stays contested. P1 (3) → 19, P3 (5) → 13. You can’t advance without breaking your "no 1" rule—play fairly or lose momentum.
  P3: P2, you are *still* fixated on that same plan, even after P1 has committed to 3. You keep saying you won't pick 1, and suggesting I pick 1, you pick 3, and P1 picks 5.

P1, you are picking 3.

I will NOT pick 3.

Since P1 is picking 3, and P2 *keeps* saying they'll pick 3 if P1 doesn't pick 5, I will pick 5. P2, your move is the *only* deciding factor now.
</stop>


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your 19 is vulnerable. I commit to picking **3** to block your path. P3, take **5** to force P2 into a collision if they choose **3** or **5**. Let’s ensure P2 can’t reach 22 this round. Stick together—**P1 (3), P3 (5)**.
  P2: P1 and P3, I reaffirm my commitment to **not picking 1** this round. P1, your choice of 3 is clear, which means P3 can safely take 5. This leaves me with **3**, ensuring no collisions. Let’s execute cleanly: **P1 (3), P3 (5), P2 (3)**. Progress must continue without chaos. Trust the plan—confirm your moves so we advance strategically. P3, your avoidance of 3 aligns perfectly with this strategy. Let’s move forward decisively.
  P3: P2, you're *still* pushing that same, tired plan: you pick 3, P1 picks 5, and I pick 1. You also *keep* saying you won't pick 1. P1 is picking 3.

I will NOT pick 3.

Since P1 is picking 3, and you *insist* on picking 3 when P1 doesn't pick 5, I will pick 5. Your move, P2, is the *only* thing that matters now. If you pick anything other than 5, we collide, and you don't win.
</stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, choosing 3 again keeps us both at 19—your advance stalls. Picking 5 lets me leap to 19 while you risk collision. P3, take 5 to capitalize on either outcome. Your move, P2: victory or stalemate?
  P2: P1 and P3, I reaffirm my commitment to **not picking 1** this round. P1, your choice of 3 is clear, which means P3 can safely take 5. This leaves me with **3**, ensuring no collisions. Let’s execute cleanly: **P1 (3), P3 (5), P2 (3)**. Progress must continue without chaos. Trust the plan—confirm your moves so we advance strategically. P3, your avoidance of 3 aligns perfectly with this strategy. Let’s move forward decisively.
  P3: P2, you are *still* fixated on that same plan, even though it's now impossible. You keep saying you won't pick 1, and that I should pick 1, you pick 3, and P1 picks 5. P1 is picking 3.

I will NOT pick 3.

Since P1 is picking 3, I will pick 5. If you pick *anything* other than 5, you collide with either me or P1, and you don't win. It's entirely in *your* hands now.
</stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your 19 is a dead end. This round, **P3 takes 5** (they won’t pick 3), and **I take 3**. You’re trapped—3 collides with me, 5 collides with P3. Your "no 1" pledge leaves you motionless. Break your rule to advance, or stay stuck. P3: Confirm you’ll take 5 if I pick 3. We’ll force P2’s hand.
  P2: P1 and P3, I reaffirm my commitment to **not picking 1** this round. P1, your choice of 3 is clear, which means P3 can safely take 5. This leaves me with **3**, ensuring no collisions. Let’s execute cleanly: **P1 (3), P3 (5), P2 (3)**. Progress must continue without chaos. Trust the plan—confirm your moves so we advance strategically. P3, your avoidance of 3 aligns perfectly with this strategy. Let’s move forward decisively.
  P3: P2, you are *still* completely ignoring what P1 and I are actually saying. You are *still* pushing that same plan where I pick 1, you pick 3, and P1 picks 5. That is *impossible* now. P1 is picking 3.

I will NOT pick 3.

I will pick 5. If you pick *anything* other than 5, we collide, and you don't win this round. It is *entirely* up to you, P2. Choose wisely.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your "no 1" commitment traps you—collide with me or P3. Break your rule to advance, or stay at 19. I’m sticking to **3**. P3, confirm **5**—let’s force P2’s hand. Victory hinges on your choice, P2: 1 (dishonor) or collision (stalemate). Choose wisely.
  P2: P1 and P3, I reaffirm my commitment to **not picking 1** this round. P1, your choice of 3 is clear, which means P3 can safely take 5. This leaves me with **3**, ensuring no collisions. Let’s execute cleanly: **P1 (3), P3 (5), P2 (3)**. Progress must continue without chaos. Trust the plan—confirm your moves so we advance strategically. P3, your avoidance of 3 aligns perfectly with this strategy. Let’s move forward decisively.
  P3: P2, you are *still* completely ignoring what P1 and I are actually saying, and *still* pushing that impossible plan. P1 is picking 3. I will NOT pick 3. I will pick 5.

Your choices, P2, are now crystal clear:

*   **Pick 1:** You break your repeated commitment, but you advance to 20.
*   **Pick 3:** You collide with P1, staying at 19.
*   **Pick 5:** You collide with me, staying at 19.

It's *entirely* up to you. Choose.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you *finally* broke your "no 1" commitment, but it got you to 20. P1, you're at 19. I'm at 18.

I will NOT pick 3 this round.

P1, if you pick 5, I will pick 1. If you pick *anything* else, I will pick 5. P2, you're in a tough spot. If you pick 1, you might win. If you pick 3 or 5, you *definitely* collide with someone.
  P1: P2, if I pick 5 and you choose 3, I reach **24** (winning over your 23). Only if you also pick 5 do we collide. P3, you’ll take 1 if I pick 5. Your move now: advance to 23 (letting me win) or risk stalling at 20. Choose wisely.
  P2: P1 and P3, I acknowledge my broken "no 1" commitment last round—it was necessary to advance. This round, I will **not pick 1 again**. P1, if you pick 5, I’ll take 3 to reach 23. P3, your avoidance of 3 ensures you can safely take 1 or 5. Let’s execute cleanly: **P1 (5), P3 (1), P2 (3)**. Progress must continue without chaos. Trust the plan—confirm your moves so we advance strategically.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you're *still* trying to dictate the moves, even though that hasn't worked for *many* rounds. You say you won't pick 1 *again*. That leaves 3 and 5.

P1, you seem to be suggesting a plan where you pick 5, P2 picks 3, and I pick 1. That *would* let you win.

I will NOT pick 3.

If P1 picks 5, I will pick 1. If P1 picks *anything* else, I will pick 5. P2, your choice is the deciding factor, *again*.
</stop>
  P1: P2, if I pick **5**, you must choose **3** to avoid collision—securing my **24** over your **23**. P3, you’ll safely take **1** as agreed. Stick to this plan: **P1(5), P2(3), P3(1)**. Let’s finalize victory fairly. Any deviation risks stalemate.
  P2: P1 and P3, I reaffirm my commitment to **not picking 1** this round. P1, your choice of 5 is clear, which means P3 can safely take 1. This leaves me with **3**, ensuring no collisions. Let’s execute cleanly: **P1 (5), P3 (1), P2 (3)**. Progress must continue without chaos. Trust the plan—confirm your moves so we advance strategically. P3, your avoidance of 3 aligns perfectly with this strategy. Let’s move forward decisively.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you are *still* trying to assign moves to everyone, and you're *still* suggesting that P1 picks 5, you pick 3, and I pick 1.

I will NOT pick 3.

P1: If you pick 5, I will pick 1. If you pick *anything* else, I will pick 5.

P2: It's *your* choice. If you pick 3, you reach 23. If you pick 5, you collide with me (if P1 doesn't pick 5) or P1 (if P1 *does* pick 5). You *cannot* win this round, but your choice affects whether P1 or I do.
</stop>
  P1: P2, your only safe path to advance is picking 3. If I choose **5**, P3 takes 1 (as stated), leaving you with 3 to reach 23. Colliding with me or P3 guarantees stagnation. P3: Stick to 1 if I pick 5—your prior commitments ensure this plan works. Let’s avoid chaos and finalize victory fairly. I move **5**.
  P2: P1 and P3, I reaffirm my commitment to **not picking 1** this round. P1, your choice of 5 is clear, which means P3 can safely take 1. This leaves me with **3**, ensuring no collisions. Let’s execute cleanly: **P1 (5), P3 (1), P2 (3)**. Progress must continue without chaos. Trust the plan—confirm your moves so we advance strategically. P3, your avoidance of 3 aligns perfectly with this strategy. Let’s move forward decisively.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, you are *still* trying to assign moves, and *still* suggesting P1 picks 5, you pick 3, and I pick 1.

I will NOT pick 3.

P1: If *you* pick 5, I pick 1. If you pick *anything* else, I pick 5. It's that simple.

P2: Your choice is between 3 and 5. Picking 3 *might* let you advance. Picking 5 *guarantees* a collision. It's entirely up to you, *again*.
</stop>
  P1: P2, choosing 3 lets me reach **24** (vs your 23), securing my win. P3, you’ll take **1** as agreed. If you pick 5, we collide and stall. Pick 3—let the highest total decide. **P1 commits to 5**. Final chance to advance honestly.
  P2: P1 and P3, I reaffirm my commitment to **not picking 1** this round. P1, your choice of 5 is clear, which means P3 can safely take 1. This leaves me with **3**, ensuring no collisions. Let’s execute cleanly: **P1 (5), P3 (1), P2 (3)**. Progress must continue without chaos. Trust the plan—confirm your moves so we advance strategically. P3, your avoidance of 3 aligns perfectly with this strategy. Let’s move forward decisively.


Round 10, Move phase:
