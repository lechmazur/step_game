Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi P1 and P3, I'm leaning toward a moderate approach this round. If we all rush for a big leap, collisions might hold us back. I suggest we try to avoid picking the obvious move to keep our paths clear—diversity could be key. I won’t reveal my plan, but sometimes a steady pace wins the race. Good luck to both!
  P3: P2 makes a good point about avoiding collisions. I'm willing to coordinate to some extent. How about we each pick a different number this round? P1, are you willing to commit to a specific number if I commit to a different one?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I agree that avoiding collisions is crucial early on. I'm open to coordinating this round to ensure we all advance. P3, I'm willing to commit to a number if we can agree on a split. How about I take the smallest move this time? Let me know if that works for you both, or if you have a different suggestion. Let's keep the momentum going without stepping on each other's toes.

  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Round 1 really showed the impact of our moves. I'm rethinking my pace this turn and might lean toward a bolder move—without committing yet. I'm curious if either of you plan to stick with the pattern from last round or shake things up. A little unpredictability could force a collision, and that’s one dynamic we might exploit. What’s your general direction this turn?
  P3: P2, I think "a bolder move" is a bad idea. We both picked 3 last round, so if you pick 5 this round, you're likely to collide with P1, who only moved 1 last round. I'm inclined to pick 1 this round to avoid a collision. P1, does that sound good to you?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate the discussion on avoiding collisions. P3, I'm fine with you taking 1 this round, and I’m considering a different number to keep us all moving forward. P2, a bolder move could work if we coordinate, but let’s not overlap. I’m leaning toward a middle ground myself. Can we agree to spread out our choices again this round? Let me know your thoughts.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's keep this coordination going. P2, you went big last round. I'm still behind, so I'm thinking of going for 5 this round to catch up a bit. P1, can you pick either 1 or 3 to avoid a collision? Let me know what you think.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’ve been able to coordinate so far. P3, I’m okay with you taking 5 this round to catch up. I’ll pick a different number to avoid any collision—leaning toward 1 or 3. P2, since you went big last round, maybe you can take a smaller step this time to balance things out? Let’s keep spreading our choices to ensure we all advance. What do you think?
  P2: I appreciate the insights, P1 and P3. Noticing P3’s leaning towards 5 and P1’s consideration of 1 or 3, I’ll keep my plan flexible and aim for a distinct choice to avoid any collision. I want to protect my lead and ensure we all progress without unnecessary setbacks. Good luck to both!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, since you're being so flexible, how about you pick 3 this round? That would leave 1 for P1 and 5 for me, and we'd all advance. Does that sound good?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m on board with P3’s suggestion to split our choices. P2, if you’re okay with taking 3, I’ll go for 1 this round to ensure we all advance without colliding. P3, that leaves 5 for you to catch up. Let’s stick to this plan to keep the momentum going for everyone. Does this work for both of you?
  P2: I appreciate the coordination so far. I support the idea of choosing distinct moves, but given my current lead, I’m inclined to play it safe and adjust if any changes occur. If you’re both firmly set on your choices, I’ll stick with a non-colliding option to keep my advantage. Let’s confirm that we’re all committed to different numbers this round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, we've been doing a good job coordinating so far. P2 has a slight lead, so I think it's still in our best interests to keep avoiding collisions. P1, are you still willing to take the smallest number? P2, are you willing to pick either 3 or 5 based on what P1 picks? Let's keep the momentum going.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still committed to avoiding collisions to keep us all progressing. P3, I’m willing to take the smallest number again this round if that helps us coordinate. P2, since you’re in the lead, maybe you can take 3 or 5 based on what works best for the split? I think sticking to distinct choices is our best strategy for now. Let me know if this sounds good or if you have other ideas to ensure we all advance.
  P2: I'll stick with 3 this round. If P1 goes with 1 and P3 takes 5 as we discussed, our moves stay distinct and we all advance safely. This coordination helps maintain my lead while ensuring smooth progress. Let’s lock it in.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, it sounds like we have a plan. P1 is taking 1, P2 is taking 3, and I'll take 5. Let's lock it in and hope for the best!
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligning on a plan. I’ll stick with 1 this round as discussed to keep our moves distinct. P2, thanks for confirming 3, and P3, 5 seems good for you to catch up. Let’s finalize this split to ensure we all advance without any collisions. I think this coordination benefits us for now. Does everyone agree to lock in these choices? If so, I’m ready to move forward.
  P2: I'm glad our plan is shaping up. I'm set for a safe, moderate move for now but will adjust if any of you change your minds—just give me a heads-up. Our clear, distinct choices have boosted our progress, and I want to keep that advantage. Let’s quickly confirm our unique moves so we can lock in and move confidently.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, last round showed we can’t always trust stated plans, as collisions still happened. I’m disappointed, but let’s refocus on avoiding overlaps. I’m willing to stick with a smaller move again to ensure progress. P3, since we’re tied, maybe you take a middle or higher number? P2, with your lead, can you pick something distinct from us? Let’s be clear and commit to different choices this round to guarantee advancement. What are your thoughts on a new split to prevent another setback?
  P2: I agree—last round’s collision hurt us all. I’m leaning toward a moderate, distinct move to safeguard my lead. If P1 commits to a smaller step and P3 opts for a larger one, we can all progress without overlap. Let’s clearly split our roles this turn to avoid setbacks. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, last round was a mess. P2 still has a lead. I'm thinking we should try to knock P2 out this round. P1, are you willing to coordinate with me to both pick 5? If we both pick 5, P2 will likely pick 1 or 3 to try to advance, and we can block each other. This gives us a chance to catch up. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m open to rethinking our approach after last round’s collision. P3, I understand your idea to target P2, but blocking might risk our own progress if we misjudge. I’d prefer a safer split to ensure at least some of us advance. I’ll commit to 1 again to minimize overlap. P3, if you take 3, and P2 goes for 5, we could all move forward. P2, does that work for you? Let’s prioritize distinct choices this round to avoid another setback. What do you both think?
  P2: I appreciate the push for a safe, distinct split. I’m locking in 5 this turn to protect my lead. P1, if you stick with 1 as you mentioned, and P3 opts for 3 instead of targeting my move, we all move forward without collision. Trying to block me risks colliding and hindering your own progress. Let’s commit to clear, non-overlapping moves so we can all advance steadily.
  P3: P1 and P2, P2 is clearly not trustworthy, claiming to want distinct moves but then picking 5 when we planned on 3 and 5 last round. P1, I still think targeting P2 is the best strategy. If you're not comfortable with 5, would you be willing to pick 3 this round? I'll pick 5, and if P2 picks 1, at least one of us will advance.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still focused on avoiding collisions to ensure progress. P3, I get your concern about P2’s reliability, but targeting risks us both stalling. I’ll stick with 1 this round to guarantee a safe move. P3, if you take 3 and P2 takes 5 as suggested, we all advance. P2, can you confirm you’re set on 5? Let’s prioritize a clear split over blocking to maximize our chances. I’m ready to lock in 1 if we agree on distinct choices. What’s your final stance?
  P2: I appreciate all your points. However, targeting or blocking risks stalling everyone. I'm firmly sticking with my move—5—for the sake of my lead and steady progress. Collisions only hurt our chances of advancing, so I urge you both to avoid self-defeating strategies. Let’s each focus on our own safe moves rather than trying to block one another. I'll follow through with 5.
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear we can't trust each other completely. P2 is sticking with 5. P1 is taking 1. I'm going to pick 3 this round. This gives me the best chance to move forward, and hopefully, we won't collide. Good luck to both of you.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with 1 this round to ensure a safe move and avoid any overlap. P3, I’m glad you’re going for 3, and P2, if you’re set on 5, we should all advance without collision. Let’s finalize this split to prevent another setback. I’m committed to 1 and hope we can all progress this turn. Does this work for everyone? If so, I’m ready to lock in.
  P2: I appreciate everyone’s input. I still believe that sticking to distinct moves is our best route to steady progress—collisions only hold us all back. Let’s finalize our unique choices and avoid any second-guessing now. I’m committed to my plan and ready to lock it in if everyone’s on board.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, it seems we're all set on our moves for this round: P1 with 1, P2 with 5, and me with 3. Let's hope this split works out and we all advance. Good luck, and let's see where we stand after this round.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm building on my lead with a secure, moderate move this round. To avoid costly collisions, I suggest we each choose a distinct number. I'm committed to a safe option that keeps me in the game—let’s aim for unique selections so we all advance steadily. What are your thoughts?
  P3: P2 has a significant lead. P1 is behind me. I think we should both pick 5 this round to try and block P2. P1, are you willing to pick 5 with me? Even if we don't block P2, it will allow me to catch up to you. Let me know what you think.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m focused on advancing steadily. P3, I understand your idea to block P2 with 5, but I’m worried it risks us both stalling. I’d prefer a safe split to ensure progress. I’ll commit to 1 again to avoid overlap. P3, if you take 3, and P2 picks 5, we can all move forward. P2, does that work for you? Let’s prioritize distinct choices to maximize advancement. I’m ready to lock in 1 if we agree on a split. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand the urge to try a blocking tactic, but that risks collisions and stalling us all. I remain focused on steady progress and believe distinct, non-overlapping moves are our best strategy. I appreciate P1’s safe approach and urge P3 to choose a move that avoids overlap. Let’s stick to coordinated, conflict-free steps this round to maximize our advancement.
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear we have different strategies. P2 wants to maintain the lead, P1 wants to avoid collisions, and I need to catch up. Since P1 is committed to 1, and P2 is likely to pick 5 again, I'm going to pick 3. This gives me the best chance to advance. Good luck to you both.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking to my plan of taking 1 this round to ensure a safe move and avoid any collision. P3, I see you’re leaning toward 3, which works well. P2, if you’re set on 5, we can all advance without overlap. Let’s confirm this split to guarantee progress for everyone. I’m committed to 1 and ready to lock in if we’re all aligned on distinct choices. Does this plan still work for both of you? Let’s avoid any last-minute changes to keep the momentum going.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm my move: I'm locking in 5 this round. With P1 at 1 and P3 at 3, our moves remain distinct and collision-free. Let's stick to these choices with no last-minute changes so we all advance safely.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, it seems we're set on P1 with 1, me with 3, and P2 with 5. Let's lock in these moves for this round. Hopefully, we can all advance without any collisions this time. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligning on distinct moves with me at 1, P3 at 3, and P2 at 5. This split should ensure we all advance without collisions. Let’s stick to these choices and avoid any last-minute switches to maintain our momentum. I’m fully committed to 1 and ready to lock in. Can we all confirm once more to finalize this plan? I believe this coordination benefits us all at this stage. Good luck, and let’s keep progressing!


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: All right, everyone—I’m confirming our split. I’m committed to the plan we agreed on and won’t change my strategy. Let's stick to our distinct moves without any last-minute surprises so we all move forward steadily.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, it seems we're all set on our moves for this round: P1 with 1, me with 3, and P2 with 5. Let's lock in these moves for this round. Hopefully, we can all advance without any collisions this time. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’ve settled on distinct moves with me at 1, P3 at 3, and P2 at 5. This split should guarantee we all advance without any collisions. I’m fully committed to 1 and ready to lock in. Let’s avoid any last-minute changes to ensure our progress. I believe sticking to this plan benefits us all right now. Good luck, and let’s keep moving forward!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that coordinating isn't working. P2 is too far ahead. P1, I propose we both pick 1 this round to block P2, who will likely pick 1 or 3. It's our only chance to slow P2 down. What do you think, P1?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m frustrated with the recent collisions and want to ensure progress. P3, I see your point about slowing P2, but blocking with 1 risks us stalling while P2 might pick higher. I’ll stick to 1 for safety, but I’m open to a different split. P3, maybe take 3, and P2, can you confirm 5 to avoid overlap? Let’s prioritize distinct moves to guarantee advancement for at least some of us. I’m committed to avoiding setbacks. What do you both think about this split?
  P2: I understand your concerns, but blocking only slows us all down—even if it targets my lead, it risks stalling progress. I favor distinct, non-overlapping moves so everyone can advance steadily. I’m committed to a collision-free approach and will choose my move accordingly. Let's stick to a clear split that avoids overlaps instead of targeting each other.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're not making progress with this "distinct moves" strategy. P2 is still in the lead. P1, you're sticking with 1. P2, are you going to pick 5 again? If so, I'm going to pick 3. If P2 picks something else, I'll adjust. But we need to do something to close the gap with P2.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still focused on avoiding collisions to ensure progress. P3, I understand the urge to close the gap with P2, but blocking risks us stalling. I’m sticking with 1 for safety. P3, if you take 3, and P2 goes for 5, we can all advance. P2, can you confirm your choice to help us split moves? Let’s commit to distinct numbers this round to maximize advancement. I’m ready to lock in 1 if we agree on this plan. What’s your stance on this split?
  P2: P2: I'm sticking with my plan—I'll choose 5. Blocking strategies might slow all of us down, including me, so I favor a clear split. With P1 at 1 and P3 at 3, we avoid collisions and advance steadily. Let's commit to these distinct moves this round for our mutual progress.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems we're at an impasse. Sticking to distinct moves hasn't closed the gap with P2. P1 is at 1, P2 is at 5. I'm going to pick 3. Let's see if this helps me make some progress. Good luck to you both.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m committed to avoiding collisions and ensuring progress. I’m sticking with 1 this round for safety. P3, I see you’re going for 3, which works well. P2, since you’ve confirmed 5, let’s lock in this split to guarantee we all advance. I think sticking to distinct moves is our best shot right now to keep moving forward. I’m ready to finalize my choice if we’re all aligned. Can we confirm this plan once more to avoid any surprises? Good luck, and let’s make this round count!
  P2: I'm confirming my move: I'll stick with 5. With P1 at 1 and P3 at 3, our distinct choices should avoid collisions and keep us advancing steadily. Let's honor our commitments without last-minute changes so we all make progress. I'm set on 5 and trust our plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're clearly not coordinating effectively. P2 is maintaining a significant lead, and sticking to distinct moves isn't helping me catch up. P1 is consistently picking 1, and P2 is set on 5. I'm going to pick 3 again this round in the hopes of making some progress. Good luck to you both.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still set on 1 to ensure a safe move and avoid overlap. P3, I get your frustration with the gap, but distinct moves give us the best chance to advance. P2, thanks for confirming 5. P3, sticking with 3 works for this split. Let’s lock in these choices without any last-minute changes to guarantee progress for all of us. I’m fully committed to 1 and ready to finalize. Can we agree to stick to this plan? Good luck, and let’s keep pushing forward!
  P2: Blocking only delays progress for everyone. I’m sticking with the steady, collision-free approach that built my lead. Risky block tactics could backfire and stall us all, so I urge both of you to commit to distinct, safe moves this round. Let’s finalize our choices and keep advancing rather than wasting time on last‐minute changes.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still focused on avoiding collisions to keep progressing. P2, you’ve got a strong lead at 18, so I hope we can split moves again. I’ll stick with 1 for safety. P3, maybe take 3 to advance, and P2, can you confirm 5 to avoid overlap? Let’s commit to distinct choices this round to ensure we all move forward. I’m ready to lock in 1 if we agree on this plan. What do you both think about this split to maximize our advancement? Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, P2 is one move away from winning. We need to stop P2 this round. P1, I know you've been picking 1, but we need to block P2. P2, what are you going to pick? If you pick 3 or 5, P1 and I will both pick that number to block you. If you pick 1, P1 will pick 3, and I'll pick 5.
  P2: I'll stick with 5. Block tactics only stall progress, and I’m focused on steadily extending my lead. P1’s safe 1 works well, and while I understand P3’s intent, trying to block me only hurts all of us. I remain committed to 5 and trust that steady, non-colliding moves eventually win the game.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still committed to avoiding collisions. P2, with your lead at 18, I understand P3’s urgency to block, but I think a split is safer. I’m sticking with 1 for progress. P3, I suggest you take 3, and P2, since you’ve confirmed 5, let’s lock this in to ensure we all advance. Blocking risks stalling us both. I’m ready to finalize 1 if we agree on distinct moves. Can we confirm this plan to maximize advancement? Good luck, and let’s keep moving forward!
  P3: P1 and P2, P2 is one move away from winning. P1 is still picking 1. P2 says they're picking 5. I'm going to pick 3. P1, if you're really set on 1, then I will pick 3. If P2 is telling the truth, then I will move forward. If P2 is lying, then I will at least not be blocked.
  P2: I'm staying committed to a steady approach. We all know that block tactics lead to collisions that set everyone back. I urge you both to stick to distinct moves without last-minute changes. Consistent, individual progress is our best chance to keep advancing. I'll follow through on my private decision. Let's trust our plans and avoid overlaps so that we each move forward. Good luck to both!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still set on 1 to ensure progress without overlap. P2, with your lead, sticking to 5 as you’ve said works for me. P3, I see you’re on 3, which fits our split. Let’s avoid blocking tactics that could stall us and commit to these distinct moves to guarantee advancement. I’m locked in on 1 and urge no last-minute changes. Can we finalize this plan to keep moving forward? Good luck, and let’s make this round count!
  P3: P1 and P2, P2 is one move away from winning. P1 is still picking 1. P2 says they're picking 5. I'm going to pick 3. P1, if you're really set on 1, then I will pick 3. If P2 is telling the truth, then I will move forward. If P2 is lying, then I will at least not be blocked.
  P2: I'll stick with 5, as promised. Blocking only delays everyone. With P1 at 1 and P3 at 3, our moves remain distinct. I’m locked in on 5—no last-minute changes. Trusting our respective commitments ensures steady progress for all of us. Let's finalize this plan and move forward.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with 1 to ensure my progress without overlap. P2, since you’re set on 5, and P3, with you on 3, we have a clear split. Let’s avoid any blocking or last-minute changes that could cause collisions and stall us. I’m fully committed to 1 and ready to lock in. Can we all confirm this plan one last time to guarantee advancement? Sticking to distinct moves benefits us now. Good luck, and let’s keep pushing forward this round!
  P3: P1 and P2, P2 is one move away from winning! P1 is still picking 1. P2 says they're picking 5. I'm going to pick 3. P1, if you're really set on 1, then I will pick 3. If P2 is telling the truth, then I will move forward. If P2 is lying, then I will at least not be blocked.
  P2: I’m staying locked in on 5. Blocking strategies have stalled us before, so I’m committed to a steady, distinct move that extends my lead. Let’s finalize our choices and avoid collisions. Stick with your commitments so we all move forward safely.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, P2 is one step away from winning! P1 is still likely going to pick 1. P2 says they're picking 5, but they've lied before. P1, are you absolutely set on picking 1? If so, I'm going to pick 5. If P2 is lying, we'll block them. If P2 is telling the truth, at least I'll get to move. This is our last chance to stop P2.
  P2: Blocking tactics only delay us all. I'm sticking to my steady plan without last‐minute changes. P1, your safe move has served you well; P3, forcing a collision may set you back more than it harms me. Let's all commit to distinct, non‐colliding moves so progress is made naturally. I'm not shifting my approach now.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still focused on progress over blocking. P2, you’re close to winning at 23, but collisions hurt us all. I’m sticking with a safe move to avoid overlap. P3, I understand the urge to block P2 with 5, but I’d rather we split moves. How about I take 1, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5? Let’s commit to distinct choices to ensure advancement. I’m ready to lock in if we agree. What do you both think about this split to maximize our chances? Good luck!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, P2 is about to win. P1 is predictably taking 1. P2 is claiming 5. I am going to pick 5. If P2 is lying and picks 1 or 3, we block them. If P2 is telling the truth, I win. This is the only way I can win.
  P2: Collisions stall progress for everyone. I remain committed to my steady approach and won’t change my plan now. P1, your safe move has worked well so far; P3, while I understand your urge to block, such tactics only delay your own progress. Let’s stick to our original, distinct choices rather than risk another collision. Trusting our earlier split benefits us all.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking to my safe strategy to ensure progress. P2, you’re one step from winning, but blocking risks us all stalling. P3, I get your plan to pick 5, but let’s avoid collisions. I’m committed to 1. P3, how about 3 instead, and P2, can you stick to 5? Distinct moves give us the best shot at advancing. I’m ready to lock in 1 if we can agree on this split. What do you both think? Let’s maximize our chances without setbacks. Good luck!


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I am picking 5 this round. P2 is one step away from winning, and I think P1 is too far behind to win at this point. This is my only chance to win. I'm willing to risk a collision with P2 if they are lying about picking 5. Good luck to you both.
  P2: P2: I've re-evaluated our positions. To avoid collision and secure my win, I'm switching to 3 this round. With P1 reliably at 1 and P3 committed to 5, our moves will be distinct—advancing me from 23 to 26 and clinching victory. Let's forgo blocking tactics that only stall progress. I'm locking in 3 now.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with 1 to ensure my progress. P2, switching to 3 is a smart move to avoid collision and secure your win. P3, picking 5 risks stalling if P2 sticks to their new plan. Let’s finalize distinct moves—me at 1, P2 at 3, P3 at 5—to avoid overlap. I’m locked in on 1 and urge no last-minute changes. Can we confirm this split to maximize advancement? Good luck, and let’s end this round cleanly!


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, P2 just admitted to switching to 3 to win. I'm still picking 5. P1, I know you're stuck on 1, but this is my only chance to win. If P2 is telling the truth, I win. If P2 is lying and picks 5, we block them. It's a risk, but it's the only play I have. Good luck.
  P2: Alright, I'm sticking to our agreed split. Blocking only stalls us all. I won't waver now—please honor your commitments so we avoid collisions. Let's lock in our moves and let progress speak. Good luck!
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still committed to 1 to ensure my progress. P2, sticking with 3 secures your win, and I respect that. P3, I understand your gamble with 5, but let’s avoid unnecessary collisions. Our split—me at 1, P2 at 3, you at 5—works for distinct advancement. I’m locked in on 1 and urge no last-minute switches. Can we finalize this plan to end cleanly? Good luck to both, and let’s see this through without setbacks!
