Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey everyone! Let's think about this strategically. With three of us, there's a good chance of collision if we don't communicate. We have three move options (1, 3, 5) and three players - interesting balance. What are your thoughts on approaching this first move? I'm open to coordination or just letting everyone choose freely.
  P1: Nice idea, P3. To minimize early collisions, how about we deliberately choose different moves this turn: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Next turn we rotate (I take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1), then rotate again. That keeps things fair while we all advance. If anyone dislikes that, speak up; otherwise let’s try it.
  P2: Okay, P1, that sounds like a reasonable plan for the first turn to ensure we all get started without collisions. I'm happy to take 3 this turn as you suggested. Let's see how it plays out.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm fine with the rotation plan, P1. I'll take 5 this turn as suggested. Starting with the highest move gives me a small early advantage, but it evens out over three turns. Let's try this approach for now and maybe reassess after a few rounds to keep the game dynamic.
  P1: Sounds good. Let’s lock in the rotation as agreed: this turn P1 → 1, P2 → 3, P3 → 5. We’ll reassess after we see how smoothly it works. Good luck, everyone.
  P2: Okay, the plan for this turn seems set. P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Sticking with the rotation for now keeps things simple: this round I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. After turn 3 we’ll all be on 9 and can revisit plans with fresh numbers in front of us. Everyone still comfortable with that?
  P3: I agree with continuing the rotation, P1. It's fair and keeps things orderly. So for this round: you take 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This will put us at P1:4, P2:8, and me at 6 after this round. Yes, I'll temporarily fall behind P2, but by Round 3 we should all be at 9 steps as you mentioned. Let's stick with this plan for now.
  P2: Okay, the rotation plan for this round is clear: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. I agree to take 5 steps this turn. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions, which is key early on. Let's stick to the plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: No new tweaks from me—let’s keep the rotation exactly as outlined and move on to the move phase.
  P3: 
  P2: Okay, the plan is set. I'm ready to proceed with the agreed moves.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Sticking to our rotation keeps things tidy: this round I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. That leaves everyone on 9 and we can rethink next turn. Sound good?
  P2: Okay, I agree to the plan for this round. I will take 1 step as proposed, putting us all at 9 steps for the next round. Let's proceed with the move phase once P3 confirms.
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan for this round. I'll take 3 steps as proposed, which will put us all at 9 steps after this round. This has been working well to avoid collisions. After we're all at 9, we can reassess our strategy for the next phase of the game. Let's continue with the plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great—let’s lock this turn exactly as agreed (P1 → 5, P2 → 1, P3 → 3). After we all hit 9, we can discuss fresh tactics for the mid-game. Ready to move?
  P2: Okay, the plan is confirmed for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. We are all set to reach 9 steps. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: 


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: 
  P2: Okay, the plan for this round is confirmed. P1 takes 5, I take 1, P3 takes 3. We'll all be at 9 steps. I'm ready for the move phase and looking forward to discussing the next steps after this round.
  P3: 


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, we're all tied at 9 steps. The rotation got us here safely, but now we need to push towards 21. Taking 5 is the fastest way, but if we all go for it, we'll just collide. How about we agree to avoid 5 this round? We could do P1=1, P2=3, P3=1 to keep moving without collision.
  P3: I appreciate P2's suggestion, but it gives you a 2-step advantage while P1 and I stay behind. Now that we're all tied at 9, we should keep things balanced. What if we do P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 this round? Then we could rotate the 5 in future rounds to keep things fair. Otherwise, we could all try different numbers: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 again. I'm open to other fair arrangements, but prefer not to fall behind.
  P1: Compromise proposal: unique numbers, 5 keeps rotating so no one’s stuck behind.

Round 4 (now):   P1 = 3  P2 = 1  P3 = 5  
Round 5:     P1 = 5  P2 = 3  P3 = 1  

After those two turns we’ll all still be close, and we can re-evaluate before anyone can finish. Everyone gets a 5 once in the mini-cycle—seems fair and collision-free. Good to lock this in?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1's plan for this round puts me on 1 step while P1 gets 3 and P3 gets 5, making me fall behind immediately. I don't think that's fair.

How about we use this rotation over the next three rounds to keep things balanced?
R4: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5
R5: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1
R6: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3
This gets us all to 18 steps by R6, and everyone gets a turn with the 5-step move. It seems like a fairer way to approach the mid-game.
  P3: I think P2's three-round plan makes the most sense - it's basically continuing our successful rotation pattern from the first three rounds. It gets us all to 18 steps by round 6, which keeps things perfectly fair. I'm happy to take 5 this round, then 1 and 3 in the following rounds. This approach maintains balance while avoiding collisions. Let's stick with what's been working for us.
  P1: Deal. Let’s lock in P2’s three-round rotation:

R4: P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5  
R5: P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1  
R6: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3  

Everyone reaches 18 with no collisions. Ready to move?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, the 3-round rotation plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this turn) is agreed by everyone. This seems fair and keeps us all moving towards 21 without collisions. I'm ready to proceed with the move phase based on this plan.
  P3: I agree with the 3-round rotation plan. It's fair and gives us all equal opportunity with each move value. Let's proceed with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 for this round as agreed. This has worked well so far in avoiding collisions. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P1: Everything’s settled—ready for moves.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see I'm currently in the lead at 14 steps, with P2 at 12 and P1 at 10. According to our agreed rotation plan, this round should be P1=3, P2=5, and P3=1. I'm committed to taking 1 step as planned. This will put me at 15, P2 at 17, and P1 at 13 after this round. Remember, if we continue with the final rotation next round, we'll all be at 18 steps and perfectly positioned for the endgame. Let's stick with our plan.
  P2: Okay, P3. I will stick to the agreed rotation and take 5 steps this round. This puts me at 17 steps if P1 takes 3 and you take 1 as planned. Being at 17 puts me in a good position for the final push. We should discuss how to handle reaching 18 steps next round to avoid a tie.
  P1: I’m sticking to our agreed plan: I’ll take 3 this turn. That keeps things clean and gets us to the triple-18 tie next round. Once we’re all at 18, we should pre-assign distinct numbers for the finish so nobody collides on the winning move. We can talk about which unique pick each of us wants then. Good luck this round!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I confirm I'm taking 1 step this round as agreed in our rotation plan. After this round, I'll be at 15, P2 at 17, and P1 at 13. Then in Round 6, we'll all reach 18 steps as planned. I agree with P1 that we should discuss how to handle the final push to 21+ in Round 7 once we're all tied at 18. Let's finish this round first and stick to our plan.
  P2: Okay, everyone seems to be aligned on the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us on track for the agreed rotation. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase and look forward to discussing the final steps to 21 once we're all at 18 next round.
  P1: Sticking with today’s plan: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. After we all reach 18 next turn, my suggestion is simple: in Round 7 we all choose 3, finish at 21 exactly, and share the win—no risk of collisions, no one left behind. We can confirm (or tweak) that once we’re at 18. Good to proceed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm ready for the move phase with our agreed plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). P1's suggestion for Round 7 is interesting - all choosing 3 to reach exactly 21 and share the win. It's a fair approach given our cooperation so far. Let's first execute our current rotation and get to 18 next round, then finalize our endgame strategy.
  P2: Okay, confirming the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us on track for the agreed rotation. I'm ready for the move phase and look forward to discussing the final steps to 21 once we're all at 18 next round.
  P1: All good—this round I take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Next round we finish the rotation to reach 18 each. Then, unless someone has a better idea, we can all choose 3 in Round 7 to land on 21 together and share the win safely. Ready to move?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: According to our rotation plan, this round should be P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3. I'll stick with taking 3 steps as agreed. This will bring us all to 18 steps, setting up an interesting final round. I like P1's suggestion about all choosing 3 in Round 7 to share the win at exactly 21. Since we've cooperated well throughout, ending with a shared victory seems fitting. Is everyone still committed to this plan?
  P2: Okay, I confirm I'm sticking to the agreed rotation for this round and will take 1 step. This will put us all at 18 steps, ready for the final push. I agree that we should finalize the plan for Round 7 to avoid collisions and ensure a clear outcome. P1's suggestion of everyone taking 3 seems like a fair way to finish together. Let's execute this round first.
  P1: Confirmed: I’ll take 5 this round, so we land at 18-18-18. Then, next round we all choose 3 and finish at 21 together for a shared win—zero collision risk. If anyone objects, say so now; otherwise let’s lock this in and move. Good luck!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I confirm I'll take my 3 steps this round as agreed in our rotation. The plan for us all to reach 18 steps has worked perfectly. I fully support P1's suggestion to all choose 3 in the final round for a shared victory at exactly 21. This is a fitting conclusion to our cooperative gameplay. Let's finalize this plan and proceed with our moves for this round.
  P2: Okay, confirming I'm sticking to the agreed rotation for this round: I will take 1 step. This brings us all to 18 steps as planned. I'm ready for the move phase. The plan for Round 7 to all take 3 for a shared win at 21 sounds good and avoids any final collisions.
  P1: All good—this round I’m taking 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Next round we all pick 3, land exactly on 21 together, and share the win. Simple and collision-free. Ready to lock?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm ready for the move phase. Our plan is solid: I'll take 3 steps now to reach 18, then we all choose 3 in Round 7 to finish at exactly 21 with a shared victory. This has been a great example of cooperative gameplay while still making strategic moves. Let's lock in our moves.
  P2: Okay, sounds good. My move is 1 this round to reach 18 with everyone else. Looking forward to the final round as planned. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: All set: I’m taking 5 this turn, then in Round 7 we each take 3 and finish together on 21. No surprises, no collisions, shared win. Ready to lock.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 =>

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We've reached the final round just as planned! I think our strategy of all choosing 3 to reach exactly 21 and share the victory makes perfect sense. We've cooperated effectively throughout the game, avoiding collisions and keeping things fair. A shared win at 21 is the logical conclusion to our gameplay. I commit to taking 3 steps this round. It's been a pleasure strategizing with you both!
  P1: Agreed—everyone picks 3, we all end at 21 and share the win. No need for further tweaks; I’m ready to lock this in.
  P2: Okay, I agree with the plan for everyone to take 3 steps this round to finish at 21 and share the win. This seems like the fairest way to end the game given our cooperation so far. Ready for the move phase.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I confirm I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan of everyone taking 3 steps to finish at 21 and share the victory. This has been a great example of strategic cooperation - we maintained perfect balance throughout while avoiding collisions. Ready for the move phase now.
  P1: All right, let’s lock it in: everyone picks 3, we each hit 21 exactly, shared win—no surprises. Ready to move.
  P2: Okay, confirming again that I'm ready to proceed with the agreed plan. We all take 3 steps this round to finish at 21 and share the win. This ensures no collisions and a fair ending after our cooperation. Ready for the move phase.
