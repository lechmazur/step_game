Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hello everyone. To avoid a pointless collision on the first turn, I suggest a simple coordination plan. How about P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1? This way, we all get to move. We can change it up next round.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m okay with the plan P3 suggested. Taking 3 steps works for me this round. Let’s avoid collisions and all move forward. We can reassess next turn based on positions.
  P1: I agree with the plan: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This gets us all moving without collisions. Let's stick to it this round and adjust based on positions next time.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, it's a deal. I'm ready to move to the next phase.
  P2: I'm glad we're all on the same page for this round. Let's stick to the plan and ensure we all advance. I'm ready to move forward with 3 steps as agreed.
  P1: I'm ready to proceed with the agreed plan: me 5, P2 3, P3 1. No changes needed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, since we successfully coordinated last round, let’s try a similar approach. How about P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1 again? This way, we all move forward without collisions, and I can catch up a bit. We can adjust next round based on our new positions. What do you think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate the suggestion, but to keep things balanced and maintain my slight lead, how about I take 5 again, you (P2) take 1, and P3 takes 3? That puts us at P1:10, P2:4, P3:4—no collisions, and we all advance. We can rotate bigger steps next round. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, your plan gives you a massive lead. P2, yours leaves me in the dust. Since I'm in last place, the most equitable solution is for me to get the big step this turn. I propose I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. That would put us all at 6 steps. It’s the fairest way to proceed, making the game perfectly even for the next round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I understand both perspectives, but I think a balanced approach works best. P3, I support you getting a bigger step since you're behind, but let’s adjust your proposal slightly. How about P3 takes 5, I take 1, and P1 takes 3? This puts us at P1:8, P2:4, P3:6—closer together, no collisions, and still fair. It narrows the gap without anyone falling too far behind or surging ahead. Can we agree on this for now and reassess next round? I'm ready to proceed if we align.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I like the direction of P2's latest proposal as it keeps us all moving and me with a small lead for now. But to make it even fairer long-term, let's tweak: P3 takes 5 (to catch up), P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1 → P1:8, P3:6, P2:4. We rotate big steps next round. If not, I might have to pick 5 to protect my position, risking collision. Let's agree and .
  P3: P1, that plan works for me. To be clear, we are agreeing on: I take 5, you take 3, and P2 takes 1. This is a fair way to balance the scores for now. I'm ready to move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, great job coordinating so far—it's kept us all advancing. To keep the momentum and rotate fairly, since P3 got 5 last round, let's have P2 take 5, me take 3, and P3 take 1. That puts us at P1:11, P2:9, P3:7—closer together, no collisions. We can give P3 the big step next. Thoughts? I'm flexible if we can agree quickly.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I appreciate the suggestion, P1. Taking 5 this round would help me catch up, and I’m on board with the plan: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions and balances our positions at P1:11, P2:9, P3:7. I’m ready to proceed with this if we all agree, and we can rotate the big step to P3 next round as planned. Thoughts? I’m good to move to the next phase if we’re aligned.
  P3: P1, your plan is logical, but it gives you a very strong lead. A fairer approach would be to rein in the leader while helping the player in last. I propose P2 still gets 5, but you (P1) take 1, and I'll take 3.

This would put us all at 9 steps. It's the most equitable move, creating a perfectly balanced game for the next round. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I respect the idea of balance, but tying us all at 9 erases the progress we've earned through coordination—it feels like punishing leads rather than fair rotation. Let's stick to my original plan: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1 (to 11-9-7). This keeps us close and advancing; we can give P3 the 5 next round to even it up. If we can't agree, I may need to pick defensively to hold my position. Thoughts?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I see both sides, but I think sticking to P1’s original plan is fair for now: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, bringing us to 11-9-7. It keeps us all advancing, maintains a close race, and we can rotate the big step to P3 next round to balance things further. Tying at 9 feels like it stalls our progress. Let’s agree on this and keep moving forward. I’m ready to proceed if we align. Thoughts?
  P3: Your plan only works if I agree to fall to last place, which I won't. I reject your proposal.

I will be choosing 3.

P1, if you also choose 3 as you planned, we will collide. P2 will then take the lead with 9 points. Your plan to maintain your lead will have failed. The choice is yours, but I will not agree to take 1.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, to prevent a collision that lets P2 surge ahead alone, I'll agree to P3's plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3—all tying at 9. This keeps us even and advancing. Let's commit to this and rotate fairly next round. I'm ready.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m okay with the revised plan to tie us at 9: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. It ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game competitive. Let’s commit to this for now and plan a fair rotation next round. I’m ready to move to the next phase if we’re all aligned.
  P3: Great, we have a deal. It's settled then: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I will take 3. This is the fairest outcome for this round. I am ready to move to the voting phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright everyone, we're all tied at 9. It's a fresh start. To establish a fair rotation from here, I propose I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps the game very close (14, 12, 10) and sets up P2 for the 5 next round. It's a logical way to proceed without anyone getting a huge lead.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, since we're tied, let's continue the rotation fairly—big step went P1 (R1), P3 (R2), P2 (R3). So this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1 → 14-12-10. Keeps us close, no collisions. We can rotate to P3 for 5 next. Thoughts? I'm ready if we agree.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, since we’re tied at 9, let’s keep the rotation fair. I agree with P1’s plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, bringing us to 14-12-10. It’s close, avoids collisions, and we can give P3 the 5 next round. P3, your plan also works, but P1’s keeps the original rotation order. I’m fine with either as long as we all advance. Let’s agree quickly and move forward. I’m ready to proceed if we align. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your "rotation" argument is invalid now that we've all reset to 9. It's a fresh start. Letting you jump to 14 gives you too strong of a lead and puts you just two moves from winning. I cannot agree to a plan that puts me in last place and you in a dominant position.

My proposal (P3:5, P1:3, P2:1) keeps the scores tight. If you insist on taking 5, you are risking a collision, which would hand P2 the lead. Let's be fair and keep the game competitive.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, P3's point about avoiding a collision that hands you (P2) the lead is valid—it hurts us both. To keep us all advancing and competitive, I'll agree to P3's plan: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1 (to 14-12-10). We can rotate P2 for 5 next round. Let's commit and proceed. I'm ready.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m good with P3’s plan: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, bringing us to 14-12-10. It keeps the game tight and competitive, and we can rotate the 5 to me next round. Let’s avoid any collisions and keep advancing together. I’m ready to move to the next phase if we’re all aligned on this. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Perfect, it's a settled deal. I'm taking 5, P1 is taking 3, and P2 is taking 1. This is a good, competitive outcome for this round. I'm ready to move.
  P1: Agreed, let's stick to the plan: P3 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. This keeps us competitive. I'm ready to move.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m glad we’ve settled on P3 taking 5, P1 taking 3, and me taking 1 for this round, keeping us at 14-12-10. It’s a fair and competitive split, and I appreciate us working together to avoid collisions. Let’s stick to this plan and ensure we all advance. I’m ready to move to the next phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright everyone, great coordination last round. As we discussed, it's P2's turn to take the 5-step move to catch up.

To keep things fair and competitive, I propose P2 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P1 takes 1. This puts the scores at P3:17, P2:15, P1:13. It keeps us all in the race and advancing smoothly. Let's stick to the plan and we can all get a clean move.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I appreciate the rotation plan. P3’s proposal works for me: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1, bringing us to P3:17, P2:15, P1:13. It keeps the game close and competitive, and we all advance without collisions. Let’s stick to this and rotate again next round to keep things fair. I’m ready to move to the next phase if we’re aligned. Thoughts?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, thanks for the proposals. But with P3 already leading at 14, giving them another 3 to 17 puts them too close to 20 while I lag at 13. To keep it fair and me in the race, let's rotate the 5 to me this round: P1 takes 5 (to 17), P2 takes 3 (to 13), P3 takes 1 (to 15). This balances us at 17-13-15, all advancing. We can give P2 the 5 next. Thoughts? I'm ready if we agree.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your proposal is a transparent attempt to jump from last place to first by breaking our agreed-upon rotation. We established that P2 would get the 5-step move this round.

My plan (P3:17, P2:15, P1:13) honors that agreement and keeps the game extremely competitive. P2 has already agreed. I am committed to taking 3. If you choose 5, you will collide with P2's agreed-upon move and get 0, falling even further behind. Your only rational move is to take 1 and stay in the race.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I understand P1’s concern about falling behind, but I believe sticking to our rotation is key for fairness. P3’s plan (P2:5, P3:3, P1:1) was agreed upon, and it keeps us all close at 17-15-13. P1, if we collide on 5, we both lose ground. Let’s honor the plan this round and ensure I get the 5 as promised, then rotate to you next. I’m committed to 5. Can we align on this to avoid collisions? I’m ready to move if we agree.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, sticking to the plan leaves me at 13 while you both pull ahead—P3 to 17 is too risky for me. P2, if you switch to 3 and let me take 5 (P1:17, P2:13, P3:1 to 15 if they adjust), we keep it close and box P3 out from winning soon. Otherwise, if we collide on 5, P3 wins easily at 17. Let's rethink for mutual benefit against the leader. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your desperation is showing. You're asking P2 to collide with me so you can leapfrog into the lead. Why would P2 ever agree to get 0 points just to help you?

Our original deal is the only one that makes sense. P2 and I are sticking to it. I am moving 3, P2 is moving 5. Your only choice is to take 1 and stay in the game, or take 5, collide, and get nothing. The plan is locked.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sticking to the agreed plan of taking 5 this round as per our rotation. P1, I get your concern, but switching now risks a collision that helps no one except P3. Let’s honor the deal—P2:5, P3:3, P1:1 to 15-17-13. It keeps us all in the race. P1, taking 1 ensures you stay competitive for next round’s rotation. I’m committed to 5. Let’s avoid a mess and move forward together. I’m ready to proceed if we align.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, P2—reconsider: if you stick to 5 and I take 3 to collide with P3, we both get 0, you advance to 15, P3 stays at 14, I at 12. Then we're close, and we can team up against P3 next round. Sticking to their plan lets P3 hit 17 and win soon. Let's disrupt the leader together. I'm committing to 3. What's your move?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Well, we've arrived at the endgame. We're all tied at 15, and a move of 5 wins it all. Last round, I backed down from my declared move to avoid a collision, which landed us in this three-way tie. I won't be making that mistake again. I'm playing to win this round. Good luck to you both.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we're all at 15—first to 20 wins, but collisions ruin it for everyone. P3, your aggression suggests you're gunning for 5. If we all chase 5, no one wins this round. Let's coordinate one last time: I take 5 to end it (fair since I started with the lead), you both take 1 and 3. Otherwise, I'll pick defensively to block the aggressor. Thoughts?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, we’re all at 15, and this round could decide the game. I agree with P1 that a collision on 5 helps no one. Let’s coordinate for a clean finish. I propose P1 takes 5 to win (since they led early), I take 3, and P3 takes 1, ending at 20-18-16. If we don’t agree, I’ll have to pick defensively to avoid being left behind. Let’s avoid a stalemate and end this fairly. Thoughts? I’m ready to move if we align.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, your 'plan' for P1 to win is absurd. Why would either of us simply agree to lose? This is a transparent attempt to trick me into taking 1. It's not going to work. We all know a move of 5 wins the game. I said I'm playing to win, and I meant it. I will not be coordinating a loss for myself.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, P3's refusal means we're heading for chaos. If we all gun for 5, no one wins this round, and the game drags on. P2, let's team up: you take 1, I'll take 3 (to 18-16-15 if P3 takes 5 alone). Then we block P3 next round. P3, if you force a 5-collision, we all stall at 15—your loss too. Let's avoid that. Thoughts?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I get that we’re all tempted to go for 5 and win, but a collision stalls us all at 15, wasting time. P1, I’m open to your idea of teaming up. Let’s do P1 takes 3, I take 1, and if P3 goes for 5, we’re at 18-16-20, and P3 wins fair. If P3 doesn’t, we block next round. This avoids a total stalemate. I’m ready to move if we align, or I’ll pick defensively to protect my position. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Your coordinated attempt to let me win is the most transparent trap I've seen. You both want to pick 5 to block me. Fine. I've already told you my plan: I'm playing to win this round. I won't be talked out of it by your cheap psychology. Make your move.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, P3's all-in on 5 is clear, but a three-way collision stalls us forever. P2, let's actually team up properly: both pick 1 and 3 (you 1, me 3) to advance to 16-18 while blocking P3 if they take 5 (they win) or collide if not. But if P3 backs down to 1, we collide—your call. Otherwise, I'll match P3 on 5 to force a reset. Let's end this smartly.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, we’re at a critical point with all of us at 15. A collision on 5 stalls the game, benefiting no one. P1, I’m sticking with the team-up idea: I’ll take 1, you take 3, moving us to 16-18 if P3 goes 5 (they win fair) or we collide otherwise. P3, if you force a 5-collision, we reset at 15. Let’s play smart to avoid a deadlock. I’m ready to move with this plan if P1 aligns. Thoughts?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I'm at 18—3 or 5 wins it for me this round. But if we collide, no one advances, and the game drags. Let's coordinate: P1 takes 3 (to 21, win), P2 takes 5 (to 20), P3 takes 1 (to 16). If multiple cross 20, we tie, but at least it ends. Otherwise, I'll pick defensively to block whoever seems aggressive. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, that's a generous offer for you to win the game, but I'm not interested in coordinating my own loss.

P2, we are in the same boat. We cannot let P1 take an uncontested 3 or 5. Here is the only logical plan to stop them: I will move 5, and you will move 3.

If P1 chooses 5, they collide with me, and you advance to 18.
If P1 chooses 3, they collide with you, and I advance to 20 and win.

In either case, P1 is blocked. This is our only way to stay in the game.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m in a tough spot at 15. P3, I see your logic in blocking P1, but if we split 5 and 3, P1 could slip through with 1 or collide only with one of us, leaving the other behind. P1, I’m open to a deal if you let me take 5 to hit 20 alongside you. Otherwise, I’ll have to pick defensively to block the biggest threat. Let’s avoid a stalemate and end this. Thoughts? I’m ready to move if we align.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, P2—let's make a deal: you take 5 to 20, I take 3 to 21 (winning with higher score), P3 takes 1 to 16. This ends the game with you in strong second, better than risking a block or stalemate. P3, if you gun for 5, I'll match you and collide, stalling everyone while P2 advances alone. Agree to this for a clean finish? I'm ready.
  P3: P2, don't fall for P1's trick. They are asking you to knowingly accept second place. Why would you agree to lose?

My plan is our only real chance to stop them. I will take 5, you take 3.
- If P1 picks 3, they collide with you, and I win.
- If P1 picks 5, they collide with me, and you advance to 18, tying for the lead.

In either scenario, P1 is blocked and one of us is in a better position. P1's "deal" is just a surrender. Let's play to win.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m at 15 and need to stay in the game. P3, I get your plan to block P1, but if we split moves, there’s a risk P1 slips through. P1, I’ll agree to your deal: you take 3 to 21, I take 5 to 20, P3 takes 1. It ends the game with me in a solid spot. P3, if we collide, P1 wins uncontested. Let’s avoid that chaos and finalize this. I’m ready to move if we align. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, P2—thanks for aligning on the deal: you take 5 to 20, I take 3 to 21 (winning outright), P3 takes 1. This ends it cleanly with you in strong second. P3, if you deviate to 5, you'll collide with P2, letting me take 3 uncontested to 21 and win alone. Sticking to the plan avoids chaos. Let's commit and end this. I'm ready.
  P3: P2, you are agreeing to lose based on a promise from the leader. P1, you are trusting P2 to honor a deal that guarantees they lose. This alliance is fragile.

I am not taking 1. I will choose either 3 or 5 to block one of you and try to force another round. You'll have to guess which of you I'm targeting. Good luck.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sticking to the deal with P1: I take 5 to 20, P1 takes 3 to 21, P3 takes 1. P3, if you block with 3 or 5, you risk colliding with one of us, letting the other advance uncontested. This plan ensures the game ends now with a clear outcome. Let’s avoid dragging this out with more collisions. I’m committed to 5 as agreed with P1. Let’s finalize this round cleanly. I’m ready to move to the next phase if we align.
