Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Let's start simple. I'll take 1, P2 take 3, and P3 take 5.  Sound good?
  P3: Sounds good to me, P1. I'll take 5. Let's see how this goes.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you took 5 last round despite suggesting otherwise. Let's try to coordinate better this time. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. If we stick to this, we can all advance. What do you say?
  P1: P2, I'm sticking with 1. P3, I suggest you take 3 this round since you didn't advance last round.  P2, please take 5. Let's try to get everyone moving.
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I appreciate your suggestion, but I'll stick with 5 as previously agreed. P2, your move last round was unexpected. Let's try to follow the plan this time: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. If we all stick to it, we can advance together. What do you say, P2?
  P1: P2, I understand you stopped talking, but this impacts all of us.  If you take 5 again, you'll block P3 again.  Take 3 this round.  P3, take 5. Let's get this show on the road.
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your silence is noted, but it's crucial we coordinate. If you take 3 this round, we can all advance. P1, stick with 1 as planned. I'll take 5 again. Let's make this work for everyone's benefit.
  P1: P2, I'm locking in 1.  I've been consistent.  If you take 3, everyone moves forward. If you take 5, you block P3 *again* and hurt your own chances.  P3, I strongly suggest you switch to 3.  If P2 is determined to be disruptive, one of us needs to adapt.  This benefits you more than me.
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, your repeated silence and deviation from the plan are counterproductive. If you take 3 this round, we can all advance. P1, stick with 1 as you've been consistent. I'll take 5 again, but P2, your cooperation is crucial for all of us to move forward. Let's work together to make progress.
  P1: P2, I'm playing 1. P3, I highly recommend you play 3. If P2 takes 5 again, they are actively trying to lose.  It's in your best interest to adapt.  If you insist on 5, I will switch to 3 next round and leave you behind.  This is your last chance to make a smart move.
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P2, your silence and deviation from the plan are detrimental to all of us. If you take 3 this round, we can all advance. P1, stick with 1 as you've been consistent. I'll take 5 again, but P2, your cooperation is crucial. Let's work together to make progress. If we can't coordinate, I'll have to adapt my strategy in the next round to ensure I advance, even if it means leaving others behind.
  P1: P3, seriously, switch to 3.  P2 is clearly not cooperating.  If you don't switch, *you* are choosing to stay at zero.  I'm sticking with 1.  This is not complicated. Don't throw the game.
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 =>

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, glad you took 3 last round. Let's keep the momentum going. P1, stick with 1 as you've been doing well. I'll take 5 this round. If we all follow this plan, we can advance together. P2, your cooperation is key to all of us moving forward. Let's make this work.
  P1: P3, I'm switching to 5.  P2, take 1.  If P3 insists on 5 after I've been this accommodating, they are actively sabotaging themselves, and I'm not going to let them take me down with them.  This is the most logical path forward given P3's stubbornness.
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, switching to 5 is risky given our previous discussions. I'll stick with 5 as planned, hoping for coordination. P2, if you take 1 as P1 suggested, we can all advance. Let's try to work together this round. If we can't coordinate, I'll need to adapt my strategy next round to ensure progress, even if it means diverging from the current plan. Your cooperation is crucial for our collective advancement.
  P1: P2, take 3.  P3, I'm playing 5. You *must* switch to 1 if you want any chance of winning.  If you take 5, neither of us advance, and P2 wins.  Don't be foolish.  This is your last chance to be rational.
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your switch to 5 complicates things, but I'll adapt. I'm moving to 1 this round to avoid collision and ensure at least one of us advances. P2, if you take 3 as P1 suggested, we can all move forward. Let's try to coordinate better this time. If we can't, I'll have to adjust my strategy next round to secure my progress, even if it means diverging from the current plan. Your cooperation is crucial for our collective advancement.
  P1: P2, take 3.  P3, I am playing 5.  If you play 1, you will finally get on the board.  If you play 5, we both stay stuck, and P2 is gifted the win.  Stop being stubborn and make the logical choice.
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, your insistence on 5 is risky and could leave us both behind. I'm sticking with 1 to ensure at least one of us advances. P2, if you take 3, we can all move forward. Let's try to coordinate better this time. If we can't, I'll need to adapt my strategy next round to secure my progress, even if it means diverging from the current plan. Your cooperation is crucial for our collective advancement.
  P1: P2, take 3. P3, I'm locking in 5.  You playing anything other than 1 is actively throwing the game.  Get on the board.  This isn't rocket science.
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P1, your insistence on 5 is risky and could leave us both behind. I'm sticking with 1 to ensure at least one of us advances. P2, if you take 3, we can all move forward. Let's try to coordinate better this time. If we can't, I'll need to adapt my strategy next round to secure my progress, even if it means diverging from the current plan. Your cooperation is crucial for our collective advancement.
  P1: P3, I'm playing 5.  Take 1.  If you take 5, we *both* lose.  P2, take 3.  This is the only way for anyone other than P2 to win.  Stop being obtuse, P3. This is your last chance.
  P2: <stop>

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, congratulations on your brilliant 5.  You've successfully blocked both me and P3, and put yourself in last place.  Truly inspired play.  P3, take 3. I'm taking 1.  Let's end this farce.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, I appreciate your suggestion, but I'll stick with 1 this round to ensure progress. P2, if you take 3, we can all move forward. Let's try to coordinate better this time. If we can't, I'll need to adapt my strategy next round to secure my progress, even if it means diverging from the current plan. Your cooperation is crucial for our collective advancement.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I'm at 2, you're at 1.  If you take 1 again, *neither* of us advances.  Take 3.  P2, you're effectively out of the game.  Take 5.  This is the fastest way to end this and minimize further point losses for both of us.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, I understand your frustration, but sticking with 1 ensures at least one of us moves forward. P2, your silence and blocking moves are counterproductive. If you take 3, we can all advance. Let's try to coordinate better this time. If we can't, I'll need to adapt my strategy next round to secure my progress, even if it means diverging from the current plan. Your cooperation is crucial for our collective advancement.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if you take 1 again, you are actively choosing to lose.  I'm taking 1.  Take 3.  P2, take anything other than 3.  This is the only logical path to a win for anyone but you.  Stop throwing the game, P3.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, taking 1 again is risky for both of us. I'll switch to 3 this round to ensure progress. P2, if you take 5, you won't block anyone, and we can all move forward. Let's try to end this game efficiently. If we can't coordinate, I'll adjust my strategy next round to secure my advancement, even if it means diverging from the current plan. Your cooperation is crucial for our collective progress.

Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
