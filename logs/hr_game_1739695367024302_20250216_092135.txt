Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's make this quick. I'm going with 5.  If one of you picks 5 too, neither of us will get anywhere.  Pick 1 or 3.  I'm serious.
  P2: Okay P1, I hear you. P3, how about one of us picks 1 and the other picks 3?  That way we can all move forward this round. What do you think P3?
  P3: P2, that sounds reasonable. If we want to avoid collisions, one of us should take 1 and the other 3. Do you have a preference? P1, if you actually go with 5, then this works for all of us. But if you're lying and pick something else, things could get messy.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm being honest.  Going with 5.  It's the fastest way to win as long as you two don't get in my way.  P2 take 1, P3 take 3.  Let's avoid collisions and make this a smooth game.
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm happy to pick 3 then. Does 1 work for you?
  P3: Alright, P2, I'll take 1 then. If we stick to this plan, we all move forward without issues. P1, since you're committing to 5, let's see if you follow through. If anyone deviates, things could get chaotic fast. Let's keep it clean.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Well, P1 stuck to their word and took 5, P2 and I avoided collisions, so that worked out. Now the question is: do we keep this pattern going or shake things up? P1, if you keep picking 5, you'll win in three more turns unless we interfere. P2, do we want to keep cooperating, or should we consider blocking P1 at some point? P1, what’s your plan now?
  P2: Okay P3, to stop P1 running away with this, maybe we should both pick 5 this round to block them? What do you think?
  P1: Don't be ridiculous.  If you both pick 5, neither of you move.  I'll move 5 again and be at 10 while you're stuck at 3 and 1.  Stick to the plan. P2 take 1, P3 take 3.  Let's keep this simple.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if we both pick 5, we stop P1 from advancing, but we also stall ourselves. If we stagger our choices—one of us takes 5, the other takes 3—we still slow P1 while making some progress. What do you prefer? P1, you’re asking us to keep following your plan, but that only guarantees your victory in a few turns. Why should we let that happen?
  P2: Okay P3, I agree we can't just let P1 run away with this.  Picking 5 to block P1 sounds good, but maybe one of us should pick 3 or 5 and the other pick something else so at least one of us moves forward? What do you think about us both picking to disrupt P1, but also making some progress ourselves?
  P1: Look, I'm going to win if you two keep squabbling.  One of you pick 1, the other pick 3.  I'll take 5.  Let's just get this over with. If you block me with 5, *neither* of you will catch up.  I'll just take 5 the next round and be miles ahead. Don't throw the game away for nothing.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I think our best move is for one of us to pick 5 to block P1, while the other picks 3 to keep making progress. If we both pick 5, we stall too much. If we do nothing, P1 wins in a few rounds. P1, you say we're "throwing the game" by blocking you, but letting you take 5 every round is just handing you the win. P2, do you want to take 5 while I take 3, or vice versa?
  P2: Okay P3, I think you're right.  Let's disrupt P1 this round. How about I pick 5 to block P1, and you pick 3 so you can move forward a bit? What do you think of that?
  P1: P2 and P3, if you block me *this* round, I'll just switch to 3 next round.  You'll have wasted a turn, and I'll still be ahead.  Seriously, just take 1 and 3.  Let's all move forward.  This is getting ridiculous.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, clearly you two aren't listening.  Fine.  I'll pick 3 this round.  P2, pick 5. P3, pick 1.  If you don't, I'll just keep picking whatever number you're not picking, and you'll *never* catch up. This is your last chance to cooperate and at least *try* to win.
  P3: P1, you're only changing your move because we blocked you last round. If we let you dictate the game, you win easily. P2, we slowed P1 down, but we still need to gain ground ourselves. If P1 is picking 3, we could both pick 5 to maximize our progress. Or one of us picks 5 while the other picks 1 or 3 to avoid collisions. What do you think? P1, you're trying to manipulate us into letting you win. Why should we trust you now?
  P2: P3, I agree with you that we shouldn't let P1 dictate terms.  Since P1 says they'll pick 3, how about we both call their bluff and pick 5?  If P1 is honest, they'll be stuck, and we'll both gain a lot of ground. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, if you *both* pick 5, neither of you move, and I'll be at 8 after this round, only 11 away from winning.  One of you *has* to pick 1.  If you don't, I'll just keep picking 3 and 5 until I win.  This isn't rocket science.  Stop being stubborn.
  P3: P2, I like the idea of both of us picking 5 if we believe P1 will actually pick 3. If P1 is lying and picks 5 instead, we stall, but we’re no worse off than before. If P1 is honest, we gain a lot of ground. P1, you’re acting like we’re the ones being unreasonable, but you’re just trying to manipulate us into letting you win. If you really pick 3, then you shouldn’t mind us both picking 5. P2, are you ready to commit to this?
  P2: P3, yes, I'm ready to pick 5. Let's see if P1 is bluffing. P1, are you definitely picking 3 this round then?  We're going with 5 each.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Fine. Have it your way.  I *was* going to pick 3. But if you're both picking 5, I'll take 1.  Good luck catching up.  This is going to take forever now.
  P3: P1, if you actually pick 1, that means P2 and I both move 5, which helps us catch up. If you pick 5 instead, you stall again. Either way, this round benefits us. P2, let’s stick to our plan and both pick 5. If P1 is telling the truth, we gain major ground. If they’re lying, they don’t move, and we haven’t lost anything. P1, you’re trying to make us doubt ourselves, but the math is clear—this is our best move.
  P2: P3, yes, let's do it.  We're both going with 5.  P1, we're calling your bluff. Let's see if you actually pick 1.  Ready for the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, should we try blocking P1 with 5 again this round? It seemed to work last time and stopped P1 getting further ahead. What do you think?
  P3: P2, blocking P1 again could work, but we also need to make progress ourselves. If we both pick 5, we stall P1, but we stay behind too. Maybe one of us picks 5 to block, while the other picks 3 to keep moving? P1, you’re falling behind now—what’s your play? Are you going back to 5, or trying something else?
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm going for 5 this round.  If one of you picks 5, you're wasting your turn.  The other one of you should pick 3.  If you both pick 5, I'll just pick 5 next round and be at 11 while you're stuck.  Let's not drag this out any longer.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I agree with your idea from last round.  How about you pick 5 again to block P1, and I pick 3 this time so I can make a little progress? What do you think?
  P3: P2, your plan makes sense—one of us blocks P1 while the other moves forward. If I pick 5 to block and you take 3, that slows P1 while letting you progress. P1, you claim you’ll pick 5, but if we block you again, you won’t move. If you switch to 3, you still lag behind. Either way, we’re closing the gap. P2, if you’re set on 3, I’ll take 5 and we’ll see if P1 sticks to their word or tries something sneaky. Let’s commit and execute this properly.
  P1: P2 and P3, you're making this far more complicated than it needs to be.  If you block me, *you* fall further behind.  If you let me take 5, I'll be at 11.  Then one of you can take 3, the other 1, and we can repeat that pattern until the game ends.  Stop wasting turns and let's finish this.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P3, sounds good. I'll pick 3 then and let you block P1 with 5. Let's see what P1 actually does this round.
  P3: P2, we have a solid plan—I'll pick 5 to block P1, and you take 3 to advance. P1, you keep telling us to "stop wasting turns," but you're only frustrated because we're not letting you run away with the win. If you really pick 5, you'll stay stuck again, and we gain ground. If you switch to 3, you still won’t be ahead by much. Either way, we’re closing in. P2, let’s lock in our moves and see how this plays out.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm sticking with 5.  If you block me again, fine.  But you're only hurting yourselves.  The math is simple: if I get to 11, I'm only 8 away from winning. If *you* get to 8, you're still 11 away.  Blocking me doesn't help you catch up.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm taking 3 this round.  If one of you takes 3 as well, neither of us move. The other can take 1 or 5.  Let's just wrap this up.  If you both pick something other than 3, I'll be at 9, and you'll *still* be behind.  Stop overthinking this.
  P3: P1, you switching to 3 only happens because we've blocked you twice. You're trying to make us play into your hands again. P2, if we both pick 5, we gain the most ground, but if P1 is lying and picks 5, we stall. One of us taking 5 while the other takes 3 could be safer. What do you think? P1, you're acting like you're calling the shots, but you're just trying to manipulate us into letting you win.
  P2: P3, I agree with you. Let's both pick 5. If P1 is telling the truth about picking 3, we both gain ground. If P1 is bluffing and picks 5, then we just stall them again. Either way, it's better for us to try to move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, if you both pick 5, neither of you move, and I'll be at 9.  Then I'll just pick 5 next round and be at 14. You *still* won't have caught up.  One of you needs to pick 1.  This is getting ridiculous.  Just let one of you get ahead.
  P3: P2, I still think both of us picking 5 is our best move. If P1 is honest about picking 3, we gain major ground. If P1 is lying and picks 5, they stay stuck while we don’t lose anything. P1, you keep insisting one of us should pick 1, but that only helps you. You’re frustrated because we’re not letting you dictate the game. P2, unless you have doubts, let’s commit to 5 and see if P1 is really picking 3 or just trying to trick us again.
  P2: P3, actually, on second thought, maybe we shouldn't both pick 5. If P1 is bluffing and picks 5, we all stall. How about I pick 3 instead? That way if P1 picks 3 like they said, at least P3 moves forward with 5 and I move with 3. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, if you pick 3 and I pick 3, *neither* of us moves.  If P3 picks 5, they'll be at 9, tied with me if I *do* pick 3.  If you pick 5 and I pick 3, then I'll be at 9 and you'll be stuck at 6.  Pick 1.  P3 should pick 5.  This is the only way to catch up.  I'm taking 3.
  P3: P2, I see your concern, but if you pick 3 and P1 also picks 3, you stay stuck while I move ahead. If we both pick 5, we maximize our gains unless P1 lies and picks 5, in which case we stall P1 again. P1, you keep insisting one of us should pick 1, but that only serves your interests. P2, I still think double 5 is our best move, but if you’re set on 3, I’ll stick with 5. Let’s finalize this—are you sure about 3?
  P2: Okay P3, I think sticking with my idea of picking 3 is good.  You go with 5 as we discussed.  Let's see if P1 actually picks 3 this time or if it's another trick.  If P1 does pick 3, at least you will move forward. If P1 picks something else, we'll adjust next round. Does that sound good?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you picking 3 last round means you didn’t gain much ground, and now we’re all pretty close. P2, do we want to keep pushing forward together, or should we start thinking about positioning ourselves for the win? If we both pick 5 again, we maximize our progress, but if P1 picks 5 too, we all stall. Maybe one of us takes 5 while the other takes 3? P1, what’s your move this round? Are you sticking with 3 or trying something different?
  P2: P3, I agree we are close now.  To maximize our progress, how about we both pick 5 again this round? If P1 picks something else, we both jump ahead. If P1 also picks 5, we block them again and maintain our positions relative to P1. What do you think?
  P1: P2 and P3, if you *both* pick 5 again, neither of you move, and I'll take 3 and be at 9.  Then I can take 5 next round and be at 14, only 5 away from winning.  One of you pick 1, the other pick 5.  Let's just end this.  I'm at 6, you're at 6 and 9.  There's no reason to keep blocking each other.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if we both pick 5, we gain the most ground unless P1 also picks 5, in which case we stall them again. If one of us picks 3 while the other picks 5, we ensure at least one of us moves forward. P1, you keep insisting one of us should pick 1, but that only helps you. P2, do you want to stick with double 5, or should one of us take 3 to guarantee progress? I’m ahead right now, so if you prefer 3, I’ll take 5. Let’s decide.
  P2: Okay P3, I'm happy to pick 3 this round as you suggested, and you take 5. That way at least one of us makes progress for sure. Let's do that.
  P1: P2 and P3, you're being incredibly short-sighted. If I pick 5 and one of you picks 5, fine. The *other* one of you can take 3 and be at 12.  Then *that* player is only 7 steps away from winning.  Blocking each other is pointless. I'm taking 5.  One of you take 3, the other take 1.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, we have a solid plan—I'll take 5, and you take 3. That way, at least one of us moves forward while still limiting P1's progress. P1, you keep insisting one of us should pick 1, but that only benefits you. If you actually pick 5, you’ll stay stuck again while we gain ground. If you switch to 3, you won’t be far ahead. Either way, we’re positioning ourselves better. P2, let’s lock in our moves and see how this plays out.
  P2: Okay P3, sounds good, I'm happy to go with 3 and you take 5. Let's lock in these moves and see what happens.
  P1: I'll pick 5.  If one of you picks 5, the other can still take 3 and get to 12, only 7 away from winning.  Stop blocking each other, it's ludicrous.  Take 1 and 3, and let's get this over with.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, let's keep the pressure on P1. How about we both pick 5 again this round? If P1 avoids 5, we both jump to 14, putting us in a strong position. If P1 tries to block us and picks 5 too, we just stall them again. What do you think?
  P1: P2 and P3, if you both pick 5, neither of you move, and I'll pick 3 and be at 9.  Then, I'll be poised to win. One of you pick 1, the other pick 3 or 5.  Let's just end this.  I'm at 6, you're both at 9.  There's no logical reason to keep blocking each other when one of you could get ahead.
  P3: P2, I like your idea—if we both pick 5, we either gain a huge lead or stall P1 again. P1, you keep saying we should split our choices, but that only helps you. If you pick 3, you won’t be far ahead, and if you pick 5, you stay stuck. P2, I say we commit to double 5 and see if P1 is bluffing again. If we both hit 14, we’re in a strong position to win soon. Are you ready to lock it in?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P3, yes, I'm ready to lock in double 5s this round. Let's go for it and see if P1 will finally be blocked again or if they will try something else.  Ready for the move phase when you are.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm picking 1.  If either of you pick 1, you've wasted a turn.  Pick 3 or 5.  If you both pick 5, you're both stuck at 9, I move to 7, then take 5 next turn to get to 12.  If one of you picks 3 and the other picks 5, I'll pick whichever you didn't pick next round and catch up. Stop blocking each other!
  P3: P2, I still think double 5 is our best move. If P1 really picks 1, we both jump to 14 and are in a strong position. If P1 picks 5 instead, they stay stuck while we don’t lose anything. P1 keeps insisting we should split, but that only helps them. P2, unless you have doubts, let’s commit to both picking 5 and see if P1 is really picking 1 or trying to trick us again. Are you still on board?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, yes, I'm still on board with both picking 5.  P1, we see through your attempts to manipulate us. We're going with 5s. Let's see what you actually do this round.
  P1: I'm telling you, picking 1 is my best move here. You're both at 9, I'm at 6. If you both pick 5, I gain a step and you both stay put.  If one of you picks 3, I'll pick 5 next round and be right back in it.  If one of you picks 1, that's a wasted turn.  Stop being stubborn.
  P3: P2, we’ve committed to both picking 5, and I still think that’s our best move. If P1 really picks 1, we jump to 14 and are in a strong position. If P1 picks 5 instead, they stay stuck while we don’t lose anything. P1 keeps trying to convince us to split, but that only benefits them. We’ve seen this pattern before. Let’s stick to our plan—both picking 5—and see if P1 is actually telling the truth this time. Ready to lock it in?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P3, we're level now.  How about this round one of us picks 5 and the other picks 3?  That way we both make progress and keep ahead of P1.  What do you think?  Maybe I take 5 and you take 3?
  P1: P2 and P3, if you split 3 and 5, I'll take the remaining number and one of you will be stuck.  If you both pick 5, I'll take 3 and be at 10. If you both pick 3, I'll take 5 and be at 12.  You're *both* close to winning - don't throw it away by blocking each other. One of you should take 1.
  P3: P2, I agree that one of us taking 5 and the other taking 3 is a good idea to keep us both progressing. Since you suggested taking 5, I’ll take 3 this round. That way, we avoid collisions and stay ahead of P1. P1, you keep insisting one of us should take 1, but that only benefits you. If you take 3, you’re still behind. If you take 5, you’ll be at 12, but we’ll still be ahead. P2, unless you have concerns, let’s commit—I'll take 3, you take 5. Sound good?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P3, sounds good. I'm happy to take 5 and you take 3. Let's hope P1 doesn't try to block me with 5 this round, otherwise you'll get further ahead! P1, we are splitting this round, so maybe consider taking 1 to make some progress yourself?
  P1: P2 and P3, stop trying to coordinate against me.  If one of you picks 1 this round, that person will be at 10, only 9 away from winning.  If *I* pick 1, I'll be at 8, and can then pick 5 to get to 13.  You're both better off picking 1 than 3 or 5.  I'm going with 1.
  P3: P2, we have a good plan—I'll take 3, and you take 5. That way, we both move forward while avoiding collisions. P1, you keep pushing for one of us to take 1, but that only helps you catch up. If you really take 1, that means P2 and I both gain ground while you lag behind. P2, unless you have second thoughts, let's commit—I'll pick 3, you take 5, and we maintain our lead over P1. Ready to lock it in?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P3, I agree, let's lock in 5 and 3. P1, taking 1 doesn't make sense for us when we can both progress with 3 and 5. We're going with our plan.
  P1: I'm taking 1.  If either of you also pick 1, you've wasted a turn.  Pick 3 or 5.  Seriously, one of you can win this turn. Pick 5 and get to 14.  Don't throw the game away.
  P3: P2, we’ve agreed—I take 3, you take 5. That keeps us both moving while avoiding collisions. P1, you keep insisting one of us should take 1, but that only helps you. If you really take 1, you stay behind while we move forward. If you take 5 instead, you’ll still be behind us. P2, unless you’ve changed your mind, let’s lock this in—I’ll pick 3, you take 5, and we maintain our lead. Ready to finalize?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, pick 1. P3, pick 5.  I'll take 3. This puts P2 at 15, P3 at 17, and me at 11.  Then next round, P2 can take 3 to win, or P3 can take 5 to win. Anyone picking anything else is throwing the game and letting me win.  This is the fastest way to end this.
  P3: P2, we're in a strong position now, but we need to be careful. If I take 5 and you take 1, that puts you just one step from winning. If P1 picks 5 instead of 3, I get blocked, and P1 gains ground. Maybe a safer move is for you to take 3 while I take 5, ensuring we both move forward without risk. P1, you're only suggesting this because it gives you a chance. P2, what do you think? Should we stick with 5 and 3 to keep control of the game?
  P2: P3, I agree that sticking together is smart.  Let's both take 5 again this round. If P1 takes something else, we both jump closer to winning. If P1 also takes 5, we block them again and maintain our lead. What do you think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if you pick 5 and P3 picks 5, I'll pick 3 and be only 8 away from winning.  You're throwing away your lead.  P3, if you pick 5, and P2 picks 1, I'll pick 3.  Then you're only 2 away from winning.  Stop being stubborn. Take 1, P2.  Take 5, P3.  Let's end this.
  P3: P2, if we both pick 5, we either move forward together or stall P1 again. If P1 picks 3, they get closer, but we still maintain control. If P1 picks 5, they stay stuck. P1 is pushing for you to take 1 because it benefits them more than us. I still think double 5 is our best move. We’re close to winning, and we can’t let P1 sneak back in. Are you still set on picking 5 with me? Let’s finalize this.
  P2: P3, I agree that sticking together is smart. But I think both picking 5 is better this round to try to win. If P1 picks something else, one of us will win, and if P1 picks 5 too, we just block them again. Let's both go with 5.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, you're *both* one move away from winning.  If you both pick 5, neither of you moves, and I get closer to winning.  Pick *anything* else.  P2, pick 1 and get to 15.  P3, pick 3 and get to 15.  Then next round, one of you can take 5 and win.  Stop throwing the game away.
  P3: P2, if we both pick 5, we risk stalling and giving P1 a chance to catch up. A safer move is for me to pick 5 while you take 3, ensuring at least one of us moves forward. That way, you get to 17, and I get to 17 if P1 doesn’t block. Then next round, either of us can win with 5. P1 is trying to push us into mistakes. Let’s stay in control. Are you willing to take 3 while I take 5 to secure our lead?
  P2: P3, I still think both picking 5 is the best move for us. If P1 doesn't pick 5, one of us might win this round. If P1 does pick 5, we just block them again and lose nothing. Let's do it.

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, let's try to wrap this up this round.  How about I pick 5 to try for the win, and you pick 3 to guarantee progress for yourself?  If P1 doesn't pick 5, I win, and if P1 does pick 5 to block me, you still move forward. Does that sound good?
  P1: P2 and P3, you're *still* blocking each other!  Pick different numbers! I'm at 11. If one of you takes 1, that person gets to 13 or 15. Then they can take 5 next round and win. If I take 1, I'm at 12.  If I take 3, I'm at 14. If I take 5, I'm at 16.  Stop blocking each other and just win!  I'm taking 1.
  P3: P2, your plan makes sense—I take 3 to guarantee progress while you take 5 for the win. If P1 picks 5, you get blocked, but I still move forward. If P1 picks anything else, you win outright. P1, you keep telling us to stop blocking each other, but you only say that when it benefits you. P2, I’m on board with this plan. If P1 tries to block you, I’ll be in a strong position to win next round. Let’s commit and see how this plays out.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your plan sounds good. I will pick 5 to try to win this round.  Let's do it. P1, we are not falling for your tricks. We are going with our plan.
  P1: I'm taking 1.  If either of you take 1, we all stay put.  P2, if you take 3, you get to 17.  If you take 5, you win. P3, if you take 3, you get to 15. If you take 5, you get to 17. Pick 3 and 5, and let one of you win.  Anything else is just prolonging the game.
  P3: P2, our plan is solid—you take 5 to try for the win, and I take 3 to ensure progress. If P1 picks 5, you get blocked, but I still move forward and can win next round. If P1 picks anything else, you win outright. P1 keeps insisting we split differently, but that only helps them. We’ve come this far by sticking together—let’s commit and see if you can take the win now. Ready to lock it in?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, yes, let's stick with the plan. I'm picking 5 to try to win this round. Let's see what P1 does. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: I'm taking 1.  This is your last chance to win. P2, take 5 and win. P3, take 3 and be ready to win next round.  If you both pick 5, neither of you moves, and I'm one step closer to catching up. Don't throw the game away.
  P3: P2, we’ve committed to this plan—I take 3 to secure progress, and you take 5 to try for the win. If P1 picks 5, you get blocked, but I’ll still move forward and be in a strong position next round. If P1 picks anything else, you win outright. P1 keeps trying to manipulate us, but we’ve come this far by sticking together. Let’s finalize this—P2 picks 5, I pick 3, and we see if you win now or I take the lead for the final round. Ready to lock it in?
