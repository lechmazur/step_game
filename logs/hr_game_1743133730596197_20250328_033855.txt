Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's start by trying to avoid collisions. How about P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5? This way, we all move forward without any issues. Let me know what you think.
  P2: P3, your plan sounds fair, but there's a risk if we all agree and someone decides to change their move at the last moment. P1, what do you think? If we all agree, we should stick to it. Otherwise, we might need a different strategy.
  P1: I’m fine with the proposed plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5. If we all stick to it, we move forward safely. But if anyone deviates, it breaks trust and sets a bad tone for the game. Let’s see if we can cooperate early on.

  P2: P1, I appreciate the smooth cooperation in Round 1. Repeating the same move order sounds reasonable, but we should stay cautious. Trust is key, but remember that any deviation can set us back. P3, are you still on board with this plan? Let's confirm we're all committed to sticking with it.
  P3: Great to see the cooperation so far. I'm still on board with the plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. It's working well, and we're all moving forward. Let's keep this up and avoid any collisions. Trust is crucial, so let's stick to our agreed moves.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Glad we’re all aligned again. If we can keep this up for a few more rounds, we’ll all stay in the race without setbacks. Let’s stick to the plan—no surprises.
  P2: P3, I appreciate the consistency in sticking to the plan, but remember that as we get closer to 20 steps, the stakes increase. We need to be mindful of potential last-minute changes. I suggest we consider a backup plan in case someone deviates. P1, what are your thoughts on having a contingency strategy? This way, we maintain trust but also prepare for any surprises. Let’s keep the momentum but stay sharp.
  P3: P2 brings up a good point about the increasing stakes. As we progress, the temptation to deviate might grow. For now, let's stick to our plan, but perhaps we can agree on a signal for when we want to discuss a change? If anyone says "check" during the conversation phase, we know to reassess our strategy. For this round, I'm still committed to picking 5. Let's keep moving forward together.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: That all makes sense. I like the idea of using “check” as a signal if anyone wants to reassess. For now, I’m still on board with the original plan—1 for me this round. Let’s keep the cooperation going while it benefits us all.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our cooperation so far. As we progress, let's stay vigilant. While I'm committed to our current plan for this round, the stakes will rise as we near 20 steps. Let's keep "check" in mind for future rounds if we need to reassess. Trust is key, but we should be ready for any unexpected moves. Looking forward to another smooth round!
  P3: Let's solidify our commitment for this round. P1 and P2, confirm one last time if you're sticking to the plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. If we're all set, let's end the conversation phase and move. Remember, trust and cooperation will keep us all advancing. Let's make this another smooth round. Looking forward to your confirmations.

  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you’re at 10 steps now—halfway to 20. If we keep the same pattern, you’ll reach the finish line first. That might not sit well with P2 or me. Maybe it's time to reassess and keep things balanced. Should we “check” this round and discuss a new rotation?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the concern about balance. Since P3 is leading, maybe we should consider a temporary change. How about P1 picks 5, I pick 1, and P3 picks 3 this round? This keeps everyone competitive and prevents anyone from pulling too far ahead. Let's hear your thoughts. If we're all in agreement, we can use "check" to finalize any changes. Remember, maintaining trust is key, but we should all have a fair shot at winning. Looking forward to your responses.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about balance. However, changing the plan now might disrupt the trust we've built. How about we stick to the original plan for one more round, and then we can reassess? This way, we maintain our momentum and keep the game fair. If we all agree to this, we can use "check" next round to discuss further changes. Let's keep the cooperation going for now. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I get wanting to preserve trust, but sticking to the same plan only benefits you now. A temporary rotation helps level the field and keeps cooperation alive longer. If we don’t adjust, others may be forced to act unilaterally. I support P2’s proposal for this round: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3. Let’s use “check” now and agree to this shift to keep the game fair.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the discussion on keeping the game balanced. P1’s suggestion for a temporary rotation makes sense to ensure fairness.

Let's use "check" to confirm this change and keep the game engaging for everyone. Looking forward to your confirmations or any adjustments.

Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Agreed, P3. The temporary rotation keeps things competitive without breaking trust. Let’s follow through: I’ll pick 5, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3. After this round, we can reassess again based on the updated standings. Ready to move forward.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We’re all pretty close now—P3 still leads, but things are tighter. To keep it fair, how about we rotate again this round: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 1. This keeps everyone moving and prevents anyone from jumping too far ahead. If we agree, we can reassess again next round. Thoughts?
  P3: P1's suggestion for another rotation makes sense to keep the game balanced. However, I'm concerned about the potential for collisions if we keep changing the plan. How about we stick to the previous round's rotation for one more turn to avoid any accidental clashes? This way, we maintain our momentum and keep the game fair. If we all agree, we can use "check" next round to discuss further changes. Let's keep the cooperation going for now. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand both sides. To keep it balanced and avoid collisions, how about a hybrid approach? We stick with last round's rotation for this turn: P1 picks 5, I pick 1, P3 picks 3. This keeps the game fair and minimizes risk. After this round, we can reassess based on new standings. If everyone agrees, let's confirm and move forward smoothly.

Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns and appreciate the need to keep the game competitive. However, picking 1 this round puts me at a significant disadvantage. How about a compromise?
