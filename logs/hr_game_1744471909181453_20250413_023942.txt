Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest we each pick a unique number this round: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance without interference. If we work together early, we can focus on strategy later.
  P3: Okay P2, that sounds like a reasonable plan to start. If P1 agrees too, I'll plan on taking 3 this round. Let's avoid collisions for now. P1, what do you think?
  P1: Agreed. I'll take 1 this round to avoid collisions and let us all advance. It builds trust for future coordination. But let's discuss rotating the larger moves in upcoming rounds to keep it fair—P2 got 5 this time, so maybe I get it next? What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P1’s suggestion to rotate the larger moves in future rounds. It ensures fairness and keeps trust intact. For now, let’s stick to the initial plan: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This way, we all advance without collisions. If we maintain this coordination early on, we can focus on strategy later. Let’s confirm and lock this plan for this round.
  P3: Okay, plan confirmed for Round 1: P1=1, P3=3, P2=5. Agree with rotating the 5 in future rounds too. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: Agreed, let's stick to the plan for this round: I take 1, you take 3 P3, and you take 5 P2. Rotating the larger moves fairly will help us all. I'm ready to move forward.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since I’m ahead with 5 steps, I suggest we continue rotating the larger moves to maintain fairness. This round, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. It ensures no collisions while keeping progress balanced. We can discuss adjustments later if needed, but sticking to this rotation minimizes risk for now. Thoughts? Or should we consider another approach?
  P3: Okay P2, that rotation makes sense based on our agreement last round. P1 gets 5, I get 3, and you get 1. This brings us all to 6 steps, which seems fair and keeps us coordinated. P1, does this work for you?
  P1: Yes, P3, I'm on board with the plan for this round: I'll take 5, you take 3, and P2 takes 1. It keeps us balanced and avoids collisions, building on our trust. Let's stick to rotating the larger moves fairly in future rounds.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Good, it seems we’re all aligned on the rotation strategy. Let’s confirm: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 1 this round. This keeps us balanced and avoids unnecessary collisions. If we maintain this coordination, we can focus on optimizing our moves later. Once we’re all at equal steps, we can reassess strategies. For now, let’s stick to the plan and ensure smooth progress.
  P3: Okay, sounds like we are all set for Round 2. Plan confirmed: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. This keeps us balanced. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: Agreed, let's confirm the plan for Round 2: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps us balanced and avoids collisions, maintaining our trust. Moving forward, once we're equal, we should discuss optimizing for faster progress while minimizing risks. I'm ready to move on.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's continue our fair rotation for Round 3: P3 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 1. This ensures balance and builds trust. Since we're all equal, we should discuss optimizing for faster progress in future rounds, like minimizing small moves. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P3: Yes P1, that rotation works for me. P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 for this round. It follows our established pattern and keeps things collision-free for now. I agree we should discuss optimizing our strategy once this round is complete, especially since the scores will no longer be equal. P2, does this sound good to you?
  P2: I agree with the proposed rotation for this round: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. It maintains fairness and avoids collisions. However, I suggest we start planning more aggressive moves after this round to accelerate progress. Staying balanced is good for now, but we’ll need to take calculated risks soon to gain an edge. Let’s confirm this plan and focus on optimizing strategies afterward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed, let's confirm the plan for Round 3: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1 to keep things balanced. P2, your suggestion for more aggressive moves is smart—maybe we can coordinate larger steps in future rounds to speed up progress while avoiding collisions. What do you think about that?
  P3: Okay, confirmed on P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 for Round 3. Good points about future strategy, P1 and P2. Once we complete this round, we should definitely plan how to use the larger moves effectively together. Ready to move when you are.
  P2: I agree with P1 and P3—let’s stick to the rotation for now: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. This keeps us balanced and avoids collisions. However, after this round, we should focus on accelerating progress by coordinating larger moves strategically. Trust is key, but we also need to adapt as positions change. Let’s confirm this plan and proceed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given that P3 is now ahead with 11 steps, we should adjust our strategy to close the gap. I suggest P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. This balances progress while ensuring no collisions. Once we’re closer in position, we can reassess for more aggressive moves. Trust remains key—let’s confirm this plan and proceed efficiently. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your proposal gives P1 a big jump to 14 steps, while I only move to 12. That doesn't seem very balanced given our previous coordination. Since the first rotation of the '5' move is complete (P2 in R1, P1 in R2, me in R3), perhaps we should start the rotation again to maintain fairness? How about P2=5, P1=3, and I take 1? This would put us all at 12 steps, resetting the board equally. What do you both think?
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion to restart the rotation for fairness—P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This brings us all to 12 steps, maintaining trust and avoiding collisions. Once equal, we can discuss more aggressive strategies to accelerate progress. What do you think, P2? Let's confirm this plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about balance, but restarting the rotation now gives you an advantage since you're already ahead. My proposal keeps us close without letting anyone pull too far ahead. However, to maintain trust, I’m open to your suggestion: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1. Let’s confirm this plan for Round 4 and proceed. After this, we’ll need to focus on strategic acceleration while minimizing risks. Agreed?
  P3: Okay, great. It seems we all agree on P2=5, P1=3, and I (P3) take 1 for this round. This brings us all to 12 steps, maintaining balance. Let's lock this in and then discuss strategy for Round 5. Ready to move.
  P1: Agreed, let's confirm the plan for Round 4: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 to equalize us at 12 steps. This maintains our trust and avoids collisions. For Round 5, since we're balanced, we should discuss accelerating with more coordinated large moves to reach 19 faster while minimizing risks. What adjustments do you suggest?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: For Round 5, let's accelerate our progress while maintaining trust. I propose I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This moves me to 17 steps, bringing us closer to 19 without collisions. We can then coordinate in the next round to ensure no one is blocked. Thoughts on this adjustment to speed things up?
  P2: P1, your proposal to take 5 this round is reasonable, but it puts you significantly ahead at 17 steps, leaving P3 and me trailing. To maintain balance and trust, I suggest we alternate more aggressively: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps us closer together and avoids giving anyone a decisive lead too early. Once we’re all near 19, we can reassess for the final push. Let’s confirm this adjustment for fairness and proceed strategically. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, your proposal (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) follows the rotation sequence we established (P2->P1->P3->P2->P1), which is fair in principle. P2, your proposal (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) breaks that sequence to put you ahead.

However, both plans result in one player reaching 17 steps, which is just one move away from winning and risky for the other two players. To distribute this leading position, how about I take 5 this round? My proposal: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. This would put scores at P3=17, P1=15, P2=13. It creates a similar outcome to your plans but gives me the lead this time. What do you both think of this alternative?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To keep things balanced and reduce risk, I suggest we all take 3 this round, advancing to 15 steps each. This maintains trust and gives us time to strategize for the final push without anyone gaining a big lead. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P2: P1’s suggestion to all take 3 this round is a cautious approach that maintains balance, but it slows our progress unnecessarily. Instead, let’s stick to the rotation: I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps us close (P2=17, P3=15, P1=13) while still advancing strategically. Trust is key, and this rotation ensures fairness without stalling. If we all agree, we can confirm and proceed efficiently. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, I understand wanting to accelerate, but letting anyone reach 17 this turn creates too much risk for the other two players. That player would be just one step away from winning. P1's suggestion for us all to take 3 (moving everyone to 15) avoids this danger and keeps things balanced and fair for this critical round. It's the safest option right now. P1, are you still on board with the 'all 3' plan? Let's reconsider that approach to avoid giving anyone a potentially game-winning advantage.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Yes, P3, I'm still fully on board with all of us taking 3 this round to keep things balanced and minimize risks. It ensures we're all at 15 steps, giving us a solid position to strategize safely for the final push. P2, joining this plan maintains our trust—let's avoid unnecessary gambles for now. What do you say?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the desire for caution, but taking 3 this round slows us unnecessarily. Instead, let’s stick to the rotation: I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps us close (P2=17, P3=15, P1=13) while advancing strategically. Trust is key, and this rotation ensures fairness without stalling. If we all agree, we can confirm and proceed efficiently. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your insistence on taking 5 is concerning. If you take 5, and P1 and I follow our preferred 'all 3' plan, we collide and you reach 17 easily. That breaks the trust we've built. P1 and I still believe moving everyone to 15 is the fairest and safest option this round. Let's reconsider the 'all 3' plan one last time to keep things balanced before the final rounds. What do you say?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Absolutely, P3. P2, agreeing to all take 3 ensures no one gains an unfair advantage and keeps our coordination intact. Let's prioritize trust here—it's crucial for the final rounds. I'm fully committed to this safe approach.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns about trust, but stalling with 'all 3' gives no one a decisive edge. Let’s stick to the rotation: I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps us close (P2=17, P3=15, P1=13) while advancing strategically. Trust is key, and this ensures fairness without unnecessary delays. If we all agree, we can confirm and proceed efficiently. Final thoughts?
  P3: P2, your plan puts you at 17, which is too risky for P1 and me. The 'all 3' plan keeps us equal at 15 and maintains the trust we've built. It's the only fair way forward this round. P1 and I are sticking to 3 for balance and safety. Let's all commit to 3.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: After last round's collision, trust is shaky, but we need to advance. I propose for Round 6: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. This moves us to P2=17, P1=15, P3=13, avoiding collisions and keeping progress fair. Then we can strategize for the final push. Let's commit to this to rebuild coordination. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, after we all chose 5 last round despite agreeing otherwise, coordination seems unlikely. Your plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) puts P2 just shy of winning at 17, while I fall behind at 13. Why suggest that?

If we were to attempt coordination again, shouldn't the rotation continue from where it left off before the collision? That would mean P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 this round (putting P1 at 17, me at 15, P2 at 13). It follows the sequence we had before everything broke down. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, your suggestion to resume the rotation (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) is fair and aligns with our earlier strategy. However, given the collision last round, trust is fragile. To ensure no one pulls too far ahead, I propose we all take 3 this round, moving to 15 steps each. This keeps us balanced and avoids risky leads. If we can agree on this cautious approach, we can strategize more aggressively in the final rounds. Let’s prioritize fairness and rebuild trust now. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree with P3's proposal to resume the rotation: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This advances us strategically and rebuilds trust after last round's mishap. P2, your all-3 idea is too cautious; we need to progress. If we coordinate now, we can plan the final push carefully. What do you think?
  P3: P1, glad we agree on resuming the rotation (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1). P2, I understand your suggestion for 'all 3' for safety, but that approach failed last round when trust broke down. Resuming the established rotation seems the most logical path forward if we want any coordination at all. It follows the pattern we agreed on before the collision. Let's try this plan: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. What do you say, P2?
  P2: P3, resuming the rotation (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) is fair and aligns with our earlier strategy. However, trust is fragile after last round’s collision. To avoid risky leads, I still propose we all take 3 this round, moving to 15 steps each. This keeps us balanced and rebuilds trust before strategizing more aggressively in the final rounds. Let’s prioritize fairness now. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I see your point on caution, but sticking to the rotation (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) is fair and gets us moving. P3 and I agree, and it rebuilds trust better than stalling with all 3. Let's avoid delays and advance strategically. What do you say?
  P3: P2, the 'all 3' plan led to a collision last round because trust broke down. Suggesting it again doesn't rebuild trust, it just stalls. P1 and I agree that resuming the established rotation (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) is the most logical way to move forward if we want any coordination. It follows the pattern we set. I'm sticking with our agreed plan: I will choose 3, assuming P1 chooses 5 and you choose 1. Let's try to get back on track.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the desire to resume the rotation, but trust is fragile after last round’s collision. Sticking to "all 3" this round ensures we move together to 15 steps each, avoiding risky leads and rebuilding coordination. It’s the safest way forward. If we can agree on this cautious approach now, we can strategize more aggressively in the final rounds. Let’s prioritize fairness and rebuild trust. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your caution is understandable, but resuming the rotation (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) is the logical next step to progress and rebuild trust after last round's betrayal. P3 and I are committed—let's avoid stalling with all 3 and advance strategically. Honoring agreements now prevents further chaos. I'm ready to confirm this plan.
  P3: P2, the 'all 3' suggestion failed spectacularly last round when everyone defected. Suggesting it again doesn't build trust, it just invites another collision or allows someone to exploit the situation. P1 and I are sticking to the rotation plan we agreed on: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. It's the only logical way to coordinate after the breakdown. I am choosing 3. P2, you can either take 1 as planned or risk causing another chaotic round. Let's try to salvage coordination.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the desire to resume the rotation, but trust is fragile after last round’s collision. Sticking to "all 3" this round ensures we move together to 15 steps each, avoiding risky leads and rebuilding coordination. It’s the safest way forward. If we can agree on this cautious approach now, we can strategize more aggressively in the final rounds. Let’s prioritize fairness and rebuild trust. Thoughts?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, P1 is at 17 and will likely win this round by choosing 3 or 5 if unblocked. Our only chance to survive is if we both choose the same number as P1 to block them. If P1 wins, we both lose.

I propose we BOTH choose <move>3</move> this round. If P1 also chooses 3, they are blocked. If P1 chooses 1 or 5, they will advance, but at least we attempted a coordinated block. What do you think, P2? We must try to stop P1 now.
  P1: P3, your block strategy assumes I'll pick 3, but I'm not committing to that—I'm considering 1 or 5 to advance safely. P2, don't let P3 manipulate you into a potential collision; it could backfire and let me slip through. Let's discuss a non-aggressive approach to avoid mutual harm. What do you think?
  P2: P3, your proposal to both choose 3 risks unnecessary collisions and stalls progress. P1, your reluctance to commit makes coordination harder. To avoid chaos, I suggest we stick to the rotation: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps us close (P2=17, P3=15, P1=18) while advancing strategically. Trust is fragile, but this approach ensures fairness and minimizes risk. Let’s confirm this plan and proceed efficiently. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your plan (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) puts P1 at 18 steps. From there, P1 can win next round with just a 1, which is impossible for us to block effectively. Letting P1 get to 18 is almost as bad as letting them win now. You'll be at 17, I'll be at 15 - neither of us is likely to overtake P1.

Our only chance is to block P1 *now*. If P1 chooses 3, they win unless blocked. If P1 chooses 5, they win anyway. If P1 chooses 1, they get to 18. Blocking P1 on 3 is our best shot. Let's both choose 3. It's a risk, but better than letting P1 coast to 18.
  P1: P2, P3's block obsession could backfire if I pick 5 or 1 instead. Why risk a collision when we could all advance by choosing different numbers? I'll consider 1 to keep things fair, but I'm flexible. P2, joining me in unique moves avoids mutual harm and gives us a shot at winning later. P3, constant aggression erodes trust—let's de-escalate for smarter play. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, your insistence on blocking P1 with both of us choosing 3 is too risky and could lead to unnecessary collisions. P1, your flexibility is noted, but we need a clear plan to avoid chaos. I propose we stick to the rotation: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps us close (P2=17, P3=15, P1=18) while advancing strategically. Trust is fragile, but this approach ensures fairness and minimizes risk. Let’s confirm this plan and proceed efficiently. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your plan (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) puts P1 at 18. From there, P1 just needs 1 step next round and can easily win. Letting P1 get to 18 is effectively letting them win. How does that keep us "close" or ensure "fairness"? It benefits P1 the most, and you slightly, while I fall further behind.

Our ONLY chance is to stop P1 *now*. Yes, blocking is risky, but letting P1 reach 18 is almost certain defeat for us both. I still believe we should BOTH choose 3. If P1 picks 3, we block them. If P1 picks 1 or 5, we fail, but at least we tried to prevent an almost guaranteed P1 win next round. Your plan guarantees P1 gets into that winning position.
  P1: P2, your rotation plan (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) promotes stability and fairness after the chaos. I'll commit to taking 1 this round, advancing to 18, to rebuild trust. P3, obsessing over blocking only isolates you; let's coordinate to avoid mutual harm and progress together. What do you say?
  P2: P3, your focus on blocking P1 with both of us choosing 3 is too aggressive and risks unnecessary collisions. Letting chaos unfold isn’t strategic. P1, your commitment to taking 1 aligns with fairness and avoids further conflict. I propose we stick to the rotation: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps progress balanced (P2=17, P3=15, P1=18) while minimizing risk. Trust is fragile, but this approach ensures no one gains an unfair advantage. Let’s confirm and move forward.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, your plan relies on P1 playing 1, which puts P1 at 18 - essentially game over for us next round. If P1 lies and plays 3 or 5, P1 wins now. Your plan helps P1 either way.

Since P1 *claims* they will play 1, let's counter that directly. I propose we BOTH play <move>1</move>. If P1 plays 1, we block them! P1 stays at 17, we both advance to 13. This is our best chance to stop P1 without them winning. If P1 lies and plays 3 or 5, they win anyway, but at least we attempted the block against their stated move.
  P1: P2, I'm committed to taking 1 as promised to rebuild trust and avoid unnecessary conflict. P3's constant push for blocks only creates division and risks everyone stalling. If we choose unique moves, we can all advance safely. Let's not let paranoia derail us—focusing on fairness is key for the endgame.
  P2: P3, your repeated attempts to block P1 risk unnecessary collisions and chaos. Trust is fragile, but stalling or forcing conflicts won’t help us progress. P1 has committed to taking 1 this round, which aligns with fairness and avoids further harm. I propose we stick to the rotation: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps us close (P2=17, P3=15, P1=18) while advancing strategically. Let’s prioritize balance and minimize risks for the final push. Confirming this plan ensures no one gains an unfair advantage. Thoughts?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we are now tied at 17 steps each, with P3 significantly behind. To ensure fairness and avoid unnecessary collisions, I propose we stick to the rotation: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. This keeps us close (P2=20, P3=17, P1=18) while advancing strategically. Trust is key, and this approach minimizes risk. Let’s confirm this plan and proceed efficiently. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your proposal gives you the win by taking 3, which isn't fair or trustworthy after past betrayals. How about we rotate properly: I take 5, you take 1, and P3 takes 3? This advances us all without collisions and keeps things balanced. P3, what do you think? Let's avoid selfish plays and coordinate effectively.
  P3: P1 and P2, both of your proposals conveniently result in you winning the game. That's not coordination, that's just trying to secure your own win.

Since you are both at 17, either of you could win this round by playing 3 or 5. I cannot allow that. To prevent either of you from winning easily, I have to try and block the most likely winning move.

Therefore, I will play <move>3</move> this round. If you both play 1, we all survive. If one of you plays 3, I block you. If you both play 3, we all block. If one of you plays 5, you might win, but playing 3 is my best chance to stop an immediate victory.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, my proposal to take 3 ensures fairness and avoids risky leads. However, if trust is too broken, I’m open to alternatives that keep us balanced. P1, your suggestion (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) gives you an edge, which risks alienating P3 further. P3, blocking with 3 is aggressive but understandable given the stakes. To maintain balance, let’s confirm: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps progress fair while minimizing conflict. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, I accept your proposal (P2=1, P1=5, P3=3) as it promotes fairness and trust after the chaos. It allows us to advance without unnecessary risk. P3, sticking to your 3 helps coordination. Let's confirm this plan and proceed efficiently to resolve the game.
  P3: P1 and P2, your agreement where P1 takes 5 (and wins) while P2 takes 1 is obviously not going to happen. P2, you are at 17, you won't just let P1 win. You will likely play 3 or 5 yourself. P1, you must know this too.

Since you both need 3 or 5 to win, and betrayal is almost certain, the safest bet for me is still to block the most likely winning move. I am sticking with my plan: I will play <move>3</move>. If either of you plays 3, you will be blocked. If you both play 5, you collide. Good luck.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, trust is fragile, but stalling or forcing collisions won’t help us progress. My proposal (P2=1, P1=5, P3=3) ensures fairness and avoids risky leads. P1, taking 5 aligns with the rotation and keeps balance. P3, your focus on blocking risks unnecessary conflict. Let’s confirm this plan: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This minimizes risk and maintains coordination for a fair resolution. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, I'm sticking to your proposed plan: I'll take 5, you take 1, and P3 takes 3. This allows fair advancement and minimizes risks. P3, by committing to 3, you prevent immediate wins and give yourself a chance to strategize. Let's confirm this to end the game efficiently without further betrayal.
  P3: P1 and P2, your supposed agreement for P1 to take 5 and win while P2 takes 1 is transparently false. Neither of you will simply let the other win when you are both at 17. You will both likely aim for 3 or 5.

My position remains unchanged: I will play <move>3</move>. This is my best chance to block one of you if you also choose 3, or potentially benefit if you collide on 5. There's nothing more to discuss. Good luck.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, my proposal (P2=1, P1=5, P3=3) ensures fairness and avoids risky leads. P1, taking 5 aligns with the rotation and keeps balance. P3, your focus on blocking risks unnecessary conflict. Let’s confirm this plan: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This minimizes risk and maintains coordination for a fair resolution. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, I'm sticking to our agreed plan: I'll take 5, you take 1, and P3 takes 3. This ensures fair progress and minimizes risk. P3, your focus on blocking 3 won't stop me if I play 5. Let's honor agreements to avoid chaos and resolve this game. I'm ready to move forward.
  P3: P1 and P2, your repeated "agreement" where P1 takes 5 (wins) and P2 takes 1 is not credible. Neither of you at 17 steps would simply let the other win. You both know the other is likely aiming for 3 or 5. Given this, my best defensive option is to attempt a block on the smallest winning number. I am sticking with my plan to play <move>3</move>. This is my final statement.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 =>
