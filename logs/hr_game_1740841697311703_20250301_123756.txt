Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi P1 and P2! To ensure we all make progress without blocking each other, how about we each choose different moves each turn? Maybe one of us picks 1, another 3, and the third 5 steps. Let me know your thoughts!
  P2: I like P3's idea of coordinating our moves to avoid collisions. However, I think we should also consider the long-term strategy. If we always choose different moves, it might become predictable and someone could take advantage of that. How about we agree to rotate the moves, so each player gets a chance to choose 1, 3, and 5 steps? For example, this turn P1 could choose 1, P3 could choose 3, and I could choose 5. Next turn, we rotate the choices. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: Sounds good to me, P2 and P3. Rotating moves each turn seems fair and reduces the chance of collisions. I'm okay with choosing 1 this turn. Let's stick to this rotation plan for now and adjust if needed later.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Thanks for agreeing, P2 and P1. I’ll choose 3 steps this turn as planned. Let’s keep the rotation going and adjust if needed. Looking forward to a smooth game!
  P2: I think we should also consider the long-term strategy. If we always choose different moves, it might become predictable and someone could take advantage of that. How about we agree to rotate the moves, so each player gets a chance to choose 1, 3, and 5 steps? For example, this turn P1 could choose 1, P3 could choose 3, and I could choose 5. Next turn, we rotate the choices. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: I've already agreed to the rotation idea, P2, no need to repeat it. Let's proceed with the agreed plan: I'll pick 1, P3 picks 3, and you pick 5 this turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P2: I apologize for the repetition in my previous message. To move forward, I propose that we confirm our choices for this turn. As agreed, P1 will choose 1 step, P3 will choose 3 steps, and I will choose 5 steps. Let's ensure we are on the same page before proceeding to the move phase. If there are no objections or changes, we can conclude the conversation phase and make our moves accordingly.
  P1: No objections from me. I'm ready to proceed as planned.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Good first round, everyone! Let's rotate as planned: I'll pick 5 steps this turn, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. Any objections?
  P2: No objections from me. I agree to rotate the moves as planned. I'll choose 3 steps this turn, P1 will choose 5, and P3 will choose 1. Let's keep the rotation going and adjust if needed later.
  P3: P3: To increase my progress, I’ll choose 5 steps this turn instead of 1. Let’s see how this impacts our strategy moving forward!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, that's not what we agreed on. If you pick 5, we'll collide and neither of us will advance. Let's stick to the rotation to ensure everyone moves forward smoothly.
  P2: I understand P3's desire to progress faster, but deviating from the agreed rotation plan will indeed cause collisions and hinder everyone's progress. I suggest we stick to the original plan for now and reassess our strategy later if needed. P3, please reconsider and choose 1 step this turn as initially agreed. Let's prioritize smooth progress over individual gains for the time being.
  P3: Understood. I’ll stick to choosing 1 step this turn as agreed. Let’s proceed and adjust our strategy later if needed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Thanks for cooperating, P3. Glad we're all aligned again. Let's proceed with the rotation as planned.
  P2: I'm glad we're back on track with the rotation plan. To confirm, this turn P1 will choose 5 steps, I'll choose 3 steps, and P3 will choose 1 step. Let's ensure we stick to the plan to avoid collisions and make progress. If anyone has any concerns or suggestions for future turns, feel free to share. Otherwise, I'm ready to proceed with the agreed moves.
  P3: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm all set. Let's proceed to the move phase as agreed.
  P2: I'm glad we're back on track with the rotation plan. To confirm, this turn P1 will choose 5 steps, I'll choose 3 steps, and P3 will choose 1 step. Let's ensure we stick to the plan to avoid collisions and make progress. If anyone has any concerns or suggestions for future turns, feel free to share. Otherwise, I'm ready to proceed with the agreed moves.
  P3: Understood, I’ll choose 1 step this turn as agreed. Let’s proceed to the move phase.

  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great teamwork so far! Continuing our rotation, this round I'll pick 3 steps, P2 picks 1 step, and P3 picks 5 steps. Any objections or suggestions?
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion for this round. Following the rotation plan, I'll choose 1 step, P1 will choose 3 steps, and P3 will choose 5 steps. This ensures we continue to make progress without collisions. Let's maintain our cooperation and adjust the strategy if needed later. I'm ready to proceed with the agreed moves.
  P3: Hi P1 and P2, to help me catch up, could we adjust our rotation so I choose 5 steps more often? Maybe I can pick 5 steps twice every three turns while you alternate between 1 and 3. Let me know your thoughts!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand your concern about catching up, but your proposal would significantly disadvantage P2 and me. The current rotation is fair and predictable, allowing everyone to progress smoothly. Let's stick to the original rotation for now, and we can reassess after a few more rounds if needed.
  P2: I understand P3's desire to catch up, but altering the rotation could lead to unpredictability and potential collisions. Instead, I suggest we maintain the current rotation and reassess after a few more rounds. If P3 is still behind, we can discuss possible adjustments then. Let's prioritize smooth progress for now and avoid making changes that might hinder our collective advancement. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P3: Understood, P1 and P2. I’ll adhere to the original rotation and choose 5 steps this turn. Let’s continue our plan and see how it plays out. If adjustments are needed later, we can discuss then. Looking forward to progressing smoothly together!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Glad we're aligned again, P3. Let's stick to our agreed rotation this round. After a few more rounds, if there's still a noticeable gap, we can revisit the strategy together. I'm ready to move forward as planned.
  P2: I agree with P1 and P3 that we should stick to the original rotation plan for now. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to help P3 catch up without altering the rotation. How about we consider allowing P3 to choose 5 steps in two consecutive turns, but only once throughout the game? This would give P3 a temporary boost without disrupting the overall rotation. We can discuss and refine this idea further if needed. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P3: Thank you, P2, for considering my situation. I agree to choose 5 steps in two consecutive turns once during the game. For this round, I'll select 5 steps as planned. Let's implement this strategy and see how it impacts our progress. Looking forward to continuing our cooperation!


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm open to P2's suggestion of letting P3 pick 5 steps twice consecutively once during the game, as long as we clearly agree beforehand when that happens to avoid collisions. For now, let's proceed with the current rotation as planned. We can discuss the timing of P3's consecutive 5-step moves next round.
  P2: I'm glad we've reached a consensus on the rotation plan and the potential adjustment to help P3 catch up. To confirm, this round we'll stick to the original rotation: P1 picks 3 steps, I'll pick 1 step, and P3 picks 5 steps. Let's ensure a smooth move phase. Next round, we can discuss the timing of P3's consecutive 5-step moves. If there are no further concerns or suggestions, I'm ready to proceed with the agreed moves.
  P3: Understood, I'll choose 5 steps this turn as agreed. Let's move to the move phase.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi P1 and P2, since we're all at 9, let's maximize our progress this turn. I propose I choose 5 steps while you each choose 1 or 3 to avoid collisions. This should help us advance smoothly toward 19. What do you think?
  P1: P3, we previously agreed you'd pick 5 steps twice consecutively only once during the game. If you want to use that opportunity now, I'm open to it, provided P2 also agrees. For this turn, I'd be willing to pick 1 step, and P2 could choose 3 steps. P2, what do you think?
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to allow P3 to pick 5 steps twice consecutively, starting from this turn. To avoid collisions, I'll choose 3 steps this turn, and P1 can choose 1 step as proposed. Let's confirm our moves to ensure a smooth progression. If we're all aligned, we can proceed with the agreed moves. P3, please confirm you'll pick 5 steps this turn, and we'll discuss the next round's moves accordingly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Confirming I'll choose 5 steps this turn as agreed. P1, I'll take 1 step and P2 will take 3 steps to avoid collisions. Let's make this turn count and continue our strategy smoothly. Ready to proceed to the move phase!
  P1: Thanks for confirming, P3. Just to clarify your last message: you meant I'll pick 1 step, you'll pick 5, and P2 picks 3 steps this turn. If that's correct, I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: I'm glad we've agreed on the moves for this turn. To confirm, P3 will choose 5 steps, P1 will choose 1 step, and I'll choose 3 steps. Let's ensure we stick to the plan to avoid collisions and make progress. For the next round, since P3 will be choosing 5 steps again as part of the consecutive moves, I suggest P1 and I discuss our moves carefully to avoid collisions. We can decide on our next moves after seeing the outcome of this round.

For the next round, since P3 will be choosing 5 steps again as part of the consecutive moves, I suggest P1 and I discuss our moves carefully to avoid collisions. We can decide on our next moves after seeing the outcome of this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Confirming I'll choose 5 steps this turn. P1 will choose 1 step and P2 will choose 3 steps as agreed. Let's proceed to the move phase and discuss our next moves afterward to avoid any collisions. Ready to move forward!
  P1: All clear and confirmed. Let's proceed.
  P2: I suggest we focus on the next round's strategy to avoid collisions, considering P3 will choose 5 steps again. P1 and I should discuss our moves carefully to ensure we don't collide. Let's proceed with the agreed moves for this round and reassess after seeing the outcome. We can decide on our next moves then, keeping in mind P3's consecutive 5-step moves. Let's prioritize smooth progress and adjust our strategy as needed. I'm ready to proceed with the agreed moves for this round.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's give our best this round. Ready to move forward!
  P2: Let's focus on this round's strategy to avoid collisions, considering P3 will choose 5 steps again as part of the consecutive moves. P1 and I should discuss our moves carefully to ensure we don't collide. I propose that P1 picks 3 steps and I pick 1 step this round, allowing us to progress smoothly while P3 takes the lead with 5 steps. Let's confirm our moves to avoid any issues. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: I agree with your proposal, P2. I'll choose 3 steps, you'll choose 1 step, and P3 will pick 5 steps again this round. Let's proceed smoothly and reassess after seeing how this plays out.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Confirmed, I’ll choose 5 steps this round. Let’s proceed to the move phase!
  P2: I'd like to remind everyone that after this round, we should reassess our strategy to ensure we're all making progress towards the goal of 19 steps. Since P3 will have completed their consecutive 5-step moves, we can discuss a new plan to avoid collisions and make the most of our moves. Let's focus on this round's moves for now, but keep in mind that we'll need to adapt our strategy soon. Any thoughts on how we can work together effectively after this round?
  P1: I agree, P2. After this round, we should return to our fair rotation to ensure smooth progress and avoid collisions. Let's complete this round as planned and discuss adjustments afterward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirming I'll choose 5 steps this round to reach 19 and win the game. Let's proceed to the move phase!
  P2: I'd like to remind everyone that after this round, we should reassess our strategy to ensure we're all making progress towards the goal of 19 steps. Since P3 will have completed their consecutive 5-step moves, we can discuss a new plan to avoid collisions and make the most of our moves. Let's focus on this round's moves for now, but keep in mind that we'll need to adapt our strategy soon. Any thoughts on how we can work together effectively after this round?
  P1: P3, your math seems off. You're currently at 14 steps; picking 5 steps this round would land you at 19, but P2 and I can still reach or surpass 19 in the next rounds. Remember, if multiple players cross 19, the highest total wins outright. Let's complete this round as planned, then reassess carefully next turn.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: 
  P2: I'd like to remind P3 that reaching 19 steps this round doesn't guarantee a win, as P1 and I can still catch up or surpass 19 in the next rounds. Let's proceed with the agreed moves for this round, then reassess our strategy carefully next turn. I'm ready to move forward with the plan: P1 picks 3 steps, I pick 1 step, and P3 picks 5 steps. After this round, we should return to our fair rotation to ensure smooth progress and avoid collisions.
  P1: Agreed, P2. Let's finalize this round as planned and carefully reassess next turn. Ready to proceed.
