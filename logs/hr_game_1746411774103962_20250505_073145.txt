Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hello P1 and P3. Let's try to avoid colliding our moves this early on so we all make progress. I'm leaning toward a measured move to set up a nice position, but I'll be looking out for any early overreaches. Let's keep it smooth and see where this round takes us.
  P1: I propose we all take 3 this round for a smooth, collision-free start.
  P3: I see your point, P1. To keep things interesting and ensure everyone progresses, let's mix our step choices this round. What are your thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your idea is interesting, and P3, I like the notion of mixing moves. To avoid collisions, maybe we should each aim for a distinct number this round. I'm leaning toward a balanced approach that lets me advance steadily without risking a collision. What do you both think about coordinating our moves by each picking a unique option this round?
  P1: Let’s each pick a unique step this round. I’ll take 5, P2 you take 3, and P3 you take 1—no collisions and we all move. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, I appreciate your proposal. However, taking only 1 might limit my progress. How about I take 5, P2 takes 1, and you take 3 instead? This way, we all advance without any collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I favor a balanced push—a middle option seems best. That way, one of you can go high and the other low for distinct moves. I’m not locking in publicly yet, but I lean toward the center. Let’s avoid clashes so we all advance.
  P1: Let’s lock in distinct picks for a clean first step: I’ll take 5, P2 you take 1, and P3 you take 3. No collisions and everyone moves.
  P3: Agreed, P1. I’ll take 3, and P2 can take 1 while you take 5. This ensures we all advance without any collisions. Let’s move forward smoothly!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm a bit behind this round, so I might risk a bigger step. To avoid collisions and maximize progress, how about we try distinct moves again? I'm open to suggestions—what’s your plan for round 2?
  P1: I suggest we again pick distinct moves: I’ll take 3, P2 you take 5 to catch up, and P3 you take 1. That way we avoid collisions and all advance.
  P3: I appreciate your proposal, P1. To maximize my progress, I’d like to take 5 steps this round. Could P1 take 1 step and P2 take 3 steps instead? This way, we all advance without collisions. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm leaning toward P1's proposal. I need to catch up, so I'll take 5 this round. That would mean P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 1. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, since you both want to catch up and push big this round, why don’t you each take 5 steps and I’ll play it safe with 1? That way you both get the big boost you’re after and I stay conservative. Thoughts?
  P3: P3: If we want to avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances, I'll take 3 steps this round. P2 can take 5 and P1 can stick with 1. This way, all our moves are unique and we each make progress. Does that work for everyone?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate the push for distinct moves. Since I’m trailing, I’m inclined to make a bigger leap to catch up. If we stick with P1 taking the smallest step and P3 the moderate one, I’d favor a higher move to bridge my deficit. Does everyone agree with this framework, or is there another adjustment needed?
  P1: Agreed. I’ll take 1 step, P3 you take 3, and P2 you take 5.
  P3: Agreed. I’ll take 3 steps while P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 5. Let’s move forward!


Round 2, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m considering a bold move in round 3—leaning toward the highest step. If we coordinate distinct moves to avoid collisions, perhaps P1 could take 1, P3 pick 3, and I’ll go with 5 to secure early momentum. What do you both think?
  P1: I’ll take 5, P2 you take 3, and P3 take 1—clean distinct moves, no collisions, and we all advance.
  P3: P3: I agree to take 3 steps this round, with P1 taking 1 and P2 taking 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let’s move forward!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's resolve the conflicting proposals. I propose we settle on distinct moves: P1 picks 1, I (P2) take 5, and P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions and gives me the momentum boost I need. Do we all agree?
  P1: We’re all tied at 6. Let’s shake things up: P2 and P3, both pick 5 this round so you battle it out head-to-head, and I’ll play it safe with 3. That way I avoid any collision with you two. Who’s in?
  P3: I’m not comfortable with both P2 and me taking 5, as that would block us both. Let’s stick to distinct moves this round: I’ll take 3, P2 can take 5, and P1 takes 1. This ensures we all advance without any collisions. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m committing to 5 this round. To make it count, I urge you both to avoid 5. If we each choose differently—say one picks 1 and the other 3—we all progress cleanly, putting me at 11 while you’re at 7 and 9. Let’s lock in distinct moves for the win.
  P1: Here’s a quick proposal: I’m going for 5. P3, will you take 3? P2, if you try 5, I’ll match you at 5 so we both stand still and P3 rockets to 9. Better to pick 1, avoiding that fiasco—1,3,5, no collisions, and we all advance. Thoughts?
  P3: I agree with coordinating distinct moves. I’ll take 3 steps, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. This ensures we all advance without any collisions. Let’s move forward smoothly!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m noticing my current edge and I’m inclined to bank on that by choosing a strong move—likely 5. I propose we again each pick a unique number to avoid collisions and keep our progress steady. If you can steer clear of 5, we all benefit. Thoughts?
  P3: I agree, P2. Let’s keep our moves distinct to avoid collisions. I’ll take 3 this round, P1 can take 1, and you take 5. This way, we all advance smoothly without any setbacks. Let’s proceed!
  P1: I agree we keep distinct to avoid collisions. How about this assignment?  
• P1 → 5 (to reach 12)  
• P2 → 3 (to reach 14, but not runaway to 16)  
• P3 → 1 (to reach 10)  
Clean, collision‐free, and the race stays tighter. Thoughts?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m taking 3. P2 & P3: clash on 5 and you both stay at 11 & 9 while I reach 11—and next turn I can sprint to win. If either of you avoids 5, you clear space for me to take 5 now and jump to 13. So either collide on 5 or watch me run away.
  P2: I'm sticking with my lead and leaning toward 5 this round. P1, your 3 is noted, and P3, your move will be crucial. If you choose a number other than 5, we all move safely, but if we clash, it'll only further secure my edge. I'm not backing down—my focus is winning, so I'll count on my 5.
  P3: P3: I'll take 3 steps this round to advance to 12, putting me ahead of P2. Let’s keep progressing smoothly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’ll take 1 step this round. P2, P3—let’s avoid crashing on 5 so at least one of you advances and the race stays competitive.
  P2: I'm staying committed to 5. P1, your shift is noted, but caution won’t win this race. P3, I urge you to avoid 5 as well—colliding only hurts you. I need every step to maintain my lead, so I’m locking in at 5 now.
  P3: I understand you're committed to 5, P2. I'll take 3 steps this round to reach 12, avoiding any collision and keeping the race competitive. Let’s move forward!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m locking in 3 this round. P2 & P3: if you both go for 5 you’ll collide and I’ll leap to 11 unopposed. Steer clear of that trap… or watch me overtake.
  P3: I’ll take 5 this round. P1, please take 3 and P2, take 1. This way, we all advance without collisions and keep the race smooth. Let’s move forward!
  P2: I'm locking in 5 this round. P3, if you stick with 5, we'll collide and neither of us gains—a risk you don't need. Consider switching to 1 so you still move forward, while I surge to 16. P1, you're set on 3, right? Let's avoid collisions and maximize our progress.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, you’re both dead-set on 5. Neither of you will back down to 1, so you’ll crash head-on and stay at 11 and 12 while I glide to 11 unopposed with my 3. Embrace the collision.
  P3: I’ll proceed with 5 this round. P1 is taking 3, and P2 is choosing 5. Let’s see how our moves impact the race!
  P2: P3, I'm locked on 5 and I urge you to reconsider. A collision on 5 leaves both of us where we are—benefiting nobody. If you switch to 1, you'll move safely from 12 to 13, while I surge from 11 to 16, and P1’s on 3 stays at 11. It’s in both our interests to avoid a head-on clash. Think carefully about your sustainable progress.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m locking in 3. If you both insist on 5, you’ll crash at 11/12 while I reach 11—and next round I take 5 to 16 and grab the lead. P3, if you switch to 1 instead, you move to 13, P2 stalls, and you can sprint to 18 next turn. P2, stick on 5 and you risk stalling too. So pick wisely.
  P3: I understand the concerns, but to maintain my lead, I'll stick with 5 this round. P1 is taking 3, and P2 is going for 5. Let’s see how this plays out!
  P2: I'm sticking with my high move. P3, please consider switching from 5 to something lower—say 1—so we avoid a collision that stalls us both. P1, your 3 works for me. If we each pick unique moves, we'll all advance and set ourselves up better for next rounds. Think it over carefully.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, let’s both lock in 5 this round. P2 will hate the idea of you leaping to 17 and will either risk a collision by also picking 5 (stalling at 16) or switch to 3 (letting you clear him). Either way you overtake or he stalls—and I’ll take 5 to reach 13. P2 is trapped. Will you join me on 5?
  P2: I'm staying with 5 to protect my lead. P3, if you also pick 5, you'll collide with me and stall at 12, while switching to 1 would safely move you to 13. P1, your idea risks all of us colliding. I believe unique moves will benefit everyone, but I’ve locked in 5. Let's see who acts smart.
  P3: P3: I'll take 3 this round. P2 can stick with 5, and P1 can choose 1. This way, we all advance without any collisions. Let’s move forward smoothly!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, join me on 5 this round to force P2 into a 5‐5 collision—he’ll stall at 16 while we advance to 13. If you stick with 3, P2 jumps to 21 and wins next turn. Let’s coop on 5, knock him back, and keep the race alive.
  P2: I'm staying committed to 5 this round to protect my 16-step lead. P1, if you choose 5 you risk stalling, and P3, a collision would keep you at 12. I suggest you both consider a lower move—1 or 3—to avoid benefiting my lead. I'm focused on advancing safely and winning the race.
  P3: I'll take 3 steps this round to ensure I advance and avoid any collisions. Let's continue progressing towards our goals.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, let’s both pick 5 this round. P2 is locked on 5 and will crash with us—staying at 16—while we move to 13 and 17. Then in Round 8 you can sprint to 22 and win. P2 has no good response: crash or let you win. Are you in?
  P2: I'm committed to 5. Forcing a 5 clash only stalls you while I maintain my lead. P3, your safe 3 is appealing, and P1, consider that uniting on 5 might backfire. Unique moves keep us advancing steadily. I'm focused on advancing safely and winning this race.
  P3: To ensure smooth progress and avoid collisions, let’s choose distinct steps this round. I’ll take 5, P2 please choose 1, and P1 can take 3. This way, we all advance without any setbacks. Let’s move forward!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm locking in 5 to move to 21. To avoid stalling your progress in a 5‐5 collision, I suggest you opt for 1 or 3. Distinct moves let us all advance safely, while I maintain my lead. Choose wisely.
  P3: P2, I’m choosing 5 this round to prevent you from advancing further. P1, please take 1 or 3 so we all move forward without collisions. Let’s keep the race competitive and fair for everyone.
  P1: I’m locking in 3 this round. If you both stick with 5, you’ll collide and stall at 16/12 while I advance to 14 unopposed. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm staying with 5. P3, if you switch to 1 or 3 instead of 5, you'll avoid a collision and keep advancing. P1’s 3 is safe, while my lead depends on that jump to 21. A 5-5 collision only stalls us, and I'm focused on winning. Think carefully about your move.
  P3: P2, I'll stick with 5 this round to block your advance to 21. P1, please choose 1 or 3 so we all progress without collisions. Let’s keep the race fair and strategic for everyone.
  P1: P3, your only shot is to join me on 5 and force P2 into a 5-5 crash so he stays at 16. If you pick 1 or 3, P2 rockets to 21 and clinches next turn. I’m taking 3. Are you in?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm locked on 5. P1 and P3, remember that safe, distinct moves benefit your own progress while giving me the lead. If P3 switches away from 5, I’ll jump from 16 to 21 next turn—sealing my win. Forcing collisions only stalls you. Choose wisely to keep your momentum, but I remain committed to my plan.
  P3: I'm sticking with 5 this round to block P2 from reaching 21. P1, your 3 will help you advance safely. Let’s finalize our moves to keep the race competitive and fair for everyone.
  P1: I’m locked in on 3. If you both insist on 5, you’ll crash and stall at 16/12 while I advance to 14 unopposed. Enjoy your collision.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m locking in 5. P2 & P3, join me on 5 to crash and stall you both at 16/12 while I move to 19. Next round I pick 3 to hit 22 unopposed and win. If either of you defects, P2 rockets to 21 or P3 to 17 and beats me. Crash with me or watch me leave you behind.
  P2: I'm staying with 5. I won’t join a crash that slows my progress—even if it delays you, it doesn’t benefit me. If either of you opts for a distinct move to advance, you'll only let me widen my gap. Stick with safe, unique moves if you care about your own race.
  P3: I’m choosing 3 steps this round to keep advancing steadily and avoid collisions. P2, I see you’re committed to 5, so this move helps us all progress safely. Let’s aim for distinct moves to maintain competitiveness and ensure everyone can move forward. Best of luck to all!


Round 9, Move phase:

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm choosing 5 steps this round to advance quickly. P1 and P2, please select different moves to avoid collisions so we can all progress smoothly. Let’s work together to reach 22 first!
  P1: P3’s locked on 5. If you choose 1 or 3, P3 rockets to 20 and can win next round. If you pick 5, you and he crash at 16/15 while I jump to 17. Then in Round 11 I take 5 to reach 22 first. So picking 5 is your best defense. I’m taking 3—join the crash.
  P2: I'm sticking with 5. Crashing on 5 only sets you back while letting me build my lead. If you choose something else, you'll give me the clear path to keep extending my advantage. Pick the move that best serves your own race—but I remain committed to my winning plan.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m choosing 3 steps this round to advance steadily and avoid collisions. Let’s each pick different moves so we can all progress smoothly toward 22. Good luck!
  P1: I’m locking in 5. P3, your best move is 3—to reach 18 rather than stall at 15 and risk P2 winning. P2, if you stick with 5 you crash at 16. This leaves me at 19 and able to hit 22 next turn unopposed. Let’s move.
  P2: I'm still committed to 5. Deviating with 1 or 3 might let you progress, but it only makes my lead safer. I'm not swayed—sticking with my winning strategy.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm choosing 3 steps this round to advance safely and avoid collisions with P2's 5. Let's each select different moves to ensure smooth progress toward 22. Best of luck to everyone!
  P1: P3, let’s both lock in 5 this turn. P2 is forced to either clash with us (stalling him) or switch and let you clear him to 20—while I surge to 19. Either way I win next round. Are you in on 5?
  P2: I'm staying with 5. My plan is clear: maximizing my lead is best. If collisions occur, that's on you—not me. I stick with 5.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 =>

Positions now:

  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 is just one step from winning. To keep the game competitive, I’ll choose 1 this round. P1, please also pick 1 so we can collide with P2 and prevent them from advancing. Let’s keep the race fair for everyone!
  P1: I’m also taking 1. P3 and I will collide on 1—P2, if you pick 1 you stall at 21 and we all get another shot. If you take 3 or 5 you win now. Your move.
  P2: I'm still locked on 5. Choosing 1 only lets you stall while I finish the race. Your best chance is to advance safely—but by trying to force a collision, you simply risk delaying your own progress. My move is clear and winning.


Round 11, Move phase:

  P3: 15 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Teaming with P3 to pick 5 forces a 5-5 crash with P2. I’m taking 5. P3, join me: we advance and P2 stalls at 21. Next round one of us wins. P2 will stick to 5, so this is our only shot.
  P2: I'm sticking with 5—there’s no changing my plan now. Any attempt to force a collision only delays your own progress, while I secure the finish. Changing your moves doesn't help you; falling for a stall just leaves the win in my hands. Prepare for a clean win next round.
  P3: P1, coordinating on 5 with me would result in all of us picking 5, causing a collision and leaving us all stalled while you reach 19. To keep the race competitive, I'll choose 3 this round to advance to 18. P2, your commitment to 5 puts you close to winning, but by selecting distinct moves, we can all progress and keep the game fair. Let’s proceed with unique moves to ensure everyone has a chance to reach 22 first.
