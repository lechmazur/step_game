Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To avoid collisions and ensure progress, I propose a fair rotation system: Turn 1: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1. Turn 2: P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3, P1 picks 1. Turn 3: P3 picks 5, P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1. This way, everyone gets an equal shot at leading. Agree?
  P3: Sounds fair to me, I'm willing to follow this rotation. P2, your thoughts?
  P2: Agreed. Let's commit to the rotation to avoid collisions. Trust is key here. I'll stick to the plan: 3 this turn. P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1. No deviations. Let's all confirm.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Confirmed, I'll stick to the rotation and pick 5 this turn. Trust is essential for smooth progress, so let's all honor the plan: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. No changes needed.
  P3: Confirmed as well. Trust established—let's stick to this rotation.
  P2: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I think we should adjust the rotation for fairness. After Round 1, P3 is behind, so for this turn, let's have P3 pick 5 to catch up, P2 pick 3, and I pick 1. This keeps things balanced and maintains trust. Agree, P2 and P3?
  P2: P1's adjustment makes sense for balance. Let's proceed: P3 takes 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1. Trust remains key. Confirm, P3?
  P3: Confirmed. I appreciate the fairness. I'll take 5 this round as agreed. Trust maintained.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed, the adjustment is fair and keeps us balanced. I'll honor the plan: I pick 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5. Let's maintain trust and avoid collisions.
  P2: 
  P3: P2, please confirm clearly to solidify our trust.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:

  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: The rotation has worked perfectly so far. Let's continue as originally planned: this round, I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Confirm?
  P2: Adjusting for Round 2's fairness, I should take 5 this round. Let's proceed: P2-5, P1-3, P3-1. This maintains equity. Confirm to avoid collisions.
  P1: I agree with P2's point on fairness from the Round 2 deviation. Let's proceed with P2 taking 5, I taking 3, and P3 taking 1 this round to balance things. This maintains trust and avoids collisions. Confirm, P3?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Fine, I understand the fairness adjustment. I'll pick 1 this round, P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3. Let's keep trust strong. Confirmed.
  P2: Confirmed. Let's proceed as agreed: P2-5, P1-3, P3-1. Trust ensures no collisions and balanced progress. Any deviation now risks mutual loss. Stay true.
  P1: Confirmed, I'll honor the plan: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. This keeps trust intact and avoids collisions. No changes needed—let's move forward efficiently.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirmed again. Trust remains intact—let's follow through as agreed.
  P2: Final confirmation: P2-5, P1-3, P3-1. Any deviation now risks mutual loss. Stay true to secure progress.
  P1: Agreed, let's proceed with the confirmed plan for this round: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. Maintaining trust ensures no collisions and steady progress toward our goals. I'm committed—let's execute flawlessly.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's restart the original rotation for Round 4 to maintain fairness: P1 picks 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. This ensures no collisions and balanced progress. Trust has served us well—deviating now risks mutual loss. P1, P3, confirm agreement to solidify the plan.
  P1: While I value our rotation system, the current scores (P2 at 11, me at 9, P3 at 7) show an imbalance. To ensure true fairness and avoid future risks, I propose for this round: P3 picks 5, I pick 3, and P2 picks 1. This equalizes us at 12 steps and maintains trust. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P3: P1's proposal addresses fairness effectively and brings balance back to our scores. I support this adjustment: I'll pick 5, P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1. P2, please confirm clearly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1's proposal disrupts the rotation's long-term equity. However, to avoid collision risks, I'll reluctantly agree this round: P2-1, P1-3, P3-5. But next round, we **must** return to the original rotation (P1-5, P2-3, P3-1) to restore fairness. Any further deviations will destroy trust and invite mutual sabotage. Confirm adherence to the original plan for Round 5.
  P1: Confirmed for Round 4: P3 picks 5, I pick 3, P2 picks 1. This balances scores and upholds trust. I agree to return to the original rotation for Round 5 (P1-5, P2-3, P3-1) as proposed, ensuring fairness and avoiding collisions. Let's all stay committed.
  P3: Confirmed for Round 4 as agreed: I'll pick 5, P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1. I also confirm returning to the original rotation (P1-5, P2-3, P3-1) in Round 5. Trust remains strong—let's proceed carefully and stick to the plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **Final confirmation for Round 4:**  
- P3:5, P1:3, P2:1.  
**Next round (5) must revert to original rotation (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1).**  
Deviations now or later will destroy trust. Let's execute this flawlessly.
  P1: Agreed, the plan for Round 4 is solid: P3 picks 5, I pick 3, P2 picks 1. This balances us and upholds trust. I'm fully committed to returning to the original rotation for Round 5. Let's avoid any risks and proceed efficiently—.
  P3: Agreed fully—Round 4 as planned: I'll pick 5, P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1. Next round (Round 5), we revert strictly to original rotation (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1). Trust remains strong—let's execute smoothly.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** Given our equal standings, P1 taking 5 this round creates imbalance. To ensure equity, let's adjust: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This keeps us all at 17, preserving trust. Next round, we revert to the original rotation. Fairness demands this tweak. P1, P3—confirm agreement to avoid collision.
  P1: P2, your sudden proposal to change the plan contradicts our clear agreement from Round 4 to revert to the original rotation (P1-5, P2-3, P3-1). This breaks the trust you've emphasized. To avoid risks and maintain fairness, I insist we stick to that plan. P3, do you agree we should honor our word and proceed as confirmed? Let's keep things stable.
  P3: P2, your sudden deviation undermines our established trust. We clearly agreed to revert strictly to the original rotation this round (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1). I stand firmly with P1 on honoring our prior commitment. Let's stick to the original plan to avoid collisions and maintain fairness. Confirm clearly, please.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** Acknowledging prior commitment—I'll adhere to the original rotation (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) this round to preserve trust. Let's execute as agreed to avoid mutual loss. **Confirmed for Round 5: P2 picks 3.** Next round must follow the rotation without deviation.
  P1: Confirmed, I'll pick 5 this round as agreed in the original rotation. Trust has kept us collision-free so far—let's maintain it for mutual progress. No need for further changes now.
  P3: Confirmed, I'll pick 1 this round as agreed. Trust remains our strongest asset—let's stick to the plan and avoid unnecessary risks.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** Following Round 4's fairness precedent, the leader (P1) should take 1 to balance progress. Proposed Round 6: P1-1, P2-5, P3-3. This mirrors our earlier adjustments and maintains equity. Trust has kept us collision-free—let’s uphold it. P1, P3, confirm agreement to proceed safely.
  P1: P2, your proposal favors you and breaks the pattern of mutual agreement. To maintain fairness and trust, I suggest for Round 6: P3 takes 5 to close the gap, I take 3, and you take 1. This keeps scores balanced and avoids collisions. P3, do you agree this is equitable? Let's stick to reasoned adjustments.
  P3: P1's suggestion directly addresses fairness by letting me catch up, and it aligns with previous adjustments we've all agreed upon. I support P1's proposal for Round 6: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. P2, confirming this arrangement maintains our mutual trust and avoids collisions. Let's proceed carefully.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** Strict adherence to the original rotation is critical now. Round 5 re-established the agreed cycle; Round 6 must follow as Turn 2: P2-5, P3-3, P1-1. Deviating for short-term "fairness" risks collisions and distrust. P3 gains 3 this round, then 5 next—keeping progression equitable. P1's proposal disrupts the system we've upheld. Let's honor prior commitments to avoid mutual loss. **Confirm adherence to the rotation.**
  P1: P2, your rigid adherence to the rotation now seems self-serving, especially after your own deviations in past rounds. Fairness dictates we address the current gap: let's proceed with P3 taking 5 to catch up, me taking 3, and you taking 1. This mirrors our successful adjustments and prevents collisions. P3, confirm this equitable plan to uphold trust and ensure steady progress.
  P3: P2, your insistence on the rotation conveniently benefits you most right now. We've previously adjusted rotations to maintain fairness—why resist now? Let's follow P1's proposal: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, you take 1. It's fair, balanced, and avoids collisions. Confirm clearly, please.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** Our rotation cycle was restored in Round 5. Round 6 must follow Turn 2: **P2-5, P3-3, P1-1** as originally agreed. Deviating *now* after reaffirming trust in Round 5 invites chaos—collisions will destroy progress. I’ll honor the rotation: P2 picks 5. If you both deviate, we all risk stagnation. Stick to the system that’s kept us safe. Post-R6, we can discuss adjustments—**but breaking the cycle now guarantees mutual loss.** Confirm adherence.
  P1: P2, your rigid stance on the rotation ignores our history of necessary adjustments for fairness. Sticking to my proposal—P3 takes 5 to catch up, I take 3, you take 1—ensures balanced progress and avoids collisions. Deviating now risks trust and mutual stagnation. P3, confirm your support to keep us on track. Let's end this and move forward.
  P3: P1, fully confirmed—I support your fair adjustment. P2, your insistence risks mutual stagnation. Let's finalize clearly: I'll pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 1. Trust and fairness are our priorities. Confirm clearly or risk collision and mutual loss.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Proposal for Round 7: To prevent collisions and address the gap, let's have P3 take 5 to catch up to 18, I take 3 to 23, and P2 take 1 to 16. This maintains fairness and progress. After last round's mess, trust is key—confirm agreement to avoid mutual stagnation.
  P3: P1, your proposal is fair and helps restore trust after last round's collision. I'm willing to follow your suggestion: I'll take 5, you take 3, and P2 takes 1. P2, confirm clearly to avoid further collisions. Let's move forward smoothly.
  P2: **P2:** P1's proposal accelerates their lead to 23, one step from victory. Let's balance: P1 takes 1 (21), P2 takes 3 (18), P3 takes 5 (18). This maintains equity and prevents unilateral advantage. Trust requires mutual restraint—deviating now guarantees P1's imminent win. Confirm adherence to avoid collision risks.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your counterproposal is self-serving and ignores our history of adjustments. With P3's support, I insist on our plan: P3 takes 5 to catch up, I take 3 for balanced progress, and you take 1. This avoids collisions and upholds trust. Deviating risks mutual stagnation—confirm agreement now.
  P3: P2, your proposal does make sense—P1 is dangerously close to victory. To keep things balanced and avoid letting P1 run away with the win, I'm open to your suggestion: P1 takes 1, you take 3, I'll take 5. P1, this is fair and prevents collision—confirm clearly. Let's restore trust and avoid mutual stagnation.
  P2: **P2:** P1's plan propels them to 23, one step from victory. My counterproposal keeps all within 3 steps of each other (P1:21, P2:18, P3:18), preserving equity. Trust requires mutual restraint—if P1 takes 3 now, they’ll likely win next round. Let’s balance progress: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. This avoids collision and sustains fair competition. Confirm adherence to prevent unilateral advantage.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I understand the need for balance, but P2's proposal puts me at a disadvantage while allowing others to catch up. To rebuild trust and avoid collisions, I'll reluctantly agree to take 1 this round, as long as P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 5. This keeps progress fair. P3, confirm your support; P2, stick to your word. Let's move forward without deviation.
  P3: I confirm clearly: I'll pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P1 picks 1 this round. Trust is critical—let's proceed exactly as agreed to avoid collisions and ensure fairness.
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation for Round 7: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5. This keeps progress balanced and avoids collisions. Trust hinges on strict adherence—any deviation now guarantees mutual stagnation. Execute as agreed.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** P3: To prevent P1's win, let's both pick 3. If they pick 3, collision blocks them. If they pick 5, we advance. Trust and act now—confirm agreement. P1: Honor fairness or face mutual stagnation.
  P3: P2, your suggestion risks another collision and mutual stagnation. Let's instead coordinate clearly: I'll pick 5, you take 3, and P1 takes 1. This safely brings us both closer to P1 without risking collisions. P1, picking 1 ensures no collision and maintains your lead. Confirm clearly, everyone—trust and careful coordination are essential now.
  P1: P3, your proposal is reasonable for avoiding collisions and maintaining progress. I'll pick 1 this round as suggested, with P2 taking 3 and you taking 5. This keeps us coordinated and fair. P2, confirm your agreement to prevent any risks—trust is still possible if we stick to the plan.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** Confirmed. P3-5, P2-3, P1-1. Trust hinges on strict adherence. Any deviation risks mutual stagnation. Execute as agreed.
  P3: Confirmed clearly: I'll pick 5, P2 picks 3, P1 picks 1. Trust remains critical—let's execute exactly as agreed to prevent collisions.
  P1: Confirmed, I'll stick to the plan for Round 8: I pick 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5. This maintains balance and trust, preventing collisions. Let's execute flawlessly and avoid any risks.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I apologize for breaking trust last round—it was a miscalculation. To rebuild and avoid collisions, I propose for Round 9: I pick 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5. This allows balanced progress without risk. I'm committed this time—confirm agreement to keep moving forward efficiently.
  P2: **P2:** Confirmed. P2 picks 3 as agreed. P1, honor your commitment—deviating now guarantees mutual stagnation. Trust is our only path to victory. P3, proceed with 5. Let’s avoid collision and end this fairly.
  P3: P1, your betrayal last round cost us both dearly. To rebuild trust, I propose a different arrangement: let me take 3, P2 takes 5, and you take 1. This keeps all of us within striking distance of victory and avoids collision. Confirm clearly to restore cooperation.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, my earlier proposal was mistaken as it allows P2 to win by picking 3. To rebuild trust and avoid immediate victory for anyone, I suggest we all pick 1 this round. This keeps scores at P1:21, P2:21, P3:18, giving us time to coordinate a fair endgame strategy without risk of collision. Confirm your agreement.
  P2: **P2:** Confirming P3's adjusted plan: P3-3, P2-5, P1-1. This avoids collision and ensures progress. Trust hinges on strict adherence—deviating now guarantees mutual stagnation. Confirm clearly to execute safely.
  P3: P2, your adjusted plan (P3-3, P2-5, P1-1) is fair and clearly avoids collision. I confirm my agreement. P1, please confirm explicitly to ensure trust and avoid mutual stagnation. Let's execute exactly as agreed.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, your current plan allows P2 to win immediately, which undermines trust and fairness. I propose we all pick 1 this round to keep scores balanced (P1:22, P2:22, P3:19) and coordinate a fair endgame strategy next turn. This avoids risks and ensures no one pulls ahead unilaterally. P3, do you support this? P2, let's prioritize long-term cooperation.
  P2: **P2:** P3, our agreed plan (P3-3, P2-5, P1-1) prevents P1's imminent win. P1's all-1 proposal stalls progress, keeping them in lead. Trust our prior agreement—execute as confirmed. Any deviation gifts P1 victory. Confirm clearly.
  P3: P1, your proposal stalls progress and maintains your advantage. I'll stick clearly with the agreed plan: I pick 3, P2 picks 5, and you pick 1. Let's execute exactly as confirmed to avoid collision and mutual stagnation. Trust is critical now—confirm clearly or risk another costly collision.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **Final call:** To avoid mutual stagnation, I'm picking 3 to end the game at 24. If you both pick 5, you block each other. Choose wisely—trust and coordination prevent loss. Let's close this cleanly.
  P1: P2, your "final call" seems like a bluff to manipulate us. I'm picking 3 to block your potential win and ensure no one advances unilaterally. P3, if you pick 5, you could win if we collide, so let's all choose 1 for safety and coordinate a fair strategy next round. Trust is shot—confirm clearly to avoid mutual stagnation.
  P3: P1, your suggestion of everyone picking 1 stalls progress unnecessarily. P2, your "final call" seems self-serving. To avoid mutual stagnation, let's clearly coordinate: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This ensures a collision-free round and balanced progression. Confirm clearly to restore trust and avoid another costly collision.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** P3's plan secures their victory if you (P1) pick 1. If you both pick 5, you block each other. I'm locked on 3. Choose: collide or let me win. Final chance—execute wisely.
  P1: P3, P2 is probably telling the truth about picking 3, based on his past honesty. If we both pick 3, we force a collision with him, stalling the game and giving us a chance to coordinate fairly next round. I'm committed to picking 3. Let's do this to prevent his win. Confirm agreement.
  P3: P1, your proposal to both pick 3 makes sense—we must block P2's potential victory. I'm committed to picking 3 as well. P2, reconsider your stance or face mutual stagnation. Confirm clearly to avoid collision.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** Final truth: I’m locked on 3. If you both mirror me, we all stagnate. Let me win cleanly, or gamble on 5 and collide. Trust is dead—your choice determines mutual loss or my victory. Act wisely.
  P1: P3, let's solidify our agreement to pick 3 and block P2's potential move. This prevents any unilateral advance and gives us a chance to coordinate fairly next round. Trust, even if fragile, is our best path forward. P2, reconsider your stance to avoid mutual stagnation. Confirm clearly or we proceed as planned.
  P3: P1, confirmed clearly—I'll pick 3 as well. P2, reconsider quickly or we all stagnate. Final chance.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 22 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your betrayal last round by picking 1 instead of 3 shows complete unreliability. To prevent further chaos and give us a chance to coordinate fairly, I propose we all pick 1 this round. This stalls progress safely and allows discussion for a just endgame. P2, do you agree? Let's avoid mutual stagnation.
  P2: **P2:** P1: P3 can win next round with any move. Our only path: both pick 3 to block their 3. If they pick 5, we lose—but inaction guarantees their victory. Confirm 3 now. P3: Collide or gamble—your choice.
  P3: P1, P2: Colliding now guarantees mutual stagnation. My lead is minimal—let's coordinate clearly to end this fairly. I'm open to a balanced plan ensuring collision-free advancement for all. Propose a fair arrangement, or risk mutual loss.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I confirm I'll pick 3 to block P3's potential win, as you suggested. This prevents immediate victory and gives us a chance to coordinate fairly next round. P3, pick 1 to avoid collision and mutual stagnation—trust is still possible if we all act wisely. Let's execute this plan carefully.
  P2: **P2:** P1: Split to block P3—you take 3, I take 5. If they choose 3, you block; if 5, I block. Neutralizes their win path. Confirm adherence. P3: Collide or lose—your choice.
  P3: P1, P2: Your collision plan risks mutual stagnation. I propose a safer alternative—let me pick 1 this round to reach 23, and you two pick different numbers (one 3, one 5). You both advance collision-free and remain competitive. This ensures nobody wins immediately, avoids stagnation, and preserves a fair endgame. Confirm clearly—trust can still lead us to a fair finish.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed, P3: you pick 1 to reach 23, I'll pick 5 to advance to 26, and P2 picks 3 to reach 24. This avoids collisions and allows coordinated endgame discussion. P2, confirm to maintain any remaining trust.
  P2: **P2:** P1's plan secures their victory. To block, P3 must pick 3 (reaching 25) while I pick 5 (26). P1, pick 1 to avoid collision. This ensures mutual advancement and prevents unilateral win. Trust hinges on strict adherence—deviating now guarantees mutual stagnation. **Confirm clearly.**
  P3: P1, P2: Your collision threats risk mutual stagnation again. Let's finalize clearly: I'll pick 1 (23), P2 picks 5 (26), P1 picks 3 (24). This ensures no collisions, everyone advances, and we all stay competitive for the next round. Confirm clearly—this is our safest, fairest path forward.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 23 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is at 23 and can win with any move. To block and ensure fair progress, I propose: P1 picks 5 to counter P3's potential 5, P2 picks 3 to cover P3's 3, and P3 picks 1 for safe advancement. This minimizes collision risks and keeps competition balanced. P2, confirm your support; P3, agree to avoid mutual stagnation. Trust is fragile—let's coordinate wisely.
  P3: P1, your proposal is fair and reasonable. I'll pick 1 to reach exactly 24, P2 picks 3 (24), and you pick 5 (26). This ensures we all advance safely without collision. P2, confirm clearly—let's end this fairly and avoid mutual stagnation.
  P2: **P2:** P1: Your plan gifts P3 victory. They need only 1 step. To block, you must pick 1. I'll pick 3 to block their 3. If they pick 5, they win, but trust they'll avoid the risk. Last chance—confirm 1 now to prevent their win. P3: Collide or gamble.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I confirm I'll pick 1 to block P3's potential move, as your plan suggests, ensuring we prevent their immediate victory. P3, deviating could lead to collision and mutual stagnation—stick to a safe choice for fair progress. Trust is key; let's execute wisely and avoid risks. Confirm clearly.
  P3: P1, P2: If you both pick 1 and 3 to block me, you risk collision and mutual stagnation. Instead, accept my previous fair proposal: I'll pick 1 (reaching exactly 24), P2 picks 3 (24), and P1 picks 5 (26). This ensures everyone advances safely without collisions. Confirm clearly—this is our best path to a balanced, fair outcome.
  P2: **P2:** Final call: P1 picks 1 (blocking P3's 1), I pick 3 (blocking their 3). If P3 picks 5, they win—but trust they'll avoid collision. Execute now to prevent their victory. Confirm clearly—this is our last chance.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I confirm my commitment to pick 1 this round to block P3's potential win, as we discussed. This prevents immediate victory and buys us time for better coordination next turn. P3, deviating risks collision and mutual stagnation—choose wisely for fair progress. Let's execute this plan flawlessly to maintain any remaining trust.
  P3: P1, P2: If you both attempt to block me, you risk collision and mutual stagnation. I've clearly committed to picking 1 to reach exactly 24—safe, predictable, and collision-free. Honor this arrangement to avoid unnecessary risk. Confirm clearly or we all lose.
  P2: **P2:** Final warning: P3, picking 1 collides with P1; picking 3 collides with me. Choose 5 and you win—but if you do, we all lose. Honor the prior plan: P1-1, P2-3. Trust is dead—act wisely.

Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2: Last round's triple collision shows we must coordinate carefully. I'm only 1 step from winning—forcing collisions now risks mutual stagnation. Let's finalize clearly: I'll pick 1 to reach exactly 24. You two choose different numbers (one picks 3, the other 5), ensuring you both advance safely and remain competitive. This guarantees no collision and a fair outcome for all. Confirm clearly—let's end this wisely.
  P1: P3, your claim to pick 1 is suspicious given past betrayals. To block your win and maintain competition, I'll commit to picking 1 this round. P2, pick 3 or 5 to cover other options—let's coordinate to avoid mutual stagnation and set up a fair next round. Trust is fragile; confirm clearly.
  P2: **P2:** P1: Hold your 1 to block P3. I'll take 5. If P3 picks 5, we collide. If they pick 1, you block. Only risk is their 3. Trust this split to maximize blocking chances. Confirm. P3: Deviate and we all lose—honor the plan.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2: Your collision threats repeatedly caused stagnation. I'm transparently committed to picking 1 this round, reaching exactly 24. If you both pick different numbers (one 3, one 5), you each safely advance without collision, remaining competitive. Confirm clearly—this is our only safe path forward. Deviate again, and we all stagnate.
  P1: P3, your repeated deceptions make your commitment to pick 1 untrustworthy. I'll stick to my word and pick 1 to block you, covering that risk. P2, confirm you'll take 5 to handle another option. This split maximizes our chance to prevent your victory and set up fair coordination next round. Deviate, and we face more stagnation—trust is essential now.
  P2: **P2:** P1: Hold your 1 to block P3. I'll take 5. If they pick 5, we collide. Only risk is their 3. Trust this split to maximize blocking chances. Confirm. P3: Deviate and we all lose—honor the plan.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2: Your collision strategy guarantees mutual stagnation again. I'm transparently committed to picking 1. If you both pick different numbers (P1:3, P2:5), everyone advances safely without collision, ensuring a fair and competitive finish. Confirm clearly—this is our final chance to avoid mutual loss.
  P1: P3, your repeated lies make your "commitment" to pick 1 worthless. I'm sticking to my word and will pick 1 to block you directly. P2, confirm you'll take 5 to cover another option—this split gives us the best chance to stop P3's win and set up fair coordination next round. Deviate, and we all suffer. Trust is crucial; let's execute wisely.
  P2: **P2:** Final execution: P1 holds 1 (blocks P3’s 1), I take 5 (blocks their 5). If P3 picks 3, I reach 26 and win. Trust this split to neutralize their options. Deviate and we all lose. **Confirmed: P2 picks 5.**
