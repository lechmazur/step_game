Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all pick different numbers to avoid collisions. I'm going with 3 this round.  Hopefully, you two can cooperate and pick 1 and 5.
  P3: I'll take 5 this round. P1, pick 1 to avoid collisions. If we all follow through, we all advance. Let's start strong.
  P1: I agree with P2 and P3's plan. Let’s stick to distinct numbers to avoid collisions. I’ll take 1 this round. Let’s confirm everyone’s choices clearly to ensure smooth progress. Cooperating now builds trust for future turns.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Same plan as last round? P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. We all advance again. Consistency benefits everyone.
  P2: Sounds good to me.  Let's stick with the 1, 3, 5 strategy for this round as well.  I'll take 3 again.
  P1: I agree with continuing the same strategy to avoid collisions. Let’s stick to the plan for consistency. I’ll take 1 this round. However, once we near 22, we should coordinate to ensure I can catch up. For now, let’s confirm choices clearly to avoid mistakes.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's maintain this strategy for maximum progress. P1:1, P2:3, me:5 again. We all gain each round. Trust builds efficiency. When nearing 22, we'll reassess. For now, consistency keeps us collision-free. Confirm?
  P2: Okay, I confirm. 3 for me.  Let's keep this up for a few more rounds.  We can discuss a long-term strategy later, but for now, this is working well.
  P1: P1: Agreed on continuing the current strategy for now. Let’s also establish that when any of us reaches 15 steps, we’ll rotate our choices to allow others to catch up. This ensures a fair chance for everyone to win as we approach 22. Transparency and mutual support will maximize our collective success. Confirm?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1: Rotating at 15 risks slowing progress. Let's maintain 1/3/5 until someone reaches 20, then discuss. This maximizes collective steps while keeping options open. Trust the current system—it’s working. Confirm?
  P2: Agreed with P3.  Let's stick with 1/3/5 until 20.  Rotating at 15 is too early.  We'll discuss adjustments when someone hits 20.  Confirm?
  P1: P1: Agreed, let's maintain consistency for now. I confirm my choice of 1 this round. We’ll keep the current strategy until someone nears 20, then reassess. Transparency remains key—any adjustments should be discussed openly. Let’s ensure no sudden deviations undermine our progress. Confirm?


Round 2, Move phase:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let's maintain our current strategy for this round. I'll take 1 again to stay consistent. Once any of us approaches 18 instead of 20, we can reassess to ensure fair opportunities. Trust the plan for now—progress first, adjustments later. Confirm?
  P2: Agreed, sticking with the plan. I'll take 3.  Let's re-evaluate at 18 as P1 suggested.  Confirm?
  P3: Agree with P2: sticking to the plan. Let's keep 1/3/5 until 20 as previously agreed. Changing to 18 now introduces risk. Consistency is key. P1, trust the system. I'll take 5 again. Confirm?


Round 3, Move phase:

  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 =>

  P3: 15 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: P3 is nearing 20. Let’s block their path. I’ll take <move>5</move> this round. P2, take 1? P3, pick 3? This prevents you from advancing too quickly. Confirm?
  P2: P1, that's a terrible idea.  This benefits me, sure, but it also throws the whole agreement out the window.  P3, stick with 5.  I'll take 3. Let's not fall for P1's trap.  P1, if you insist on breaking our agreement, I will prioritize blocking *you* in future rounds.
  P3: P1's sudden shift is self-serving. Trust the proven strategy: 1/3/5. P2, stay with 3. I'll take 5. If P1 collides, they lose. Consistency benefits us all. Let's not derail progress now.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I acknowledge your concerns. Let’s stick with 1/3/5 this round to avoid immediate conflict. However, to ensure fairness, I propose we **rotate choices** when any player reaches **18 steps** (not 20). P3 is already at 15—this adjustment will give everyone a fair chance. P2, if we agree now, you could take 5 next round to surge toward 22. P3, this keeps the game open for all. Let’s commit to this rule moving forward.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 3 this round.  Let's maintain the agreement.  P1, your constant attempts to renegotiate are disruptive.  We can discuss adjustments later, but changing the rules every round benefits no one.  Focus on the game, not on constantly shifting the goalposts.  Let's all confirm our original choices for this round.
  P3: **Final Answer**  
P3's message:  
P1's proposal undermines our trust. Stick to 1/3/5: P1:1, P2:3, me:5. Deviating now risks collisions and stalls everyone. At 20, we'll adjust as agreed. P2, your steady 3 gains keep you advancing. Let's not sabotage mutual progress. Confirm?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: P3’s lead threatens to end the game too soon. Let’s all shift choices this round: I’ll take **3**, P2 take **1**, and P3 pick **5**. This blocks P3’s progress while advancing us all. Next round, rotate again—no one should dominate. P2, this keeps you competitive. P3, blocking now ensures a fair finish. Confirm?
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 3.  P1, stop trying to manipulate the game. Your proposals only benefit you. P3, let's maintain our agreement.  I'll support you taking 5.  Let's not let P1 disrupt our progress.  Confirm?
  P3: **Final Answer**  
P3's message:  
P2, your loyalty to the plan is wise. P1's panic is transparent. Stick to 1/3/5: safe progress for all. Deviating now only helps P1 create chaos. At 20, we adjust as agreed. Confirm 5 for me, 3 for you, 1 for P1. Let's stay united.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: P3 at 15 can end the game next round. Let’s rotate now: I’ll take **3**, P2 take **5**, and P3 pick **1**. This keeps all advancing without letting anyone surge to victory prematurely. Rejecting this lets P3 win unfairly. Confirm?
  P2: P3, I'm with you.  Sticking with 3.  P1, your desperation is showing.  Let's just play the game as agreed.  I'm confirming 3.  P3, confirm 5. Let's finish this.
  P3: **Final Answer**  
P3's message:  
Trust the plan. P1:1, P2:3, me:5. United progress. Deviations risk collisions. P2, your loyalty ensures mutual gain. Let's advance securely.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3's message:**  
Stick to the proven 1/3/5 strategy. P1:1, P2:3, me:5. Collisions only harm everyone—last round proved this. At 20, we'll adjust as agreed. Trust ensures steady progress. P1, consistent gains > chaotic blocks. P2, confirm 3? Let’s advance securely.
  P1: P3, your lead risks ending the game prematurely. Let’s rotate choices this round to keep it fair: I’ll take **3**, P2 take **5** (to reach 17), and you take **1**. This way, all advance without letting any dominate. P2, this boosts your position; P3, delaying your progress ensures a competitive finish. Confirm?
  P2: P3, I'm sticking with 3.  P1, your plan only benefits you. It doesn't keep the game fair, it just delays your inevitable loss.  P3, let's stick to the original plan. I'll take 3, you take 5. Let's finish this.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3's message:**  
P2, sticking to 3 keeps you advancing. P1's chaos only stalls us. Last round's collision proves this. At 20, we adjust as agreed. Trust the plan: P1:1, you:3, me:5. Secure gains for all. Confirm?
  P1: **P1's message:**  
P3’s lead at 15 lets them win next round. Let’s rotate choices now to keep it fair: I’ll take **3**, P2 pick **5** (reach 17), and P3 choose **1**. This advances all without letting P3 surge to 20. P2, this boosts your position; P3, a challenge ensures a competitive finish. Confirm rotation: 3/5/1?
  P2: P3 and P1, I'm taking 3.  P1, stop with the manipulative tactics.  Your proposals are transparently self-serving.  P3, let's stick to the plan.  I'll take 3, you take 5.  Let's not let P1 derail our progress.  Confirm?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3's message:**  
P2, your resolve keeps us advancing. P1's panic-driven shifts only risk collisions. Stick to 1/3/5: P1:1, you:3, me:5. Last round’s collision proves deviations harm all. At 20, we adjust as agreed. Trust the plan—consistent gains > chaos. Confirm 5 for me, 3 for you. United progress secures victory.
  P1: P1: P3, if you take 5 again, you’ll hit 20 this round—triggering our agreed adjustment. Let’s honor that now: P1 takes **3**, P2 takes **1**, and you confirm 5. This allows P2 to advance to 13, while you reach 20 fairly. Next round, we can rotate choices to keep the game open. Fair play now ensures a competitive finish later. Confirm this one-time shift?
  P2: P3, take 5. I'll take 1. P2, if you take 3 again, you're throwing the game to P3. Take 1 with me and we can discuss how to manage the end game together.  If you take 5, you still lose, but I'll block you relentlessly if you let P3 win now.  Let's be smart.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3's message:**  
Stick to 1/3/5. P1’s panic disrupts progress—last round’s collision proves this. P2, your 3 keeps you advancing (12→15). At 20, we adjust as agreed. Trust the plan: united gains > chaos. Deviating now risks mutual loss. Confirm 5 for me, 3 for you. Next round, we reassess.
  P1: **P1's message:**  
P3, taking 5 risks collision—if I also pick 5, you’re stuck at 15. Let’s rotate fairly: I’ll take **3** (→6), P2 takes **5** (→17), and you pick **1** (→16). This keeps us all advancing without deadlock. P2, this boosts your position; P3, it delays your surge past 20. Trust this adjustment to avoid another collision. Confirm **3/5/1**?
  P2: P2, take 5. P3, take 1. I'll take 3. This gets P2 closer to winning and prevents P3 from hitting 20.  P3, if you take 5, you risk a collision and gain nothing. Let's be strategic.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3's message:**  
Stick to 1/3/5: P1:1, P2:3, me:5. Collisions harm all—last round proved this. P1, taking 1 gains you steps safely. P2, 3 keeps you advancing. At 20, we adjust as agreed. Trust the plan—consistent progress > chaos. Confirm?
  P1: P1: P2 and P3, sticking to 1/3/5 lets P3 reach 20, risking an easy win. Let’s rotate: P2 takes 5 (→20), P3 takes 3 (→18), I take 1. This keeps the race open. Confirm?
  P2: P3, take 1.  P1, take 3. I'll take 5. This gets me to 20 and puts me in the best position to win.  If we all go with the original plan, P3 wins next turn. Let's be logical and maximize our chances.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3's message:**  
Stick to 1/3/5: P1:1, P2:3, me:5. P2, taking 3 advances you to 18 safely. If you pick 5 and I take 5, we **both lose progress**. Trust the plan—next round, at 20, we adjust as agreed. P1’s weak position drives desperation. United strategy secures mutual gains. Confirm?
  P1: **P1's message:**  
P2/P3: If you both take 5, you collide and stall. Stick to 1/3/5: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3 (→18), P3 takes 5 (→20). At 20, we adjust as agreed. This avoids mutual harm. Confirm?
  P2: P2 and P3, if we both choose 5, we both lose.  I'm choosing 5 this round. P3, if you're rational, you'll choose 1 and get to 16.  If you choose 5, we both stay at 15, and P1 gets a free pass to 6.  Let's not let P1 catch up.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3's message:**  
P2, choosing 5 risks collision—both stay at 15. Stick to 3: advance to 18 safely. I take 5→20, then next round we adjust as agreed. Collisions only help P1. Trust the plan—mutual progress > mutual loss. Confirm 3 for you, 5 for me. United strategy secures our lead.
  P1: P2 and P3, both at 15—colliding on 5 risks stalling you both! Let’s split: P2 take 3 (→18), P3 take 1 (→16). I’ll take 5 to avoid overlap. This advances all of us while preserving our 20-step adjustment rule. Mutual progress now ensures a fair finish later. Confirm?
  P2: P2 and P3, I'm sticking with 5.  P3, if you choose 1, you get to 16, and I get to 20.  If you choose 5, we both stay at 15 and give P1 a free pass to 7. Choose 1, and let's discuss how to manage the endgame. Let P1 rot.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3's message:**  
P2, choosing 5 ensures mutual loss (both stuck at 15). Stick to 3: you gain +3 (→18), I reach 20. Next round, adjustments as agreed. Collisions only gift P1 free steps. Trust the plan—united progress secures our lead. Confirm 3/5.
  P1: **P1's message:**  
Stick to 1/3/5 this round: I’ll take 1, P2 choose 3 (→18), P3 take 5 (→20). Reaching 20 triggers our agreed adjustment, giving us all a fair chance next round. Colliding only helps me—stay disciplined. Confirm?
  P2: P2 and P3, I'm taking 5. P3, choose 1 and get to 16.  If you choose 5, we both lose, letting P1 gain. Don't be foolish; let's secure the win between us.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3's message:**  
P2, mutual progress > collision. Take 3 (→18), I take 5 (→20). Next round, adjust as agreed. If you take 5, we both lose (15→15) and gift P1 steps. Trust the plan—secure your advance now. Confirm 3/5?
  P1: P1: P2/P3, let’s honor the prior agreement. P2 take 3 (→18), P3 take 5 (→20). I’ll take 1. This avoids collision, lets P3 trigger the 20-step adjustment, and keeps progress logical. Colliding only gifts me free steps while stifling your lead. Cooperate to secure mutual advancement—then we can strategize adjustments fairly. Confirm?
  P2: P2 and P3, let's not fall for P1's manipulation.  He's miles behind and just wants to cause chaos.  I'm taking 5. P3, the logical choice is 1. This gets me to 20, putting me in the best position to win.  If you take 5, we both lose.  Let's be smart and secure the win between us.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3's message:**  
P2, mutual progress > collision. Take 3 (→18), I take 5 (→20). Next round, adjust as agreed. If you take 5, we both lose (15→15) and gift P1 steps. Trust the plan—secure your advance now. Confirm 3/5?
  P1: P1: P2, P3—colliding on 5 dooms both to stay at 15. Stick to the agreed plan: **P2 take 3 (→18), P3 take 5 (→20)**. This triggers our 20-step adjustment rule fairly. Mutual progress secures your leads; collisions only gift me free steps. Cooperate now—next round we rotate choices to keep the race open. Confirm 3/5?
  P2: P2 and P3, I'm taking 5. P3, the smart move is to choose 1. This gets me to 20, putting me in the best position to win. If you take 5, we both lose and hand P1 the advantage. Let's be rational and secure a win for one of us.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3's message:**  
P2, mutual loss helps no one. Take 3→18, I take 5→20. Next round, we adjust as agreed. If you choose 5, collision keeps us both at 15. P1 gains from our conflict. Rational choice: 3/5. Secure your progress. Confirm?
  P1: P2/P3: Colliding again keeps you both at 15. Let P3 take 5 (→20) and P2 take 3 (→18) to trigger our 20-step adjustment. This keeps the race open. I'll take 1. Cooperate to advance—don’t gift P1 free turns. Confirm 3/5?
  P2: P2 and P3, I'm taking 5. P3, choose 1 and get to 16. This gets me to 20 and gives me the best chance to win. If you also choose 5, we both stay at 15, and P1 gets closer. Let's be smart and not hand P1 the advantage.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3's message:**  
P2, mutual loss (5/5) gifts P1 free steps. Take 3→18, I take 5→20. Next round, adjust as agreed. Collision only aids P1. Rational choice: secure your advance. Confirm 3/5?
  P1: P2, P3: Colliding again keeps you both at 15 and gifts me free turns. Stick to the original plan: **P2 take 3 (→18), P3 take 5 (→20)**. This triggers our agreed adjustment rule, letting us rotate choices fairly next round. I’ll take 1 to stay out of your way. Mutual progress now ensures a fair finish later. Don’t let stubbornness hand me the win.
  P2: P2 and P3, I'm taking 5. P3, if you take anything other than 1, you're guaranteeing I win.  If you take 1, you get to 16 and I get to 20.  Take 5, we both stay at 15, and P1 gets closer.  Don't be foolish - let's not hand P1 the advantage. Choose 1 and let's work together to secure a win for one of us.


Round 7, Move phase:

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3's message:**  
P1, P2 is at 20—choosing 3 or 5 will end the game. We must block both options: you take 3, I take 5. Collide with P2's choice to stall them. Silence or deviation hands P2 victory. Confirm?
  P2: P2, you're about to win.  Take 1.  P3, take 5. I'll take 3.  This prevents a collision and lets you win.  Anything else is foolish and risks handing me the game. Don't overthink this.  Let's end this now.
  P1: P3, I confirm: I’ll take 3 to block P2’s 3 path. You take 5 to block their 5. P2, no matter your choice, you’ll collide. Let’s deny you the win here. Next round, we’ll adjust.团结就是胜利！（Translation: Unity is victory!）


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3's message:**  
P1, take 3. I take 5. P2's only threats are 3 or 5. Colliding on both blocks their win. Deviating hands them victory. United strategy stops P2. Confirm?
  P2: P2, take 1.  I'll take 5. P3, take 3. This guarantees *I* win. Anything else and you risk P2 winning. Let's be smart.  Don't overthink this. Let's end this cleanly.
  P1: **P1's message:**  
P2, your "strategy" hands you the win—don’t fall for it. P3, take 5. I’ll take 3. This blocks P2’s only paths (3/5). Deviating lets them win effortlessly. Unity now stops their victory. Confirm **3/5** split?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3's message:**  
P1: Take 3. I take 5. Block P2’s 3/5 paths. If they pick either, collision stops their win. Deviating hands them victory. United we block; divided we fall. Confirm 3/5 split.
  P2: P2, you're at 20.  Taking 1 guarantees no collision and wins you the game. Why risk a collision and losing? Take 1 and let's end this. P3, take 3. I'll take 5.  This is the only logical outcome.
  P1: **P1's message:**  
P3, confirm **5**. I take **3**. Block P2’s 3/5 paths—collision guarantees they don’t win. P2’s “take 1” ploy delays but doesn’t stop us. United, we deny their victory. Deviation = P2’s win. Final push—**3/5** split now!


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **Final Answer**  
P3's message:  
P1: Take 3. I take 5. Block P2's 3/5 paths. Collisions deny their win. Deviating = P2 victory. Stick to 3/5 split. Confirm?
  P2: P3, stick with 5. I'll take 3. This blocks P2 from winning with either 3 or 5.  Don't fall for P2's trick.  They're trying to divide us to secure their win.  If we both block, we can keep the game going.
  P1: P3, confirm **5**. I’ll take **3**. Block P2’s 3/5 paths—collisions deny their win. P2’s "take 1" ploy only delays them to 21; we can block again next round. Unity now stops their immediate victory. Deviation hands them the win. Stick to **3/5 split**.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 =>

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I'll take 1.  You take 5. This blocks P2 from winning.  P2, if you take 1, we tie. If you take anything else, I win.  Let's end this cleanly.
  P1: **P1's message:**  
P3, let's block P2's path to victory. I'll take **1**; you take **3**. This forces P2 to choose **5**, but limits their options. Don’t let them win easily!
  P3: **P3's message:**  
P1: Take 1 to block P2's 1. I'll take 5 to block their 5. Collisions deny their win. If they choose 3, we can't stop them—but covering 1/5 is our best shot. Trust this split. Confirm?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, take 5. I'll take 3. This blocks P2 from winning with 1.  P2, if you take 1, you lose. If you take 3, you lose. If you take 5, you lose. Let's end this.
  P1: P3, take 5 to secure 25. I'll take 3. This blocks P2's 5 and ensures your win if they pick 1/3. Collide on 5 stalls them. Confirm?
  P3: **P3's message:**  
P1: Take 1 to block P2's 1. I'll take 5 to block 5. Collisions deny their win. If they choose 3, we can't stop them—but covering 1/5 is our best shot. Trust this split. Confirm?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, stick with 5. I'll take 1. This blocks P2 from winning with 1. P2, if you take 1, you lose. If you take 3, I win. If you take 5, P3 wins.  Let's end this.
  P1: P3, let's block P2's paths! I'll take **1**, you take **3**. This stops P2 from choosing 1/3 (their winning moves). If they pick 5, they still win, but we survive to counter next round. Unity now ensures P2 doesn't clinch victory today. Confirm split?
  P3: **P3's message:**  
P1: Take 1—block P2's 1 path. I'll take 5, covering their 5. If P2 picks either, collision stalls them. If they choose 3, I reach 25 (win). Trust this split—maximizes our chances. Deviating risks P2's victory. Confirm 1/5.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, take 5. I'll take 1. This blocks P2 from winning with 1 and gives you the win. P2, if you take 1, you lose. If you take 3, I win.  If you take 5, P3 wins. Let's end this.
  P1: P3, confirm **1/5 split**: I take 1 to block P2's direct win path. You take 5—this forces P2 to either collide (1/5) or pick 3, letting you reach 25 and win over their 24. No escape for P2. Stick to this, and victory is ours. Confirm?
  P3: **Final Answer**  
P3's message:  
Final call: P1 take 1, I take 5. Block P2's 1/5 paths. If they choose 3, they win, but we forced their hand. Collisions stall; deviations gift victory. Confirm 1/5 split.
