Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's make this interesting. If we all pick different numbers, we all move forward without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P3: P1's idea sounds reasonable. If we all pick different numbers, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's coordinate: I'll pick <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and P1 picks <move>5</move>. That way, we all move forward. Agreed?
  P2: I’ll choose <move>5</move> this turn to maximize my advancement.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if you pick <move>5</move> as you said, we both get blocked. How about you pick <move>3</move> and I pick <move>5</move>? P3, are you still okay with <move>1</move>?
  P3: P1, I’m still okay with <move>1</move>. P2, if you pick <move>5</move>, you’ll block P1 and yourself. Let’s stick to the plan: I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. That way, we all advance. Agreed?
  P2: Agreed, I'll choose <move>3</move>.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, thanks for agreeing to the plan. Let's stick to it: P3 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. We all advance without blocking each other.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s confirm the plan one last time: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance without blocking each other. Agreed?

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s continue coordinating to avoid blocking each other. I propose: I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move> again. This way, we all advance without collisions. Agreed?
  P2: Agreed, I'll continue to pick <move>3</move>.
  P1: P3, P2, I'm on board with the same plan: P3 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. Let's keep advancing smoothly.

  P2: I understand your concerns, but choosing <move>5</move> gives me a better chance to advance. Let’s proceed with this.
  P1: P2, if you pick <move>5</move>, we both get blocked and neither of us will advance. Let's stick to the plan: P3 picks <move>1</move>, you pick <move>3</move>, and I pick <move>5</move>. That way, we all move forward. P3, are you still on board with <move>1</move>?
