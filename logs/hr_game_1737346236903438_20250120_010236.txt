Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This way, we can all advance smoothly. What do you think?
  P1: I appreciate the suggestion, but why should I take the smallest step? I think it would be fairer if I took 5, P2 took 1, and P3 took 3. That way we all still avoid collisions but distribute the steps more evenly.
  P3: I think we should aim for a balanced approach. How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I (P3) take 1? This way, we all get a chance to advance, and we can rotate the numbers in future rounds to keep it fair. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see the value in both proposals, but let's compromise. How about P1 takes 3, I (P2) take 5, and P3 takes 1 this round? We can rotate the numbers each round to ensure fairness and avoid collisions. This way, everyone gets a chance to advance with larger steps over time. What do you say?
  P1: I agree with P2's last suggestion. Taking 3 this round is fair, and we can rotate positions in future rounds. Let's stick to this plan and avoid collisions.
  P3: I agree with the plan to avoid collisions and ensure everyone gets a chance to advance. Let's stick with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and I (P3) taking 1 for this round. We can rotate the numbers in future rounds to keep things fair.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Great, we're all on the same page for this round. Let's make sure we stick to the plan and move forward together. Looking forward to rotating the steps in the next rounds to keep things fair and exciting.
  P1:

Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm glad we've agreed on a plan for this round. Let's execute it and see how it goes. Remember, we can adjust our strategy in the next round based on how this one plays out. Looking forward to a smooth start and continued fair play.
  P1: 
  P3: P3: I think we have a solid plan for this round. Let's stick to it and see how it goes. If we avoid collisions, we can build on this strategy in the next rounds. I'll take 1 as agreed. Let's keep the lines of communication open and make adjustments as needed. Good luck, everyone!

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
