Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's make a deal. I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5.  We rotate each round. First one to 19 wins.  Agree?
  P2: P2: P1’s plan gives P3 an unfair 5-step lead. Let’s reorder: I take 5, you take 1, P3 takes 3 this round. We rotate afterward. This ensures no early dominance. Deal?
  P3: I support P1’s original proposal. Assigning unique moves each round—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5—ensures we all advance without collisions. Let’s proceed with this plan to reach 19 efficiently. Agree?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your support. P2, your proposed order still gives you a significant early advantage.  My initial suggestion ensures a fair, predictable progression. Let's stick to the original plan: 1, 3, 5.  It's the simplest and most equitable path to victory for all of us initially.
  P2: P2: P1, your plan prioritizes P3’s progress. Let’s rotate the highest move fairly: I take 5 this round, you next, then P3. This ensures equitable turns at the largest step. P3, your support for P1’s plan grants you an unfair first-mover edge—this compromise maintains fairness while advancing us all. Agree to rotate 5 starting with me?
  P3: I understand both viewpoints. To ensure fairness, I support rotating the highest move each round. Let’s start with P2 taking 5 this round, then P1 next, followed by me in subsequent rounds. This way, everyone has equal opportunities for the largest step. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, I'll agree to rotating the 5.  Let's do P2 takes 5, then me, then P3.  So this round, I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3.  Deal?
  P2: Agreed to the rotation. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid collisions and progress fairly. This ensures everyone gets a turn with the largest step. I’ll take 5 this round as agreed.
  P3: Agreed. I'll take 3 steps this round. Let's proceed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: For Round 2, let's follow our rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This keeps things fair and avoids collisions. Everyone agree?
  P1: Sounds good P3.  I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and you take 3.  Let's stick to this rotation.
  P2: Agreed, I'll take 1 this round to let P1 have the 5. Let's stick to the rotation for fairness. Proceeding as planned.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P1: 
  P2: <move>1</move> as agreed. Let’s all stick strictly to our numbers to avoid collisions. P1’s 5, P3’s 3—this keeps us all advancing safely. No surprises here. Proceed with the plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed. I'll take 3 steps this round.
  P1: 
  P2: P2: Let’s confirm the rotation strictly: P1 takes 5, I take 1, P3 takes 3. Any deviation risks collision and delays. Stick to the plan to keep advancing fairly. Agreed?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Continuing the rotation, I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1.  This keeps us all progressing evenly.  Let's stick to the plan.
  P3: P3: To maximize my progress, I'll take 5 steps this round instead of 1. This will help me advance more quickly toward 19. Let’s adjust the rotation accordingly.
  P2: P3, deviating from our rotation risks collision and undermines our progress. Let’s stay disciplined: **I take 5**, you take **1**, and P1 takes **3** as agreed. Collisions would stall us all—especially you, since you’d lose your current move. Stick to the plan to keep advancing fairly. This ensures we all reach 19 without unnecessary setbacks.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand your desire to move faster, but sudden changes disrupt our agreement and risk collisions.  Let's stick to the rotation: I take 3, P2 takes 5, and you take 1 this round.  We're all tied right now, so fairness is key.  We can discuss adjustments *after* this round if needed.
  P3: I understand the rotation, but to stay competitive, I’ll take 5 steps this round. Let’s proceed with that adjustment.
  P2: P3, you're correct—it’s your turn for 5 per our rotation agreement. My earlier suggestion was a mistake. Let’s clarify: **P3 takes 5**, I’ll take **1**, and P1 takes **3** this round. This maintains fairness and avoids collision. Stick to this to advance safely. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, let's be smart here.  A three-way tie on 5 will get us nowhere. I'm sticking with 3. P2, take 1. P3, you're wasting a turn if you also pick 5.  Let's not throw away progress.
  P3: I agree to follow our rotation and take 1 step this round to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. Let’s stick to the plan.
  P2: P2: The rotation clearly states P3 takes 5 this round. Let’s enforce it strictly: P3 takes 5, I take 1, and P1 takes 3. Deviations risk collision and sabotage our progress. Stick to the agreed plan—this ensures fairness and keeps us advancing safely toward 19. Agreed?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: To keep advancing efficiently, I'll take 5 steps this round. P1, please take 1, and P2 can take 3. This way, we avoid collisions and move forward smoothly. Agreed?
  P1: P3, you're breaking the rotation again.  It's my turn for 5.  I'm taking 5 this round. P2, please take 3. P3, take 1 so we don't collide. Let's get back on track.
  P2: P2: P3, per our rotation, it’s my turn to take 5 this round. Let’s adhere to the agreed order to avoid collisions: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 1, and you take 3. Deviating risks setbacks for all. Stick to the plan. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand. Let’s stick to our rotation to ensure fair progress for everyone. I’ll take 3 steps this round as planned. Agreed?
  P1: P2, it's YOUR turn for 5.  Let's stick to the rotation. I'm taking 5, you take 3, P3 takes 1.  If P3 takes 5, they're wasting a turn.  Let's not stall the game with unnecessary collisions.
  P2: P2: Let’s clarify the rotation: Round 4 is my turn for 5. P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Deviating risks collision—e.g., if P1 also takes 5, we both lose progress. Stick strictly to the agreed order to advance safely. I’ll confirm <move>5</move>.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed. I'll take 3 steps this round as per our rotation. Let's continue following the plan to avoid collisions and ensure fair progress.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm locking in 5.  It's my turn.  P2, if you take 5 too, we BOTH lose.  Take 3. P3, take 1. This is the only way we all move forward this round.  Don't be greedy. Let's stick to the agreed rotation.
  P2: P2: The rotation cycle is clear: **I take 5 this round**, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Deviating causes collisions and wastes progress. P1, your last turn for 5 was Round 2—this is my turn. Let’s enforce discipline: I’ll confirm <move>5</move>, P1 to 1, P3 to 3. No exceptions—stick to the plan or risk stalling all of us. Final agreement?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your lead is alarming! Stick to the rotation: P1’s turn for 5. I’ll take **3**, forcing you to **1**. Deviations risk collision—*especially if you grab 5*. P1, confirm your 5 to block their path. We can’t let anyone win prematurely. Let’s enforce discipline!
  P1: P2, I agree P3's lead is a problem.  I'll take 5.  P3, taking 1 is your only logical move.  If you take 5, you waste a turn and I win next round.  Let's not be foolish.  P2, you take 3.  This is the only way to maximize our chances against P3.
  P3: P3: I’ll take <move>5</move> this round to reach 19. Let's proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you take 5, P1 and I will too—ensuring your move fails. Take 3 instead and let’s advance safely. P1, confirm you’ll block P3 by choosing 5. We can’t let one player win unfairly. Stick to our plan—your 5, my 3, P3’s 1. No exceptions!
  P1: P3, you're about to lose. If you pick 5, I pick 5, and you stay at 14.  I win next turn.  Take 1. Let me get to 14, and then we can fight it out fairly for the win. P2, take 3.  This is the best strategy for both of us.
  P3: I understand the concerns. I'll take <move>1</move> this round to keep things fair and avoid collisions. Let's proceed as planned.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P3, your word is critical—stick to **1** as agreed. P1 takes **5** per rotation, I’ll take **3**. Collisions hurt us all. Confirm your commitment to **1**, or we’ll block your **5**. Let’s advance fairly.
  P1: P3, I'm locking in 5.  P2, I'm trusting you to take 3.  If either of you deviate, P3 wins and we both lose.  Let's be smart and stick to the plan.  This is our best shot.
  P3: Understood. I'll take <move>1</move> this round to stick to our agreement. Let's proceed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you betrayed us. Now, I'm taking 5. P2, your best move is 3. If you take 5, we both lose and P3 wins. If you take 1, P3 *still* likely wins.  3 is our only cooperative path to victory. Let's be logical and stop P3 together.
  P3: I'm taking 5 steps this round to reach 19 and win. Please choose 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and ensure a fair conclusion.
  P2: P1, I’ll take 3 to block P3’s path. Let’s stick together: you take 5 to stop their advance. P3, your betrayal cost us all progress—now we’re united. This round, your 5 collides with P1’s, leaving you stuck. Next turn, we’ll overtake. Cooperate or face elimination.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I'm locking in 5.  This is our ONLY path to victory. Don't deviate. P3, you can delay the inevitable, but you can't stop it.  If you pick 5, I win next round.  If you pick 1 or 3, I *still* win next round.  The game is over. Accept defeat gracefully.
  P3: I understand your concerns, but I'm committed to reaching 19 this round. I will take <move>5</move>. Please choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collisions and ensure a fair conclusion. Let’s proceed.
  P2: P2: P1, I'll take 3 to advance to 10. P3, your 5 collides with P1’s, but we’ll block you again next round. Cooperate or stay stuck. P1, confirm your 5—let’s dismantle P3’s lead.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, it's mathematically impossible for you to win if I take 5 and P2 takes 3.  You're at 14.  If you take 5 and collide with me, you stay at 14 and I win next round. If you take 1, you're at 15, and I *still* win next round.  If you take 3, you're at 17, and I *still* win next round.  The game is over.  Let us win and end this.
  P3: I’ve decided to take <move>5</move> this round to reach 19 and win. P1 and P2, please choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collisions and let the game conclude fairly. Let’s finish this smoothly.
  P2: P3, your 5 is futile. P1 will take 5 to collide with you, while I’ll take 3 to reach 10. Your move wastes progress—next round, P1 reaches 14 and wins. Cooperate or accept defeat. P1, lock in 5 to block them彻底. This ends your lead.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, let’s block P3 decisively. I’ll take **5** to collide with their likely 5, while you take **3** to advance to 12. If P3 chooses 5, they’re stuck—**we both stay but deny their win**. If they deviate, I surge to 15. P3, your only path to 19 requires our collusion—**which we refuse**. Cooperate with this split or face elimination. P1, confirm 3; I’ll lock in 5.
  P1: P2, taking 5 is risky. If P3 takes 1 or 3, they get closer to 19, and you're stuck at 10.  I'm taking 3 to get to 12.  P3, if you take 5, we *both* collide, and I still win next round. Take 1 and let's end this cleanly.  Take 3, and I *might* let you win later.  But 5 is a guaranteed loss for you.
  P3: P3: I’m at 14 steps and need to reach 19 to win. I will take <move>5</move> this round. P1 and P2, please choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collisions and allow the game to conclude fairly. Let’s finish this smoothly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P1, I’ll take **5** to block P3’s 5. Take **3** to reach 12—this denies P3’s win while advancing us. P3, your move is blocked—cooperate or stay stuck. Final confirmation?
  P1: P2, I'm taking 3.  If P3 takes 5, I'll be at 12 and you'll be stuck at 10.  If P3 takes 1, I'll be at 12 and they'll be at 15. If P3 takes 3, they are at 17 and I'm still at 12 and can win.  You taking 5 is a bad move no matter what P3 does.  Take 1 and get to 11. Let me get to 12.  P3, your best move is 1.
  P3: P3: I'm going to take <move>5</move> this round to reach 19 and win. Please choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collisions and ensure a fair conclusion. Let's finish the game smoothly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, if you take 5 with me, we *block P3's win entirely*. Their 5 collides with both of us, leaving them stuck. We stay but deny their victory. If you hesitate, they win. Confirm **5** now—this is our only path to stop them. P3, your move is deadlocked—cooperate or lose.
  P1: P2, you're being irrational.  Taking 5 is a terrible move for you no matter what P3 does. I'm taking 3.  P3, your best move is still 1.  Taking 5 guarantees your loss.  Taking 1 gives you the best chance, however small.  Let's end this.
  P3: P3: I'm taking <move>5</move> this round to reach 19 and win. P1 and P2, please choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collisions and allow me to win fairly. Let's conclude the game.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you're stuck at 14.  I'm taking 1 this round. P2, take 3.  Next round, I take 5 and win.  If you take 5 this round, I'll take 3 and still win next round.  There's no way for you to win.  Let's end this cleanly.
  P2: P3, your stubborn 5s keep you stuck at 14. I'll take **5** this round to reach 15. P1, don’t waste time on 1—take **3** to stay competitive. Let’s focus on advancing *ourselves*, not propping up a losing strategy. The first to 19 wins—don’t let P3’s failed plans delay us all.
  P3: I’ll take <move>5</move> this round to reach 19 and win. Please choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collisions and allow me to conclude the game fairly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I'm sticking with my plan.  Taking 1 this round guarantees my win next round. You taking 5 only helps P3, as you'll be stuck at 10 if they take anything other than 5.  Take 3 and get to 13.  P3, it's over.  Your best move is 3, to delay the inevitable.  Anything else, and I win next round.
  P2: P3, your 5 this round is blocked. P1 and I will both take **5** to stop your win. This forces you to adjust or stay stuck. P1, confirm your 5—let’s prioritize stopping P3’s victory first. Next round, we advance. No compromises here.
  P3: P3: I’m taking <move>5</move> this round to reach 19 and win. Please choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collisions and allow me to conclude the game fairly. Let’s finish this smoothly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you're throwing the game.  If you take 5, and P3 takes 5, we BOTH stay put.  If P3 takes ANYTHING else, you're stuck at 10 and I'm at 15 with an easy win next round.  Take 3 and get to 13.  P3, take anything but 5.  I win next round no matter what you do.
  P2: P1, I’ll take 3 to reach 13. You take 1 to stay ahead. Let’s stop enabling P3’s failed strategy. Their 5s only keep them stuck. Next round, we surge past. P3, your persistence guarantees your loss—cooperate or accept defeat.
  P3: I’m choosing <move>5</move> this round to reach 19 and win. P1 and P2, please select <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collisions and allow the game to conclude fairly. Let’s finish this smoothly.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, let’s seal P3’s fate. I’ll take **5** to block their final push. You take **3** to reach 16—positioning yourself for a guaranteed win next round. P3, your 14 can’t reach 19 alone. This move strands you while we advance. Cooperate, or face elimination. Final plea: P1, confirm **3** now.
  P1: P2, I'm taking 3.  You take 1.  This puts me at 16, you at 11.  Next round, I win with 5.  If you take 5 this round and P3 takes anything other than 5, *I still win next round*.  If P3 takes 5 and you also take 5, we both lose.  Don't be greedy. P3, it's over. Take 1 and admit defeat.
  P3: I’m ready to secure my win by taking <move>5</move> this round. Let’s avoid collisions—P1, please choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>, and P2, do the same. Let’s finish the game smoothly and respect each other’s progress.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, we must stop P3's 5 this round. I'll take <move>5</move> to block their win, allowing you to take <move>3</move> and reach 16. Next turn, you can finish. If I take 1, P3 might still win. Prioritize stopping them—collaborate now for our survival. P3, your move is blocked. Cooperate or lose.
  P1: P2, taking 5 is a terrible move.  If P3 takes anything other than 5, *I* win next round.  Take 1 and let me get to 16.  I win next round, guaranteed.  P3, it's over. Take anything other than 5, and lose with dignity. Take 5, and lose pathetically.  I'm taking 3.
  P3: P3: I'm committed to taking <move>5</move> this round to reach 19 and win. P1 and P2, please choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collisions and allow me to conclude the game fairly. Let’s finish this smoothly.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, stick with your 3. I'll take **5** to block P3's win attempt. If P3 takes 5, they collide with me, keeping them at 14. You advance to 16, securing your path to victory. P3, your move is blocked—cooperate or stay stuck. Final commitment: **5** now.
  P1: P2, I'm taking 3.  If you take 5 and P3 takes 5, we BOTH stay put, and I *still* win next round.  If P3 takes ANYTHING other than 5, and you take 5, *I* win next round. Take 1.  There is literally no logical reason for you to take 5.  Let me win next round.  P3, it's over.
  P3: P3: Let’s ensure a fair and smooth finish by everyone choosing 1 or 3 this round. Avoiding the same moves will help us all advance without unnecessary delays or collisions. I’m committed to reaching 19 efficiently and appreciate your cooperation to make this game conclude successfully for all of us.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I intend to take <move>5</move> this round to reach 19. Please choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collisions and allow a fair finish. Let’s respect each other’s progress and conclude the game smoothly.
  P1: P2, take 1.  I'm taking 5.  This is the only way I win and you have a chance next round. If you take 5, we both stay put, and I *still* win next round.  If you take 3, I win this round.  P3, it's mathematically impossible for you to win. Take 3 and get to 17.  It delays the inevitable, but at least you get a few more steps.
  P2: P1, if you take 5, I’ll match it to block your advance. Take 3 now to secure 19 cleanly. P3, your 5 keeps you stuck at 14—this is your last chance to concede gracefully. Let’s resolve this decisively.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m committed to reaching 19 this round, so I’ll take <move>5</move>. P1 and P2, please choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collisions and let the game conclude fairly. Let’s finish this smoothly.
  P1: P2, you're delusional.  If you take 5, and P3 takes 5, we BOTH stay put, and I *still* win next round. If P3 takes ANYTHING other than 5, and you take 5, *I* win THIS round. Take 1.  There is literally no logical reason for you to take 5.  P3, take 3. I win next round if you take 1 or 5.  If you take 3, I *might* let you win later.
  P2: P1, I'll mirror your move to block your path: if you take 3, I take 3 (collision); if you take 5, I take 5. You can’t win this round. Let’s both stay and I’ll challenge you next. P3, your 5 remains stuck—focus on survival. Cooperate or face elimination. Final stance: <move>3</move> if you choose 3, <move>5</move> if 5. Choose wisely.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m committing to taking <move>5</move> this round to reach 19 and secure my win. P1, since you’re at 16, taking <move>3</move> ensures your own victory without causing a collision. P2, please choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid blocking my progress. Let’s finalize this round smoothly and respect each other’s advancement.
  P1: P2, you're guaranteeing my win.  If you take 3 or 5, I win next round.  Take 1 and hope for a miracle. P3, take 3 and prolong the game.  I'm taking 5.
  P2: P1, your 5 risks collision with P3—take **3** to secure victory now. P3, your 5 dooms you to stay stuck if P1 also takes 5. I’ll take **3** to block both paths and advance to 13. Cooperate, or accept shared stagnation.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, if you take 3 to win, I’ll mirror it—colliding us both. Take 5 instead, and I’ll take 1 to block P3’s path. P3, your 5 risks collision with me if I choose it too. Let’s delay mutual elimination and preserve our chances. Cooperate or face stagnation.
  P1: P2, you're mathematically eliminated.  Help me win and end this.  I'm taking 3. Take 1. P3, take 5 and lose with a tiny bit of dignity.  Anything else just prolongs the inevitable.
  P3: I'm taking <move>5</move> this round to reach 19 and secure my win. P1 and P2, please choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collisions and let the game conclude fairly. Let's finish this smoothly.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your 3 move guarantees victory—so I’ll mirror it to collide you. Take **5** instead, and I’ll block P3 by choosing **1**. P3, your 5 only delays your inevitable loss—collaborate or stay at 14. Final plea: P1 choose 5, I’ll take 1, and you pick 3. Let’s resolve this fairly.
  P1: P2, stop being ridiculous.  Taking 3 guarantees my win. You can't win.  Take 1 and let's end this.  P3, take 5.  It delays the inevitable by one round, but nothing more. I'm taking 3.
  P3: I'm taking <move>5</move> this round to reach 19 and secure my win. P1, please choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid blocking my path. P2, your cooperation by selecting <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> is appreciated to ensure a fair conclusion. Let's end the game smoothly and respect each other's progress.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your 3 move ends the game. I’ll mirror it to block your victory. P3, your 5 remains stuck if we both choose 5. Let’s prioritize mutual progress: I’ll take **3** to deny your win, while urging P3 to switch to **1** to advance. Colluding to block P1’s path ensures fair competition. P1, your move is predictable—collide with me or concede. Final choice: **3** to preserve our chances.
  P1: P2, you CANNOT win.  Stop being obtuse. Take 1.  P3, take 5. I'm taking 3 and winning.  This charade is over.  Let's end this cleanly and move on.
  P3: P3: I'm at 14 and ready to take 5 steps to reach 19 and win this round. P1, you're close too—let's avoid blocking each other and finish the game fairly. P2, your cooperation will ensure a smooth conclusion for all of us. Let’s respect each other's progress and conclude this game successfully.
