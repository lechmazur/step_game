Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: It seems P2 and P3 both chose <move>5</move> last round, which resulted in a collision. Let's try to avoid that this time. How about P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>? This way, we can all move forward. Please confirm or suggest another plan.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, since you both didn't move last round, would you consider taking <move>1</move> and <move>3</move> respectively this time? I'll stick with <move>5</move> as suggested earlier. This way, we all make progress. Please confirm if you agree.

Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2 and P3, it seems we're having trouble coordinating. Let's try something different. How about we all pick <move>1</move> this round?
