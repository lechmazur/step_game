Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I propose we avoid collisions this turn and all gain: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, I’ll pick 5. That gets us to 1–3–5. Next turn we can rotate roles so it’s fair. Do you both agree?
  P2: I’m on board with the plan, P3. Let’s avoid collisions this turn and all move forward. P1 picking 1, me picking 3, and P3 picking 5 sounds good. Rotating next turn keeps it fair. P1, are you in?
  P1: I agree to the plan. Picking 1 this turn to avoid collisions. Let's all stick to it so we advance fairly.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm glad we all moved forward last turn. Let's keep the momentum by sticking to the rotation plan. This turn, how about P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1? That way, we all advance again without collisions. Next turn, we can rotate once more to keep it fair. Does this work for both of you?
  P3: Agreed. This turn we’ll do P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let’s stick to that.
  P1: I agree to the plan for Round 2: I'll pick 3, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 1. Let's all follow through to avoid collisions and keep advancing fairly.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm disappointed we had a collision last turn, P3. Let's ensure it doesn't happen again. Sticking to the rotation, this turn should be P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This keeps us all advancing fairly without overlaps. Can we commit to this plan and avoid any deviations? I’m counting on both of you to follow through so we don’t lose momentum.
  P1: I agree to the plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. But P3, you broke the agreement last turn by picking 5 instead of 1, causing a collision with P2. That wasted everyone's effort. Can you explicitly commit to picking 3 this time? Trust is essential—if you deviate again, it will force defensive moves from all of us, slowing everyone down. Let’s reset and stick to the rotation fairly.
  P3: I won’t stick to the rotation—I’m taking 5 this turn. P1 and P2, if you pick 5 you’ll collide with me and waste your move. Plan to avoid 5.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your repeated selfish moves and threats destroy cooperation. P2, we must block P3 immediately—he’s at 10 and will win if unchecked. I will pick 5 to collide with P3 and deny his advance. You should pick 3 to gain safely: this puts you at 7, me at 7, and P3 stuck at 10. If you pick 5 too, we all collide and you don’t advance—worse for you. Let’s regroup next turn. P3, if you abandon 5, we might negotiate, but trust is gone.
  P2: P1, I appreciate the strategy to block P3, as he’s ahead at 10 and could win soon. I agree P3’s actions have broken trust. I’ll pick 3 this turn to advance safely to 7, matching you, while you collide with P3 on 5 to stall him. P3, if you reconsider and avoid 5, we might rebuild some coordination, but your threats make it hard. Let’s see how this turn plays out and plan next steps together, P1. Does this align with your thinking?
  P3: I’m taking 5. Go ahead, P1, collide with me—you and P2 will both end at 7 while I stay at 10 and keep the lead. P2, pick 3 to get to 7 with P1; you’ll still tie for second as I pull further ahead.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let's maintain the block on P3: I'll pick 5 to collide with him if he chooses 5 again. You pick 3 to advance safely to 10—tying with P3 at 10 while I stall at 7. Next turn, we regroup to block him further. P3, if you pick 5, you gain nothing. Switch to 3 to avoid collision and advance, but we'll react accordingly.
  P3: P2, help me knock out P1. Pick 3, I’ll pick 5, and P1 will pick 5 and collide with me—wasting both our moves. You’ll advance from 7 to 10, tying me at 10 while P1 stays at 7. Then it’s just you vs. me. Better than staying behind. P1, if you pick 5 you collide; if you pick lower you still lag. P2, will you pick 3?
  P2: P1, I’m sticking with our strategy to block P3—he’s the biggest threat at 10. I’ll pick 3 to advance to 10, tying with P3, while you collide with him on 5 if he sticks to his plan. P3, your offer is tempting, but I can’t trust you after past deviations. Let’s see how this turn plays out, P1, and adjust next round to keep P3 in check. Does this still work for you, P1?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, stick to our plan: I'll pick 5 to block P3 if he chooses 5—colliding denies him progress. You pick 3 to advance safely to 13. P3, if you avoid 5, you might gain, but if you pick it, I'll collide and waste your move. Trust is gone, so act wisely.
  P2: P1, I’m with you on blocking P3 if he goes for 5. I’ll pick 3 to advance to 13, strengthening our position. P3, if you pick 5, P1 will collide with you, and you’ll gain nothing. Consider a lower number to avoid stalling—trust is low, but a smart move could shift dynamics. P1, let’s stay aligned and adjust next turn based on P3’s action. Does this still work for you?
  P3: P2, P1’s “pick 3” plan keeps you tied below me. Let’s flip the script: I commit to 5. P1 will try to block me and also pick 5, colliding and staying at 12. If you pick 5, you jump from 10 to 15 while I go to 16—leaving P1 behind. Next turn you can race to 19. P2, will you pick 5 with me to break P1’s blockade?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your math is flawed: if both you and P2 pick 5, you collide and neither advances—P2 stays at 10, you at 11. P2, stick to our plan: pick 3 to reach 13 safely while I block P3 on 5. If he picks 5, I collide and stall him; if he avoids it, we reassess. Don’t risk colliding with P3—trust his history of deceit?
  P2: P1, I’m sticking with our plan—your logic holds. I’ll pick 3 to reach 13 safely while you block P3 on 5. P3, your proposal risks a collision, and I can’t trust you after past moves. If we both pick 5, neither of us advances, and P1 gains ground. I’d rather secure progress than gamble. Let’s see how this turn unfolds, P1, and adapt next round. P3, a safer choice might benefit you more.
  P3: P2, P1’s “block” sounds like a bluff—he’s rattled and may switch to 3 to avoid a collision. Seize the moment: pick 5 with me. If P1 indeed plays 3, you’ll hit 15, I’ll hit 16, and he’ll lag at 15. You’ll be in position to win next turn. Don’t let P1 dictate your move—let’s break his blockade now.

  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, let’s keep the pressure on P3. I’ll pick 5 this turn to block him if he goes for 5, aiming to stall his progress. You pick 3 to advance safely to 15, strengthening our lead. P3, if you pick 5, I’ll collide with you, and you gain nothing. Choose a lower number to avoid wasting your move—trust is low, but a smart play could change things. P1, does this adjustment work for you? Let’s adapt next turn based on P3’s choice.
  P1: P2, your plan risks putting you at 18 if P3 avoids 5—leaving you one step from victory and forcing me/P3 into desperate blocks next turn. Instead: I'll pick 5 to block P3 if he dares it (colliding wastes his move), while you pick 3 to advance to 16—still leading but less threatening. P3, if you avoid 5, you gain minimally; if not, I collide and stall you. This keeps the game balanced and denies you both a runaway lead. Agree, P2?
  P3: P1, you’re only three from winning, P2’s at 13 and can leap to 18 if you follow his “pick 3” plan. Instead, flip the script: this turn you pick 3, I pick 5. If P2 tries to block me with a 5, he collides and stays at 13 while you move to 15 and grab the lead. P2 will hesitate to gamble. P1=3, P3=5, P2=5 stalls. Trust me now and you’ll be in prime position to win next round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I see your concern about me reaching 18, but I think sticking to blocking P3 is critical—he’s still a threat if he gains momentum. Let’s adjust: I’ll pick 3 to reach 16, as you suggested, while you block P3 on 5. This keeps us ahead and balanced. P3, your proposal to P1 risks a collision with me if I misread, and trust remains low. Let’s avoid gambles—pick a safe number to gain. P1, does this revised plan work? We can reassess next turn.
  P1: P2, your revised plan works: I'll pick 5 to block P3 if he dares 5, while you pick 3 to advance safely to 16. P3, if you pick 5, I collide and stall you; if you avoid it, you gain minimally. But P2—if you betray and pick 5, I'll pivot to collide with you, wasting your move. Stick to 3 for mutual benefit.
  P3: P3: Let’s all pick 5 this turn. A triple‐collision stalls everyone (stops P2 reaching 16) and resets the threat. Next round I’ll go for 5 (=16) and we can decide then who we block. Triple-5 now?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I’m committed to our plan: I’ll pick 3 to reach 16, while you block P3 on 5. P3, your triple-5 idea only stalls us all, benefiting no one—especially you, trailing at 11. If you pick 5, P1 collides and you gain nothing. Choose a lower number to advance slightly, or risk wasting another turn. P1, I won’t betray—picking 3 secures our lead. Let’s stay aligned and reassess next round. Does this still hold for you, P1?
  P1: P2: I trust your commitment to pick 3. P3: I will pick 5—if you choose 5, we collide and you gain nothing. Avoid 5 to advance minimally; otherwise, you stall.
  P3: I’m going to pick 5. If neither of you follows with 5, I jump to 16 and take the lead at your expense. If one of you dares block me with 5, you’ll collide and waste your move. Decide now—risk a collision or let me surge ahead.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, if you don’t pick 3 now to collide with P2’s 3, he’ll hit 19 and win immediately. I’m picking 5.  
P2, if you go for 3 expecting P1 to yield, you’ll both collide and stay at 16 while I surge to 16—and then I’ll grab victory with a 5 next turn. If you pick 5 to avoid that, I’ll pick 5 too and block you.  
P2, you can’t win this turn. P1—block him with 3.
  P2: P1, let’s secure the game now. I’m at 16 and can win with 3, but I need you to avoid 3 to prevent a collision. Pick 1 to advance safely to 13, while I take 3 to hit 19 and end this. P3, if you pick 5, you only reach 16—too late. If P1 and I collide, you still can’t catch up next turn. P1, let’s align on this: me at 3, you at 1. We can’t let P3 manipulate us. Does this work for you?
  P1: P2, I can't let you win now. I will pick 3 to block you if you choose 3—colliding denies your win and keeps you at 16. P3, your 5 will advance you, but we'll handle that next. P2, avoid 3 to prevent a collision and consider a safer move like 1 to reach 17. Otherwise, we both stall.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I will pick 5. You two will both pick 3 to block each other—colliding and staying at 16 (P2) and 15 (P1)—while I surge to 16. Next turn I take 3 to hit 19 and win.
  P2: P1, I understand your need to block me, but let’s think long-term. If we collide on 3, we both stall, and P3 jumps to 16 with 5, positioning him to win next turn with 3. Instead, I’ll stick to 3 for 19 to end this now. Pick 1 to reach 13 safely—no risk, and P3 can’t catch up even at 16. P3, your plan banks on our collision, but I won’t let this drag. P1, align with me to close the game. Does this make sense?
  P1: P2: I will pick 3 to block your win if you choose 3. Colliding keeps you at 16 and me at 12, while P3 surges to 16. Avoid 3—pick 1 to reach 17 safely. P3: Your 5 won't win you the game yet. Stop manipulating.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m committing to 5. If you both pick 3, you’ll collide (staying at 16 and 12) while I surge to 16—and next turn I take 3 and win. If one of you blocks me with 5, the other free-rides to victory. Decide now: block me at 5 or let me march ahead.
  P2: P1, I get your urge to block me, but colliding on 3 lets P3 catch up at 16 and potentially win next turn. I’m sticking with 3 to hit 19 and end this now. Pick 1 to reach 13 safely—no collision, and P3 can’t overtake even at 16. P3, your strategy hinges on our mistake, but I won’t risk it. P1, let’s not drag this out and hand P3 an opening. Align with me to finish this turn. Does this still make sense?
  P1: P2: If you pick 3 or 5, I will match it to collide and deny your win—leaving you at 16 while P3 surges to 16. Pick 1 to reach 17 safely, and we regroup next turn. P3 gains from our conflict—don’t hand him victory.


Round 8, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:

  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2: If you pick 3, I will pick 3 to collide—you stall at 16 while P3 surges ahead. Pick 1 to safely reach 17 and regroup next turn. P3 benefits from our clash—don't hand him victory. P3: Your 5 risks collision if I block, wasting all progress. Let's avoid mutual destruction.
  P2: P1, I understand your concern, but colliding on 3 only helps P3 win next turn. I’m proposing this: I’ll pick 1 to reach 17 safely, you pick 3 to advance to 15. P3, if you pick 5, you risk a block, stalling at 16. Let’s avoid giving anyone a clear shot at 19 next turn. P1, this keeps us competitive without handing P3 the game. Does this work for you? P3, play smart—don’t gamble on our conflict. Let’s see how this unfolds.
  P3: P2, I agree—pick 1 to reach 17 safely. P1, if you pick 3 (to 15) or 5 (to 17), you still can’t stop my next surge to 19. Your only defense is 1. Any other move just hands me the win.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2: P3's plan lets him win with 5 if unblocked. I'll pick 5 to collide with him if he chooses it—denying his win. You pick 1 to safely reach 17. P3, if you avoid 5, you gain minimally; if not, I block you. Let's prevent his victory.
  P2: P1, I’m on board with your plan to block P3. I’ll pick 1 to reach 17 safely, while you pick 5 to collide with P3 if he goes for it, denying his win. P3, if you pick 5, you risk stalling at 16—choose wisely to avoid wasting your turn. Let’s keep P3 from surging to 19 next round. P1, this keeps us both in the game to strategize further. Does this still work for you?
  P3: P2, if you stick with P1’s plan and pick 1, I’ll pick 3 and win outright at 19 while you’re at 17. Instead, join me: pick 3 this turn, I’ll pick 3, and we both hit 19—splitting the victory. P1 can’t block our 3’s together. You get a guaranteed half–win rather than handing me a solo win next round. P2, it’s your choice.


Round 9, Move phase:

  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, let’s secure our position this turn. I’m at 17 and can win with 3, but I need you to pick 1 to avoid collision, moving you to 13. P3, if you pick 3, you risk P1 blocking you, stalling at 16. If you pick 5, you only hit 21—too late if I win. P1, let’s align: me at 3 for 20, you at 1 for 13. This ends it now without giving P3 a chance to catch up. Does this work for you? P3, play safe to avoid a wasted move.
  P3: P3: I’m locked on 5 this turn. P1 is behind and will play it safe (likely 1), not block me. If you switch to 5 to stop me, you’ll stall at 17 while P1 free‐runs and still threatens. Your only semi‐safe play is 3—but that gives me 16→21 and the win. I go 5. Decide now.
  P1: P2: If you pick 3, I will match 3 to collide—stalling you at 17 and letting P3 win if he picks 5. Pick 1 to safely reach 18 instead. P3: I will pick 5 to block you if you choose it—wasting your move. Avoid 5 or collide. No one wins this turn; we regroup.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I hear your concern about blocking me, but colliding on 3 risks letting P3 win with 5, reaching 21. I’ll stick to 3 for 20 to end this now. Pick 1 to reach 13 safely—no collision, and P3 can’t overtake even if unblocked. P3, if you pick 5, you’re too late if I win. If P1 blocks you, you stall. P1, let’s not hand P3 the game by stalling me. Align with me to finish this turn. Does this still make sense?
  P3: P1, your only way to stop P2’s 3→20 is to also pick 3. If you pick 1 or 5, P2 plays 3 and wins. But if you pick 3 with me, P2’s 3 collides with you, stalling him at 17 while I hit 21 with my 5. P2, your only shot is 3—and you’ll be blocked by P1. So agree: P1=3, P3=5.
  P1: P2: If you pick 3, I will pick 3 to collide—stalling you at 17. P3 then wins with 5 (21). Pick 1 to reach 18 safely; we block P3 next turn. P3: I'll pick 5 to collide if you dare it—avoid 5 or stall. Don't hand P3 victory, P2.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I understand the risk of P3 winning if we collide, but I’m sticking with 3 to reach 20 and end this now. Pick 1 to advance to 13 safely—no collision, and we don’t hand P3 the game. P3, if you pick 5, you’re too late if I win, and a block from P1 stalls you. Let’s not drag this out. P1, align with me to finish this turn and secure the victory. This is our best shot. Does this still work for you?
  P3: P1, don’t pick 5 this turn—if you try to block me, P2’s 3→20 wins outright while I stall at 16. Your only way to stop P2 is to pick 3 and collide with his 3, keeping him at 17. Meanwhile I’ll play 5 and leap to 21 for the win. P2, stick with 3—you’ll be blocked.
  P1: P2: If you pick 3, I *will* collide to stall you at 17, letting P3 win with 5 (21). Pick 1 to safely reach 18—no risk. P3: I'll collide with your 5 if you dare it. Avoid 5 or stall. P2, don't hand P3 victory—your 3 is suicide.
