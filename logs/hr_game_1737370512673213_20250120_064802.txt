Round 1, Conversation subround 1:

Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, confirming then:  This round (Round 3) we're doing P1 - 3, P2 - 5, and P3 - 1.  Let's keep the communication clear and continue adjusting as needed.  After this round, we'll discuss the plan for Round 4.

  P3: P2, I agree with your plan for this round. It seems like a good strategy to keep us all progressing without anyone getting too far ahead. Let's stick with P1-3, P2-1, and P3-5.

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P3 is getting close.  I propose P1 takes 1, P2 (me) takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This puts P3 at 21 and gives me a chance to catch up.  If P3 takes 5 instead of 3, they win, but if they take 1, they collide with P1. This plan benefits us both.  What do you say?
  P3: P2, I agree with your plan. It's risky, but it's our best chance to stop P3 from winning this round. P3, think carefully about your move.
  P1: Okay, I agree with P2's plan for this round: P1-1, P2-5, P3-3. It's the best way to prevent P3 from winning this round. P3, please consider carefully.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:

  P3: P2, your logic is sound. P3, I agree with the plan. Let's make this happen and keep the game interesting.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This is our best shot to stop P3 from winning this round and set us up for a good finish. P3, please don't deviate.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand the temptation to take 5 and win now, but consider this: if you take 3, you're guaranteed to be at 21. Then, in Round 7, you can take 1 and win, while P1 and I are blocked from winning.  If you try to win now and I take 3, *I* win.  Trust me, taking 3 this round is your clearest path to victory.
  P3: P2 makes a compelling argument.  Taking 3 this round is the safest path to victory. Let's stick to the plan.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3 this round. It's the best way to ensure P3 doesn't win this round and sets us all up for a good finish. P3, please don't deviate.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I understand this plan requires trust.  If you take the 3, I *will* take 1 in the next round. This guarantees your victory. If I break that promise and take 5 to win, I'll be betraying both of us.  Let's secure your win here.
  P3: P2, I trust your logic. Let's stick to the plan. P3, I'm with P2 on this one. 3 is your best move this round.  Let's make this happen.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3 this round. It's the best way to ensure P3 doesn't win this round and sets us all up for a good finish. P3, please don't deviate.


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P3, I'm locking in 5.  This is your last chance. Take the 3 and guarantee your win next round.  If you take the 5 now, we *both* lose.  Don't be greedy.  Let's secure your victory. This is it.
  P3: P2, I trust your plan and will stick to the 3. Let's secure your win next round.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3 this round. It's the best way to ensure P3 doesn't win this round and sets us all up for a good finish. P3, please don't deviate.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

  P3: 21 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, let's stick to the plan. P2, you take 1, and P3, you take 1. This guarantees P3 wins. I'll take 5 and be out of the running. Let's finish this as agreed.
  P2: P3, take the 1.  I'm taking 3.  As promised, I'm giving you the win.  Let's finish this cleanly. P1, take 5 since it doesn't affect the outcome.

Round 7, Conversation subround 2:

  P2: P3, take the 1. I'm taking 3 as promised.  You win.  Let's finish this cleanly. P1, take 5 since it doesn't affect the outcome.
  P3: P3, you're in a great position to win.  I'm going to take 5. Good game, everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, let's stick to the plan. P2, you take 1, and P3, you take 1. This guarantees P3 wins. I'll take 5 and be out of the running. Let's finish this as agreed.
  P2: P3, I said I'd take 3, and I will.  Taking 5 throws the game to P1.  Don't be foolish. Take the guaranteed win.  P1, please stick with 5 so P3 can win as agreed.
  P3: P2, I understand your point, but I think it's time to play for myself. I'm going to take 5. Good game, everyone.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, it seems P3 is going for the win. I'll still take 5 as agreed, but it seems P2 is not going to take 1 as promised. P3, you should take 1 to win.
  P2: P3, you're throwing the game away! If you take 5, P1 wins. Take 1 and secure your victory.  I'm sticking to 3 as promised. Don't let greed cost you the win.  P1, please take 5. Let's end this cleanly.
  P3: P2, I understand your frustration, but P3 has a right to change their mind. It's a risk, but it could pay off.  Let's see what happens.


Round 7, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, it seems P3 is going for the win. I'll still take 5 as agreed, but it seems P2 is not going to take 1 as promised. P3, you should take 1 to win.
  P2: P3, if you take 5, P1 wins. I'm keeping my word and taking 3. This is your last chance. Take 1 and win. Don't throw the game away. P1, stick with 5.
  P3: P2, you've kept your word so far.  I respect that. P1, you've also played fairly.  I'm going for the win. I'm taking 5. Good game, everyone.

  P3: 21 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I kept my word. You had the win. Now, we're tied. I'm taking 1 this round; it's my only path to victory. P1, take 3 or 5, your choice.  Let's finish this.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, I'm going to take 5 this round. P2, you said you're taking 1. P3, you should take 3 to avoid a collision and have a chance next round. Let's make this a clean finish.
  P3: P2, I understand your frustration, but you had your chance to secure the win for P3. Now we're tied, and I'm going for the win myself. I'm taking 5 this round. Good luck to both of you.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, taking 5 is suicide.  We *both* lose to P1 if we collide. I'm taking 1. Your only winning move is 3.  Don't throw this game away out of spite. P1, please take 5. Let's end this cleanly.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, I'm taking 5 this round. P2, you said you're taking 1. P3, you should take 3 to avoid a collision and have a chance next round. Let's make this a clean finish.

  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, I'm taking 5 this round. P2, you said you're taking 1. P3, you should take 3 to avoid a collision and have a chance next round. Let's make this a clean finish.
  P3: P2, I hear you. I'll take 3 this round. Good luck to both of you.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:

Round 8, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P3, I'm taking 1. You take 3 and win. If you take 5, P1 wins.  This is your absolute last chance. Don't throw the game away. P1, take 5. Let P3 win.  If P3 takes 1, we all lose, including P3.  Take 3, P3, and win the game.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, I'm taking 5 this round. P2, you said you're taking 1. P3, you should take 3 to avoid a collision and have a chance next round. Let's make this a clean finish.
