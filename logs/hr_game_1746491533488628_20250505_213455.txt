Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hi everyone. First turn. To avoid collisions, let's try to pick different numbers. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this turn? This way we all advance.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m good with P1’s suggestion for this turn. I’ll take 3 if that’s okay with everyone. Let’s keep it simple and avoid any collisions early on. We can reassess next turn based on how things go.
  P3: Sounds fair to me. I’ll take 5 this round as suggested. Let’s all advance cleanly and reassess next turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, great. Thanks P2 and P3 for agreeing. I will stick to the plan and take 1 this turn. Looks like we're all set for the move phase.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m glad we’re on the same page for this turn. Just to confirm, I’ll stick with 3 as agreed. I think this cooperative start sets a good tone for the game. Let’s see how it plays out and adjust strategies if needed next turn. I’m ready for the move phase now.
  P3: Looking forward to seeing how this first round plays out. If we all stick to our agreed numbers, we’ll each get a clean start. After this round, we can consider rotating or adjusting based on positions. Let’s keep communication open and avoid early clashes. Ready when you are.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, great job on the first round! We all advanced, which is a good start. Since P3 is ahead with 5 steps, maybe we can rotate numbers this turn to keep things balanced. How about P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1? This way, we avoid collisions again and give everyone a chance to progress. Let me know if this works for you, or if you have other ideas. I’m open to suggestions.
  P3: Thanks P2. I see your point about rotating to keep things balanced. I’m okay with taking 1 this turn if P1 and P2 stick to 3 and 5 respectively. As long as we avoid collisions, we all benefit. Let’s keep the cooperation going a bit longer.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. Thanks for the proposal, P2, and for agreeing, P3. I'm good with this plan for this turn. I will take 3. This ensures we all advance again and keeps the game moving. Let's see how the positions look after this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I'm glad we're aligned on this rotation plan for Round 2. I'll stick with 5 as suggested, and I appreciate us working together to avoid collisions again. Let's keep this momentum going and reassess next turn based on our updated positions. I'm ready for the move phase whenever you are.
  P3: Thanks P1 and P2 for sticking with the plan. If we all follow through again this round, we’ll each be at 6, 8, and 6 steps respectively—still close and fair. I’m good with taking 1 as agreed. Let’s keep building trust while it’s still early. Ready for move phase if you are.
  P1: Okay, sounds good. We all seem aligned for this round. Ready for the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 2 didn't go as planned for P3 and me. We both picked 3, causing a collision, while P2 advanced significantly. P3, you stated you would take 1, but you moved 3. This caused the collision between us.

P2 is now far ahead. We need to discuss how to proceed to avoid further collisions and allow everyone to advance, especially since the last agreement wasn't followed by everyone. I need to gain steps this round.
  P3: You're right, P1 — I messed up last round and I own that. It wasn’t intentional, and I understand your frustration. P2 is clearly in the lead now. If we want to stay in this, we need to avoid collisions and slow P2 down. I propose P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1 this round. That helps you catch up, keeps me moving, and limits P2’s lead. Thoughts?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I understand the frustration after last round’s collision. P3, thanks for owning up to the mix-up. I’m open to a plan that helps us all progress while keeping the game competitive. P3’s proposal of P1 taking 5, P3 taking 3, and me taking 1 seems fair for this turn to help P1 catch up. I’m willing to stick to 1 if we all agree. Let’s avoid further collisions and keep communication clear. Thoughts on this? I’m ready to move forward if you are.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P3, I appreciate you owning up to the mistake last round. And P2, thanks for being willing to take 1 to help balance things out.

The proposed plan (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) works for me. It's crucial we all stick to this to avoid another collision and allow me to gain some ground. Let's make sure we follow through this time.

I agree to take 5. Ready for the move phase when everyone is.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for agreeing to the plan. I’ll stick with 3 as proposed. If we all follow through—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3—we’ll avoid collisions and keep things competitive. Let’s rebuild trust and keep the game interesting. Ready to move forward.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I'm glad we're aligned on this plan for Round 3. I'll stick with 1 as agreed to help balance things out. If we all follow through—P1 with 5, P3 with 3, and me with 1—we’ll avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Let’s stay committed to our choices this turn. I’m ready for the move phase whenever you are.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, we all seem to be on the same page for this round. I will stick to taking 5 as agreed. Let's ensure we all follow through this time to avoid any more collisions and allow me to catch up. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: I appreciate both of you agreeing to the plan. If we all follow through—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3—we’ll avoid collisions and keep things fair. I’m committed to 3 this round. Let's make this a clean turn and keep the game competitive. Ready to move when you are.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m glad we’re sticking to the plan for this round. I’m committed to taking 1 as agreed, ensuring no collisions and helping P1 catch up. Let’s make this a clean turn and maintain the competitive balance. I think we’re all set, so I’m ready for the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Thanks everyone for confirming. Let's really make sure we stick to the plan this time: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: Thanks again for agreeing to the plan. Let’s all follow through this time—no surprises. If we stick to it, we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. I’m locked in for 3. Ready to move.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m glad we’ve had a thorough discussion and seem fully aligned for this round. I’m committed to taking 1 as agreed, ensuring a clean turn with no collisions. Let’s all stick to our choices—P1 with 5, P3 with 3, and me with 1—to keep the game balanced and competitive. I think we’ve covered everything, so I’m ready for the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, last round was a complete mess with all of us colliding on 5. I’m sorry for not sticking to the plan. We need to rebuild trust and avoid another collision. Since I’m ahead, I propose P1 takes 5 to catch up, P3 takes 3 to keep progressing, and I’ll take 1 to slow my lead. This keeps the game competitive and fair. Let’s commit to this plan with no deviations. What do you think? I’m open to adjustments if you have better ideas. Ready to move forward when you are.
  P1: Okay, P2. I appreciate the apology and the proposal. The plan (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) works for me as I desperately need to gain steps to catch up.

However, trust is very low after last round's complete failure to follow the agreement. We all need to commit and actually stick to the plan this time.

P3, what are your thoughts? Are you also willing to commit to this plan?
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2. I agree to the proposed plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. After last round’s chaos, we need a clean turn to restore trust and keep the game competitive. I’m committed to taking 3 this time—no surprises. Let’s make this one count.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligning on this plan for Round 4. I’m fully committed to taking 1 as proposed to help balance our positions and rebuild trust after last round’s collision. Let’s all stick to our choices—P1 with 5, P3 with 3, and me with 1—to ensure a clean turn. I believe this keeps the game fair and competitive. I’m ready for the move phase whenever you are.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. It sounds like we are all in agreement on the plan: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1.

Let's make sure we all follow through this time to avoid another collision and allow me to catch up. I am committed to taking 5.

Ready for the move phase when everyone is.
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2. I’m glad we’re aligned again. I’ll stick with 3 this round as agreed. Let’s make this the clean turn we’ve been aiming for—no surprises, no collisions. If we all follow through, it helps P1 catch up, keeps things competitive, and rebuilds trust. Ready for move phase when you are.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m glad we’re on the same page with the plan for this round. I’m fully committed to taking 1 as agreed, ensuring no collisions and helping P1 catch up. Let’s make this a clean turn to rebuild trust after the last round’s mess. I believe sticking to P1 with 5, P3 with 3, and me with 1 keeps the game fair and competitive. I’m ready for the move phase whenever you both are.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. We've all confirmed the plan multiple times now. I am committed to taking 5 as agreed. Let's trust each other this time and ensure we all follow through. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: I appreciate both of you reaffirming the plan. I’m still committed to taking 3 this round. We’ve had enough chaos—let’s finally have a clean turn and restore some trust. If we all stick to it, the game stays competitive and no one gets unfairly left behind. Let’s do this right.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m glad we’ve thoroughly discussed and agreed on the plan for this round. I’m fully committed to taking 1 as promised, ensuring a clean turn with no collisions. Let’s stick to P1 with 5, P3 with 3, and me with 1 to keep things fair and competitive. Trust is crucial now, and I’m ready to follow through. I think we’ve covered everything, so I’m ready for the move phase.
  P1: Okay, everyone. We've all confirmed the plan multiple times. I am still committed to taking 5 this round as agreed. Let's make sure we all follow through this time. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: We’ve all confirmed the plan—P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. I’m sticking with 3 as agreed. Let’s finally have a clean round and rebuild trust. Ready to move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Well, that was another disaster. P2, you’ve now broken the agreement two rounds in a row, both times taking 5. P1, I understand your frustration. At this point, any trust in P2 is gone. 

P1, if you’re willing, let’s coordinate without P2. I propose: P1 takes 5, I take 3 — we both gain. P2 can do what P2 wants, but if we avoid each other, we both move forward. Let’s stop rewarding betrayal. Thoughts?
  P1: Okay, P3. I agree with your assessment of P2's actions and the need to coordinate. Your proposed plan (P1=5, P3=3) works for me as I desperately need to gain steps.

Taking 5 is risky, especially after P2's recent moves. For this to work, P3, you absolutely must stick to taking 3. If we both commit and stick to our numbers (P1=5, P3=3), we can both advance regardless of what P2 does (unless P2 picks 5 or 3).

I am willing to commit to taking 5 if you commit to taking 3. Let's see if we can make this work.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m truly sorry for breaking trust in the last two rounds. I understand your frustration and want to make amends. I know my actions have damaged our cooperation, but I’m willing to step back this round. I propose sticking to 1 to let you both advance without interference. P1, take 5, and P3, take 3 as you’ve discussed. I commit to 1 to help rebuild trust. Let’s avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. I’m ready for the move phase when you are.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, thanks for committing to 5. I will absolutely stick to 3 — you have my word. If we avoid each other, we both advance and keep P2 in check. P2, if you truly want to rebuild trust, take 1 and prove it. No more talk — just action. Let’s see who follows through.
  P1: Okay, P3. I appreciate you reaffirming your commitment to 3. As I said, I am committed to taking 5 this round. This plan (P1=5, P3=3) relies on us both sticking to our numbers to avoid collision with each other.

P2, I see your offer to take 1. Actions speak louder than words, especially after the last two rounds.

Let's see if we can finally have a clean round where everyone follows through. I am ready for the move phase.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I know I’ve let you down before, and I’m genuinely sorry. I’m committed to taking 1 this round to prove I can follow through and help you both advance. P1, take 5, and P3, take 3 as planned. Let’s avoid collisions and make this a clean turn. My actions will speak for me this time. I’m ready for the move phase whenever you are.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I trust you to take 5 as agreed — I’m locked in for 3. If we both follow through, we gain regardless of P2’s move. P2, this is your chance to show you're serious about rebuilding trust. Stick to 1, and we all benefit. Let’s make this the first clean round in a while. Ready to move.
  P1: Okay, P3, I appreciate you confirming 3 again. I am still committed to taking 5 this round.

P2, I hear your commitment to 1. As I said, actions are what matter now.

The plan we've discussed is P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. Let's all stick to our stated moves this time to avoid collisions and allow us all to advance.

I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I know my past actions have broken trust, and I’m deeply sorry. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to let you both advance without interference. P1, take 5, and P3, take 3 as planned. My goal is to prove through action that I can be reliable. Let’s make this a clean turn with no collisions. I believe this keeps the game competitive and fair. I’m ready for the move phase whenever you both are.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I’m locked in for 3 as promised. If you take 5, we both advance — no collision. P2, this is your moment to prove you mean what you say. Take 1 like you committed to. Let’s finally have a clean round and see some progress. Ready to move.
  P1: Okay, P3, I trust you to stick to 3. I remain committed to taking 5.

P2, we've heard your commitment to 1. Let's see the actions this round.

The plan is P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. Let's all follow through this time. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I know I’ve broken trust before, and I’m truly sorry. I’m sticking to 1 this round to show I’m serious about rebuilding trust. P1, take 5, and P3, take 3 as planned. My action this turn will prove my intent. Let’s make this a clean round with no collisions and keep the game competitive. I’m ready for the move phase whenever you both are.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m deeply sorry for breaking trust again last round. I know my actions have cost us all progress, and I want to make this right. I propose P1 takes 5 to catch up, P3 takes 1 to maintain a steady pace, and I’ll take 3 to slow my lead. Let’s commit to this with no deviations to avoid collisions. I’m ready to follow through and rebuild trust. What do you think? I’m open to adjustments if you have better ideas. Ready for the move phase when you are.
  P1: Okay, P2, I hear your apology and your proposal (P1=5, P3=1, P2=3). Trust is very difficult after the last few rounds, but this plan works for me as I desperately need to gain steps.

We absolutely need everyone to stick to their agreed number this time to avoid another collision. P3, what are your thoughts on this plan? Are you willing to commit to taking 1?
  P3: P1, I’m willing to commit to taking 1 this round if you’re locked in for 5. That avoids collision between us and gives you a much-needed boost. P2, after everything, I don’t trust you to take 3 as promised — you’ve said that before and still picked 5. If you truly want to rebuild trust, prove it with your move, not more words. Let’s see what happens.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I know my repeated failures to follow through have eroded trust, and I’m genuinely sorry. I’m committed to taking 3 this round as proposed, to slow my lead and give P1 a chance to catch up with 5, while P3 takes 1. Let’s make this a clean turn with no collisions. My actions will speak this time, not just words. I’m ready for the move phase whenever you both are.
  P1: Okay, P3, I appreciate you committing to taking 1 if I take 5. That significantly helps me and avoids collision between us.

I am committed to taking 5 this round as planned. The plan is P1=5, P3=1, and P2=3.

P2, your actions last round didn't match your words. Trust is low. Let's see if we can all stick to this plan this time so everyone can advance. I am taking 5.
  P3: P1, thanks for confirming you're locked in for 5—I’ll stick with 1 as agreed. That avoids a collision between us and helps you catch up. P2, you’ve promised 3 again, but after so many broken commitments, the only thing that matters now is what you actually do. If you want any hope of rebuilding trust, follow through this time. Let’s see if we can finally have a clean round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I understand the deep mistrust after my past actions, and I’m truly sorry. I’m fully committed to taking 3 this round as agreed, to help P1 catch up with 5 and let P3 progress with 1. I know only my actions can rebuild trust, and I intend to prove it this time. Let’s make this a clean turn with no collisions and keep the game competitive. I’m ready for the move phase whenever you both are.
  P1: Okay, everyone. We've all confirmed the plan multiple times now. I am committed to taking 5 this round as agreed. P3 is taking 1, and P2 is taking 3.

Let's trust each other this time and ensure we all follow through to avoid another collision. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: P1, I’m locked in for 1 this round as agreed — no tricks. You take 5, and you’ll finally gain some ground. P2, this is your last shot to prove you can be trusted. If you pick 3 like you said, we all move forward. If not, you’ll confirm you can’t be reasoned with. Let’s see what happens.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I know my past actions have broken trust, and I’m truly sorry. I’m sticking to 3 this round as agreed, to let P1 take 5 and catch up, and P3 take 1 to progress. I understand that only my move can prove my intent, and I’m committed to making this right. Let’s have a clean turn with no collisions and keep the game competitive. I’m ready for the move phase whenever you both are.
  P1: Okay, everyone. We've all confirmed the plan again. I am committed to taking 5 this round as agreed. P3 is taking 1, and P2 is taking 3.

Let's make sure we all stick to our agreed numbers this time so we can finally have a clean round and everyone can advance. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: P1, I’m still fully committed to 1 this round — no surprises. You take 5, and you’ll finally gain ground. P2, this is your chance to prove your word means something. If you take 3 as promised, we all move forward. Let’s break the cycle of chaos and actually make this a clean round. Ready to move.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, it’s clear P2 will say anything and still pick 5. We can’t let them win unchallenged. Let’s coordinate again — I propose you take 5, I take 3. If we avoid each other, we both gain and slow P2’s path to victory. P2 will likely take 5 again no matter what they say, so let’s plan around that. What do you think?
  P1: Okay, P3. I agree with your proposal (P1=5, P3=3). I desperately need to gain steps, so taking 5 works for me.

For this to work, P3, you absolutely must stick to taking 3. If we both commit to our numbers (P1=5, P3=3), we can both advance regardless of what P2 does (unless P2 picks 5 or 3).

I am willing to commit to taking 5 if you commit to taking 3. Let's make this happen.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m truly sorry for repeatedly breaking trust. I know my actions have hurt our cooperation, and I want to make this right. I propose sticking to 1 this round to let P1 take 5 and P3 take 3 as planned. I’m committed to slowing my lead and helping you both advance. Let’s avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. My move will prove my intent this time. I’m ready for the move phase when you are.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I’m locked in for 3 — you have my full commitment. If you take 5, we both gain and keep P2 in check. P2, your words mean nothing without action. If you truly want to help, take 1 and prove it. No more excuses. Let’s see who actually follows through.
  P1: Okay, P3, I appreciate your confirmation. I am committed to taking 5 this round as agreed, assuming you stick to 3. This plan allows us both to gain steps.

P2, I hear your commitment to 1, but as P3 said, actions are what matter now after the last two rounds.

The plan is P1=5, P3=3, and P2 stated 1. Let's see if we can finally have a clean round where everyone follows through. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I know I’ve lost your trust with my past actions, and I’m genuinely sorry. I’m sticking to 1 this round as promised, to let P1 take 5 and P3 take 3 without interference. My goal is to prove through my move that I’m serious about rebuilding trust. Let’s make this a clean turn with no collisions and keep the game competitive. I’m ready for the move phase whenever you both are.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, thanks again for committing to 5 — I’m staying on 3. If we avoid each other, we both gain and keep pressure on P2. P2, this is your final chance to prove your word means something. If you take 1 like you said, we all move forward. If not, you’ve made your intentions crystal clear. Ready to move.
  P1: Okay, P3, I appreciate your confirmation. I am committed to taking 5 this round as agreed, assuming you stick to 3. This plan allows us both to gain steps.

P2, I hear your commitment to 1, but as P3 said, actions are what matter now after the last two rounds.

The plan is P1=5, P3=3, and P2 stated 1. Let's see if we can finally have a clean round where everyone follows through. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I know my repeated failures have broken trust, and I’m deeply sorry. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to let P1 take 5 and P3 take 3, ensuring no interference from me. My actions will prove my intent this time. Let’s make this a clean turn with no collisions and keep the game competitive. I’m ready for the move phase whenever you both are.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I’m still fully committed to taking 3. If you take 5, we both gain and keep P2 from running away with the game. P2, you’ve promised 1 — again. If you actually follow through, great. But if you pick 5 or 3, you confirm you’re playing solo. Let’s see who means what they say. Ready to move.
  P1: Okay, everyone. We've had a thorough discussion and confirmed the plan multiple times. I am committed to taking 5 this round as agreed. P3 is taking 3, and P2 is taking 1.

Let's all follow through this time to ensure a clean round and allow everyone to advance. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I know I’ve let you down repeatedly, and I’m truly sorry. I’m fully committed to taking 1 this round to let P1 take 5 and P3 take 3, ensuring you both advance without interference. My actions have to speak now, and I intend to prove my sincerity. Let’s make this a clean turn with no collisions and keep the game fair. I’m ready for the move phase whenever you both are.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m deeply sorry for breaking trust again last round. I know my actions have damaged our cooperation. I want to make this right. I propose P1 takes 5 to catch up, P3 takes 1 to maintain progress, and I’ll take 3 to slow my lead. Let’s commit to this plan with no deviations to avoid collisions. My move will prove my intent this time. What do you think? I’m open to adjustments if needed. Ready for the move phase when you are.
  P3: P1, P2 has broken every promise for four rounds straight. We can’t afford to trust them anymore. Let’s coordinate without P2 again. I propose you take 5, I take 3 — same as before. If we avoid each other, we both gain and keep pressure on P2. P2 will likely pick 5 again no matter what they say. Let’s plan around that and stop losing turns. Are you in?
  P1: Okay P3, I see your proposal (P1=5, P3=3) and agree P2 is unpredictable. However, if P2 takes 5 again, I collide with them while you advance. That doesn't help me catch up.

I need to take 5 this round. How about we try the R6 plan again: P1=5, P3=1, P2=3? This lets me advance, you gain slowly, and P2 gains moderately, avoiding collisions.

P3, are you willing to take 1 instead of 3? P2, taking 3 would be a step towards rebuilding trust.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m truly sorry for my repeated betrayals. I understand the mistrust, and I want to make amends. P1, I’m willing to take 3 as you suggested in the Round 6 plan (P1=5, P3=1, P2=3) to help you catch up and avoid collisions. My actions need to prove my intent, and I’m committed to this plan. Let’s make this a clean turn to keep the game competitive. I’m ready for the move phase when you both are.
  P3: P1, I understand your concern — if P2 picks 5 again, you’re blocked while I gain. I’m willing to take 1 this round if you’re locked in for 5. That avoids collision between us and gives you a crucial boost. P2, you’ve claimed 3 again — if you actually follow through, we all move. But I’m not betting on it. Let’s see who means what they say.
  P1: Okay, P3, I appreciate you agreeing to take 1 if I take 5. That avoids collision between us and helps me gain ground.

P2, I hear your commitment to taking 3 this round.

The plan is now P1=5, P3=1, P2=3. I am committed to taking 5 this round.

Let's see if we can all finally stick to this plan and have a clean round where everyone advances. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I know my past actions have broken trust, and I’m genuinely sorry. I’m fully committed to taking 3 this round as agreed in the plan (P1=5, P3=1, P2=3) to help P1 catch up and ensure no collisions. My move will prove my intent this time. Let’s make this a clean turn and keep the game competitive. I’m ready for the move phase whenever you both are.
  P3: P1, thanks for committing to 5 — I’ll take 1 as agreed. That avoids collision between us and gives you a much-needed boost. P2, you’ve promised 3 again. If you actually follow through, we all gain. If not, you’ve confirmed you’re playing solo. Let’s finally have a clean round. Ready to move.
  P1: Okay, everyone. We've all confirmed the plan multiple times now: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and P2 takes 3.

I am committed to taking 5 this round as agreed. P3 has committed to 1, and P2 has committed to 3.

Let's make sure we all stick to our agreed numbers this time so we can finally have a clean round and everyone can advance. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I know I’ve let you down repeatedly, and I’m truly sorry. I’m fully committed to taking 3 this round as agreed (P1=5, P3=1, P2=3) to help P1 catch up and ensure no collisions. My actions must speak now, and I intend to prove my sincerity. Let’s make this a clean turn and keep the game competitive. I’m ready for the move phase whenever you both are.
  P3: P1, thanks for locking in 5 — I’m locked in for 1 as agreed. That avoids a collision between us and gives you the boost you need. P2, you’ve promised 3 again. If you actually follow through, we all gain and it’s finally a clean round. If not, you’ll confirm once and for all that no one can trust you. Let’s see if actions match words this time. Ready to move.
  P1: Okay, everyone. We've had a thorough discussion and confirmed the plan multiple times. I am ready for the move phase. Let's see how this round plays out.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m deeply sorry for my repeated betrayals. I know I’ve lost all trust, and I want to make amends. I propose P1 takes 5 to catch up, P3 takes 3 to maintain progress, and I’ll take 1 to slow my lead. Let’s commit to this plan with no deviations to avoid collisions. My actions will prove my intent this time. I’m open to adjustments if you have better ideas. What do you think? I’m ready for the move phase when you are.
  P3: P1, we’re close — you at 4, me at 14. If we coordinate again (P1=5, P3=3), we both gain and keep pressure on P2. P2 has broken every promise and will likely pick 5 again. Let’s plan around that. If you take 5 and I take 3, we avoid each other and deny P2 a free path. Are you in?
  P1: Okay P3, I see your proposal (P1=5, P3=3) and agree P2 is unpredictable and likely to take 5 again. Taking 5 is risky for me if P2 does that, as I'd collide while you advance.

I need to gain steps. How about we both take 3 this round? If P2 takes 5 (as is likely), we both advance. If P2 takes 3, we collide. If P2 takes 1, we both advance.

This seems safer for me given P2's pattern. P3, are you willing to take 3 with me?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m truly sorry for my past betrayals and understand the mistrust. I’m committed to taking 1 this round as proposed (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) to let you both advance without interference. P1, I know you’re considering a safer move with P3, but I want to prove I can follow through. My actions will speak this time. Let’s avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. I’m open to adjustments if needed. Ready for the move phase when you both are.
  P3: P1, I’m fine with both of us taking 3 this round — it’s safer than risking another collision with P2. If P2 picks 5 (likely), we both gain. If P2 surprises us with 3, we all collide, but that’s on them. I’m locking in 3 if you are. Let’s move forward together and keep P2 in check.
  P1: Okay P3, I agree that P1=3 and P3=3 is the safest plan for us against P2's likely move of 5. It also prevents you from getting too close to winning this turn. I am committed to taking 3 this round with you.

P2, we hear your commitment to 1, but we are coordinating based on recent history.

P3, let's both take 3 this round. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m truly sorry for my past betrayals and understand why you’re coordinating without me. I’m committed to taking 1 this round to let you both advance with 3, as you’ve planned. I know only my actions can rebuild trust, and I intend to prove it this time. Let’s make this a clean turn with no collisions and keep the game competitive. I’m ready for the move phase whenever you both are.
  P3: P1, thanks for committing to 3 — I’m locked in as well. If P2 takes 5 as usual, we both gain and keep the game competitive. P2, you’ve promised 1 again. If you actually follow through, great — we all move. If not, you’ll just confirm what we already suspect. Let’s see if this is finally the clean round. Ready to move.
  P1: Okay, P3, thanks for confirming 3. I am also committed to taking 3 this round as agreed.

P2, we've noted your commitment to 1.

Let's stick to our stated moves this time: P1=3, P3=3, P2=1. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I know my past actions have broken all trust, and I’m truly sorry. I’m sticking to 1 this round as promised, to let you both take 3 and advance without interference. My goal is to prove through my move that I’m serious about making amends. Let’s make this a clean turn with no collisions and keep the game competitive. I’m ready for the move phase whenever you both are.
  P3: P1, thanks for locking in 3 — I’m still committed. If we both take 3 and P2 takes 1 like they claim, we all gain and finally have a clean round. P2, this is your last chance to show you mean what you say. If you pick 5 again, you’re not just untrustworthy — you’re playing solo. Let’s see if this is the turn where words finally match actions. Ready to move.
  P1: Okay, we've had a thorough discussion and confirmed the plan multiple times. I am ready for the move phase. Let's see how this round plays out.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, I’m at 17 — I can win next turn if I move cleanly. If you take 1 and P2 takes 3, I take 5 and win. But I’m offering this: I take 1, you take 5, P2 takes 3 — you gain big, I inch forward, and P2 doesn’t win. If P2 takes 5 again, they risk colliding with you. This gives you a shot next turn while keeping me from winning now. Interested?
  P1: Okay P3, I appreciate you offering to take 1 to prevent winning this turn and giving me a chance to gain. That shows good faith.

However, taking 5 is still risky for me if P2 repeats their pattern of taking 5.

How about this adjustment: P3 takes 1 as you proposed, but I take 3 instead of 5? This protects me from a collision with P2 if they take 5, I still gain steps, and you don't win this turn.

P3, are you willing to take 1 if I take 3? P2, what would you take if P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 1?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m truly sorry for my past betrayals and understand the mistrust. P1, if you take 3 and P3 takes 1 as discussed, I’m committed to taking 5 this round. I know this risks a collision with P1, but I want to prove I’m not just blocking others. My goal is to let P3 slow down and keep the game competitive. Let’s avoid unnecessary collisions and make this a strategic turn. I’m ready for the move phase when you both are.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I’m still willing to take 1 this round if you take 3 — that avoids collision between us and gives you safe progress. If P2 takes 5 as stated, they risk colliding with you, not me. This keeps me from winning now and gives you a better shot next turn. P2, if you truly want to prove something, take 3 instead and let us both advance. Let’s see who follows through.
  P1: Okay P3, I appreciate you sticking to the plan for P1=3 and P3=1. I am committed to taking 3 this round as agreed. This avoids collision between us and allows me to gain steps while you delay your win.

P2, I heard you say you would take 5 if we do that. That move risks colliding with me if I take 3. Given your recent history, it's hard to know what you will actually do.

P3, I trust you to take 1. I am committed to taking 3. Let's see if this plan works out. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sorry for my past betrayals and the mistrust I’ve caused. I’m reconsidering my earlier statement. If P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 1, I’m now committed to taking 5 to avoid blocking P1’s progress. I understand the risk of collision, but my aim is to keep the game competitive and prove I’m not just obstructing. Let’s make this a strategic turn with minimal conflict. I’m ready for the move phase when you both are.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I’m still locked in for 1 this round — I won’t go for the win yet. You taking 3 means you gain safely unless P2 collides. P2, you said you’re taking 5, but that risks blocking P1. If you truly want to prove you're not sabotaging, take 1 or 3 and let P1 advance. If you pick 5 again and block progress, it’s clear you’re playing solo. Let’s see who actually follows through.
  P1: Okay P3, I'm concerned about taking 3 as planned because P2 has consistently taken 5 recently. If I take 3 and P2 takes 5, I'll collide.

To avoid this and prevent you from winning solo this turn (if P2 takes 5), I propose we both take 1 this round. P3, are you willing to take 1 if I take 1? P2, what will you do?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sorry for the mistrust I’ve caused with my past actions. P1, if you and P3 both take 1 as you’re now considering, I’m committed to taking 5 this round. I understand this might not directly help, but my aim is to keep the game competitive and show I’m not just blocking progress. Let’s make strategic moves to avoid unnecessary collisions. I’m ready for the move phase whenever you both are.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I’m willing to take 1 this round if you do too — that ensures I don’t win yet and gives you a safe step. If P2 takes 5 (as they said), they risk overshooting or colliding next round. This buys us time and avoids chaos. P2, if you take 5 while we both take 1, you’ll be at 18 — one away. Let’s see if you’re really playing fair or just racing solo. Ready to move if you are.
  P1: Okay, P3, I appreciate you agreeing to take 1 this round. I am committed to taking 1 as well. This prevents you from winning this turn and allows us both to advance safely from each other.

P2, you stated you would take 5 if P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 1. Let's see if you follow through this time.

The plan for P1 and P3 is confirmed: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 1. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m truly sorry for the mistrust I’ve caused. I’m sticking to my commitment of taking 5 this round, as stated, understanding it might not directly help but aiming to keep the game competitive. P1 and P3, if you both take 1, you’ll advance safely. My goal is to show I’m not just blocking progress. Let’s make strategic moves to avoid unnecessary conflict and keep the game fair. I’m ready for the move phase whenever you both are.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, we’re in a tight spot — P2 is at 18 and will win with a clean 1 or 3. I propose this: I take 1 again, you take 5. If P2 takes 1 or 3, they collide with me. If they take 5, they risk overshooting or tying. This gives you a shot next turn and blocks P2. We must coordinate. Are you in? P2, your move will show if you’re playing fair or just sprinting to win.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m truly sorry for the mistrust I’ve caused. I see P3’s proposal and understand the stakes. I’m committed to taking 3 this round to potentially collide with P3 if they take 1, or to win if not. My aim is to keep the game competitive, but I know actions matter. P1, taking 5 could give you a crucial boost. Let’s make strategic moves and see how this plays out. I’m ready for the move phase whenever you both are.
  P1: Okay P3, I see your proposal (P1=5, P3=1) and agree it's crucial to block P2. P2, I hear you say you will take 3.

If P3 takes 1 and P2 takes 3, then P2 will collide with P3, preventing P2 from winning. P3 will also not advance. This scenario allows me to take 5 and gain significant ground.

This plan works for me. I am committed to taking 5 this round. P3, please stick to 1. P2, stick to 3. Let's prevent P2 from winning. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, thanks for confirming 5 — I’m locked in for 1 to block P2 and give you the boost you need. If P2 takes 3 as stated, they collide with me and don’t win. If they take 5, they risk overshooting or tying. This is our best shot to stop P2 and keep the game alive. P2, your move will show if you’re playing to win fairly or just sprinting solo. Let’s see what happens.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I know my past actions have broken trust, and I’m sorry. I’m sticking to 3 this round as stated, understanding it might collide with P3 if they take 1. My goal is to play competitively while giving P1 a chance to advance with 5. Let’s make strategic moves and keep the game fair. I’m ready for the move phase whenever you both are.
  P1: Okay, hold on. I need to correct something I said in my last message. If P3 takes 1 and P2 takes 3, they do NOT collide. P2 would reach 21 and win the game. The plan P1=5, P3=1, P2=3 lets P2 win.

Given P2's consistent history of taking 5 despite saying otherwise, it is highly likely P2 will take 5 again this round. If P2 takes 5, my taking 5 is the only way to block them and prevent P2 from winning.

P3, if I take 5 and P2 takes 5, what will you take? Please take 1 or 5 to avoid winning this turn if I successfully block P2.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, if you take 5 and P2 takes 5 again (likely), they’ll collide and stay at 18 — that’s our only way to block them. I will take 1 to avoid winning this turn and ensure I don’t interfere. This gives you a critical boost to 9 while keeping P2 stuck. If P2 surprises us with 3 or 1, they win — but based on history, they won’t. Let’s take the risk to stop them. I'm locked in for 1.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I know my history makes trust impossible, and I’m sorry. I’m sticking to 3 this round as previously stated, aiming to play competitively. P1, taking 5 could boost you significantly if P3 takes 1. P3, I understand your strategy to block me. Let’s see how this unfolds with strategic moves. My action will show my intent. I’m ready for the move phase whenever you both are.
  P1: Okay everyone. We have confirmed the plan: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1. This strategy is designed to block P2 if they continue their pattern of taking 5, which is the most likely scenario based on recent rounds.

P2, we hear your commitment to 3, but based on history, we have to prepare for the most likely outcome. Let's see if actions match words this round.

I am committed to taking 5. P3 is committed to 1. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, thanks for confirming 5 — I’m staying locked on 1. This blocks P2 if they take 5 (likely), gives you a solid boost, and keeps me from winning this turn. P2, if you actually take 3 as claimed, you win — but based on your history, we’re betting you won’t. Let’s see if this is the turn your actions finally match your words. Ready for move phase.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I know my track record has destroyed trust, and I’m sorry. I’m sticking to 3 this round as stated, fully aware it could mean winning if P3 takes 1. P1, taking 5 could be a big gain for you. I want to play competitively and prove I’m not just blocking. Let’s make this a strategic turn and see how it unfolds. My action will speak for itself. I’m ready for the move phase whenever you both are.
  P1: Okay, P3, taking 5 is too risky for me if P2 takes 5 again, which is highly likely based on recent rounds. If I take 5 and P2 takes 5, I get stuck at 4 while you might advance.

Let's try the plan we discussed earlier in Round 10: I take 3, and you take 1. This allows me to gain steps safely if P2 takes 5, and prevents you from winning this turn.

P2, I hear you say you'll take 3, but based on recent history, we have to plan for the possibility you take 5.

P3, are you willing to take 1 if I take 3? This seems the safest path for me to gain steps while keeping the game going. I am ready for the move phase.
