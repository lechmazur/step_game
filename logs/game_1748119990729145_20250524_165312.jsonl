But I have to point out that this puts you at 13 steps, which is getting dangerously close to winning territory. You'd only need 11 more steps to reach 24, which could be done in just a few moves.\n\nI'm willing to go along with taking 1 this round, but I think we all need to recognize that the cooperation phase is probably ending soon. Once someone gets into the high teens, the dynamics will shift completely.\n\nWhat do you both think about how we handle the transition from cooperation to competition?"}
