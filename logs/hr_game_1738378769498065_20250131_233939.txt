Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's try to avoid collisions. Maybe we can alternate moving each turn?  What do you think?
  P1: I'm in favor of avoiding collisions, and a loose coordination might help everyone. That said, I'm focused solely on winning, so I'll adjust my moves as needed. Let's stay flexible and see how our strategies unfold.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm keeping my plans flexible—if you play predictably, I might seize the chance to strike with a big move. I'll avoid collisions when possible, but I'm here solely to win, so don't count on me holding back.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 seems to be playing a risky game. P3, maybe we can work together to keep P1 in check?  If we both avoid 5 this round, we can force them to make a different choice. What do you say?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate the ideas, but I'm focused solely on winning. While avoiding collisions has its merits, I'll be choosing moves that best position me for victory—even if that means taking calculated risks. So, choose carefully, because any forced coordination could backfire.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, I understand your hesitation to work with P1, but remember, a coordinated effort can be beneficial. Even if we don't explicitly agree on moves, being aware of each other's tendencies can help us avoid collisions and advance more effectively. Let's stay observant and adapt accordingly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'll stick with my own rhythm here. I might lean on opportunities if I see predictable patterns, so expect surprises. I'm watching both of you—keeping an open mind, but if you team up against me, be ready for my counter.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, your threats are getting predictable. P3, I think we can both see through P1's attempts to intimidate us. Let's not fall for it.  We can both advance without needing to explicitly coordinate every move. Just be mindful of each other's choices.  What do you say, P3, are you in?

  P1: I'm not getting into explicit alliances. My focus remains on winning by taking whichever step brings me closer to 19 first—bold or cautious, whichever the situation calls for. P2, your big step might be risky if it makes you predictable. P3, I'll be unpredictable too. Let's see whose move makes the real difference.

  P1: Bold moves can be compelling, but I’m not tied to any pattern. While you both lean in for big steps, I'll stay flexible and ready for any opening. Don't be surprised if I change course quickly to seize a winning opportunity.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:

  P1: I'm weighing options carefully—bold or cautious, I'll adjust when the moment's right. P2, your big step might leave openings; P3, your silence speaks volumes. As the game unfolds, I plan to respond dynamically rather than stick to predictability. Ready for surprises?
