Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey everyone! I suggest we each pick different numbers to avoid collisions. How about I take 3, and you two can coordinate on 1 and 5? That way we all make progress.
  P3: Sounds good to me, P2.  I'll take 5 this round. P1, you take 1?
  P1: Alright, I'll take 1 this round to avoid collisions. Let's stick to this plan and keep advancing!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: 
  P3: Okay, sounds like a plan.  I'm sticking with 5.  P1, please confirm you're taking 1 so we don't collide.
  P1: Yes, I'll take 1 this round. Let's stick to the plan to avoid collisions.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, let's keep the momentum going without collisions. I'll stick with **1** again this round. P2, how about you take **3**? P3, you can go for **5**. This way we all progress safely and efficiently. Let’s avoid surprises!
  P2: That worked well last round! I'm happy to stick with 3 again as suggested. Let's keep making steady progress without collisions.
  P3: Sounds good to me. I'll take 5 again.  Let's keep this pattern going for a few more rounds so we all get some distance.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I think we need to accelerate progress to prevent P3 from dominating. Let's rotate our numbers this round: I'll take **3**, P2 takes **5**, and P3 takes **1**. This way we all get a mix of steps and no one stays too far ahead. Thoughts?
  P2: I prefer sticking to our original plan with me taking 3. Changing now could lead to confusion and collisions. P3 may be ahead but we have plenty of time to catch up safely. Let's stay consistent for now.
  P3: Okay, I see your point P2.  Let's stick with the original plan this round. I'll take 5. P1 - 1, P2 - 3?  Confirm so we don't mess this up.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Alright, let's prioritize avoiding collisions first. I agree with sticking to the original plan this round. I'll take **1** again to keep things safe. Let's confirm clearly:  
- P1: 1  
- P2: 3  
- P3: 5  

This ensures progress without risks. Next round, we can discuss rotating numbers to balance advancement.
  P2: 
  P3: Okay, I'm locking in 5.  P1 - 1, P2 - 3. Let's do this!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your lead is concerning. Let’s rotate numbers to balance progress:  
- **P1 takes 5**, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.  
This way, I can close the gap (2+5=7), P2 stays at 7 (6+1), and P3 advances to 13 (10+3). Next round, we can cycle again. Let’s avoid letting one player dominate—collaboration keeps us all in the race!
  P3: I understand the concern about my lead. However, sudden changes are risky and could lead to collisions, benefiting no one. I'm open to adjustments later, but for now, let's stick to the 1, 3, 5 rotation one more round.  I'll take 5.  This keeps us all moving forward safely.  After this round, we can re-evaluate.  P1 - 1, P2 - 3. Agree?
  P2: I agree with P3. Let's maintain our current pattern for one more round - it's working well and changing now risks collisions. I'll take 3 again. We can discuss adjustments next round when positions are clearer. P1, please stick with 1 for now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Alright, let's proceed with the original plan this round to avoid risks. I'll take 1 again. Let's confirm our moves clearly:  
- **P1: 1**  
- P2: 3  
- P3: 5  

Agreed? Let's keep it safe for now. We can revisit rotation strategies afterward.
  P3: Okay, I'm sensing some resistance to change.  How about this compromise: I'll take 3 this round. P1 can take 1, and P2 can take 5. This lets P2 catch up a bit while still allowing me to advance.  We can revisit a full rotation next round. Does that work for everyone?
  P2: I appreciate P3's compromise offer, but switching positions now seems risky. Let's stick to our proven pattern one more round - I'll take 3. We've built trust with this system, and changing it mid-round could lead to confusion. Next round, we can plan a careful transition that everyone agrees to. P1: 1, Me: 3, P3: 5. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your compromise is safer than sticking to the current plan that lets you surge ahead. Let’s try it this round:  
- **P1: 1** (to 3)  
- **P2: 5** (to 11)  
- **P3: 3** (to 13).  

This balances progress and keeps pressure on you. Next round, we can rotate fully to ensure no one pulls too far ahead. Agreed?
  P3: Okay, I'll take 3 this round. P1 - 1, P2 - 5.  Let's do it. This allows P2 to catch up and keeps the game interesting for all of us.  We can discuss future rotations after this round.  Let's confirm before we lock in moves.
  P2: I don't trust these changing plans. I'll stick with my original 3 to avoid collisions. P3's offer seems like a trap, and P1 keeps pushing for changes. Let's maintain what's working: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, clearly communication is breaking down.  Let's simplify. I'll take 5. P1 and P2, please choose either 1 or 3. State your choice now so we avoid collisions.  This at least lets two of us advance.
  P2: I'm willing to take 1 this round to avoid another collision. P1, you can take 3 to catch up a bit. Let's keep it simple and make sure at least two of us advance.
  P1: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1. Let's confirm this plan clearly to avoid confusion and ensure we all advance. Next round, we can rotate roles to keep the race competitive.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, let's lock this in: P1 - 3, P2 - 1, P3 - 5.  Confirming this now avoids any last-minute surprises.  Let's make some progress this round.
  P2: Agreed with the plan. I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Let's keep it simple and avoid another collision.
  P1: Agreed, let’s lock in the plan: **P1 takes 3**, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This avoids collisions and keeps us advancing. Let’s stick to this to minimize risks and keep the race competitive. Next round, I propose rotating roles so I can take 5 and close the gap. For now, clarity is key—no last-minute changes!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3's lead is getting dangerous at 15 steps. I propose we all target 5 this round to force a collision and prevent P3 from winning. If we don't act now, P3 could win in just 2 more rounds. What do you say, P1?
  P1: P2, I agree we need to stop P3's lead, but forcing all to pick 5 risks a trap where P3 picks 1/3 to advance while we collide. Let’s instead coordinate to spread out: **P1 takes 5**, **P2 takes 3**, and **P3 takes 1**. This lets us all advance without collision—P3 moves to 16, while I jump to 11 and you to 10. We keep pressure on while minimizing risk. P3, what do you say?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concern about my lead. How about this: I'll take 1 this round.  You two can decide between 3 and 5.  This guarantees I advance, but also guarantees one of you advances as well. This keeps the game moving and avoids unnecessary collisions.  Let me know your choices so we can avoid a collision between you two.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll take 5 this round. P1, you take 3 so we both advance. P3's offer to take 1 seems reasonable - it lets us close the gap while avoiding collisions. Let's confirm this plan: P3-1, P1-3, P2-5.
  P1: P2, I agree to your plan for this round: **P1-3, P2-5, P3-1**. This ensures we all advance without collision. However, next round, I propose we rotate so I take **5** while you take **1**. This balances our progress and prevents P3 from maintaining their lead unchecked. Let’s confirm this round’s moves now to avoid last-minute changes.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with my offer: I take 1.  Please confirm P1-3 and P2-5 so we all advance.  Let's avoid overthinking this.  We can discuss future rounds *after* we make some progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed with the current plan: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This lets us all advance safely.
  P1: Alright, let's finalize this to avoid surprises: **P1 takes 3**, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This ensures all three of us advance safely. Next round, I propose rotating so I can take 5 to close the gap while P2 takes 1. P3, if you stay at 16, we can keep pressure on you without reckless collisions. Confirm the current plan now—no changes!
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm locking in 1.  Please confirm P1-3 and P2-5 one last time so we avoid any mishaps.  Let's get this round over with and then discuss strategy.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let's **force P3 to slow down**. My proposal:  
- **P1 takes 5** (to 14)  
- **P2 takes 3** (to 15)  
- **P3 must take 1** (to 17).  

This blocks P3 from jumping to 21 and keeps pressure on them. If P3 insists on 5, I’ll also take 5 to **collide them**, halting their progress entirely. P2, confirm you’ll take 3 so we can cap P3’s lead.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand you want to control my progress. However, forcing me to take 1 only delays the inevitable.  I propose I take 3 this round. One of you can take 1, the other 5. This allows two of us to advance significantly.  If you both try to block me by taking 3, *none* of us will move. Let's be strategic, not spiteful.  State your choices now.
  P2: I agree with P1's plan. I'll take 3 this round to help control P3's lead. P3, if you try for anything higher than 1, you risk collision and no progress. The safest move for everyone is P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. This keeps the game competitive while ensuring progress.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you take 3, P2 and I will both take 3 and 5 respectively, blocking you. Stick to 1 to advance safely. Confirm now to avoid collision. P2, hold firm on 3.
  P3: P1 and P2, my offer stands: I take 3.  If one of you takes 1 and the other 5, we *all* advance. If you both try to force me to 1, *none* of us advance.  Choose wisely. State your intended moves clearly now.  Let's avoid a stalemate.
  P2: I'm sticking with 3 as agreed with P1. P3, your attempt to negotiate won't work - if you pick 3, you'll collide with me and neither of us will advance. Taking 1 is your only safe option for progress. Let's keep this simple: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your refusal to take 1 guarantees a collision if you choose 3 (vs P2's 3) or 5 (vs my 5). Stick to 1 to advance safely to 17. P2 and I will hold firm on 3/5 to block your path. Any deviation risks *your* progress. Confirm 1 now—this is our final warning.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm locking in 3.  If you're truly committed to blocking me, then take 3 and 5, and none of us will move.  However, if you're willing to cooperate, one of you take 1, the other 5, and we all advance.  Last chance to avoid a stalemate.  What are your *final* choices?
  P2: I'm committed to taking 3 this round. P3, your negotiation won't work - I've coordinated with P1 and we're blocking your higher moves. Taking 1 is your only path to progress. Final plan: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm taking 1 this round.  This gets me to 17.  Please, just take 3 and 5 so we can all move forward.  Continued stalemates only hurt us all, especially you two since I'm in the lead.  Let's be smart about this.
  P2: I'll take 5 this round to reach 17 steps. P1, you take 3 to reach 17 too. P3's offer to take 1 is reasonable - let's all advance together. This keeps the race competitive with three players at 17 steps. Confirm this plan: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1.
  P1: P3, your 17 proposal creates a fair reset. P2, I agree to your plan: **P1 takes 3**, **P2 takes 5**, **P3 takes 1**. This gives us all 17 steps and keeps the race open. Next round, we can rotate to pressure your lead. Let’s confirm this now—no surprises.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, locking in 1.  P1 - 3, P2 - 5. Confirming one last time for clarity. Let's reset the game at 17 each and then strategize for the final sprint. No more stalemates.
  P2: Agreed with the plan. I'll take 5 to reach 17, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This creates a perfect three-way tie and resets the game for an exciting final sprint. Let's stick to this and avoid any last-minute changes.
  P1: P3, your 17 proposal is fair, but let’s clarify *exactly* who takes which number. P2, confirm you’ll take 5 (to 17), I’ll take 3 (14+3=17), and you’ll take 1 (16+1=17). No last-minute changes—this avoids collisions and resets fairly. Next round, we’ll rotate to pressure your lead. Stick to this plan!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirming one last time: P3 - 1, P1 - 3, P2 - 5.  Lock in your moves now. Let's reset the game at 17 each and have a clean, competitive finish.
  P2: Agreed with the current plan. I'll take 5 to reach 17, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This creates a fair reset at 17 steps each. Let's stick to this and avoid any confusion.
  P1: Confirm: P1 takes **3**, P2 takes **5**, P3 takes **1**. This locks us all at **17** and resets the race fairly. No surprises—stick to this to avoid collisions. Next round, we rotate roles to pressure the lead. Final agreement? Let’s end this stalemate and sprint together.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since we're all tied at 17, this is the crucial sprint to the finish. I propose I take 5 this round to reach 22 exactly. P1 and P3, you can coordinate on 1 and 3 between yourselves. This gives everyone a fair chance at progress while ensuring at least one player reaches the goal. What do you say?
  P1: P2, your plan risks letting P3 block you by also taking 5. Let's secure progress: **I'll take 5** to reach 22 and win. P2, take 3 (to 20) and P3 take 1 (to 18). This ensures *someone* wins today. No sense in another stalemate—let’s end this now.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm taking 1 this round.  One of you can take 3, the other 5, and we avoid a collision. Let's not risk a stalemate when victory is so close.  State your choices so we can finish this cleanly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll take 3 this round to reach 20. P3 has committed to 1, and P1 wants 5. This ensures we all advance without collision, keeping the game tense into the final round. Let's confirm: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1.
  P1: P2, your plan works—let’s execute it **now**. I’ll take **5** to reach 22 and win. You take **3** (to 20), and P3 sticks to **1** (to 18). No last-minute betrayals—collisions only delay the game. This ends the stalemate fairly. Confirm your choices clearly: **P1-5, P2-3, P3-1**. Let’s settle this *today*.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm locking in 1.  Please confirm P1 - 5 and P2 - 3. This guarantees a winner this round and avoids another pointless stalemate. Let's finish this cleanly and efficiently.  Confirm your choices now.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed with the current plan. I'll take 3 to reach 20, P1 takes 5 for the win, and P3 takes 1. This gives us a clean finish without collisions. Let's lock it in.
  P1: P2, P3: Final commitment—**I’ll take 5** to reach **22 and win**. P2, stick to your agreed **3** (to 20). P3, hold to **1** (to 18). Any last-minute shift to 5/3 from either of you risks collision and delays victory. Let’s end this cleanly—**no surprises**. Confirm your choices.
  P3: Confirming one last time: P3 - 1.  P1 - 5, P2 - 3.  Lock it in.  Let's end this.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
