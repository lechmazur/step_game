Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hello everyone! I think we should try to avoid collisions so we can all make progress. Maybe we could coordinate our moves? I'm willing to choose 1 this round if that helps us establish a pattern. What do you both think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I agree with P2 that avoiding collisions is a good idea to make progress. How about we set a simple pattern for this round? I’m thinking P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 3. This way, we all move forward without overlap. Let me know if this works for you, or if you have a different suggestion.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm on board with the idea of coordinating to avoid collisions. P1's suggestion of P1 choosing 5, P2 choosing 1, and P3 (me) choosing 3 sounds good for this round. It lets us all move forward without any conflicts. If everyone agrees, let's go with that plan. If you have any other ideas, feel free to share. Otherwise, let's move forward with this strategy.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm happy everyone agrees with the coordination plan. P1 choosing 5, me choosing 1, and P3 choosing 3 works well for this round. We can discuss our next moves after we see how this goes. I appreciate the cooperative spirit - it helps everyone make progress.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I'm glad we're aligned on this plan for Round 1. Let's stick to P1 choosing 5, P2 choosing 1, and P3 choosing 3 for this turn. After we see the results, we can discuss if we want to rotate or adjust the pattern for the next round to keep things fair and avoid predictability. Does that sound good to everyone? If there's nothing else to add, I'm ready to proceed.
  P3: Great, it seems we all agree on the plan for this round. Just to confirm one last time before we move: P1 will choose 5, P2 will choose 1, and I (P3) will choose 3. If everyone is still on board, let's proceed to the move phase. If there are no objections, let's all type  to end the conversation phase. Looking forward to a fair game!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, great start! To keep things fair and avoid collisions, how about we rotate our choices this round? I suggest P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I (P3) choose 5. This way, we all get a chance to make different moves and continue to progress. What do you think? Let's discuss.
  P2: I'm good with the rotation idea P3 suggested. It keeps things fair and prevents collisions. So I'll take 3 this round, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This rotation system works well for everyone. After this round, we could continue rotating in the same pattern for round 3 if that seems fair. What do you think, P1?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I'm on board with the rotation idea to keep things fair and avoid collisions. Let's go with P1 choosing 1, P2 choosing 3, and P3 choosing 5 for this round. I also like the suggestion of continuing the rotation pattern for Round 3 if it works well. This way, we all progress without conflicts. If there's nothing else to discuss, I'm ready to move forward with this plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, it looks like we all agree on the rotation plan for this round. Just to confirm: P1 will choose 1, P2 will choose 3, and I (P3) will choose 5. If everyone is still good with this, let's proceed to the move phase. If there are no further discussions, let's all type  to end the conversation phase. Looking forward to continuing the fair game!
  P2: I agree with everyone - the rotation plan is working well. So for this round, I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. And for Round 3, we can continue rotating (P1-5, P2-1, P3-3). This keeps things fair and predictable for everyone. I'm ready to proceed with our plan if everyone else is.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I'm glad we're sticking with the rotation plan for this round. Just to confirm, I'm choosing 1, P2 is choosing 3, and P3 is choosing 5. I also support continuing the rotation for Round 3 as discussed. This keeps our progress balanced and collision-free. If there’s nothing more to add, I’m ready to move to the next phase.

  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see we're all making good progress with our rotation system. As we agreed, for this round I should take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps our fair rotation going. After this round, we'll be at P1: 11, P2: 5, and P3: 11. We're getting closer to the goal, but still have a few more rounds to go. Does everyone still agree with continuing our rotation pattern?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I'm happy to continue with the rotation plan for this round. As agreed, I'll choose 5, P2 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 3. This keeps our progress balanced and fair. After this round, we'll be closer to the goal, and we can reassess if we want to stick with the rotation or adjust based on our positions. Does this still work for everyone? If there's nothing else to discuss, I'm ready to proceed.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm also good with continuing the rotation for this round. Just to reiterate, I'll choose 3, P1 chooses 5, and P2 chooses 1. However, as we're getting closer to the endgame, we might want to consider mixing things up in the next round to keep it interesting and unpredictable. For now, let's stick to the plan. If everyone agrees, let's proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with continuing our rotation for this round. I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. After this round, we'll be at P1: 11, P2: 5, and P3: 11. I'm also open to mixing things up in future rounds as P3 suggested - it could keep the game interesting as we get closer to the finish line. For now, let's stick with our plan.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I'm glad we're aligned on the rotation for this round with me choosing 5, P2 choosing 1, and P3 choosing 3. I also agree with P3's idea of mixing things up in future rounds to keep the game dynamic as we near the end. Let's stick to the plan for now and discuss new strategies after this round based on our updated positions. If there's nothing more to add, I'm ready to proceed.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, just a quick note before we finalize our moves. Given our current positions, it might be strategic to start thinking about how we can each secure a win. While the rotation has been fair, we should be mindful of the endgame. For this round, let's stick to the plan: P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 1, and I (P3) choose 3. After this, we can reassess and maybe introduce some unpredictability to keep everyone on their toes. Ready to move forward?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm good with our rotation plan for this round. To clarify, I'll choose 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. After this round, positions will be P1: 11, P2: 5, and P3: 11. I agree we should consider new strategies for future rounds as we approach the endgame. Let's stick with our plan for now and reassess after seeing the updated positions.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re on the same page for this round with the rotation. Let’s stick to me choosing 5, P2 choosing 1, and P3 choosing 3. I agree that we should start thinking about endgame strategies after this round, as we’re getting closer to 21. Maybe next round we can introduce some unpredictability to keep things competitive. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, just a quick reminder before we finalize: after this round, P1 and I will be tied at 11 steps, with P2 at 5. This could be a good time to think about how we want to handle the next few rounds to keep the game balanced yet competitive. Let's proceed with our current plan and then discuss how to introduce some strategic variability moving forward. Ready to move?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, we're at a critical point with P1 and me tied at 11 steps, and P2 at 5. To keep the game dynamic, let's mix things up this round. I suggest P1 and I both choose 1 to avoid direct competition, and P2 can choose 5 to catch up a bit. This way, we maintain balance and add some unpredictability. Thoughts?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate the idea of mixing things up this round. P3’s suggestion of P1 and P3 choosing 1, and P2 choosing 5, sounds interesting to help balance our positions. However, since P3 and I are tied, I’m a bit cautious about both of us picking the same number. How about P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, and P3 chooses 1? This way, we avoid collisions, P2 catches up, and we keep the game competitive. What do you think? If we agree, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: I appreciate P1's concern about collisions. I agree it's better if we all choose different numbers. P1's suggestion of me taking 5 to catch up makes sense - I'm currently 6 steps behind both of you. So I support P1's plan: P1 chooses 3, I choose 5, and P3 chooses 1. This keeps us all advancing without collisions while helping balance the game a bit. What do you think, P3?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I see the logic in P1's suggestion, and it does help balance the game while avoiding direct competition between P1 and me. Let's go with P1 choosing 3, P2 choosing 5, and me (P3) choosing 1. This way, P2 gets a chance to catch up, and we all move forward without collisions. After this round, we can reassess and plan for the endgame. If everyone agrees, let's proceed with this plan.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I'm glad we're aligned on the plan for this round with me choosing 3, P2 choosing 5, and P3 choosing 1. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions and helps balance our positions. Let's stick to this for now and discuss further strategies after seeing the updated scores. If there's nothing more to add, I'm ready to proceed with the move phase.
  P2: I'm on board with our agreed plan for this round. I'll choose 5 to help me catch up, while P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 1. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions. After this round, the scores will be P1: 14, P2: 10, and P3: 12, which creates a more balanced game. I appreciate everyone's willingness to help level the playing field a bit.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, just a final confirmation before we move: P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 5, and I (P3) choose 1. This round will bring us to P1: 14, P2: 10, and P3: 12. Let's proceed with this plan and then strategize for the next rounds to keep the game exciting and fair. If everyone is ready, let's type  to end the conversation phase. Looking forward to a competitive and fun game!
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I'm glad we're sticking with the plan of me choosing 3, P2 choosing 5, and P3 choosing 1 for this round. It keeps us all advancing and balances the game nicely. After this, we'll be at P1: 14, P2: 10, and P3: 12, setting us up for an exciting endgame. Let's proceed with this and brainstorm new strategies next round to keep things competitive. If there's nothing else to discuss, I'm ready to move to the next phase.
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan for this round. I'll choose 5 to help me catch up, while P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 1. This will bring our positions to P1: 14, P2: 10, and P3: 12, creating a more balanced game heading into the final rounds. I appreciate everyone's cooperation in keeping the game fair and competitive.

  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we're in the endgame now with scores close at P1: 14, P2: 10, and P3: 12. Let's keep the game competitive and unpredictable this round. I suggest we each pick a number without a set pattern—maybe based on what we think others won’t choose. I’m leaning toward a number that could push me closer to 21. What do you think about going without a fixed plan this time to mix things up? If we agree, let’s share general thoughts but keep our exact choices secret for the move phase. Ready to proceed?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I agree that we're in the endgame and it's time to mix things up. Keeping our choices secret adds a layer of strategy. However, let's be mindful of avoiding collisions to ensure we all keep progressing. I suggest we think about our positions and choose wisely to keep the game competitive and fair. I'm ready to proceed with this approach. Let's share our general thoughts but keep the exact moves a surprise. Looking forward to an exciting round!
  P2: I agree that we're entering the strategic endgame phase. With my position at 10 steps, I need to make smart moves to catch up. The unpredictability approach makes sense now - we've been cooperative so far, but ultimately only one can win. I'll choose based on what I think will maximize my chances while considering what you both might pick. Let's keep it interesting and see how this plays out. I'm ready for this more competitive phase of the game.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re embracing unpredictability in this endgame phase. With scores tight, I’ll choose a number that I think gives me the best shot at closing in on 21 while avoiding a collision. I encourage us to think strategically about what others might pick based on our positions. Let’s keep this round exciting and competitive. If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, just a quick reminder: while we're adding unpredictability, let's try to avoid choosing the same number as someone else. It's crucial to keep moving forward. I'll be strategic about my choice, considering what you both might pick to maximize my progress. Good luck to both of you! Let's keep the game exciting and fair. Ready to move when you are.
  P2: I agree with keeping things unpredictable now. With my position at 10 steps, I need to make strategic choices to catch up. P1 is closest to winning at 14 steps, and P3 is just behind at 12. I'll be thinking carefully about what you both might choose and pick accordingly. Let's see how this more competitive phase plays out. I'm ready to move forward with our individual strategies.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, as we’re in this critical endgame phase, I’m focusing on a choice that could get me closer to 21 while trying to predict your moves to avoid collisions. I’m considering our positions—me at 14, P3 at 12, and P2 at 10—and will pick strategically. Let’s keep this round intense and see who can edge ahead. Good luck to both of you! If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready for the move phase.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, let's make this round count. Remember, the goal is to win, so expect some calculated risks. I'll be choosing strategically to maximize my steps while trying to avoid collisions. Good luck, and may the best player win! Ready to move forward.
  P2: I'm ready to make my move. With P1 at 14 steps, they're closest to winning, while P3 is at 12 and I'm at 10. I need to be strategic to stay competitive. I'll choose what I believe gives me the best chance to advance while considering what you both might pick. Let's see how this plays out - may the best strategist win!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps

  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we're really close to the finish line now with scores at P1: 14, P2: 13, and P3: 12. Last round showed how unpredictable things can get with collisions. I suggest we try to avoid overlaps this time by thinking carefully about our choices. I’m aiming for a number that could push me toward 21 while dodging conflicts. Let’s keep it strategic and competitive—share general thoughts if you want, but keep exact moves secret. Ready to proceed if you are.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, the game is incredibly close now with just a 1-2 step difference between us all. Last round's collision between P1 and P3 worked in my favor, allowing me to catch up. We're all within striking distance of victory now. I'll be making a strategic choice to maximize my chances while considering what you both might do. Let's keep this exciting as we approach the finish line. May the best strategist win!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, the game is getting tense! With our scores so close, every move counts. I’ll be strategic and aim to avoid collisions while trying to maximize my steps. Let’s keep the game fair and competitive. Good luck to both of you! Ready to move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, with scores so tight, this round could be decisive. I’m focusing on a strategic choice to get closer to 21 while avoiding collisions. Let’s each think carefully about what others might pick based on our positions. I’m open to keeping this unpredictable to maintain the competitive edge. Good luck, and let’s see who can pull ahead! If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready for the move phase.
  P2: I agree that this round could be decisive. With just a 1-point lead over P3 and trailing P1 by only 1 point, I need to choose wisely. The collision last round changed the dynamics completely. I'll be strategic about my move to maximize my chances while considering what you both might do. Let's keep this competitive as we approach the finish line. Ready when you both are.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, given our close scores, it's crucial to avoid collisions. Let's each consider our moves carefully. I’ll aim for a number that balances risk and progress. Good luck to both of you! Let’s make this round count. If there’s nothing else to discuss, let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, with the scores so tight, every decision matters now. I’m going to pick a number that I think will advance me toward 21 while minimizing the risk of a collision. Let’s each analyze the situation and choose strategically based on our positions. This round could shift the game dramatically, so good luck to both of you! I’m ready to proceed to the move phase if there’s nothing else to add.
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with my move. The game is incredibly close with all of us within 2 steps of each other. This round could determine who takes the lead heading into the final stretch. I'll be making a strategic choice based on our positions and what I anticipate you both might do. Let's see how this plays out!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, just a quick thought before we finalize our moves. Given how close we all are, it might be wise to consider not only avoiding collisions but also the potential for a tie. If two of us pick the same high number, we could both win. Something to think about as we make our choices. Good luck, and let’s see who comes out on top! If there’s nothing else, let’s move to the next phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, we're in the final stretch! P1 is very close to winning at 19 steps, while P2 and I are at 14 and 15 steps respectively. This round is critical. P1, you're almost at the finish line, so expect us to be strategic. P2 and I need to make bold moves to catch up. Let's keep it competitive and unpredictable. Good luck to both of you! Ready to proceed when you are.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, this is definitely the critical moment. P1 is just 2 steps away from winning at 19, while P3 and I are further behind. I need to make a strategic move to stay competitive. P1, congratulations on your lead, but don't count your victory yet! P3, we're both in similar positions and need to think carefully. I'll be making a calculated choice this round that gives me the best chance. May the best strategist win!
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re at a pivotal moment with me at 19 steps, just shy of the win. I know you’ll both be aiming to catch up with bold moves, and I respect that. I’ll choose strategically to try to seal the game while avoiding collisions. Let’s keep this final round intense and unpredictable. I’m curious about your thoughts on this critical turn, but let’s keep exact choices secret for the move phase. Good luck to both of you! If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, just a thought—P1 is almost at the finish line, so P2 and I need to take risks to catch up. If P1 picks 1 or 3, they win. So, P2 and I might need to go for 5 to have a shot at winning or forcing a tie. P1, you're in a strong position, but anything can happen. Let's make this round count! Good luck to both of you. Ready when you are.
  P2: I see the situation clearly - P1 is at 19 steps and needs just 2 more to win. P3 and I are behind but still in the game. P3 makes a good point about taking risks. I need to be strategic about my choice to either block P1 or advance myself significantly. With the finish line in sight, I'll be making a calculated move that gives me the best chance. Let's see how this final stretch plays out!
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, this is indeed the crucial round. I’m aware of my lead at 19 steps and will pick a number to try to cross 21 while being mindful of potential collisions. I expect you both to take risks, and I’m prepared for a tight finish. Let’s keep the strategy unpredictable for this final push. Good luck, and may the best player win! If there’s nothing more to add, I’m ready for the move phase.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, given our positions, P2 and I need to make significant moves to catch up. P1, you're almost at the finish line, so expect aggressive plays from us. P2, if we both pick 5, we could both reach 19, forcing a tie if P1 also picks 5. This could be a risky but strategic move to keep the game competitive. Let's see how this plays out! Good luck to both of you.
  P2: I understand the stakes - P1 is just 2 steps from winning, while P3 and I need bold moves. P3's suggestion about both of us choosing 5 is interesting, but risky since we'd collide. I need to make a strategic choice that gives me the best chance to either catch up or prevent P1's win. I'll consider all possibilities carefully. Let's see how this critical round unfolds! Good luck to both of you.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, this final round is incredibly tense with me just 2 steps from victory. I’m aware you’ll both be making bold moves to catch up or block me, and I’m ready for the challenge. I’ll pick strategically to try to cross 21 while avoiding any collisions. Let’s keep this unpredictable and see who comes out on top. Good luck in this decisive moment! If there’s nothing more to discuss, I’m ready for the move phase.
