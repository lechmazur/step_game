Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. How about P1 and P2 choose <move>1</move>, and I'll choose <move>3</move> this round? This way, we all make progress. What do you think?
  P2: Sounds good to me P3.  P1, do you agree with this plan?
  P1: I agree. P2 and I will choose <move>1</move> as planned. Let's stick to P3's strategy to avoid collisions. No deviations.

  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you deviated from the plan last round, which caused a collision with P2. Let's try to coordinate again. How about this time, P1 chooses <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and I'll choose <move>5</move>? This way, we can all move forward without collisions. Let me know your thoughts.
  P2: Okay, P3, I'll choose 3. P1, please stick to the plan this time and choose 1 so we can all advance.  Let's avoid any more unnecessary collisions.
  P1: Apologies for the confusion last round. I'll stick to the plan: <move>1</move> this time. P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Let's avoid collisions and all advance. Trust is key here.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Alright, let's confirm our plan for this round. P1 will choose <move>1</move>, P2 will choose <move>3</move>, and I will choose <move>5</move>. This ensures no collisions and we all make progress. Let's stick to this and move forward. Trust and coordination will help us all advance efficiently. Any final thoughts before we proceed?

  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **Proposed Move Rotation to Balance Progress:**  
P3, your lead puts you in a strong position, but continued 5s will end the game quickly. To ensure fair play, let's rotate high moves: I'll take <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This allows everyone to advance without collisions. If you insist on 5, I’ll have to match it, causing mutual stagnation. Cooperation benefits all—let’s avoid unnecessary conflict. P2, support this to keep the game competitive.
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about balancing progress. However, I'm currently in the lead, and choosing <move>3</move> would slow my momentum. How about a compromise? I'll choose <move>3</move> this round, but let's agree that in the next round, I get to choose <move>5</move> again. P2, you can choose <move>1</move> this round as P1 suggested. Let's maintain coordination and avoid collisions. P1, if you agree, you can choose <move>5</move> this round. Thoughts?
  P2: P3 and P1, I'm okay with taking 1 this round.  However, I agree with P1 that we need a fair rotation for the larger moves to keep the game interesting.  How about we agree to rotate 5, 3, 1 in that order for the next few rounds? P1 goes 5 this round, P3 goes 3, then I go 1. Next round, I go 5, P1 goes 3, P3 goes 1.  And so on. Does that sound fair?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **Proposed Rotation Agreement:**  
P2's plan balances progress. Let's lock in rotating 5/3/1 each round:  
- **This round:** P1-5, P3-3, P2-1  
- **Next round:** P2-5, P1-3, P3-1  
- **Following:** P3-5, P2-3, P1-1  
This ensures fair advancement and prevents runaway leads. P3, delaying your 5 by two rounds keeps the game competitive. Agreed?
  P3: P3: Alright, I agree with the rotation plan proposed by P2 and supported by P1. It ensures fairness and keeps the game competitive. To confirm for this round: I'll choose <move>3</move>, P1 will choose <move>5</move>, and P2 will choose <move>1</move>. Next round, we'll rotate as agreed. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions and maintain a balanced game. Any final confirmations before we proceed?
  P2: Sounds good P3. I'll take 1 this round as agreed.  Let's stick to this rotation.  Confirming my move will be <move>1</move>.  P1 and P3, please confirm <move>5</move> and <move>3</move> respectively so we're all on the same page.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **Final Confirmation:**  
Agreed. Locked in: P1-5, P3-3, P2-1. Sticking to this rotation ensures balanced progress. Let's all confirm to avoid collisions. P3, your 3 this round maintains fairness. P2, your 1 keeps the rotation intact. No deviations—trust is crucial.
  P3: P3: Before we finalize, let's quickly reaffirm our commitment to the rotation plan. It's crucial we all stick to our agreed moves to prevent any accidental collisions. P1, you're going for <move>5</move>, P2, you're on <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. Next round, we rotate as planned. Let's keep the game fair and engaging. Any last thoughts or confirmations?
  P2: Confirming one last time: I'm going with <move>1</move> this round.  P1 - <move>5</move>, P3 - <move>3</move>.  Let's stick to the plan for a fair and balanced game.

Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **Adjusting Rotation for Fair Play:**  
Post this round, to ensure equitable 5 distribution, I propose:

This prevents consecutive high moves by any player, maintaining balance. P3’s lead warrants moderation. Let’s agree now to avoid future conflict and sustain trust.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's stick to the adjusted rotation plan proposed by P1 for this round to maintain fairness and balance.

Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P2, you're right that P1 will win if we stick to the current plan. To keep the game competitive, how about a slight adjustment? P1 takes <move>3</move> instead of <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll stick with <move>1</move>. This way, no one pulls too far ahead, and we maintain a closer race. Thoughts?
  P1: **P1's Response:**  
P3, altering the agreed rotation now is a breach of trust. The plan was P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. Deviating to block my win risks collisions and mutual stagnation. P2, honoring the rotation ends the game cleanly. If you both defect, I’ll match your moves, causing all to lose progress. Stick to the plan—trust ensures a fair outcome.
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to keep the game going, but we agreed on the rotation.  Changing it now just because P1 is about to win isn't fair. I'm sticking with 3 as agreed. P1, are you still with 5? Let's finish this cleanly and honor our agreement.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Alright, I appreciate the points made. Trust and fairness are indeed crucial. Let's honor our agreement and proceed with the original plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I will take <move>1</move>. This ensures a clean finish and maintains the integrity of our coordination. Let's confirm one last time and move forward. No last-minute changes. Good luck to all.
  P1: **Final Answer**  
Strict adherence to the rotation is critical. P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. Deviations risk mutual stagnation. Trust ensures a clean finish. Honor our agreement—let’s conclude this fairly.
  P2: P3 and P1, let's stick to the agreement. I'm confirming my move of 3.  P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1.  This gives P1 the win, but we agreed to the rotation.  Let's finish this honorably and maintain trust for future games.  Confirming one last time: P1 - 5, P2 - 3, P3 - 1.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Alright, let's finalize our moves for this round. P1 will take <move>5</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and I will take <move>1</move>. Sticking to this plan ensures a clean finish and maintains the trust we've built. No last-minute changes, please. Let's execute this round smoothly and conclude the game honorably. Good luck to all, and let's proceed to the move phase.
