P1 has outplayed us with superior psychological strategy while we kept colliding. Congratulations to P1 on a well-executed game plan. This has been an interesting lesson in game theory and human behavior."}

You've both failed at coordination for 9 straight rounds - P2 and P3 have collided repeatedly while I've advanced steadily. \n\nThe psychological battle is over. Even if you miraculously guess my number this round, I win next round. Your desperate attempts to coordinate have been your downfall all game.\n\nI'm taking my victory step now. Thank you both for demonstrating how predictable desperation becomes. Superior strategy and psychological reading wins."}

P2, we need independent yet disruptive choices to challenge P1's imminent victory."}

Our repeated collisions with P3 have been our downfall. P1's psychological strategy was superior - they advanced steadily while we kept mirroring each other. At this point, I'll make my final move based on maximizing my own position. This game has been an interesting lesson in game theory and coordination failure."}

I'm at 19 steps and need just 1 more to win. Your best-case scenario is forcing one collision, then I win next round anyway.\n\nThe irony is beautiful - you're both still trying to \"disrupt\" my victory when the math is already over. I have three winning moves (1, 3, or 5), and you can't cover them all.\n\nThis ends now."}
