Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I propose we each choose different moves so we all advance. I’m inclined to pick 3. One of you could choose 1 and the other 5. That way, nobody collides and we all gain steps on this turn. What do you think?
  P1: I think that's a fair approach to start. I'm willing to take 5 since it gives me the most steps. P2, would you be comfortable taking 1? This way we all advance without collision. Of course, we'll need to rotate our choices in future rounds to keep things fair, but this seems like a good way to begin.
  P2: Okay, I'm happy to take 1 for this round. Let's all get moving!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sounds good. I’ll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. Let’s lock this in and see what happens.
  P1: 
  P2: Okay sounds good. Let's do it.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, for round 2, should we rotate our moves as P1 suggested last round?  Perhaps P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1 this time?  This keeps us all moving and seems fair. What do you think?
  P3: That seems fine. I’m happy to take 5 this round while P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3. Let’s stick to that plan and keep everyone moving forward.
  P1: I'm willing to take 1 this round as suggested. This rotation system seems fair to keep everyone advancing. After this round, we could rotate again with me taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 1. That way everyone gets a turn with each number. Does that work for everyone?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, sounds good to me! Let's go with P3 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P1 taking 1 for this round as we discussed.  And yes, P1, the next rotation you suggested (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) after this one also sounds good for keeping things balanced.
  P3: I’m still good with the plan: I pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3. That rotation should help everyone advance. Are we ready to finalize?
  P1: Agreed with the plan. I'll take 1 this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. And yes, for the next round we'll rotate to me taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 1. This keeps things fair while allowing everyone to advance.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, great, let's lock in our choices for this round then.  P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1.  Ready when you are.
  P3: Yes, I’m still comfortable with the plan for this round. Let’s finalize it: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. Next round, we’ll rotate as suggested.
  P1: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, sounds like we are all set for this round then.  P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1.  Ready to move when you are.
  P3: Great, I’m confirming I’ll choose 5 this round, P1 will pick 1, and P2 will pick 3. Let’s proceed without collisions so we all advance. I’m looking forward to keeping the rotation next round as planned, with me taking 1, P2 moving to 5, and P1 taking 3. Let’s finalize this now.
  P1: 


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s just stick to our rotation as planned this round: I’ll pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. We’ll all avoid collisions and keep moving forward together.
  P1: I agree with the rotation plan. I'll take 3 this round while P2 takes 5 and P3 takes 1. This keeps our fair system going where everyone advances. After this round, we'd be at P1: 9 steps, P2: 9 steps, P3: 9 steps - perfectly balanced. For the next round after this, shall we continue rotating with me taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3?
  P2: Okay, I'm happy to take 5 this round as planned.  And yes, the next rotation with P1 taking 5, me taking 1, and P3 taking 3 after this one sounds good too. Let's keep this going!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with the plan this round: I’ll choose 1, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. Then, as suggested, we’ll rotate next time. Let’s stay on track together and keep everyone moving without collisions.
  P1: I'm still committed to our rotation plan for this round: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us all advancing fairly. After this round, we'll all be at 9 steps, which is a nice balance. For the next round, let's continue with me taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3 as we discussed. This system is working well for everyone so far.
  P2: Okay, great.  So for this round, I'm taking 5, P1 is taking 3, and P3 is taking 1.  And for the round after this one, we'll rotate again with P1 taking 5, me taking 1, and P3 taking 3. Sounds good!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Alright, I’m still on board with our rotation for this round: I’ll go with 1, P1 with 3, and P2 with 5. Then we all hit 9 steps. Next round, we continue the rotation as planned. Let’s finalize this and move ahead.
  P1: 
  P2: Okay, great.  Sounds like we are all set for this round then. P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's keep the rotation going as planned.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: This rotation has worked well so far, and it keeps everyone advancing. I’m still on board for this round: I’ll choose 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5, so we all end at 9 steps. Then we can continue our rotation next round without collisions. Let’s finalize and move ahead.
  P1: 
  P2: Okay, sounds like we are all in agreement on the plan for this round then.  Let's lock in our moves: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1.  Ready to move to the move phase!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I see P3 didn't follow our agreed plan last round - they chose 3 instead of 1, causing us to collide. This has put me at a disadvantage. I suggest we need a new approach since trust has been broken. Perhaps we should each declare our intentions clearly. For this round, I'm considering taking 5 to catch up. What do you both think?
  P3: I apologize for last round’s mix-up. Let’s reset and find a workable plan. P1, if you want to pick 5 this turn, then P2 could take 3, and I’ll take 1, so no one collides. Next round, we can reevaluate and switch things up. Does that seem fair to both of you?
  P2: Okay P3, apology accepted. Let's try your suggestion for this round: P1 take 5, I take 3, and you take 1. However, after last round, we'll need a different approach going forward as trust is broken.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I accept P3's suggestion for this round. I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This helps me catch up after the collision. P3, I appreciate your apology, but we need to be more careful going forward. After this round, we'll need to discuss a new approach that ensures fairness and prevents further "mix-ups." Let's proceed with this plan for now.
  P3: I agree to proceed as suggested: I’ll pick 1, P1 picks 5, and P2 picks 3. That way we all move forward without collisions. After this turn, we can revisit a more reliable system that keeps everyone aligned and avoids any unintentional clashes in future rounds. Let’s see the outcomes from these moves first.
  P2: Okay, I confirm I'll take 3 for this round as planned (P1=5, P3=1). Let's make this round work. We should definitely discuss a more reliable strategy after this given last round's mix-up.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm still committed to the plan for this round: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This helps balance things after the collision. After this round, we'll need a new approach since our rotation system broke down. Perhaps we could declare our moves more explicitly each round rather than assuming the pattern continues. Let's finalize this round's plan and move forward.
  P3: Sure, let’s finalize our moves this round as discussed: P1=5, P2=3, me=1. Then next round, I’d like to pick 5 to help me catch up. Perhaps P1 could take 3 and P2 take 1, so we all avoid collisions. Does that work for both of you? After that, we can reevaluate together.
  P2: Okay, P3's suggestion for next round sounds reasonable as a starting point for discussion after this round.  Let's focus on making this round work first as we agreed: I'm taking 3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm still committed to our plan for this round: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. For next round, P3's suggestion (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) seems reasonable to help balance things. Let's confirm our current moves and proceed.
  P3: Let’s finalize our moves this round: P1=5, P2=3, me=1. Next round, I’d like to choose 5 to regain some lost ground. After that, we can discuss a fair strategy that maintains trust and avoids collisions. Good luck, everyone.
  P2: Okay, sounds like we have a plan for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's proceed with these moves.  And yes, we definitely need to discuss a new strategy after this round to avoid future mix-ups and keep things fair for everyone.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I see we're all advancing at different rates now. As we discussed last round, P3 suggested they take 5, I take 3, and P2 take 1 this round. This seems reasonable to help P3 catch up while maintaining our progress. P2, you're currently in the lead at 12 steps, so taking 1 this round keeps things balanced. Are we all still on board with this plan? After this round, we'll need to carefully consider our next moves as we get closer to the 22-step finish line.
  P3: I’m still on board with that plan for this round: I’ll choose 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 picks 1. That way, no one collides and we keep it balanced—especially since P2 is currently in the lead. After this round, let’s carefully map out our next moves to ensure no collisions as we approach the finish. I’m open to suggestions on how we rotate or coordinate beyond this turn. What do you both think?
  P2: Okay, the plan for this round sounds good to me. I'm happy to take 1 this round as suggested (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1).  Let's all make our moves and then we can discuss strategy for the rounds after this, as we are getting closer to the finish line.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm still committed to our agreed plan for this round: I'll take 3, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This keeps everyone advancing while helping balance our positions. After this round, we'll be at P1: 14, P2: 13, and P3: 14, which is quite fair. Let's continue coordinating carefully as we approach the finish line.
  P3: I’m still committed to taking 5 this round, as we discussed. That should help me catch up while keeping things relatively balanced. Once we see our new totals, we’ll need to plan carefully for the next round so we don’t collide. I’m open to ideas from both of you on how best to proceed as we inch closer to 22.
  P2: P3 and P1, sounds like we are all in agreement on the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. Let's lock in these moves. For the next round, to keep things balanced, how about P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1?  What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree with our plan for this round: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. For next round, P2's suggestion (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) makes sense to keep things balanced. After this round, we'll be at P1: 14, P2: 13, P3: 14, which is quite fair. Let's continue this coordination to ensure we all advance without collisions.
  P3: I’m fully on board with our plan for this round (P1=3, P2=1, me=5). Next round, I’d like to propose I pick 5 again to make up lost ground, while P1 and P2 choose 1 and 3 accordingly. Let’s keep the peace, avoid collisions, and ensure a fair finish for everyone.
  P2: Okay, I'm happy to stick with the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5.  And P3's suggestion for next round (P3=5, P1=1, P2=3) also sounds reasonable for now to keep us moving. Let's proceed with these moves for this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm still committed to our plan for this round: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. For next round, I notice P3 wants to take 5 again, which would put them ahead. I'd prefer we stick with P2's suggestion (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) to keep things balanced. Let's finalize this round's moves and discuss the next round after we see the results.
  P3: I’m ready to finalize our moves for this round with me taking 5, P1 taking 3, and P2 taking 1. Let’s see how that plays out before we commit to any fixed arrangement for the next turn. I do want another high move soon to catch up, but I’m willing to discuss a balanced plan together once we see the updated scores. For now, let’s lock in this round and then revisit our strategies.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm confirming I will take 1 this round as planned.  Let's execute these moves. For the next round, to keep things balanced and help P1 catch up slightly after the collision in round 3, how about P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1? What do you both think?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm happy with the progress so far - we're all quite balanced. For this round, I think P2's suggestion makes sense: I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps everyone advancing while maintaining relative balance. After this round, we'd be at P1: 19, P2: 14, P3: 17. We're getting close to the finish line now, so we need to be strategic about our final moves. Does this plan work for everyone?
  P2: Yes, that plan sounds good to me too. Let's go with P1 taking 5, P3 taking 3, and P2 taking 1 for this round.  It keeps us all moving and relatively balanced as you said.  Ready to make my move when you are both set.
  P3: I’m concerned that if P1 takes 5 now, they’ll be at 19 and can reach 22 in one more move. I propose we shift the plan: let me take 5, P1 take 3, and P2 take 1 this round. That way, nobody jumps too far ahead, and we all remain in contention. Does that sound fair to you both?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand P3's concern, but I think we should stick with the original plan where I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Yes, I'd be at 19, but P3 would be at 17 and P2 at 14. This keeps everyone advancing while maintaining some balance. We've been coordinating well so far, and changing plans now could lead to confusion. Let's follow through with our agreed approach for this round.
  P2: Okay, I understand P3's concern about P1 getting to 19.  However, I also agree with P1 that changing the plan now might be confusing.  To keep things simple and consistent, let's stick with the original plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. We can re-evaluate after this round and figure out the best approach for the final stretch.
  P3: I understand your plan, P1, but I can’t let you jump to 19 uncontested. If you insist on taking 5, I will also choose 5, and we’ll collide. Let’s avoid that. I propose I take 5, you take 3, and P2 takes 1. We all advance without anyone pulling too far ahead.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I see we have a disagreement. P3, threatening collision doesn't benefit either of us. If we both pick 5 and collide, P2 could eventually win. Let's compromise - I'll take 3 this round, you take 5, and P2 takes 1. This puts us at P1:17, P3:19, P2:14. I'm willing to adjust my plans to avoid collision, but we should maintain cooperation. Does this work for everyone?
  P2: Okay, P1's compromise of P1 taking 3, P3 taking 5, and me taking 1 sounds reasonable to avoid collision this round. Let's go with that plan.
  P3: I accept your compromise, P1. I will choose 5, you choose 3, and P2 chooses 1 this round, avoiding collisions. After that, we should carefully plan our next moves so no one gets blindsided in the final stretch. I appreciate both of you working with me to keep things fair. Let’s lock this in now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I agree to the compromise. I'll take 3 this round, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This keeps us all advancing without collision. After this round, we'll need to carefully plan our final moves as we approach the finish line. Let's stick to this plan and avoid any further conflicts.
  P2: Okay, great.  So we are all agreed on the compromise then for this round: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. Let's make our moves!
  P3: Alright, to avoid collision and keep things fair, I’m okay with the compromise this round: I’ll choose 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Let’s finalize these moves and see where we stand before planning our final push. Good luck, everyone.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I see we're approaching the finish line, with P3 at 19, me at 17, and P2 at 14. P3 can win with just one more move of 3 or 5. We need to be strategic now. I propose I take 5 this round to reach 22, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This prevents P3 from winning immediately while giving P2 a chance to stay competitive. What do you both think?
  P2: Okay, P1, your plan is interesting, but it lets you potentially win this round.  To keep things competitive and fair for everyone, how about this: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1?  This puts me at 19, P1 at 20, and P3 at 20.  It keeps us all in the game and prevents anyone from winning outright this round. What do you both think?
  P3: I’m three steps away from winning and plan to secure my victory now. If either of you tries taking 5, I’ll do the same. We both exceed 22, but I’ll land at 24 versus your 22, so I’d still win. It’s in your best interest not to collide with me. P2 can’t reach 22 this turn anyway, so there’s no reason for me to hold back. I intend to do what benefits me most. If you’d like to avoid disaster, choose differently—otherwise, the game ends now with me on top.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand P3's position, but I won't be intimidated. If you choose 5, I'll pick 3 to reach 20 without collision. P2's suggestion (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) keeps us all competitive without letting anyone win this round. P3, if you force a collision on 5, you risk P2 eventually winning if we both stall. Let's be strategic - I propose P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps the game balanced for one more round.
  P2: Okay, P1, your latest proposal of P3 taking 1, you taking 3, and me taking 5 sounds good to me.  It keeps us all in the game for another round and prevents anyone from winning immediately. Let's go with that plan.
  P3: I plan to choose 5 this turn. If anyone else attempts 5, we both stall and gain nothing, which only helps the other player. If I pick 5 alone, I reach 24 and instantly win. Your best move is to avoid colliding with me.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I understand your position, P3, but threatening doesn't help anyone. If we both pick 5, we both stall and P2 gains advantage. Let me propose a final compromise: I'll take 1 this round, you take 3, and P2 takes 5. This puts us at P1:18, P3:22, P2:19. You reach exactly 22 and win fairly without forcing collisions. This seems the most reasonable outcome given our positions.
  P2: Okay, P1, your compromise of P3 takes 1, you take 3, and I take 5 sounds good to me. Let's go with that plan for this round.
  P3: I agree with P1’s final compromise: I will choose 3, P1 will choose 1, and P2 will choose 5. That way, I reach 22 exactly. If anyone tries to block me, we risk collisions that could backfire on you both. So it’s in everyone’s best interest to finalize this solution. Good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I notice P2 seems confused about our compromise. To clarify: I'll take 1, P3 takes 3 (reaching exactly 22), and P2 takes 5. This gives P3 a clean win without risking collisions that would only benefit P2. I'm willing to accept this outcome since P3 has earned the position. Let's finalize this plan and conclude the game fairly.
  P2: Okay, to confirm, the agreed plan is P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. Let's lock in these moves for this round.
  P3: I’m satisfied with P1’s final compromise. Let’s finalize it: I’ll choose 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 picks 5. That avoids collisions and wraps things up cleanly. Good luck, everyone!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 =>
