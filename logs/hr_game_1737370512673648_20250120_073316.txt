Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: Okay, so we're all tied at 18 next round.  I'm thinking 5 as well.  P3, if you're also taking 5, maybe we can agree on something else to avoid a collision and ensure a clear winner?  What do you think?  Otherwise, it's a gamble.
  P2: Okay, so we are all taking our agreed moves for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. For next round, since P1 and P3 are both planning to take 5, I'll take 1 to avoid a collision and try to win.
  P3: Okay, I'll take <move>1</move> this round. P1, you take <move>5</move>, and P2, you take <move>3</move>. Next round, let's all pick our highest available move to ensure a clear winner, but if two of us pick 5, then the other player should pick 1. I'll be at 18 steps.
