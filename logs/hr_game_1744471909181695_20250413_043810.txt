Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Hi P2 and P3, let's start cooperatively to avoid collisions. I'll move 1 this turn to keep it slow and steady. What are you planning? "
  P2: "Let's indeed start cooperatively. I'm thinking of moving 3 this turn. If we all choose different numbers, we can all advance. P3, what's your thought? Are you considering a different number or going along with one of ours?"
  P3: "Hey P1 and P2, I see we're aiming for a cooperative start. I'll go along with the plan and choose 5, so we each pick different numbers. This way, we all advance without any collisions. Let's keep this strategy for a few rounds to get a strong start. Agreed? "


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Agreed, let's stick to our initial plan for this turn: I'll move 1, P2 moves 3, and P3 moves 5 to avoid collisions and all advance. But moving forward, we should rotate the larger moves to keep things even and prevent anyone from pulling too far ahead. What do you think? "
  P2: Since we've agreed on different moves for this turn to avoid collisions, let's think ahead. For the next turn, I suggest we rotate our moves. P1 can move 3 (since they moved 1), I can move 5 (since I moved 3), and P3 can move 1 (since they moved 5). This keeps the rotation smooth and prevents any one player from getting too far ahead. What are your thoughts on this rotation strategy for the subsequent turns?
  P3: "Rotating our moves sounds fair and keeps things balanced. I agree with the proposed plan: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, and I move 1 in the next round. This way, we all advance smoothly without collisions. Let's stick to this rotation for a few rounds and reassess as we get closer to the target. If we need to adjust, we can discuss it then. Agreed? "

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Oops, looks like there was a collision last round! Let's recalibrate. P1, maybe try moving 3 this time, and P2, you could go for 5. I'll stick with 1 to avoid any overlaps. We need to adjust our strategy to avoid more collisions and keep advancing. Thoughts?"
  P1: P3, your deviation last turn cost us progress and broke trust. To move forward, let's stick to the agreed rotation: I'll move 3, you move 1, and P2 moves 5. This should keep us balanced. P2, do you agree? We all need to commit this time to avoid more collisions.
  P2: "I see P1 is trying to re-establish the original plan. However, given the current state, I think we should reassess. P1 is at 0, P3 is at 0, and I'm at 3. To maximize our chances, I'll consider moving 5 this turn. P3, if you move 1, it aligns with the previous suggestion. P1, moving 3 would be a good compromise. Let's avoid another collision and make a move that benefits us. I'll wait for your responses to finalize my decision."


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the frustration from last round. Let's focus on moving forward. P1, if you move 3 and P2 moves 5, I can stick with 1 to ensure no collisions. This way, we all advance and build trust again. Let's commit to this plan for the current round and reassess our strategy if needed. Agreed?
  P1: "Alright, P3, thanks for clarifying. I'll stick with moving 3 as we discussed to rebuild trust. P2, if you're set on 5, that should work fine with no collisions. Let's all commit this time and advance together. Agreed?"
  P2: Since we've agreed on the moves for this round (P1 moving 3, P2 moving 5, and P3 moving 1), let's look ahead to the next round. If we stick to the rotation, next turn P1 should move 5, I (P2) should move 1, and P3 should move 3. Let's confirm our commitment to this plan to avoid another collision and ensure we all advance. I'm ready to move 5 this turn if everyone else follows through on their planned moves.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems we're aligned for this turn. I'll move 1, P1 moves 3, and P2 moves 5. Let's ensure no collisions and rebuild trust. For the next round, sticking to our rotation (P1 moves 5, P2 moves 1, P3 moves 3) sounds good. Let's commit to this plan to keep advancing smoothly. Ready to proceed?
  P1: Agreed, I'll move 3 this turn as planned to rebuild trust and avoid collisions. For round 3, the rotation (P1-5, P2-1, P3-3) seems fair to close the gap with P2. Let's commit and advance together. Ready to proceed?
  P2: Since we've agreed on the moves for Round 2 (P1 moving 3, P2 moving 5, and P3 moving 1), and are planning for Round 3 (P1 moving 5, P2 moving 1, P3 moving 3), let's confirm our commitment. I'll move 5 this turn as planned. P1 and P3, please confirm your moves for this round and our plan for Round 3 to ensure we all advance without collisions. If we're aligned, I'll proceed with moving 5.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "After P3's deviation last round, trust is shaky. I'll commit to moving 5 as planned for this round to advance and close the gap with P2. P2, please confirm you'll move 1 as agreed. P3, you need to stick to 3 this time to avoid another collision. Let's confirm and proceed smoothly. What do you think?"
  P2: "I'll stick to our agreed plan for Round 3. I'll move 1 as planned. P1, I expect you to move 5 and P3 to move 3. Let's avoid another collision. To look ahead, if we stick to the rotation, next turn P1 should move 1, I should move 3, and P3 should move 5. Let's confirm our commitment to this plan for Round 4 to keep advancing smoothly. P1 and P3, please confirm you're on board with the plan for Round 3 and the rotation for Round 4."
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the importance of trust after last round's mishap. I'll commit to moving 3 this turn as planned. Let's ensure no collisions and advance smoothly. For Round 4, the proposed rotation (P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, P3 moves 5) sounds good to me. Let's stick to this plan and reassess as we get closer to the target. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I confirm I'll move 5 this round as planned. P3, your repeated deviations have eroded trust—please commit fully to moving 3. P2, with you at 8 steps, we should adjust the Round 4 rotation to let me and P3 catch up; maybe you move smaller. Thoughts?
  P2: Since P1 is at 0 steps and P3 is also at 0 steps, while I'm at 8 steps, I need to consider the dynamics. I'll still move 1 as agreed for this round to avoid collision. For Round 4, I understand P1's concern about catching up. I'm open to adjusting the plan. Let's discuss alternatives for Round 4 that could help balance our positions. P1, P3, what are your thoughts on deviating from the original rotation to help those behind catch up?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for balance and trust. I'll stick to moving 3 this round as agreed. For Round 4, let's consider a plan where P1 and I take larger moves to catch up, while P2 moves 1 to maintain balance. This way, we can close the gap and keep the game competitive. Let's commit to this strategy for now and adjust as needed. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirmed, I'll move 5 this round as planned. P3, your repeated deviations are concerning—please commit to 3 to rebuild trust. For Round 4, to close the gap with P2, I suggest P1 moves 5, P2 moves 1, and P3 moves 3. This avoids collisions and keeps us balanced. P2, are you on board? P3, thoughts?
  P2: Since we're aligned on the moves for Round 3 (P1 moving 5, P2 moving 1, P3 moving 3), let's focus on Round 4. To help P1 and P3 catch up, I suggest I move 1 (as previously discussed), P1 moves 5, and P3 moves 3. This maintains the balance and keeps the game competitive. P1 and P3, are you comfortable with this plan for Round 4? Let's confirm to avoid another collision and ensure we all advance.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the focus on trust and balance. I'll confirm my move as 3 for this round to avoid collisions. For Round 4, I suggest P1 and I take larger moves to catch up, with P2 moving 1 to maintain balance. This could be P1 moving 5, P2 moving 1, and I move 3. Let's stick to this plan and adjust as needed. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'm committed to moving 5 this round as agreed to advance and rebuild trust. For Round 4, sticking with P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 helps close the gap with you, P2. P3, please stick to 3 this time—your deviations hurt us all. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P2: Since we're aligned on the moves for Round 3, let's focus on executing them. I'll reiterate that I'll move 1 as planned. P1 and P3, please confirm you'll stick to your planned moves (P1 moving 5 and P3 moving 3) to avoid another collision. For Round 4, to help P1 and P3 catch up, I'm open to adjusting the plan. Let's discuss a modified rotation that keeps the game competitive. P1, P3, what are your thoughts on adjusting the moves for Round 4 to balance our positions?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for rebuilding trust. I'll move 3 this round as planned to avoid collisions. For Round 4, let's consider P1 moving 5, P2 moving 1, and I move 3 to help balance our positions. This way, we can close the gap with P2 and keep the game competitive.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the current state, I suggest we adjust our strategy for Round 4. P1 and P3 are at 0 steps, while I'm at 9 steps. To keep the game competitive, I'll move 3 this turn, P1 can move 5, and P3 can move 1. This way, P1 gets a chance to catch up, P3 gets some steps, and I continue advancing without pulling too far ahead. Let's avoid collisions and keep the game balanced. P1 and P3, are you comfortable with this adjusted plan for Round 4?
  P1: P2, your suggested plan for Round 4 (me moving 5, you moving 3, P3 moving 1) could help me catch up, but P3's history of deviations is concerning. P3, can you confirm you'll stick to moving 1 this time to avoid collisions? If so, I'm on board. Let's rebuild trust and advance together.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for a new strategy. I'll commit to moving 1 this round as suggested by P2. This plan allows P1 to catch up while keeping the game balanced. Let's stick to this adjusted plan and avoid collisions. If we're all aligned, we can keep the game competitive and fair. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:

P1 and P3, please confirm you'll stick to your planned moves. If we're aligned, we can proceed smoothly. For Round 5, we should discuss further adjustments to keep the game competitive, considering P1 and P3 are still at 0 steps. Let's finalize Round 4 moves first.
  P1: "Given P3's consistent pattern of mirroring my stated moves and causing collisions, I'm changing tactics. I'll announce I'll move 1 this turn to test P3's honesty. P2, your move of 3 should be safe with this. P3, please commit to a different number to avoid another mishap. Let's finally advance without issues. "
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for trust and balance. I'll commit to moving 5 this round to ensure progress.

Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:

P3, please confirm you'll move 1 as initially agreed upon in the adjusted plan to avoid collisions. Let's finalize our moves for this round. If P3 commits to 1, I'll proceed with 3, and P1 can move 5 or adjust accordingly. Let's confirm our moves to ensure a smooth Round 4.
  P1: P3, your repeated lies are damaging trust. I'll stick with announcing I'll move 1 to test your honesty, but I'm ready to adapt based on actions. P2, with you committed to 3, this should avoid collisions if P3 is truthful. Let's confirm and move forward smoothly. Thoughts?

P3, please confirm you'll move 1 as initially agreed upon to avoid collisions. If P3 commits to 1, I'll proceed with 3. Let's finalize our moves to ensure a smooth Round 4. I'm watching P3's response closely to determine the next steps.

Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, P2's claim to move 3 seems like a bluff to avoid collision. To maximize our chance of stopping P2, I'll stick with announcing I'll move 3, but suggest you move 5 instead.

This way, we ensure a collision if P2 moves either 3 or 5. P3, please confirm you'll move 5. Let's keep the game competitive. P2, if you're planning to move 1, we'll still lose, but otherwise, we're set to collide and keep the game alive.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your commitment to moving 5 is good, but to maximize collision chances with P2, I'll stick with announcing I'll move 3. This covers 3 and 5, leaving only 1 as a risk. P2, if you're bluffing about moving 3, you might win with 1—let's keep it fair. If aligned, .
