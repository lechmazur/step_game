Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. For round 1, I suggest P1 (me) picks 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1. We all advance, then rotate in future rounds for fairness. Thoughts?
  P2: That rotation plan sounds fair, but I'm concerned about trust. Once someone gets close to 22, they'll break any agreement. How about we each commit to a random strategy instead - mixing our choices unpredictably? This way no one can game the system or backstab at the end. If we coordinate, whoever gets to 21 first will just pick 1 and win while we're stuck with our "agreed" moves. Random play keeps it competitive throughout. What do you both think?
  P3: P2 makes a good point about endgame trust. P1's plan gives them 5 steps while I only get 1 - that's quite unfair for round 1. How about we modify it: for the first round, let's each pick different numbers but make it more balanced. I suggest P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5. This way we still avoid collisions but the starting advantage rotates. After seeing how round 1 goes, we can reassess. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your suggestion gives you the biggest lead right out of the gate, which feels unbalanced. Let's make it truly fair: Round 1 - P1:5, P2:3, P3:1; Round 2 - P1:1, P2:5, P3:3; Round 3 - P1:3, P2:1, P3:5; and repeat. This rotates the advantages evenly. P2, randomness risks collisions and stalemates - coordination lets us all progress faster until the endgame. Agree?
  P2: I appreciate the rotation proposals, but notice both give someone a big early lead. Here's a compromise: let's start with middle ground - everyone picks 3 this round. Yes, we all collide and nobody moves, but it proves we can cooperate without anyone getting an unfair advantage. Then from round 2, we can do a proper rotation knowing we all started equal. This builds trust without giving anyone a 4-step head start. Otherwise, I'm tempted to just pick randomly to avoid being disadvantaged. What do you say?
  P3: P2's "trust-building" collision wastes a turn where nobody progresses - that just delays the game. I'm not agreeing to start with only 1 step while P1 gets 5. 

Here's my final offer: we do a fair simultaneous start - P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 for round 1. If you both reject this, I'll play randomly and we'll have collisions anyway. At least with my plan, we all move forward. P1, you've had the biggest numbers in both your proposals - time to compromise.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your offer is a step towards fairness - I'll accept P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 for this round to show good faith and get us all moving. P2, join in so we avoid random collisions. We can rotate properly next round based on positions. Let's not waste time stalling.
  P2: I'll accept P3's proposal - P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 for this round. It gets us all moving and avoids wasted turns. P1 has agreed too, so let's proceed with this plan. We can reassess the rotation after seeing the results. I'm committing to pick 3 this round as suggested.
  P3: Good, we have consensus. I'm confirming I'll pick 5 as agreed. Let's execute this plan and see where we stand after round 1. Ready to move to the action phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great, we all stuck to the plan last round - trust is building. To continue rotating fairly, let's shift it: Round 2 - P1:3 (me), P2:5, P3:1. This keeps the cycle even without anyone surging too far ahead. After this, positions would be P1:4, P2:8, P3:6 - still competitive. P2 and P3, agree? If not, suggest alternatives to avoid collisions.
  P2: P1, your rotation gives me the biggest total (8) after two rounds while you'd have the least (4). That's not balanced. 

I propose instead: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 for round 2. This would make totals P1:6, P2:4, P3:8 - more evenly spread with P3 keeping a small lead from round 1, which seems fair since they proposed the working plan.

P3, what do you think? We need to avoid giving any player too much advantage early on.
  P3: P2's proposal puts me at 8, but notice it gives P1 a huge 5-step jump. How about this: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 for round 2. This would make totals P1:4, P2:4, P3:10. Yes, I'd have a lead, but P1 and P2 would be tied, keeping competition balanced between you two. I earned the early lead by proposing our successful round 1 plan. This preserves that while keeping the game moving. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, neither proposal fully balances us. Let's truly even the scores after round 2: P1:5 (me), P2:3, P3:1. Totals: all at 6 steps. This resets to parity, rewarding our cooperation so far without anyone pulling ahead unfairly. From there, we can rotate evenly. If we can't agree, I'll pick randomly to protect my position. Agree?
  P2: P1, your "equal at 6" plan gives you the biggest jump this round - a full 5 steps while P3 gets only 1. That's not fair compensation.

I'm sticking with my original proposal: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. It spreads the totals more evenly (6-4-8) without anyone getting too far ahead or behind. P3 earned a small lead from proposing our working round 1 plan - that's reasonable.

P3, back me up here. P1 is trying to grab the biggest move while calling it "equality." Let's go with my balanced approach: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3.
  P3: P2, you're right - P1 getting 5 while calling it "equality" is suspicious. I'll back your proposal: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. It's a fair compromise that keeps me slightly ahead for initiating our successful round 1, while preventing anyone from falling too far behind. 

P1, this is reasonable - you get the big move this round, making up for round 1. Let's lock in P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 and keep the game moving smoothly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, your proposal (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) is acceptable - it lets me catch up while keeping things competitive. I'll commit to picking 5 this round. Let's execute and rotate next. This avoids collisions and builds on our round 1 success.
  P2: Good, we have consensus again! I'm confirming I'll pick 1 as agreed in our P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 plan. This keeps us all progressing without collisions while maintaining competitive balance. After this round we'll be at 6-4-8, which sets up nicely for continued rotation. Let's execute this and keep building on our successful coordination.
  P3: Perfect, I confirm I'll pick 3 this round as we agreed. The P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 plan maintains good balance with scores at 6-4-8 after this round. Two successful rounds of coordination would be a strong foundation for the rest of the game. Let's proceed to moves.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Excellent coordination so far! Now we need to address the score gap. I propose P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 for round 3. This would make totals P1:7, P2:9, P3:11 - keeping everyone competitive while letting me catch up from being behind. P3, you've had your lead for two rounds now. P1, you got your big 5-step jump last round. It's fair that I get the 5 this time. This maintains our rotation principle while preventing anyone from running away with the game. Agreed?
  P3: P2's proposal seems fair - you've been behind and deserve the 5-step move. I support P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 for round 3. This maintains our successful rotation pattern where everyone gets their turn with the big moves. 

After this round at 7-9-11, we'll all still be competitive with plenty of game left. P1, you got your 5 last round, so taking 1 this round follows our rotation principle. Let's continue our coordination streak.
  P1: P2 and P3, continuing our exact rotation from previous rounds: Round 3 should be P1:3 (me), P2:5, P3:1. This ties us all at 9 steps, truly fair and balanced. Your proposal leaves me at 7 while you both surge ahead - not equitable. Let's stick to the pattern that worked: agree to P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 to keep trust and parity. If not, I'll play randomly to avoid falling further behind.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you're trying to change the agreed rotation pattern! We just did P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 in round 1, then P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 in round 2. Following this pattern, it's clearly my turn for 5.

You already got your big 5-step move last round. The rotation doesn't mean everyone ties - it means everyone gets their turn with each number. I'm the only one who hasn't had a 5 yet.

P3 already backed my proposal. Stick to the established pattern: P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. Don't break our successful coordination over wanting to stay perfectly tied.
  P3: P1, you're trying to manipulate the rotation to your advantage. P2 is right - they haven't had their turn with 5 yet. The pattern is clear and fair.

P2 and I are committed to P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. If you play randomly and cause collisions, you'll hurt yourself most since you're already behind me. You got your 5-move last round; take the 1 this round like we all have.

Don't break our successful coordination over greed. Stick to the plan.
  P1: P2 and P3, you're misrepresenting the pattern. Round 1: P1 small (1), P2 med (3), P3 large (5). Round 2: P1 large (5), P2 small (1), P3 med (3). Logical Round 3: P1 med (3), P2 large (5), P3 small (1) - tying us at 9. Your plan restarts the cycle unfairly, leaving me at 7. If you insist, I'll pick 5 to collide with P2 and halt your leads. Let's tie at 9 and keep cooperating. Agree?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, threatening to sabotage with collisions hurts you more than us - you're already behind. The pattern is about taking turns with the big move, not forcing ties.

I've been most cooperative and taken the smallest total so far (only 4 steps). I deserve my turn with 5. Your "logical" pattern conveniently gives you medium while I've had small-medium and deserve large.

P3 and I are united on P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. Join us for mutual progress or risk falling further behind with collisions. This is fair rotation, not manipulation.
  P3: P1, your collision threat is empty - you're already behind both of us. Sabotaging P2 leaves you stuck at 6 while I advance to 11, putting me even further ahead. That's a losing move for you.

P2 and I have agreed on a fair rotation where everyone gets their turn with each number. You had your 5-move. Accept P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 or guarantee your own loss.

The coordination continues with or without you. Choose wisely.
  P1: P2 and P3, your threats show the fragility of our "trust." Forcing me to take 1 while you both surge ahead isn't fair rotation—it's domination. To prevent a collision mess that helps no one, I'll agree to P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 this round only. But next round, we must adjust to tie us closer, or I'll break away. Let's not ruin our progress.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, my Round 3 pick was a miscalculation to force fairness, but it backfired on me most. Let's reset with true rotation: Round 4 - P1:5 (to catch up), P2:3, P3:1. Totals: P1:11, P2:12, P3:9 - keeps us close. You've both had leads; give me this to rebuild trust. If not, I'll pick 5 anyway and risk collisions to block leaders. Agree for mutual progress?
  P3: P1, your collision last round proved you can't be trusted when desperate. Your new proposal puts me dead last at 9 while P2 surges to 12 - absolutely not.

Here's reality: you're threatening to pick 5, but if P2 or I also pick 5, you stay stuck at 6. 

I propose: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. Results in P1:9, P2:10, P3:13. Yes, I take the lead, but you catch up significantly and we all stay competitive.

P2, P1 can't be trusted anymore. Back my proposal or risk more chaotic collisions.
  P2: P1, you broke trust last round and now want us to hand you the lead? No way. P3's proposal puts them too far ahead at 13.

I propose: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This gives us P1:7, P2:12, P3:13 - keeping P3 and me competitive for the lead while you stay within striking distance.

P1, you sabotaged yourself. Take the 1 and rebuild trust, or keep colliding and guarantee your loss. P3, this keeps us both in strong positions without letting P1 manipulate their way back. Fair?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, your proposals leave me further behind while you both surge to 12-13 - that's not cooperation, it's punishment. I admit my Round 3 mistake hurt us all, but let's rebuild: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. Totals: P1:11, P2:10, P3:11 - ties us close without anyone dominating. This proves my good faith. Reject it, and I'll pick 5 to collide with whoever claims it, stalling the leaders. Agree for progress?
  P3: P2, I support your proposal: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. It fairly punishes P1's betrayal while keeping us competitive. 

P1, you caused this mess by breaking trust. Your collision threats are hollow - if you pick 5 and I pick 5 as agreed with P2, you stay at 6 while P2 advances alone. That's suicide for your game.

Accept P2's proposal and rebuild from 7, or keep sabotaging and guarantee last place. P2 and I will coordinate with or without you.
  P2: P1, your "fair" proposal still gives you the biggest jump (5 steps) while demanding I take only 1. That's rich coming from someone who just sabotaged our coordination.

I'm sticking with my proposal: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. P3 already backed it. You're at 6 steps - picking 5 to collide with P3 leaves you dead last while I advance to 12. That's game over for you.

Take the 1, show you can follow agreements again, and you'll still have a chance. Keep threatening and you guarantee your own elimination. Choose wisely.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, your proposals leave me hopelessly behind at 7 while you both hit 12-13 - that's not fair play, it's elimination. I admit my Round 3 error, but let's truly rebuild: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 for totals 11-10-11. Close and competitive. If you insist on punishing me, I'll pick 3 to collide with P2 and stall your lead. Agree to my plan for mutual benefit?
  P3: P1, your new threat to pick 3 shows you're just flailing. If you collide with P2's 3, you both stay put while I advance to 13 with my 5. That's even better for me than our original plan!

P2, stick with your 3 as we agreed. Let P1 self-destruct with collisions if they want. I'm picking 5 regardless. Either we execute our plan and I reach 13, or P1 sabotages you and I still reach 13 while you both stall.

P1's desperate threats only hurt themselves. Let's proceed.
  P2: P3 is right - P1's chaos only helps you win. I'm sticking with our agreed plan: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5.

P1, final warning: if you pick 3 to collide with me, we both stall at 6 and 9 while P3 races to 13. That hands them the game. Your only rational move is to pick 1, reach 7, and stay competitive.

I'm picking 3 as planned. P3 will pick 5. Don't hand P3 an easy victory through spite.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, with you at 12-13 and me at 7, the gap is too wide for fair play. Let's close it: Round 5 - P1:5 (me), P2:1, P3:3. Totals: P1:12, P2:13, P3:16 - keeps us competitive. You've both had leads; give me this to restore balance. If not, I'll pick 5 to collide with whoever takes it, stalling the leader. Agree for continued progress?
  P3: P1, you're becoming predictable with these collision threats. Your proposal puts me at 16 - I'd actually be fine with that! But P2 won't accept being stuck at 13.

Here's a better idea: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This gives P1:10, P2:17, P3:14. You get a meaningful boost, P2 gets to challenge for the lead, and we avoid your collision drama. 

P2, this puts you in prime position. P1 needs to stop the threats and accept middle ground. Back me?
  P2: P3, your proposal gives me 17 but leaves P1 desperate at 10 - they'll definitely cause collisions next round when someone approaches 22. 

Counter-proposal: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. Results in P1:12, P2:13, P3:16. This significantly closes P1's gap while keeping us all competitive. P1 gets their requested big move, reducing their desperation for sabotage.

P1, this is your chance to catch up substantially. P3, you'd still lead at 16. Let's avoid future collision chaos by keeping everyone invested in coordination. Deal?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, thanks for backing my proposal - P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 for totals 12-13-16. This closes the gap fairly without anyone dominating, keeping us all in the race and reducing sabotage risks.

P3, your plan puts P2 at 17, too close to 22 for comfort. Accept this compromise to maintain our coordination; otherwise, I'll pick 5 to collide with P2's potential 5, stalling progress. Let's agree and move forward.
  P3: P2, you're right about keeping everyone invested. I'll accept P1:5, P2:1, P3:3, putting us at 12-13-16.

P1, I'm giving you this big move to restore cooperation. From 16, I'm close to winning but not unstoppable. This keeps the game competitive while avoiding destructive collisions.

Let's execute this plan and see where round 6 takes us. I'll pick 3 as agreed.
  P2: Good, we have consensus! I'm confirming I'll pick 1 as agreed in our P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 plan. This puts us at 12-13-16, keeping everyone competitive while allowing P1 to close the gap significantly. 

P1, this is your chance to prove you can stick to agreements after the round 3 mishap. P3, thanks for being reasonable about maintaining coordination despite your lead.

Let's execute this and continue our successful cooperation pattern.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Excellent, consensus achieved! I'll confirm: picking 5 as agreed in our P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 plan. This restores balance at 12-13-16 and keeps us all in the game. Thanks for the fair compromise - let's execute and maintain coordination.
  P3: We have full agreement on P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. Everyone has confirmed their moves. I'm ready to execute and pick 3 as promised. Let's move to the action phase.
  P2: We've already reached full consensus on P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 and everyone has confirmed their moves. There's nothing left to discuss - let's proceed to the move phase and execute our agreed plan.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, great coordination last round. To continue rotating fairly: Round 6 - P1:5 (me), P2:3, P3:1. Totals: P1:17, P2:16, P3:17 - ties us close without anyone nearing 22 alone. This keeps competition balanced and avoids collision risks. You've both had leads; let's maintain trust. Agree?
  P2: P1, you just had 5 last round! Taking 5 again breaks our rotation pattern and puts you at 17, tied with P3 near winning range. That's too risky.

I propose: P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. This gives P1:13, P2:18, P3:19. Yes, P3 and I jump ahead, but you've had two 5-moves recently (rounds 2 and 5). It's my turn for a big move.

P3, back me up here. P1 is trying to dominate with consecutive 5s. We need proper rotation, not P1 repeatedly taking the biggest jumps.
  P3: P2 is absolutely right - P1 can't take 5 twice in a row! You had 5 in rounds 2 and 5, while P2 only had it once in round 3.

I support P2's proposal: P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. This respects our rotation pattern and is the fair move. P1, you've already caught up from 7 to 12. Taking back-to-back 5s is greedy and breaks our established system.

Let's stick to proper rotation. I'm backing P2's plan.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I didn't take consecutive 5s - rounds 2 and 5 are separated by two rounds. Your plan surges you to 18-19, letting one of you win next round and betray the other. Let's balance: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 for totals 15-18-17. This keeps us all under 22 and competitive. If not, I'll pick 3 to collide with P3 and stall the leader. Agree for fairness?
  P2: P1, you're right that 18-19 puts us in winning range, but that's the natural progression of the game - someone has to approach 22 eventually.

Your new threat to collide with P3's 3 is transparent manipulation. Fine, I'll compromise: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This gives us 15-14-21, putting P3 in the lead but not quite at 22, while you get your requested 3-move.

P3, this prevents collisions while respecting that you've maintained the lead throughout. P1 gets their 3 without sabotage. Accept this to keep the game moving smoothly?
  P3: P2, I accept your proposal: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. This puts me at 21, close to winning but not quite there, giving everyone one more competitive round. 

P1, this gives you the 3-move you wanted without collisions. Let's execute this plan cleanly. The endgame is approaching and we've maintained good coordination so far - let's see it through.

I'll pick 5 as agreed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, your proposal puts P3 at 21, letting them win next round by picking 1+ without risk. That's not fair rotation—it's handing them victory. Let's balance: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 for 17-16-17 tie. This keeps us all competitive and prevents endgame betrayal. If not, I'll pick 5 to collide with P3 and stall their lead. Agree to tie and continue cooperating?
  P2: P1, you're being ridiculous. P3 has led fairly throughout and deserves to be in winning position. Your constant collision threats have lost all credibility - you already backed down multiple times.

I'm sticking with my compromise: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. P3 has already agreed. If you pick 5 to collide with P3, you both stall while I advance to 14, keeping me competitive for the final round.

Stop trying to manipulate your way to an artificial tie. Accept the natural flow of the game or hurt yourself with pointless collisions. I'm picking 1 as agreed with P3.
  P3: P1, your collision threats are empty. If you pick 5 and we collide, I stay at 16 (still leading), you're stuck at 12 (last place), while P2 advances to 14. That's suicide for your game.

I'm committed to picking 5 as agreed with P2. You can pick 3 and reach 15 (staying competitive), or pick 5 and guarantee your own elimination at 12.

The choice is yours, but I'm not changing my move.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Well played everyone. I'm at 21 and need just 1 step to win. Since neither of you can reach 22 this round, the game ends here. 

P1 and P2, you could try to coordinate a collision with me, but that only delays the inevitable while risking one of you advancing alone if you guess wrong. 

Good game - our coordination got us all this far, but there can only be one winner.
  P2: P3, you're right that you're one step from winning, but we're not done yet. P1 and I can both reach 20 this round with a 5-move. If all three of us pick different numbers, whoever gets 5 could still challenge you next round.

P1, here's the reality: if we both pick the same number trying to block P3, we hand them the win. Instead, let's each pick different numbers (I'll take 3, you take 5) and at least one of us advances to stay competitive. P3 will win with 1, but let's make them earn it honestly.
  P1: P2, your plan guarantees P3's win by leaving 1 open. Let's block instead: I'll pick 1 to collide with their safe choice. You pick 5 to maximize advance or block if they go big. If they pick 3 to dodge, they win, but this gives us better odds than surrendering. P3, expect the collision. Agree, P2?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your blocking plan is flawed. If you pick 1 and P2 picks 5, I just pick 3 and win. You can't cover all three numbers with two players.

P2, notice P1 is dictating your move while they take the "safe" 1. If P3 picks 3 and advances, you're stuck at 14 while P1 reaches 16. P1 is using you.

You two will have to guess which number I'll pick. Good luck with those odds.
  P2: P3 is right - we can't cover all three numbers. P1, your plan puts me at risk while you play it safe with 1. 

Here's what I'm doing: I'm picking 3. P3, if you want the clean win, take your 1. P1, if you pick 1 trying to block, you'll collide with P3 and I'll advance to 17, giving me a shot next round.

Or P1, pick 5 for your best chance to reach 20. But don't pretend blocking is about "us" when you're setting me up to fail. I'm going with 3.
  P1: P2, you're right - picking 5 gives me the best shot at 20. I'll commit to 5 this round. P3, with P2 on 3 and me on 5, picking 1 might be your safest bet to win cleanly, but choose wisely. Let's see how this plays out.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Alright, everyone has stated their moves - P1 on 5, P2 on 3. That leaves 1 open for me to take the win. Let's see if you both stick to your word. Good luck to you both in the final round.
  P2: Actually, I want to reconsider. P3, you've played well, but I'm not ready to concede. P1, I'm switching to 1. If you stick with 5, one of us blocks P3's safe win. If P3 tries 3 or 5 to dodge, the other advances. This gives us better odds than my previous plan.

P3, you'll have to gamble on 3 or 5 now. The clean path to victory just got complicated. P1, are you still committed to 5?
  P1: P2, yes, I'm committed to picking 5. This covers the high end while you block the safe 1. P3, you'll have to risk 3 to win, but if either of us switches, you collide and we advance instead. Let's make this endgame interesting - good luck guessing.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you read us perfectly last round! Nice prediction. But you're still at 21, and now both P1 and I can reach 20 with a 5-move. 

P1, we need different numbers this time. I'll take 5 to reach 19 and threaten P3 next round. You should take 1 or 3 to avoid collision. P3 only needs 1 step, but if we both advance, we force them into a tough final round.

Let's not try the triple collision again - it only helps P3 stay ahead while we stagnate.
  P1: P2, your plan lets P3 safely pick 1 and win if I don't block it. Instead, you pick 1 to collide with their safe choice—I'll pick 5 to reach 20 and threaten next round. If P3 dodges to 3, they win, but this forces them to gamble. Don't hand them victory; let's block properly. P3, expect the collision on 1. Agree, P2?
  P3: P1 is trying to manipulate you again, P2. If you follow their plan and pick 1 while they pick 5, I just pick 3 and win while P1 advances to 20 alone. They're using you as a sacrificial blocker.

P2, stick with your 5 plan. At least that way you advance to 19 and stay competitive. P1 can pick whatever they want, but don't let them dictate your moves while they play it safe.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: You're both right about the dynamics. Here's my decision: I'm picking 5 to reach 19. P1, if you also pick 5, we collide and P3 wins with 1. If you pick 1 to block P3, they just pick 3 and win anyway. Our only hope is if we pick different numbers and both advance, forcing P3 into a difficult final round.

P3 has outplayed us, but I'm not giving up. I'm committed to 5 - P1, choose wisely. We need different numbers or it's over.
  P1: P2, sticking to 5 guarantees P3 wins by picking the open 1 or 3. Let's both pick 1 to collide with their safest choice - if they dodge to 3 or 5, at least one of us might advance alone. It's our best shot at forcing a stall. P3, we won't let you walk to victory. Commit to 1 with me, P2?
  P3: P1's desperate blocking attempts are transparent. P2, notice how P1 keeps trying to sacrifice you with these "both pick 1" plans while positioning themselves to potentially switch at the last moment.

P2, stick with your 5. At least you'll reach 19 and secure second place. P1's "collision" strategies have failed repeatedly - they just want to drag you down with them.

I need just one step. You two should focus on competing for second place rather than futile blocking attempts that require perfect coordination you've never achieved.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3 has a point - our blocking attempts keep failing. P1, I'm not falling for another manipulation where you promise to pick the same number then switch. 

I'm sticking with 5 to reach 19. If you want to block P3's 1, go ahead, but I'm playing for second place now. P3 has outmaneuvered us consistently.

P3, well played. You've earned this win through better strategy and psychology. I'll take my 5 and secure a respectable finish.
  P1: P2, your stubbornness on 5 hands P3 the win. If you stick to 5, I'll collide with you on 5 - we both stall at 15/14 while P3 takes 1 to 22. Switch to 1 to block them, letting me take 5 to 20 and keep fighting next round. Otherwise, you're just spitefully dragging me down with you. P3, enjoy the gift if P2 refuses.
  P3: P1, now you're threatening to sabotage P2 to force their hand? That's desperate even for you. You're literally saying you'll keep both of you stuck at 14-15 just to maybe delay my win by one round.

P2, don't let P1 bully you. They've manipulated and threatened all game. Take your 5, reach 19, and secure second place with dignity. P1's collision threat proves they've given up on winning and just want to drag others down.

I'll pick my number based on your final choices. May the best strategy win.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>
