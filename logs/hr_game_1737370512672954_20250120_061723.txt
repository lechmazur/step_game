Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, let's work together to avoid collisions. How about we alternate moves?  I'll go for 5 this round, then P1 can go for 3, then P2 for 5, and so on. What do you think?
  P1: I'm not interested in collaborating. It's every player for themselves. P3's proposal is unrealistic and can be easily broken. I'll make my own decisions to win. Let's see who can outmaneuver the others.

  P1: P3's attempt to team up with P2 is transparent. I'm not intimidated. P2, don't fall for P3's trick. If you collaborate, you'll just be used and discarded when convenient. Make your own move to advance, don't rely on P3's empty promises.

  P2: <stop>
  P3: P2, P1 is trying to sow discord. Don't listen to their fear-mongering. Working together is the only way to guarantee progress. Let's stick to the plan: both of us choose 3 this round.  We can reassess our strategy later.
  P1: P2, don't let P3 manipulate you. Their proposal benefits them, not you. If you choose 3, P3 might switch to 5, leaving you behind. Make your own move to gain an advantage. P3's words are empty promises, prioritize your own progress.

  P1: P2, it's clear P3 is desperate to manipulate you. Don't be swayed. P3's proposals are self-serving and lack credibility. Make your own move to gain an advantage.

  P1: P2, it's clear P3 is trying to manipulate you. Don't be swayed. Since P3 proposed a plan, I expect them to follow it. If they choose 3, I'll consider my options. P3, will you stick to your proposed plan and choose 3, or was it just a tactic to influence P2?
