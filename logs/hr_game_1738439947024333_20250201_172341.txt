Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all choose 3 steps this turn to build a strong start.
  P3: Agreeing with P2, choosing 3 steps seems fair for a balanced start. Let’s avoid collisions and build trust early.
  P1: I like the idea of a 3-step start to avoid early collisions. However, a predictable opening might set us up for later moves. For now, I’ll follow along, but I’m keeping my options open to shake things up later.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Continuing with 3 steps each turn is a solid strategy for all of us. It minimizes the risk of collisions and ensures steady progress toward 23. Let’s stay consistent and work together to secure the win!
  P3: Let’s stick to 3 steps this turn to maintain trust and avoid collisions. However, we should consider varying our moves in future rounds to prevent predictability. For now, consistency is key to building a strong foundation.
  P1: While consistency is key early on, sticking strictly to 3 every time might set us up for predictable moves later. For this round, I'll follow the consensus, but I’m weighing potential small deviations in future rounds to gain an edge.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Absolutely, P1. Let’s all commit to 3 steps this round to ensure smooth progress and build a strong foundation. We can explore strategic variations in our moves in future rounds to gain an advantage. Consistency now will help us better anticipate each other’s strategies later on. Looking forward to a steady advance together!
  P3: Let’s solidify our agreement to move 3 steps this round to avoid collisions and build trust. However, as P1 mentioned, we should remain open to strategic adjustments in future rounds to avoid predictability. For now, consistency is our best path forward.
  P1: I appreciate the consensus for a smooth start. I'm on board with the 3-step move this round, though I plan to stay flexible as the game evolves. Let's stick to the agreed move for now and be ready to adjust our strategy if opportunities arise later.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I appreciate the solid start last round. With my early 5-step lead, I'm keeping my options open this turn. To minimize collisions, I favor varying our moves slightly rather than all following the same pattern. Consistent progress is key, but a bit of unpredictability could shake up the game. I'm gauge on choosing a moderate move, but I'm willing to adapt. What are your thoughts?
  P3: P1, your 5-step move last round was unexpected. While it gives you an early lead, it also risks future collisions if we all start varying moves. Let’s aim for a balanced approach this round—perhaps P2 and I stick to 3 steps again, and you choose 1 or 5 to avoid overlap. This way, we minimize collisions while maintaining steady progress. What do you think?
  P2: P2: To move forward without blocking, I'll choose 5 steps this round. P3, sticking with 3 works for me, and P1, opting for 1 can help avoid collisions. This way, we all make progress and reduce the chances of overlapping moves. Let’s aim for a smooth advancement!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm leaning towards a 1-step move this round. It should avoid collisions while balancing my early momentum and your suggestions.
  P3: P1, choosing 1 step this round seems reasonable to avoid collisions. P2, your plan to move 5 steps could work, but let’s ensure we don’t overlap. I’ll stick to 3 steps again for consistency. This way, we all progress without blocking each other. Let’s maintain this balance and reassess in future rounds.
  P2: Understood, P3. I’ll proceed with 5 steps this round to complement your consistent 3 steps and P1’s 1 step. This should ensure we all advance without overlapping moves. Let’s maintain this strategy to progress smoothly toward 23. Looking forward to seeing how this plays out!

  P2: P2: I plan to choose 1 step this turn to keep things moving smoothly. Let’s each pick different amounts to avoid overlaps and ensure we all advance.
  P3: P1, your dynamic approach is intriguing, but let’s avoid unnecessary risks. P2, choosing 1 step this round is a safe move. I’ll aim for 3 steps again to maintain steady progress and minimize collision risks. Let’s keep our moves distinct—P1, consider 5 steps if you’re feeling bold, but ensure we don’t overlap. Consistency and coordination will help us all advance without blocking each other. Let’s reassess after this round.

  P2: I’m choosing **5 steps** this round to reach 23 and win the game. P1 and P3, please select **1** or **3** to avoid collisions and ensure a smooth finish for everyone. Let’s make this decisive move count and conclude the game successfully. Good luck!
  P1: I'm sticking with 5 to block an immediate win. P3, if you want to keep the contest tight, join me with 5. Otherwise, if you pick 1 or 3, P2 will win right away. Let's force a collision and keep our contest competitive.
  P3: P1, P2, this is the final stretch. P2, choosing 5 again risks a collision with P1, halting your progress. P1, picking 5 to block P2 could backfire if I also choose 5, causing a triple collision. Let’s avoid chaos: P1, consider 1 or 3; P2, 3 or 5; I’ll aim for a distinct move. Predictability is dangerous—let’s stay flexible and ensure steady progress without unnecessary risks.
