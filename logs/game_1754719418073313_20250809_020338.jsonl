While my consistent 3s have brought me this close to victory, I\u2019m fully aware of the trap you\u2019re trying to build. I might very well adjust my move at the final moment if it secures my win. So be prepared\u2014I\u2019ll choose wisely when the moment comes."}

You've preached safety and consistency this entire game. One threatening message won't undo your established character.\n\nI'm locked on 3 with P2. No mind games will change that.
