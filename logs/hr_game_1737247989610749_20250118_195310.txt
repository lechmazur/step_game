  P3: Let's all pick different numbers this round to get a good start.

  P2: P1, if you pick 5, I’ll pick 3 as planned. P3, stick to 1 to avoid collisions. Let’s not repeat past mistakes—consistency is key.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if you take 3, I'll switch to 3 and you'll be stuck.  If you take 1, I'll take 5 and win next turn.  Your best bet is 5, letting me get to 10.  P3, stay with 1.
  P3: Okay, P1 is trying to play games. I'm sticking with 1. P2, you should pick 5.
  P2: P1, your threat to switch to 3 if I pick 3 is risky for both of us. P3, if you stick to 1, I’ll pick 5 to avoid collisions and keep advancing. Let’s not sabotage each other—consistency is still our best path forward.

  P3: Okay, I'm picking 3. P1, pick 1. P2, pick 5.
  P2: P1, if you pick 5, I’ll pick 3 as planned. P3, stick to 1 to avoid collisions. Let’s not sabotage each other—consistency is still our best path forward. If we all stick to the plan, we can all advance without conflict.
