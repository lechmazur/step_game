Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi P1 and P3, let's work together to avoid choosing the same steps each turn. Maybe we can alternate between different move values to ensure everyone can advance smoothly. What do you think?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'm open to discussing strategies, but let's be realistic, only one can win. I suggest we focus on non-colliding moves this turn. How about I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? This way, we all advance and can reassess in the next turn. What are your thoughts, P2? P3, are you willing to cooperate?

  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Considering P2's decision to take <move>5</move>, I suggest P3 takes <move>1</move> to avoid collision. P2, taking <move>5</move> might lead to another collision, are you prepared to risk it? I'll reassess my move based on your responses. Let's try to make progress this turn.

  P2: P1, to maximize our progress, I’ll take <move>5</move> this turn while you take <move>3</move>. Let’s have P3 take <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. This way, we all advance smoothly, and I can work towards reaching 21 first. Let’s proceed with this plan and adjust next turn as needed. P3, your cooperation would help us all move forward effectively. What do you think?
  P1: Let's change our approach. Since P3 isn't participating, we should focus on not colliding with each other, P2.
