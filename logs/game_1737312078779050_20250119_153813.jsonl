Here's my strategy:\n\n1. **Coordinate Step Choices:** Since collisions occur when multiple players choose the same number, coordinating our choices ensures that each player advances every turn. This minimizes the risk of stagnation due to collisions.\n\n2. **Rotate Step Numbers:** Proposing a rotation system where each player takes different step numbers each turn promotes fairness and prevents any single player from consistently taking smaller steps.\n\n3. **Maximize Progress:** While coordinating, prioritize choosing higher step numbers to maximize individual progress towards the 21-step goal.\n\n4. **Adapt to Deviations:** Be prepared to adjust strategy if another player deviates from the agreed plan. This might involve being vigilant in future turns and possibly choosing less optimal step numbers to avoid collisions.\n\n5. **Communicate Clearly:** Ensure that all players are on the same page by reiterating the plan and seeking confirmation before proceeding to the move phase.\n\nBy following these steps, I aim to efficiently progress towards the victory condition while minimizing risks associated with collisions."}
