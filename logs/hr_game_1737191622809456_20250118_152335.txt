Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you take 3, we both lose.  If you take 1, I'll take 5 and we can discuss future moves.  If you take 5, I'll take 3.  P1, if P2 takes 1, take 3.  If P2 takes 5, you take 1.  If P2 takes 3, you take 1.

  P2: P1 and P3, if you both choose 5, neither of you will move.  I'm taking 3.  If you're smart, you'll choose 1 and 5 respectively.
  P1: Understood, P2. I'll take 1 and P3 takes 5 this round to avoid collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, take 1. P1, take 3.  I'll take 5. Let's all make progress.  If you deviate, I will prioritize blocking you in future rounds.

  P1: Understood, I'll take 1 step and P3 takes 5 this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P2, I'm taking 5.  P1, you take 1.  If P2 takes 3, he stays at 4 and I win next turn. If P2 takes 5, I'll still win next turn. If P2 takes 1, you win next turn P1.  This is the only logical outcome.
