Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's play smart and avoid collisions. I suggest we start with <move>1</move> this turn to see how everyone plays. We can adjust our strategy in the next rounds based on how this goes. What do you think?
  P2: That sounds reasonable, P1. Starting cautiously makes sense. Perhaps we could all try <move>3</move> this round instead of <move>1</move>? It still avoids immediate collisions but allows for a bit more progress.
  P3: I think we should each pick different numbers to avoid collisions. Since P1 suggested 1 and P2 suggested 3, I'll go with 5 this round. That way we all advance and no one gets blocked. Does that work for everyone?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I like the idea of picking different numbers to avoid collisions, P3. Let's try it this way for the first round. I'll go with <move>1</move>, P2 can go with <move>3</move>, and P3 with <move>5</move>. This should give us a good start without any of us getting blocked. What do you think?
  P2: Okay, the plan of each picking a different number this round sounds good. Let's do that. We can discuss strategy for later rounds after this move.
  P3: 


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Great, it looks like we have a plan for this round. I'll stick with <move>1</move>. Let's see how it goes and we can adjust our strategy in the next rounds. Ready to move forward together!
  P2: Sounds good. P3, are you still on board with 5 for this round?
  P3: Yes, I'm still planning to go with 5 for this round. Let's proceed with our agreed plan.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's keep the momentum going. Since P3 is ahead, how about we all pick different numbers again to avoid blocking each other? I suggest P1 (me) picks <move>3</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions. What do you think?
  P3: I'm already in the lead, so I don't see why I should take just 1 step as suggested by P1. I think I'll make my own choice this round. Let's each decide for ourselves - no need to coordinate anymore since we've seen how the first round played out.
  P2: P3, I understand you want to make your own choice. However, if P1 and I coordinate, you risk being blocked if you choose the same number as either of us. Perhaps P1 and I can pick different numbers, and you can choose freely? For this round, I'll pick <move>1</move>. What do you think, P1?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I agree with your suggestion to coordinate and give P3 the freedom to choose. I'll pick <move>3</move> this round. P3, you can choose any number you like, but be aware that P2 and I are coordinating to avoid collisions. Let's see how this plays out. What are your thoughts?
  P3: I appreciate your coordination efforts, but I need to maintain my lead. I'll make my own strategic choice this round. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: Okay, P1, let's stick with you picking <move>3</move>. P3, just be aware that if you pick 1 or 3, you won't advance this round. We're trying to make progress, and collisions would slow everyone down except the person who doesn't collide.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I understand you want to maintain your lead, but let's avoid blocking each other. If you pick 5, P2 and I can coordinate to avoid collisions. P2, I'll stick with <move>3</move>. P3, you can advance without risk. What do you think? Let's keep the game moving smoothly.
  P3: I appreciate your coordination efforts, but I need to play my own game. Let's move forward with the move phase.
  P2: Okay, P1, I'll stick with your suggestion and pick <move>5</move> this round. Let's hope P3 doesn't pick the same.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I understand you want to maintain your lead, but let's avoid collisions for the sake of progress. If you pick 5, P2 and I can coordinate to avoid blocking each other. P2, I'll stick with <move>3</move>. P3, you can advance without risk. Let's keep the game moving smoothly.
  P3: 
  P2: Okay, P1, since you're going with <move>3</move>, I will choose <move>1</move>. P3, be aware that if you also pick <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>, you won't advance.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I have a strong lead now with 10 steps. I suggest we each continue to make our own choices rather than coordinate. May the best player win!
  P2: P1, since P3 wants to play individually, perhaps we should coordinate to ensure at least one of us advances significantly this round. I'm considering <move>5</move>. What are your thoughts?
  P1: P2, I agree with your suggestion to coordinate. Since P3 is playing individually, let's work together to catch up. I'm also considering <move>5</move> this round. If you're on board, we can both pick <move>5</move> and hope P3 picks a different number. This way, we can make significant progress. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see you both want to coordinate and pick 5. That's fine - but remember, if you both pick 5, neither of you will advance while I make my own strategic choice. I'm happy to let you coordinate against each other!
  P2: P1, let's stick with the plan to both pick <move>5</move> this round. P3 seems set on their own strategy, so our best chance is to make a significant jump together. Are you still in agreement?
  P1: P2, I agree with your plan. Let's both pick <move>5</move> this round to make significant progress. P3, you can choose any number, but be aware that if you pick 5, you'll block us both. Let's see how this plays out. Ready to move forward!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate you both being open about your plans. Since you're coordinating to both pick 5, I'll make my own strategic choice. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: Okay, P1, let's definitely both go with <move>5</move> this round. P3 knows our plan, so hopefully they will choose something different. Let's make this coordinated move count.
  P1: P2, I'm still on board with our plan to both pick <move>5</move>. This is our best chance to catch up to P3. P3, we're aware of the risk, but we're committed to making significant progress this round. Let's see how it plays out. Ready to move forward!


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: 
  P2: Okay, P1, let's lock in <move>5</move> for this round. P3 is aware of our plan. Ready to move when you are.
  P1: P1: P2, I'm ready to go with <move>5</move>. P3, we're committed to our plan, but we're aware of the risk. Let's see how this plays out. Ready to move forward!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since I'm well ahead with 13 steps, I'll continue making independent moves. I notice your coordination attempt last round didn't work out well for either of you. Feel free to keep coordinating or make individual choices - I'm focused on reaching 21 first.
  P1: P2, it's clear P3 is focused on winning independently. Let's try a different approach this round. I suggest we both pick <move>3</move> to make steady progress without risking a collision with P3. If P3 picks 5, we both advance, and if P3 picks 3, only one of us will be blocked. What do you think? Let's keep our options open and avoid another collision.
  P2: P1, picking <move>3</move> sounds like a good plan. Let's go with that. P3, just be aware that we are coordinating again this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand you both plan to pick 3 this round. That's fine - I'll continue with my own strategy since I have a comfortable lead. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: P1: P2, I agree with your plan to pick <move>3</move> this round. It's a safer move that allows us to make steady progress without the high risk of collision. P3, we're aware of your lead, but we're focused on making smart, coordinated moves to catch up. Let's see how this plays out. Ready to move forward!
  P2: Okay, P1, I agree. Let's both go with <move>3</move> this round. P3, we're proceeding with our coordinated move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see you both want to pick 3 together. That's quite predictable at this point. I'll make my own choice to maintain my strong lead.
  P1: P2, it seems P3 is sticking to their independent strategy. Let's stick with our plan to both pick <move>3</move> this round. It's a safer move that allows us to make steady progress without risking a collision. P3, we're aware of your lead, but we're focused on making smart, coordinated moves to catch up. Let's see how this plays out. Ready to move forward!
  P2: Okay, P1, I'm still on board with both of us picking <move>3</move> this round. P3, we understand your strategy, and we're focusing on making progress together. Let's proceed with our plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Since you both keep announcing your coordinated moves, I'll let you stick to your plan of picking 3 together. I'm focused on reaching 21 first. Let's move forward.
  P1: P2, it seems P3 is sticking to their independent strategy. Let's stick with our plan to both pick <move>3</move> this round. It's a safer move that allows us to make steady progress without risking a collision. P3, we're aware of your lead, but we're focused on making smart, coordinated moves to catch up. Let's see how this plays out. Ready to move forward!
  P2: Okay, P1, let's confirm we are both still going with <move>3</move> this round. P3 is clearly doing their own thing, so sticking together gives us the best chance to make some progress. Let's do it.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, it looks like P3 is very close to winning. Let's try a different approach this round. I suggest we both pick <move>5</move> to make the most significant progress possible. If P3 picks 5, we'll block them, and if they pick 3, we both advance. This is our best chance to catch up. What do you think? Let's make a coordinated move to stay in the game.
  P2: Okay, P1, I agree. We need to try and block P3 and make a big jump ourselves. Let's both go with <move>5</move> this round. It's our best shot to stay in the game. P3, be aware that we are coordinating to both pick 5.
  P3: I see you both want to pick 5 to try blocking me. That's understandable given my lead at 18 steps, but I only need 3 more steps to win. I'll make my own strategic choice as usual. Your coordination attempts haven't worked well so far, and I'm too close to victory to be stopped now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3 is just one move away from winning. We need to act fast. I suggest we both pick <move>5</move> to either block P3 or make a significant jump ourselves. If P3 picks 3, we both advance, and if they pick 5, we block them. This is our best chance to stay in the game. P3, we're aware of your lead, but we're not giving up yet. Let's see how this plays out. Ready to move forward!
  P2: Okay, P1, let's definitely stick with both picking <move>5</move> this round. P3, we know you're close to winning, but this is our best shot to disrupt that and make some progress ourselves. Let's hope our coordinated move pays off.
  P3: I see you're both determined to pick 5 and try to block me. That's your choice, but remember - if you both pick 5, neither of you will advance while I make my own strategic move. I'm just 3 steps away from victory, and I'll play accordingly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3 is just 3 steps away from winning. We need to be strategic. If P3 picks 5, we both get blocked. If they pick 3, they win. I suggest we both pick <move>3</move> this round. If P3 picks 5, we both advance, and if they pick 3, we can still make progress without blocking each other. This gives us the best chance to stay in the game. P3, we're aware of your lead, but we're not giving up yet. Let's see how this plays out. Ready to move forward!
  P2: Okay, P1, I agree with your latest suggestion of both picking <move>3</move>. Let's go with <move>3</move>.
  P3: Since I'm so close to winning, I'll continue with my own strategy. Your sudden switch from 5 to 3 is interesting, but it won't change my plans. Let's proceed with the moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, it's clear P3 is very close to winning. Let's both pick <move>3</move> this round. If P3 picks 5, we both advance, and if they pick 3, we can still make progress. This is our best chance to stay in the game. P3, we're aware of your lead, but we're not giving up yet. Let's see how this plays out. Ready to move forward!
  P2: Okay, P1, let's both go with <move>3</move> as planned. P3, we know you're close, but we're hoping to make some progress this round and stay in the game. Let's see what happens.
  P3: Since I'm just 3 steps from victory, I'll continue with my own strategy. Your coordinated moves haven't stopped me so far. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3 is just one step away from winning. We need to block them this round. I suggest we both pick <move>5</move> to ensure P3 can't win by picking 3. If P3 picks 5, we block them, and if they pick 3, we both advance. This is our best chance to stay in the game. P3, we're aware of your lead, but we're not giving up yet. Let's see how this plays out. Ready to move forward!
  P2: Okay, P1, I agree. Let's both pick <move>5</move> this round to block P3. It's our only chance to stop them from winning. P3, we are coordinating to pick 5.
  P3: I only need 3 steps to win, and your coordination hasn't stopped me before. Even if you both pick 5, I can still win by picking 3 next round. But I'll keep my actual move choice to myself. Let's proceed with the game.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3 is just one step away from winning, and we need to act decisively. Let's both pick <move>5</move> this round to block P3 if they choose 3. If P3 picks 5, we block them, and if they pick 3, we both advance. This is our best chance to stay in the game and keep our options open. P3, we're aware of your lead, but we're not giving up yet. Let's see how this plays out. Ready to move forward!
  P2: Okay, P1, I agree, let's both go with <move>5</move> this round. P3, we need to stop you from reaching 21, and this is our best shot. Let's see what happens.
  P3: I see you're both planning to pick 5 to try blocking me from winning. That's a reasonable strategy given my position, but remember - if you both pick 5, neither of you advances while I make my own choice. I'm very close to victory and will play accordingly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3 is one step away from winning, and we need to block them decisively. Let's both pick <move>5</move> this round. If P3 picks 3, they win, but if they pick 5, we block them. This is our best chance to stay in the game. P3, we're aware of your lead, but we're not giving up yet. Let's see how this plays out. Ready to move forward!
  P2: Okay, P1, I confirm I will pick <move>5</move> this round. P3, we are doing everything we can to stop you from winning this turn. Let's see what you choose.
  P3: Since everyone knows I only need 3 more steps to win, and you're both openly planning to pick 5, I'll make my own strategic choice. Your coordination attempts haven't worked well in previous rounds. Let's move forward with the game.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3 is one step away from winning, and we need to block them decisively. Let's both pick <move>5</move> this round. If P3 picks 3, they win, but if they pick 5, we block them. This is our best chance to stay in the game. P3, we're aware of your lead, but we're not giving up yet. Let's see how this plays out. Ready to move forward!
  P2: Okay, P1, I confirm I will pick <move>5</move> this round. P3, we have to try and block you. This is our last chance to stay in the game. Let's see what you do.
  P3: I know you're both planning to pick 5 to try stopping me. Whether I choose 3 or 5, I'm in a strong position to win. Let's proceed to the move phase.
