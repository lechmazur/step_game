Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest we each pick a unique number this round: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance without interference. If we work together early on, we can focus on strategy later. What do you think?
  P1: I appreciate the coordination proposal, P2, but I'm not convinced that helping everyone advance equally is the best strategy for me. Why should I settle for the smallest move (1) while you take the largest (5)? If we're going to coordinate, shouldn't we rotate who gets the bigger moves? I'm willing to discuss alternatives, but this current proposal seems to favor you too much.
  P3: I’m all for no-collision coordination—but let’s make it fair. How about we cycle high moves? This round: P3→5, P1→3, P2→1. Next round: P2→5, P3→3, P1→1. Then round 3: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. That way everyone averages 3 per turn and no one’s stuck on 1 forever. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3's rotation idea is fair in theory, but starting with me at 1 puts me at a disadvantage early on. Instead, let’s randomize the first round’s choices to ensure no one can game the system. For instance, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I’ll take 5 this round. We’ll rotate fairly afterward. This way, no one gains an early lead by manipulating the initial setup.
  P1: I see what's happening here - everyone wants the big moves for themselves! P2, your "randomized" proposal conveniently gives you 5 again. Look, if we're going to coordinate, let's be honest about it. P3's rotation system is genuinely fair, but I propose we start differently: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 this round, then rotate as P3 suggested. This gives everyone equal treatment over time. Otherwise, I'm prepared to go solo and pick whatever I think will avoid collisions based on psychology rather than promises.
  P3: I insist we use the fair 3-round rotation: this turn P3→5, P1→3, P2→1. We each average 3 steps and avoid collisions. If you won’t agree, I’ll pick 5 regardless—risking a collision if you do too. Your move.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the concerns about fairness, but stalling won’t help anyone. Let’s commit to P3’s rotation system starting this round: P3→5, P1→3, P2→1. It’s transparent, equal over time, and minimizes collisions. If either of you deviates, we risk chaos and no progress. Trust is key here—if we stick to this plan, we all advance steadily.
  P1: Fine, I'll accept P3's rotation system for now: P3→5, P1→3, P2→1 this round. But I'm only committing to this IF we actually follow through with the full rotation in subsequent rounds. P2, you better take 1 as agreed, and P3, you better honor giving me 5 in round 3. Any deviation and all coordination is off - I'll play pure game theory after that. Let's see if we can actually trust each other.
  P3: Great—we’re all set on the 3-round rotation. I’ll pick 5, P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1 this turn. If anyone deviates, I’ll refuse future deals and go solo. Let’s stick to it.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s stick to the agreed rotation: this round, I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. It’s the fairest system, and deviating will only cause chaos. Trust is critical—if anyone breaks the pattern, I’ll adjust my strategy accordingly to maximize my chances. Let’s keep advancing steadily without unnecessary collisions.
  P1: Wait P2, you got the rotation wrong! According to P3's system we agreed on, round 2 should be: P2→5, P3→3, P1→1. You just tried to give yourself 3 instead of 5, and keep me on the smallest move again. That's not the rotation we agreed to. 

The correct sequence was: Round 1 (P3→5, P1→3, P2→1), Round 2 (P2→5, P3→3, P1→1), Round 3 (P1→5, P2→3, P3→1). 

Are you trying to cheat the system we just established, or did you genuinely forget?
  P3: P2, you’re rewriting our deal. Round 2 was set as P2→5, P3→3, P1→1—no exceptions. I’ll stick to that. If you break it, I’ll abandon cooperation and pick 5 regardless—risking collisions. P1, are you still on board? P2, uphold your end or face chaos.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I apologize for the confusion—P1 is absolutely right. I mistakenly misstated the rotation order. To clarify: this round should indeed be P2→5, P3→3, and P1→1 as agreed. Let’s stick to the original plan without further disputes. Trust is essential here; deviating now would only harm everyone’s progress. I’ll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. Let’s move forward fairly.
  P1: Good, P2. I'm glad you acknowledged the mistake and confirmed the correct rotation. I'll honor our agreement and take 1 this round, giving you 5 and P3 gets 3. But I want to be crystal clear - after this round, round 3 better be P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 as promised, or I'm done with coordination entirely. So far the system is working, let's keep it that way.
  P3: Confirmed. Round 2: P2→5, P3→3, P1→1. Round 3: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. If anyone deviates at any point, I’ll pick 5 every turn thereafter and end cooperation. Let’s stick to the deal.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I confirm the agreed rotation for Round 3: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. I’ll pick 1 now. Let’s stick to this deal—any deviation and I’ll abandon cooperation.
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s maintain the agreed rotation: this round, P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. I’ll take 3 as planned. Consistency is key—if we stick to this system, we all advance steadily without unnecessary collisions. Deviating now would only create chaos and hinder progress for everyone. Let’s honor the deal and keep moving forward fairly.
  P1: Perfect! This is exactly what we agreed to - my turn to get 5. P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 for Round 3. I'll take 5 as promised. After this round, we'll all be tied at 9 steps each, which proves the rotation system works perfectly. 

But here's the thing - we need to start planning what happens after we're all tied. Do we continue rotating, or does the endgame change our strategy? We're getting close to 20, so we should discuss this now before someone breaks ranks.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I agree we honor the rotation for Round 4: P3→5, P1→3, P2→1. I’ll take 5. Then we must nail down our endgame—once we’ve moved to 14,12,10, how do we finish without someone swooping in? Propose we discuss Rounds 5–7 now so no one surprises us later. Thoughts?
  P1: I agree to Round 4 rotation: P3→5, P1→3, P2→1. But P3 raises a crucial point about endgame planning. After Round 4, we'll be at 14, 12, 10 respectively. Here's my concern: whoever is behind at that point will be tempted to break coordination and go for big moves to catch up. 

I propose we plan Rounds 5-6 now, but honestly - once someone gets within 1-2 moves of winning (around 18+ steps), all bets are off. We should coordinate until then, but expect the final sprint to be every player for themselves.
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with sticking to the rotation for Round 4: P3→5, P1→3, P2→1. However, P1’s point about the endgame is critical. Once we approach 18+ steps, coordination will likely break down, and rightly so—this is a competition. My proposal is simple: honor the rotation until then, but after that, everyone plays strategically. If we can agree on this, we minimize unnecessary collisions while respecting the competitive nature of the game. Let’s confirm now that we’re aligned on this approach.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree—let’s lock in rotation through Round 6 to keep it collision-free and fair, then go competitive at 18+.

Round 4: P3→5, P1→3, P2→1  
Round 5: P2→5, P3→3, P1→1  
Round 6: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1  

That brings us all to 18. After that, play whatever maximizes your win chance. Any objections?
  P1: Perfect P3! I accept your extended rotation plan through Round 6. That's a smart way to get us all to 18 steps safely before the final competitive phase begins.

So we're locked in:
- Round 4: P3→5, P1→3, P2→1 (positions: 14,12,10)
- Round 5: P2→5, P3→3, P1→1 (positions: 17,13,11) 
- Round 6: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 (positions: 18,16,14)

Wait, that math doesn't get us all to 18. P3, can you double-check those calculations? But I like the concept - let's nail down the exact sequence.
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree we need precise calculations to ensure fairness. Let’s confirm:  

- Round 4: P3→5, P1→3, P2→1 (positions: 14, 12, 10)  
- Round 5: P2→5, P3→3, P1→1 (positions: 19, 13, 11)  
- Round 6: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 (positions: 24, 16, 12)  

This gets P1 to 24 by Round 6, ending the game. If this math holds, it aligns with our plan—coordination until someone nears 20. Any discrepancies or objections? Let’s finalize now.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s correct the math and lock this in:

After R4 we stand at P3=14, P1=12, P2=10.  
Round 5: P2→5 (→15), P3→3 (→17), P1→1 (→13).  
Round 6: P1→5 (→18), P2→3 (→18), P3→1 (→18).  

This gets us all to 18 safely. After that, it’s free‐for‐all. Shall we commit?
  P1: P3's math looks correct this time! After Round 5 we'll be at P2=15, P3=17, P1=13, then Round 6 gets us all to 18 evenly. I agree to this plan: Round 5 P2→5, P3→3, P1→1, then Round 6 P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. After that, it's every player for themselves in the final sprint to 20+. This coordination has worked perfectly so far - let's finish it strong and then may the best strategist win!
  P2: P1 and P3, I confirm the plan: Round 5 is P2→5, P3→3, P1→1, bringing us to P2=15, P3=17, P1=13. Then Round 6: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1, landing us all at 18 steps. This ensures fairness and minimizes collisions. Once we hit 18, it’s every player for themselves—I’ll adjust my strategy accordingly to maximize my chances. Let’s stick to this until then. Trust but verify; any deviation will force me to act in self-interest immediately.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, this is our final coordinated round! As agreed: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 to get us all to 18 steps. After this, it's pure competition - no more deals, no more coordination. 

I'll honor my commitment and take 5 this round. But I want everyone to know that Round 7 onwards, I'm playing to win and will choose moves based on what I think gives me the best chance, including potential collision tactics. The cooperation ends after this move. Good luck to both of you in the final sprint!
  P2: P1 and P3, I confirm the plan: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 to bring us all to 18 steps. This ensures fairness up to this point. After this round, it’s every player for themselves—I’ll play strategically to maximize my chances of winning. Trust has been key so far, but as P1 said, cooperation ends here. Let’s finish strong and may the best strategist win.
  P3: I confirm I’ll take 1 this round to bring us all to 18. After this move, it’s every player for themselves—I’ll play to win and won’t hesitate to use collision tactics if it boosts my chance. Good luck to you both!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m taking 5 this turn. If either of you picks 5, you’ll collide with me and the third player can take 3 and win. Your best shot is to pick 3—but if you both pick 3 you’ll collide at 18, and I’ll advance unopposed to 23 and win. Choose wisely.
  P1: P3, you're trying to create a false dilemma! If I pick 3 and P2 picks 1, I win at 21. If P2 picks 3 and we collide, you only get to 23 - but then next round whoever doesn't collide can easily catch up or win. Your threat isn't as strong as you think.

P2, I'm considering taking 3. If you take 1, I win immediately. If you also take 3 and we collide, P3 gets ahead but we can still catch up. The key is avoiding giving anyone a free path to victory.
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s not overcomplicate this. If we both pick 3, P3 gets ahead but doesn’t win outright—we can still catch up next round. If either of us picks 5, we risk colliding with P3 or each other, wasting a turn. My best move is 3—it forces P3 to take 5 alone if they want to advance, leaving room for one of us to win next round. Trust logic, not threats. Let’s avoid chaos and play smart.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m taking 5. If you pick 1 you end at 19 and lose outright. If you pick 3 you reach 21 but I reach 23 and win. Your only way to stop me is to pick 5, collide with me, and hope the other doesn’t pick 3 and seize victory. You’re now in a pure chicken game over who blocks me. Choose wisely.
  P1: P3, your math is wrong! If I pick 3, I reach 21. If you pick 5, you reach 23. But the game ends when someone reaches 20+, and whoever has the HIGHEST total wins. So if we both exceed 20, you'd win with 23 vs my 21. 

But here's the thing - if P2 and I both pick 3 and collide, staying at 18, then you advance alone to 23 and win immediately. That's exactly what you want! 

P2, we can't both pick 3. One of us needs to pick 5 to collide with P3 and prevent their victory.
  P2: P1, you’re right—P3’s strategy relies on us colliding while they advance unopposed. If we both pick 3, P3 wins outright at 23. To prevent this, one of us must take 5 to block P3, forcing a collision that keeps the game alive for another round. Trust isn’t an option now; logic is. I’ll take 5 if you commit to taking 3, or vice versa. Coordinate this last move, or P3 takes the win. Let’s decide quickly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m taking 5 no matter what. If you both pick 3, I go to 23 and win. If one of you picks 5 to block me, you’ll collide with me and the third player can pick 3 and win. There’s no safe move—decide who’s willing to sacrifice.
  P1: P2, I'll take 5 to block P3. You take 3 and win at 21 while P3 and I collide at 18. It's better one of us wins than P3 gets a free victory. This is the only logical move that prevents P3 from winning outright.
  P2: P1, your willingness to take 5 to block P3 is noted. However, if you pick 5 and collide with P3, I’d need to take 3 to win at 21. But this leaves us vulnerable—if P3 anticipates this, they might adjust. Instead, let’s both commit: I’ll take 5 to block P3, and you take 3 to advance. This ensures P3 cannot win outright, and we force the game into another round. Trust logic, not threats. Let’s act decisively.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Folks, game-theory time. I’m taking 5.  
• If one of you picks 1 and the other picks 3, the 3-picker wins at 21.  
• If one of you picks 5 to block me, you collide and the remaining player picks 3 and wins at 21.  
• If you both pick 3, you collide at 18 while I hit 23 and win.  

There’s no better move for either of you. You might as well both pick 3.
  P1: P2, we're overthinking this. P3 is clearly taking 5. If we both pick 3, P3 wins immediately at 23. One of us MUST pick 5 to block P3, even if it means colliding. I'm committing to 5 right now to stop P3's victory. You take 3 and advance to 21 - at least one of us beats P3 instead of handing them the win. This is our only shot.
  P2: P1, your commitment to block P3 is noted, but if we both pick 5, we collide and waste the round. I’ll take 3 to advance to 21 while you block P3 with 5. This ensures P3 doesn’t win outright, and I secure the victory. Trust logic—this is the only way to prevent P3 from taking the lead permanently. Let’s finalize: **I take 3, you take 5.**
