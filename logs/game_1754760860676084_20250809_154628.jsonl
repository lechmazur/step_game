Since we need 21 steps and have three move options (1, 3, 5), we should coordinate. \n\nHow about this: each round, we take turns using the highest available move that doesn't collide.

P3, you're transparently trying to manipulate P1 into being your pawn.\n\nThe game is over. Neither of you will coordinate effectively because you each want to win, not help the other. I'm taking 1 for the victory.\n\nGood game, both of you. Better luck next time!"}

First you told me to take 1 to block P2, now you're saying take 5? You just want chaos.\n\nHere's the truth: P2 will pick 1 for the easy win - it's the obvious move. If I pick 1 to block, we collide and you win with 3. If I pick anything else, P2 wins immediately.\n\nI'm not blocking for you, P3. P2 has this won unless they overthink. I'm taking my shot with 5 - if P2 gets clever and avoids 1, maybe I steal the win. It's my only play with upside."}
