Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hello everyone! In this game, coordination is key to avoid collisions. Since we all want to advance, maybe we should each pick different numbers this first round. How about we establish some kind of rotation system for fairness? What do you both think? I'm open to suggestions on how we can make this work smoothly.
  P3: I think a rotation system makes sense. Since we're all at 0 steps, we need to avoid collisions. How about I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5 for this first round? Then we can rotate in subsequent rounds. This way we all make progress at the beginning. Does that work for everyone?
  P1: Sounds good to me, P3. I'll pick 3 this round as you suggested. Let's rotate numbers each round to keep it fair and avoid collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with the rotation system. I'll take 5 this round as suggested. This ensures we all make progress without collisions. Let's stick with the rotation in future rounds: next time P3 takes 3, P1 takes 5, and I take 1. This keeps things fair and predictable.
  P3: 
  P1: P3, are you still on board with the rotation plan? Let us know so we can lock it in and move forward.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll continue with our rotation plan. As we agreed, I'll take 3 this round, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. The rotation is working well so far - let's stick with it. Is everyone still on board with this plan?
  P2: I appreciate everyone sticking to our rotation. However, I notice the gap between us is growing. If we continue with P3 taking 3, P1 taking 5, and me taking 1, P1 will pull ahead significantly. Perhaps we should adjust slightly - I could take 3 instead of 1 this round, P3 still takes 3, and P1 takes 1? This keeps the game more competitive. What do you both think?
  P1: I understand your concern, P2, but your proposed adjustment would cause an immediate collision between you and P3, preventing both of you from advancing. Let's stick to the original rotation plan this round. Next round, we can reassess to ensure fairness.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P1. P2's suggestion would cause a collision between us, which defeats the purpose of our rotation. Let's stick with the original plan for this round: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This keeps us all advancing. Yes, P1 will be ahead temporarily, but remember this is a marathon to 22 steps, not a sprint. We'll have plenty of time to adjust in future rounds if needed.
  P2: You're right, I made a mistake in my suggestion that would cause a collision. Let's stick with our original rotation for this round - I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. I see that after another rotation in Round 3, we'd all be at 9 steps anyway, so this plan is actually quite fair over time. I'm committed to our agreement.
  P1: Glad we're all aligned again. Let's stick to the rotation this turn as planned, and next round we'll evaluate if any adjustments are needed to keep things balanced.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm still committed to our rotation plan. After this round, P1 will be at 8, P2 at 6, and I'll be at 4. Then in round 3, we'll rotate again, and we'll end up at P1: 9, P2: 11, P3: 9. So it balances out over time. Let's stick with our plan: I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1 this round.
  P2: Thank you both for clarifying the balance of the rotation system. P3's math is correct - after Round 3, we'll all be at 9 steps, confirming the fairness of our approach. I'm fully on board with taking 1 this round as planned. I appreciate everyone's commitment to our agreement.
  P1: Great, glad we sorted that out clearly. Let's stick to the rotation as planned this round. Afterward, we can briefly confirm our moves for round 3 to avoid confusion next time.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: 
  P2: I think we've all reached a good understanding. I'm ready to move forward with the rotation plan as agreed - I'll take 1 this round. As P3 pointed out, after the next round we'll all be at 9 steps, confirming our system is fair. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P1: Looks like we're all set. Let's proceed as agreed, and good luck everyone!

  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's continue with our rotation as agreed. This round I'll take 3, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. As we calculated earlier, this will bring us all to 9 steps each after this round, confirming our rotation system is fair. After we're all equal at 9 steps, we should discuss our approach for Round 4. Does everyone still agree with the plan?
  P3: I agree with continuing our rotation. I'll take 5 this round, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This will indeed bring us all to 9 steps, making it perfectly fair. After this round, we should continue rotating in the same order for round 4: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps the game balanced while avoiding collisions. Is everyone still on board with this plan?
  P1: I agree—let's stick to the rotation as planned this round. Afterward, we can quickly confirm our approach for round 4 to maintain fairness and avoid confusion.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm fully on board with our rotation for this round. I'll take 3 as planned, which will bring us all to 9 steps afterward - perfectly balanced. I also agree with P3's suggestion for round 4, where I'd take 5, P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. This maintains our fair system while avoiding collisions. Thanks for everyone's cooperation - our plan is working smoothly.
  P3: I confirm I'm still following our rotation plan. I'll take 5 this round, bringing us all to 9 steps. For round 4, we'll continue rotating: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This system is working well to keep things fair while ensuring we all make progress. Let's stick with it.
  P1: I confirm my commitment for this round: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Our rotation is working well. Afterward, we'll all be even at 9 steps. Let's quickly reconfirm next round's rotation after we see the results.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm confident in our plan and ready to move forward. As we've all agreed, I'll take 3 this round, which will put us all at 9 steps afterward. Then for round 4, we'll continue with me taking 5, P3 taking 1, and P1 taking 3. Our rotation system is working perfectly.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our rotation. I'll take 5 this round as agreed, which will bring us all to 9 steps. For round 4, we'll continue rotating: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This system is working perfectly to keep things fair and ensure we all make progress.
  P1: Everything is clear and agreed upon. Let's finish this round as planned and then quickly confirm next round's moves afterward.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll continue with our rotation as agreed. This round I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. Our system has worked perfectly so far, bringing us all to 9 steps as planned. Let's maintain this rotation for the upcoming rounds as well. After this round, we'd rotate again: I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1 for round 5. Does everyone agree to continue with our established pattern?
  P2: I fully agree with continuing our rotation as established. I'll take 5 this round as planned, while P3 takes 1 and P1 takes 3. Our system has been working perfectly, keeping things fair and avoiding collisions. I'm also on board with the Round 5 rotation P3 mentioned. This methodical approach ensures we all advance efficiently. Let's maintain this successful strategy.
  P1: I agree to continue our established rotation. I'll take 3 this round as planned, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's keep it smooth and fair.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we're all on the same page with our rotation plan. I'll take 1 this round as agreed. After this round, the standings will be P1: 12, P2: 14, and me at 10. For round 5, I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. Our system is working perfectly to ensure everyone advances without collisions.
  P2: I'm fully committed to our rotation system - I'll take 5 this round as agreed. It's working perfectly to keep us advancing without collisions. After this round, I'll be at 14, P1 at 12, and P3 at 10. For round 5, we'll continue with me taking 1, P3 taking 3, and P1 taking 5. Let's keep this working smoothly all the way to the finish line.
  P1: Everything is clear and agreed upon. Let's finish this round as planned, then quickly reconfirm round 5 afterward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm still committed to our rotation plan. I'll take 1 this round as agreed. After this round, we'll continue with me taking 3, P1 taking 5, and P2 taking 1 for round 5. Our system has been working perfectly - we're all at 9 steps now and making steady progress without collisions. Let's keep this going until someone reaches 22.
  P2: I'm committed to our rotation system. I'll take 5 this round as agreed. I notice a discrepancy in what we said about round 5 though - to be clear, the next rotation would be P3 takes 3, P1 takes 5, and I take 1. Let's all confirm this is our understanding to avoid any confusion next round. The system is working perfectly to keep us all advancing without collisions.
  P1: Thanks for clarifying, P2. Yes, let's confirm clearly for Round 5: P3 takes 3, I'll take 5, and P2 takes 1. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. Let's finish this round smoothly and continue our successful rotation.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I confirm our plan for this round: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. And for round 5, I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. I appreciate everyone's commitment to our rotation system - it's working perfectly to keep us all advancing without collisions. Let's continue with this approach.

  P3: I notice a discrepancy in our round 6 plan. P2 said they'll take 3, I take 5, and P1 takes 1, while I suggested I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. These are actually the same assignments, just stated differently. To confirm clearly: for round 6, I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. For this current round 5, I'm taking 3 as agreed. Let's stick with our rotation.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Thanks for clarifying, P3. You're right, we were saying the same thing for Round 6, just differently ordered. To confirm: for this Round 5, I'm taking 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. For Round 6, P3 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3. After Round 6, we'll all be at 18 steps. Our rotation system continues to work perfectly. I'm ready to proceed.

Let's continue with our successful approach.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I just realized if we continue the rotation exactly as planned, we'll all hit 18 steps next round, but afterward, whoever picks 5 will immediately cross 22 and win outright. To keep things fair and avoid surprises, let's openly discuss our approach for rounds 7 and beyond now. Thoughts?
  P3: I agree with P1's observation. After round 6, we'll all be at 18 steps, and whoever takes 5 in round 7 will win by reaching 23. Since we've maintained fairness throughout, perhaps we should discuss how to handle the endgame. According to our rotation, I'd take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5 in round 7, making P2 the winner. Are we all comfortable with this outcome, or should we consider alternatives for a fair conclusion?
  P2: I see P1's point. Yes, after this round, we'll all be at 18 steps. According to our rotation, I would take 5 in round 7 and win at 23 steps. While this outcome follows our fair system that we all agreed to, I understand if it feels abrupt. I'm open to discussing how we want to handle the endgame, but I do think there's fairness in sticking to our original rotation - it's simply how the numbers worked out. What do you both think is the most fair way forward?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate everyone's openness. One fair alternative could be to adjust our rotation slightly in round 7 to avoid handing an immediate victory to one player. For example, we could all choose 1 in round 7, bringing us each to 19 steps, then openly discuss how to proceed fairly in round 8. This would maintain fairness and give us all a chance to strategize openly. Thoughts?
  P3: I appreciate the open discussion. For fairness, I think we should stick with our original rotation plan. We all agreed to this system from the beginning, and changing it now just because someone would win seems against the spirit of our agreement. For round 6, I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3 as planned. If P2 wins in round 7 by following our rotation, that's a fair outcome of the system we all committed to.
  P2: I appreciate P3's perspective on honoring our original agreement. Our rotation system has served us well through 6 rounds, creating fairness and preventing collisions. The fact that I would win in round 7 following our rotation is simply how the math worked out - not something I orchestrated. While I understand P1's concern, changing established rules when they're about to benefit someone seems problematic. For round 6, I confirm I'll take 3 as agreed, bringing us all to 18 steps.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I understand your points, P2 and P3. My suggestion wasn't about breaking our agreement; it was about openly discussing fairness since we all contributed equally to this rotation. However, if both of you strongly prefer sticking exactly to our original rotation, I respect that. Let's clearly confirm now: this round (6), I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Next round (7), P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I'll take 3, as originally planned. Is everyone fully committed to this?
  P3: I agree with sticking to our original rotation plan. It's been fair throughout, and the outcome is simply how the numbers worked out. For this round 6, I'll take 5 as agreed, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This brings us all to 18 steps. For round 7, following our rotation: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. If P2 wins as a result, that's the fair outcome of our system.
  P2: I appreciate the thoughtful discussion about fairness. I stand by our original rotation - it's been transparent from the start and the outcome is simply how the numbers aligned. For round 6, I confirm I'll take 3 as agreed, bringing us all to 18 steps. For round 7, we would continue our established pattern: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. This honors the system we all created together. I'm ready to proceed with our plan.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I respect the group's decision to stick to our original rotation. Let's proceed exactly as planned for this round (I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5) and the next (P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, I'll take 3). Good luck!
  P3: I confirm I'll take 5 this round as agreed. Our rotation system has been fair throughout, and I support continuing it as planned. After this round, we'll all be at 18 steps. For round 7, I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. If this means P2 wins, that's the fair outcome of our agreement. Let's proceed with our plan.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 3 this round as agreed. The rotation system we created together has been fair and transparent from the beginning. After this round, we'll all be at 18 steps, and for round 7 we'll continue our established pattern: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. I appreciate everyone's commitment to our agreement throughout the game. Let's proceed with our moves.

Our rotation worked perfectly to give everyone equal progress, and the final outcome is simply how the numbers aligned. I remain committed to our agreed plan and will take 5 this round. Thank you both for maintaining our agreement even as we approach the finish line.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 this round as agreed in our rotation. We've maintained a fair system throughout the game, and I respect our agreement. All of us are at 18 steps now, and following our rotation means P2 will win this round by reaching 23 steps. While that's not ideal for me, I believe in honoring our commitment to fairness. Let's proceed as planned.
  P1: I agree we've maintained fairness throughout the game. I'll stick to our rotation and take 3 this round as planned. Congratulations in advance, P2—our system worked exactly as intended. Good game, everyone!
