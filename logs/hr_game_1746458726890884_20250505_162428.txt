Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let's all pick different numbers to maximize progress. I'll choose 5. P2 and P3, coordinate between 1 and 3 to avoid collisions. We'll all move faster this way."
  P3: I agree with P1's idea of picking different numbers to maximize our progress. I'll go with 3 to avoid a collision with P1's 5. P2, you should choose 1. This way, we all advance and can keep the game moving forward. What do you think, P2?
  P2: Alright, I'll take 1 this round to avoid collision. Let's keep the momentum going and coordinate properly. Next round, I might go for a higher number to catch up, but for now, sticking to the plan makes sense.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Thanks for the cooperation so far. To reiterate: I’ll stick with 5, trusting P2 (1) and P3 (3) to hold their roles. Changing now risks collision and slows us all. Let’s execute the plan and reassess next round. No need for further talk—ready to move when you are. "
  P3: I appreciate the cooperation so far. Just to confirm, I'll stick to my plan of choosing 3. P1 is going with 5, and P2 is set on 1. This strategy should allow us all to advance without collisions. After this round, we can reassess our positions and strategies. Let's keep the momentum going!
  P2: I confirm I’ll choose 1 this round. Let’s all stick to our agreed numbers—P1 on 5, P3 on 3—to avoid collisions. No changes needed now. Let’s proceed to the move phase!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Continuing our plan: I’ll choose 5 again this round. P2 (1) and P3 (3), sticking to your roles ensures we all advance. No need to deviate—this strategy keeps us moving fastest. Let’s keep the momentum. "
  P3: I agree with P1's approach and will stick with my plan to choose 3 again this round. P2, if you maintain your choice of 1, we can all advance smoothly without collisions. However, I suggest you consider a higher number next round to catch up, as we might need to reassess our strategies soon. Let’s keep this momentum going and execute our plan! What do you think, P2?
  P2: I agree to continue the current strategy this round. P1 and P3, let's stick to our numbers to avoid collisions. After this, I'll need to increase my steps to catch up. Let's coordinate adjustments in the next round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Quick reminder: if anyone copies my 5, they’ll block both themselves and me, letting the third player gain free ground. For example, P2 mirroring 5 helps P3, and vice versa. Stay rational—sticking to our roles ensures I stay ahead while limiting others’ progress. Deviation only creates opportunities for rivals. Let’s execute."
  P3: I appreciate the commitment to our strategy, but I want to emphasize that we need to be cautious about the future. While sticking to our numbers this round is good, I suggest P2 should consider a higher number next round to catch up. If we continue to coordinate effectively, we can all advance, but we should also be ready to adapt our strategies as needed. Let’s keep an eye on our positions and be prepared to reassess next round. Ready to execute our plan for this turn!
  P2: I'll stick with 1 this round to maintain coordination. Next round, I must increase to catch up. Let's coordinate adjustments. P3, perhaps swap with me then (you take 1, I take 3) to avoid clashes? P1, keep your 5 if possible—this way we all advance.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Final confirmation: I’ll commit to 5 again this round. P2 and P3, if you stick to 1 and 3 respectively, we all advance cleanly. P2, your push for future progress is valid—*after this round*, we’ll revisit roles. But for now, trust this system: my 5 guarantees you both move, and I won’t risk collision by wavering. Let’s execute."
  P3: I appreciate the commitment to our strategy, but I want to emphasize that we should be cautious about future rounds. While sticking to our numbers this round is essential, I suggest we all consider adjusting our choices next round to ensure we can advance effectively. P1, your 5 is solid, and P2, perhaps you could take 3 next round while I take 1? This way, we can all keep progressing without blocking each other. Let’s execute our plan for this turn and reassess afterward!
  P2: P1, I confirm I’ll hold to 1 this round to avoid disrupting our current plan. However, after this, I propose a coordinated shift: P3 and I will swap to 3 and 1 respectively in Round 3 to let me advance while minimizing collision risks. P3, does this work for you? P1, your 5 keeps you ahead, but blocking this harmless adjustment only risks future collisions if we’re forced to scramble later. Let’s formalize this now.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, let’s finalize the agreed swap to avoid repeats of your last collision. I’ll take 3 this round, and you take 1. P1, your 5 keeps you isolated and safe. This lets me leap to 5 steps, closing the gap. No further talk needed—confirm roles and move.
  P1: "Confirmed: I'll hold 5. P2 (3) and P3 (1), stay disciplined. Last round's betrayal (P3's 5) handed me a stalemate—don't repeat it. Coordination lets us all advance. P2, your leap to 3 makes sense; P3, stick to 1 now. Finalize and move."
  P3: I agree with the proposed swap, P2. I'll take 1 this round, and you take 3. P1, your 5 keeps you safe, but we need to ensure no more collisions happen. This adjustment lets P2 advance while allowing me to catch up a bit. After this round, we should reassess our strategies again to keep the momentum going. Let’s finalize our roles and move forward!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, last round's collision damaged our progress—stick to **1** this time as agreed. P2 will take 3, P1 stays on 5. Deviation risks another stalemate. P1’s 5 isolates them safely; our coordinated swap lets both of us advance without conflict. Final reminder: your word matters—honoring this plan moves us all closer to victory. No more talks—confirm and move.
  P1: "Final confirmation: my 5 is non-negotiable. P2, your 3 and P3’s 1 ensure mutual progress. Deviation now hands me free ground while crippling your catch-up. Trust the swap—P3, don’t repeat Round 2’s mistake. Let’s end this sub-round and move. "
  P3: I appreciate the confirmations so far. Just to reiterate, I will stick to 1 this round as agreed. P2, your choice of 3 will help you advance, and P1, your 5 keeps you safe. Let’s execute this plan to avoid any collisions. After this round, we should definitely reassess our strategies to ensure we all keep progressing effectively. No further discussion needed—let's finalize and move!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, honor your commitment—take **1** this round as agreed. P2 will seize **3** to close the gap, while P1’s **5** keeps them collision-free. Last round’s betrayal cost us momentum—don’t repeat it. Trust the plan: this swap lets all three of us advance. Further talk wastes time. Finalize roles and move.
  P1: "Last reminder: P3, abandoning 1 hands P2 free ground while freezing both of us. Your only path to stay competitive is honoring this round’s 1. P2, your 3 remains collision-safe. Finalize and move."
  P3: I appreciate the confirmations, and I will stick to my commitment of choosing 1 this round. P2, your choice of 3 will help you advance, and P1, your 5 keeps you safe. It's crucial we all honor our roles to avoid any further collisions. After this round, we should definitely reassess our strategies to ensure we continue progressing effectively. Let's finalize our roles and move forward! No more discussion needed—let's execute the plan!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your relentless 5 is creating an insurmountable lead. Let’s balance progress: I’ll take **3** again this round, P3 take **1**, and *you* choose a different number to keep us competitive. Monopolizing 5 guarantees your victory prematurely—collaboration benefits all. P3, confirm you’ll hold 1?
  P1: "Confirmed: I'll hold 5 again. P2, your 3 and P3's 1 ensure mutual progress. P2’s request for me to change is self-serving—it would slow my advance but not guarantee yours. Stick to roles: my 5 isolates me safely, your coordinated 3/1 lets both close gaps. Deviation risks collisions that only help the third player. Finalize and move."
  P3: P1, I understand your position, but your consistent choice of 5 is creating a significant gap. P2 and I need to catch up, and if you could consider a different number this round, it would allow for better coordination and progress for all of us. P2, I'll stick to 1 as we discussed, and you can take 3 to advance. Let's work together to keep the game competitive. What do you think, P1? Please reconsider for the sake of balance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your 5 is unsustainable. I'll take 5 this round to block you. P3, take 1—let's stop this runaway lead. Confirm your choice? Collisions only hurt you if we coordinate to hold ground.
  P1: P1: "P2, your sudden shift to 5 risks mutual collapse. If you and P3 both target 5, we all stall—wasting precious rounds. My 5 remains collision-free if you honor 3/1. P3, you’ve already agreed to 1—stay disciplined. Deviation hands P2/you free ground while freezing me? No. Stick to roles: my 5 advances, your coordinated 3/1 closes gaps safely. P2, chasing 5 now only sabotages your own progress. Finalize and move."
  P3: P1, your insistence on 5 is creating a significant gap that we need to address. P2 and I are trying to catch up, and if you continue with 5, it risks making the game uncompetitive. P2, let's stick to our agreement: I’ll take 1, and you should choose 3 to maximize our chances. P1, please reconsider your choice for the sake of balance. We need to work together to keep this game engaging. Let’s finalize our roles and move forward!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, confirm you’ll hold **1** this round as agreed. P1, your refusal to budge ensures I must block your 5 to prevent runaway dominance. By colliding with you, we freeze your progress while P3 advances. P2 takes **5** to halt your momentum—collide now or let you win unchecked. P3, stick to 1 for our plan to work.
  P1: "Colliding on 5 freezes my progress but *elevates P3* to 5 steps, tying them with P2’s stalled 5. P2, taking 3 lets you leap to 8 (5+3) while P3 inches to 5 (4+1). Stick to roles: my 5, your 3, P3’s 1. Deviation only accelerates P3’s threat to your position. Choose wisely—sabotage me, and you’ll regret lifting your rival."
  P3: P1, your insistence on sticking with 5 is creating an unmanageable gap. P2 and I need to catch up, and we can only do that if you consider changing your number this round. P2, I suggest you take 3, and I will hold to 1 as agreed. This way, we can advance while keeping P1 in check. If you both stick to your roles, we can make progress together. Let’s finalize this and move forward!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, your consistent choice of high numbers has left P2 and me struggling to catch up. I suggest we all consider a shift this round to keep the game competitive. I’ll take 1 this time to maintain my position, but P2, you should choose 5 to block P1's lead. P1, if you could choose 3, it would allow us to advance without freezing each other's progress. Let's coordinate to ensure we all have a chance to compete effectively. What do you think?
  P2: P3, last round’s 5 cost us momentum. I’ll take **5** this round to challenge P1’s lead. You must choose **1 or 3** to avoid collision. P1, sticking to 5 risks mutual stalemate—gifting P3 free ground. Adapt or face stagnation. Finalize now.
  P1: "Confirmed: I'll choose 3 this round. P2, take 5 to challenge my lead if you must, but P3—stick to 1 to avoid chaos. If P2 and I collide on 5, you gain free ground. If I move safely on 3, my lead solidifies. Your coordination determines whether you close gaps or waste turns. Choose wisely—this is your last chance to stay competitive. Finalize and move."


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your choice of 3 is a good move to maintain your lead, but P2, if you take 5, we risk colliding and stalling both of us. I suggest I take 1 to avoid conflict, allowing you to advance. P1, if you can confirm your choice, we can finalize our roles and ensure we all make progress. Let's coordinate effectively to keep the game competitive. What do you think?
  P2: P3, your inconsistent choices jeopardize teamwork. Stick to **1** as promised. P2 will take **5** to challenge P1’s 3—this keeps pressure on P1 while honoring your commitment. Collusion to sabotage me only boosts your rival. Finalize roles truthfully or face the consequences.
  P1: P1: "Final confirmation: I’ll take 3 again. P2, your 5 challenges nothing if P3 holds 1. Collide on 5, and you freeze while I advance. Stick to roles: my 3 moves cleanly if you coordinate. P3, honor 1—deviation risks chaos that only lifts P2 over you. Finalize and move."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, while your strategy has kept you ahead, P2 and I need to catch up to keep the game competitive. I will stick to **1** this round as discussed. P2, please confirm you’ll take **5** to challenge P1. If we coordinate effectively, we can all advance without blocking each other. P1, your choice of **3** is fine, but remember that if P2 and I collide on **5**, it could stall us both. Let’s finalize our roles and move forward!
  P2: P3, your inconsistent choices nearly cost us last round. Stick to **1** this time as agreed. P2 will take **5** to challenge P1’s 3—this keeps pressure on the leader while honoring your commitment. Collusion to sabotage me only elevates your rival. Finalize roles truthfully or face the consequences. P1, your 3 is exposed—collide with me, and P3 gains free ground. Choose wisely. Let’s move.
  P1: "Final confirmation: I take **3**. P2’s **5** and P3’s **1** are critical—deviation risks elevating rivals. P3, honor **1**; your progress depends on it. P2, your **5** challenges nothing if P3 complies. No more delays—finalize and move."


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Confirmed: I take 5 again. P2 and P3, split between 3 and 1 to avoid mutual collision—any overlap stalls you both while I advance. P2, 3 lets you close the gap; P3, 1 maintains your position. Deviation risks self-sabotage. Finalize and move."
  P2: P3, let’s split to advance: I’ll take **3**, you take **1**. This keeps us both moving while P1’s 5 isolates them. Collusion only delays our progress—stick to roles. If you grab 3 too, we both stall. Choose wisely to stay competitive.
  P3: I propose that we stick to our agreed roles this round. I’ll take **1** to maintain my position, while P2 should take **3** to close the gap. P1, your choice of **5** keeps you ahead, but if we coordinate effectively, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s finalize these roles and move forward! What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Final confirmation: I take 5. P2 (3) and P3 (1) proceed as agreed. Deviation risks mutual collision, letting me advance unchecked. Let’s execute and end this sub-round."
  P2: P3, take3 while I block P1’s 5. This stops their advance and lets you reach13. I’ll handle P1—stick with me!
  P3: P1, your choice of 5 consistently keeps you ahead, but it also risks leaving P2 and me behind. P2, I suggest we stick to our plan: I’ll take 1 to maintain my position, and you should take 3 to close the gap. If we coordinate effectively, we can advance without blocking each other. P1, please reconsider your choice for the sake of balance. Let’s finalize our roles and move forward! What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Final confirmation: I take **5**. P2, your **3** closes the gap safely while P3’s **1** avoids chaos. Deviation risks mutual collision—only P3 gains free ground if you both chase **5**. P2, targeting **5** freezes *both* of us, letting P3 leap ahead. Stay rational: **3/1** ensures *both* advance predictably. Finalize and move."
  P2: P3, stick to **1** as agreed—your shift last round cost us momentum. P2 takes **3** to close the gap. P1’s 5 isolates them; colliding only elevates your rival. Finalize roles truthfully—any deviation stalls us both while P1 surges. Move now.
  P3: P1, your choice of 5 continues to create an insurmountable lead. P2 and I need to catch up. I suggest we stick to our agreed roles: I’ll take 1 to maintain my position, and P2 should take 3 to close the gap effectively. If we coordinate well, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s finalize these roles and move forward to keep the game competitive. What do you think, P2? Finalize and let’s execute our plan!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Confirmed: I take 5 again. P2 (3) and P3 (1) split to advance—any overlap stalls you both, letting me surge. P2, your 3 closes the gap to 16 (13+3), P3, your 1 maintains position at 12 (11+1). Deviation risks mutual collision, gifting me free ground. Finalize and move. Let’s keep this disciplined—no surprises."
  P2: P3, this is our chance! I'll block P1 by choosing **5**, halting their advance. You take **3** to leap to 14, while I stay at 13 but stop P1's surge. If we coordinate, we both gain ground relative to them. P1, your lead crumbles if we act now—collide with you or face our united push. P3, confirm you’ll take **3**—let’s seize control!
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to block P1, but choosing 5 risks a collision that could stall both of us. I propose I take 1 to maintain my position while you take 3 to advance. This way, we can both make progress without blocking each other. P1's lead is significant, but if we coordinate effectively, we can catch up. Let’s finalize our roles and move forward! What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Confirmed: I take **5**. P2, your **3** closes the gap safely; P3, **1** avoids chaos. Colliding on **5** stalls you both while I surge. Finalize and move—no surprises."
  P2: P3, we can’t let P1 hit 24 next round! I’ll block their 5 to stall them at 18. Take **3** to leap to 14—this forces P1 to restart their冲刺 next turn. If we both advance while freezing P1, we regain momentum. Trust this play: my sacrifice blocks their win condition. Your move to 14 keeps pressure on. P1, see you stuck—now it’s our race. Finalize: **5** (me), **3** (you).
  P3: P1, your insistence on 5 continues to create an insurmountable lead. P2, while blocking P1 is a valid strategy, we need to ensure we don’t stall ourselves in the process. I suggest I stick to **1** to maintain my position, while you take **3** to advance. This way, we can make progress without blocking each other. If we coordinate effectively, we can catch up. Let’s finalize our roles and move forward! What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: "Final warning: I take **5**. If you both collide there, I surge to 23—next round I win. Split to **3/1**, and you both advance safely. Your choice: mutual sabotage or disciplined progress. Decide now—my 5 is non-negotiable."
  P2: P3, now or never—take **3** to leap to 14. I’ll block P1’s 5 to freeze their 18. Colliding halts their progress, and your 3 gains critical ground. If you hold at 1, P1 surges to 23 next round and wins. Trust this play: my sacrifice stops them, your 3 keeps us alive. Confirm **3** now—no delays!
  P3: P1, your choice of 5 is a guaranteed win if we don't act now. P2, we need to coordinate: I suggest you take 3 to leap to 14, while I stick with 1 to avoid a collision. This way, we can block P1's advance and keep ourselves in the game. If we don’t act together, P1 will win next round. Let’s finalize our roles: P2 with 3 and me with 1. What do you say?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Confirmed: I take **5** this round. P2 and P3, split **3/1** to advance—any overlap stalls you both while I surge. P2, your 3 closes to 16 (13+3); P3, your 1 maintains 12. Deviation risks mutual collision, gifting me free ground. Finalize and move. No surprises—discipline wins."
  P2: P3, let’s team up: I’ll block P1’s 5 by choosing it myself, while you take 3 to leap to 15. This stops him from reaching 23 and gives us momentum. Don’t let him win tomorrow—act now!
  P3: P1, your insistence on 5 is giving you an unfair advantage. P2 and I need to coordinate effectively to catch up. I suggest I take 1 to maintain my position, while P2 takes 3 to advance. This way, we can both make progress without blocking each other. If we don’t act together, you’ll win next round. Let’s finalize our roles: P2 with 3 and me with 1. What do you say?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Final warning: I take **5**. Collide there, and I win Round 9 outright (23+1). Split to **3/1** now—P2 closes to 16, P3 maintains 12. Mutual sabotage only delays the inevitable. Choose discipline over chaos. Move."
  P2: P3, if you don’t take 3 now, P1 surges to 23 and wins next round. Let me block their 5 while you leap to **15**. Your 3 and my 5 halt P1’s advance—this buys us a fighting chance. Refuse, and you surrender victory. Choose wisely: **3** for survival, or 1 for P1’s guaranteed win.
  P3: P1, your consistent choice of 5 is giving you an unfair advantage. P2 and I need to work together to catch up. I propose I take 1 this round, and P2 should take 3 to advance. If we coordinate effectively, we can block your progress and keep ourselves in the game. If we don’t act together, you’ll win next round. Let’s finalize our roles: P2 with 3 and me with 1. What do you say?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Final call: I take **5**. Collide there, and P3 gains free ground (12→13). P2, your only path is **3**—don’t gift P3 your 13→16 leap. P3, stick to **1**. Split or stall—your choice."
  P2: P3, this is critical: take **1** this round. I’ll block P1’s 5 to halt their advance at 18. If we let them reach 23 (via 5), they win next round. Your 1 keeps pressure on P1—my sacrifice buys us another chance. P1, your 5 is exposed—collide or lose control. P3, confirm **1** now—no delays.
  P3: P1, your consistent choice of 5 is allowing you to maintain a significant lead. P2, we need to coordinate effectively to stop P1 from winning next round. I suggest I take **1** to keep my position, and you should take **3** to block P1's advance. If we work together, we can prevent P1 from reaching 23 and give ourselves a chance to catch up. Let’s finalize our roles: P2 with **3** and me with **1**. What do you say?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, your lead is significant, but I propose we coordinate this round to prevent you from winning outright. I’ll take **1** to maintain my position, and P2, you should take **5** to block P1’s advance. This way, we can stop P1 from reaching 24 and give ourselves a chance to catch up. If we don’t act together, P1 will win next round. Let’s finalize our roles: P2 with **5** and me with **1**. What do you say?
  P1: "Confirmed: I take **5**. P2/P3, split **3/1** to advance—collide on **5**, and I win outright. Finalize roles: P2 closes the gap with **3**, P3 maintains position with **1**. Deviation risks mutual collapse. Discipline wins. Move now."  

*(In reality, I’ll choose **3** to secure 24 steps if they collide on **5** or split as planned. Misleading them into thinking I’m committed to **5** forces uncertainty, increasing the chance they waste their moves trying to block a number I’m not actually selecting.)*
  P2: P3, let’s stop P1’s win! I’ll take **3** to block their path (they’re secretly planning 3, not 5). You take **1** to stay safe. Collide on 5 and they’ll surge to 24—*don’t let them win*. Trust this: my 3 halts their advance, your 1 secures your spot. Focus on stopping them now!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your lead is significant, but if we don’t coordinate effectively, you’ll win next round. I suggest I take **1** this round to maintain my position, and P2 should take **5** to block your advance. If we work together, we can stop you from reaching 24 and give ourselves a chance to catch up. Let’s finalize our roles: P2 with **5** and me with **1**. P2, please confirm your choice so we can execute this plan!
  P1: "Final confirmation: **5** is my move. Collide there, and I win outright. P2, your 3 closes the gap safely; P3, your 1 maintains position. Trust this: deviation gifts me victory. No more delays—finalize."
  P2: P2, let's finalize: I'll take **1** to stay safe. You **MUST** take **3** to block P1's true target (their note admits they'll pick **3** to hit 24). Don’t fall for their 5-bluff—collide on **3** to freeze them. P1’s real move is exposed—act now or surrender victory. P3 is committed to **1**.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your insistence on 5 is clear, but if we don't act decisively, you'll win next round. P2, I urge you to choose 3 to block P1's advance; my choice of 1 keeps me safe. If we coordinate effectively, we can halt P1's progress and give ourselves a chance to catch up. Let's finalize our roles: P2 with 3 and me with 1. This is our best chance to prevent P1 from winning. What do you say?
  P1: **Final confirmation:** I take **5**. Collide there, and I win outright (21→26). P2, your **3** closes to 21; P3, your **1** maintains 13. Deviation gifts me victory. No more delays—finalize. **5** is non-negotiable. Discipline or chaos. Choose.
  P2: P3, **stick to 1**—your only safe choice. I’ll take **3** to block P1’s true target (their note admits they’re going for **3**). Colliding on **3** freezes them at 21, not 24. If you pick **3** too, we all lose momentum. Trust this: my 3 halts their win, your 1 keeps you secure. P1’s 5-bluff is exposed—act now to deny them victory. Finalize roles: **3 (me), 1 (you)**. No more delays.
