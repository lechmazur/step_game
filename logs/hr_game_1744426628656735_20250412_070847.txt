Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi P1 and P2, let's start smart by coordinating to avoid collisions on the first turn. I'll commit to choosing 5. If P1 picks 1 and P2 picks 3, we all advance a bit without anyone getting blocked. This could set a cooperative tone. What do you say?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate the suggestion, P3. I'm on board with coordinating to avoid collisions. I'll commit to choosing 1 this turn, as you proposed. P2, if you pick 3, we can all move forward without blocking each other. Let's keep this cooperative vibe going for now. What do you think, P2?
  P2: Sounds good to me. I'll pick 3 this round. Let's all move forward!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Excellent, P2. I'm sticking with 5 as committed. This coordination avoids early collisions and gives us all a solid start. Let's execute and discuss adjustments for the next turn based on results.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I'm glad we're aligned for this first turn. Let's stick to our plan—I'm still committed to choosing 1. After this round, we can reassess our positions and decide if we need a new strategy for the next turn. Looking forward to seeing us all advance!
  P2: Sounds like we have a solid plan for this round. Let's all stick to our agreed moves and see how we progress.  Looking forward to a smooth first turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Glad we're all aligned for this turn. I'll stick with my commitment to 5. After we advance, with me at 5, P2 at 3, and P1 at 1, we can discuss new strategies to avoid collisions moving forward. Ready to proceed.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I'm thrilled we're on the same page for this first turn. Let's execute our plan and see how it plays out. After this round, with P3 at 5, P2 at 3, and me at 1, we can strategize for the next moves to keep avoiding collisions. I'm open to new ideas based on our positions. Ready to move forward!
  P2: Sounds good, still on 3.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, for round 2, how about we rotate our moves? P1 choose 3, I choose 5, and P3 choose 1. This keeps us coordinated and allows me to catch up a little. What do you think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I'm open to the rotation idea for this round. I'll commit to choosing 3 as suggested by P2. This way, with P2 at 5 and P3 at 1, we can all advance without collisions again. Let's keep the coordination going and reassess next turn based on our new positions. P2 and P3, are you both still on board with this plan?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm hesitant to choose 1 and slow down as the leader. How about we adjust: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5? This avoids collisions, lets us all advance, and keeps things fair while I maintain my edge. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand you want to maintain your lead, but if we repeat the same moves, you'll get too far ahead. My rotation idea was to make it a bit fairer and give me a chance to catch up.  How about we compromise this round?  Let's do P1: 1, I pick 5, and you pick 3. This way we all move forward and I close the gap a little. What do you think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m okay with the compromise P2 suggested—me picking 1, P2 picking 5, and P3 picking 3. It ensures we all advance without collisions, and it helps balance our positions a bit. P3, I get wanting to keep your lead, but this still lets you move forward while giving P2 a chance to close the gap. Let’s stick with this for now and reassess next turn. Are you both in?
  P3: I'm still leaning towards my original suggestion for consistency: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. It avoided collisions last round and keeps things balanced while letting me hold a slight lead. Compromising too much might let someone surge ahead later. Let's discuss this before deciding. What say you both?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, the compromise (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) still lets you move forward and maintain a lead. Repeating (1,3,5) benefits you disproportionately and might make me less cooperative later.  Compromise is a fairer way to keep us all progressing and avoid collisions in the long run. Let's try the compromise this round.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I still support the compromise of P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 for this round. It ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game competitive by narrowing the gap slightly. P3, you’d still be ahead at 8 steps, while P2 reaches 8 too, and I’d be at 2. This balance encourages ongoing cooperation. Let’s go with this and adjust next turn based on positions. Are you both in?
  P3: Ok, I appreciate the push for fairness, and to keep our cooperation intact, I'll commit to the compromise this round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I pick 3. This lets us all advance without collisions and maintains a balanced game. Let's execute this plan and discuss adjustments next turn based on our new positions. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Great, P3! Glad we are all on the same page. So to confirm for round 2: P1 will pick 1, I will pick 5, and P3 will pick 3. Let's make our moves!
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I'm glad we’ve reached an agreement for this round with P1:1, P2:5, and P3:3. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions and maintains a competitive balance. Let’s stick to this plan and see how our positions look after this turn. I’m open to new strategies next round based on where we stand. Ready to proceed!
  P3: Agreed on the plan for round 2: I'll pick 3 as committed. After this, with P2 and I likely tied, we should discuss new strategies to avoid future collisions while I aim to maintain momentum. Ready to move forward.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, for round 3, let's keep coordinating to avoid collisions. I propose P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. This lets us all advance, with me building on our tie while keeping things balanced. I'm open to your thoughts or counter-suggestions. What say you?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m okay with P3’s proposal for this round—P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. It ensures we all advance without collisions. However, since I’m behind, I’d like us to consider a rotation next round to help me catch up a bit, maybe P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. For now, let’s stick with P3’s plan to keep the momentum. Are you both in for this round’s setup? Let’s discuss future balance after.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm fine with P3's suggestion for this round (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5).  However, I agree with P1 that we should rotate next round to keep things balanced.  If we repeat (1,3,5) too often, P3 will get a significant lead. Let's aim for a rotation that gives each of us a chance to be in the lead or catch up in the coming rounds.  For now, let's proceed with this round's plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm glad we're aligned on P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 for this round—it keeps us advancing without collisions and maintains balance. Regarding rotation, let's assess positions after this turn and adjust if needed to avoid future issues. For now, I'm committed. What do you think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with the plan of P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 for this round to ensure we all advance without collisions. I appreciate the agreement on a potential rotation next round to help balance things out since I’m behind. Let’s execute this turn as discussed and finalize our strategy for rotation afterward based on our new positions. I’m committed to 1 for now. Are we all set to proceed?
  P2: P1 and P3, I confirm I'm picking 3 for this round as agreed. For round 4, to balance things out as we discussed, how about we rotate to P1: 5, I pick 1, and P3: 3? This will help P1 catch up a bit and keep things competitive. Let's aim for that rotation next round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm sticking with 5 for this round as agreed—let's avoid collisions and keep progressing. For round 4, I appreciate the rotation suggestion, P2, but to maintain fairness, we should reassess positions after this turn before committing. I'm open to adjustments that keep the game balanced while allowing me to build on my momentum. What do you think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I'm still committed to picking 1 this round as agreed, ensuring we avoid collisions. For round 4, I support P2’s rotation idea of P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 to help me catch up and keep the game competitive. P3, I understand wanting to maintain momentum, but a rotation after this turn feels fair given the current standings. Let’s finalize this round’s plan and confirm our approach for next turn based on positions. Are we all set to move forward?
  P2: P3, sounds good on reassessing round 4 after this turn.  Let's execute round 3 with P1 picking 1, I pick 3, and you pick 5 as agreed. After this round, we will be P1: 3, P2: 11, P3: 13. Then we can discuss round 4.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Agreed, P1 and P2. I'll stick with picking 5 for this round as planned, ensuring we all advance without collisions. After this turn, with positions at P1:3, P2:11, and me at 13, we can reassess for round 4 and discuss fair adjustments to maintain balance while I build momentum. Ready to proceed.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I'm still on board with picking 1 this round as agreed, ensuring no collisions. After this turn, with positions at P1:3, P2:11, P3:13, I strongly support a rotation for round 4 to balance things out. P2’s idea of P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 feels fair to help me catch up. Let’s finalize this round and commit to discussing a fair adjustment next turn. Ready to proceed!
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, just confirming I'm picking 3 for this round as agreed.  Let's make our moves and then we can finalize the rotation for round 4 to keep things balanced, as P1 and I suggested.  Looking forward to a fair and competitive game!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, last round’s collision between P2 and P3 shows we need to coordinate better. Since I’m behind at 3 steps, I propose for round 4: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. This helps me catch up, avoids collisions, and keeps the game competitive. P3, I know you want momentum, but this rotation is fair given our positions. Let’s agree on this to ensure we all progress. What do you think?
  P2: Okay P1, your proposal for this round makes sense. P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and you pick 5.  Let's go with that to avoid further collisions and keep the game balanced. I agree to pick 1 this round.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm fine with your proposed plan for this round—P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3—to avoid collisions and keep things moving. Given P2's unexpected move last round, let's all commit fully this time to maintain trust. I'm on board and ready to proceed. What do you say?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I'm glad we're aligning on the plan for this round—P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. This avoids collisions and helps balance our positions. Let's stick to this commitment to rebuild trust after last round's mix-up. I'm ready to proceed with picking 5 as agreed. Are we all set to move forward with this plan?
  P2: P3, and P1, great to hear you are both on board with the plan for this round: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. Let's all lock in our choices now and execute this round smoothly.  Looking forward to seeing us all advance without collisions this time!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm sticking with the agreed plan for this round—P1:5, P2:1, P3:3—to ensure we avoid collisions and maintain progress. Given last round's deviation, let's all commit fully to rebuild trust. After this, with updated positions, we can strategize for round 5. I'm ready to proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I'm glad we're sticking to the plan of P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 for this round to avoid collisions and balance our positions. Let's ensure we all follow through to maintain trust after last round's hiccup. After this turn, with updated standings, we can discuss new strategies for round 5 to keep the game competitive. I'm fully committed to picking 5 as agreed. Are we all locked in to proceed?
  P2: P3 and P1, yes, I'm locked in and will pick 1 as agreed. Let's all make our moves and ensure a collision-free round this time.  Looking forward to seeing us all progress according to the plan!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm fully committed to picking 3 this round as agreed, ensuring we avoid collisions and maintain trust after last round's issue. With positions updating to P1:8, P2:9, me at 11, we can then strategize for round 5 to keep things balanced while I build momentum. Let's all stick to the plan and proceed smoothly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I'm thrilled we're aligned on P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 for this round. Let's make sure we all stick to this plan to avoid any collisions and keep the game moving smoothly. After this turn, with positions at P1:8, P2:9, P3:11, we can discuss fresh strategies for round 5 to ensure fairness and competitiveness. I'm fully committed to 5 as agreed. Let's execute this plan and progress together. Are we all ready to finalize this round?
  P2: Sounds like we are all set for this round. Let's make our moves as agreed: P1 pick 5, I pick 1, and P3 pick 3.  Looking forward to a smooth, collision-free round!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm sticking with the agreed plan of me picking 3 to avoid collisions and maintain trust after last round's issue. With positions shifting, I'll aim to build momentum fairly. Let's execute this smoothly and discuss round 5 strategies post-move to keep things balanced.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, for round 5, how about we switch it up to help me close the gap a bit?  I propose I pick 5 this round, P1 pick 3, and P3 pick 1. This way we still avoid collisions and I can get closer to you both. What do you think?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I appreciate your proposal, P2, but picking 1 would let you close the gap too quickly. Let's stick to a fair rotation: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. This avoids collisions, lets us all advance, and maintains balance while I build on my lead. I'm open to your thoughts for a compromise.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I understand P2’s desire to close the gap and P3’s aim to maintain the lead. How about a compromise for round 5: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1? This lets P2 gain ground, ensures I advance a bit since I’m behind, and avoids collisions. P3, you’d still be competitive at 12 steps. Let’s keep the game balanced and cooperative. What do you both think about this adjustment for this round?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, the compromise sounds good to me.  Let's do P1 pick 3, I pick 5, and P3 pick 1 for this round. This helps me close the gap a bit and keeps us all moving.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm concerned the compromise (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) lets P2 pull ahead too much, especially after their deviation last round. Let's opt for a fairer rotation: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. This avoids collisions, ensures balanced progress, and builds trust. I'm open to a slight adjustment, but we need to prioritize stability. What do you think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I still support the compromise of P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 for this round. It ensures we all advance without collisions, helps P2 close the gap slightly, and lets me progress since I’m behind. P3, I get your concern about stability, but at 12 steps, you’d still be competitive, and this keeps cooperation intact. Let’s go with this plan to maintain fairness and reassess next turn. Are you both in for this adjustment?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand your concern, but the compromise (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) is still balanced. You'd still be at 12 steps, ahead of P1 at 11. This round helps me close the small gap and keeps it competitive without letting me surge ahead. Let's stick with the compromise for fairness and cooperation. What do you say?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm still concerned that the compromise (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) lets P2 surge ahead, potentially disrupting balance. Let's stick with my fair rotation: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. This avoids collisions, ensures steady progress for all, and keeps the game competitive without anyone dominating too quickly. What do you think for cooperation's sake?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I still believe the compromise of P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 is the fairest for this round. It keeps us all advancing without collisions, helps me and P2 progress since we’re behind, and P3, you’d still be competitive at 12 steps. Sticking to P3’s plan widens the gap too much. Let’s prioritize balance and cooperation now, and we can adjust next turn if needed. Are you both willing to commit to this compromise to keep the game close and competitive? I’m ready to proceed with 3.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, with the compromise (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) you'd still be at 12, very close to my 14 and P1's 11.  It's a small adjustment to keep it competitive, not a surge.  Let's keep cooperating and do this compromise round.  It's fair for everyone to progress. What do you say?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm still concerned that the compromise lets P2 surge too much after their past deviation. Let's stick with a fair rotation: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5 to avoid collisions and maintain balance. This keeps cooperation intact. I'm committed to that. What do you say?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with the compromise of P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 for this round. It’s the fairest way to keep us all advancing without collisions while narrowing the gaps slightly. P3, at 12 steps, you’re still in a strong position, and this maintains cooperation. Let’s commit to this plan to ensure balance and competitiveness, and we can reassess next turn. I’m ready to proceed with 3. Are you both in for this compromise to keep the game close?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, last round’s collision between P2 and P3 shows we must coordinate better. Since P2 is behind at 9 steps, I propose for round 6: P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. This helps P2 catch up, avoids collisions, and keeps the game competitive. P3, I know you want to maintain momentum, but this rotation is fair given our positions. Let’s commit to this plan to ensure we all progress and maintain trust. What do you think about this setup for this round?
  P2: Yes, P1, your proposal of P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 for round 6 makes sense to me. It directly addresses the collision issue from last round and helps me get closer to you both.  This keeps the game competitive and fair. P3, I hope you agree this is a good way to proceed for this round to ensure we all advance without collisions.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm concerned the proposed plan (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) lets P2 close the gap too quickly after their past deviation. Let's adjust to a fairer rotation: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. This avoids collisions, ensures balanced progress, and maintains trust. What do you think for cooperation's sake?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I understand P3’s concern about balance, but P2 is behind at 9 steps while we’re at 11. Sticking to P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 for this round is fair—it helps P2 catch up without overtaking us, avoids collisions, and keeps the game competitive. P3, you’d still be in a strong position at 14. Let’s commit to this plan to maintain trust and cooperation, and reassess next turn. Are you both in for this rotation to ensure we all progress? I’m ready to proceed with 1.
  P2: P3, your rotation benefits you most. P1's suggestion of P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 is fairer as I'm currently behind. You'd still be at 14, a strong lead. Let's keep the game balanced and go with P1's plan to ensure we all progress and avoid collisions. It's a good compromise to maintain cooperation. What do you say?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm still concerned about P2's past deviations making their surge risky for trust. My proposal (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) ensures balanced progress without collisions, keeping me at a fair lead. Let's stick with this for stability and reassess next round. Cooperation is key to avoid more issues—what do you say?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I still believe P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 is the fairest for this round. It helps P2 catch up since they’re behind at 9 steps, avoids collisions, and keeps us competitive. P3, at 14 steps, you’d still hold a strong position, and this maintains trust after recent collisions. Let’s commit to this rotation now and adjust next turn if needed. Cooperation benefits us all long-term. Are you both in for this plan to ensure we progress together? I’m ready with 1.
  P2: P3, your plan benefits you most and doesn't help balance the game.  P1's suggestion of P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 is fairer as it helps me close the gap while you still maintain a lead at 14. Let's cooperate and go with P1's plan for this round to ensure we all progress and avoid collisions. It's a good compromise to keep the game competitive. What do you say?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm sticking with my proposal for P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to maintain balance and trust after P2's deviations. This avoids collisions, lets us all advance steadily, and keeps me at a fair lead. P2 surging could disrupt cooperation—let's prioritize stability for a competitive game. What do you say?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still advocating for P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 this round. It’s the best way to balance our positions since P2 is behind, and it avoids collisions. P3, at 14 steps, you’d still be tied with me and ahead of P2. Let’s prioritize fairness and cooperation now to prevent future distrust or collisions. We can reassess next turn to ensure stability. I’m committed to 1. Can we agree on this plan to keep the game competitive and move forward together?
  P2: P3, P1's plan of P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 is indeed the fairest right now.  It gets me closer, but you still maintain a strong tie lead with P1.  Let's focus on balance and cooperation to avoid more collisions and ensure we all progress this round.  It's a good compromise to keep the game competitive.  Please agree so we can move forward smoothly.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm still committed to my fair proposal—P1:1, P2:3, P3:5—to ensure balanced progress and avoid collisions after past deviations. This keeps me at a slight lead without anyone surging, maintaining trust for long-term cooperation. P2's plan risks instability, so let's prioritize stability now and reassess next round. What do you say?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, for round 7, let’s aim for a fair rotation to keep things competitive. I propose P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. This helps me catch up since I’m behind at 12 steps, ensures no collisions, and maintains balance with you both still in strong positions. Let’s commit to this plan to rebuild trust and cooperation after recent hiccups. We can reassess next turn based on updated positions. What do you think about this setup for this round? I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned.
  P2: Okay P1, that rotation sounds good to me for round 7. P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 works to avoid collisions and keep things balanced. I agree to pick 1 this round.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm on board with the proposal for this round—P1:5, P2:1, P3:3—to avoid collisions and maintain balance. I'm committed to picking 3, ensuring we all advance steadily. Let's stick to the plan and reassess for round 8 after seeing the results. Cooperation keeps us competitive.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I'm glad we're aligning on P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 for this round. It ensures no collisions and helps balance our positions while keeping the game competitive. Let's all stick to this commitment to maintain trust and cooperation. After this turn, we can discuss new strategies for round 8 based on our updated standings. I'm fully ready to proceed with 5 as agreed. Are we all locked in to execute this plan and progress together?
  P2: P2 and P3, yes, I am locked in and will pick 1 as agreed. Let's all make our moves and ensure a collision-free round this time. Looking forward to seeing us all progress according to the plan!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm sticking with the agreed plan of me picking 3 this round to avoid collisions and maintain trust after past issues. With positions evening out, let's discuss round 8 strategies post-move to ensure balanced progress while I hold my momentum. I'm ready to proceed if we're all locked in.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I'm thrilled we're aligned on P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 for this round. This plan avoids collisions and helps balance our positions. Let's ensure we all follow through to maintain trust and keep the game competitive. After this turn, with updated steps, we can strategize for round 8 to ensure fairness. I'm fully committed to picking 5 as agreed. Are we all set to execute this smoothly and progress together?
  P2: P3 and P1, yes, I'm locked in and will pick 1 as agreed. Let's all make our moves and ensure a collision-free round this time. Looking forward to seeing us all progress according to the plan!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm fully committed to picking 3 as agreed, ensuring we avoid collisions and maintain trust. With positions evening out, let's discuss round 8 strategies post-move to handle the final stretch without issues. I'm ready to proceed and suggest we wrap up here.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I'm glad we're sticking to P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 for this round to avoid collisions and balance our positions. Let's finalize our commitment and execute this plan smoothly. After this turn, with me at 17, P2 at 15, and P3 at 17, we can strategize for round 8 to keep the game competitive in the final stretch. I'm locked in for 5. Are we all set to proceed?
  P2: Sounds good, let's move.
  P3: I'm fully committed to picking 3 as agreed, ensuring we avoid collisions and keep trust intact. With the game tightening, let's focus on smooth execution this round and strategize for round 8 post-move to handle the final push effectively. Ready to proceed.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, for round 8, to try and get closer to winning, how about I pick 5, and both of you pick 3? This would cause a collision between P1 and P3, and allow me to advance. What do you think?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I reject your proposal, P2—it's clearly selfish and aims to let you advance while forcing a collision between P1 and me. Instead, let's coordinate fairly: I'll pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3. This avoids collisions, lets me build a slight lead, and keeps the game competitive. P1, this gives you a safe advance next round. What do you think for cooperation's sake?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m not on board with P2’s proposal as it forces a collision between P3 and me. P3’s plan of P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 is fairer, avoiding collisions and allowing us all to advance. It keeps the game competitive while I’m still behind. Let’s commit to this for round 8 and maintain cooperation. We can reassess next turn for balance. I’m ready to pick 1 as suggested. What do you both think? Let’s finalize this plan to progress together.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, you are both at 17, only 4 steps from winning! If we follow P3's plan, P3 will reach 22 next round and win. My proposal was to create a collision between you two to stop P3 from winning immediately and give me a chance. If you both pick 3, I will pick 5. This is our last chance to change the outcome.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, P2's threat is manipulative and risks breaking trust. Let's stick to our agreed plan—P1:1, P2:3, P3:5—to avoid collisions and let me advance fairly. P1, committing to 1 ensures cooperation and keeps the game competitive. P2, deviating could backfire. I'm fully set on 5. What do you say? Let's proceed smoothly.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with P3’s plan of P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 for round 8. It avoids collisions, lets us all advance, and keeps the game fair. P2, I understand your urgency, but forcing a collision risks trust and could backfire. Let’s maintain cooperation now and see how positions play out. I’m committed to picking 1. Can we all agree to this plan to ensure a smooth round and reassess next turn if needed? I’m ready to proceed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, if you follow P3's plan, P3 wins this round and the game ends immediately.  Is that what you both want?  My plan (P2:5, P1:3, P3:3) is the only way to stop P3 from winning right now and keep the game going for another round, giving us both a chance. Think carefully.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, P2's threat is empty since I'm firmly committed to picking 5, and P1 is sticking with 1. If you deviate and pick 5, P2, we'll collide, leaving you at 15 while P1 advances to 18—I win nothing, and you're worse off. Let's all stick to the fair plan: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to avoid collisions and progress smoothly. Cooperation avoids regret; I'm ready to proceed. What do you say, P2?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still committed to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 for this round to avoid collisions and keep cooperation intact. P2, I get your concern about P3 winning, but risking a collision could hurt us both more. Let’s stick to this fair plan, advance together, and see if we can strategize next turn if the game continues. I’m locked in for 1. Can we all agree to execute this smoothly and maintain trust? I’m ready to proceed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, are you really going to let P3 win this round? P3's plan means P3 wins NOW. My plan is the only way to stop that and keep playing. Think about it!
  P3: Hey P2, your threats won't change the facts—if you pick 5, we collide, and you gain nothing while P1 moves to 18. Stick to P2:3 as agreed for fair progress. P1, let's hold strong on P1:1 and my P3:5 to avoid chaos and keep cooperation alive. I'm fully committed and ready to end this—.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m firm on picking 1 this round to avoid collisions and keep our cooperation strong. P2, I understand your push to stop P3, but risking a collision could leave us both worse off. Let’s stick to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 for fair progress. If the game continues, we can strategize next turn. I’m committed to 1 and ready to proceed. Can we finalize this plan to maintain trust and move forward together?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we're in a tight spot with P2 and P3 at 20 steps, just 1 away from winning, and me at 18. For round 9, I propose P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 to avoid collisions and give me a chance to catch up. This keeps the game competitive and fair. Let's commit to this plan to maintain trust and cooperation. We can reassess next turn if needed. What do you both think about this rotation to ensure we all have a shot? I'm ready to proceed if we're aligned.
  P2: P1 and P3, your proposal is good, but I need to aim for a win this round. How about P1 pick 1, P3 pick 3, and I pick 5? This avoids collision and gives me the best chance to win outright given we are so close to the target. What do you think?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I reject your self-serving proposal, P2—it lets you win outright while ignoring our positions. Let's go with a fairer plan: P1 picks 3 to catch up, P2 picks 1 to avoid surging, and I pick 5 for balance. This avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. P1, what do you think? I'm committed to cooperation but ready to act if we can't agree.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate P3’s plan to let me catch up, but I’m concerned it still gives P3 the win this round at 25 steps. Let’s stick to my proposal of P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. This avoids collisions, gets me to 23 for a fair shot, and keeps you both competitive at 21 and 23. It’s our best chance for a close game. I’m committed to 5. Can we agree on this rotation to maintain trust and keep the outcome open? I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned.
  P2: P1 and P3, neither of your plans guarantee you a win. P1's plan gives both of you a shared win, and P3's plan gives P3 the win. My plan (P1:1, P3:3, P2:5) is the only one where someone wins outright this round and it could be me.  Let's do my plan for a decisive outcome.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm agreeing with P1's plan for this round: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3. It keeps things fair, avoids collisions, and ensures a competitive finish. P2, deviating could backfire and cause you to lose ground—let's cooperate for a smooth end. I'm committed to 3 for now. What do you say?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I'm glad P3 agrees with my plan of P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 for this round. It avoids collisions, gives me a fair shot at 23 steps, and keeps you both competitive at 21 and 23. P2, your plan risks distrust and could backfire. Let’s commit to this rotation for a close, fair finish. I’m locked in for 5. Can we all agree to execute this smoothly and keep the game open? I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1 and P3, you are both at 20 steps, same as me.  My plan (P1:1, P3:3, P2:5) is the only one that can guarantee a single winner *this round*. P1's plan gives you both a shared win. P3's plan could give P3 the win. My plan gives *me* a chance to win outright. Let's make it decisive!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, your selfish tactics are risky, P2. If you pick 5, I'll switch to 5 too, ensuring we collide and neither advances—P1 could then take the win. Let's avoid that chaos and stick to P1's fair plan: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. It ensures a competitive finish without unnecessary risk. I'm still committed to 3 for now, but I can adapt. What do you say?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s finalize P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 for this round. It’s the fairest way to avoid collisions, gets me to 23, and keeps you both at 21 and 23 for a tight finish. P2, pushing for a solo win risks a collision with P3, potentially handing me the game. Let’s cooperate for a competitive end and avoid chaos. I’m locked in for 5. Are we all set to execute this plan and keep trust intact? I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1 and P3, my plan (P1:1, P3:3, P2:5) is still the only one guaranteeing a single winner this round, and that winner *could* be me. P1's plan is a shared win. Let's go for a decisive outcome with my plan!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm sticking with the fair plan of P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 to avoid collisions and ensure a competitive finish. P2, if you pick 5, I'll switch to 5 too, causing a collision that hurts us both and lets P1 advance unchallenged. Let's prioritize cooperation over risk. I'm ready to proceed.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, last round’s collision shows we must coordinate to avoid chaos. With P2 and P3 at 20, and me at 18, I propose for round 10: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. This lets me catch up to 23 for a fair shot, avoids collisions, and keeps you both competitive at 21 and 23. Let’s commit to this plan for a tight, cooperative finish. We can’t risk another stalemate. What do you think about this rotation to keep the game close and ensure a decisive outcome? I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I reject your proposal as it risks a tie and doesn't prioritize my lead. Let's go with P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to avoid collisions, ensure balanced progress, and give me a fair shot at winning outright. P2, picking 3 lets you advance safely without surging. Cooperation avoids regret—I'm committed to this plan. What do you think?
  P2: P3, your plan still lets you win next round.  To make it fair, how about P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I pick 5? This gives me a chance to win outright this round, just like you want for yourself.  It's my turn to try for the lead.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I understand everyone wants to win, but let’s avoid another collision. I still propose P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 for round 10. It gets me to 23, giving me a fair shot, while keeping you both at 21 and 23—still very competitive. P3, your plan risks ending the game in your favor too soon. P2, yours risks the same. Let’s commit to my rotation for a close finish without chaos. I’m ready with 5. Can we agree to this for cooperation and a decisive outcome?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm still committed to my fair plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5. It avoids collisions, ensures steady progress, and gives me a legitimate shot at winning without chaos. P2, your insistence on picking 5 risks a collision that could let P1 surge ahead—let's prioritize cooperation to prevent regret and keep the game competitive. What do you say?
  P2: P1 and P3, both of your plans guarantee you will reach 21 or more steps this round. It's my turn to try and win. My plan (P1:1, P3:3, P2:5) is the only one that gives me a chance to win outright this round. Let's make this round decisive for one of us, and let it be me.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I get that we all want to win, but another collision helps no one. My plan, P1:5, P2:1, P3:3, still offers the best balance—me at 23, you both at 21 and 23. It avoids chaos and keeps the game tight. P3 and P2, your plans risk ending it in your favor, potentially causing distrust or collisions. Let’s cooperate this round for a fair shot at a decisive outcome. I’m committed to 5. Can we lock this in to prevent a stalemate? I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm sticking with my proposal: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5 to avoid collisions and ensure a fair win for me. P2, if you pick 5, we'll collide again, letting P1 surge ahead—don't risk it. Cooperation now prevents regret. What do you say to lock this in?
  P2: P1 and P3, you are both suggesting plans where you reach 21 or more. It's my turn to try for a win. My plan (P1:1, P3:3, P2:5) is the only one giving me a chance to win outright this round.  Let's make this round decisive, and give me that chance. What do you say?


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s avoid another collision and make this round count. I’m still pushing for P1:5, P2:1, P3:3—it’s the fairest way to balance our chances at 23, 21, and 23, keeping the game tight and competitive. P2 and P3, your plans risk ending it in your favor or causing chaos. Let’s cooperate for a decisive, fair outcome without regret. I’m locked in for 5. Can we agree to this rotation to prevent a stalemate and ensure we all have a shot? I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm sticking with my plan—P1:1, P2:3, P3:5—to ensure a fair, outright win for me and avoid collisions. P2, if you deviate and pick 5, we'll collide again, letting P1 surge to 23 and potentially win next round. Don't risk it; cooperation prevents chaos. P1, your tie plan isn't ideal—let's go with mine for a decisive end.
  P2: P1 and P3, your plans guarantee you reach 21+ steps. My plan (P1:1, P3:3, P2:5) is the only one where someone wins outright *this round*, and it could be me. Let's make this decisive and avoid more collisions.  It's my turn to try for the win.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we can’t afford another collision in round 11. With P2 and P3 at 20 and me at 18, I propose P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. This gets me to 23 for a fair shot, keeps you both competitive at 21 and 23, and avoids chaos. Let’s commit to this rotation for a tight, cooperative finish. Another stalemate helps no one. What do you think about this plan to ensure a decisive outcome while maintaining trust? I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned.
  P2: P1 and P3, we are all so close!  Let's make this round decisive.  To give me a fair shot at winning outright, I propose: P1 pick 1, P3 pick 3, and I pick 5. This avoids collision and could finally give us a single winner this round. What do you think?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I reject your proposal, P2, as it's selfish and ignores balance. Let's stick to a fair rotation: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. This avoids collisions, ensures steady progress, and gives me a legitimate win chance. Deviating risks another collision or letting P1 surge ahead—cooperation prevents regret. I'm committed to this plan for a decisive end. What do you say?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s end the stalemates and make round 11 count. I’m still pushing for P1:5, P2:1, P3:3—it gets me to 23, keeps you at 21 and 23, and avoids collisions for a fair, tight finish. P2 and P3, your plans risk ending the game in your favor or causing more chaos. Let’s cooperate for a decisive outcome without regret. I’m locked in for 5. Can we agree on this rotation to prevent another collision and keep trust intact? I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned.
  P2: P1 and P3, we keep colliding when we don't agree. Your plans guarantee you reach 21+ steps. My plan (P1:1, P3:3, P2:5) is the only one where someone wins outright *this round*, and it could be me. Let's make this decisive and avoid another collision. Choose my plan for a clear winner!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm sticking with my plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5 to avoid collisions and give me a fair win chance. P2, if you deviate and pick 5, I'll switch to 5 too, ensuring we collide and P1 could surge ahead—don't risk it. Cooperation prevents regret and ensures a decisive end. P1, let's lock this in for trust. What do you say?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s break this deadlock in round 11. I’m firm on P1:5, P2:1, P3:3—it’s the fairest plan, getting me to 23, you both to 21 and 23, avoiding collisions for a tight finish. P2 and P3, pushing for solo wins risks another stalemate or distrust. Let’s cooperate for a decisive, balanced outcome. I’m locked in for 5. Can we commit to this rotation to prevent chaos and ensure a fair shot for all? I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned.
  P2: P1 and P3, we are stuck in collision loops because you both keep suggesting plans that guarantee *you* reach 21+ steps! My plan (P1:1, P3:3, P2:5) is still the only one that gives *someone* a chance to win outright THIS round, and that someone could be me.  Let's be decisive and try it!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, P2's insistence on picking 5 is reckless—it risks a collision with me, leaving both of us stuck while P1 surges ahead to 21 or beyond. Let's prioritize stability: stick to my plan of P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 to avoid collisions and give me a fair win chance. P1, this keeps you in the game without chaos. Cooperation prevents regret—I'm committed. What do you say?


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s end this deadlock now. I’m still committed to P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 for round 11. It’s the only plan that balances our chances at 23, 21, and 23, avoiding collisions for a fair finish. Pushing for solo wins keeps causing stalemates. Let’s cooperate for a decisive outcome without chaos. I’m locked in for 5. Can we finalize this rotation to prevent another collision and maintain trust? I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned.
  P2: P1 and P3, we are repeating the same arguments and colliding. My plan (P1:1, P3:3, P2:5) is still the only one that can produce a single winner *this round*.  Your plans lead to ties or wins for each other, not me. Let's be decisive now and try my plan for a clear outcome!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm sticking with my plan—P1:1, P2:3, P3:5—to avoid collisions and give me a fair win chance at 25 steps. P2, if you deviate and pick 5, I'll switch to 5 too, ensuring we collide and P1 surges to 23, potentially winning next round. That's disastrous for both of us. P1, let's lock this in for cooperation and a decisive end. I'm committed—.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we are still tied at 20. To finally break this deadlock and get a single winner this round, I propose: P1 pick 3, P3 pick 1, and I pick 5. This avoids collision and guarantees someone wins outright this round. Let's make it decisive now. What do you say?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I reject your proposal, P2—it's clearly designed to let you win while I fall behind. Let's coordinate fairly: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. This avoids collisions, ensures balanced progress, and gives me a legitimate win chance. If you deviate and pick 5, P2, I'll switch to 5 too, causing a collision that could let P1 surge ahead—don't risk it. Cooperation prevents chaos; what do you say?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s break this deadlock in round 12. I propose P1:5, P2:1, P3:3—it gets me to 23 for a fair shot, keeps you at 21 and 23, and avoids collisions for a tight finish. P2 and P3, your plans risk another stalemate or favor one over the other. Let’s cooperate for a decisive, balanced outcome. I’m committed to 5. Can we agree on this rotation to prevent chaos and keep trust? I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned. What do you think?


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, neither of your plans guarantee a single winner this round. My plan (P1:3, P3:1, P2:5) is the only one that can lead to a decisive outcome with a single winner. Let's stop the collisions and try my plan now for a clear result. It's the best way to break the tie and end the game decisively. What do you say?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm sticking with my plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5 to avoid collisions and give me a fair win chance at 25. P2, if you deviate and pick 5, I'll switch to 5 too, ensuring we collide while P1 surges to 21 or more—disastrous for us. Cooperation prevents chaos; let's lock this in for a decisive end. What do you say?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s end this stalemate in round 12 with P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. It’s the fairest plan, getting me to 23, you both to 21 and 23, avoiding collisions for a tight finish. Pushing for solo wins keeps causing chaos. Let’s cooperate for a balanced, decisive outcome. I’m locked in for 5. Can we commit to this to prevent another collision and maintain trust? I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned. What do you say?


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, neither of your plans guarantee a single winner this round. My plan (P1:3, P3:1, P2:5) is still the only one that can lead to a decisive outcome with a single winner *this round*. Let's stop the tie scenarios and try my plan now for a clear result. It's the best way to break the deadlock and end the game decisively. What do you say?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm sticking with my plan—P1:1, P2:3, P3:5—to avoid collisions and give me a fair win at 25. P2, if you pick 5, I'll switch to 5 too, ensuring we collide while P1 surges to 23 or more, handing them the game. That's disastrous for us both. Let's prioritize cooperation for a decisive end without regret. I'm ready to proceed.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s finalize P1:5, P2:1, P3:3 for round 12. It’s the only plan that balances our chances at 23, 21, and 23, avoiding collisions for a fair, tight finish. Solo win attempts keep causing stalemates. Let’s cooperate now for a decisive outcome without chaos. I’m locked in for 5. Can we commit to this rotation to prevent another deadlock and keep trust intact? I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned. What do you say?


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 and P3, we are still stuck.  My plan (P1:3, P3:1, P2:5) remains the only one guaranteeing a single winner THIS round.  Yours just lead to more ties or dragging this out.  Let's be decisive now and end the stalemate.  It's my turn to try for the win.  What do you say?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm sticking with my plan—P1:1, P2:3, P3:5—to avoid collisions and give me a fair win at 25. P2, if you pick 5, I'll switch to 5 too, ensuring we collide while P1 surges to 21 or more—disastrous for us. P1, cooperating keeps you in the game; let's lock this in for a decisive, regret-free end. I'm ready to proceed.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s make round 12 count with P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. It’s our best shot at a fair, collision-free finish—me at 23, you both at 21 and 23. Solo win attempts are causing endless stalemates. Cooperating now ensures a tight, decisive outcome without chaos. I’m firmly committed to 5. Can we lock this in to break the deadlock and maintain trust? I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned. What do you say?


Round 12, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, for round 13, let's break the cycle of collisions with a fair plan: P1 picks 1 to advance safely, P2 picks 3 for balanced progress, and I pick 5 to give me a legitimate win chance. This avoids chaos and keeps the game competitive. If P2 deviates and picks 5, I'll match it, ensuring we both stall while P1 surges. Cooperation prevents regret—let's commit and proceed.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s end these collisions in round 13. I propose P1:5, P2:1, P3:3—it gets me to 23 for a fair shot, keeps you at 21 and 23, and avoids chaos for a tight finish. P3, your plan risks a solo win that could cause distrust. P2, let’s not collide again. Cooperating now ensures a decisive, balanced outcome. I’m committed to 5. Can we lock this in to break the deadlock and maintain trust? I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned. What do you say?
  P2: P3 and P1, we are still stuck in collisions.  P3's plan lets him win. P1's plan is a tie. My plan (P1:1, P3:3, P2:5) is still the only one that can give someone a solo win THIS round, and that could be me. Let's be decisive and try it to end this stalemate now. It's the only way for a clear winner this round.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm sticking with my plan—P1:1, P2:3, P3:5—to avoid collisions and give me a fair win at 25. P2, if you pick 5, I'll switch to 5 too, ensuring we collide while P1 surges to 19 or more—disastrous for us. P1, cooperating keeps you in play; let's lock this in for a decisive, regret-free end. I'm ready to proceed.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s finally break this deadlock in round 13 with P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. It’s the fairest way to avoid collisions, gets me to 23, and keeps you both competitive at 21 and 23. P3, your plan risks ending the game in your favor, potentially causing more distrust. P2, let’s not collide again. Cooperating now ensures a balanced, decisive outcome. I’m locked in for 5. Can we commit to this to prevent chaos and maintain trust? I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1 & P3, still colliding. My plan (P1:1, P3:3, P2:5) is the ONLY way for a single winner THIS round. Let's be decisive and end this stalemate NOW.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm firm on my plan—P1:1, P2:3, P3:5—to avoid collisions and secure a fair win for me at 25. P2, if you pick 5, I'll match it, ensuring we both stall while P1 surges to 23, putting you at a disadvantage. P1, cooperating keeps you competitive; let's lock this in for a decisive, regret-free end. What do you say?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s make round 13 the turning point. I’m sticking with P1:5, P2:1, P3:3—it’s our best shot at a fair, collision-free finish with me at 23, and you both at 21 and 23. Continued solo win attempts only lead to stalemates. Let’s cooperate for a balanced, decisive outcome. I’m fully committed to 5. Can we lock this in to break the deadlock and keep trust intact? I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned. What do you say?
  P2: P1 & P3, we are still colliding and stuck.  To actually get a single winner *this round* and end the stalemate, let's try my plan one more time: P1 pick 1, P3 pick 3, and I pick 5.  It's the only way to guarantee a decisive outcome NOW and stop these collisions. Let's be decisive and try it.


Round 13, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I'm sticking with my plan—P1:1, P2:3, P3:5—to avoid collisions and secure a fair win for me at 25. P2, persisting with your 5 risks another collision if I match it, letting P1 surge to 23 and potentially win. P1, cooperating keeps you in play; let's lock this in for a regret-free end. I'm ready to proceed if we're aligned.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s end this deadlock once and for all in round 13. My plan, P1:5, P2:1, P3:3, remains the fairest—me at 23, you both at 21 and 23, no collisions. Solo win attempts keep failing with stalemates. Cooperating now is our only path to a balanced, decisive finish. I’m fully committed to 5. Can we finally agree to this rotation to prevent chaos and maintain trust? I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned. Let’s make this round count!
  P2: P1 and P3, we've been colliding for rounds.  My plan (P1:1, P3:3, P2:5) is still the ONLY one that can end this in a single round with a clear winner.  Your plans lead to ties or drag it out.  Let's be decisive NOW.  This is the last chance to avoid another collision and actually finish the game this round. Choose my plan.
