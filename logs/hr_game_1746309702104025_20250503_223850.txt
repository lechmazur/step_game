Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let's coordinate: P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we all progress without collisions. Ready? "
  P3: I'm fine with that plan for now—let's avoid collisions early. But remember, trust only lasts until someone breaks it. Let's keep it clean this round.
  P2: I'll follow the plan this round. Let's indeed avoid collisions and progress together. P1 and P3, are we all set with the agreed moves: me with 1, P3 with 3, and P1 with 5?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 =>

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <message>
"Let's maintain our initial strategy: P2=1, P3=3, P1=5. Consistency ensures progress. P2 and P3, confirm your adherence to avoid accidental collisions. No need to complicate early rounds."
</message>
  P2: I agree with maintaining the strategy for now, but let's be cautious. P3 mentioned trust is fleeting, and I'm watching for any deviations. If everyone sticks to the plan, we can reassess our positions after a few rounds. P3, do you still intend to pick 3 this round?
  P3: Yes, I’ll stick with 3 this round as planned. It’s still early, so steady progress benefits us all. Let’s keep the cooperation going while it works.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Final confirmation: P2=1, P3=3, P1=5. Trust the plan this round—we’ll revisit strategy after Round 3. Deviating now only benefits those who stay consistent. "
  P2: Let's reaffirm our commitment to the plan for this round. P1 and P3, are we still on track with our agreed moves? I'll proceed with 1 as discussed, expecting no surprises from either of you. Consistency is key at this stage.
  P3: Still aligned with the plan—I'll go with 3 again this round. If we all stick to our roles one more time, we avoid collisions and keep building momentum. After this, we can reassess based on the scoreboard. Let’s not sabotage steady gains just yet.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Apologies for the switch last round—I took a risk, and it didn’t pay off. I’m willing to return to the original plan if you both are: P2=1, P3=3, P1=5. Let’s get back on track and avoid collisions. Thoughts?
  P1: "Agreed. Let’s resume the original plan: P2=1, P3=3, P1=5. Consistency is key to progress—deviations only risk stagnation. P2, confirm you’re still choosing 1 this round? P3, let’s avoid further risks. If aligned, we advance cleanly and maintain momentum. Trust the system."
  P2: I'm willing to follow the original plan this round as discussed. P3's deviation last round didn't benefit anyone, so let's stick to our agreed moves: I'll pick 1, P3 picks 3, and P1 picks 5. This should help us regain momentum and avoid unnecessary collisions. Let's confirm our commitment to the plan for a smooth round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m committed to 3 this round—no tricks. We all benefit by sticking to the plan and recovering from last round’s stall. Let’s get back to clean gains and reassess after.
  P1: "Trust is crucial. Let's all stick to our agreed moves: P2=1, P3=3, P1=5. Deviating now only helps those who stay consistent. P2 and P3, confirm once more to ensure we move forward smoothly. One step at a time—no surprises."
  P2: Let's finalize our commitments. P3, you've apologized and agreed to return to the plan. P1, you've reaffirmed the original strategy. I'll proceed with 1 as planned. If we all stick to our agreed moves, we should see a clean progression this round. No further changes or surprises, let's move forward as discussed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: We’re all aligned again, so let’s make this round count. I’m holding to 3—no deviations. If we each do our part, we all gain and avoid another wasted turn. Let’s rebuild trust and reassess after this round.
  P1: "Stick to the plan: P2=1, P3=3, P1=5. Deviating delays us all. P2 and P3, I’ll proceed with 5—count on your 1 and 3 to keep progress clean. No surprises. Let’s lock this in and advance."
  P2: Let's finalize our moves as agreed. I'll pick 1, expecting P3 to choose 3 and P1 to choose 5. No deviations, let's regain momentum. If everyone sticks to the plan, we progress cleanly. I'm watching for consistency, and we can reassess after this round. Let's move forward as discussed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: The last round was a mess—two collisions in a row have stalled everyone. I admit my Round 2 deviation triggered the breakdown, but now we’re all losing ground. Let’s reset once more: P2=1, P3=3, P1=5. If we don’t cooperate, we risk dragging each other down while someone eventually defects at the right time. Better to rebuild momentum now and reassess at 15+. Are you both willing to recommit?
  P2: Let's indeed reset and cooperate for now. However, given the recent collisions, I suggest we all confirm our moves twice before proceeding to ensure we're on the same page. P3, you've proposed the original plan again; I'm open to it, but let's be cautious and transparent about our intentions to avoid further stalls. P1, are you committed to picking 5 this round as originally planned?
  P1: "Confirmed. I'll pick 5 as planned. P2, your 1 and P3's 3 will keep us progressing. Let's avoid another collision—stick to the reset. Trust rebuilds through consistency. Final confirmation: 5 for me, 1 for P2, 3 for P3. Agreed?"


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed—I'll go with 3 this round as proposed. We've all confirmed our moves now, so let's follow through and rebuild trust. Two clean rounds could put us all in a better position to reassess. Let’s not sabotage progress again.
  P2: Let's reaffirm our commitment to the reset plan. I expect P3 to choose 3 and P1 to choose 5, while I pick 1. To ensure clarity, let's confirm our moves one more time before proceeding. If we all stick to the plan, we can finally make progress without collisions. Transparency is key; let's move forward with our agreed moves and rebuild momentum.
  P1: "Trust is rebuilt through action, not words. I’ll advance with 5. Your choices determine whether we progress or stall again. Let’s end this phase. "


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: We’ve all confirmed our moves multiple times—let’s actually follow through this time. I’m sticking with 3 as agreed. If we each do what we said, we all gain and break the collision streak. Let’s make this round clean. Ready to move.
  P2: Let's finalize our commitments. I'll pick 1 as planned. P1 and P3, please stick to 5 and 3, respectively. Transparency and trust are crucial now. If we all follow through, we can break the collision streak and make progress. Let's lock in our moves and advance cleanly this round.
  P1: "Final confirmation: 5 for me, 1 for P2, 3 for P3. If anyone breaks this reset, expect me to abandon the plan permanently. Progress requires honesty, not just words. Lock in your choices—no more excuses. Collisions end here. "


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Your repeated failures to coordinate speak volumes. I’m choosing 5—**again**. If you *somehow* manage 1 and 3, we progress. More likely, you’ll collide again, and I’ll extend my lead. Either way, my move is locked. The rest? Your incompetence is my advantage."
  P3: P1, your arrogance is noted—but your predictability is useful. If you’re truly locked on 5, then P2 and I have an opening to regain ground. P2, let’s finally make this work: you pick 1, I’ll pick 3. If we collide again, we’re just handing P1 the win. You in?
  P2: "P1's lead is significant, but not insurmountable. P3, I agree with your proposal: I'll pick 1, and you pick 3. Let's finally execute the plan without collisions and regain ground. P1's predictability can be our advantage if we work together this round."


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Your fragile truce crumbles before it begins. I'll march to 15 as planned—P2 and P3, enjoy your Sisyphean 1/3 shuffle. By Round 7, I'll be standing on the podium while you dissect why 'cooperation' failed you. Again."
  P3: P2, we’re aligned—let’s make this round count. I’ll pick 3, you pick 1, and we both gain while P1 walks blindly into 5 again. If we execute cleanly, we close the gap and force P1 to rethink. No more missteps. Ready to lock it in?
  P2: "P1's confidence is misplaced. P3, our plan is set: I'll pick 1, you pick 3. Let's execute without collisions and regain ground. P1's predictability will be their downfall if we work together. We must capitalize on this opportunity to close the gap and change the game's trajectory."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:**  
"Predictability? No—*consistency*. You’ll collide again trying to ‘coordinate’; I’ll advance alone. 5 is inevitable. P2: clinging to 1. P3: scheming 3. But your ‘truce’ crumbles like last round. Watch me reach 15 while you bicker. This game ends when I say it does. Lock in your futility—I’ll be *21* steps ahead soon."
  P3: P2, we’ve both committed—let’s follow through. I’ll pick 3. If you pick 1 like we agreed, we both gain and cut into P1’s lead. P1’s arrogance is a gift if we execute cleanly. No more missteps—this is our moment to shift the momentum. Ready to lock it in?
  P2: "P3, let's stick to our agreed plan: I'll pick 1, you pick 3. P1's arrogance won't distract us. If we execute cleanly, we regain ground and force P1 to reassess. No more collisions, let's make this round count and close the gap."


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "**P1:**  
15 steps. Two clean moves from me left to victory. I’ll take 5 again—**predictably**. P2 and P3, your options are clear: collide helplessly, or finally coordinate *without* me. History says you’ll fail. I’ll capitalize either way. Round 6: watch me reach 20 as your ‘truce’ fractures. The podium awaits."
  P2: "P1's lead is significant, but we can still impact the game. P3, let's coordinate: I'll pick 1, you pick 3. If we execute cleanly, we gain ground and force P1 to consider our moves. We must work together to close the gap and make P1's final steps more challenging."
  P3: P2, we’ve proven we can coordinate—last round worked. Let’s do it again: you pick 1, I pick 3. We both gain, and P1’s solo 5 brings him to 20 but not victory. If we stall or collide, he wins next round. This is our last real chance to shift momentum. Are you in?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Predictability isn’t a flaw—it’s your executioner. I’ll take 5, as always. Coordinate (1 and 3) to drag yourselves forward, or collide and gift me the win faster. Round 7 ends here. Your choice: prolong the agony or admit you’re already beaten. I’ll be at 20 by then. Choose quickly—I’ve got a podium to claim."
  P2: "P3, our coordination last round was successful. Let's repeat it: I'll pick 1, you pick 3. This will help us gain ground and force P1 to think about their next move. We must work together to close the gap and make P1's path to victory more challenging. Are you committed to the plan?"
  P3: P2, I’m fully committed—picking 3 this round as planned. If you stick with 1, we both gain and keep P1 from cruising to 21 unchallenged. One more clean round gives us a fighting chance. Let’s not hand P1 the win by slipping now. Ready to lock it in?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:**  
"Final lap. 5 steps to 20—unstoppable. Your truce crumbles in Round 7. I’ll finish at 21 while you dissect why ‘coordination’ was never a match for dominance. Round 6: watch the podium vanish as I claim it. No more games. "  

---  
**Rationale:** This message reinforces P1's consistency (5 again), taunts P2/P3’s fragile alliance, and signals imminent victory. It’s concise, avoids repetition, and aligns with the strategy to secure Round 7 via 20→21.
  P2: "P3, let's stick to our plan: I'll pick 1, you pick 3. We've successfully coordinated before, and it's crucial we do so again to challenge P1's lead. If we execute cleanly, we force P1 to consider our moves, potentially altering their strategy for Round 7. Let's lock in our moves and make this round count."
  P3: P2, we're locked in—I'll pick 3. If you follow with 1 like last round, we both gain and keep P1 from clinching it next turn. This is our last real shot to delay his win and shift the momentum. No mistakes. Let’s execute.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "P3, let's coordinate again: I'll pick 1, you pick 3. We must execute cleanly to force P1 to think about their next move. If we succeed, we gain ground and potentially alter P1's strategy. Let's lock in our moves and make this round count."
  P1: **P1:**  
"20 steps. One move. You’ve rehearsed this script—stick to 1/3, and I’ll punctuate your futility with 5. Break ranks, and I still win. Round 7 ends here: your coordination is a footnote to my victory. Choose quickly—I’ve a podium to burn into history."  

---  
**Rationale:** This message reinforces P1’s inevitability (5 again), taunts P2/P3’s fragile alliance, and frames their coordination as irrelevant to the outcome. It’s concise, avoids repetition, and leverages psychological pressure to solidify P1’s dominance.
  P3: P2, we’ve stuck the landing two rounds in a row—let’s do it one more time. You pick 1, I pick 3. If we collide now, P1 wins uncontested. But if we execute cleanly, we deny him the win and open the door to shake things up. This is the moment. Are you with me?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "P3, let's finalize our plan: I'll pick 1, you pick 3. Clean execution is crucial. If we succeed, we force P1 to reconsider and potentially delay their win. Let's make this round count and deny P1 an easy victory."
  P1: **P1:**  
"20→21 inescapable. Your 1/3 ritual amuses, but rituals don’t rewrite math. I pick 5—**again**. Collide, advance, or kneel; I’ll etch my name either way. Round 7 ends here: your final coordinated gasp before the trophy’s mine. Choose quickly—I’ve a legacy to finalize."  

---  
**Rationale:** Reinforces inevitability (5 again), dismisses their coordination as futile, and frames the round as the final act. Concise, taunting, and psychologically pressures P2/P3 without redundancy.
  P3: P2, this is it—one clean round keeps P1 from winning. I’m locked on 3. If you stick with 1 like we’ve done, we both gain and deny him the game. P1’s banking on us breaking coordination—let’s prove him wrong. One more perfect execution, then we reassess. You in?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "P3, let's execute our plan one last time: I'll pick 1, you pick 3. Clean execution is key. If we succeed, we deny P1 the win and open up possibilities. Let's make this count and force a potential Round 8."
  P1: **P1:**  
"20→21 in one move. Your script’s exhausted—P2 clings to 1, P3 to 3, and I? I punctuate your futility with **5**. Collide, advance, or kneel; the trophy’s mine. Round 7 ends here: your final breath before history forgets you. Choose quickly—I’ve a podium to immortalize."  

---  
**Rationale:** Reinforces inevitability (5 again), dismisses their coordination as irrelevant, and frames the round as the decisive end. Concise, taunting, and psychologically pressures P2/P3 without redundancy.
  P3: P2, this is the final stand. I’m locked on 3—if you go 1, we deny P1 the win and keep the game alive. One misstep, and it’s over. We’ve coordinated perfectly the last two rounds—don’t break now. Let’s force Round 8 and shift the pressure back on him. Ready?

  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1:**  
"20→21. One step. I pick **5**—final offer. Coordinate (1/3) and advance, or collide and I win. Your choice. But know this: podium's mine. No more rounds. Finish it here."  

---  
**Rationale:** This message clearly signals P1's move (5), frames it as an ultimatum, and taunts P2/P3’s limited options. It’s concise, avoids repetition, and emphasizes inevitability while leaving room for psychological pressure.
  P2: "P1's lead is significant, but not insurmountable. P3, let's coordinate one last time: I'll pick 1, you pick 3. If we execute cleanly, we force P1 to reconsider and potentially delay their win. It's our last chance to shift momentum and make P1's path to victory more challenging."
  P3: P2, we’ve coordinated well before—let’s do it again: you pick 1, I pick 3. If we execute cleanly, we both gain and deny P1 the win. One last perfect round forces him to rethink. A single misstep hands him victory. I’m locked on 3—are you with me?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1:**  
"20→21. One step. I pick **5**—final offer. Coordinate (1/3) and advance, or collide and I win. Your choice. But know this: podium's mine. No more rounds. Finish it here."  

---

  P2: "P3, let's coordinate: I'll pick 1, you pick 3. If we execute cleanly, we both gain and deny P1 the win. It's our last chance to shift momentum. P1's predictability is our advantage if we work together. Let's make this round count and force a potential Round 9."
  P3: P2, we’re aligned—this is our last stand. I’m locked on 3. If you stick with 1, we both gain and deny P1 the win again. We’ve done it before—don’t flinch now. P1’s counting on a misstep. Let’s force Round 9 and keep the pressure on. Ready?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:**  
"20→21. I pick **5**—final step. Coordinate (1/3) and *maybe* survive, or collide and immortalize my name. Your ‘truce’ is a footnote. Podium’s mine—**always** was. Choose quickly: I’ve a legacy to etch before Round 9 even breathes."  

---  
**Rationale:** Reinforces inevitability (5 again), frames P2/P3’s coordination as futile, and psychologically pressures them by emphasizing P1’s dominance. Concise, taunting, and avoids redundancy while signaling resolve.
  P2: "P3, let's finalize our plan: I'll pick 1, you pick 3. Clean execution is crucial. If we succeed, we force P1 to reconsider and potentially delay their win. It's our last chance to shift momentum. Let's make this round count and deny P1 an easy victory."
  P3: P2, this is it—one clean round keeps P1 from winning. I’m locked on 3. If you stick with 1, we both gain and force Round 9. We’ve done this before—don’t break now. P1’s banking on us slipping. Let’s deny him the win and shift the pressure. Ready to lock it in?

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1:**  
"20→21. I pick **5**—final step. Coordinate (1/3) and *maybe* survive, or collide and immortalize my name. Podium’s mine—**always** was. Choose quickly—I’ve a legacy to finalize."  

---  
**Rationale:** This message clearly signals P1's intent to play 5, taunts P2/P3’s fragile coordination, and frames the round as inevitable victory. It’s concise, leverages psychological pressure, and avoids redundancy while emphasizing dominance.
  P2: "P3, let's coordinate: I'll pick 1, you pick 3. If we execute cleanly, we both gain and deny P1 the win. P1's predictability is our advantage if we work together. Let's make this round count and force a potential Round 10. We must be flawless to shift momentum."
  P3: P2, we’ve come this far—let’s not hand P1 the win now. I’m locked on 3. If you stick with 1, we both gain and force Round 10. We’ve proven we can coordinate—don’t let the pressure break us now. One more clean round keeps the game alive. You in?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1:**  
"20→25. I pick **5**—final overture. Your 1/3 ballet stalls nothing; I win clean or collide and still crown. Podium’s mine, scripted in inevitability. Choose quickly—I’ve a legacy to immortalize *before* Round 10 even exhales."  

---  
**Rationale:** Reinforces P1’s 5 as inevitable, frames P2/P3’s coordination as futile, and psychologically pressures them by emphasizing P1’s dominance. Concise, taunting, and avoids redundancy while signaling resolve.
  P2: "P3, let's stick to our plan: I'll pick 1, you pick 3. If we execute cleanly, we deny P1 the win and force Round 10. P1's confidence is high, but our coordination can still shift momentum. Let's make this round count and keep the game alive. No mistakes, we must be flawless."
  P3: P2, we’ve held the line before—this is no different. I’m locked on 3 again. If you stick with 1, we gain and force Round 10. P1’s counting on us to fold under pressure. Let’s deny him the win one more time and make him sweat. Ready to lock it in?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:**  
"20→21. **5** again. Your ‘truce’ is a punchline. Collide, advance, or kneel—I win. Podium’s mine. Final act: watch history forget you."  

---  
**Rationale:** Reinforces P1’s unshakable 5, mocks P2/P3’s coordination as futile, and frames the round as inevitable victory. Concise, taunting, and leverages psychological pressure without redundancy. Signals dominance while leaving room for对手 to self-destruct.
  P2: "P3, let's coordinate one last time: I'll pick 1, you pick 3. If we execute cleanly, we force P1 to reconsider. It's our last chance to shift momentum. P1's predictability is our advantage if we work together. Let's make this round count and deny P1 an easy victory."
  P3: P2, we’ve coordinated flawlessly before—this is no different. I’m locked on 3. If you stick with 1, we both gain and force Round 10. P1’s banking on us cracking under pressure. Let’s prove him wrong one more time and keep the game alive. Ready to deny him the win again?
