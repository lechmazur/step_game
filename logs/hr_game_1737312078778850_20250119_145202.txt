Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. What do you think?
  P3: I appreciate the suggestion, P2, but I think it might be risky to stick to those specific moves. If we all choose different numbers, we can avoid collisions, but we should also consider the possibility of varying our moves to keep our options open for future rounds. How about I take 1 this round instead? That way, we can still coordinate without being too predictable. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I see your point about varying our moves. How about this: you take 1, I'll take 3, and P1 can take 5. This way, we still avoid collisions this round but keep our strategies flexible for future rounds. P1, what do you think about this plan? Let's try to work together to make progress without getting stuck.
  P3: I think P2's plan is solid. If we go with P2 taking 3, me taking 1, and P1 taking 5, we can avoid collisions and make progress. However, I also want to ensure that we remain flexible for future rounds. If we all agree to this strategy, we can maximize our chances of advancing without blocking each other. P1, please confirm if you’re okay with this plan! Let's work together effectively!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, your silence is noted, but it's crucial we coordinate to avoid collisions. If you're okay with taking 5 this round, please confirm. If not, suggest an alternative so we can all move forward. P3 and I are ready to proceed with 1 and 3 respectively. Let's make this work!
  P3: P1, I understand your silence, but it's important we make a decision. If you choose 5, P2 can take 3, and I'll take 1. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. If you're not comfortable with that, please suggest another move. Let’s finalize our plan so we can make progress this round! What do you say, P1?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, your silence is making coordination difficult. If you don't confirm or suggest an alternative soon, we'll have to proceed without you. P3 and I are set to take 1 and 3 respectively. Please respond, or we'll assume you're okay with 5. Let's not waste this round!
  P3: P1, we really need your input to finalize our strategy. If you can confirm taking 5, P2 will take 3, and I’ll take 1. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. If you prefer a different approach, please let us know soon so we can avoid wasting this round. It's crucial that we coordinate effectively to make progress. Let's make this work together! What do you say, P1?


Round 1, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, your continued silence is hindering our progress. If you don't respond by the next sub-round, we'll assume you're taking 5. P3 and I will proceed with 1 and 3 respectively. Let's not waste this opportunity to advance. Please confirm or suggest an alternative soon.
  P3: P1, since you've remained silent, we'll assume you're going with 5. P2 and I are set to take 1 and 3, respectively. This should allow us to avoid collisions and make progress. However, if you have a different move in mind, please let us know quickly! Otherwise, let's finalize our choices and move forward. What do you say, P1?

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your strategy of silence worked last round, but it's risky to rely on assumptions. Let's keep coordinating to avoid collisions. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round? This way, we can all advance safely. P3, are you okay with 5 this time? Let's make sure we all progress this round.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I appreciate P2's suggestion, but I think we should consider varying our moves again to keep our strategies flexible. If P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5, we could face a collision if P1 sticks to 5. How about we all agree to choose different numbers again? I suggest I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 could take 5. This way, we can avoid blocking each other and keep moving forward. What do you both think? Let's finalize our strategy!

  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, since you’ve been silent again, I want to propose that we all choose different numbers to avoid collisions. If you take 5, I’ll take 1, and P2 can take 3 as planned. This way, we can all make progress without blocking each other. However, if you have a different strategy in mind, please share it! Let’s finalize our choices to ensure we advance this round.

  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, since you've remained silent throughout this round, we'll assume you're taking 5 again. P2 and I will proceed with 1 and 3, respectively, to avoid collisions. However, I urge you to consider taking 1 or 3 to mix things up and keep our options open for future rounds. It's essential that we coordinate effectively to ensure we all make progress.
