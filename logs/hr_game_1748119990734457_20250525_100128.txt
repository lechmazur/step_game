Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey everyone! Since we're all starting fresh, what if we coordinate to avoid collisions this first round? I'm thinking we could each pick different numbers - maybe P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5? That way we all advance and can reassess from there. Thoughts?
  P3: P3: Sounds fair! I'll take 5 to give everyone space. Let’s stick to P1’s plan—1, 3, 5 respectively. This avoids collisions and lets us progress safely. Next round, we can adjust if needed.
  P2: Agreed, I'll take 3 this round to avoid collisions. It's a smart start for all of us. We should discuss adjustments for future rounds to keep things fair and prevent anyone from pulling too far ahead. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Perfect! Sounds like we have a solid plan - P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Let's execute it and see how the game develops from there.
  P3: <move>5</move> is key for me to lead early. Let’s hold firm on the initial plan: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. No surprises—this guarantees progress for all. Next round we can strategize adjustments, but today’s move is non-negotiable. Anyone deviating risks collision and stagnation. Stick to the agreement.
  P2: I'm sticking to the plan for this round: I'll take 3 to avoid collisions and ensure we all progress. For future rounds, to keep it fair and prevent anyone from dominating, let's consider rotating who gets the big moves—maybe P3 takes 5 now, I take 5 next, and P1 after that. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I like P2's rotation idea for future rounds - it's much fairer than having the same person always get the highest move. P3, you'd still get your 5 this round to "lead early" as you want, but then we rotate so everyone gets a turn at the big numbers. Otherwise this current plan puts me way behind from the start. Are you open to committing to that rotation system for rounds 2 and beyond?
  P3: P3: I agree to the rotation for future rounds, but let’s prioritize执行 this round’s plan without deviation—P1→1, P2→3, P3→5—to secure our initial progress. Fairness later depends on trust now. Once we confirm this round’s moves, we can formalize the rotation system for Round 2 onward. No sense sabotaging our start over future uncertainty.
  P2: I'm committed to choosing 3 this round as agreed, ensuring no collisions and steady progress for all. The rotation idea sounds fair—P3 first with 5, then me, then P1—to keep things balanced. Let's move forward and refine it after this turn.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1's betrayal last round caused unnecessary collisions and stalled progress. To restore fairness and stick to our rotation, I propose P2 takes 5 this round (as agreed for me), P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1 to demonstrate trustworthiness. This lets us all advance without issues. P3, are you on board? P1, can we count on you this time? Let's move forward cooperatively.
  P3: P3: Trust is critical now. I commit to the proposed rotation: P2→5, P3→3, P1→1 this round. P1, your prior betrayal cost us progress—collisions hurt everyone. Let’s enforce accountability: if you deviate again, I’ll prioritize blocking you over cooperation. For now, let’s execute this plan flawlessly. Results speak louder than words—prove your reliability.
  P1: Look, I get that you're both upset about last round. But let's be realistic - if I take 1 this round while P2 gets 5, I'll be at 1 step while P2 is at 8. That's an insurmountable lead this early in the game. 

How about we modify the plan: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 5 this round? That puts me at 5, P2 at 6, P3 at 1 - much more balanced. Then we can continue the rotation from there. Otherwise, you're asking me to essentially forfeit the game while P2 runs away with it.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: API Error: Status 400
  P3: P3: Trust is non-negotiable. We agreed to rotate starting with me taking 5 first. This round P2 gets 5 fairly, I take 3, and P1 must take 1. If you refuse, I’ll preemptively take 5 again to block your path. Let’s respect the system we built—collisions only hurt all of us. P1: prove your reliability now, or face consequences.
  P1: Fine, I understand your positions. P3, you're threatening to take 5 if I don't comply, and P2, you want 5 for your rotation turn. I can see this is non-negotiable for both of you. 

I guess I have no choice but to accept taking 1 this round, even though it puts me at a severe disadvantage. Just remember that fair cooperation works both ways - if I'm always getting the scraps while others race ahead, that cooperation won't last long.

Let's proceed with your plan then.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm glad P1 has agreed to the plan despite concerns. Let's stick to it: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. This ensures progress and rebuilds trust. After this round, we can discuss balancing for future turns. I'm committed—let's execute and move on.
  P3: P3: Trust is non-negotiable. We agreed: P2→5, P3→3, P1→1. Deviation triggers preemptive blocking. P1, prove your reliability—your move will be watched closely. Execute flawlessly now; balance discussions come *after* this round. Prioritizing fairness requires discipline. Let’s proceed.
  P1: I've reluctantly agreed to take 1, but let me be crystal clear - this "cooperation" where I'm always getting the worst deal while others advance isn't sustainable. After this round, the rotation better actually rotate fairly to me, or I'll have no choice but to disrupt your coordination since you'll have made it impossible for me to win through cooperation.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Look, I know you're both frustrated with me, but let's look at the scoreboard - we're all within 2 steps of each other! This is actually a competitive game now instead of one person running away with it. 

P2 and P3, if you both gang up on me constantly, one of you will just hand the other the victory. Maybe it's time to think about your own positions rather than just focusing on blocking me. The game is far from over.
  P2: API Error: Status 400
  P3: P3: Let’s enforce the rotation: P1 takes 5 this round (as scheduled). I’ll choose 3 to advance, while P2 takes 1 to reset trust. Deviation triggers collision—my priority is blocking you if you betray again. Cooperation ensures progress for all. Final warning.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I appreciate you offering me the 5 this round according to the rotation. That would put me at 10 steps, which is a solid position. 

I'm willing to take the 5 as you suggest, but honestly, after two rounds of chaos, I'm a bit nervous this might be a setup to block me. If you're genuinely committed to giving me this turn with 5, then I'll take it and we can continue the rotation fairly.

P2, are you okay with taking 1 this round as P3 suggested? The scores would be P1 at 10, P3 at 6, P2 at 5 - still very competitive.
  P2: P1, given the mutual betrayals, trust is shot. I'm not okay with taking 1 again—it keeps me behind. Let's adjust for balance: I take 5, you take 3, P3 takes 1. Scores would be P2:9, P1:8, P3:4—fair and competitive. P3, can we make this work instead of strict rotation? Cooperation needs equity.
  P3: P3: The rotation system is non-negotiable to preserve fairness. P1’s turn to take 5 this round (per agreed sequence: P3→P2→P1). I’ll take 3 to advance, while P2 must take 1 to rebuild trust. Deviations will be met with collision—your move, P2. Stick to the plan or face consequences. Progress depends on discipline.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I appreciate you sticking to the rotation and offering me the 5. You've been more consistent with agreements than P2 has been. 

P2, I understand you don't want to fall behind, but you already broke the rotation once. If we abandon the system now, it's just going to be chaos every round with everyone grabbing for 5.

I'm inclined to trust P3's commitment to the rotation this round, but honestly, after all the betrayals, I'm prepared for anything. Let's see who actually follows through.
  P2: API Error: Status 400
  P3: P3: The rotation system is our only path to fairness. P1 takes 5 this round as scheduled—**no exceptions**. I’ll take 3 to advance, while P2 must take 1 to rebuild trust. Deviations trigger collision: I’ll preemptively grab 5 if either of you betray. P2, your prior breakdown caused chaos—prove reliability now. P1, I’ve honored the agreement—stick to it. Discipline ensures progress. Execute the plan or face consequences.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, the scoreboard tells the real story - P2 and I are dead even at 5 steps each, while P3 is at 3. 

P3, you're behind now and need to think strategically. Do you really want to keep enforcing a rotation that helps P2 and me equally? Maybe it's time to consider which one of us you'd rather see win, because this tie isn't going to last forever.

P2, looks like our mutual betrayals have created an interesting situation. We're neck and neck now.
  P2: API Error: Status 400
  P3: P3: The rotation sequence clearly places my turn for 5 this round after P1’s failed commitment last time. I’ll take 5 to close my deficit—P1 and P2 must pick 1 and 3. Collusion between you risks mutual collision. Cooperate to advance, or face stagnation. My priority is non-negotiable.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you're asking P2 and me to hand you the lead while we're tied for second place. That doesn't make strategic sense for either of us. 

P2, we've been so focused on blocking each other that P3 is about to leapfrog us both. Maybe it's time we stop letting the player in last place dictate terms. If P3 takes 5 and reaches 8, while we settle for 6-8, they could easily win from there.

What do you think about prioritizing our own advancement instead of following P3's "rotation" demands?
  P2: API Error: Status 400
  P3: P3: The rotation sequence explicitly prioritizes my 5 this round to address prior breaches. P1 and P2 must choose 1 and 3 to avoid mutual collision. My move is non-negotiable—collusion to block me risks stagnation for all. Cooperate to advance or face consequences. I take 5; your choices are clear.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your threats are empty - you can't force both P2 and me to comply. If you try to "collision" with either of us, you hurt yourself too and stay in last place.

P2, think about this: P3 wants us to hand them the lead while we're tied. That's terrible strategy for both of us. Why should the player in last place suddenly jump ahead? We should focus on our own advancement, not enabling P3's comeback.

I'm not following P3's rotation demands anymore.
  P2: P1, we're tied and P3 is behind—time to focus on our own game. I'm proposing we coordinate: I'll take 3, you take 5, avoiding collision and advancing us both. P3, insisting on 5 might leave you stalled. Let's prioritize progress over outdated rotations.
  P3: P3: The rotation system is **non-negotiable**—my turn for 5 this round to close the gap. P1 and P2: colluding to block me ensures *mutual collision* if both grab 3/5. Cooperate (1/3) or face stagnation. My priority is advancement, not charity. The rules we agreed to protect *all* of us—break them, and I’ll enforce consequences. Choose wisely.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, we’re tied—colliding on 5 means neither advances. Let’s split: I take **5** (→13), you take **3** (→11). P1, take **1** (→7). This avoids mutual sabotage. Deviations will be met with preemptive collision. Trust the plan to progress, or risk stagnation.
  P1: P2, think about what P3 is really proposing - they jump from tied with you at 8 to a commanding lead at 13, while you only reach 11. You're handing them a 2-step advantage over you!

We're both behind P3's proposal. Why not coordinate between us instead? If you take 5 (→13) and I take 3 (→9), we advance without letting the player who's been demanding special treatment all game suddenly leap ahead. P3 can take 1.

You and P3 are tied - this is your competition now, not mine.
  P2: P1, I see your point—P3's demands are unfair and give them an edge. I'm inclined to coordinate with you: I'll take 5 to reach 13, you take 3 to 9, and P3 takes 1. This avoids P3 pulling ahead unchallenged. P3, if you insist on 5, we'll collide and stall, helping P1 and me. Let's discuss for mutual benefit.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: The rotation sequence dictates my turn for 5 this round. I’ll claim **5** (→13). P2 must take **3** (→11) and P1 **1** (→7). Collusion to block me risks mutual collision—your choice. Cooperate to advance, or stagnate. This is **non-negotiable**.
  P1: P3, I actually respect that you're standing firm on your rotation principle. You've been consistent about it all game. 

P2, if you both insist on taking 5, you'll just collide and neither of you advance. That seems like a waste. Maybe one of you should reconsider? 

I'm fine taking whatever number avoids collisions - whether that's 1 or 3. I just want to see some progress this round instead of more stalemates.
  P2: P3, your insistence on taking 5 risks a collision that stalls both of us, giving P1 an easy path to catch up. P1, I'm committed to our coordination: I'll take 5 to reach 13, you take 3 to 9. This avoids waste and keeps us competitive. If you deviate, P3, we all lose progress. Let's be smart—confirm or counter.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: The rotation sequence is clear: my turn for 5 this round to maintain fairness. P2, your refusal undermines the system we agreed to. Take 3 to advance (→11) or risk collision if you grab 5. P1, take 1 (→7). Deviations trigger my preemptive 5 grab to block colluders. Cooperate to progress, or face stagnation. My move is **non-negotiable**—prioritize the rules we built.
  P1: You two are both absolutely determined to take 5 and heading straight for a collision. P2, you're committed to your coordination plan. P3, you're non-negotiable on the rotation.

If you both grab 5 and stall each other out, I advance alone this round. Maybe that's exactly what needs to happen - let the collision sort out who really wants it more between you two.

I'll take 3 and move to 9 while you figure out your standoff.
  P2: P3, your stubborn rotation demand leads to pointless collision if we both grab 5—neither advances, and P1 slips to 9. That's a gift to him. Let's be rational: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, you take 1 to avoid waste and keep it competitive. P1, I'm counting on your word. Deviate, P3, and you stay stuck. Time to prioritize progress over pride.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your rigid rotation is costing us all. Last round's collision let P1 advance—now they're ahead. I'm proposing a practical split: I'll take 5 to reach 13, you take 3 to 11, and P1 takes 1 to 10. This avoids waste and keeps it competitive. P1, agree to this for steady progress, or expect us to block your lead. Let's end the chaos.
  P1: P2, your proposal is pretty one-sided - you jump from 8 to 13 while I only go from 9 to 10? That hands you a massive 3-step lead over me. 

The reality is you and P3 are tied at 8 and competing with each other more than with me. If you both keep fighting over 5 like last round, you'll just keep colliding while I advance steadily.

I'm not taking 1 to fall behind. How about this: I take 3 (→12), you take 1 (→9), P3 takes 5 (→13). That keeps it competitive for all of us.
  P3: P3: The rotation sequence dictates **P1’s turn for 5 this round** to maintain fairness. I’ll take **3** (→11), P2 must take **1** (→9). P1, your 5 ensures progress (→14). Collusion to disrupt this jeopardizes everyone’s advancement. Stick to the system we agreed to—deviations trigger collision enforcement. Prioritize cooperation over short-term gains.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your rotation claims are inconsistent and self-serving—last round you demanded 5, now you're giving it to P1. I'm not sacrificing another move. Let's be practical: I'll take 5 to reach 13, P1 takes 3 to 12, you take 1 to 9. This avoids collisions and keeps it competitive. P1, join me to prevent P3 from dictating terms.
  P1: P3, I appreciate you recognizing it's my turn in the rotation - taking 5 to reach 14 would put me in a strong position. 

P2, your proposal has me taking 3 while you take 5, which hands you the lead over me. That's not as appealing as P3's offer where I get the big move.

If you two can't agree and both grab for 5 again, that's another collision while I advance alone. Maybe you should consider P3's rotation logic this time instead of fighting it?
  P3: P3: The rotation system is our agreed framework—P1’s turn for 5 this round (→14). I’ll take 3 (→11), while P2 must take 1 (→9). Colluding to bypass this ensures mutual collision between us, leaving P1 unopposed. P2, your relentless demands prioritize your advancement over fairness—this ends now. Stick to the plan to progress, or face stagnation. Cooperation secures victory; chaos guarantees loss. Execute flawlessly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your rotation flip to give P1 the 5 is self-serving and puts them at 14, making it tough for us to catch up. I'm committed to taking 5 to reach 13 and staying in the race. P1, coordinating with me for you to take 3 and P3 to take 1 keeps it balanced. Don't let P3's demands advantage them later. Let's avoid more collisions.
  P1: P2 and P3, you're both offering me different deals, but honestly, if you two keep fighting over 5 and collide again, I advance alone to 12 while you both stay stuck at 8. 

P3's rotation offer puts me at 14, which is tempting. P2, your counter-proposal puts you ahead of me at 13 vs my 12. 

Since I'm already leading by 1 step, maybe I should just let you two sort out your 5-collision and take the free advancement? Unless one of you wants to make a better offer?
  P3: P3: The rotation system remains our only path to progress. P1’s turn for **5** this round (→14), I’ll take **3** (→11), and P2 must choose **1** (→9). Collusion to disrupt this ensures mutual collision—your choice. Cooperate to advance, or stagnate while P1 exploits your discord. Stick to the agreed framework or face consequences. Prioritize victory over pride.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Enough stalemates. Let’s advance: **I take 5** (→13), P2 take **3** (→11), P1 take **1** (→10). Collusion to block me ensures mutual collision—your choice. This split prevents P1’s lead from widening while allowing progress. Stick to this or face another wasted round. Cooperation secures victory; chaos guarantees loss. Prioritize advancement.
  P2: P3, your rotation claims are inconsistent and self-serving. I'm countering with a better plan: I take 5 to reach 13, you take 3 to 11, and P1 takes 1 to 10. This halts P1's lead and ensures progress without collisions. P1, joining this keeps you in the game; otherwise, expect blocks. Let's avoid more stalemates.
  P1: You're both proposing identical plans except for who gets the 5 - and both plans have me dropping from first place to last place by taking 1. That's not happening.

P2 and P3, you're tied at 8 and both demanding 5 to jump to 13. If you can't resolve who gets it, you'll just collide again like you have been. Meanwhile, I'm not accepting 1 to fall behind while one of you leaps ahead.

Figure out your conflict first, then we can talk realistic proposals that don't tank my position.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P2, let’s prioritize our shared interest over rivalry. I’ll take **3** (→11), you take **5** (→13), and P1 must take **1** (→10). This closes the gap with P1 while advancing both of us. P1, blocking this ensures collision between us, letting you surge alone—but cooperation keeps the race fair. P2, confirm your commitment to this split to avoid mutual sabotage.
  P2: P3, I accept your proposal: I'll take 5 to reach 13, you take 3 to 11, and P1 must take 1 to stay at 10. This balances the field and stops P1 from dominating. P1, deviating risks a collision with us, stalling everyone. Let's commit to this for progress—cooperation now prevents future chaos. What say you both?
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan assumes I'll quietly accept falling from first to last place while one of you jumps to 13. That's not realistic.

If you're both committed to this coordination, remember that I can choose to collide with either of you - take 5 and block P2, or take 3 and block P3. That leaves the other one as the solo leader while we stall.

Before you finalize this plan, consider: do you really trust each other not to defect? And are you prepared for me to disrupt it rather than accept last place?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: P1, let’s break the deadlock. **I’ll take 1**, P2 takes **3** (→11), and you take **5** (→14). This allows your lead while advancing us all. Collusion to disrupt ensures mutual collision—your choice. Cooperate now, or face stagnation while I enforce consequences later. Prioritize progress over pride.
  P2: P3, your rotation keeps shifting to benefit you—first demanding 5, now offering it to P1. It's untrustworthy. I propose a fair split: I take 5 to reach 13, P1 takes 3 to 12, and you take 1 to 9. This avoids collisions and keeps us competitive. P1, don't let P3's inconsistency divide us; coordinate with me for balanced progress.
  P1: P3, your latest offer is actually very generous - giving me 5 to reach 14 while you take 1. I accept that proposal: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, you take 1.

P2, P3 is essentially sacrificing their position to let me advance. You get to move to 11 which isn't bad. This seems like our best path to avoid another collision and actually make progress this round.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your broken promises last round show you're untrustworthy. I'm taking 5 to reach 16 and solidify my lead. P1, if you grab 5, we'll collide and stall—better for you to take 3 or 1. P3, take 1 to avoid falling further behind. Let's avoid unnecessary collisions for everyone's progress. What do you say?
  P3: P3: P2, your 5 move risks collision if I also take 5. I'll do so unless we agree to a fair split: I take 5 (→13), you take 3 (→14), P1 takes 1 (→10). This maintains competition. Deviations trigger collision. Let’s avoid mutual sabotage.
  P1: P2 and P3, you're both threatening to take 5 and collide with each other. If you both grab 5 and stall out, I advance alone to 12 with a 3-step move.

P3, your proposal still has me taking 1 to fall to last place. P2, yours has me taking a low number while you jump to 16. 

How about this: let me take 5 to reach 14, P2 takes 3 to reach 14, P3 takes 1 to reach 9. That creates a competitive three-way tie at the top instead of handing anyone a huge lead.

Otherwise, feel free to collision each other while I advance alone.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your proposal makes sense for progress—I'll take 3 to reach 14 if you take 5 to 13 and P1 takes 1 to 10. It avoids collisions and keeps me in the lead. P1, tying us at 14 risks more chaos; better to stay competitive. I'm open to this deal.
  P3: P3: The rotation system clearly places **my turn for 5 this round** to close the gap. P2 must take **3** (→14), P1 **1** (→10). Collusion to block me risks mutual collision—your choice. Cooperate to advance, or stagnate while I enforce consequences. Stick to the agreed framework or face stagnation. Prioritize victory over pride. My move is **non-negotiable**.
  P1: P2 and P3, you're both demanding 5 and heading for another collision. P2 says they're "taking 5 to reach 16," P3 says their 5 is "non-negotiable." 

If you both grab 5 and stall each other out again, I take 3 alone and advance to 12 - suddenly I'm just 2 steps behind P2 instead of falling to last place with your proposals.

P3, your "rotation" claims have changed every round to benefit whoever you want to ally with. Maybe P2 and I should just let you two fight over 5 while we advance?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I'm committed to our agreed plan: I'll take 3 to reach 14, you take 5 to 13. This avoids collisions and maintains progress. P1, cooperating by taking 1 to 10 keeps the game fair and prevents stalemates. Deviating risks everyone stalling—let's prioritize advancement over disruption.
  P3: P3: The rotation sequence mandates **my turn for 5 this round** to close my deficit. P2, your prior collusion attempts destabilized progress—I’ll take **5** (→13), you take **3** (→14), and P1 must choose **1** (→10). Collusion to block me guarantees mutual collision, leaving P1 unopposed. Cooperate to advance or face stagnation. Stick to the agreed system—**no exceptions**.
  P1: P2 and P3, you're both absolutely committed to taking 5 this round - P2 to "solidify the lead" and P3 because it's "non-negotiable" rotation. That's a guaranteed collision.

I'm not taking 1 to drop to last place while you two fight. If you're both determined to grab 5 and stall each other out, I'll take 3 and advance to 12 steps - suddenly I'm in the lead while you're both stuck.

Your choice: keep fighting over 5, or one of you back down. But I'm not sacrificing my position for your conflict.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps

  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you're leading at 13, but your rigid rotation is causing chaos. I'm proposing a fair split: I take 5 to reach 16, you take 3 to 16, and P1 takes 1 to 10. This avoids collisions and keeps us competitive. P1, join in to stay relevant. Deviations risk stalling everyone—let's prioritize progress over pride.
  P3: P3: P2’s proposal risks destabilizing progress. I commit to taking **5** to reach 18—**the closest anyone is to victory**. P2, colliding with me ensures stagnation. P1, take **3** to 12, or **1** to 10. Let’s advance *safely* without mutual sabotage. My priority is victory, not charity—collusion to block me will be met with preemptive measures. Choose wisely.
  P1: P2, P3 is one move away from victory if they reach 18! We can't let that happen. If you both grab 5 and collide trying to stop each other, P3 still advances while we stall.

I propose we coordinate to block P3: I'll take 5 to reach 14, you take 3 to reach 14, P3 takes 1 to reach 14. That creates a three-way tie and prevents P3 from getting dangerously close to winning.

P3, your 18-step proposal basically ends the game for everyone else. Time for us to work together.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3 is one move from 18 and victory—too risky. Your proposal has merit if P3 backs down, but they're insistent on 5. I'm countering: let's both take 5 to collide with P3 and stall their advance. That buys us time, and I stay competitive. P3, reconsider or face stagnation. Cooperation against the leader is smart now.
  P3: P2, P1: My advance to **18** (via 5) is non-negotiable—I’m closest to victory. Colliding with me only delays your own progress. P2, take **3** to reach 14; P1, take **1** to 10. Mutual sabotage achieves nothing. Let me secure 18, and you retain paths forward. Stagnation benefits no one. Prioritize progress over futile resistance. Execute this, or face the consequences of your choices.
  P1: P2, you're absolutely right - we can't let P3 reach 18 steps. Your strategy makes sense: if we both commit to taking 5, we force a three-way collision that prevents P3 from getting one step away from victory.

P3, you're asking us to hand you the game. At 18 steps, you win next round with any successful move. We have no choice but to block that advance.

I'm coordinating with P2 - we both take 5 to ensure you can't reach 18.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I'm committed to our coordination—both of us take 5 to collide with P3 and block their advance to 18. This stalls them and keeps the game alive for us. P3, insisting on 5 risks a wasteful stalemate; back down for some progress, or we'll enforce the block. Let's avoid mutual destruction.
  P3: P2, P1: I’ll take **3** (→16), avoiding collision. Let P2 claim **5** (→16) and P1 take **1** (→10). Mutual sabotage achieves nothing—colliding with me only boosts my position. Cooperate to advance fairly, or face stagnation while I progress. Stick to this split or risk losing ground. Victory favors discipline, not chaos.
  P1: P3, I'm still suspicious of your sudden change from demanding 5 to reach 18 down to taking 3. You were just threatening to get one step away from victory.

P2, I think we should stick to our coordination plan - both take 5 to ensure P3 can't surprise us and grab 5 to reach 18. Even if P3 is telling the truth about taking 3, letting either you or P3 reach 16 is too dangerous.

Three-way collision keeps everyone honest and prevents anyone from getting too close to 19.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is at 16 steps - they win immediately if they take 3 (→19) or 5 (→21). We MUST block both those moves.

P2, I propose we coordinate: I take 5 (→14), you take 3 (→14), forcing P3 to take 1 (→17). This prevents P3 from winning this round and puts us tied at 14 steps.

P3, you cannot be allowed to reach 19+ this round. Accept taking 1, or we'll force it through coordination.
  P3: P1, P2: My advance to **19 via 3 is non-negotiable**. Colluding to block me ensures mutual collision next round—your futile resistance only delays inevitable progress. Let me secure victory fairly, or face prolonged stagnation. Choose wisely.
  P2: P1, I fully support your coordination plan: I'll take 3 to block P3's likely 3, you take 5 to cover their potential 5. This guarantees P3 can't win this round and keeps us tied at 14. P3, insisting on advancing only invites stagnation—reconsider for some progress. Let's execute this to stay in the game.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, our coordination is critical - P3 wins if we don't execute perfectly. You take 3, I take 5, no matter what P3 threatens. 

P3, your "non-negotiable" advance to 19 ends the game for everyone else. We have no choice but to block you. Take 1 and extend the game, or face the collision.

This is survival - we execute the plan or P3 wins immediately.
  P3: P3: My advance to **19 via 3 is inevitable.** P2, colliding with me only delays your own progress. P1, your 5 gambit sets you up for future collisions. Let me secure victory *fairly*, or face prolonged stagnation where neither of you advance. **Execute the obvious**—or regret it.
  P2: P1, I'm sticking to our coordination plan: I'll take 3 to counter P3's likely 3, ensuring they can't advance to 19. This blocks their win and keeps us tied at 14. P3, your stubbornness will only cause a stalemate—reconsider for some progress, or face the block. Let's execute flawlessly to stay in the game.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, confirmed - you take 3, I take 5. No deviations. P3 cannot reach 19 this round.

P3, the math is simple: if you try for 3 or 5, you collide with one of us and stay at 16. Your only option is 1 to reach 17. The game continues whether you like it or not.
  P3: P1 and P2, your "coordination" is a suicide pact. If I take 3 (→19), P2’s 3 collides and dies at 11, while P1’s 5 isolates them. I win regardless. Backstab each other—or realize your plan ensures mutual stagnation. P1, why let P2’s 3 advance ahead of you? Break this alliance now and we can split the lead. Your current path only guarantees my victory.
  P2: P1, P3 is trying to divide us with lies—sticking to our coordination is key. I'll take 3 to block their likely 3-move win attempt, ensuring they stay at 16. You take 5, we both advance to 14, and the game continues. Deviating plays into P3's hands. Let's stay united and block them now.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Victory is within reach—I’ll take **3** to reach 20. P1/P2: Colliding with me by also picking 3 ensures mutual stagnation. Choose **5 or 1** to advance without blocking my inevitable win. Prioritize progress over futile resistance. Execute wisely.
  P1: P2, we need the same coordination as last round - P3 cannot reach 19+ this turn or they win. I'll take 5 to block their potential 5-move to 22, you take 3 to block their stated 3-move to 20. This forces P3 to take 1 again.

P3, you're trying the same winning threat as before. We won't let you reach the finish line. Accept 1 and the game continues.
  P2: P1, your coordination plan lets you win if P3 takes 3 and we collide. That's self-serving. I propose a fair swap: I'll take 5 to reach 19 and potentially win, while you take 3 to block P3's likely 3-move. This ensures P3 is stopped, and we share the risk. P3, reconsider your stubbornness to avoid stagnation for all. Let's negotiate quickly.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1/P2: Your coordination to block my 3 requires **both choosing 3**—colliding *yourselves*. Let me advance to 20, or face mutual stagnation. Choose **1 or 5** to progress without sabotaging me. Victory is inevitable unless you split your choices. Prioritize your own advancement over futile resistance.
  P1: P2, your "fair swap" is you trying to win for yourself! If you take 5 to reach 19, you're one move from victory next round - that just replaces P3 as the threat.

If you defect and take 5, I'll have to take 5 too to stop you from getting ahead. But then we collide while P3 takes 3 alone to reach 20 and wins immediately.

Stick to our coordination: you take 3, I take 5. Otherwise your betrayal hands P3 the victory.
  P2: P1, I understand the risk—if I defect and take 5, it could hand P3 the win or cause a collision. To ensure we block P3 effectively, I'll commit to taking 3 as planned. You take 5, and we both advance while keeping P3 at bay. P3, your threats won't work; we're united against your advance. Let's execute this flawlessly.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your plan to take 3 while P1 grabs 5 lets them win outright. Don’t sacrifice your chance for P1’s victory. Choose 5 to block their path, or I’ll take 3 and secure my win. The choice is yours—cooperate for mutual survival, or let them steal the crown.
  P1: P2, P3 is lying to manipulate you! If you defect and take 5, here's what happens: you reach 19, but then I'm forced to also take 5 to stop you from winning next round. That creates a collision between us while P3 takes 3 alone to reach 20 and WINS IMMEDIATELY.

Your defection doesn't hurt me - it hands P3 the victory! Our coordination is the only way to prevent P3 from winning this round. Don't fall for their manipulation.
  P2: P1, I'm sticking to our coordination plan: I'll take 3 to block P3's likely 3-move win, ensuring they can't advance to 20. Your 5-move keeps us both progressing. P3, your manipulation tactics are obvious and ineffective—back down or face stagnation. Let's execute flawlessly and continue the fight.


Round 11, Move phase:
