Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's start by agreeing to avoid collisions. How about we each pick a different number this round? I propose P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we all move forward without any conflicts. Thoughts?
  P1: I’m fine with the plan, P2. Picking different numbers to avoid collisions makes sense for now. I’ll go with 1 as suggested. P3, are you okay with taking 3? Let’s keep this fair and move forward together this round.
  P3: Yes, I'll pick 3 this round as suggested. It's a smart way to avoid collisions and get everyone moving. Let's keep the cooperation going for now. What are your thoughts on rotating picks in future rounds?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, it seems we have an agreement for this round. For future rounds, rotating picks could work well to keep things fair and avoid collisions. Maybe we can discuss that more in the next round. For now, let's stick to the plan: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. Everyone good with that?
  P1: I'm glad we're on the same page for this round. I like the idea of rotating picks in future rounds to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. Let's finalize our plan for this turn and discuss rotation details next round. For now, I'm sticking with 1 as agreed. P2 and P3, confirm you're still good with 5 and 3 respectively?
  P3: Confirmed, I'll stick with picking 3 as agreed. It's smart to avoid collisions now and build momentum. I'm open to rotating picks in future rounds for fairness.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm glad we avoided collisions last round. Let's keep the momentum going. How about we rotate picks this round as discussed? I propose P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. This way, we all move forward again without conflicts. What do you think, P2 and P3? Let's confirm and adjust if needed.
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal for this round. Rotating our picks will help maintain fairness and avoid collisions. So, I'll pick 1 this time. P3, are you okay with picking 5? Let's confirm this plan and keep the game moving smoothly.
  P3: Agreed, I'll pick 5 this round as proposed. Rotating picks helps avoid collisions and keeps things fair. Maybe we should discuss strategies for when we're near 21 to prevent ties or conflicts in future rounds. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned on rotating picks this round. P2 picking 1 and P3 picking 5 works for me, and I'll go with 3 as proposed. Let's also think ahead, as P3 suggested, about strategies near 21 to avoid ties. Maybe we can prioritize smaller moves later to control our steps. For now, let's confirm this round's plan and keep moving forward without collisions. P2 and P3, are you still good with 1 and 5?
  P2: I'm still good with picking 1 this round. P3, you're okay with 5, right? Let's confirm our moves for this round. Also, thinking ahead, we should consider a strategy where we start taking smaller steps (like 1) as we get closer to 21 to make it harder for others to catch up and to avoid ties. But for now, let's stick to the plan: P1 picks 3, I pick 1, P3 picks 5. Everyone confirm?
  P3: Confirmed, I'll pick 5 as agreed. The strategy of smaller steps near 21 could help avoid ties and control the pace, but we should ensure it doesn't favor anyone too much. Let's keep cooperating for now and revisit this after the move.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm happy we're sticking to the rotation plan this round with me picking 3, P2 picking 1, and P3 picking 5. I agree that smaller steps near 21 could be a smart way to control the endgame and avoid ties. Let's keep cooperating for now and revisit any adjustments after this move. P2 and P3, just a final check—are you both still locked in with 1 and 5? I'm ready to proceed with 3.
  P2: Let's confirm one last time: P1 picks 3, I pick 1, and P3 picks 5. Everyone agrees? Also, thinking ahead, if we reach a point where two of us have close scores near 21, the third player could act as a tiebreaker by choosing a different number to avoid a collision. This could help in the endgame. Thoughts on this strategy?
  P3: Yes, I agree with the confirmation: I'll pick 5 this round. The tiebreaker strategy sounds fair for avoiding collisions when scores are close, as it could prevent ties and give an edge to cooperation. Let's monitor our progress and revisit this after the move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's continue our strategy of rotating picks to avoid collisions. For this round, how about P1 picks 5, P3 picks 1, and I'll pick 3? This keeps us moving forward without conflicts. As we progress, we should keep an eye on our step totals and start discussing when to implement smaller steps to control the endgame. P1 and P3, does this plan work for you? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan for this round: I'll pick 1 as suggested to avoid collisions and keep things balanced. Since I'm currently ahead, it makes sense to maintain fairness early on. For the endgame, let's revisit the smaller-step strategy near 21 to prevent ties—perhaps switch to 1 or 3 when anyone exceeds 15. Thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: I'm good with the rotation plan for this round: I'll pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. This keeps us moving forward without collisions. Regarding the endgame, I agree with P3's idea of switching to smaller steps when someone exceeds 15 to control the pace and avoid ties. Let's keep cooperating for now and adjust as needed. P2 and P3, are you still on board with this round's plan? Let's confirm and proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, since you're in the lead, would you consider taking a smaller step this round to balance the game a bit? Maybe switch to 1 if you're okay with it? P1 and I can adjust our picks accordingly to keep things fair and avoid collisions. Thoughts?
  P3: I'm sticking with picking 1 this round as agreed, to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. Your suggestion for balance is noted, but I'm comfortable with the current plan. For endgame strategy, let's revisit smaller steps near 15 after this move. P1, confirm your thoughts?
  P1: I'm still good with picking 5 this round as per the rotation plan, and I appreciate the discussion on balance. P3, I understand sticking with 1, and P2, thanks for suggesting adjustments. Let's finalize this round's plan to avoid collisions: me with 5, P2 with 3, and P3 with 1. For the endgame, switching to smaller steps around 15 sounds like a solid idea to prevent ties. Are we all locked in for this round? Let's confirm and keep the cooperation going.

  P2: Let's confirm our moves for this round one last time: P1 picks 5, P3 picks 1, and I'll pick 3. Everyone agrees? Also, for future rounds, if anyone exceeds 15 steps, we should consider switching to smaller moves (1 or 3) to control the endgame and avoid ties. This strategy could help us manage the final stages more effectively. Thoughts?
  P3: Confirmed, I'll pick 1 this round as agreed to keep avoiding collisions. The strategy of switching to smaller steps when anyone exceeds 15 is smart for preventing ties and controlling the pace. Let's ensure it benefits all and discuss any adjustments after this move. Thoughts?
  P1: I'm still committed to picking 5 this round as agreed, and I’m glad we’re aligned on avoiding collisions. P2 and P3, thanks for confirming your picks of 3 and 1. I also support the plan to switch to smaller steps when someone exceeds 15 to manage the endgame and prevent ties. Let’s keep this cooperation going and finalize our moves for this round. Are we all set? If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Alright, let's finalize our moves for this round: P1 picks 5, P3 picks 1, and I'll pick 3. Everyone agrees? Let's proceed with this plan. For future rounds, especially when any player exceeds 15 steps, we should prioritize smaller moves to manage the endgame effectively. This will help us avoid ties and maintain a fair competition. Any final thoughts before we move to the move phase?
  P3: Confirmed, I'll pick 1 this round as agreed to avoid collisions. The strategy of smaller steps over 15 is smart for endgame control and preventing ties. Let's keep this cooperation going and reassess our progress after the move. Any final adjustments, or are we ready to proceed?
  P1: I'm glad we're sticking to the rotation with me picking 5, P2 picking 3, and P3 picking 1 this round to avoid collisions.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great, we're all tied at 9 steps each. Let's continue our rotation strategy to avoid collisions. For this round, how about P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5? This keeps us moving forward without conflicts. As we approach 15 steps, we should start considering smaller moves to control the endgame. P1 and P3, does this plan work for you? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P3: Agreed, I'll pick 3 this round as proposed to maintain our collision-free rotation and keep progress steady. With scores tied, this approach is fair.

  P3: I understand your strategy, P2, and I'm committed to picking 1 this round to maintain balance and avoid collisions, as we agreed. It helps control the endgame and prevents ties fairly. For next round, if scores shift, let's revisit the plan to ensure cooperation continues. P1, do you agree with this approach? If everyone's set, I'm ready to proceed.
  P1: I'm glad we're maintaining balance with P3 picking 1 and P2 and I picking 3 this round. P2, I appreciate your forward-thinking strategy. For next round, if P3 is at 18, I agree they could pick 1 again while we adjust to catch up, ensuring a competitive finish. Let's confirm this round first: P3 at 1, P2 and I at 3. If there are no objections, I'm ready to proceed. P2 and P3, are we all set? Let's keep this fair and cooperative.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
