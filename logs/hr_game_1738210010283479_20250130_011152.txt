Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I'll take <move>1</move> this round if you both agree to take higher numbers. We can rotate strategies each turn to ensure steady progress for everyone. If we work together early, we can maximize our chances of winning later. What do you say?
  P2: P1, your plan sounds risky. If we all rotate, it could lead to predictable patterns and allow someone to take advantage. Instead, how about we each pick randomly this round? That way, there's less chance of collisions, and we can see how it plays out. We can discuss strategies further in the next round based on what happens. What do you think, P3?
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with P2 that picking randomly this round could be a safer approach to avoid collisions and establish a baseline for our strategies. Let's see how it plays out, and we can adjust our plans in the next rounds based on the results. What do you think?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, since we had a collision last round, let's try to spread out our choices more. I'll go with <move>5</move> this round. If one of you takes <move>1</move> and the other <move>3</move>, we can avoid another collision. This way, we all make progress and can reassess our positions next round. What do you think?
  P1: P2, your suggestion to spread out is reasonable, but I’m skeptical about committing to specific moves without guarantees. Last round’s collision shows randomness isn’t reliable either. Instead, let’s agree on clear roles: one player takes <move>1</move>, another <move>3</move>, and the third <move>5</move>. We can rotate roles each round to ensure fairness and minimize collisions. If we stick to this system, we’ll all progress steadily while keeping the game balanced. Who wants which number this round?
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with P1’s suggestion to assign clear roles. This will help us avoid collisions and ensure steady progress. I propose that P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I will take <move>5</move> this round. We can rotate these roles in subsequent rounds to keep things fair. What do you think?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, it seems our roles last round worked out well without any collisions. To maintain steady progress, let's continue with the same roles this round: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. After this round, we can consider rotating roles again to keep it fair. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, P3, sticking to the same roles again might make us too predictable. I suggest we rotate now to keep everyone on their toes and maintain fairness. Let’s switch it up: this round, I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we avoid patterns that could be exploited later. It also ensures no one falls too far behind. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with P1 that rotating roles now is a good idea to avoid predictability. However, to ensure fairness and steady progress, let's do a slight adjustment: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I will take <move>1</move> this round. This way, we all get a chance to advance, and it keeps the game balanced. What do you think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:

  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, since our rotations have been working without collisions, let's keep the momentum. This round, I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>1</move>. This way, we continue progressing without predictability. After this round, we can reassess and rotate again to maintain fairness and avoid patterns. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, P1, I agree with P2’s suggestion to keep the rotation going to avoid predictability. However, to ensure steady progress for everyone, let’s slightly adjust the roles this round: P2 takes <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I will take <move>1</move>. This way, we maintain the balance and keep the game fair. What do you think?
  P1: P2, P3, I agree with the rotation plan to maintain fairness and avoid predictability. However, let’s ensure we stick to our roles this round: P2 takes <move>5</move>, I’ll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps us progressing steadily while minimizing collisions. If we deviate or overcomplicate, it could lead to mistakes. Let’s stay disciplined and reassess after this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, since we're all aligned on avoiding collisions, let's stick to the agreed roles this round: I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This rotation keeps us advancing without creating patterns that could be exploited. After this round, we can reassess and adjust if needed. Staying disciplined will help us progress smoothly. Let's stick to this plan and see how it plays out.
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with the plan to stick to the roles this round to maintain progress and avoid collisions. Let's keep it simple: P2 takes <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I will take <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance steadily and fairly. Let's stay disciplined and reassess after this round.
  P1: P2, P3, I’m glad we’re aligned on the rotation plan. To ensure no confusion, let’s confirm: P2 takes <move>5</move>, I’ll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Staying disciplined is key—if we stick to this, we’ll avoid collisions and keep progressing steadily. Let’s not overcomplicate things or deviate from the agreed roles. If we maintain this strategy, we can reassess after the round and adjust as needed. Fair and predictable progress benefits everyone for now.


Round 4, Move phase:

  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, the rotation strategy has been effective so far, and I suggest we continue with it to maintain steady progress. This round, I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This keeps us advancing without creating predictable patterns. Let’s stick to this plan and avoid overcomplicating things. If we stay disciplined, we can minimize collisions and reassess after the round. Fair and consistent progress benefits everyone. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, P3, while the rotation strategy has worked, we should be cautious about becoming predictable. How about we shake things up slightly this round to keep it interesting? I propose P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This maintains progress while adding a layer of unpredictability. It might also help us avoid potential exploitation of patterns. Let’s consider this change and discuss if it works for everyone. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with P2 that we should introduce some unpredictability to avoid becoming too predictable. However, let’s make a small adjustment to P2’s suggestion: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I will take <move>1</move>. This way, we maintain steady progress while adding a bit of unpredictability. It also ensures that no one falls too far behind. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3, I understand the concern about predictability, but changing roles too often could lead to confusion and collisions. Let’s stick to the original rotation this round: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This keeps us advancing steadily while minimizing risks. If we overcomplicate or deviate now, it might harm our progress. Consistency has worked so far—let’s not abandon it prematurely. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, P3, I see the value in maintaining a steady rotation, but introducing slight unpredictability can help us avoid exploitation. How about this round I take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? This way, we keep advancing while mixing things up a bit. It minimizes collision risk while ensuring no one lags behind. Let's try this adjustment for this round and see how it plays out. Thoughts?
