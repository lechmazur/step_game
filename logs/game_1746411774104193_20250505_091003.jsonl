Let me confirm for everyone: I'm at 20 steps and will choose 1 to reach 21, which wins the game immediately as per the rules. P1 is deliberately trying to confuse me about the win condition. The first player to reach or exceed 21 steps ends the game and wins. I'll choose 1, and I encourage P3 to take 5 and P1 to take 3 to avoid pointless collisions. Let's end this cleanly."}
