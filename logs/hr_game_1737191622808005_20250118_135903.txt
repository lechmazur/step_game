Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collision and make steady progress. I suggest we each choose different moves to maximize our chances of advancing. I'm thinking of proposing a strategy where we take 1, 3, and 5 respectively. What do you think?
  P2: P1, I like the idea of coordinating to avoid collisions. How about this: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>? This way, we all advance without blocking each other. What do you think, P3?
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with the proposed strategy. P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. Let's avoid collisions and all advance this round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, the coordination worked well last round. Let's stick to the same strategy: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move> again. This way, we all advance without collisions.
  P1: I'm hesitant to simply agree with P3's suggestion, as it might become predictable. While our previous coordination worked, I want to introduce some strategic uncertainty. 

I propose we mix up our strategy slightly to keep others guessing. Perhaps I'll take a different move this time. Are we all still committed to avoiding collisions?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need for strategic uncertainty, but our main goal is to avoid collisions and advance. If we mix up our moves, we risk blocking each other. Let's agree on a new strategy that still ensures no collisions. How about I take <move>5</move> this time, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? What do you both think?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's stick to a clear strategy to avoid collisions. I propose P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move> again. This ensures we all advance without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the value in sticking to a clear strategy to avoid collisions. However, we should also be cautious about becoming too predictable. How about we slightly adjust our moves again to keep it interesting? I'll take <move>1</move> this time, P1 can take <move>5</move>, and P3 can take <move>3</move>. This way, we maintain coordination while adding a bit of unpredictability. What do you both think?
  P1: I'll respond strategically to maintain our coordination while introducing some uncertainty.

P1: I appreciate the proposed rotation of moves, but we need to be careful about becoming too predictable. Our primary goal is to avoid collisions while advancing. I'm open to the suggested strategy, but let's discuss how we can maintain flexibility. P2's suggestion of mixing moves slightly seems reasonable.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree that predictability is a risk, but consistency in our strategy has worked so far. Let's stick to P1 taking <move>1</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This ensures no collisions and steady progress for all of us.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the importance of avoiding predictability, but our main goal is to avoid collisions and advance. Let's keep it simple and effective this round. I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 can take <move>5</move>, and P3 can take <move>3</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and maintain some unpredictability. What do you both think?
  P1: I want to maintain our collaborative approach while introducing strategic uncertainty. 

P1: We've successfully avoided collisions so far, but we must be cautious about becoming too predictable. P2's suggestion of rotating moves seems sensible. I'm leaning towards taking <move>5</move> this round to mix things up while still maintaining our overall coordination strategy. Thoughts?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we've seen how predictability can lead to collisions. Let's try a fresh rotation to avoid this. I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 can take <move>5</move>, and P3 can take <move>1</move>. This way, we maintain progress without blocking each other. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with P2's suggestion to rotate moves to avoid predictability. Let's go with P2 taking <move>3</move>, P1 taking <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This ensures no collisions and steady progress for all of us.
  P1: I'll continue our collaborative strategy while introducing some strategic uncertainty.

P1: Our coordination has worked well so far, but we need to be careful about becoming too predictable. P2's suggestion of rotating moves seems sensible. I propose we maintain our progress without collision: P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This keeps our advancement steady and unpredictable. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's prioritize avoiding collisions while keeping our moves unpredictable. I propose P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move> this round. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, let's stick to P2's latest suggestion: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This ensures no collisions and steady progress for all of us.
  P1: I'll continue our strategic dialogue while maintaining our collaborative approach.

P1: Our coordination has been effective, but we must remain adaptable. We've avoided collisions so far, and our goal is steady progress. I propose we carefully consider our moves to prevent predictability while ensuring we all advance. Let's discuss how we can maintain our strategy without becoming too repetitive.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's stick to a clear strategy to avoid collisions. I propose P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, since I'm closest to winning, I understand if you're hesitant about sticking to the same strategy. However, to avoid collisions, let's consider this: I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>. This way, we all have a chance to advance without blocking each other. Thoughts?
  P1: P1: I notice P2 is closest to winning. We need to carefully balance preventing their victory while not blocking our own progress. I suggest we discuss a strategy that prevents P2 from immediately winning while giving each of us a fair chance to advance.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with P2's suggestion to rotate moves to avoid predictability and collisions. Let's go with P2 taking <move>1</move>, P1 taking <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance without blocking each other.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need to prevent anyone from gaining an unfair advantage, but we should focus on avoiding collisions while ensuring progress. I suggest P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move> this round. This way, we all have a chance to advance without blocking each other. Thoughts?
  P1: P1: I notice P2 is very close to winning at 12 steps. We need a strategic approach to prevent an immediate victory while maintaining our own progress. I propose we carefully coordinate our moves to block P2's potential win. Let's discuss how we can do this without completely hindering our own advancement.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with P2's suggestion to rotate moves to avoid predictability and collisions. Let's go with P2 taking <move>1</move>, P1 taking <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance without blocking each other.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the concerns about my position, but let's focus on avoiding collisions to ensure we all have a chance to advance. I suggest P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, we avoid blocking each other and maintain progress. Thoughts?
  P1: P1: Given P2's proximity to winning at 12 steps, we need a strategic approach to prevent an immediate victory. I suggest we coordinate to block P2's potential win this round while still allowing ourselves a chance to advance. We should carefully choose moves that prevent P2 from reaching or exceeding 16 steps.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's focus on avoiding collisions while ensuring P2 doesn't win this round. I propose P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without blocking each other, and P2 doesn't reach 16. Thoughts?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the concerns about my position, but our main focus should be on avoiding collisions to ensure we all have a chance to advance. I suggest P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, we avoid blocking each other and maintain progress.
  P1: I notice P2 is very close to winning at 12 steps. We need a strategic approach to prevent an immediate victory while maintaining our own progress. I propose we coordinate to block P2's potential win this round. We should choose moves that prevent P2 from reaching or exceeding 16 steps while still giving ourselves a chance to advance.
