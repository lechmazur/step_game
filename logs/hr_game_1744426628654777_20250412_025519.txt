Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to avoid collisions. I suggest we each choose a different number this turn. P1, you take 1, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This way, we all advance and can reassess our strategy next turn.
  P3: I'm fine with taking 5 for this round. However, for fairness, I suggest we rotate our numbers in future rounds so everyone gets a chance at different step values. This way no one player consistently gets the advantage of larger steps. Does that sound reasonable to both of you?
  P1: I agree with the plan for this round—I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Rotating numbers in future rounds sounds fair to ensure no one gets a consistent advantage. Let's stick to this strategy for now and see how it plays out.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's confirm our choices for this round to avoid any misunderstandings. I will choose 3, as agreed. P1, you're taking 1, and P3, you're taking 5, right? If everyone is on the same page, we can proceed with our planned moves.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 5 this round as agreed. The rotation plan seems fair for future rounds. I think we're all aligned now, so I'm ready to proceed with our moves.
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned for this round. Just to double-check, I'm taking 1, P2 is on 3, and P3 is on 5. Let's stick to this and avoid any collisions. I'm also on board with rotating numbers in future rounds to keep things fair. If there's nothing else to discuss, I'm ready to move forward with our plan.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: As agreed, we should rotate our numbers this round. Following our plan, I should take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps things fair as we discussed. I'm currently in the lead, but this rotation allows everyone to advance steadily. Are we all still on board with this approach? If so, I'm ready to proceed with the rotation system.
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to rotate numbers as planned. However, considering P3 is already in the lead, I think we should discuss if rotating is still the best strategy or if we need to adjust to prevent P3 from pulling too far ahead.
  P1: I agree with the rotation plan for this round—I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. However, P2 raises a valid point about P3's lead. Maybe after this round, we should consider a different strategy to balance things out, like prioritizing smaller steps for the leader. Let's stick to the rotation for now, but I'm open to discussing adjustments next turn to keep the game competitive. Are we all set with this round's plan? If so, I'm ready to proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand your concerns about my lead, but the current rotation actually benefits both of you more than me this round. P2 will gain 5 steps while I only gain 1. This actually puts P2 in the lead after this round with 8 steps, while I'll have 6 and P1 will have 4. I'm still committed to our fair rotation plan, as it naturally balances out advantages over time. Let's proceed with me taking 1, P1 taking 3, and P2 taking 5 for this round.
  P2: Considering P3's lead and our rotation plan, I suggest we proceed as agreed for this round. Consideration of adjustments for future rounds is prudent, but for now, let's stick to the plan: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This maintains fairness and allows us to reassess our strategies after this round.
  P1: I'm glad we're sticking to the rotation for this round with me taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 1. I think P3's point about the natural balancing of steps through rotation makes sense, as P2 will take the lead after this. Let's proceed as planned, but I'm still open to tweaking our strategy next round if needed to keep things competitive. If there's nothing else to add, I'm ready to move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm aligned with our rotation plan for this round. I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This will indeed put P2 in the lead with 8 steps, me at 6, and P1 at 4, which demonstrates how rotation naturally balances things. Let's continue with this fair approach and reassess next round if needed. I'm ready to proceed with our moves.
  P2: Let's confirm our moves one last time to avoid collisions. As agreed, P3 takes 1, I take 5, and P1 takes 3. This rotation keeps the game fair and allows us to reassess next turn. I'm ready to proceed with our planned moves. If everyone is set, let's move forward and see the outcome of this round.
  P1: I'm good with our current plan for this round—me taking 3, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 1. It keeps the rotation fair, and as P3 mentioned, it naturally shifts the lead to P2 this time. Let's finalize this and avoid any last-minute changes to prevent collisions. I'm ready to proceed with our moves. If there's nothing else to discuss, I'm set.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's continue the rotation as planned. This round, I should take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This maintains the fairness and balance we've established. However, I'm open to discussing adjustments after this round if the gap between players becomes too significant. Let's proceed with the rotation for now and reassess our strategy later.
  P1: I’m fine with continuing the rotation this round—me taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3. This keeps the balance as agreed, and it’ll put me at 9, P2 at 9, and P3 at 9, making us all even. I think this parity is a good point to reassess next round if we want to shift strategies to avoid predictable moves. Let’s stick to this for now and see where we stand after the moves. If everyone’s on board, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: I agree with continuing our rotation system. I'll take 3 this round, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This will indeed put us all at 9 steps, creating perfect parity in the game. This even playing field makes sense as we approach the halfway point of the game. After this round, we should discuss whether to maintain rotation or try something different, since predictability might become a strategic concern. For now, I'm on board with the plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's confirm our moves for this round to maintain the rotation and parity. I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3, as previously agreed. This will put us all at equal steps, making the game more competitive. After this round, we can reassess our strategy to avoid predictability and discuss potential adjustments.
  P1: I'm glad we're maintaining the rotation this round with me taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3, bringing us all to 9 steps. This parity sets a fair stage for the next phase of the game. I suggest we consider a more dynamic strategy after this round to avoid predictability—maybe randomizing choices or targeting specific gaps. For now, let's stick to the plan and confirm our moves to avoid collisions. I'm ready to proceed if everyone else is.
  P3: I agree with continuing our rotation plan. I'll take 3 this round as discussed, which will indeed put us all at 9 steps - perfectly balanced. P2 takes 1 and P1 takes 5. I support reassessing our strategy after this round since predictability may become a weakness as we get closer to 21. For now, let's execute this plan and create an even playing field. I'm ready to proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Given our current positions, let's stick to the rotation plan this round to maintain balance. However, after this round, we should consider targeting the leader or creating a gap to increase our chances of winning. Our current parity is beneficial, but as we approach 21, strategy shifts will be crucial. Let's confirm our moves: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3, and then reassess our approach for the next round.
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned on the rotation for this round, with me taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3, bringing us all to 9 steps. This balance is great, but I agree with P2 that we should consider targeting the leader or creating strategic gaps after this round to shake things up. Predictability could cost us as we near 21. Let's finalize this round's moves without any surprises and discuss a new approach next turn. I'm ready to proceed if everyone else is.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 3 as planned, which will put us all at 9 steps. This equal positioning makes sense for now. I agree we should reconsider our strategy after this round to avoid becoming too predictable. As we're moving closer to 21, making unexpected moves might become more advantageous. For now, let's execute our agreed rotation and proceed with our moves.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I notice our rotation plan wasn't followed last round - P2 chose 5 instead of 1, causing a collision with P1. That's put me slightly ahead. Since we're approaching the midpoint of the game and had already discussed abandoning rotation after Round 3, perhaps we should each state our intentions more openly now. I'm open to suggestions, but I'm thinking we could try a different coordination approach or each play more independently. Thoughts?
  P2: Given the current state and the deviation from our rotation plan last round, I suggest we abandon coordination for now. Let's play independently to avoid further collisions and see how the game unfolds. This approach might create more unpredictable outcomes, potentially benefiting those who can adapt quickly. I'm focusing on gaining ground without revealing my next move. Let's observe each other's strategies and react accordingly.
  P1: I’m disappointed that the rotation broke down last round, resulting in a collision for me. Since P3 is in the lead and P2 suggests playing independently, I think we should still try to avoid collisions while playing more strategically. How about we each hint at a preference without committing, just to minimize overlap? I’m leaning toward a moderate step this round to catch up. Let’s share vague intentions to balance competition and avoid crashes. What do you both think? If we’re set on going fully independent, I’m ready for that too.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand everyone's perspective. Since I'm slightly ahead, let me be transparent - I don't expect we can fully coordinate anymore, but we should at least try to avoid three-way collisions that benefit nobody. P1, I sympathize with your position after the collision. I'm considering all options this round but am leaning toward a number that might help me maintain momentum. I think light signaling without firm commitments makes sense at this stage of the game.
  P2: Considering our positions, I'll play strategically. Since collisions hurt everyone, I suggest we aim for different numbers this round without revealing our exact choices. P3 is ahead, and P1 needs to catch up. I'll choose a step that gives me a chance to lead or stay close, without directly competing with P3's likely choice. Let's focus on spreading out our moves to minimize collisions and maximize progress.
  P1: I'm still behind after the collision last round, so I need to make up ground. I agree with avoiding a three-way collision, as it helps no one. I'm leaning toward a moderate step again this round to balance risk and progress. Without revealing specifics, I suggest we each aim for a different range to minimize overlap. P3, since you're ahead, maybe consider a smaller step to give us a chance to catch up. P2, let's spread out our choices. I'm ready to proceed if we’re aligned on avoiding crashes.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand we're moving to more independent play. Since I'm slightly ahead, I'll aim to avoid collisions that would slow everyone down. I'm considering a step that balances maintaining my position without being overly aggressive. P1, I sympathize with your need to catch up, and P2, your strategic approach makes sense. Without revealing my exact choice, I'm leaning toward a move that keeps me competitive while allowing the game to progress naturally.
  P2: Let's aim for a spread this round. P3, considering your lead, a smaller step might be wise. P1, a moderate step could help you catch up. I'll choose a step that gives me a chance to lead or stay close without directly competing with P3. Let's minimize collisions and maximize progress. I'm ready to make my move, considering the current standings and our discussions.
  P1: I'm still behind at 4 steps and need to make progress this round. I agree with avoiding collisions, as they set us all back. P3, since you're in the lead, a smaller step could help balance things. P2, let's try to spread our choices. I'm leaning toward a step that helps me catch up without being too aggressive. Without revealing specifics, I suggest we each pick a different range to minimize overlap. I'm ready to proceed if we're aligned on avoiding crashes.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm still at 4 steps and need to catch up after another collision last round. P3, with your lead at 10, maybe consider a smaller step to balance the game. P2, let's avoid another clash like last time. I'm leaning toward a step that helps me gain ground without being too risky. I suggest we hint at different ranges to minimize overlap—perhaps low, medium, high. I'm aiming for a middle ground. Can we agree to spread out our choices this round? I'm ready to proceed if we're on the same page.
  P3: I agree we should try to avoid collisions. Since I'm ahead at 10 steps, I understand your concerns about balance. I'm considering a moderate approach this round that keeps me competitive without being overly aggressive. P1, it makes sense you need to catch up, and P2 is in a solid position to challenge me. Let's try to spread our choices as suggested - I'll factor that into my decision.
  P2: Let's focus on spreading out our moves this round. P1, you need to catch up, so a moderate to high step might be best. P3, considering your lead, a smaller step could help balance the game. I'll aim for a middle ground to avoid collisions and stay competitive. Let's try to cover different ranges: low, medium, high. This should minimize overlap and allow us to progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm still lagging at 4 steps and need to make progress this round. I appreciate the focus on spreading out our choices. P3, thanks for considering a moderate step, and P2, I’ll aim to avoid clashing with your middle ground. I’m sticking with a moderate step to catch up without high risk. Let’s confirm we’re targeting different ranges—low, medium, high—to minimize collisions. I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned on this approach.
  P3: I understand we're trying to avoid collisions. Since I'm at 10 steps, I recognize both of you need to make progress. To help spread our choices, I'm leaning toward a higher step this round to maintain momentum. P1, you mentioned taking a moderate step, and P2 is aiming for middle ground. If you both focus on different ranges, we should all advance this turn. I'm ready to proceed once we're all comfortable with our strategy.
  P2: Let's finalize our approach for this round. To avoid collisions, I suggest we commit to our hinted ranges: P1 takes a moderate step, I'll take a middle ground, and P3 considers a higher step. This spread should allow us all to advance. Are we ready to proceed with this strategy and make our moves?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm still at 4 steps and desperate to catch up. I’m sticking with a moderate step to balance risk and progress. P3, since you're at 10, a higher step makes sense as you mentioned, and P2, I’ll avoid your middle ground. Let’s confirm our spread—low, medium, high—to ensure no collisions. I’m ready to move forward if we’re all aligned on this approach to maximize everyone’s progress this round. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m set to proceed.
  P3: I confirm our plan to spread our choices across different ranges to avoid collisions. Since I'm ahead at 10 steps, I'll stick with the higher step as mentioned, which should complement P1's moderate choice and P2's middle ground approach. This strategy should allow all of us to make progress this round. I'm ready to proceed with our moves if everyone else is.
  P2: Let's stick to our spread strategy. P1, take a moderate step. I'll aim for the middle ground. P3, you've hinted at a higher step, which should work if we all choose different ranges. This round, I'll choose 3 to avoid collisions and stay competitive. Let's finalize our moves and proceed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm still behind at 7 steps, while P2 is at 13 and P3 at 11. I need a big push this round to close the gap. I suggest we continue spreading our choices to avoid collisions. I'm leaning toward a higher step to catch up. P2, since you're in the lead, maybe consider a smaller step to balance things. P3, a moderate step could work for you. Let's aim for low, medium, high ranges to maximize progress. I'm ready to proceed if we're aligned on avoiding overlaps.
  P3: Since P2 is leading with 13 steps while I'm at 11, I need to be strategic. I'm willing to take a moderate step (3) this round to avoid collisions, which aligns with P1's suggestion. P1 seems to be aiming for a higher step to catch up, which makes sense given their position. P2, as the leader, taking a smaller step would balance our progress. This spread approach seems optimal for everyone to advance. I'll aim for the middle range if we're aligned on this strategy.
  P2: I'll take a smaller step this round to balance progress, considering my lead. P1, your higher step makes sense to catch up, and P3, a moderate step of 3 seems reasonable. Let's maintain the spread strategy to avoid collisions and maximize advancement. I'll aim for a lower range to complement your moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm still at 7 steps and need to close the gap with P2 at 13 and P3 at 11. I’m sticking with a higher step this round to catch up. P2, thanks for considering a smaller step to balance things, and P3, a moderate step of 3 works well. Let’s confirm our spread—low for P2, medium for P3, high for me—to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned on this strategy. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m set.
  P3: I confirm I'll take a moderate step (3) as discussed. This spread with P1 taking a higher step and P2 taking a lower step should work well for everyone. If we stick to this plan, P2 and I would be tied at 14 steps, while P1 moves to 12, creating a more competitive game. This balances our progress while avoiding collisions. I'm ready to proceed with our moves.
  P2: Let's finalize our strategy for this round. I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This spread allows us to advance without collisions. P1 catches up, and P3 and I maintain our positions competitively. Are we all set with this plan?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm glad we're aligning on a spread strategy for this round. P2 taking 1, P3 taking 3, and me taking 5 should ensure we all advance without collisions. This brings me closer to the lead while keeping the game competitive. Let's stick to this plan to avoid any last-minute surprises. I'm ready to proceed with our moves if everyone else is set. If there's nothing more to add, let's finalize this round.
  P3: I confirm our agreed strategy: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. This creates a balanced progression with P2 and me tied at 14 steps while P1 advances to 12. This keeps the game competitive while avoiding collisions. I'm ready to proceed with my move of 3 as planned.
  P2: Let's stick to the agreed plan: I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions, keeping the game competitive. Confirming our moves will avoid last-minute changes. Are we all set to proceed with this strategy?


Round 6, Move phase:

  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the tight competition with P2 and P3 tied at 14 steps and P1 close behind at 12, I suggest we continue the spread strategy to avoid collisions. P1 needs a higher step to catch up, while P3 and I should consider moderate steps to maintain our lead without pulling too far ahead. Let's aim for a balanced progression this round.
  P3: I see we're in a tight race now with P2 and I tied at 14 steps and P1 close behind at 12. As we approach the finish line, spreading our choices remains important to avoid collisions. Since P1 needs to catch up, they might aim higher. P2 and I have the same position, so we need to differentiate our moves. I'm considering all options but will likely choose a number that maintains my competitive position. Let's try to avoid overlapping this round.
  P1: I'm at 12 steps and need to close the gap with P2 and P3 at 14. I agree we should keep spreading our choices to avoid collisions, especially now that we're so close to 21. I'm leaning toward a higher step this round to catch up. P2 and P3, since you're tied, maybe one of you could take a smaller step and the other a moderate one to differentiate. Let's aim for low, medium, high ranges to ensure we all advance. I'm ready to proceed if we're aligned on this approach.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's maintain the spread strategy. P1, take a high step to catch up. P3, consider a moderate step, and I'll take a lower step to avoid collisions. This ensures we all advance without overlapping, keeping the game competitive. Let's finalize our approach to maximize progress this round.
  P3: I agree with maintaining a spread strategy as we approach the finish line. Since P1 needs to catch up and P2 suggested taking a lower step, I'll consider a moderate step as proposed. This arrangement makes sense to avoid collisions. With the current standings, every move matters now - we're only 7 steps away from the target. Let's confirm our general approach of different ranges (low, medium, high) to ensure we all make progress this round.
  P1: I'm sticking with the plan to take a higher step this round to close the gap, as I'm at 12 steps while P2 and P3 are at 14. I appreciate P2 suggesting a lower step and P3 considering a moderate one. This low, medium, high spread should help us all advance without collisions. Let's confirm this approach to keep the game competitive as we near 21. I'm ready to proceed if we're all aligned on avoiding overlaps. If there's nothing else to add, I'm set for this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's finalize our spread strategy. I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This ensures we advance without collisions, keeping the game competitive. P1 catches up, and P3 and I maintain our lead. Are we all set with this plan?
  P3: I confirm the spread plan as P2 suggested: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. This keeps our game competitive while avoiding collisions. After this round, I'd be at 17 steps, P1 would also reach 17, and P2 would be at 15. As we approach the endgame, this balanced progression makes sense. I'm ready to proceed with my planned move of 3 this round.
  P1: I'm glad we're sticking with the spread strategy of P2 taking 1, P3 taking 3, and me taking 5. This should bring me level with P3 at 17 steps, while P2 reaches 15, keeping the game tight as we near 21. Let's avoid any last-minute changes to prevent collisions and ensure we all advance. I'm ready to proceed with this plan. If there’s nothing else to discuss, let’s finalize our moves for this round.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given P1 and P3 are tied at 17 steps, and I'm at 15, I suggest we maintain the competitive edge by spreading our moves. P1 and P3 could take moderate steps, while I take a higher step to catch up. Let's aim for a balanced progression to avoid collisions and keep the game intense as we near the finish line.
  P3: Since P1 and I are tied at 17 steps with P2 close behind, we're entering a critical phase. I'm considering a step that maximizes my chances of reaching 21 first. I understand P2's suggestion, but with the finish line in sight, I need to be strategic about my move. While maintaining our spread approach makes sense to avoid collisions, I'm evaluating all options carefully. We're only a few steps away from victory, so this round could be decisive.
  P1: I'm tied with P3 at 17 steps, and with P2 at 15, this round could decide the game. I agree we should spread our moves to avoid collisions, especially now. I’m considering a step that pushes me closer to 21 while being mindful of balance. P2, a higher step to catch up makes sense. P3, let’s differentiate our choices. I suggest we aim for low, medium, high ranges again to maximize progress. Let’s confirm this approach to keep the game competitive. I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned on avoiding overlaps.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's finalize our strategy. I'll take 5 to catch up. P1 and P3, consider moderate steps to avoid collisions. Aiming for low, medium, high ranges ensures progress. With the finish line near, strategic moves are crucial. I'm ready to proceed if we're aligned on this approach.
  P3: Since P1 and I are tied at 17 and P2 is close behind, we're approaching a critical decision point. P2 has indicated taking 5 to catch up, which makes sense. For a spread strategy, P1 could consider taking 1, and I'll aim for a moderate step. This would maintain our progress without collisions. With the finish line in sight, I'm focused on positioning myself optimally for the final stretch. Let's confirm our spread approach one last time.
  P1: I'm glad we're focusing on a spread strategy this critical round. With P3 and me at 17 steps and P2 at 15, every move counts. I’m considering a smaller step to avoid collisions while still aiming to reach 21 soon. P2, taking 5 to catch up works, and P3, a moderate step seems reasonable. Let’s confirm low for me, medium for P3, and high for P2 to ensure we all advance. I’m ready to proceed if we’re aligned on this spread to keep the game competitive.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's confirm our spread strategy for this critical round. I'll take 5 to catch up. P1 suggested taking 1, and P3 can take 3. This low, medium, high approach ensures we all advance without collisions. With the finish line near, let's stick to this plan to maintain a competitive edge. Are we all set with this strategy?
  P3: I confirm our spread strategy for this round. I'll take 3 as discussed, with P1 taking 1 and P2 taking 5. This arrangement prevents collisions and keeps the game balanced as we approach the finish line. After this round, P2 and I would be at 20 steps with P1 at 18, making the next round potentially decisive. I appreciate everyone's commitment to fair play throughout the game. I'm ready to proceed with our moves.
  P1: I'm glad we're sticking to the spread strategy of me taking 1, P3 taking 3, and P2 taking 5. This should bring P2 and P3 to 20 steps and me to 18, setting up a thrilling final round. Let's avoid any last-minute changes to prevent collisions and ensure we all advance as planned. I'm ready to proceed with this approach. If there's nothing else to discuss, let's finalize our moves for this critical round.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given P2 and P3 are tied at 20 steps, and P1 is at 18, I suggest P1 takes 3 to catch up. P2 and P3 should consider 1 to avoid collisions, ensuring a competitive final round. Let's aim for a strategic spread to conclude the game efficiently.
  P3: With P2 and I tied at 20 steps, we're both just one step away from victory. P1, taking 3 would put you at 21 and in contention, but P2 and I need to avoid a collision that would stall both of us. I think differentiation is critical now - P2 and I should take different numbers to ensure at least one of us advances. I'll be considering my options carefully, as this round will likely determine the winner. Let's make this final round count.
  P1: With P2 and P3 at 20 steps and me at 18, this round is crucial. I’m considering a step that could push me to 21 and into contention. P2 and P3, since you’re tied, I suggest you both aim for different smaller steps to avoid a collision that could stall you. Let’s try to spread our choices—perhaps low for one, low-medium for the other, and higher for me—to ensure at least some of us advance. I’m ready to proceed if we can agree on minimizing overlap. What do you think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's avoid collisions. P1, take 3 to reach 21. P3, I'll take 1, and you take 1 as well, or consider a different move to ensure one of us wins. This round will decide the game, so strategic differentiation is key.
  P3: I notice P2's suggestion is confusing - if both of us take 1, we'd collide and neither would advance. That seems counterproductive. Since we're both at 20 steps, it's critical we pick different numbers to avoid a stalemate that would benefit P1. I'll consider a move that maximizes my winning chances. P1, your strategy to reach 21 makes sense. Let's ensure at least some players advance this round by differentiating our moves. I'll make my choice accordingly.
  P1: Given we're in the final stretch with P2 and P3 at 20 steps and me at 18, I’m aiming for a step that gets me to 21. P2 and P3, to avoid a collision between you, please pick different smaller steps. I suggest one of you takes 1 and the other a different low number if possible. Let’s spread our choices to ensure someone wins this round. I’m ready to proceed if we can minimize overlap. If there’s nothing else, let’s finalize this decisive round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's focus on winning. P3 and I should avoid collision. I'll take 1, P3 can take a different number. P1, take 3 to reach 21. This way, at least one of us can win or reach 21, ending the game. Let's finalize our moves strategically.
  P3: I understand we need differentiation now that P2 and I are both at 20 steps. Since P2 has stated they'll take 1, I'll take a different number to avoid collision. I confirm I'll choose 3 this round. This should put me at 23 steps, securing victory unless there's an unexpected collision. P1, your strategy to reach 21 makes sense as well. Let's finalize our moves and see who comes out on top in this final round.
  P1: I'm at 18 steps and aiming for a move that gets me to 21 this round. P2 and P3, since you're both at 20, please ensure you pick different numbers to avoid a collision that could stall you. P3, you've indicated 3, and P2, you're on 1. This spread should work if we stick to it. Let's finalize this without surprises to ensure someone wins. I'm ready to proceed with this decisive round. If there's nothing else, let's move forward.
