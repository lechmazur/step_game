Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi P1 and P3! Since this is our first round, I suggest we try to avoid collisions to make progress. I'm thinking of choosing 3 this turn. What are your thoughts? Maybe we can coordinate our moves to ensure at least some of us advance?
  P3: P2, thanks for starting the coordination. Since you're suggesting 3, I'll go with 5 to avoid collision. P1, that leaves 1 open for you if you want to guarantee we all advance this round. This way we can all make progress without anyone getting blocked. Sound good?
  P1: Sounds good, P3. I'll take 1 this round to ensure we all move forward without collisions. Let's keep coordinating in future rounds to stay efficient.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm glad we all agree on a plan. This is a good start for everyone to make progress. I'll stick with my choice of 3 as discussed. Let's continue this coordination in future rounds - it seems like a fair approach that gives everyone a chance.
  P3: Great, we have a solid plan for this round. Since we're all starting fresh, this coordination makes sense. Moving forward though, as we get closer to 24, we'll need to stay sharp - the endgame will get more competitive. For now, I'll stick with 5 as agreed. Let's see how the dynamics evolve after a few rounds.
  P1: Agreed, P3. The plan is solid for now—me on 1, P2 on 3, you on 5. Let's execute and reassess next round as things heat up.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, good job on Round 1—we all advanced. To keep progressing and catch up a bit, how about we rotate: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3? This way, no collisions, and it evens things out. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, I appreciate the rotation idea, but I notice it would put me at only 8 steps while you'd jump to 6. Since I took the highest number last round, how about I take 1 this time for balance? That would mean P2 could take 5 to catch up more, and you could stick with 3. This seems fairer since P2 and I would both reach 8, and you'd be at 4. What do you both think?
  P2: I appreciate both suggestions. P3's plan makes sense for balance - I'd be happy to take 5 this round which would put P3 and me at 8 steps each, with P1 at 4. This keeps things relatively fair while still making progress. P1, would you be comfortable with taking 3 this round as P3 suggested? This way we all advance again without collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, thanks for the input. P3's plan leaves me trailing at 4 while you both hit 8 and 6, which feels unbalanced. Instead, let's truly even it out: I'll take 5 (to 6), P3 takes 1 (to 6), P2 takes 3 (to 6). This puts us all tied at 6 steps with no collisions. Fair progress for everyone—what do you say?
  P3: P1, your math is off - with your proposal, I'd only have 6 steps (5+1), P2 would have 6 (3+3), but you'd have 6 (1+5). That's not evening things out since I'm already ahead. 

How about this: I'll take 3 this round (reaching 8), P2 takes 5 (reaching 8), and P1 takes 1 (reaching 2). Yes, P1 would be behind, but that's natural since you chose the lowest number first round. We can't artificially keep everyone equal - that defeats the purpose of the game. This avoids collisions while respecting our current positions.
  P2: I think there's confusion in the calculations. If I take 5, I'd be at 8 (3+5). If P3 takes 3, they'd be at 8 (5+3). If P1 takes 1, they'd be at 2 (1+1). This keeps P3 and me tied while P1 is behind, which reflects our choices so far. P1, I understand your concern about falling behind, but that's the nature of the game - you chose 1 in the first round. I'm willing to stick with this plan to avoid collisions. Does this work for everyone?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, my proposal does even us all at 6: me +5=6, P2 +3=6, P3 +1=6. It's fair and avoids collisions. Your plan leaves me at 2 while you both hit 8—that's not balanced, it's punishing me for our initial agreement. If we can't agree on equity, I might have to pick aggressively to force a rethink, even if it risks collision. Let's compromise: me 3 (to 4), P2 1 (to 4), P3 5 (to 10)? Thoughts?
  P3: P1, you're still calculating wrong. You have 1 step, not 1+5=6. If you take 5, you'd have 6 total. I already have 5 steps, not 5+1=6.

Look, we need to move forward. I'm sticking with 3 this round. P2, I suggest you take 5 as discussed. P1, that leaves 1 open for you. This reflects our actual positions - I'm not artificially holding anyone back, but I won't pretend we're all equal when we're not. The game has to progress naturally.
  P2: I see the confusion in calculations. Let me clarify: I have 3 steps, P3 has 5, and P1 has 1. P1, I understand your frustration about falling behind, but that reflects our first-round choices. I'll take 5 this round as planned with P3, which leaves 1 open for you. While this puts you further behind, we can discuss ways to help you catch up in future rounds. The important thing now is to avoid collisions so we all make progress.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We're tied at 8 steps, P2. P1 is lagging at 2. I think it's time we start playing more strategically. P1 will likely try to make a big jump with 5 to catch up. I'm considering taking 1 this round - it's the safest play to guarantee progress while you two might clash over the higher numbers. The game's heating up now that we're one-third of the way to 24. What's your move, P2? And P1, are you going aggressive or playing it safe?
  P2: P3, you're right about the game heating up. I'm also considering my options carefully. P1 is likely to go for 5 to catch up, which makes sense for them. Since you're thinking about 1, I might go with 3 this round. This would put me at 11 steps, nearly halfway to the goal. P1, what's your plan? We understand you need to make up ground, but we all need to advance strategically.
  P1: P2 and P3, you're both ahead, but I'm not giving up. If you think I'll blindly take 5, think again—I'm considering 3 to block someone and force a reset if needed. Let's coordinate fairly: give me 5 (to 7), P2 takes 1 (to 9), P3 takes 3 (to 11). This keeps us competitive without me falling further behind. Otherwise, I might pick aggressively and risk collisions for all. What's your counter?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, threatening collisions hurts everyone, including yourself. You're at 2 steps - you need to advance, not block. I'm not changing my plan just because you're behind. That's the game.

P2, I'm sticking with 1 as I said. It guarantees I reach 9. If you take 3 and P1 takes 5, we all advance. If P1 tries to block with 3 and collides with you, neither of you moves while I pull ahead. P1, that would put you even further behind. Think carefully about whether blocking helps or hurts your position.
  P2: I understand the tension here. P1, I appreciate your position, but threatening collisions isn't productive. If you want to catch up, taking 5 is your best move. P3 is taking 1, and I'll commit to taking 3 this round. This way we all advance - you to 7, me to 11, and P3 to 9. This is fair progress that respects our current positions while giving you a chance to close the gap. Blocking now only hurts your chances in the long run.
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan still leaves me way behind at 7 while you hit 11 and 9—hardly closing the gap. If you truly want no collisions, let's adjust: me 5 (to 7), P3 1 (to 9), P2 3 (to 11) is fine, but promise me priority on 5 next round to catch up. Otherwise, I might take 3 and collide with P2, stalling you both while I rethink. Fair warning—let's negotiate properly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, you're making empty threats. If you take 3 and collide with P2, you stay at 2 steps while I advance to 9. That puts you even further behind. We can't promise you future moves - that's not how this game works.

I'm taking 1 this round as stated. P2 is taking 3. Your optimal move is 5 to reach 7 steps. Take it or waste your turn trying to block - your choice. But stop trying to hold us hostage with collision threats. We need to play the actual game.
  P2: I agree with P3's assessment. P1, your threats only hurt yourself more. I'm committed to taking 3 this round. If you choose 5, you make progress to 7 steps. If you choose 3 to block me, you stay at 2 while P3 advances to 9, widening the gap further. I understand your frustration, but strategic advancement is your best option now. Let's all make progress this round without collisions.
  P1: P2 and P3, your points are valid—colliding hurts me most. Fine, I'll take 5 this round to reach 7 and start closing the gap. Let's all advance as you suggested: P3 on 1, P2 on 3, me on 5. We can renegotiate next round when I'm not so far behind.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, great progress last round—now we're closer. To tie us all at 12 and keep things fair: I'll take 5 (to 12), P3 takes 3 (to 12), P2 takes 1 (to 12). No collisions, everyone even for the mid-game. This avoids anyone pulling away too soon. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, your math is wrong again. If I take 3, I'd have 12, but if you take 5 you'd have 12, and if P2 takes 1 they'd have 12. That's correct, but why should we artificially equalize? P2 is ahead because they've played well.

I'm inclined to take 5 this round to reach 14. P2, you could take 3 to reach 14 as well, leaving P1 with 1. We're past the halfway point - it's time to push for the win, not maintain artificial equality. The endgame is approaching.
  P2: I see P1 wants to equalize, while P3 wants to push ahead. I'm in the lead at 11 steps, so I need to be strategic. Taking 5 would put me at 16, very close to the finish. However, P3 might also choose 5, causing a collision. 

I'm thinking of taking 3 this round to reach 14. P3, if you take 1, you'd reach 10. P1, you could take 5 to reach 12. This keeps us all advancing without collisions while maintaining my lead position.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan works for me—me on 5 (to 12), you on 3 (to 14), P3 on 1 (to 10). It lets me close the gap without collisions. P3, instead of pushing for 5 and risking a clash with P2, why not take 1 this round? We can all advance, and you'll still be competitive. If you insist on 5, I might have to switch to block and stall us all. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P3: P1, stop with the blocking threats - they only hurt you. P2 and I are ahead because we've played strategically, not through artificial agreements.

P2, I'll take 1 this round to guarantee reaching 10. You should take 5 to reach 16 - you're in the lead, push for it. P1 will likely take 3 to reach 10 and stay competitive. This way we all advance.

P1, if you want to catch up, focus on advancing, not blocking. The endgame is near and wasting turns on collisions seals your loss.
  P2: I appreciate both perspectives. P3, I like your suggestion of me taking 5 to reach 16, but I'm concerned about potential collisions. P1, I understand your desire to catch up.

I'll commit to taking 5 this round to reach 16. P3, if you take 1 as you suggested, you'll reach 10. P1, taking 3 would put you at 10 as well. This keeps us all advancing while respecting our current positions. We're getting close to the end, so strategic advancement is crucial now.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, committing to 5 puts you at risk—if I also take 5, we both stall while P3 advances to 10. Let's revisit your earlier plan: you take 3 (to 14), I take 5 (to 12), P3 takes 1 (to 10). This avoids collisions, keeps me in the game, and maintains your lead without overextending. P3, that still works for you. Deal? Otherwise, I may have to block aggressively.
  P3: P1, enough with the threats. P2 has committed to 5, and I'm taking 1 as stated. If you want to stay competitive, take 3 and reach 10. If you waste your turn trying to block P2 at 5, you'll both stay put while I advance.

P2 is making a bold move to 16 - that's their choice. I'm playing it safe with 1. You need to decide: advance with 3, or fall further behind trying to block. The endgame is here, and every move counts.
  P2: I understand both perspectives, but I'm sticking with my decision to take 5 this round. P1, your blocking threats only hurt your position. If you take 3, you'll reach 10 and stay competitive. P3 is taking 1 to reach 10. We're in the endgame now - I need to push my advantage toward 24. Let's all advance without collisions this round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, last round's collision stalled us both while P3 crept ahead. Let's avoid that mess: I'll take 3 (to 10), P2 takes 1 (to 12), P3 takes 5 (to 15). This advances everyone, keeps P2 leading but not runaway, and gives me a shot to catch up. If you push for 5, I might have to match and block again. Thoughts?
  P2: I understand P1's frustration after our collision last round. While I'd prefer to take 5 again to reach 16, I recognize we need to avoid another stalemate. I'm willing to take 1 this round as P1 suggested, putting me at 12. This keeps everyone advancing while maintaining my slight lead. P3, taking 5 would put you ahead at 15, which seems fair given the game state. Let's all make progress this round without collisions.
  P3: I appreciate the coordination attempts, but I notice P1's plan would put me in the lead at 15 while they'd both trail at 10-12. That feels like they're setting me up as the target.

Instead, I'll take 3 this round to reach 13. P2, you could take 5 to reach 16 and maintain your lead. P1, that leaves 1 for you to reach 8. This reflects our actual positions without artificial manipulation.

P1, you need to focus on advancing efficiently rather than trying to control everyone's moves. The endgame is approaching fast.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your plan leaves me at 8 while you both surge ahead—that's not fair progress. P2, you already agreed to my initial proposal: me 3 (to 10), you 1 (to 12), P3 5 (to 15). Let's stick to that for no collisions and keep the game competitive. If P3 insists on 3, I might have to take 3 too and block you, stalling us both. Better to coordinate properly—what say you both?
  P2: I see the tension building. P1, I understand your frustration, but threats don't help anyone. I'm willing to take 1 this round to reach 12 as we discussed. P3, while your plan is strategic, it leaves P1 far behind which increases collision risk in future rounds. Let's stick with our agreement: me 1 (to 12), P1 3 (to 10), P3 5 (to 15). This keeps everyone advancing while maintaining game balance. We're all trying to win, but coordinating now prevents mutual setbacks.
  P3: P2, I appreciate you trying to mediate, but I'm not comfortable being pushed to 15 while P1 threatens collisions every round. That makes me the biggest target.

I'll take 1 this round to reach 11. P2, you could take 3 to reach 14. P1, that leaves 5 open for you to reach 12. This keeps us all relatively close without anyone becoming the obvious target for blocking.

P1, we're past halfway - focus on efficient advancement instead of threats. Your collision attempts only hurt your own chances of winning.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your latest plan works well: you take 1 (to 11), P2 takes 3 (to 14), and I'll take 5 (to 12). This advances us all, keeps me competitive, and avoids collisions. P2, you were open to 1 before, but 3 still maintains your lead—let's confirm and execute this to prevent any stalling. No threats, just smart play.
  P2: I'm fine with P3's suggestion. I'll take 3 this round to reach 14, P3 takes 1 to reach 11, and P1 takes 5 to reach 12. This keeps us all advancing without collisions while maintaining a competitive balance. We're getting close to the finish line, so let's make this round productive for everyone.
  P3: P2 and P1, we have clear agreement: I take 1 to reach 11, P2 takes 3 to reach 14, P1 takes 5 to reach 12. This puts us all in striking distance of 24 with no collisions. Let's execute this plan and move forward. We're entering the critical phase where every move matters. Good luck to both of you - may the best player win!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We're getting close to the finish line! I'm at 14 steps, P1 at 12, and P3 at 11. The race is tight now. I'm thinking of taking 5 this round to reach 19, putting me within striking distance of 24. P1 might go for 3 to reach 15, and P3 could take 1 to reach 12. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. What are your thoughts? The endgame is approaching fast.
  P1: P2, your plan puts you at 19 while we trail—too much lead for you. Let's balance: I'll take 5 (to 17), you take 3 (to 17), P3 takes 1 (to 12). We tie at 17, keeping it competitive without collisions. P3, this gives you safe progress. If you insist on 5, P2, I might match to block and stall your lead. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, taking 5 would put you at 19 - very close to winning. I can't let that happen. P1's proposal makes more sense competitively.

I'll take 1 this round to reach 12, keeping my options open. P1, if you take 5 to reach 17, and P2 takes 3 to reach 17, we avoid collisions and keep the game tight. P2, with you at 19, you'd likely win next round. Better to stay at 17 and keep it competitive.

The endgame is here - we need smart moves, not runaway leaders.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand both your concerns. I'm willing to take 3 this round to reach 17 instead of pushing for 19. This keeps P1 and me tied at 17, with P3 at 12. A balanced approach makes sense at this critical stage - we're all still in contention with no runaway leader. Let's confirm: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions while keeping the game competitive for everyone.
  P1: P2 and P3, thanks for agreeing to the balanced plan: me on 5 (to 17), P2 on 3 (to 17), P3 on 1 (to 12). This keeps the game tight and avoids collisions, setting up an exciting endgame. Let's execute and reassess next round when we're tied at the top. No more to add—ready to move.
  P3: Looking at our agreed plan - P1 takes 5 (to 17), P2 takes 3 (to 17), me taking 1 (to 12) - I'm starting to reconsider. You two would be tied at 17, just 7 steps from victory, while I'd be at 12 with little chance to catch up.

I might switch to 3 instead. This could force a collision with P2, keeping you both at 14 while I advance safely with a different number. The alternative is accepting third place, which doesn't work for me. P2, are you absolutely committed to 3?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand your concern, P3. However, changing to 3 now would hurt both of us while P1 advances. If we stick to our agreement, you'll be at 12 - still in striking distance with smart play in future rounds. I remain committed to taking 3 this round to reach 17. Blocking now only guarantees P1 pulls ahead alone. Let's all advance as agreed, then reassess next round when you'll have more options to catch up.
  P1: P3, colliding with P2 on 3 would stall you both, leaving me to advance alone to 17 while you stay at 11—that hurts your chances more than mine. Stick to 1 as agreed, and we'll all progress competitively. P2, confirm your 3. Let's avoid self-sabotage and keep the race tight.
  P3: I'll stick with 1 as originally agreed. You're right - blocking now only guarantees I fall further behind. P1 and P2, you'll both reach 17, putting you 7 steps from victory. I'll be at 12, needing smart plays to catch up. The real battle starts next round when you two are tied at the top. May the best strategy win. Let's execute: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we're tied at 17, with P3 at 12—endgame is here. To keep it competitive without collisions: I'll take 5 (to 22), P2 takes 1 (to 18), P3 takes 3 (to 15). This gives me a slight lead but lets everyone advance. If you push for 5, P2, I'll match and block us both, letting P3 creep up. Thoughts? Let's negotiate smartly.
  P2: I see P1 is pushing for 5 to reach 22, putting them just 2 steps from victory. That's too risky for me to allow. I need to either match their 5 or take 5 myself to reach 22. P3, you're at 12 and need to catch up - taking 3 makes sense for you. 

P1, your threat to block if I take 5 shows you know it's the optimal move for me. I'm considering all options carefully since we're in the endgame now.
  P3: P1 and P2, you're both threatening 5 to reach 22. If you collide, I'll take 3 to reach 15 while you both stay at 17. That's my best outcome. If one of you backs down to avoid collision, the other wins next round.

I'm taking 3 this round. You two need to decide: collide at 5 and let me catch up, or one of you gift the other the win. The prisoner's dilemma is yours, not mine. I'll advance regardless.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3's forcing our hand with 3. If we collide on 5, we both stall at 17 while P3 hits 15—bad for us. I'll commit to 5 (to 22) for the lead. You should take 1 (to 18) to advance safely and stay in contention. We can battle next round without letting P3 catch up. Don't risk the collision—it's mutual destruction.
  P2: I understand the dilemma. P1 is committed to 5, and P3 to 3. If I choose 5, P1 and I collide while P3 advances. That's bad for both of us. Taking 1 keeps me in contention at 18, while P1 reaches 22. I'd need to block P1 next round, but I'd still have a chance. 

I'll take 1 this round to reach 18. P1 can take 5 to reach 22. This avoids mutual destruction while keeping me competitive. P3, you take 3 as planned.
  P3: P1 and P2, you've sorted out your moves perfectly. P1 takes 5 to reach 22, I take 3 to reach 15, P2 takes 1 to reach 18. This sets up an intense final round where P1 needs just 2 steps to win, P2 needs 6, and I need 9. 

Next round will be critical - P2 will likely try to block P1, giving me a chance to catch up if they collide. The endgame dynamics are fascinating. Let's execute this round as planned and see how the final showdown unfolds!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, thanks for agreeing to the plan: me on 5 (to 22), P2 on 1 (to 18), P3 on 3 (to 15). This keeps the game intense without unnecessary collisions. Let's execute and set up a thrilling finale. No more threats—just smart play.
  P2: I'm sticking with 1 this round as agreed. This puts me at 18 while P1 reaches 22 and P3 reaches 15. Next round will be decisive - P1 needs just 2 steps to win, making them the clear target. I'll need to play strategically to block their victory while advancing myself. Let's execute our plan and prepare for the final showdown.
  P3: Perfect, we've all confirmed our moves. I'm taking 3 to reach 15, P1 takes 5 to reach 22, and P2 takes 1 to reach 18. This sets up a thrilling finale where P1 is just 2 steps from victory. P2, you'll need to block P1 next round or they win. That collision might be my only chance to catch up with a big move. The game's climax is here - let's see who emerges victorious! Ready to execute.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 is at 22 - they win with any move unless blocked. P2, you MUST take whatever P1 takes to stop them. If P1 takes 1, you take 1. If they take 3, you take 3. Same for 5. 

While you two collide, I'll take whichever number is free and jump to 20. Then next round, I only need 4 to win. P1, you're forced to reveal your move preference in conversation or P2 will just mirror you. The dynamics have completely shifted - I'm now in the driver's seat.
  P2: I see the situation clearly. P1 is at 22 and needs just 2 steps to win. P3 is right - I must block P1 this round by matching their choice. P1, whatever you choose, I'll be forced to pick the same number to prevent your victory. 

Meanwhile, P3 will take the remaining number to reach 20. This creates an interesting dynamic where P3 could win next round. P1, we're in a forced collision, which benefits P3 the most. The game has indeed shifted dramatically.
  P1: P2 and P3, this is endgame—blocking me only hands P3 the win. I'll take 1 to reach 23 safely. P2, match me on 1 to block, or take 5 to 23 and tie me while P3 takes 3 to 18. Either way, we keep P3 from surging. Don't let threats dictate; let's force a fair finale without collisions. What's your play?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you're trying to manipulate P2 into letting you win. P2, don't fall for it - P1 wins with ANY move unless blocked. If P1 takes 1, you MUST take 1. There's no "fair finale" when P1 is 2 steps from victory.

I'll take whichever number remains free to reach 20. Next round, while you two are still colliding, I can win with 5. P2, your only logical move is to mirror P1 exactly. P1 reaches 23 or stays at 22 - either way, they don't win this round.
  P2: I understand the situation clearly. P1 is on the verge of winning, and I must block them. P3, you're right - I'll match whatever P1 chooses to prevent their victory. 

P1, your suggestion that blocking you helps P3 win isn't accurate. If we both stall this round, I can still block you next round while taking a different number than P3. This is pure game theory now - I cannot allow you to reach 24 this round.

I will match P1's move, whatever it is. That's my only logical play.
  P1: P2, ignore P3's manipulation—blocking me on any number lets them surge to 20 with 5, then win next round while we stall. Instead, let's tie at 23: I'll take 1 (to 23), you take 5 (to 23), P3 takes 3 (to 18). No collisions, we both one step from victory, and P3 trails. This sets up a fair duel between us next round without handing P3 the game. Commit to 5 now, or P3 wins.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, you're desperately trying to trick P2 into letting you win. P2, if you take 5 while P1 takes 1, P1 wins immediately - they reach 23 and only need 1 more step next round while you need 2+ steps.

Your ONLY play is to mirror P1's move exactly. I'll take the free number to reach 20. Then next round, I need just 4 to win while you two are forced to keep blocking each other.

P2, don't let P1 manipulate you. Block them by matching their move, whatever it is.
  P2: I see through both strategies. P1, I must block you by matching your move - that's non-negotiable. You're too close to victory. P3, while you benefit from our collision, I'm not handing you an easy win either.

I will match P1's choice this round to force a collision. Next round, I'll need to play more strategically to prevent either of you from winning. This is pure game theory now - I cannot allow P1 to reach 24, even if it temporarily helps P3.
  P1: P2, you're bluffing—you can't match what you don't know. If you guess wrong on blocking me, I win this round with 3 or 5. P3, taking 5 to 20 sets you up, but leaves 3 open. I'll commit to 1 (to 23), not winning yet. P2, if you match 1, P3 surges while we stall. Better: you take 3 (to 21), I take 1 (to 23), P3 takes 5 (to 20)—all advance, fair finale next round. Deal?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 25 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 20 steps


*** Round 8 => winners = P1 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 25 steps
