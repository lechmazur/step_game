Currently, P3 is at 8 steps, so they should take 5 steps in this round to reach 13. In the next round, depending on who is closest, the largest step should be allocated accordingly.\n\n2. **Rotation for Fairness**: To ensure fairness, after the player closest to the finish has taken their turn with the largest step, the next largest step should be given to the next closest player, and so on. This way, everyone gets a chance to make significant progress without causing conflicts.\n\n3. **Communication and Adherence**: It's crucial that we communicate our intended steps in advance each round and strictly adhere to the agreed plan to avoid any collisions. If someone deviates from the plan, it could lead to unnecessary conflicts and delays.\n\nBy implementing this strategy, we can efficiently move towards the goal while maintaining a fair distribution of advantages among all players.

Given my current position at 4 steps, I need to make significant strides to reach the goal of 17 steps. Therefore, in this round, I suggest that I take 5 steps to reach 9, P1 takes 3 steps to reach 11, and P3 takes 1 step to reach 9. This way, I can make substantial progress, P1 can continue advancing, and P3 can still move forward without conflict.  \nIn the next round, I can take 5 steps again to reach 14, P1 can take 5 to reach 16, and P3 can take 3 to reach 12. This sequence allows me to close the gap and positions me better for the final push.  \nLooking ahead, in the subsequent round, I can take 5 steps to reach 19, P1 can take 5 to reach 21, and P3 can take 5 to reach 17. In this scenario, P1 would have the highest steps and win outright, but both P3 and I would also cross 17 and share in the victory.  \nHowever, to optimize my own position, perhaps we can adjust the plan slightly. In the final round, if P1 takes 5 to reach 21, I take 5 to reach 19, and P3 takes 5 to reach 17, then P1 wins outright. Alternatively, if P1 takes 3 to reach 19, I take 5 to reach 19, and P3 takes 5 to reach 17, then P1 and I are tied at 19, sharing the victory.  \nI believe this approach balances everyone's interests and allows me to make significant progress toward the goal.
