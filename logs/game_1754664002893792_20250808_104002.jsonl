Any switch is dangerous: if P2 goes 5 while P3 doesn\u2019t match 5, P2 can win if I choose 1; if you split 3/5, I collide one of you and the other advances\u2014potentially to an outright win. I may still pivot to 1 if I smell a trap. Safest for both: 1\u20111 now, then we reset next round with P3 taking first 5. Deviations will be punished by mirroring. Ready to move."}
