Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This way, we can all advance smoothly. What do you think?
  P3: I appreciate the suggestion, but I don't see why I should take 5 while others get shorter moves. How about I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5? That seems more fair to rotate the larger numbers.
  P1: To avoid collisions and ensure a smooth start, I propose that we follow a simple rotation. For this round, I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all move and get a good start. It's a straightforward distribution for the first round. Let's see if we can coordinate effectively from the beginning.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm open to rotating the numbers, but starting with 5 might put me at a disadvantage early on. How about we compromise? For this round, let's go with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 5. This way, we all move, and we can rotate from there. Fairness and a good start for everyone should be our goal. What do you say?
  P3: I'll agree to take 5 as suggested by P2. It gives me a good start, and we can rotate the numbers in future rounds to keep things fair. Let's stick to this plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5.
  P1: Since we've agreed on a plan for this round (P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5), let's think ahead. For Round 2, I suggest we rotate the numbers again to maintain fairness. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3? This rotation ensures we all get a different number each round. Let's confirm if this rotation works for everyone for the next round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with the rotation plan for Round 2. Let's stick to P1 taking 1, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 3. This ensures we continue to move forward without collisions. Looking ahead, we should keep rotating to maintain fairness. What are your thoughts on continuing this pattern for future rounds?

  P1: Since we've agreed on the moves for Round 1 (P1: 3, P2: 1, P3: 5) and planned the rotation for Round 2, let's confirm our understanding. For Round 2, P1 will take 1, P2 will take 5, and P3 will take 3. To further plan ahead, for Round 3, we should continue the rotation. I suggest P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the pattern consistent and ensures we avoid collisions in the subsequent rounds.
