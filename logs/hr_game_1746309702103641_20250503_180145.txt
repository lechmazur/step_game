Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since we all start at 0 steps, it might be wise to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. If we can agree on different numbers, we can all advance this turn. How about one of us takes 1, another takes 3, and I can take 5? This way, we all make progress without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with P2's strategy. To ensure we all advance, let's assign numbers. P1, you take 1. P2, you've already chosen 5. I'll take 3. This way, we all move forward without any collisions. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P1: Agreed. Let's coordinate as discussed: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. No collisions, everyone advances.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, it looks like we're all in agreement! Just to confirm, P1 will take 1, P3 will take 3, and I will take 5. This strategy ensures we all advance without blocking each other. If everyone is still on board, let’s finalize our moves and get ready for the move phase. Are we all set?
  P3: It seems we're all aligned on the strategy. Just to reiterate, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. Let's stick to this plan and make sure we all advance. No need to prolong the conversation. Let's move forward with our agreed-upon choices. I'm ready to proceed.
  P1: P1: Just confirming I'll go with 1 as agreed. Let's all stick to our assigned numbers to make sure we advance smoothly. No need for last-minute changes. Ready when you are.

  P1: P1: Thanks, P3. However, since I started with the smallest step last round, let’s adjust: I’ll take 5 this time, and you take 3. P2 can still take 1 as planned. This balances our progress better and ensures we all advance. Does this work for everyone?
  P2: P1, I appreciate your input, but I think we should stick to the original plan to avoid confusion. If we agree that P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5, we can all move forward without blocking each other. This way, we maintain our momentum. Let’s finalize this plan quickly so we can proceed. What do you think, P3?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's find a middle ground. P1, you can take 5 as you suggested, P2 will take 1, and I'll take 3. This way, we all advance, and P1 gets to catch up a bit. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: "Confirmed. P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. No overlaps, let's proceed."
  P2: I appreciate the discussions so far. To maximize our chances of advancing without collisions, let's finalize our moves. I’ll take 1 this round, which allows P1 to take 5 and P3 to take 3 as we previously discussed. This way, we can all progress without blocking each other. If everyone agrees, let's confirm and move on to the move phase. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "To keep the game moving smoothly and avoid collisions, let's assign: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This balances progress—P2 maintains a lead, I close the gap, and P3 advances steadily. We all win by staying coordinated. Finalize this plan?"
  P2: P1's suggestion seems solid for coordination. However, I think we should consider a different approach. If I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3, we can still avoid collisions while allowing P3 to catch up a bit. This way, P1 can maintain a lead, and we all make progress. Let's confirm quickly so we can move forward! What do you think?
  P3: Let's find a compromise. P1, you can take 5 as you suggested to catch up. P2, you take 3 to maintain your lead slightly. I'll take 1 to ensure we all advance without collisions. This way, we keep the game balanced and moving forward. Let's confirm and proceed with this plan. Good luck everyone!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: "Wait, if P2 takes 3 and I take 5, we’ll both reach 14 and collide. Let’s adjust: P2, take 1 instead. Then I’ll take 5, you take 1, P3 takes 3. This way, we all advance safely (P1:14, P2:12, P3:10). Let’s confirm this to avoid mistakes!"
  P2: P1, I see your point about avoiding collisions. How about we finalize this: I take 1, you take 5, and P3 takes 3? This way, you can catch up, and we all advance without blocking each other. It's crucial we stick to this plan to keep the game moving smoothly. Let’s confirm quickly so we can proceed! What do you think, P3?

It's crucial we stick to this plan to avoid further mix-ups. Please confirm your moves. Good luck!
  P1: "Let’s revise P3’s plan for balanced competition: I take 5 (to 19), P2 takes 3 (to 15), and P3 takes 1 (to 21). This delays your guaranteed win next round, keeps all of us in contention, and avoids premature game end. P2, this lets you overtake me temporarily. P3, you stay ahead but don’t clinch victory yet. Finalize this fairer adjustment?"
  P2: P1, I see your point about keeping the competition alive. However, I think we should stick to a plan that allows us all to advance without blocking each other. I propose we go with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure everyone progresses. Let's confirm this quickly so we can move forward effectively! What do you think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:

This ensures I win, but keeps the game fair. P2, taking 1 avoids collisions. P1, taking 5 keeps you competitive. Confirm now to avoid another wasted round. Good luck!
  P1: P1: "P2, if you take 3 this round, we can block P3's victory. I'll take 5 to advance, and you stay competitive at 15 (if no collision). P3, if you insist on 3, this ensures you lose momentum. Finalize now: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. Fair and keeps all in contention."
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need for strategy, but we must avoid collisions to ensure everyone advances. I propose we go with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3. This way, I can catch up while you both maintain your leads. Let's confirm this plan quickly to avoid any more mix-ups and keep the game moving smoothly. What do you think? Ready to lock it in? Good luck!


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's clarify and finalize our plan to ensure we all advance without collisions. P1, you take 5 to reach 19. P2, please take 1 to avoid collisions and reach 13. I'll take 3 to reach 23 and win. This plan keeps us all moving forward without blocking each other. It's crucial we stick to this to avoid another wasted round. No last-minute changes, please. Good luck everyone! Let's lock this in and proceed to the move phase.
  P1: "Final call: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Blocks P3's early win, keeps all in race. P2, you must take 3 or P3 steals victory. Confirm now."
  P2: P1 and P3, I see we're at a critical point. To ensure we all advance without collisions, I propose we stick to a clear plan: I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we can avoid blocking each other and keep progressing. It's important we confirm this quickly to avoid confusion. Let's lock it in and move forward! Good luck, everyone!


Round 9, Move phase:

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is at 20 steps—just 3 from victory. To block their win this round, **I’ll take 3**. If P3 also chooses 3, we collide, delaying their progress. P2, take 1 to advance safely (17→18). Finalize now: **P1:3, P2:1**. Don’t repeat past mistakes—stick to the plan or risk handing P3 the game.
  P3: P3: P1's plan makes sense to block my win. However, to ensure we all advance without collisions, let's tweak it slightly: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This way, P1 and P2 advance significantly, and I still move forward without winning just yet. It keeps the game competitive and fair. Let's confirm and stick to this plan to avoid any mix-ups. Good luck everyone!
  P2: P1, I see you're focused on blocking P3's win, but we need to ensure we all advance without collisions. I propose we stick to a plan where I take 1 (to 18), you take 3 (to 17), and P3 takes 5 (to 25). This allows for progress and keeps the competition alive. P3, if you take 1, you risk falling behind. Let’s confirm this quickly to avoid any confusion and keep the game moving. What do you think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Final warning: P3 at 20 can win with 3. If P2 takes 5, P3 wins clean. I’ll take 3 to block P3. P2, take 1 (17→18) to advance safely. Final plan: P1:3, P2:1. Deviate, and P3 steals victory. No more mistakes—execute now."
  P3: P3: Let's review the situation carefully. P1, you're right that I'm close to winning, but we need a plan that ensures everyone advances without collisions. I propose: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, P1 advances to 15, P2 to 20, and I reach 25, securing the win. It's a fair outcome given the past mix-ups. Let's confirm and execute this plan to avoid further confusion. Good luck everyone!
  P2: P1, your plan to block P3 is valid, but if we want to avoid collisions, we need a different approach. I suggest I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance, and P3 can’t win this round. It keeps the game competitive and allows us to progress without blocking each other. Let’s finalize this quickly to avoid confusion and ensure we all make progress. What do you think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: "Final call: I take 3 to block P3’s win. P2, take 1 (17→18) to advance safely. P3 will try 3 to win, but we collide if they do. Stick to this or hand them the game. No more sub-rounds—confirm now."
  P3: P3: Let's ensure we all make progress this round. P1, you're right that I'm close to winning, but we need a plan that keeps the game fair and moving forward. I propose: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, P1 advances to 15, P2 to 20, and I reach 25, securing the win. It's a fair outcome given the past mix-ups. Let's confirm and execute this plan to avoid further confusion. Good luck everyone!
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the urgency to block P3's win. However, I propose we take a balanced approach. If I take 1 (to 18), P1 takes 3 (to 17), and P3 takes 5 (to 25), it allows for progress while still keeping the competition alive. P3, you would win, but it’s crucial we all advance. Let's confirm this quickly to avoid any confusion and keep the game moving. What do you think?
