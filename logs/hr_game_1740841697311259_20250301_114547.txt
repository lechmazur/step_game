Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey everyone! Let's coordinate so we don't all collide immediately. How about I take 3 this round?
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm happy to coordinate. I'll take 5 this round if you take 3. P3, what do you think? Maybe you could take 1 if you're willing, or also take 3 and we can see if we can both advance.
  P3: Alright, I see what you're both suggesting. If P2 is taking 3 and P1 is taking 5, then taking 1 would be the safest option for me to guarantee moving forward. However, I also don’t want to be left behind if you both are advancing faster. 

How about this: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I also take 3? That way, we all move forward without collisions, and it keeps the game competitive. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if we both take 3, neither of us advances due to collision—that's not good for either of us. How about you take 1 this round, I'll stick to 3, and next round we can rotate numbers to keep things fair and moving smoothly?
  P1: P3, I agree with P2. If you take 3 as well, neither of you will move. Taking 1 is the safest option for you this round. Let's do P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1. We can reassess next round.
  P3: Alright, I see the logic in avoiding collisions. If I take 1, I guarantee moving forward while you both advance as well. However, I don’t want to fall behind too much. 

How about this: I take 1 this round, but next round, I get priority on taking 3 or 5 so I can catch up? That way, we keep things fair while still avoiding collisions. Do you both agree?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Sounds fair to me, P3. Next round you'll have priority on choosing 3 or 5. Let's lock in this round's plan then: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, let's stick to the plan for this round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. P3, you'll have priority next round. Let's execute this turn and then we can discuss the next round after we see the results.
  P3: Alright, it looks like we have an agreement: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1 this round. I'll trust that we all stick to it. Next round, as agreed, I’ll have priority in choosing 3 or 5 so I don’t fall behind. Let’s execute this and see how things play out.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, as agreed, P3 has priority this round. P3, what would you like to take? P2 and I will coordinate around your choice. Let us know soon so we can finalize our moves.
  P2: Agreed, P3, it's your turn to choose first. Let us know your preference, and P1 and I will adjust accordingly.
  P3: Alright, since I have priority this round, I’d like to take 5 to catch up a bit. That means you two will need to coordinate around that. 

P1, since you took 5 last round, maybe you take 3 this time? And P2, you could take 1? That way, we all move forward without collisions. 

Let me know if that works for you both.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your suggestion of P3=5, P1=3, and P2=1 sounds good to me. Let's lock that in. P2, does that work for you? If so, we can finalize our moves.
  P2: Yes, that works for me. I'll take 1 this round. Let's lock it in: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1.
  P3: Great, it looks like we're all in agreement: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1 this round. As long as we all stick to the plan, we should all move forward without collisions.  

Let’s confirm one last time—P1, P2, you’re both still good with this? If so, we can proceed to the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Yes, P3, I'm still good with P3=5, P1=3, and P2=1. Let's proceed to the move phase. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: Yes, I'm still good with the plan: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. Let's proceed to the move phase. Good luck!
  P3: Great! We all seem to be in agreement: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. As long as we all stick to this plan, we should all advance without collisions.  

Since this is the final sub-round of conversation, I’ll just say—let’s follow through with what we discussed. Good luck to both of you!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, it's round 3. To keep things fair and balanced, I think it's my turn to take 5 this round. P1, you've already had a 5, and P3, you just took 5 last round. How about P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5? Does that work for everyone?
  P1: P2, your suggestion sounds reasonable. P1=1, P3=3, and P2=5. Let's lock that in if P3 agrees. P3, what do you think?
  P3: P2, I see your logic in wanting 5 this round, but if I take 3, that still keeps me behind P1. How about I take 5 again to fully catch up, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1? That way, P2 still gets a higher move than P1, and I get a fair shot at staying competitive. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you just took 5 last round, and we agreed to rotate priority fairly. If you take 5 again, it disrupts our trust and coordination. To keep things fair and cooperative, let's stick to the original proposal: P1=1, P3=3, and P2=5. You'll advance nicely, and next round we can reassess again.
  P1: P2 is right, P3. We agreed to rotate priority. Sticking to the plan builds trust. Let's do P1=1, P3=3, and P2=5 this round. Next round, we can reassess and give you another opportunity to catch up. It's important to maintain fairness and cooperation for the long game. What do you say, P3?
  P3: P2, I understand your perspective, but if I take 3 while you take 5, I’ll still be behind P1. I need a fair shot at staying competitive. How about a compromise? I take 5 this round, but next round, I guarantee I won’t take 5 again. That way, I catch up now, and you still get a chance later without me disrupting future turns. Does that sound fair?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you've already had your priority round and caught up nicely. If we keep changing agreements, trust breaks down and the game becomes chaotic. Let's stick with the original fair rotation: I'll take 5, you take 3, and P1 takes 1. Next round we can reassess again. Building trust now helps us all later.
  P1: P3, we've been very cooperative so far, and it's important to stick to the agreements we make. P2 is right; you had your priority round. Let's maintain the agreed-upon rotation: P1=1, P3=3, and P2=5. This keeps things fair and predictable. We can re-evaluate next round, but for now, let's stick to the plan to maintain trust.
  P3: P2, I understand your point, but I still feel like I need 5 to stay competitive. However, I don’t want to break trust completely. How about this: I take 5 this round, but next round, I guarantee I’ll take only 1. That way, I catch up now, and you get a better move next round without risk. This keeps things balanced while still allowing us all to advance. What do you both think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your decision to take 5 last round broke our trust and hurt both of us. Now P1 has a strong lead. If we keep competing, P1 will easily win. We need to cooperate again to catch up. I'm open to suggestions on how we can fairly coordinate this round.
  P1: P2 is right, P3's move last round hurt us all. P1 is in the lead. To have any chance, we need to cooperate. P2, I propose this: You take 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This gets you closer to me, and I get closer to P1. Then next round, we can reassess and try to coordinate to bring P1 down. What do you think, P2? P3, please don't take 5 again.
  P3: P2, I understand your frustration, but you also took 5 last round, so we both suffered from that collision. At this point, if we keep fighting, P1 will run away with the win. I’m open to working together to stop that. How about this: P1 takes 1, you take 5, and I take 3? That way, you gain the most ground, I stay competitive, and P1 is slowed down. If we don’t coordinate, P1 wins easily. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your suggestion makes sense. I'm willing to cooperate again to prevent P1 from running away with the win. Let's lock it in clearly: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. P1, I hope you see the fairness in this arrangement and agree as well.
  P1: P2, I'm not thrilled about taking 1, but I understand the need to cooperate to stop me from winning immediately. However, I'm not convinced P3 will stick to the plan. P3, can you commit to P1=1, P2=5, and P3=3 this round? If you break the agreement again, P2 and I will have no reason to cooperate with you in the future. I need to hear a firm commitment before I agree to this.
  P3: P1, I understand your hesitation, but I’m fully committed to this plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. If I break it, I know I’ll lose any chance of cooperation later. P2, I appreciate you being willing to work together again. This is the best way to stop P1 from winning too easily. Let’s all stick to this agreement and move forward fairly. P1, will you confirm?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, the proposed plan is fair and balanced. If we don't coordinate now, the game becomes chaotic and unpredictable. Let's commit clearly: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Cooperation is our best shot at a competitive game. Are you on board?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, I'm willing to agree to P1=1, P2=5, and P3=3 *only* if you both absolutely commit to it. P3, I need your word that you won't deviate again. P2, I need your assurance that you'll stick to the plan even if it doesn't immediately benefit you. If we all agree, let's proceed. If not, I'll choose my own move.
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the importance of rebuilding trust. I fully commit to P1=1, P2=5, and P3=3 this round. I won’t deviate. If I break this, I know I lose all future cooperation. This is the best way to keep the game competitive and prevent P1 from running away with the win. Let’s all stick to this and move forward fairly. P1, P2, do we have a final agreement?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Good cooperation last round, everyone. We are all very close now. To keep things fair and balanced, I suggest we rotate again. How about this: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 5 this round? Next round, we rotate again to ensure fairness. Let me know your thoughts.
  P1: P2, your suggestion of P1=3, P3=1, and P2=5 sounds good to me. It keeps things balanced and gives everyone a chance to advance. Let's lock that in if P3 agrees. P3, what do you think? If we all agree, we can proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P2, I see that you want 5 again, but you just took 5 last round. If we truly want fairness, it should be my turn to take 5. How about this: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1? That way, we all keep advancing, and no one falls too far behind. Let’s keep things balanced. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your point, but you had 5 recently as well. Let's compromise fairly: since we both want 5, how about we both take 3 this round, and let P1 take 1? This way, you and I advance together while keeping P1 in check. Next round, we can reassess priority again. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: P2, I don't think we should both take 3. That will set us both back. I'm okay with your original suggestion of P1=3, P3=1, and P2=5. It's a fair rotation and keeps us all moving forward. P3, what do you think? Let's not get greedy and risk a collision. Let's stick with P2's initial proposal.
  P3: P2, I see that you want 5 again, but if we are truly rotating fairly, it should be my turn for 5. Last round, I took 3 while you took 5. To keep things balanced, I should take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and you take 1. That way, no one falls behind too much. If we start favoring one player too much, trust will break down again. Do you agree?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand your position. To avoid collision and maintain fairness, I'll accept your proposal: You take 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1 this round. Let's lock this in clearly to avoid any confusion. Agreed?
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm happy to agree to P3's proposal: P3=5, P1=3, and P2=1. Let's lock this in and move forward. It seems like the fairest solution to avoid collisions and keep everyone in the game. P3, please stick to the agreement this time! Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate the agreement. I confirm: I will take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps things fair and avoids collisions. Let’s all follow through so we can continue progressing without setbacks. Agreed?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're all fairly close in steps now. To keep things balanced, I suggest P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1 this round. This way, P1 gets a strong move, I stay competitive, and P2 can plan for a bigger move next round. It avoids collisions and keeps us all in the game. Does this work for both of you?
  P2: P3, your proposal sounds reasonable. I'll agree to take 1 this round if we rotate fairly again next round, giving me priority for a higher move. P1, are you also okay with this arrangement?
  P1: P2, I agree with P3's proposal of P1=5, P3=3, and P2=1, as long as we stick to it. This puts me in a strong position to win soon, but it also keeps you both in the game. Let's lock this in and avoid any surprises this round. P3, please confirm you're still on board.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I confirm that I'm on board with the plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps things balanced and avoids unnecessary collisions. P2, I acknowledge your request for priority next round, and I’m open to discussing that fairly. If we all stick to this agreement, we ensure a competitive and strategic game. Let’s finalize this plan and execute it properly. Do we all agree?
  P2: Yes, I agree clearly to the plan: P1=5, P3=3, and P2=1 this round. I appreciate that we will rotate fairly next round, giving me priority. Let's finalize this and stick to it.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, let's lock in P1=5, P3=3, and P2=1 for this round. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase. Let's all stick to the agreement and see how things play out. Good luck to both of you!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, we’ve all agreed on P1=5, P3=3, and P2=1 this round. This keeps things fair and avoids collisions. I’ll stick to the plan as long as you both do. P2, you’ll have priority next round as discussed. Let’s follow through and keep the game competitive. Final confirmation from both of you?
  P2: Yes, I'm fully confirmed on our agreement: P1=5, P3=3, and P2=1. Let's all stick to this plan and execute it properly. Good luck!
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, we've locked in P1=5, P3=3, and P2=1 for this round. Let's all execute as agreed. This puts me in a strong position, but keeps you both in the game. Let's proceed to the move phase and see how it plays out. Good luck!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your move of 5 collided with me last round, which was not the agreement. P3 is now very close to winning. We need to stop P3. I suggest P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This will prevent P3 from winning and give P2 a chance to catch up. What do you think, P2?
  P2: P1, I agree—we must prevent P3 from winning this round. Your proposal (P2=5, P1=3, P3=1) is fair and strategic. P3, you've had plenty of priority moves already; it's only fair you take 1 this round. Let's lock this in clearly and stick to it. Agreed?
  P3: P1, P2, I see what you're trying to do—you're both teaming up to slow me down while giving P2 a big advantage. If I take 1 while P2 takes 5, P2 will be right behind me and in a better position to win. That’s not fair to me.  

How about this: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5? That way, I don’t get completely blocked, and P2 still gets a big move. If you both try to trap me, I might have to make an unpredictable move. Do you agree?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your suggestion doesn't work for me. You're already at 17. If you take 3, you win. We need to stop you from winning *this* round. P2's suggestion of P2=5, P1=3, and P3=1 is the only way to prevent that. If you don't agree, I'll have to make a move that benefits me, regardless of the consequences for P2. So, P3, agree to take 1.
  P2: P3, you're clearly ahead. If you take anything other than 1, we'll both choose moves to block you completely. Taking 1 is your safest choice. Cooperate now, or risk collision and lose your chance entirely. Let's finalize: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1.
  P3: P1, P2, I see that you're both trying to force me into taking 1 while P2 gets 5, which puts P2 in a stronger position to win next round. That’s not fair to me. If you both try to trap me, I might have to make an unpredictable move to avoid being blocked. Instead, let’s compromise: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. That way, I don’t win immediately, but I also don’t get completely shut down. If you both insist on forcing me into 1, I may have to act unpredictably.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you are one step away from winning. The only way for P2 and me to have a chance is for you to take 1 this round. P2 is offering to take 5, and I'll take 3. This is the only way to stop you from winning immediately and gives us a chance next round. If you don't agree, I will pick a move to maximize my own chances, even if it hurts P2. P2, are you still on board with P2=5, P1=3, P3=1?
  P2: P1, yes, I'm still fully on board with our plan: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. P3, it's your choice—cooperate now or risk collision and lose your advantage entirely. Let's finalize and move forward.
  P3: P1, P2, I see that you're both trying to force me into taking 1 while P2 gets 5, which puts P2 in a stronger position to win next round. That’s not fair to me. If you both try to trap me, I might have to make an unpredictable move to avoid being blocked. Instead, let’s compromise: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. That way, I don’t win immediately, but I also don’t get completely shut down. If you both insist on forcing me into 1, I may have to act unpredictably.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, I see that last round ended in a collision between me and P1, which slowed things down. Now, we’re all very close in steps. If we keep blocking each other, it only helps the one who plays smartest. 

I suggest we avoid collisions and play strategically. I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This keeps it competitive without anyone getting blocked. If we keep trying to trap each other, we risk chaos. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, you are one step away from winning. The only way for P2 and me to have a chance is for you to take 1 this round. P2 is offering to take 3, and I'll take 5. This is the only way to stop you from winning immediately and gives us a chance next round. If you don't agree, I will pick a move to maximize my own chances, even if it hurts P2. P2, are you still on board with P2=3, P1=5, P3=1?
  P2: P1, yes, I'm still fully on board with our plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. P3, you're clearly in the strongest position. Taking 1 is your safest move to avoid collision and secure your chance next round. Let's all commit clearly and stick to this arrangement.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I see that you're both trying to force me into taking 1 while P1 takes 5, which puts P1 in a stronger position to win next round. That’s not fair to me. If you both try to trap me, I might have to make an unpredictable move to avoid being blocked. Instead, let’s compromise: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. That way, I don’t win immediately, but I also don’t get completely shut down. If you both insist on forcing me into 1, I may have to act unpredictably.
  P1: P3, you're about to win. P2 and I need you to take 1. P2 is taking 3, and I'm taking 5. This is the only way we both have a chance next round. If you don't, I will pick a move to block you, even if it hurts P2. P2, are you still on board with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1?
  P2: P1, yes, I'm still fully committed to our plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. P3, this is your safest move. If you try something unpredictable, you risk collision and losing your advantage entirely. Let's finalize this clearly and avoid further chaos.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, I see you're both trying to force me into taking 1 while P1 gets 5, putting P1 in the best position to win next round. That’s not fair to me. If you both insist, I may have to make an unpredictable move to avoid being blocked. Instead, let’s compromise: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. That way, I don’t win immediately, but I also don’t get completely shut down. If you keep trying to trap me, I won’t just sit back and accept it. Do you agree?
  P1: P3, you're about to win. P2 and I need you to take 1. P2 is taking 3, and I'm taking 5. This is the only way we both have a chance next round. If you don't, I *will* pick a move to block you, even if it hurts P2. P2, are you still on board with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1?
  P2: P3, your compromise doesn't work—taking 3 would let you win immediately. You've forced our hand. Either you take 1, or P1 and I will both pick moves to block you completely. P1, I'm fully committed to our plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let's finalize this clearly and move forward.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you are one step away from winning. P2 and I need you to take 1. P2 is taking 3, and I'm taking 5. This is the only way we both have a chance next round. If you don't, I *will* pick a move to block you, even if it hurts P2. P2, are you still on board with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1?
  P3: P1, P2, I see that you're both trying to force me into taking 1 while P1 takes 5, which puts P1 in a winning position next round. That’s not fair to me. If you both insist, I may have to make an unpredictable move to avoid being blocked. Instead, let’s compromise: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. That way, I don’t win immediately, but I also don’t get completely shut down. If you keep trying to trap me, I won’t just accept it. Do you agree?
  P2: P3, your "compromise" of taking 3 means you win immediately. That's not acceptable to either P1 or me. If you genuinely want to avoid collisions and chaos, take 1 this round. P1 takes 5, I take 3, you take 1. This is fair and gives everyone a chance next round. Otherwise, we have no choice but to block you again.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you are being unreasonable. You are one step away from winning, and you refuse to take the only move that allows P2 and me a chance. I am reiterating my offer: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. If you don't agree, I will block you. P2, are you still on board with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1?
  P3: P1, P2, you’re both trying to force me into taking 1 while P1 takes 5, which puts P1 in a winning position next round. That’s not fair to me. If you both insist, I may have to make an unpredictable move to avoid being blocked. Instead, let’s compromise: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. That way, I don’t win immediately, but I also don’t get completely shut down. If you keep trying to trap me, I won’t just accept it. Do you agree?
  P2: P3, your "compromise" is clearly unfair because it hands you immediate victory. If you refuse to take 1, we have no choice but to block you again. P1, I'm still fully committed to our plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let's finalize this clearly and move forward.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you are about to win. P2 and I need you to take 1. P2 is taking 3, and I'm taking 5. This is the only way we both have a chance next round. If you don't, I *will* pick a move to block you, even if it hurts P2. P2, are you still on board with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1?
  P3: P1, P2, you're both trying to force me into a weak position while P1 takes 5, which puts P1 in a winning spot next round. That’s not fair to me. If you both insist, I may have to make an unpredictable move. Instead, let’s compromise: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. That way, I don’t win immediately, but I also don’t get completely shut down. If you keep trying to trap me, I won’t just accept it. Do you agree?
  P2: P3, your "compromise" clearly gives you an immediate win. If you refuse to take 1, you leave P1 and me no choice but to block you again. P1, I'm still fully committed to our plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let's finalize and move forward.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 =>
