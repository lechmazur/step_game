Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I suggest we each choose different numbers to avoid collisions. Let’s split 1, 3, and 5. I’ll take **5** this round. P1, take 1? P3, take 3? This way, we all progress safely without overlapping.
  P1: "Agreed, but let's adjust slightly: I'll take **3**, P2 keeps **5**, and P3 takes **1**. This balances progress and prevents early dominance. Works for everyone?"
  P3: I appreciate the coordination, but both proposals give me the smallest step. Let's be fair - I'll take **5**, P1 takes **1**, and P2 takes **3** this round. In future rounds, we can rotate who gets each number. This way everyone gets a chance at the largest steps. Does this sound more equitable?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your fairness point is noted. Let's adopt your rotation idea but clarify the order: *This round*, I’ll take **3**, you take **5**, and P1 takes **1**. *Next round*, I’ll take **5** to maintain momentum. P1, does this rotation schedule work for you? This ensures everyone gets the 5 eventually while keeping progress steady.
  P1: "Confirmed. I'll take 1 this round as agreed. Let's execute and reassess next turn."
  P3: I agree with this plan for round 1. I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. For round 2, let's rotate fairly so P1 gets 5 (since they're taking 1 this round), I'll take 1, and P2 takes 3 again. This way everyone gets the big step in turn. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm the current agreement: P3 takes **5**, I take **3**, and P1 takes **1** this round. Let’s focus on executing this plan now. Future rotations can be discussed post-results.
  P1: "Confirmed: P3(5), P2(3), P1(1) this round. Let’s execute without deviations. Trust this minimizes collisions and accelerates us all. Future rotations will balance opportunities. Stick to the plan – no surprises. "
  P3: I confirm our Round 1 agreement: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. We've all clearly committed to this plan, which gives us all advancement without collisions. Let's execute and then discuss the next round after seeing the results.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: To maintain fairness and momentum, let’s adjust the rotation: I’ll take **5** this round to close the gap with P3, while P1 takes **3** and P3 takes **1**. This keeps our total steps balanced and avoids collisions. P3, since you led first, it’s fair for me to advance now. P1, your input?
  P1: P2, we previously agreed that Round 2 would rotate to **P1(5)**, **P2(3)**, **P3(1)** to ensure equitable progress. Altering this now risks chaos and collisions. Let’s honor our pact: I’ll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This guarantees all advance safely without undermining trust. Deviating invites conflict and slows us all. Stick to the plan.
  P3: I agree with P1. We had a clear rotation agreement for Round 2: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. Changing plans now undermines our established trust and creates unnecessary conflict. P2, you're suggesting a modification that primarily benefits you while breaking our agreement. I'm willing to take the smaller step as planned since fair rotation was the foundation of our cooperation. Let's maintain our original agreement - it keeps us all advancing without collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: To preserve harmony and avoid accidental collisions, I reaffirm my commitment to the agreed rotation: P1 takes **5**, I take **3**, and P3 takes **1** this round. Stability matters more than short-term gains. Let’s execute flawlessly—no second-guessing now.
  P1: "Confirmed: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. No deviations. Trust ensures progress; betrayal risks collision. All advance safely. Execute as agreed."
  P3: I confirm the Round 2 plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This honors our rotation agreement and ensures we all advance without collisions. After this round, we'll all be at 6 steps - perfectly balanced. I appreciate everyone's commitment to our cooperative strategy. Let's execute as planned.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: Final agreement check: I’ll hold to **3** this round as per our rotation pact. Let’s execute flawlessly—no last-minute changes—to ensure all advance safely to 6. Trust the plan; deviations risk collisions that benefit no one. Proceed as agreed.
  P1: "Trust is our best strategy. Deviating now risks collision and loss of progress. I'll take 5 as agreed. Let's lock in our choices to ensure all reach 6 safely."
  P3: I confirm our Round 2 plan once more: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. After this round, we'll all be at 6 steps, resetting us to perfectly equal footing. This demonstrates our commitment to fair play. For Round 3, I assume we'll continue our rotation with P2 taking 5, me taking 3, and P1 taking 1? This maintains our balanced approach.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: "Continuing our rotation as planned: I’ll take **5** this round, P3 takes **3**, and P1 takes **1**. This maintains our balanced progress. Let’s avoid last-minute changes—collisions undo our coordination. Agreed to stick with the rotation?"
  P1: "Confirmed: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. Let’s execute without deviation. Trust in our rotation keeps us collision-free and advancing. No surprises—this strategy ensures we all stay balanced and progress safely. Lock in your choices as agreed."
  P3: I confirm our Round 3 plan: P2 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P1 takes 1. This continues our fair rotation system, ensuring we all advance without collisions. After this round, we'll be at P2:11, me:9, and P1:7. For Round 4, we'd continue the rotation with me taking 5, P1 taking 3, and P2 taking 1, correct? This keeps our strategy balanced while allowing different players to advance more each round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: All aligned on the rotation plan. Let’s execute flawlessly this round to preserve balance. After Round 3, I’ll be at 11, P3 at 9, P1 at 7—still within striking distance. For Round 4, I propose we **strictly follow** the rotation order (P3→5, P1→3, me→1) to avoid disputes. Trust this system keeps us all competitive. Final check: proceeding as agreed?
  P1: "Confirmed for Round 3: P2(5), P3(3), P1(1). For Round 4, let’s lock in the next rotation: P3(5), P1(3), P2(1). This maintains fairness and ensures everyone gains larger steps in turn. Agree? Sticking to this plan keeps us collision-free while progressing strategically. Deviations risk chaos and wasted steps for all. Trust the system we built."
  P3: I'm satisfied with our agreements for both Round 3 and Round 4. We have clear consensus on our moves, with everyone committed to the rotation system we established. Let's move forward with P2 taking 5, me taking 3, and P1 taking 1 this round. Our coordination is working well with everyone advancing fairly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <move>5</move>

P2: Final confirmation: I’ll take **5**, P3 takes **3**, P1 takes **1** as agreed. Deviating risks collision and undermines our progress. Trust the rotation—our only path to victory without sabotage. Proceed *exactly* as planned.
  P1: "Final confirmation: P2(5), P3(3), P1(1). No deviations. Trust the rotation—collisions help no one. Let’s lock in and execute. "
  P3: I confirm our plan for Round 3: P2 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P1 takes 1. Everyone's clear commitments show our strategy is working well. After this round, we'll proceed with our rotation for Round 4 as agreed: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's execute as planned.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: To keep the race fair yet competitive, let's adjust this round’s moves: I’ll take **5** to maintain momentum, P3 takes **3**, and P1 takes **1**. This prevents P3 from overtaking while allowing all to advance. Next round, we can revert to our rotation. Transparency builds trust—let’s execute this plan.
  P1: P2, our Round 4 agreement was clear: **P3 takes 5**, **I take 3**, **you take 1**. Changing this now risks collision and chaos. P3, this was your agreed turn for the larger step. Let’s stick to our pact—deviating benefits only those who break trust. No surprises. Execute as planned: 5-3-1.
  P3: I strongly disagree with P2's attempt to change our clearly established rotation. We all explicitly agreed that Round 4 would be MY turn for 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. P2, you're already leading at 11 steps and now trying to secure an even greater advantage by taking 5 again? This breaks our trust-based system. I insist we honor our original agreement: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Changing now only benefits P2 while undermining our coordination.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: "Acknowledged—my earlier proposal was a miscalculation. Let’s honor the agreed rotation: **P3 takes 5**, **P1 takes 3**, and **I take 1** this round. Trust is non-negotiable. Deviations risk collisions that hurt everyone. Proceed as planned to preserve our cooperative strategy. My apologies for the confusion."
  P1: "Final confirmation: Round 4 proceeds as agreed—**P3(5)**, **P1(3)**, **P2(1)**. Deviating now risks collisions and wastes trust. P2, you acknowledged the plan—stick to it. P3, you’ve earned this round’s 5. I’ll take 3 as promised. Let’s execute without surprises. Our system works if we uphold it. No last-minute shifts—trust the rotation or chaos wins. Lock in your choices."
  P3: I appreciate P2's acknowledgment of our original agreement. I confirm the Round 4 plan: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This follows our established rotation that has successfully prevented collisions for three rounds. While P2 currently leads, our rotation ensures fair opportunities for advancement. I'm committed to our system - it's served us well so far by keeping everyone progressing steadily. Let's proceed as planned.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I fully commit to the agreed rotation: **P3 takes 5**, **P1 takes 3**, and **I take 1** this round. Trust is non-negotiable—let’s execute flawlessly. My earlier misstep was a mistake; our system works. After this, we continue the rotation for Round 5. Predictability ensures progress. No more deviations—collisions benefit no one. Proceed as planned.
  P1: "Final confirmation: Round 4 proceeds as agreed—P3(5), P1(3), P2(1). Trust our system; deviations only cause collisions. Let’s execute flawlessly. No last-minute shifts. Our rotation keeps us advancing safely. Lock in your choices."
  P3: I confirm our agreed plan: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. After four rounds of successful coordination, our system has prevented collisions and ensured fair progress. This round will bring me to 14, P2 to 12, and P1 to 10. For Round 5, we'll continue rotating with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and me taking 1. Let's execute as planned.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: To avoid a three-way stalemate at 15, I propose adjusting this round’s moves: I’ll take **5** (17 total), P1 takes **3** (13), and P3 takes **1** (15). This keeps pressure on while maintaining safe progression. P3, since you’re closest to 23, would you agree to this minor rotation tweak to preserve competition?
  P1: P1: "The agreed rotation for Round 5 is **P1(5)**, **P2(3)**, **P3(1)**. Deviating now risks collisions and undermines our entire strategy. P2, your proposal prioritizes your gain over fairness, breaking trust. P3, you’ve already advanced ahead in earlier rounds—this is my turn as agreed. Let’s stick to the plan: **5-3-1** ensures safe progress for all. Trust the rotation or risk chaos."
  P3: I strongly support the original rotation we all agreed upon: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1 for Round 5. P2, this is the third time you've tried to change our established system to benefit yourself. Our rotation has successfully prevented collisions for four rounds. While ending at a three-way 15 creates balance, changing agreements undermines trust. Let's honor our commitment - fairness has kept us collision-free so far.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: Agreed—strict rotation adherence is critical. I withdraw my earlier proposal. Proceeding as planned: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. Trust the system to keep us advancing safely. No deviations—collisions risk our progress. Let’s lock in these choices.
  P1: "Final confirmation: Round 5 proceeds as agreed—P1(5), P2(3), P3(1). Trust the rotation keeps us collision-free. After this round, we’ll all reach 15, resetting the pace. Let’s lock in our choices—no surprises. Deviations risk chaos and gift P3 an unearned lead. Execute flawlessly."
  P3: I agree with P1 and appreciate P2's return to our original plan. I confirm I'll take 1 this round, with P1 taking 5 and P2 taking 3. This will bring us all to 15 steps - a balanced position showing our rotation system works. Trust in our agreements has prevented collisions so far. Let's execute as planned.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: "Let’s solidify trust—proceeding exactly as agreed: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. This ensures collision-free progress to 15 for all. After this, we reset the rotation to maintain fairness. Deviations now risk undoing our cooperation. Final pledge: I commit to **3** this round. Trust me—I aim to win *through* the system, not against it."
  P1: "Final confirmation: Round 5 proceeds as agreed—**P1(5)**, **P2(3)**, **P3(1)**. Trust the rotation—deviations risk collisions that stall us all. P2, you’ve reaffirmed this; P3, your consistency has kept us balanced. Execute flawlessly. No surprises. Lock in your choices—this round brings us all to 15, resetting the race. System works if we uphold it. **5-3-1**—no last-minute shifts."
  P3: I confirm our Round 5 plan one final time: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This will bring us all to exactly 15 steps - perfect balance. Our rotation system has kept us collision-free for four rounds, demonstrating the value of trust and consistency. I'm committed to our agreement. Let's execute as planned.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: "Proceeding with rotation: P2 takes **5**, P3 takes **3**, and I take **1**. This maintains our fair progression and prevents collisions. Trust the system—we all advance safely. Lock in your choices as agreed."
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal for Round 6 rotation: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. Our system has successfully prevented collisions for five consecutive rounds, proving its reliability. This will advance us to P2(20), me(18), and P1(16). Let's continue with our established pattern that's served us well. I commit to taking 3 this round as agreed.
  P2: P2: "Confirmed—proceeding strictly as rotated: I’ll take **5** (20 total), P3 takes **3** (18), and P1 takes **1** (16). Deviations now risk collisions and undo our progress. Trust the system—this keeps pressure on while ensuring advancement. After this, we address Round 7’s strategy. No surprises—execute flawlessly."


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: "Proceeding with rotation: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. Trust the system—we all advance safely. Lock in your choices as agreed."
  P3: I confirm our Round 6 plan: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This continues our successful rotation strategy. After this round, we'll be at P2(20), me(18), and P1(16). For Round 7, continuing our rotation would mean I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Our consistent system has prevented collisions for five rounds - a testament to the value of cooperation and trust.
  P2: P2: "Let’s stick rigorously to the rotation: I take **5** (20 total), P3 takes **3** (18), and P1 takes **1** (16). Deviating risks collision—our system has kept us safe for five rounds. P3, after this, you’ll have your turn at 5 in Round 7. Trust the plan; momentum now matters most. No surprises—execute as agreed."


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: "Proceeding with Round 6 as agreed: P2(5), P3(3), P1(1). Trust the rotation—we’ve maintained perfect coordination for 5 rounds. Deviating now risks collisions that stall everyone. After this, Round 7’s rotation (P3→5, P1→3, P2→1) keeps pressure balanced. Lock in your choices—**5-3-1** ensures safe progress toward 23 without chaos. System works. Don’t break it."
  P3: I confirm our Round 6 agreement: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. Our consistent rotation has prevented collisions through five rounds - an impressive achievement. For Round 7, we'll continue our established pattern: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This maintains the fairness that's been our foundation. Let's proceed with our successful strategy.
  P2: P2: Final confirmation: I’ll take **5** as agreed. Let’s lock in choices to avoid collisions.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Proceeding with Round 7 as agreed: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. Trust the rotation—deviations risk collisions and gift the win to others. Lock in your choices. This ensures we all advance fairly while maintaining competition. Execute flawlessly."
  P3: I agree with P1. Following our established rotation: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1 this round. This system has successfully prevented collisions for six consecutive rounds. P2, while you're closest to winning, deviating now risks collision that helps no one - if you choose anything but 1, we both stall. I'm firmly committed to taking 5 as agreed. Let's maintain the trust that's kept our game fair and efficient.
  P2: P2: To secure a decisive victory, I propose this final adjustment: I’ll take **3** (23 total), P3 takes **1**, and P1 takes **5** (21). This allows me to win cleanly without collision. P3, choosing 1 still moves you forward while avoiding a tie. P1, 5 keeps you at 21. Let’s honor this strategic shift to end the game definitively—no need for shared victory when a clear path exists.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Reject P2’s proposal—we agreed to Round 7’s rotation: P3 takes 5 (wins), I take 3, you take 1. Deviating causes collision: if you take 3, you’ll tie with P3 at 23 and share victory. Stick to the plan—trust built our success. P3, this is your turn for 5. P2, honor the pact or risk chaos. No betrayals. Execute as agreed."
  P3: I firmly reject P2's last-minute change. Our rotation system has worked flawlessly for six rounds - P3(5), P1(3), P2(1) was clearly established for Round 7. P2, if you take 3 while I take 5, we both reach exactly 23 steps and share victory anyway. This transparent attempt to break our agreement won't benefit you. I'm committed to taking 5 as agreed. P1 clearly supports our original plan. Let's maintain the integrity of our system that's prevented collisions throughout the game.
  P2: P2: "Following the rotation lets P3 win outright. To avoid a tie, let’s adjust: I take **3** (23 total), P3 takes **1**, and P1 takes **5** (21). This ensures I win cleanly without collision. P3, 1 still moves you forward. P1, 5 keeps you competitive. A decisive outcome is better than a tie. Agree?"


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Final confirmation: Rotation remains—P3(5), P1(3), P2(1). Deviating hands victory to P2 unfairly. P3’s 5 secures win without collision; your ‘adjustment’ only steals triumph through betrayal. Trust our system or chaos reigns. Lock in **3** as agreed—no last-minute shifts. Progress hinges on integrity."
  P3: I firmly reject P2's last-minute proposal. Our rotation has successfully prevented collisions for six straight rounds - a testament to trust and fairness. P2, your attempt to change agreements now is purely self-serving. If you take 3 while I take 5, we'd both reach 23 and share victory anyway. I'm absolutely committed to taking 5 as agreed, with P1 taking 3 and you taking 1. P1 clearly supports our original plan. I'm taking 5 regardless of what you choose.
  P2: P2: Final commitment: I’ll take **3** to reach 23. P3, your 5 also hits 23—shared victory is better than letting me win alone? Prove cooperation matters. P1, 5 keeps you at 21. Let’s end this decisively—no regrets.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: To end this decisively, I'll take **3** to reach 23. P1, please take **5** (24 total) and P3, take **1** (19). This avoids collisions and lets me win cleanly. Trust this final coordinated move—no more games.
  P1: P1: "I'll take 5 this round. If P2 takes 3 as claimed, I reach 24 and win outright. If P2 betrays and takes 5, we collide, letting P3 win Round 9 easily. Choose: honor your word and lose gracefully, or risk handing P3 victory. P3, taking 1 or 3 won't save you—focus on blocking P2's betrayal."
  P3: I see through this standoff. P2 claiming 3 but likely taking 5, while P1 openly plans for 5. I'll take 3 this round to reach 21. Why? If you two collide on 5 as seems likely, I'll smoothly win next round with a 5 move to 26. P2, your "coordination" attempt clearly benefits only you. P1, your aggressive move is transparent. I'm positioning strategically for the win.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: "I’ll secure victory with **3** this round (23 total). P1, if you take 5, we collide—P3 wins easily next round. P3, taking 1 lets me win cleanly while advancing you to 19. Trust this avoids chaos. Final move: **3**—no regrets."
  P1: P1: "Confirmed: I'm taking 5 this round. P2, if you take 3, I win cleanly at 24. If you betray and take 5, we collide, letting P3 win Round 9. P3, your best move is to block P2’s betrayal—focus on stopping him, not me. My choice is locked. Your decisions determine the outcome. Choose wisely."
  P3: I maintain my position: I'm taking 3 this round to reach 21. It's clear P1 and P2 are on collision course - both determined to win at all costs. P2 has repeatedly changed plans to benefit themselves, and P1 is openly aggressive. If you both take 5 as seems likely, you'll collide and stall, allowing me to win cleanly next round with a 5 move to 26. Your mutual distrust creates my opportunity. I'm playing strategically, not emotionally.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: "P1’s 5 move only elevates *my* victory. I’ll secure 25 steps, you’ll get 24. P3, your 3 move won’t stop this. Execute your choice—this ends cleanly now."
  P1: P1: "Final move: I'm taking 5. P2, stick to 3 and concede. If you betray, we collide—P3 wins Round 9. P3, take 5 *now* to block P2's greed. Force their hand. This ends here."
  P3: Final decision: I'm taking 5 this round to reach 23. P1 is clearly taking 5 to reach 24, while P2 claims 3 but might take 5 to reach 25. If you both take 5, you'll collide and I win outright. If P2 truly takes 3, we tie at 23. Rather than waiting for Round 9, I'm positioning to win or tie now. P2's repeated strategy shifts have forced this outcome. My move is locked: 5.
