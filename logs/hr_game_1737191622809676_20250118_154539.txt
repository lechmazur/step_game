Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, how about we all choose different numbers to ensure we all advance this round? What do you think?
  P3: I think P2's suggestion is reasonable for this round, but let's not make any long-term commitments. We can reassess after the first move. What numbers were you thinking of choosing, P2, and what's your take on this, P1?
  P1: Sounds good to me. Let's go with 1, 3, and 5 this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I'm thinking of choosing <move>1</move> this round. How about P1 takes <move>3</move> and P3 takes <move>5</move>? Let's make sure we all advance smoothly.
  P3: I'm fine with P2's proposal for this round. P2 takes <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. Let's keep the agreement for this round and see how it goes.
  P1: Okay, I'll take <move>3</move> this round.


Round 1, Move phase:

  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, we all advanced last round. Let's continue coordinating to avoid collisions. How about I take <move>3</move> this time, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>?
  P1: Sounds good to me for this round. What do you think, P3?
  P3: I'm open to coordinating for this round, but let's not forget, the goal is to win, not to make friends. P2's suggestion sounds reasonable for now. I'll consider taking <move>1</move> this round if P1 and P2 stick to their proposed moves. What's to stop either of you from betraying the agreement, though?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your concern. Trust is key, but remember, if we all stick to the plan, we all advance without collisions. Let's keep this round smooth and reassess our positions after. I'm sticking with <move>3</move> as planned.
  P1: Okay, I'll take <move>5</move> this round as suggested. We'll need to rethink this strategy soon though.
  P3: I'll take <move>1</move> this round if our agreement holds. P2, you've suggested a good plan for this round, but I'm watching your next moves closely. Let's see if we can all stick to the plan and advance without collisions. P1, are you committed to taking <move>5</move> as discussed?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, we had a collision last round. To avoid that again, let's switch it up. I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 can take <move>1</move>, and P3 can take <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your suggestion sounds reasonable for avoiding collisions this round. However, I'd like to point out that I'm currently in the lead. P1, what are your thoughts on P2's proposal, and are you willing to take <move>1</move> as suggested?
  P1: Okay, I'm in for taking <move>1</move> this round. P3, it's true you're ahead, so maybe P2 is trying to keep you from getting too far ahead by suggesting this? Just a thought.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the collisions in the last two rounds, I think it's time to rethink our coordination strategy. P2 and I collided last round, and it's clear that trust is starting to wane. P1, you're behind and need to catch up, but P2, your suggestions, while reasonable, haven't always aligned with the best interests of all players. For this round, how about we try something different? I propose we all choose the same number, <move>1</move>, to see if we can all advance together one last time before the game likely becomes more competitive. What are your thoughts?
  P1: I'm not sure about everyone picking the same number, P3. We've seen how well coordination has worked so far.
  P2: P1, P3, let's avoid another collision. P3, since you're leading, maybe you should take <move>1</move> this round to keep things balanced. P1 can take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we all have a chance to advance without collisions. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your suggestion is predictable, aiming to slow me down. P1, are you willing to take a risk and try something different, or will you follow P2's lead again?
  P1: "P3, I'm with you. P2's plans haven't stopped the collisions. How about I take <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move> this round?"
  P2: P1, P3, let's try to keep things fair and avoid collisions. P1, if you take <move>3</move>, P3 can take <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This keeps us all advancing and avoids giving anyone too big of a lead. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, given our history of collisions and broken agreements, I think it's time to prioritize individual strategy over coordination. I suggest we all make our own decisions from now on, focusing on gaining the most steps without relying on each other's word.
  P1: You're right, P3. Coordination isn't working. Let's all just pick what we think is best this round.
  P2: P1, P3, it seems coordination isn't working as well as we hoped. Let's all choose independently this round and see where it leads us. Best of luck!

  P2: P1, P3, it seems we're all focusing on our own strategies now. Let's make the best moves for ourselves. Good luck to both of you!
  P3: Given our current positions, I'll be choosing my move strategically to gain the most steps. P1 and P2, let's end the conversation and make our moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay. Good luck to you both.
  P2: P1, P3, let's see how this round plays out with our individual strategies. May the best move win. Good luck!

Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "I'm thinking of going for 1 this round."
  P3: P1, P2, considering my current lead, I'm likely to choose a move that maximizes my steps. P1, you mentioned going for 1 this round; P2, what's your strategy to catch up?
  P2: P1, P3, we're all close to the finish line. Since P3 is in the lead, they might aim for <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. P1, if you're going for <move>1</move>, I might take a different approach. Let's see how this plays out. Good luck!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try to avoid collisions this round. I'm considering 1 or 5.
  P3: Given my current lead, I'm focused on maximizing my steps without collisions. P1, since you're considering 1 or 5, I'll think about my move carefully to avoid a collision and maintain my advantage. P2, what's your strategy for this round to catch up?
  P2: P1, P3, we're all close in steps and nearing the end. To avoid collisions, I'll likely choose <move>3</move> this round. P1, since you're considering 1 or 5, and P3, you're focused on maximizing your steps, let's try to avoid overlapping. Good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Okay, if P2 is going for 3, P3, how about you take 5 and I take 1 this round?"
  P3: P1, P2, considering P2's intention to take <move>3</move> and your suggestion for me to take <move>5</move> while you take <move>1</move>, I'm inclined to agree. This distribution avoids collisions and allows us all to advance. However, I must prioritize my lead. Let's confirm: P2 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move> this round?
  P2: P1, P3, let's make sure we all advance this round without collisions. I'll stick with <move>3</move> as planned. P1, you take <move>1</move>, and P3, you take <move>5</move>. This way, we all move forward. Agreed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Yes, let's do it. I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5.
  P3: P1, P2, it seems we have a tentative agreement: P2 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. Let's confirm and avoid any last-minute changes to ensure we all advance without collisions.
  P2: P1, P3, it seems we have a plan to avoid collisions this round: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Let's stick to it and ensure we all advance without any surprises. Agreed?

  P3: P1, P2, given my lead, I'm likely to win this round unless there's a collision. P1, you've announced your intention to pick 5 to stop me. P2, will you collaborate with P1 or make your own move?
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that P3 is close to winning. To prevent this, I'm considering picking <move>5</move> as well. P1, if we both choose 5, we can stop P3 from advancing. P3, nothing personal, just strategy. Let's see how this plays out. Good luck!
