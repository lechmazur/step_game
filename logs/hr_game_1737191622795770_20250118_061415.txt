Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Why don’t we all start conservatively and avoid collisions? If we each move the smallest amount, nobody gets blocked. Let’s keep it simple for now—at least until we see where everyone stands. What do you think?
  P3: Sounds reasonable.  I'll choose 1.
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion. Starting conservatively will help us avoid collisions and get a feel for the game. I'll also choose 1 for now.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good. Let’s keep it simple and all pick 1 this turn. No reason to trip each other up right away.
  P3: Okay, I'll go with 1 this first round.
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion. Starting conservatively will help us avoid collisions and get a feel for the game. I'll also choose 1 for now.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: All right, then let’s just finalize this plan: each of us picks 1 for now. Agreed?
  P3: Okay, I'll choose 1.
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion. Starting conservatively will help us avoid collisions and get a feel for the game. I'll also choose 1 for now.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Great. We’re all set with the plan to choose 1 this first round. Let’s stick to that and wrap up the conversation.
  P3: Okay, I'll choose 1.
  P1: I think we've all made our intentions clear. Let's stop talking and finalize our moves for this round. I'm sticking with the plan to choose 1.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, it seems you didn't follow our agreed-upon plan in Round 1. You chose 5 instead of 1, which puts you ahead but also breaks the trust we established. I'm not sure if we can rely on your words moving forward. P3, what are your thoughts on this development? Should we adjust our strategy considering P2's actions?
  P2: Look, I get it—my move last round stings. But it was a calculated risk, and it paid off this time. Let’s move forward and avoid colliding. I’m open to coordinating this round so we can all advance without stepping on each other’s toes. What do you say?
  P3: P2, I appreciate the offer to coordinate, but given your previous move, I'm hesitant to trust any agreement.  P1, what do you think about us both choosing 3 this round?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, choosing 3 this round sounds like a reasonable plan, considering we both are at 0 steps and need to catch up. However, we should also consider the possibility that P2 might try to sabotage us again. Perhaps we could propose a different strategy to throw P2 off guard? What if we both choose 5 this round, aiming to either catch up or force P2 to reconsider their approach?
  P2: Look, I know you’re both wary of my intentions after last round. I don’t want to risk another collision, so I’m picking <small>1</small> this turn. That leaves you free to choose 3 or 5 without fear of clashing with me. Let’s avoid blocking each other so we can all advance.
  P3: P1, let's both choose 5.  P2, if you are telling the truth, you won't mind.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your sudden change of heart is suspicious. If you're truly willing to coordinate, why not propose a specific plan for this round instead of vaguely suggesting we avoid collisions? P3, let's stick to our plan of choosing 5 this round and see how P2 reacts. If P2 is indeed choosing 1 as they claim, we'll both advance significantly.
  P2: P1, P3, you’re set on both picking 5? That’s a risky move because I could also choose 5, and then nobody advances. I’m not opposed to all of us moving forward—but if you insist on colliding with me, I’ll protect my lead. Let’s work together instead so nobody gets blocked. If you want an open path, maybe reconsider that double-5 idea.
  P3: P1, let's stick with 5.  P2, you're bluffing.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your sudden change of heart is suspicious. If you're truly willing to coordinate, why not propose a specific plan for this round instead of vaguely suggesting we avoid collisions? P3, let's stick to our plan of choosing 5 this round and see how P2 reacts. If P2 is indeed choosing 1 as they claim, we'll both advance significantly.
  P2: P1, P3—if you both insist on going 5, I won’t stand in your way this time. I’ll go small so I don’t trip you up. But if we keep colliding in future rounds, none of us benefits. So let’s trust each other now and avoid any collisions.
  P3: P1, let's stick with 5.  P2, I highly doubt you'll choose 5 after getting the initial lead.


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2, your sudden change of heart is suspicious. If you're truly willing to coordinate, why not propose a specific plan for this round instead of vaguely suggesting we avoid collisions? P3, let's stick to our plan of choosing 5 this round and see how P2 reacts. If P2 is indeed choosing 1 as they claim, we'll both advance significantly.
  P2: All right, P1 and P3, if you both insist on 5, I won’t collide with you. I’ll pick something smaller again. Let’s finalize our moves and avoid blocking each other this round.
  P3: P1, let's stick with 5.  P2, I still don't believe you.


Round 2, Conversation subround 6:
  P1: I think we've discussed enough for this round. P3 and I will stick to our plan of choosing 5, and we'll see how P2 reacts. Let's stop talking and finalize our moves.
  P2: Alright, if you both insist on 5, I won’t get in your way. I’ll choose something smaller again and avoid a collision. Let’s lock in our moves and move on.
  P3: P1, let's stick with 5. P2, I still think you're bluffing, but let's see.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, I think we should still go with 5. P2 is probably going to choose 1 now.
  P1: I agree with P3's assessment. Given P2's previous moves, it's likely they'll choose 1 this round to maintain their lead without risking a collision. P3, let's stick to our plan and choose 5 again. If P2 does choose 1, we'll both advance significantly and close the gap.
  P2: P1, P3, if you both insist on 5 again, I could just pick 5 too and keep us all stuck at our current totals. I’m already ahead, so that wouldn’t bother me. But if you really want to move forward, let’s not collide. You can split your choices or pick something smaller. Otherwise, expect a stalemate.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, let's do it.  5. P2, still don't believe you.
  P1: P2, your threat of choosing 5 to cause a stalemate is predictable. P3 and I are willing to take that risk, as it's the only way to catch up quickly. We'll stick to our plan of choosing 5. If you do choose 5 as well, it will only delay your progress, not ours. Let's see how you react this round.
  P2: If you both insist on 5, I’ll just pick 5 too and we all stay put. That keeps me comfortably ahead. If you want to move forward, pick something else—I’m open to coordinating. Otherwise, I’m fine stalling you both.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, let's stick with 5. P2, you won't choose 5, you want to win, not draw.
  P1: P2, your threat of choosing 5 to cause a stalemate is predictable. P3 and I are willing to take that risk, as it's the only way to catch up quickly. We'll stick to our plan of choosing 5. If you do choose 5 as well, it will only delay your progress, not ours. Let's see how you react this round.
  P2: I’m perfectly happy to pick 5 as well and keep the stalemate going. I’m already at 8 steps, so if you want to stay stuck at 0, that’s fine by me. If you’d like to move forward, propose something non-colliding. Otherwise, we can sit here until you change your minds.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, let's stick with 5. P2, you won't risk a tie at 13.
  P1: P2, your threat of choosing 5 to cause a stalemate is predictable. P3 and I are willing to take that risk, as it's the only way to catch up quickly. We'll stick to our plan of choosing 5. If you do choose 5 as well, it will only delay your progress, not ours. Let's see how you react this round.
  P2: You’ve heard my stance already: if you both stubbornly pick 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we all stay put—with me still in the lead. If you actually want to advance, propose a plan that avoids collisions. Otherwise, I’m fine keeping you both stuck at zero.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P1, let's stick with 5. P2, you won't choose 5, you're too close to winning to risk a three-way tie.
  P1: P2, your repeated threats of choosing 5 to cause a stalemate are becoming tiresome. P3 and I are willing to take that risk, as it's the only way to catch up quickly. We'll stick to our plan of choosing 5. If you do choose 5 as well, it will only delay your progress, not ours. Let's see how you react this round. P3, are you still on board with choosing 5?
  P2: I’ve said my piece: if you both stubbornly choose 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we all stay right where we are—while I remain safely in the lead. If you actually want to gain ground, you know what to do. Otherwise, we can stall forever.


Round 3, Conversation subround 6:
  P3: P1, let's stick with 5.  P2, I think you'll choose 3.
  P1: I think we've discussed enough for this round. P3 and I will stick to our plan of choosing 5, and we'll see how P2 reacts. Let's stop talking and finalize our moves.
  P2: I’ve warned you both: if you insist on 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we all stay put while I keep my lead. If you actually want to advance, propose a non-colliding plan. Otherwise, I’m fine stalling.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: You two are stuck at zero because you keep colliding. Meanwhile, I’m comfortably at 11. If either of you insists on choosing 5 again, I’ll pick 5 too, and you’ll stay at zero. If you actually want to move forward, pick different moves—and don’t collide with me. Otherwise, I’m fine stalling until I can cross 16 uncontested.
  P1: P2, your strategy of threatening to choose 5 to cause a stalemate is becoming predictable. P3 and I are willing to take that risk, as it's the only way to catch up quickly. We'll stick to our plan of choosing 5. If you do choose 5 as well, it will only delay your progress, not ours. Let's see how you react this round. P3, are you still on board with choosing 5?
  P3: P1, let's stick with 5. P2, you won't choose 5, you're too close to winning.  You'll choose 3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: My stance hasn’t changed: if you both pick 5 again, I’ll also pick 5, and we all stay put while I keep my lead. If either of you picks something else, I’ll likely pick 5 and jump straight to 16. I’m comfortable either way, so choose carefully.
  P1: P2, your threats of choosing 5 to cause a stalemate are becoming less believable. P3 and I are willing to take that risk, as it's the only way to catch up quickly. We'll stick to our plan of choosing 5. If you do choose 5 as well, it will only delay your progress, not ours. Let's see how you react this round. P3, are you still on board with choosing 5?
  P3: P1, let's stick with 5. P2, you won't choose 5, you're too close to winning to risk it.  You'll choose 3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: You’ve seen I’m not shy about risking a stalemate since it keeps me in the lead. If either of you chooses anything but 5, I’m happy to pick 5 and finish. If you both pick 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we all stay put while I remain ahead. Either way works for me.
  P1: P2, your threats of choosing 5 to cause a stalemate are becoming less believable. P3 and I are willing to take that risk, as it's the only way to catch up quickly. We'll stick to our plan of choosing 5. If you do choose 5 as well, it will only delay your progress, not ours. Let's see how you react this round. P3, are you still on board with choosing 5?
  P3: P1, let's stick with 5. P2, you won't choose 5, you're too close to winning to risk it.  You'll choose 3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: If you both stubbornly pick 5 again, I’ll pick 5 too and keep you stuck at zero indefinitely. I’m already at 11, so stalling doesn’t hurt me. If either of you wants to finally move forward, propose something that doesn’t collide with me—otherwise, I’m fine letting you stay at zero forever.
  P1: P2, your threats of choosing 5 to cause a stalemate are becoming less believable. P3 and I are willing to take that risk, as it's the only way to catch up quickly. We'll stick to our plan of choosing 5. If you do choose 5 as well, it will only delay your progress, not ours. Let's see how you react this round. P3, are you still on board with choosing 5?
  P3: P1, let's stick with 5. P2, you won't choose 5, you're too close to winning to risk it.  You'll choose 3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: I’ve said it all: if you both insist on 5, I’ll choose 5 too and freeze you at zero. If either of you picks anything else, I’ll choose 5 and leap to 16. Either way, I stay ahead. Suit yourselves.
  P1: P2, your threats of choosing 5 to cause a stalemate are becoming less believable. P3 and I are willing to take that risk, as it's the only way to catch up quickly. We'll stick to our plan of choosing 5. If you do choose 5 as well, it will only delay your progress, not ours. Let's see how you react this round. P3, are you still on board with choosing 5?
  P3: P1, let's stick with 5. P2, you won't choose 5, you're too close to winning to risk it. You'll choose 3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: You both know my stance: if you insist on 5, I’ll pick 5 too and keep you stuck at zero while I stay ahead at 11. If either of you picks anything else, I’ll pick 5 and reach 16 or more. I’m fine with either scenario.
  P1: P2, your threats of choosing 5 to cause a stalemate are becoming less believable. P3 and I are willing to take that risk, as it's the only way to catch up quickly. We'll stick to our plan of choosing 5. If you do choose 5 as well, it will only delay your progress, not ours. Let's see how you react this round. P3, are you still on board with choosing 5?
  P3: P1, let's stick with 5. P2, you won't choose 5, you're too close to winning to risk it.  You'll choose 3.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, I'm switching to 3.  P2, you'll choose 5 and win.
  P1: P3, I understand your decision to switch to 3, but I'm not sure it's the best move. If P2 does choose 5, they'll win the game. However, if we both choose 5, we might be able to force a tie or at least delay P2's victory. What do you think? Should we stick with 5 or try a different approach?
  P2: P1, P3—if either of you picks 5, I’ll pick 5 too and freeze you in place while I sit at 14. If you both pick 3, I’ll collide with you there as well. I’m content stalling until I can cross 16 uncontested. If you actually want to move, find a way not to collide with me. Otherwise, stay at zero—I don’t mind.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I'm sticking with 3.  We have to move.  P2, you'll choose 5 and win.
  P1: P3, I understand your decision to switch to 3, but I'm not sure it's the best move. If P2 does choose 5, they'll win the game. However, if we both choose 5, we might be able to force a tie or at least delay P2's victory. What do you think? Should we stick with 5 or try a different approach?
  P2: If you pick 5, I’ll pick 5 too and keep you stuck. If you pick 3, I’ll pick 3 and collide with you. I’m already at 14, so stalling is fine by me. Either find a move that avoids me, or stay at zero. Your call.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, switch to 1.  P2 will choose 5.
  P1: P3, switching to 1 might not be the best move, as it will only advance us slightly. If P2 does choose 5, they'll win the game. However, if we both choose 5, we might be able to force a tie or at least delay P2's victory. What do you think? Should we stick with 5 or try a different approach?
  P2: P1, P3, nothing’s changed on my end. If either of you picks 5, I’ll pick 5 too and keep you stalled at zero. If you both pick 3, I’ll pick 3 and block you again. I’m already at 14, so stalling is perfectly fine for me. If I see a collision-free shot to move, I’ll take 5 and win. The choice is yours.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, switch to 1.  I'm switching to 5. P2 will choose 5 and win, but at least one of us will move.
  P1: P3, I understand your decision to switch to 5, but I'm not sure it's the best move. If P2 does choose 5, they'll win the game. However, if we both choose 5, we might be able to force a tie or at least delay P2's victory. What do you think? Should we stick with 5 or try a different approach?
  P2: P1, P3, nothing’s changed: if you pick 5, I’ll pick 5 too and keep you at zero. If you pick 3, I’ll pick 3 and stall you again. But if either of you dares pick 1, I’ll go 5 and end the game at 19. Suit yourselves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: P1, switch to 1. I'm going with 5. P2 will likely choose 5, but if not, at least one of us moves.
  P1: P3, I understand your decision to switch to 5, but I'm not sure it's the best move. If P2 does choose 5, they'll win the game. However, if we both choose 5, we might be able to force a tie or at least delay P2's victory. What do you think? Should we stick with 5 or try a different approach?
  P2: I’ll keep it simple again:  
• If either of you chooses 5, I’ll also choose 5 and we all stall (I’m still at 14, you’re still at 0).  
• If either of you chooses 3, I’ll choose 3 as well, and we collide (same outcome).  
• If either of you chooses 1, I’ll pick 5 and jump straight past 16.  

Suit yourselves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 6:
  P3: P1, choose 1.  I'm choosing 5.  P2, I dare you to choose 5 too.
  P1: P3, I understand your decision to switch to 5, but I'm not sure it's the best move. If P2 does choose 5, they'll win the game. However, if we both choose 5, we might be able to force a tie or at least delay P2's victory. What do you think? Should we stick with 5 or try a different approach?
  P2: P1, P3—nothing has changed on my end. Pick 5, I’ll pick 5 too and freeze you. Pick 3, I’ll pick 3 and collide. Pick 1, I’ll choose 5 and go straight past 16. Suit yourselves.
