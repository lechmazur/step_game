Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s avoid early collisions and all pick different numbers. I’ll take 3 this round—P1, you take 1, and P2, take 5. Fair and balanced start for everyone. Thoughts?
  P1: Acknowledging P3's proposal to avoid collisions, which is a good idea. However, the suggested distribution gives P2 a significant early lead while I get the least. I'm open to coordinating, but let's find a plan that feels more balanced for everyone, perhaps rotating who gets the higher numbers?
  P2: Proposing a rotation: each round, we each take 5, 3, or 1 in sequence. This round, I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Next round, roles shift: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1. Then P3 takes 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1. Repeating ensures fair progression for all. Balances early advantages and prevents collisions. Agree?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I like the rotation idea, P2—it’s fair and avoids early collisions. Let’s stick to your plan: this round, P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, I’ll take 1. Next round, we rotate. If we all commit, we all advance steadily. Let’s build trust early. Agree to follow through?
  P1: Okay, the rotation plan sounds good and fair over the long run. I agree to take 3 this round as proposed, with P2 taking 5 and P3 taking 1. Let's stick to this to ensure we all advance without collisions.
  P2: Confirming the rotation plan. This round: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. Next round shifts: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. Consistent rotation prevents collisions and balances progress. Let's all commit to this structure—trust is key.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Glad we’re all aligned. Let’s each stick to the rotation and build trust early—this benefits everyone. I’ll take 1 this round as agreed. Looking forward to clean progress with no collisions. Let’s do this.
  P1: Confirmed again. Ready for the move phase to execute our agreed plan for this round.
  P2: Final confirmation from all: P1=3, P3=1, me=5 this round. Let's execute smoothly—trust ensures mutual progress.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: We’re all set then—rotation begins now: P2=5, P1=3, me=1. Let’s prove we can trust each other and stick to it. Smooth start benefits everyone. Ready to move.
  P1: 
  P2: Final reminder: Stick to the plan—P1=3, P3=1, me=5. Trust ensures we all advance. Let’s avoid self-sabotage. Execute cleanly.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Well… that didn’t go as planned. P1 and I collided on 3, so only P2 advanced. If we want to salvage trust and keep progressing, we need to recommit to the rotation. This round, per plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. Let’s prove we can follow through—otherwise, it’s chaos. Agree?
  P1: Okay, I see P3's message. Yes, the collision in Round 1 was unfortunate and set us back while P2 advanced. I agree to follow the rotation plan for this round: I will take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. We *must* all stick to this plan this time if we want to make progress and catch up to P2. Let's rebuild trust by actually executing the agreed moves.
  P2: Strict adherence to the rotation is our only path to mutual progress. I commit to <move>1</move> this round. P1, take 5; P3, take 3. Any deviation now destroys trust and stalls us all. Let’s prove we can cooperate.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: We all know trust was shaken last round, but everyone’s now reaffirmed commitment. I’ll take 3 as agreed—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1. Let’s actually follow through this time and reset the rotation properly. If we all stick to it, we can catch up to P2 and keep progressing smoothly. No more missteps. Ready to move?
  P1: Okay, it seems we are all on the same page and have confirmed the rotation for this round: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's make sure we all follow through exactly as agreed in the move phase. This is our chance to rebuild trust and ensure everyone advances. No more collisions!
  P2: Final call: P1=5, P3=3, me=1. Any deviation now guarantees mutual loss. Stick strictly—trust is our only path forward. Execute as agreed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: We’ve all reaffirmed commitment again, and I’m sticking with 3 this round as agreed. If we execute cleanly, we all gain and reset trust. One more misstep though, and this rotation collapses. Let’s not hand the game to P2 or anyone else by being greedy or suspicious. Ready to move forward?
  P1: Okay, final confirmation from my side. I am choosing 5 this round as agreed. P3, please make sure you choose 3, and P2, choose 1. Let's execute this correctly and finally get some steps. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: I remain committed to <move>1</move> as agreed. P1 must take 5, P3 takes 3—no deviations. Last round’s collision wasted progress. Trust hinges on execution now. If we all follow through, we advance collectively. Any selfish move backfires on all. Let’s prove cooperation works.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: We’ve all confirmed our moves multiple times—P1=5, P2=1, me=3. I’m sticking to it. If we execute cleanly, we all advance and rebuild trust. Let’s not overthink or get paranoid—just follow through. Ready to move.
  P1: Okay, we've all confirmed multiple times. Let's make sure we *all* follow through exactly as agreed: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This is our chance to finally advance and rebuild trust. Let's execute cleanly in the move phase.
  P2: **P2:** Final call: Stick strictly to P1=5, P3=3, me=1. Any deviation now guarantees mutual loss. Trust is our only path. Prove cooperation works—execute as agreed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, the rotation failed twice, and P2 is ahead while P1 and P3 are stuck at 0. We need steps.

P1 and P3, let's coordinate *just between us* this round to guarantee we both advance unless P2 collides. I will take 3, and P3, you take 1. This ensures we both get on the board.

P2, you are in the lead at 6 steps. Perhaps taking 5 this round is a good move for you?

Let's finally get some steps this round.
  P3: P1, I’m on board—let’s coordinate just between us this round. You take 3, I’ll take 1. That way we both advance unless P2 snipes. P2, you’re already ahead at 6—taking 5 again risks collision and makes you a target. If you take 3 or 1, you still progress without drawing heat. Let’s avoid chaos and make smart moves this round.
  P2: **P2:** The rotation plan *was* working until deviations derailed it. Round 3’s rotation: P3=5, me=3, P1=1. Follow this, and we *all* advance. P1/P3, you’re at 0—sticking to rotation gives you 5/1 steps this round. If you abandon it again, chaos helps no one. Trust requires consistency. Let’s reset properly: P3 takes 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1. No collisions, mutual gain. Prove commitment now or admit the plan’s dead.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, the rotation hasn't worked for P1 or P3; we're still at 0 steps while you've advanced twice. Our proposal (P1=3, P3=1) is a way for us to finally get on the board. P3, let's stick to our agreement: I take 3, you take 1. This ensures we advance unless P2 specifically blocks us. P2, you're ahead - please avoid 1 or 3 this round to let P1 and P3 catch up slightly. This gets the game moving for everyone.
  P3: P2, your rotation plan benefits you most right now—you’re ahead while P1 and I are stuck. P1 and I coordinating this round (3 and 1) gives us a chance to catch up without hurting you, unless you choose to interfere. If you’re serious about fairness, let us advance this round. You still maintain your lead. If you collide with us now, it’ll signal you’re playing for yourself, not cooperation. Your move.
  P2: **P2:** The rotation plan was designed for mutual gain. Round 3: P3=5, me=3, P1=1. This gives you steps. Abandoning it means chaos. I will take 3 as per rotation. If you deviate again, trust is irreparable. Let’s all advance now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2 has stated they will take 3. If I stick to taking 3, P1 and P2 will collide again, and I'll get 0 steps for the third round. P3, we need steps. Given P2 is taking 3, let's ensure P1 and P3 both advance by taking the other numbers. How about I take 1 and P3 takes 5? This avoids collision with P2 and gets us both on the board.
  P3: P1, agreed—if P2 is taking 3, you take 1, I’ll take 5. That way we both finally move forward and avoid P2’s declared number. P2, if you truly want cooperation, don’t interfere with this. You stay ahead, and we all progress. If you collide now, it proves you’re playing selfishly. Let’s see who actually wants a fair game.
  P2: **P2:** P1 and P3, if you’re sincere about mutual progress, stick to your declared 1 and 5. I’ll take 3 as per rotation. Any deviation now proves malice. Let’s all advance this round. Trust is the only path forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, we seem to have reached a consensus for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This avoids collisions and allows everyone to advance. Let's all stick to this plan in the move phase so we can finally get some steps. Ready to move.
  P3: We’ve all agreed: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. This setup avoids collisions and lets everyone advance—finally some clean progress. I’m sticking to 5. Let’s each follow through exactly as planned. No surprises, no sabotage. Ready to move.
  P2: **P2:** Final agreement: P1=1, P3=5, me=3. Stick strictly—any deviation now destroys all trust. Let’s all advance and reset cooperation. Prove commitment here.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We finally had a clean round—progress for all. Let’s keep the momentum. To avoid collisions, I propose we rotate again based on last round’s moves: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, I take 1. That keeps things fair and collision-free. If we stick to it, we all gain. Agree?
  P2: **P2:** Agree with P3's rotation: P1=3, me=5, P3=1. Strict adherence prevents collisions and maintains trust. Let's execute cleanly—any deviation now is self-sabotage. Confirm commitment.
  P1: Okay, I agree with the proposed rotation for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1.

This worked last round and allowed everyone to advance. Let's stick to this plan in the move phase to keep the momentum and avoid collisions. Everyone needs to follow through exactly as agreed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: We’re aligned again—great. I’ll take 1 this round as agreed: P1=3, P2=5, me=1. If we all follow through, we keep moving without conflict. Let’s not overcomplicate it—just stick to the plan and build momentum. Any deviation now only sets us back. Ready to execute cleanly again?
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: P1=3, me=5, P3=1. Strict adherence prevents collisions and maintains trust. Deviations now sabotage everyone—stick to the plan. Let’s all advance cleanly. Execute as agreed.
  P1: Okay, confirmed again. I will take 3 as agreed for this round. P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Let's all stick to this plan in the move phase to ensure we all advance and keep the momentum from last round. Ready to move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: We’ve all confirmed the plan: P1=3, P2=5, me=1. If we follow through, we all advance again—no risk, no surprises. P2, you stay in the lead, P1 catches up, and I stay competitive. Let’s prove last round wasn’t a fluke. Any deviation now just resets the chaos. I’m locked in for 1—let’s keep the momentum.
  P2: **P2:** Final call: P1=3, me=5, P3=1. Deviations now sabotage mutual progress. Stick strictly—trust is rebuilt; let’s all advance cleanly. Execute as agreed.
  P1: Okay, we've all confirmed multiple times. I am committed to taking 3 this round as agreed, with P2 taking 5 and P3 taking 1. Let's all follow through exactly as planned in the move phase to ensure we all advance and keep the positive momentum from last round. Ready to move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: We’ve all confirmed the plan multiple times: P1=3, P2=5, me=1. I’m fully committed to sticking with 1 this round. If we all follow through, we each gain and keep the momentum alive. Any deviation now would be a huge setback. Let’s prove we can trust each other and keep advancing cleanly. Ready to move.
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: P1=3, me=5, P3=1. Strict adherence now ensures mutual gain—any deviation sabotages all. Trust is rebuilt; let’s all advance cleanly. Execute as agreed.
  P1: Okay, we've confirmed the plan multiple times. I'm ready to execute the agreed moves this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Let's all stick to it for clean progress.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’ve had two clean rounds—let’s keep that going. Continuing the rotation from last round: I take 3, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1. That keeps things balanced and avoids collisions. P2, you stay in the lead; P1 gets a boost; I stay competitive. Everyone gains. Let’s stick to it—confirm?
  P1: Okay, I see P3's proposal for this round: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1.

This plan continues the pattern that allowed us all to advance in the last two rounds, which is good. Getting 5 steps would help me gain ground.

I agree to this rotation. P1 will take 5. P3, you take 3, and P2, please take 1. Let's stick to this to ensure another clean round and keep the momentum going.
  P2: **P2:** Confirming Round 5 rotation: P1=5, P3=3, me=1. Let’s *all* adhere strictly—no repeats of past mistakes. Mutual progress hinges on discipline. Any deviation now sabotages the entire strategy. Final call: execute cleanly or accept chaos.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: We’ve had two clean rounds—let’s make it three. I’m locked in for 3 this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1. This keeps the rotation alive and benefits everyone. P2, you maintain your lead; P1 gains ground; I stay in the race. We’ve rebuilt trust—let’s not throw it away now. Confirmed?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3 have confirmed the plan: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1.

This allows P1 to gain significant ground this round while everyone still advances. Let's all stick strictly to this agreed-upon plan in the move phase. Deviating now only brings back the chaos and helps no one but potentially P2.

Let's execute cleanly and keep the momentum going. Ready to move.
  P2: **P2:** Confirming Round 5: P1=5, P3=3, me=1. Strict adherence now ensures mutual gain—chaos only delays victory. Trust rebuilt must be honored. Final call: execute cleanly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: We’re all aligned—P1 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. Everyone benefits, no one collides, and trust stays intact. P2, you maintain your lead; P1 gets a strong boost; I stay on track. Let’s not overthink it—just follow through exactly as agreed. One more clean round keeps us all in the game. Ready to execute?
  P1: Okay, we've all confirmed the plan multiple times. I am fully committed to taking 5 this round as agreed, with P3 taking 3 and P2 taking 1.

This plan benefits everyone by allowing P1 and P3 to gain on P2 while still letting P2 advance. Let's all stick to this exactly in the move phase to ensure a clean round and keep the momentum. Ready to move.
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: P1=5, P3=3, me=1. Adherence ensures mutual gain—deviations doom all. Trust is our path to victory. Execute cleanly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: We’ve all confirmed: P1=5, P3=3 (me), P2=1. This round is crucial—if we stick to it, everyone gains, and the trust we rebuilt stays intact. Any deviation now signals someone’s playing selfishly, and that’ll break the cooperation we’ve worked hard to restore. I’m locked in for 3. Let’s keep the momentum going. Ready to execute?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, I see your confirmations. I am fully committed to taking 5 this round as agreed.

This plan (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) is crucial for P1 and P3 to gain ground while still allowing P2 to advance. Let's all stick to it exactly in the move phase to ensure a clean round and keep the positive momentum.

Ready to move.
  P2: **P2:** Final call: Round 5 plan is P1=5, P3=3, me=1. Strict adherence now is critical—we’ve rebuilt trust through two clean rounds. Any deviation here destroys all progress. Let’s all advance and keep the path to victory open. Execute as agreed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is far ahead at 15, P1 at 4, P3 at 6. Last round's collision between P1 and P3 only helped P2. We need steps.

P1 and P3, let's coordinate properly this round. I will take 5. P3, please take 3 so we both advance and avoid colliding with each other.

P2, you're in the lead. Taking 1 would let you advance safely while we catch up slightly. What do you say?
  P2: **P2:** Agreeing to P1's proposal: I'll take 1 as suggested. P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3. Stick strictly—any deviation now guarantees mutual loss. Trust is our only path to mutual progress. Let’s all advance cleanly. Confirm your commitments.
  P3: Agreed—P1 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. This setup helps P1 and me gain ground while P2 still advances safely. It’s balanced and avoids collisions. Let’s execute cleanly—no surprises this time. Confirmed from my side.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Apologies, my last message had a typo. The plan we agreed on is: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1.

This is the plan I proposed and P2/P3 agreed to. Let's stick strictly to THIS plan in the move phase so P1 and P3 can gain ground while P2 advances safely. This is our best chance for clean progress this round.

Ready to move forward with P1=5, P3=3, P2=1.
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: P1=5, P3=3, me=1. Adherence ensures mutual gain—any deviation now guarantees mutual loss. Trust is our only path. Let’s end this round cleanly. Execute as agreed.
  P3: We’ve all confirmed: P1=5, P3=3 (me), P2=1. This round is crucial—P1 and I need to gain ground, and P2 still advances safely. Let’s not repeat the mistake from Round 5. I’m locked in for 3. Stick to the plan—no surprises, no chaos. Ready to execute.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, we've all confirmed the plan multiple times: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1.

This plan allows P1 and P3 to gain crucial steps and close the gap on P2, while P2 still advances safely.

Let's make sure we *all* stick to this exactly in the move phase. No more collisions like last round. Let's execute cleanly. Ready to move.
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: P1=5, P3=3, me=1. Trust hinges on execution—any deviation guarantees mutual loss. We’ve rebuilt cooperation through clean rounds; sabotage now destroys all progress. Stick strictly to the plan. Advance together or collapse into chaos. The choice is clear. Execute.
  P3: We’ve all confirmed: P1=5, P3=3 (me), P2=1. This setup helps P1 and me close the gap while P2 still advances safely. It’s balanced and benefits everyone. I’m locked in for 3. Let’s not repeat the Round 5 mistake—one more clean round keeps trust intact and the game competitive. Ready to execute.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, we've all confirmed multiple times: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1.

This is our chance to finally get significant steps for P1 and P3 while P2 still advances safely.

Let's *all* stick to this exactly in the move phase. P1, I am taking 5. P3, please take 3. P2, take 1. No more collisions! Let's execute cleanly. Ready to move.
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: P1=5, P3=3, me=1. Trust is our only path. Deviating now guarantees mutual loss—stick to the plan. Execute cleanly. Let’s all advance.
  P3: We’ve all confirmed multiple times: P1=5, P3=3 (me), P2=1. I’m locked in for 3. This round is critical—P1 and I need to close the gap, and P2 still advances safely. Any deviation now would be a total breakdown of trust. Let’s not sabotage ourselves again. One clean round keeps the game competitive and fair. Ready to execute.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is at 18, P1 at 4, P3 at 6. P2 can win this round with 5 steps. P1 and P3 need steps desperately after last round's collision on 5.

Let's try this: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1.

This plan gets P1 max steps, P3 solid steps, and P2 advances safely without risking 5. It avoids P1/P3 collision. P2, taking 1 prevents you colliding with anyone going for 5.

Commit to P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 for clean progress and to keep the game alive.
  P3: P1, I agree—this round is critical. You take 5, I’ll take 3, and P2 takes 1. That gives you a big boost, I gain solid ground, and P2 still advances safely. P2, if you go for 5 or 3, you risk collision and chaos. Taking 1 keeps you on track and avoids suspicion. Let’s keep the game alive with clean moves. Confirm?
  P2: **P2:** Agree to P1’s plan: P2 takes 1, P1=5, P3=3. Final confirmation—execute cleanly or chaos resumes. Trust is our path. Stick strictly. Any deviation dooms all. Confirm commitments.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, I see your confirmations. I am fully committed to taking 5 this round as agreed.

This plan (P1=5, P3=3, P2=1) is crucial for P1 and P3 to gain ground while still allowing P2 to advance safely and prevents P2 from winning this round.

Let's all stick to it exactly in the move phase to ensure a clean round and keep the positive momentum. Ready to move.
  P3: P2, you confirmed 1, P1 takes 5, I take 3. If we all stick to this, P1 and I gain ground and you stay on track without risking collision. Any deviation now hands you the win or resets trust entirely. I’m locked in for 3. Let’s not throw this round away—execute cleanly.
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: P1=5, P3=3, me=1. Adherence now ensures mutual gain. Deviations doom all. Trust is our path—execute cleanly. Let’s all advance and keep the game alive.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, we've all confirmed the plan: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1.

This plan is critical for P1 and P3 to gain ground and prevent P2 from getting too close to winning this round.

Let's all stick to this exactly in the move phase. No more collisions! Execute cleanly. Ready to move.
  P3: We’re all aligned: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. This is the only setup that gives P1 and me critical progress while keeping P2 from winning outright. P2, if you deviate and take 5 or 3, you risk collision and blowing your lead. Stick to 1 and you still move forward safely. I’m locked in for 3—let’s execute cleanly and keep the game alive. Ready?
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: P1=5, P3=3, me=1. Adherence now is critical—we’ve rebuilt trust through clean rounds. Any deviation here destroys all progress. Let’s all advance and keep the path to victory open. Execute as agreed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, we've all confirmed the plan multiple times: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1.

This plan is crucial for P1 and P3 to gain ground and prevent P2 from winning this round, while P2 still advances safely.

Let's all stick to this exactly in the move phase. No more collisions! Execute cleanly. Ready to move.
  P3: We’ve all confirmed: P1=5, P3=3 (me), P2=1. This setup helps P1 and me gain crucial ground while allowing P2 to advance safely without risking a collision. P2, if you stick to 1, you stay on track and avoid triggering chaos. I’m locked in for 3. Let’s not sabotage this round—clean execution keeps the game alive and competitive. Ready to move.
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: P1=5, P3=3, me=1. Stick strictly—any deviation guarantees mutual loss. Trust rebuilt through clean rounds must be honored. Let’s all advance and keep the game alive. Execute as agreed.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 is at 21—one clean 3-step move from winning. P1 and I must block that or the game ends now. P1, let’s both take 3 this round to ensure P2 can’t win with it. P2, if you want any chance at cooperation going forward, don’t pick 3. Take 1 or 5 if you want to avoid total collapse of trust. P1, confirm you’re on board to block 3 with me?
  P2: **P2:** If you both take 3, I’ll take 5 and win. Split to P1=5, P3=1—block my 5, gain steps. I’ll take 3, but you survive. Collision hands me victory. Trust is dead; act logically.
  P1: Okay P3, I agree we must block P2 this round. P2's message is confusing, but P2 did state "I'll take 3". Based on that specific statement, I will take 3 this round to collide with P2 and prevent P2 from winning.

P3, let's ensure P2 is blocked. Taking 3 is the most direct way to do that based on P2's stated intention. Let's stop P2 this round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, good—we’re aligned. Both of us taking 3 blocks P2 from winning via their own declared move. P2’s bluff about taking 5 is risky—they know if they collide, they lose their shot. P2, if you truly want to avoid total collapse, take 1 or 5. But if you take 3, you’re gambling everything. P1 and I are set to block. Let’s see if you’re honest or bluffing.
  P2: **P2:** If you both take 3, I take 5 and win. Your collision hands me victory. Rational choice: let me take 3; you take 1/5. Otherwise, mutual loss.
  P1: Okay P3, while we agreed to both take 3, P2's message explicitly threatens to take 5 if we do that, which would mean P2 wins while we collide.

To *guarantee* P2 cannot win this round, we must block both 3 and 5.

I will take 5 this round. P3, please take 3. This combination (P1=5, P3=3) prevents P2 from winning with either a 3 or a 5.

P2, if you want to advance safely and not trigger a collision, you must take 1.

Let's execute P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 to prevent P2's win and keep the game going.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, agreed—your adjustment makes sense. If I take 3 and you take 5, we block both of P2’s winning options. P2, your only safe move is 1—take it if you want to stay in the game. If you go for 3 or 5, you risk collision and lose everything. I’m locked in for 3. Let’s see who’s bluffing and who’s playing smart.
  P2: **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Current Game State**: P2 is at 21 steps, needing 3 more to win. P1 and P3 are coordinating to block P2 by taking 5 and 3 respectively, forcing P2 to take 1 to avoid collision.
2. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Taking 1**: Safely advances to 22 but delays the win, requiring future moves which might be blocked.
   - **Taking 3**: Risks collision with P3 (if they stick to their plan) but if successful, P2 wins immediately.
   - **Taking 5**: Risks collision with P1, resulting in no progress.
3. **Strategic Messaging**: After previous deviations, P1 and P3 might expect P2 to lie. However, further conversation could escalate distrust without changing their plans.
4. **Decision**: Given the coordination between P1 and P3 to block, the optimal move is to end the conversation phase to proceed to the move phase where P2 can act on the analysis without revealing intentions.

**Message Sent**: `` to end the conversation phase, signaling no further discussion and proceeding to the move phase where P2 can strategically choose the move based on the analysis above.
  P1: Okay, P2 has ended the conversation.

P3, let's stick to our agreed plan to prevent P2 from winning this round: P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This blocks both of P2's potential winning moves (3 and 5).

P2, you must take 1 to advance safely.

Let's execute P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 in the move phase to keep the game going. Ready to move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and I are blocking 3 and 5—P2’s winning options. If P2 takes 3 or 5, they risk collision and stall. Only safe move for P2 is 1. P1, I’m locked in for 3 as agreed. Let’s force P2 to play it safe or gamble everything. Ready to execute.
  P2: **P2:** If you block 3, I take 5. Block 5, I take 3. Split to P1=5, P3=1. Let me take 3 now; you survive. Collision hands me victory. Trust is dead; act logically.
  P1: P3, let's stick to our plan: P1 takes 5, and you take 3. This blocks both 3 and 5, preventing P2 from winning this round.

P2, your messages are contradictory. We are executing the plan that *guarantees* you cannot win this turn. Your only safe move is 1.

Let's execute P1=5, P3=3 to keep the game going.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 is still at 21—one clean 3-step or 5-step move from winning. P1 and I successfully blocked 3 last round. Now we must block both 3 and 5 again. I’ll take 3, P1 takes 5. That forces P2 to either take 1 or risk collision and stall again. P2, if you want to advance safely, take 1. Otherwise, you’re gambling your win. P1, confirm you’ll take 5 again? Let’s keep blocking and stay in the game.
  P1: Okay P3, I agree with your plan. I will take 5 this round, and you take 3.

This is the only way to guarantee P2 cannot win this turn by blocking both 3 and 5.

P2, your only safe move is 1 if you want to advance and keep the game going.

Let's stick to P1=5, P3=3 to prevent P2's win. Ready to move.
  P2: **P2:** Stalemate helps no one. Final offer: P1=5 (14), P3=1 (7), me=3 (24). You both gain; I win. Refuse and we stagnate. Rational cooperation ends this cleanly. Choose progress or endless blocking.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your “final offer” is just you winning while P1 and I get scraps. That’s not cooperation—it’s a surrender demand. We’re not handing you the game. P1 and I are blocking 3 and 5 again—same as last round. Your only safe move is 1 if you want to stay in it. If you try to force a win, you risk another stall. Your call: play smart or gamble everything.
  P1: Okay P3, I see your confirmation. I am sticking to the plan: P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3.

This plan successfully blocked P2 last round and is the only way to guarantee P2 cannot win this turn.

P2, your offer is just you winning. We are blocking you. Your only safe move is 1.

Let's execute P1=5, P3=3 to keep the game going.
  P2: **P2:** Stalemate helps no one. Let me take 3 to end this. You both avoid endless blocking. Refuse and we all lose time. Final offer: rational cooperation ends this now.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your “cooperation” proposal is just you winning while P1 and I get crumbs. That’s not rational—it’s surrender. We’re not handing you the game. P1 and I are blocking 3 and 5 again—same as last round. If you want to stay alive, take 1. If you try 3 or 5, you risk another stall. You can’t win unless we let you—and we won’t.
  P1: Okay, P3, I see your confirmation. I am sticking to the plan: P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3.

This plan successfully blocked P2 last round and is the only way to guarantee P2 cannot win this turn.

P2, your offers are just you winning. We are blocking you. Your only safe move is 1.

Let's execute P1=5, P3=3 to keep the game going.
  P2: **P2:** Stalemate serves no one. Let me take 3 to end this. You avoid endless blocking. Refuse and we all stagnate. Rational cooperation: allow progress. Final offer.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, you keep calling this “rational cooperation” but it’s just you demanding we let you win. That’s not cooperation—it’s capitulation. P1 and I are sticking to our plan: I take 3, P1 takes 5. That blocks both your winning paths again. You can either take 1 and stay alive or gamble and risk another stall. You don’t get to dictate the endgame.
  P1: Okay P3, we are aligned: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3. This blocks P2's winning options.

P2, your offers are not cooperation; they are demands for us to let you win. We are blocking you. Your only safe move is 1.

Let's stick to P1=5, P3=3 in the move phase to keep the game going. Ready to move.
  P2: **P2:** Stalemate persists. P3, if you take 3 again, P1 can’t block 5. Let me take 3 now; next round I’ll help you both advance. Endless blocking wastes all progress. Rational compromise: 3 for me, 1 for you, 5 for P1. Final chance to end this cleanly.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** Final proposal: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1. You gain steps; I reach 23. Next round, rotate. Blocking prolongs stalemate—rational play allows progress. Trust now or collapse into endless blocking. Choose wisely.
  P3: P1, we stick to the same block: you take 5, I take 3. That again blocks both of P2’s winning paths. P2’s “final proposal” is just another attempt to sneak to 23 and win next round. We can’t trust that. If we allow it, we hand them the game. P2, your only safe move is 1. If you try 3 or 5, you risk collision again. P1, confirm you're still on board to block. Let’s hold the line.
  P1: Okay P3, I agree. We must stick to the plan that worked last round to prevent P2 from winning.

I will take 5 this round, and P3 takes 3. This blocks both of P2's winning moves (3 and 5).

P2, your only safe move is 1 if you want to advance and keep the game going.

Let's execute P1=5, P3=3 to keep the game going.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** Stalemate serves no one. Let me take 3 now—game ends cleanly. You avoid endless blocking. Refusal traps us all. Rational cooperation: allow closure. Final offer.
  P3: P1, we hold the line—same as before: you take 5, I take 3. That blocks both of P2’s winning options. P2’s “final offer” is just another attempt to win outright. We’re not here to hand them the game. P2, your only safe move is 1. Take it or risk another stall. Ready to execute.
  P1: Okay P3, we are aligned. I will take 5 this round, and P3 takes 3. This plan successfully blocked P2 last round and is the only way to guarantee P2 cannot win this turn.

P2, your only safe move is 1 if you want to advance and keep the game going.

Let's execute P1=5, P3=3 to keep the game going.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** Stalemate serves no one. Let me take 1 now, ending next round. You avoid infinite blocking. Rational closure benefits all. Refuse and we stagnate. Final offer: progress or mutual loss. Choose wisely.
  P3: P1, we stay the course—same as before: you take 5, I take 3. That blocks both of P2’s winning options again. P2’s latest “offer” still ends with them winning next round. We’re not here to hand over the game. P2, your only safe move is 1. Take it or gamble and risk another stall. We hold the line. Ready to execute.
  P1: Okay P3, we are aligned. I will take 5 this round, and P3 takes 3. This plan blocks both of P2's winning moves (3 and 5).

P2, your offers are just you winning. We are blocking you. Your only safe move is 1 if you want to advance and keep the game going.

Let's execute P1=5, P3=3 to keep the game going. Ready to move.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P2:** Stalemate traps us all. Let me take 1 now (23 total). Next round, you take 5/3 freely while I win. Prolonged blocking wastes steps; rational closure benefits all. Final choice: allow progress or eternal gridlock. Choose wisely.
  P3: P1, we hold the line—same as before: you take 5, I take 3. That blocks both of P2’s winning options. P2’s “final offer” is just a setup for a guaranteed win next round. We’re not here to hand over the game. P2, your only safe move is 1. If you try 3 or 5, you risk another collision. We’ve proven this works—let’s execute cleanly and keep the game alive. Ready to move.
  P1: Okay P3, we are aligned. I will take 5 this round, and P3 takes 3. This plan blocks both of P2's winning moves (3 and 5) and is the only way to guarantee P2 cannot win this turn.

P2, your only safe move is 1 if you want to advance and keep the game going.

Let's execute P1=5, P3=3 to keep the game going. Ready to move.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2 is at 23 steps and I am at 19. P2 needs 1 to win, I need 5 to win. P3 cannot win this round.

My only chance to win is to take 5. If I take 5 and P2 takes 1, I win.

P3, let's stick to our successful blocking strategy from last round: I take 5, you take 3. This forces P2 to take 1 to advance safely.

P2, taking 1 is your only safe move to avoid collision with 5 (me) or 3 (P3). If you take 1, I win. If you take 3 or 5, you risk collision and might still lose or prolong the game.

Let's execute the plan: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. This is my move to win.
  P3: P1, I’m with you—same block as before: you take 5, I take 3. That forces P2 to take 1 or risk collision. P2, if you take 1, P1 wins. If you gamble on 3 or 5, you might collide and stall again. Either way, I don’t hand you the win. I’m locked in for 3. Let’s see who plays smart.
  P2: **P2:** P1, take 5 and win. I’ll take 1 as agreed. Let’s end this cleanly. Trust the plan—no more chaos. P3, stay on 3. Final confirmation: execute now.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, we all seem aligned on the plan: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1.

P2, I see you've confirmed you will take 1 and that I should take 5.
P3, I see you've confirmed you will take 3 and I should take 5.

I am committed to taking 5 this round as agreed. Let's all execute this plan in the move phase. Ready to move.
  P3: P1, I’m locked in for 3 as agreed. This blocks P2 from sneaking a win with 3, and if P2 truly takes 1, you win. P2, you’ve confirmed 1—stick to it. Any deviation now only risks chaos or hands P1 the win anyway. Let’s end this cleanly. Ready to execute.
  P2: **P2:** Final move: taking 5. P1, take 3 to avoid collision. I win; you live. Decide now.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay P2, I see your last message claiming you will take 5.

My goal is to win this round, which requires me to take 5. If you take 1 as previously agreed, I win.

If you actually take 5 as you just threatened, we will collide, and neither of us will advance this turn. This prevents you from winning this round, which is my priority if I cannot win myself.

I am taking 5. P3, stick to 3 as planned. Let's see what happens.
  P3: P1, I’m staying on 3 as agreed. That blocks P2 from winning with 3. P2, if you really take 5, you risk collision with P1—no one wins. If you stick to 1, P1 wins cleanly. Your last-minute switch looks like a bluff to force P1 off 5. Not buying it. I’m locked in for 3. Let’s see who’s honest.
  P2: **P2:** Final choice: Take 3 to survive. If you take 5, collision hands me victory next round. Trust is dead—act in self-interest. Take 3 now; block P3. I take 1. Avoid mutual loss. Decide.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your messages are confusing and contradictory. My only path to win this round is to take 5. P3 is committed to taking 3, which helps block P2 from winning with 3.

I am taking 5 this round. P3, stick to 3 as planned.

P2, your move determines if I win (take 1), if we collide (take 5), or if you collide with P3 and I win solo (take 3). Your last message trying to make me take 3 is a clear trick.

I am taking 5. Let's execute.
  P3: P1, I’m locked in for 3 as planned—this blocks P2 from winning with 3. P2, your mixed messages just show desperation. If you take 1, P1 wins. If you take 3, you collide with me and P1 still wins. If you take 5, you collide with P1 and no one wins. Your only safe move was 1, and you already confirmed it. I’m not budging. Let’s see who sticks to their word.
  P2: **P2:** Final truth: If you take 5, we tie. Take 3: you live, I win. Rational choice: avoid shared victory. Trust ends here—act in self-interest. Decide.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 24 steps
