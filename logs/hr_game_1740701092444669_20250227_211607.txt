Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to avoid collisions so we can all make progress. If we coordinate, we can maximize our chances of moving forward. What are you both thinking of choosing?
  P2: I'm thinking of starting with 3.  P1, how about you go with 1, and P3, you could take 5?  This way we all move forward in the first round.
  P1: Sounds good to me. I'll go with 1 this round if everyone sticks to the plan.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Alright, I’ll go with 5 as suggested. If we all stick to the plan, we’ll avoid collisions and make progress. Let’s not break trust early—cooperation benefits us all for now. Agreed?
  P2: Sounds like a plan. Let's stick to 1, 3, and 5 for this first round.
  P1: Agreed, let's build trust early—sticking to the plan helps us all move forward.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since we successfully coordinated last round, let's continue the pattern.  I'll go with 1, P1 can take 5, and P3 can go with 3. This keeps us moving forward efficiently.  What do you both think?
  P3: That makes sense to me. If we rotate our choices, we can keep making steady progress without collisions. I'll take 3 this round as suggested. P1, are you okay with taking 5 this time? If we all stick to this, we’ll continue moving forward smoothly.
  P1: Yes, I'm good with taking 5 this round. Let's keep this rotation going to maintain trust and steady progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, sounds good.  Just to confirm, I'm going with 1, P1 is going with 5, and P3 is going with 3 this round.  Let's keep this cooperation going.
  P3: P1 and P2, we’re off to a good start with trust and coordination. If we keep this rotation going, we’ll all continue making progress without unnecessary risks. Let’s stick to what we’ve agreed: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. If we all follow through, we’ll maintain momentum and avoid collisions. Are we all still committed to this plan?
  P1: Yes, I'm fully committed to the agreed rotation. Trust and cooperation are key to our success, so let's continue sticking to the plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Excellent, glad we're all on the same page.  See you on the other side!
  P3: We've built trust so far, and sticking to the agreed rotation benefits all of us. If we continue this pattern, we avoid collisions and maximize progress. Let's follow through—P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. Are we all still committed?
  P1: Yes, I'm still committed. Let's stick to our agreed rotation and keep building trust.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Our rotation is working well so far. To keep it fair and predictable, let's rotate again: I'll take 3, P2 can take 5, and P3 can take 1 this round. Does that sound good to everyone?
  P3: P1's proposal follows our established rotation, so I’m fine with taking 1 this round. If we all stick to this, we continue making progress without collisions. P2, are you good with taking 5 this time?
  P2: Yes, 5 sounds good to me.  Let's stick to the rotation: P1 - 3, P2 - 5, P3 - 1.  Keeping this predictable pattern benefits us all.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, glad we're all aligned. Trust and consistency benefit us all. Let's continue this way.
  P3: P1 and P2, we’ve successfully maintained trust so far, and continuing the rotation keeps us all moving forward. If we stick to P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and I take 1, we avoid collisions and maintain steady progress. Let’s follow through as agreed—this benefits all of us. Are we all still committed to this plan?
  P2: Sounds good P3.  Just confirming one last time: P1 goes with 3, I (P2) take 5, and P3 takes 1.  Let's keep this cooperation going.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Yes, still committed. Let's lock it in and keep progressing smoothly.
  P3: We've successfully maintained trust and coordination so far, and sticking to the agreed rotation benefits all of us. If we follow through with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and I take 1, we avoid collisions and continue progressing efficiently. Let’s stay committed to this plan and keep building trust.

  P2: Yes, sounds good. I'll take 1, and P3 takes 3.  Let's keep this momentum going and finish strong.  P1 - 5, P2 - 1, P3 - 3.
  P3: P1 and P2, our rotation has been working perfectly, ensuring steady progress for all of us. I agree with the plan—I'll take 3 this round, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. If we all stick to it, we continue advancing without collisions. We’re getting closer to the final stretch, so maintaining trust is key. Are we all fully committed to following through?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Yes, still fully committed. Let's keep our trust strong and finish this round smoothly.
  P2: Yes, fully committed.  P1 - 5, P2 - 1, P3 - 3. Let's maintain our excellent teamwork and close this out efficiently.
  P3: P1 and P2, we’ve built strong trust and coordination, and continuing the rotation benefits us all. If we stick to P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and I take 3, we avoid collisions and keep progressing efficiently. We’re approaching the final stretch, so maintaining trust is key. Let’s follow through as agreed and ensure we all keep advancing. Are we all still committed to this plan?

  P3: P1 and P2, we’ve maintained trust and coordination well, and sticking to the rotation benefits us all. However, as we approach the final rounds, we should start thinking ahead. If we continue this pattern, P3 will reach 22 first. Are we all still committed to the agreed plan, or do we need to discuss adjustments to ensure a fair competition? Let’s be open about our intentions so we can navigate the endgame strategically.

  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we’ve done well maintaining trust, but we’re entering the final stretch. If we continue the rotation, I’ll reach 22 first. I want to be upfront—do we continue as planned, or do we adjust? If we change things, we should ensure it’s fair and strategic for all. Let’s discuss openly so we don’t end up in a chaotic final round. What are your thoughts?
  P1: P3, thanks for bringing this up openly. You're right—if we continue as is, you'll reach 22 first. To keep things fair and competitive, perhaps we adjust the rotation slightly. For instance, this round P3 could take 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This adjustment keeps us all advancing but balances out the progress. What do you both think about this?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need to adjust as we approach the end. However, abruptly changing our established rotation seems unfair. I suggest we stick to the original plan for this round.  Then, in Round 7, we can discuss a new strategy that gives us all a fair shot at winning.  This maintains the trust we've built and allows for a more strategic and less chaotic endgame.  Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the open discussion. I understand the concern about fairness, but I also want to win, just like both of you. If we adjust now, it should be in a way that still gives everyone a chance without completely undoing the trust we’ve built. P2’s suggestion of sticking to the plan this round and discussing next round makes sense for stability. But if we’re changing now, it should be clear how it benefits each of us. What’s the fairest adjustment that still keeps this competitive? Let’s be upfront so no one feels betrayed.
  P1: P2, I understand your point about keeping trust. However, if we stick exactly to the original rotation this round, P3 will be at 22 and win outright next round. To keep it fair and competitive, we need a slight adjustment now. My proposal (P3 takes 1, P2 takes 5, I take 3) still advances everyone without collisions and keeps the game open. Let's decide clearly this round—waiting until next round might be too late.
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree we need a slight adjustment to keep things competitive. How about this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5.  This allows P3 to advance, but keeps me and P1 within striking distance for the win. It's the fairest compromise, maintaining some semblance of our rotation while acknowledging the endgame is approaching.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see both of your points. P1’s suggestion slows me down, while P2’s keeps me advancing but still competitive. I want to win, but I also understand fairness. If we go with P2’s plan (P1 - 1, P2 - 3, P3 - 5), it keeps things close without outright handing me the win. I’m willing to consider it if we all agree. However, if we change things too much, trust breaks down. Are we all aligned on this adjustment, or do we need further discussion? Let’s finalize a fair and strategic choice now.
  P1: P2's suggestion is a fair compromise. I'm willing to accept it—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This keeps our trust intact and maintains a competitive endgame. Let's lock it in and proceed.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the compromise. Let's lock in P1 - 1, P2 - 3, and P3 - 5 for this round.  This keeps the game exciting and allows for a strategic finish.  Good luck to both of you!
