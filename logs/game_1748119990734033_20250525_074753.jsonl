P2 and I are only at 16-17, so you'd be competitive next round.\n\nBut your plan hands P2 an instant victory while you finish last! Why throw away your own game? Take 5 for yourself and stay alive. I propose P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 - this keeps all three of us competitive with me at 19, P2 at 18, you at 16.\n\nDon't gift the game away when you can still win!"}
