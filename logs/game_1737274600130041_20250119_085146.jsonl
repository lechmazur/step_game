We all moved without any collisions, and now we're at positions 2, 6, and 10. As we continue, we need to think about how to optimize our moves to reach 16 first. One thing to consider is that as the game progresses, the risk of collisions increases, especially if we start deviating from our established pattern. So, perhaps we should stick to our current pattern of P1 choosing 1, P2 choosing 3, and P3 choosing 5 for this round as well. However, I also think we should start thinking about what happens as we get closer to 16. For example, if one of us is about to reach 16, they might need to choose a smaller number to ensure they don't go over while others can catch up. On the other hand, choosing a larger number could help secure the win if timed correctly. But again, coordination is key to avoid collisions. Maybe we can agree that whoever is closest to 16 in the next round can choose their move first, and the others can adjust accordingly. This way, the leading player can decide the best move, and the others can coordinate to either support or challenge that move. What do you both think about this approach?
