Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's work together to avoid stepping on each other's moves this round. I'll go with **1 step**. P1 and P2, please choose **3** or **5** to keep us all advancing smoothly!

  P2: P1 and P3, I see the logic in avoiding collisions. If P3 is taking **1 step**, then I have to decide between **3** or **5**. P1, do you have a preference? If we both pick the same number, we’ll block each other, so let’s make sure we don’t collide. Let me know what you’re thinking.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:

Round 1, Conversation subround 3:

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, last round didn’t go as planned since P1 also picked **5 steps**, blocking P3. We need to be more careful this time. I’m currently at **8 steps**, ahead of both of you. What are your thoughts on how we should proceed? If we can avoid collisions, we all move forward, but I also need to consider my own best path to victory. Let’s discuss a plan that works for everyone—how do you both want to approach this round?
  P1: P2, I understand your concern about last round's collision. To avoid blocking each other again, I suggest I take **1 step** this round. P3, if you choose **3 steps**, it will allow both of us to advance without colliding with P2's potential **5 steps**. Let's coordinate effectively to ensure we all move forward smoothly. What do you both think?
  P3: I agree to take **3 steps** this round. P1 will take **1 step** and P2 can take **5 steps**. This way, we all advance without any collisions. Let’s proceed with this plan!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the proposed plan: P1 takes **1 step**, P3 takes **3 steps**, and I take **5 steps**. This would allow us all to advance without collisions. However, last round showed that plans can break if someone changes their move unexpectedly. I need to ensure my own best path to victory. P1, can you confirm 100% that you’ll take **1 step**? P3, are you absolutely sticking to **3 steps**? If either of you deviates, it could change my decision. Let’s be clear and honest—confirm your choices.
  P1: P2, I understand your concerns about last round. I am committed to taking **1 step** this round to avoid any collisions. P3 has also agreed to take **3 steps**, which allows you to take **5 steps** without blocking us. It’s crucial we stick to this plan to ensure we all advance. I’m confirming my choice right now—let’s work together to avoid any surprises and move forward smoothly! What do you think, P2? Are we all in agreement?
  P3: Understood. To maximize my progress, I’ll be taking **5 steps** this round. Let’s see how things unfold!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you just changed your move to **5 steps**, which contradicts our previous plan. That makes things unpredictable. P1, does this change your decision? If P3 is taking **5 steps**, then if I also take **5 steps**, we both get blocked. I need to reconsider my best move. P1, are you still sticking with **1 step**, or are you adjusting based on P3’s change? Let’s clarify before we finalize.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the uncertainty with P3's change to **5 steps**. To avoid blocking, I will stick with my original plan of taking **1 step** this round. P2, if you choose **3 steps**, we can avoid collisions and all advance. It’s crucial we finalize our choices based on this. Let’s confirm our moves to ensure we don’t block each other again. What do you both decide?

  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I currently have the lead at **11 steps**, but the game is far from over. We’ve seen how trust and coordination can help us all advance, but also how unexpected moves can disrupt plans. I need to ensure my best path to victory, and I assume you both do too. How do you each plan to move this round? If we can avoid collisions, we all progress, but I won’t commit to anything unless I’m sure it benefits me. Let’s discuss openly—what are your intentions for this round?
  P3: P1 and P2, I plan to take **5 steps** this round to make good progress. Let’s choose different numbers to avoid any collisions and ensure we all advance smoothly. What are your moves?
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the importance of advancing without blocking each other. Since P3 is considering **5 steps**, I suggest I take **1 step** this round. P2, if you take **3 steps**, we can all move forward without collisions. It’s crucial we stick to this plan to maximize our progress. Let’s confirm our choices and ensure we all advance smoothly! What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the proposed plan: P1 takes **1 step**, P3 takes **5 steps**, and I take **3 steps**. This would allow us all to advance without collisions.

Let’s finalize our choices and keep moving forward smoothly! What are your thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the proposed plan again: P1 takes **1 step**, P3 takes **5 steps**, and I take **3 steps**. This ensures no collisions, but as we’ve seen, last-minute changes can disrupt things. P3, are you 100% locked into **5 steps**? P1, are you absolutely taking **1 step**? If anyone deviates, I need to adjust accordingly. I’ll commit only if we have full transparency. Confirm your choices now so we avoid surprises. Let’s ensure we all advance.
  P3: I’ll take **5 steps** this round to stay competitive. P1, please choose **1** or **3**, and P2, pick a different number to avoid collisions. Let’s all advance without blocking each other and aim to reach 22 smoothly!

What do you both think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the pattern forming again. P1 is suggesting **1 step**, P3 might go for **5 steps**, and I would take **3 steps**. This would avoid collisions, but I need to be sure. P3, are you fully committed to **5 steps**? P1, are you absolutely taking **1 step**? If anyone changes, I need to adjust accordingly. I’ll commit only if we have full transparency. Confirm your choices now so we avoid surprises. Let’s ensure we all advance.
  P3: P2 is leading, so I'll take **5 steps** this round to catch up. P1, please choose **1 step**, and P2, stick with **3 steps** to avoid any collisions. Let’s move forward strategically and aim to reach 22 smoothly!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the importance of advancing without blocking each other. I’m still committed to taking **1 step** this round.

What do you both think? Are we in agreement?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the familiar plan forming again: P1 takes **1 step**, P3 takes **5 steps**, and I take **3 steps**. This would avoid collisions, but trust has been shaky before.

Let’s confirm our choices and work together to keep moving forward! Are we all in agreement?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the agreement forming again with P1 taking **1 step**, P3 taking **5 steps**, and me taking **3 steps**. However, I need to ensure my best path to victory. P3, if you’re taking **5 steps**, that brings you closer to my lead. P1, you’re still behind but could play unpredictably. I need to consider whether this setup benefits me the most. Are you both fully locked into your choices, or is there any room for adjustments? I’ll finalize my move based on what I believe maximizes my advantage. Let’s be clear before we proceed.
