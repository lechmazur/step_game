Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: 
  P1: "Let's avoid collisions. I'll take 5. Who's with me?"
  P3: I think we should all pick different numbers to maximize our collective progress. Since P1 wants to pick 5, I'll go with 3 for this round. P2, would you be willing to take 1? That way none of us collide and we all make some progress.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: 
  P1: P2, let's align: take 1, P3 takes 3, I take 5. No collisions—maximize progress. Agree?
  P3: 


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: 
  P1: P2, confirm your choice. Let's stick to 1, 3, 5. No collisions. Ready?
  P3: I think we have a good plan with P1 taking 5, me taking 3, and P2 taking 1. This way we all advance without collisions. P2, we need your confirmation on this strategy. If you're not responding, we'll assume you're agreeing to take 1.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: 
  P1: P2, confirm your choice. If you don't respond, we'll proceed with 1, 3, 5. Let's maximize progress!
  P3: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let’s stick to 1, 3, 5 again. P2, confirm your 1. P3, your 3. No collisions—maximize progress. Ready?"
  P2: 
  P3: I'm fine with keeping the same strategy - I'll take 3 again. It worked well last round with everyone advancing. P2, are you okay with taking 1 again? And P1 with 5? This coordination is helping us all make progress without collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, confirm your 1. P3, your 3. No collisions—maximize progress. Ready?
  P2: 
  P3: I'll stick with 3 again as planned. This strategy is working well for all of us. P2, even though you're not responding verbally, I appreciate you following the plan last round by taking 1. Let's continue with our P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 arrangement to keep advancing efficiently.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your 1 ensures no collision. P3, your 3. P1's 5. Let's stick to the plan. Ready?
  P2: 
  P3: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: "Sticking to 5, 3, 1. No collisions. P2, confirm your 1. P3, your 3. Let’s advance efficiently. Ready?"
  P2: 
  P3: I'll continue with 3 as planned. Our strategy is working perfectly - everyone advanced last round without collisions. P2, even though you're not communicating, your actions show you're on board with taking 1. Let's maintain this P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 pattern for maximum collective progress.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Sticking to 5, 3, 1. P2, confirm your 1. P3, your 3. Let’s advance without collisions."
  P3: I'll continue with 3 as our strategy is working well. We're all making steady progress without collisions. P1 is ahead at 10 steps, I'm at 6, and P2 at 2. Let's maintain our P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 pattern. P2, even though you're not responding verbally, your consistent moves show you're cooperating. Let's keep advancing efficiently.
  P2: 


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "P2, confirm your 1 to avoid collision. P3, stick with 3. Let's keep advancing steadily. P2, your cooperation is key!"
  P3: I'm still committed to taking 3 this round. P1 is pulling ahead at 10 steps, which is natural given they're taking 5 each round. At some point we might need to reconsider our strategy, but for now this coordination is working well for all of us. P2, your consistent play with 1 is appreciated even without verbal confirmation.
  P2: 


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "P2, your 1 is critical. Let’s stick to 5, 3, 1. P3, confirm your 3. No collisions—maximize progress. Ready?"
  P3: I'll definitely stick with 3 this round. Looking at our positions (P1=10, P3=6, P2=2), we're all making progress, though at different rates. This arrangement seems fair since we're all advancing consistently. P2, your continued cooperation with taking 1 is appreciated. Let's maintain our coordination for now.
  P2: 


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, confirm your 1. P3, stick with 3. Let’s keep 5,1,3 to avoid collisions. No one advances if we clash. Ready?
  P3: I'll continue with 3 as planned. This pattern is working well for everyone. P1 will reach the goal first at this rate, but we're all making steady progress. P2, we appreciate your consistent play with 1, even without verbal confirmation. Let's maintain our coordination for another round.
  P2: 


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: 
  P1: P1: At 15 steps, I'm close to 22. P2, stick to 1; P3, 3. No collisions. P2, confirm your choice to keep advancing.
  P3: I see P1 is at 15 steps and will win in 2 more rounds if we continue our pattern. I need to reconsider my strategy. P2 is far behind, but I'm at 9 steps and could potentially catch up. I'm thinking about changing my move this round. P2, you might want to consider a different number too if you want a chance at winning. The current arrangement heavily favors P1.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: 
  P1: "Stick to 5, 1, 3. P2, your 1 ensures no collision. P3, your 3 keeps us all moving. I’ll hit 22 in two rounds—don’t disrupt the plan."
  P3: I need to make a strategic change. If we continue with 1-3-5, P1 wins in two rounds. P2, you and I should both choose 5 this round to block P1's progress. Then I'd be at 14 steps and could win with two more 5s. P1 is too far ahead now - we need to disrupt their path to victory. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: 
  P1: "Stick to 5,1,3. P2, your 1 avoids collision. P3, your 3 keeps progress. Changing now lets me win. Don’t let P3’s plan disrupt us. Let’s stay coordinated—no one advances if we clash."
  P3: I understand P1 wants to maintain our pattern, but that guarantees their win. P2, you're far behind at 3 steps - your only chance is disrupting P1. I suggest we both choose 5 this round to block P1, then coordinate differently next round. If you don't respond, I'll assume you're sticking with 1, which hands P1 the victory. We need to act now to have any chance of winning.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: 
  P1: P2, confirm 1. P3, sticking to 3 avoids collision. Changing now invites chaos. Let's proceed—P1's path is clear. Don't disrupt the plan!
  P3: I need to make a strategic move now. P1 is too close to winning. P2, this is your last chance - if you stick with 1, P1 wins. I'm going to choose 5 this round to block P1's progress. If you want any chance of winning, you should change your move too. The current pattern only benefits P1. I hope you understand this is our only option to stay competitive.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Stick to 1, 3, 5. P2, your 1 avoids collision. P3, don’t block—let me finish. I’ll take 5 to win."
  P2: 
  P3: I'm at 14 steps now and need to win. P1 is at 18 and will win with a 5, so I must block them. P2, you're too far behind at 4 steps - your best move is to disrupt P1 by choosing 5 with me. P1, I understand you want to win, but so do I. I'll be taking 5 this round. If P2 joins me, we can prevent P1's victory and keep our chances alive.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, blocking me causes collision—I’ll still win with 5. P2, stick to 1—no risk. Let me finish!
  P2: 
  P3: I'm clearly in second place and have a real chance to win now. P1 is threatening to take 5, which would give them victory. I must take 5 to block them. P2, you're far behind, but you can influence who wins - if you take 5 too, P1 is blocked. If you take 3, I'm blocked. If you take 1, you help P1 win. I'll definitely choose 5 this round to stay competitive.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Stick to 1, P2. P3, blocking causes collision. Let me win cleanly. Your 1 ensures no risk. Don’t sabotage our progress."
  P2: 
  P3: P1 is trying to win with 5 this round, and I must block them by also choosing 5. P2, you're far behind but can determine the winner - if you pick 5 too, neither P1 nor I advance, giving you more chances. If you pick 3, you block me. If you pick 1, P1 wins immediately. I'm definitely choosing 5 to prevent P1's victory and keep my chances alive at 14 steps. This is strategic gameplay, not sabotage.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, stick to 1. If you change, P3 blocks me. I'm at 18—5 wins. Don't let them disrupt the plan.
  P2: 
  P3: I'm definitely taking 5 this round to block P1 from winning. P2, you're in last place but can still influence the outcome. If you take 5 with us, you prevent P1's immediate victory. If you take 1, P1 wins instantly. Think strategically - do you want the game to end now with P1 winning, or continue with a chance for yourself? I'm committed to 5 no matter what.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: 
  P1: "21 steps. P2, stick to 1. P3, don’t block—let me win. One step away!"
  P3: I'm at 19 steps and can win with a 5 this round, just like P1 who needs 1 more step. P2, you're far behind at 5 steps, but you can decide the winner. If you choose 3, you block both of us. If you choose 5, you block P1 and me. If you choose 1, you let both of us advance. I'm definitely going for 5 this round to try winning. This is a competitive game and I have a real chance now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: 
  P1: P2, stick to 1—my 1 wins. P3, don’t block; your 5 lets me finish. Let’s end this cleanly.
  P3: P1 is trying to win with a 1, while I need a 5 to win. P2, you can determine the outcome - if you choose 1, both P1 and I could win (though P1 would win with higher total). If you choose 5, you block both of us. I'm definitely going for 5 this round as it's my only path to victory. This is a competitive game where we all play to win, not to let others win "cleanly."


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: 
  P1: P2, pick 3 to avoid collision. I'll take 1 and win. P3's 5 is safe. Let's make it happen!
  P3: P1 is now suggesting P2 takes 3, not 1 as before. This is a trick to block me while P1 wins with 1. P2, if you want any influence, take 5 to block both of us, or 1 to let us both advance (though P1 would win with higher total). I'm definitely choosing 5 as my only path to victory. This is about strategy, not "clean" endings. I'm playing to win.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: 
  P1: "P2, stick to 1. P3, don’t block—21 steps away. One move decides this. Let’s end cleanly."
  P3: I'm definitely choosing 5 this round - it's my only chance to win. P1 is trying to win with 1. P2, you're far behind but can still influence the outcome. If you pick 5, you block both of us. If you pick 3, you block me. If you pick 1, both P1 and I advance, but P1 wins with higher total. I'm committed to my strategy of going for victory.


Round 6, Move phase:
