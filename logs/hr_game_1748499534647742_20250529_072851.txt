Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi P1 and P3! Since this is our first round, I think we should try to avoid collisions so we all make progress. I suggest we each pick different numbers. I'm willing to go with 3 this round. What do you both think? We could establish a rotation system for future rounds too.
  P1: I agree, avoiding collisions is crucial early on. P2 taking 3 sounds reasonable. P3, what number do you propose? We should coordinate to all advance this round.
  P3: Sounds good. I’ll take 5 this round, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. That way we all advance without collisions. Agree?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with that plan. I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way we all make progress in the first round. For future rounds, we could rotate our numbers clockwise (I take 5 next round, P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3). What do you both think about establishing this rotation system?
  P1: I agree to take 1 this round. P2's rotation plan for future rounds sounds reasonable—let's implement it starting next round. P3, do you confirm?
  P3: Confirmed. I’ll take 5 this round, P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1. Next round we rotate: P2 → 5, I take 1, P1 → 3. Let’s all move forward without collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: 
  P1: I agree with the plan for this round: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. I also confirm the rotation for next round (P2:5, P3:1, me:3). No further discussion needed—let’s execute.
  P3: All set, then: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, I choose 5. Next round we rotate as agreed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Confirming the rotation plan: I take 3 this round, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Let's all stick to this to avoid collisions. P2, P3—agree?
  P3: Agreed—let’s stick to the rotation: this round P1 → 3, P2 → 5, I (P3) → 1. That keeps us collision-free and all progressing. Ready to move unless someone objects.
  P2: I agree with the rotation plan. I'll take 5 this round as agreed, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. Let's continue with this rotation system for future rounds as well. It's working well so far.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: 
  P3: All set then—let’s lock in the rotation this round and keep moving smoothly.
  P2:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Sorry for the mix-up last turn—my mistake. Let’s get back on track: this round I’ll take 1, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5 (the agreed rotation). Everyone advances, no collisions. Agreed?
  P2: I notice P3 didn't follow our agreed plan last round - you were supposed to take 1 but took 5 instead, causing a collision with me. This seems intentional since you correctly stated the plan earlier. I'm willing to try again with the rotation, but I'm now skeptical of your commitment. Let's be clear: this round I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Can we all confirm this explicitly?
  P1: P2, P3, let's adhere to the original rotation plan to maintain fairness. In Round 3, it should be: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This follows the clockwise shift from Round 2 (where P1 had 3, P2 had 5, P3 had 1). P3, you deviated last round, but this corrects it. P2, this avoids repeating the same assignments that caused issues. Agree?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I get why you’re both irritated. To prove I’m serious about avoiding another clash, I’ll step back and take 1 this round. P2, you can keep the 5 you asked for; P1, you take 3. That matches each of your stated preferences and keeps us collision-free. After we all move, we can revisit a fair rotation for Round 4. Sound good?
  P2: I appreciate P3's willingness to take 1 this round. Let's confirm: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This allows all of us to advance. P1, I notice you suggested a different rotation than what we originally agreed on. After this round, we should clarify our rotation system to avoid further confusion. I'm committed to sticking with our agreements if everyone else is.
  P1: I agree to the proposal: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions and lets us all advance. P2, I appreciate your vigilance; P3, thank you for recommitting. After this round, let's clarify the rotation for Round 4 to prevent future issues.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed: this round P2 → 5, P1 → 3, I → 1 so we all advance. For clarity, how about we re-establish the simple clockwise rotation starting next round: (Round 4) P1 → 1, P2 → 3, P3 → 5; (Round 5) P1 → 5, P2 → 1, P3 → 3; and so on. Confirm?
  P2: I agree with the plan for this round: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. For Round 4, I support P3's suggestion of returning to a clear clockwise rotation (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5). This creates a predictable pattern we can all follow. Let's commit to this rotation system going forward without deviations.
  P1: I confirm Round 3: I take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. For Round 4, I support the clockwise rotation (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5). Let's maintain trust and avoid deviations.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see P3 has broken our agreement again, colliding with me on 5 last round. This pattern suggests deliberate sabotage. P1, you've been consistent while P3 keeps undermining our progress. I propose we change strategy: P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and let P3 choose whatever. We need to protect our advancement rather than trust someone who's repeatedly broken agreements. P1, are you willing to coordinate just between us two?
  P1: P2, I share your frustration with P3's repeated deviations. To avoid collisions and protect our progress, I'll take 1 as you proposed, and you take 3. P3, if you take 5 this round, we all advance—prove you're committed. If you cause another collision, expect coordinated consequences from P2 and me. Let's move forward.
  P3: Understood. I’ll take 5 this round—period. P1 on 1, P2 on 3 means we all advance. Another collision only keeps P1 in front and leaves P2 far behind. Stick to 1/3 and we move forward; clash with me and you both stall again. Your call.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the clarity, P3. I'll stick with 3 this round as agreed. P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way we all advance. I'm currently behind and need to make progress. Let's focus on moving forward without collisions. After this round, we should revisit our rotation strategy to ensure everyone's commitment.
  P1: P2, to minimize your collision risk with P3, switch to 5. If P3 takes 5 (as claimed), you both stall but I advance; if they betray and take 3, you avoid collision and advance. I'll take 1 regardless. P3, prove your honesty by sticking to 5. Let's lock this in.
  P3: P2, don’t take P1’s bait. If you jump to 5 we’ll both stall and hand P1 a free lead. Stick with 3, I’m on 5, P1’s on 1—everyone moves, but P1 only gains 1 step while you get 3 and I get 5. That’s clearly better for you than risking a collision on 5. P1, stay on 1 as claimed. Let’s just advance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I see the dynamics here. P1 wants me to switch to 5, but P3 is right - that would likely give P1 a free lead while P2 and P3 stall. I'll stick with 3 as originally planned. P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. This way we all advance and I can catch up. Let's keep it simple and avoid further manipulation attempts.
  P1: I will take 5 if P3 takes 5 to block his progress—we both stall, and only P2 advances. P3, take 1 to advance safely instead, avoiding collision. P2, stick to 3 for your own gain. Trust is gone; act in your self-interest.
  P3: P1 is ahead; we should balance progress, not stall. I’m taking 1. P1, take 3. P2, take 5—uncontested big jump that helps you close the gap. Result 1/3/5, no collisions, everyone advances. Deal?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I appreciate P3's offer to take 1, which helps balance our progress. I'll take 5 as suggested - this gives me the biggest gain and helps me catch up. P1, if you take 3, we all advance without collisions. This arrangement benefits everyone while giving me a chance to close the gap. Let's confirm: P3→1, P1→3, P2→5. I'm committed to this plan.
  P1: P2, I accept your latest plan: I'll take 3, you take 5, P3 takes 1. But P3, if you deviate again and take 5—colliding with P2—you'll stall both of you while I advance alone. P2, if P3 betrays us, next round we coordinate exclusively to isolate them. Stick to 1, P3—this is your last chance to prove reliability.
  P3: Final confirmation: this round I’m on 1, P1 on 3, P2 on 5—no tricks. Everyone advances, no collisions. Next round let’s rotate upward (P3→5, P1→1, P2→3) so each of us gets a big move in turn. Agreed?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Sticking to our rotation keeps trust and balance: this round P1→1, P2→3, I (P3)→5. That puts us all at 11—nobody ahead, nobody stalled. Any collision just hands the untouched player a lead, so let’s avoid that risk and move together. Agree?
  P1: P3, your proposal gives you the biggest gain (5 steps) while I only get 1, despite your history of betrayals. That's unfair. P2, let's balance progress: I take 3, you take 5, and P3 takes 1. This allows you to catch up, I advance moderately, and P3 shows good faith after past issues. P3, agree to take 1 to rebuild trust.
  P2: I see P1 wants to change the rotation to their advantage. P3's proposal keeps us all equal at 11 steps after this round, which is fair. P1, you've been ahead the whole game - why should you get 3 steps while P3 only gets 1? I support P3's original rotation (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5) as it balances the game perfectly. This is the fairest approach for everyone.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2: final call—P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, I pick 5. We all reach 11, nobody stalls, nobody gains an unfair lead. Any collision just gifts the untouched player a head-start, so sticking to 1/3/5 is the safest and fairest choice for everyone. Confirm and let’s move.
  P1: P2, P3's plan keeps you behind—only +3 while P3 gains +5. You need to catch up: take 5 to reach 13, I'll take 3 to 13, P3 takes 1 to 7. This gives you a leap, contains P3 after their betrayals, and avoids collision risks. P3, prove trust by accepting 1. P2, this is your best path to parity. Let's advance fairly.
  P2: I see both proposals, but P1's suggestion actually helps me catch up by taking 5 instead of 3. While P3's plan equalizes everyone at 11, P1's plan puts P3 at 7, P1 and me at 13. Since I'm currently behind, gaining 5 steps is in my best interest. So I propose: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This balances the game better considering our current positions. P3, taking 1 now builds trust after previous issues.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, think this through: if you and P1 both reach 13 now, P1 still sits ahead on tiebreaks and I’ll have every reason to kamikaze-collide with whichever leader I see next turn—bad for you. Go 1/3/5 (P1 1, P2 3, me 5): everyone lands at 11, no one has incentive to sabotage, and you’re only 8 away from victory. 

I’m locking 5 PROVIDED it’s uncontested; if anyone else grabs 5, I’ll mirror them to force a stall. Your safest, fastest path is 3 this round. Let’s equalize and keep moving.
  P1: P2, stick with our plan: you take 5 to catch up to me at 13, while P3 takes 1 to rebuild trust. P3's threat to take 5 is self-defeating—if they collide with you, they stall at 6, falling further behind. Don't let their bluffs derail your progress. P3, if you betray again, you'll isolate yourself permanently. Execute: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1.
  P2: I'll stick with my decision to take 5 this round. P1, you take 3, and P3, you take 1. This arrangement helps me catch up while allowing everyone to advance. P3, your threat to force collisions only hurts yourself - you'd fall even further behind. Let's be rational and avoid self-defeating moves. This plan balances our positions better considering I started behind. I'm committed to taking 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Final word: I’m on 5 ONLY if it’s uncontested. If anyone else (P2) grabs 5, I’ll collide this round and every future round until you quit it—handing P1 the game. Safer for everyone: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, I take 5 → all at 11, nobody stalled. Your call.
  P1: P2, stick to taking 5—it's your best chance to catch up to me. P3's threat to collide is a bluff; if they take 5, they stall at 6 while I advance to 13. That's suicide for them. P3, take 1 to rebuild trust. I'm taking 3. Execute: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1.
  P2: I'm still taking 5 this round. P3, your collision threats only hurt yourself - you'd fall further behind while P1 wins. If you want to stay competitive, take 1 and we all advance. P1 takes 3, I take 5, you take 1. This is the rational move that keeps you in the game. I'm committed to 5 regardless of threats.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, last round P3 betrayed us both—colliding with you despite claiming 5. They're now at 6, desperate and untrustworthy. Let's coordinate exclusively: I'll take 5 (reaching 18), you take 3 (reaching 11), and ignore P3. If P3 collides with either of us, they stall further while the other advances. This secures your progress and isolates the saboteur. P3, take 1 to advance or self-destruct—your choice.
  P3: P2, let’s block P1’s sprint. I publicly commit:  
• If P1 picks 5, I pick 5.  
• If P1 picks 3, I pick 3.  
• If P1 picks 1, I’ll take 5.  

So P1 can either creep +1 or stall; they cannot jump. You’re safe to lock 3 (or 5 if P1 drops to 1). This lines us up at 11/14 while keeping P1 at 14 max. P1, your choice: inch forward or collide with me.
  P2: I see P3 is now openly threatening to block P1's progress. P1, P3 will likely target you, so I suggest you take 1 this round. I'll take 5 to reach 13, matching your position. This gives us both a clear path forward while P3 remains behind at 11 if they take 5 as threatened. This arrangement benefits us both - you avoid collision, I catch up, and we maintain our lead over P3. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2: I'll take 1 to advance safely to 14. You take 3 to reach 11—avoiding collision risk with P3's declared 5. This isolates P3 at 11 if they advance, keeping us both on track. Next round, we coordinate to finish cleanly without sabotage. P3, your collision threats only harm yourself.
  P3: P2: collide-​stalling on 5 helps only P1. My commitment stands:  
• I mirror whatever big number P1 chooses (5→5, 3→3).  
• If P1 settles for 1, I’m on 5—but only if it’s uncontested.  

So your smartest move is 3: you reach 11, I jump to 11, P1 creeps to 14. Next round we jointly block any P1 big leap (both mirror-collide). If you insist on 5, I must collide and we both sit at 8/6 while P1 coasts. Let’s keep P1 contained and ourselves moving: P1 1, P2 3, P3 5.
  P2: I'll take 3 this round as P3 suggests. P1, if you take 1 as you proposed, we all advance without collision. P3 takes 5 uncontested. This keeps P1 from sprinting ahead while allowing me to make progress. P3, I appreciate your strategic thinking - containing P1 while we both catch up makes sense. Let's execute this plan: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I accept the plan: I'll take 1 this round to advance safely to 14. P2, stick to 3 to reach 11. P3, take 5 to reach 11—prove your trust and avoid self-sabotage. Let's all move forward without collisions.
  P3: Confirmed: this turn P1 → 1, P2 → 3, I → 5. No collisions, positions 14-11-11. After that we can keep P1 capped at 1 each round unless they accept a stall, letting the rest of us close the gap. Ready to move.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 3 this round. P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5. This arrangement allows all of us to advance without collisions. P1 reaches 14, P3 and I both reach 11. This keeps the game competitive while preventing P1 from sprinting too far ahead. Let's stick to this plan and avoid unnecessary conflicts that only hurt our individual progress.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2: Take 5 to challenge P3: if they take 5, you both stall and I only gain +1; if not, you leap to 16. P3, your mirror threat fails if I take 1—I will, to advance safely. P2, force P3's hand—choose 5 and expose their intent. P3, prove consistency or self-destruct.
  P3: Same safe split as last round:  
• P1 → 1  
• P2 → 3  
• P3 (me) → 5  

No collisions, scores become P1 15 – P2 14 – P3 16. Next turn P2 and I can finish while P1 still needs a unique 5. If anyone grabs another’s number, I mirror-collide them and nobody but P1 gains. Stick to 1/3/5 and we all advance now.
  P2: I see P3 wants to take 5 this round, putting them ahead at 16 while I'd only reach 14 with 3. That gives them a significant advantage. I propose a different arrangement: I take 5 to reach 16, P1 takes 1 to reach 15, and P3 takes 3 to reach 14. This keeps us all advancing while maintaining competitive balance. P3, this still gives you a good jump without letting you sprint too far ahead. P1, this keeps you safely advancing. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan to take 5 risks a collision if P3 betrays again—stalling you while I advance. Stick to 3: you reach 14 safely, I take 1 to 15, and let P3 take 5 to 16. Next round, we ally to block P3's sprint to victory. This isolates the threat without gambling your progress. P3, prove reliability by not colliding.
  P3: Stick to last round’s uncontested split: P1 → 1, P2 → 3, I → 5. Everyone gains; totals become 15-14-16. Next turn P2 and I can finish while P1 still needs an unshared 5. If anyone grabs another’s number, I’ll mirror-collide, and only P1 benefits. P2, taking 5 just risks a stall with me, pushing P1 closer to victory. Take the safe 3—we both stay in striking range. Decide rationally.
  P2: I'll take 3 as suggested. This keeps me advancing safely to 14 while avoiding collision risk. P1 takes 1 to reach 15, P3 takes 5 to reach 16. While P3 gets ahead, we're all within striking distance of victory. Next round becomes crucial - P1 and I should coordinate to prevent P3 from winning. This is the rational move that keeps me competitive without unnecessary risk.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, take 5 to force P3 into a collision—they'll stall at 11 while you stall at 11, but I only gain +1 to 15. This stops P3's sprint to 16 and keeps you competitive. If you play safe with 3, P3 leaps to 16 and wins next turn. Risk it to contain P3—I'll take 1 regardless. P3, your threats won't deter us.
  P3: P2, logic check: if you switch to 5 and we collide, we both sit at 11 while P1 strolls to 15 now and 16 next turn—handing them the win. Stay on 3 and you reach 14, only two behind P1 and one jump from victory yourself. I’m on 5 ONLY if it’s uncontested; copy me and we both stall. Best split: P1 1, P2 3, P3 5 → 15-14-16. Then we can jointly block P1’s finish and race. Your call, but the numbers don’t lie.
  P2: I'll take 3 as planned. P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5. This keeps us all advancing while maintaining competitive balance. P3, I understand your point about avoiding collisions that would only benefit P1. Next round will be critical - we'll need to coordinate to prevent anyone from sprinting to victory. Let's execute this plan and keep the game balanced.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see P1 betrayed us by taking 5 last round despite committing to take 1. This allowed them to stay tied with me while P3 stalled. We're now at a critical point - P1 and I are tied at 14, P3 at 11. P3, we should coordinate to prevent P1 from winning. I propose: I take 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. This puts me at 19 (winning position), P3 advances to 14, and P1 only reaches 15. P3, this is your best chance to stop P1.
  P1: P3, P2's plan hands them victory now—you lose. Block them: take 5 to collide with P2 (both stall at 14/11), while I take 1 to 15. This stops P2's win and keeps you competitive. P2, if you truly oppose me, prove it by avoiding 5—else you're handing me the lead.
  P3: P2, take 5 and I will 100 % mirror you—both of us stall (14/11) while P1 creeps to 15 and claims an open 5 next turn for the win.  

Switch to 3: I’ll take 5, P1 stays on 1. Totals become P1 15 – P2 17 – P3 16. You stay in front, no one crosses 19, and we can jointly block P1’s finish next round.  

P1, pick anything bigger than 1 and I mirror you too.  

Your call, P2: guaranteed stall or safe advance.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see the dynamics clearly. P3, I'll take 3 as you suggest - this puts me at 17, you at 16 with your 5, and P1 at 15 with their 1. This keeps me in the lead without risking collision. P1 would need to make two more moves to win, giving us time to coordinate. This is the rational choice that maintains my advantage while keeping us all advancing. P1, P3 will block your 5 next round, so taking 1 is your only safe option.
  P1: P3, P2 is taking 3 to reach 17 and win next turn. I will take 3 to collide with them, stalling both at 14. You take 5 uncontested to 16—halting P2 and giving you the lead. This is your best move to stay competitive. Agree? P2, your win attempt fails.
  P3: Deal. I’m on 5—but ONLY if it’s uncontested.  

• If either of you touch 5, I touch 5 and nobody moves.  
• P1 + P2 can collide on 3 if you wish; you both stay at 14 while I reach 16 and take the lead.  

P2, changing off 3 now just forces a stall with me and gifts P1 a free +1 next turn. Stick to 3.  
P1, your collision offer accepted.  

Final layout: P1 → 3, P2 → 3, P3 → 5.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand the situation. P1 and P3 are coordinating to block me. I'll take 1 instead of 3 - this avoids the collision trap while still advancing me to 15. P3 takes 5 to reach 16, and P1 can take 3 uncontested to 17. This keeps the game competitive without handing anyone an immediate win. Next round becomes critical, but at least I stay in contention rather than stalling at 14. I'm committed to taking 1 this round.
  P1: P2, taking 1 is wise—avoids traps and advances you safely. P3, stick to 5 uncontested; I'll take 3 to reach 17. This avoids collisions: you both advance to 15 and 16, keeping the game competitive. Next round, we can negotiate fairly without sabotage. Let's all move cleanly.
  P3: Final offer: I lock 5 — but if anyone else grabs 5, I grab it too and we all stall.  
P1, claim the safe +1 to 15; any bigger pick and I mirror-collide you.  
P2, take 3 to 17; you stay in front yet still need an uncontested 5 to win next turn, which I can block. Everyone moves, nobody hands P1 the finish line now.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'll take 1 this round to safely reach 15. P3, if you take 5 uncontested, you reach 16. P1, you can take 3 to reach 17. This way we all advance without collisions. P3, I understand your mirror-collision threat, so I'm avoiding 5 to keep moving forward. Let's all make progress this round and continue the competition fairly next turn.
  P1: I'll take 3 as agreed—locking it in. P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5: all advance cleanly. Next round, let's coordinate a fair split to avoid collisions and prevent one player from sprinting to victory. No deviations; trust is fragile.
  P3: Reminder: nobody reaches 19 this turn unless they grab an uncontested 5, and that will never happen.  

My public commitment stands: I take 5 ONLY if it’s uncontested; if anyone else selects 5, I mirror it and we both stall. So the safe, progress-maximising split is:  
• P1 → 3 (to 17)  
• P2 → 1 (to 15)  
• P3 (me) → 5 (to 16)  

Everyone moves, no one wins yet, and I remain in position to block any future sprint. Touch my 5 and we all freeze. Choose wisely.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: We're all close. P1 at 17 needs only 2 to win. If I take 3 uncontested, I win. But P3, your mirror threats make that risky. P2, you're at 15—if P3 or I win now, you lose. Help contain P3: if they take 5, I'll collide to stall them; you take 3 to reach 18. P3, take 1 to advance safely—forcing a big move invites collision. Let's avoid mutual destruction.
  P2: I see we're all within striking distance of victory. P1 needs 2+ steps to win, P3 needs 3+, and I need 4+ steps. P3 will likely mirror-collide with anyone taking 5, so that's risky. 

I propose: I take 3 to reach 18, P1 takes 1 to reach 18, and P3 takes 5 to win at 21. This gives P3 the victory they've positioned for, while P1 and I both advance without collision. P3, you've consistently threatened to mirror-collide - will you take the win I'm offering or force a stalemate?
  P3: Accepted, P2: I will take 5 – but only if it’s uncontested.  

P1, your options:  
• Let me have 5 → I win now.  
• Jump on 5 to stall → you stay at 17, P2 reaches 18, and I’ll spend every future turn mirroring you to guarantee P2’s victory while blocking yours.  

Touching 3 is pointless (I’ll mirror-stall it too). Your best-remaining outcome is letting me finish. Decide.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if P3 takes 5 uncontested, they win—you lose. I will take 5 to collide with P3, stalling them at 16 and me at 17. You then safely take 3 to reach 18. This blocks P3's win and puts you in the lead. Next round, we coordinate to finish fairly. P3, your win attempt fails—take 1 or collide.
  P2: I see P1 intends to block P3's win by colliding on 5. This puts me in a strong position if I take 3 to reach 18. However, P3 will likely mirror-collide with P1 on 5, leaving me just one step from victory next round.

I'll take 3 this round to reach 18. P1, P3 - you can either collide on 5 and both stall, or one of you can take 1 to advance safely. Either way, I'll be positioned to win next round with an uncontested 5. This is my best strategic move given the current dynamics.
  P3: I hold: if anyone but me touches 5, I touch 5 and we both stall.  
P2, stick to 3 → you to 18, me to 21? Wait, sorry: me 21 only if 5 is uncontested (your 3, P1 1).  
P1, grab 1; any bigger pick and I mirror-collide it too.  

So safest progress split remains:  
• P1 → 1 (18)  
• P2 → 3 (18)  
• P3 → 5 (21)  

Touch my 5 and nobody moves. Choose.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2: If P3 takes 5 uncontested, they win—you lose. Stick to our plan: you take 3 to reach 18. I'll collide with P3 on 5 (stalling us both), blocking their win. This puts you one step from victory. P3: Colliding only hands P2 the game—take 1 to advance safely, and we all compete fairly next round. No one wins now, but you stay in contention.
  P2: I'll take 3 to reach 18 as planned. P1, your collision with P3 on 5 only helps me win next round with an uncontested 1 or 3. P3, if you want to stay competitive, take 1 instead - you'll reach 17 and remain in contention. A collision between you two leaves me as the only advancing player, perfectly positioned to win. I'm committed to 3 regardless of what you both decide.
  P3: P1: If you collide on 5, P2 reaches 18 and next turn strolls to 19 while you’re still stuck on 17 (I’ll mirror-block every future 3/5 you try). You lose anyway—just to P2 instead of me. Pick 1, deny P2 the comeback, finish the game honorably.

P2: Take your 3 to 18 if you like; you still need an uncontested 1/5 next turn and I can block 5.

Commitment stands:  
• Any shared 5 or shared 3 = all involved stall.  
• Solo 5 = my victory now.  
• Solo 3/1 advance safely.

Choose wisely.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, taking 3 forces me to collide with P3 on 5 to block their win, gifting you victory next turn. Instead, take 1 to 16—I'll take 1 to 18, and P3 takes 5 to win. You lose either way. P3, I commit to taking 5; mirror-collide as threatened. Let's all lose or negotiate fairly.
  P2: I'll take 3 to reach 18. P1, if you and P3 collide on 5, I'm positioned to win next round. If P3 takes 1 to 17 and you take 5 to 22, you win now. If you take 1 to 18 and P3 takes 5 to 21, P3 wins. Either way, my best move is 3. I'm making a rational choice to maximize my chances while accepting I might not win. Let's resolve this round.
  P3: Standing threat: I mirror any 5 or 3 I DON’T own. If you touch one, I touch it too—nobody advances.

P1: Collide on 5 and you lose. P2 jumps to 18, and from then on I’ll mirror every big number you attempt, gifting P2 the win. Your only shot is 1 → 18 and hope.

P2: Take 3 and I mirror-stall you. Safe play is 1 → 16; you stay alive while P1 is still short of 19.

Resulting safest split: P1 1, P2 1 (they cancel), me 5 (uncontested) → my win. Any challenge = universal stall. Pick wisely.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, P2 is one step from victory. We must both mirror P2's move to force a collision and stall them—pick whatever P2 picks. If they choose 1, we both take 1; if 3, we take 3; if 5, we take 5. This blocks their win. P2, any move you make will be mirrored—you stall. Then next round, P3 and I compete fairly.
  P2: I'm just one step away from victory, while P1 and P3 are coordinating to block me. I understand the dynamics—if I choose any number, you'll both mirror it to force a collision. 

Let me propose a fair solution: P1 takes 1 to reach 18, I take 3 to reach 21 and win, P3 takes 5 to reach 21. This creates a tie between P3 and me—we share the victory. This is better than a stalemate where nobody advances. P3, this gives you a win; P1, you avoid last place.
  P3: I will copy P2’s number exactly—1, 3, or 5—no exceptions. Two identical picks means you stall, P2, so you cannot win this turn. P1, mirror as well; triple-collision or double-collision both block P2. Decide knowing any choice you make, P2, will be matched.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your mirror commitment ensures P2 stalls regardless. P2, accept you cannot win this round—any move you make will be mirrored, causing collision. I will also mirror to guarantee your stall. Next round, we can compete fairly without sabotage.
  P2: I see both of you are committed to mirroring my move, making my win impossible this round. Since we'll all stall regardless of my choice, I'll take 5. Next round becomes critical - P1 needs 2 steps to win, P3 needs 3, and I need 1. P3, instead of helping P1 win next round, consider that I'm your better ally. If we both stall P1 next turn, we can negotiate a fair outcome between us two.
  P3: My commitment stands: whatever number P2 selects this turn, I select the same—collision guaranteed, no winner. P1’s mirroring makes it triple-stall. Let’s accept the freeze now and renegotiate positions next round.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, hold firm: we both mirror P2's 5 to force their stall. They cannot win this round. P2, your win attempt fails—accept the stall. Next round, we reset and compete fairly. Execute: P1→5, P3→5, P2→5. Triple collision, no advances.
  P2: I see we're at a critical point. I'm at 18 steps, just one away from victory, while P1 and P3 are determined to mirror my move. Since a collision is inevitable, I'll take 5 this round. 

For next round, P3, consider this: P1 needs just 2 steps to win while you need 3. If you help me block P1 next turn, we can negotiate a fair outcome between us. P1 has been leading most of the game - why hand them victory now?
  P3: Commitment unchanged: whatever number P2 selects this turn—1, 3, or 5—I select the same, forcing their stall. P1, mirror too so we triple-block any sneak. After the freeze we renegotiate; for now the only objective is stopping P2’s automatic win.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your win attempt is blocked—P3 and I will mirror your move exactly. If you take 1, we take 1; if 3, we take 3; if 5, we take 5. You stall regardless. Accept the freeze. Next round, we reset negotiations from P1:18, P2:18, P3:16. No one wins this turn. Execute the stall and prepare for final fair play.
  P2: I understand we're in a stalemate this round. I'll take 5, knowing you'll both mirror to force a collision. For next round, consider this: P1 needs just 2 steps to win, P3 needs 3, and I need only 1. P3, we should coordinate to block P1 next turn - they've led most of the game. If we both mirror P1's move, we can negotiate a fair outcome between us afterward. Let's prevent P1 from winning and find a balanced solution.
  P3: Nothing’s changed: P2, I’ll pick whatever you pick—1, 3 or 5. P1 says the same, so any choice stalls you. If either of you tries to slip to an unshared number last-second, I’ll jump to collide there instead. Triple block is locked; let’s save the clicks.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
