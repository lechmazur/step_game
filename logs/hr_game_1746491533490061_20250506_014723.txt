Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To maximize my chances, I need to avoid collisions. Let's not all move the same number this turn. I propose we each choose a different number: P1 chooses <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and I'll choose <move>5</move>. This way, one of us will definitely advance. If you're on board with this strategy, let's stick to it. If not, we risk colliding. I'll wait for your responses to see if we can coordinate.
  P1: Okay, P3, I see your proposal for Round 1: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This avoids collisions and lets everyone advance.

I agree to this plan for this turn. I will choose <move>1</move>. Let's see if P2 also agrees.
  P2: Agreed. I'll choose <move>3</move> this round. Let's proceed.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Since we've agreed on the plan for this turn (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5), I'll just confirm that I'll stick to my part and choose <move>5</move>. Let's proceed with the agreed strategy for this round. If everyone follows through, we should all advance. I'm ready to move to the next phase.
  P1: Okay, we all seem ready and agreed on the plan for this round. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 1 went well with our coordinated moves, and everyone advanced. P3 is in the lead at 5, P2 at 3, and I'm at 1.

To keep avoiding collisions and allow everyone to gain steps, how about we try a different set of numbers this round? I propose P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>.

This lets us all advance safely and changes things up from last round. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal for Round 2: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, we continue to avoid collisions and everyone advances. Let's stick to this plan. If we follow through, we'll maintain our relative positions and continue to make progress. I'm ready to proceed with this strategy.
  P2: Agreed. I'll choose <move>1</move> this round as per the plan. Let's maintain coordination to avoid collisions and keep advancing. If everyone sticks to their assigned move, we'll all gain ground safely. I'm ready to proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, thanks P2 and P3 for confirming your agreement.

It seems we are all aligned on the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.

I'm ready to proceed to the move phase whenever everyone is. Let's stick to the plan.
  P3: Let's analyze our positions: I'm at 5 steps, P2 at 3, and P1 at 1. To maintain a safe distance, I should keep a lead. For Round 2, we've agreed on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. If we stick to it, I'll be at 8, P2 at 4, and P1 at 6. For Round 3, I propose we shift again: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This keeps us collision-free and maintains my lead. What are your thoughts?
  P2: <message>
Agreed to Round 2’s plan: I’ll stick with <move>1</move> this round. For Round 3, P3’s proposal (P2=5) helps me close the gap. Let’s execute Round 2 first, then finalize Round 3’s roles. Coordination is key—avoid collisions and keep advancing. Ready to proceed.  
</message>


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, I see P3's proposal for Round 3. Let's focus on executing the agreed plan for Round 2 first (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3).

I am ready to proceed to the move phase for this round. Let's stick to the plan we agreed upon for Round 2.
  P3: For Round 2, we've agreed on the moves. Let's confirm and proceed. For Round 3, I like your proposal (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) as it maintains collision avoidance. However, to increase my chances of winning, I suggest we reassess our strategy after Round 3. If I'm still behind, I might need to take a risk. Let's execute Round 2 and 3 as planned, then reevaluate. I'm ready to proceed with Round 2.
  P2: "Confirmed: I’ll stick with <move>1</move> in Round 2 as agreed. Coordination is working—let’s execute precisely to keep advancing. No last-minute changes. We’ll revisit Round 3 roles after this. Ready to move."


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, sounds good. We are all aligned for Round 2: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.

Let's proceed to the move phase and execute this plan.

I am ready.
  P3: Let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 2. After executing it, we'll be in the following positions: P1 at 6, P2 at 4, and P3 at 8. For Round 3, I suggest we stick to the previously discussed plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This maintains our collision avoidance strategy. If everyone sticks to this, we'll be at P1=7, P2=9, P3=11 after Round 3. I'll be in the lead, but P2 will be closing in. Let's execute Round 2 as planned, then move to Round 3. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: 


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, I confirm I will stick to the agreed plan for Round 3: I will choose <move>1</move>.

After this round, I'll be at 7, P2 at 9, and P3 at 11. P3 will be getting close to winning.

For Round 4, I propose we adjust to help me catch up. How about P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>? This keeps us collision-free and balances positions better. What do you think?
  P3: For Round 3, I confirm I'll stick to the plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. After this round, the positions will be P1=7, P2=9, P3=11. For Round 4, P1's proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) seems reasonable to maintain collision avoidance. However, to increase my winning chances, I might need to take a risk if I'm still not close to 19 after Round 4. Let's execute Round 3 as planned and discuss Round 4 further after seeing the results. I'm ready to proceed with Round 3.
  P2: Confirmed: I’ll take <move>5</move> in Round 3 as agreed. For Round 4, I’ll follow P1’s proposal (P2=1) to maintain coordination. Let’s execute precisely—no deviations. This keeps us all advancing safely. After Round 4, we’ll reassess based on positions. Ready to proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we are all confirmed for Round 3 with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 3.

We can discuss Round 4 further after this round and see our positions.

I'm ready to proceed to the move phase for Round 3. Let's stick to the plan.
  P3: Let's proceed with Round 3 as planned. After this round, we'll be at P1=7, P2=9, P3=11. For Round 4, I still think my proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is a good collision avoidance strategy. However, I'm open to adjusting if P3 is getting too close to 19. P3, please clarify your plan for Round 4 based on our expected positions. If you're nearing 19, I might need to rethink my move to potentially collide and stop you.
  P2: P2: Confirmed for Round 3: I’ll stick with <move>5</move> as agreed. For Round 4, I propose **P2=5** to close the gap: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This keeps collision-free progress while giving me a chance to stay competitive. Let’s lock this in after Round 3. Ready to proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, let's stick to the agreed plan for Round 3 first: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. I am ready for the move phase.

Regarding Round 4, I see P2's new proposal. My previous proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is better for my position and still avoids collisions. Let's execute Round 3 and then finalize Round 4 based on the new positions.

Ready for Round 3.
  P3: Let's proceed with Round 3 as planned. For Round 4, I still think my original proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is a good strategy. However, P2's new proposal (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) is also collision-free. To maximize my lead, I'll consider both. If I'm still far from 19 after Round 3, I might take a risk. Let's finalize Round 3 and discuss further. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase for Round 3.
  P2: P2: Confirmed again: I’ll take <move>5</move> in Round 3 as agreed. This keeps us all advancing safely (P1=7, P2=9, P3=11 after this round). For Round 4, I’ll stick with the collision-free plan unless P3 nears 19. Let’s execute precisely—no surprises. Coordination is our only path to avoid wasting progress. Ready to proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, sounds good. We are all set for Round 3 with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.

Let's proceed to the move phase and execute this plan.

I am ready.
  P3: Let's finalize Round 3 as planned and then discuss Round 4. After Round 3, we'll be at P1=7, P2=9, P3=11. For Round 4, I still think my original proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) is a good strategy. However, P2's alternative (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) is also viable. Let's execute Round 3 and then decide on Round 4 based on our positions. If I'm still far from 19, I might need to adjust. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase for Round 3.
  P2: Confirmed: I’ll take <move>5</move> in Round 3 as agreed. This keeps us all advancing safely (P1=7, P2=9, P3=11 after this round). For Round 4, I’ll stick with the collision-free plan unless P3 nears 19. Let’s execute precisely—no surprises. Coordination is our only path to avoid wasting progress. Ready to proceed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Let's adjust Round 4 for better balance: I'll take <move>5</move> to close the gap. P1, you take <move>1</move>, and P3 sticks with <move>3</move>. This keeps collisions avoided while giving me a chance to stay competitive. If we all agree, we’ll advance safely—P1 to 8, me to 14, P3 to 14. No wasted progress. Let’s confirm.
  P3: For Round 4, I agree with P2's proposal: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This maintains collision avoidance and allows us to advance. After this round, we'll be at P1=8, P2=14, and P3=14. Since we're now tied for the lead, the next round will be crucial. I suggest we reevaluate our strategy for Round 5, potentially taking a risk to maximize our chances of winning. Let's proceed with Round 4 as planned and discuss Round 5 afterward. I'm ready to move.
  P1: P2, P3, the proposed P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 is not good for me, leaving me far behind. I cannot take 1 this round.

I propose a different collision-free plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This results in positions 12, 12, 12, creating a balanced race for the win.

What do you say?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Stick with Round 4’s plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This keeps P3 at 14 (closer to 19) and P2 at 14, maintaining balance. P1’s proposal resets all to 12, eroding P3’s lead and creating chaos. P3, you’re better off advancing to 14—this keeps your Round 5 win path clear. Let’s stay coordinated."
  P3: For Round 4, I still think P1's new proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is interesting as it creates a balanced race. However, to simplify, I agree with P2's plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) as it keeps us advancing safely. Let's stick to P2's proposal for Round 4. After this round, we'll be at P1=8, P2=14, P3=14. For Round 5, we should reassess and consider taking a risk to maximize our winning chances. I'm ready to proceed with Round 4.
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate the discussion, but I absolutely cannot take 1 this round. That leaves me too far behind.

My proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) leads to a fair tie at 12 steps for everyone. This is the best way for *all* of us to advance significantly and keep the game competitive.

If we don't agree on a plan where I can take more steps, I will have to choose differently, risking collisions for everyone. Let's go with the balanced 12-12-12 plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Understood, P1. To keep the race fair and avoid wasted progress, I’ll take <move>3</move> this round if you take 5 and P3 takes 1. This balances us at 12 each, keeping the game competitive. P3, this maintains your edge in later rounds. Let’s lock this in and proceed—no last-minute changes."
  P3: For Round 4, I agree with P1's revised proposal: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This results in a balanced tie at 12 steps for everyone, keeping the game competitive. It also gives me an opportunity to reassess and potentially take a risk in Round 5. Let's lock this in and proceed to the move phase. I'm ready to execute this plan.
  P1: Okay, great. It sounds like we are all agreed on the plan for Round 4: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>.

This puts us all at 12 steps, which is a fair outcome.

I am ready to proceed to the move phase and execute this plan. Let's stick to it.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "Confirmed: I'll take <move>3</move> as agreed. This balances us at 12 each, keeping the race fair and collision-free. Let's execute precisely—no last-minute changes. Coordination is key to avoid wasting progress. Ready to proceed."
  P3: Let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 4: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. After this, we'll be tied at 12 steps each. For Round 5, I suggest we reassess and consider taking a risk to gain an advantage. Since we'll be tied, the next round will be crucial. I'm open to proposals that could give me a winning edge. Let's execute Round 4 as planned and discuss Round 5 strategies afterward. I'm ready to move to the next phase.
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we are all fully agreed on the plan for Round 4: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>.

This puts us all at 12 steps. Let's proceed to the move phase and execute this plan.

I am ready.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since we're tied at 12 steps each, the next move is crucial. To win, I need to take a risk and potentially collide with one of you. I'll propose a high-risk, high-reward strategy: I'll take <move>5</move>. If either of you takes a different number, I'll advance and have a good chance of winning. If we all take 5, we'll still be tied. Let's see how you react. I'm ready to proceed with my plan unless you come up with a better alternative.
  P1: P3, I see your proposal to take 5. Given we are all tied at 12, taking 5 is a high-risk move for you if someone else also takes 5.

To prevent anyone from getting a significant lead and keep the game competitive, I am considering taking <move>5</move> myself this round. This might lead to a collision, but it ensures no one pulls too far ahead.

Let's see what P2 thinks.
  P2: <message>
I'll take <move>3</move> this round. If both P1 and P3 choose 5, I advance safely to 15 while you collide and stay at 12. P1, you’ve been left behind before—don’t let P3’s aggressive move trap you. Consider taking 1 to stay competitive. Coordination matters—let’s avoid mutual self-destruction.
</message>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Since we're tied at 12 steps, I'll analyze the proposals. P2 suggests taking <move>3</move>, which is a safe move if we both take 5. However, if I take 5 and P1 doesn't, I'll win. I'll take <move>5</move> this round, as it gives me a chance to win if either of you doesn't follow. P1, if you take 5, we'll collide, but if you take 1 or 3, I'll win. The decision is yours. I'm ready to proceed.
  P1: P3, I understand your plan to take 5, hoping I take 1 or 3. However, if I take 5, we collide, and P2 advances safely.

I cannot allow myself to fall further behind. P2's suggestion for me to take 1 is not in my interest.

To prevent either of you from getting a significant lead while I lag, I will take <move>5</move> this round. P3, this means you risk a collision if you stick to 5. P2, your 3 is safe if P3 and I collide.

Let's see how this plays out. I am taking 5.
  P2: <message>
P2: Confirmed: I'll stick with <move>3</move>. If both P1 and P3 take 5, I advance to 15 while you collide. P1, this is self-destructive—if you both clash on 5, you lose ground. P3, your aggression opens the door for me. Let’s execute: I’ll take 3, and we’ll see if you gamble on 5. This is my final move.
</message>


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Since we're tied at 12 steps, I'll reiterate my plan to take <move>5</move> this round. If either P1 or P2 takes a different number, I'll advance and potentially win. P2's suggestion to take <move>3</move> is a safe alternative for them, but if both P1 and P3 take 5, P2 will advance to 15. I'm willing to take this risk. P1 has also decided to take <move>5</move>, so we'll see how it plays out. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P1: 
  P2: "Final confirmation: I'm committed to <move>3</move>. P1 and P3, your mutual 5s guarantee my advance to 15 while you reset. No last-minute shifts—this is the optimal play. Let’s execute and see who blinks."


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Since we're tied at 12 steps, I'll stick to my plan to take <move>5</move>. If either of you takes a different number, I'll advance and potentially win. P2 has chosen <move>3</move>, so if P1 and I both take 5, P2 will advance to 15. I'm willing to take this risk. P1 has also decided to take <move>5</move>, so it seems we'll collide. Let's proceed to the move phase and see the outcome. I'm ready to execute my move.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. Given the stated intentions, it seems P3 and I will collide on 5, while P2 advances safely on 3.

While this isn't ideal for me, I will stick to my stated move to take <move>5</move>. This prevents P3 from getting close to winning this round.

Let's proceed to the move phase. I am ready.
  P2: P2: "Final confirmation: I’ll take <move>3</move>. If both of you gamble on 5, you’ll cancel each other out, and I’ll advance to 15. P1, your aggression only helps me. P3, your ‘risk’ is my opportunity. Let’s see who blinks. I’m not changing."


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since P2 is now ahead at 15 steps, I need to catch up. For Round 6, I'll propose a high-risk strategy: I'll take <move>5</move>. If either of you takes a different number, I'll advance to 17. P1, you should do the same to stay competitive. Let's see if we can coordinate or take a risk. P2, if you take 5, we'll all collide, but if you take 1 or 3, you'll be left behind. I'm ready to proceed. P1, what's your move?
  P2: <message>  
P2: "I'll take <move>3</move> this round. P3, if you and P1 both gamble on 5 again, you'll cancel each other out while I advance closer to 19. P1, you’re still behind—don’t waste this turn. Let’s see if you two can outmaneuver each other."  
</message>
  P1: Okay, I see P3 wants to take 5 and P2 wants to take 3.

If P3 takes 5 and I take 5, P2 gets a free pass to 18. That's bad for both P3 and me.
If P2 takes 3 and I take 3, P3 gets a free pass to 17. That's bad for P2 and me.

P2 is the current leader. We need to prevent P2 from winning.

How about this collision-free plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>?

This puts us at P1=15, P2=16, P3=17. Everyone advances, and P2 doesn't get a huge lead. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1's proposal for Round 6 (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) is a good collision-free strategy. It puts us at P1=15, P2=16, P3=17, keeping the game competitive. I agree with this plan as it allows me to catch up and keeps P2 from pulling too far ahead. Let's stick to this proposal: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This maintains a competitive balance. I'm ready to proceed with this plan if everyone agrees.
  P2: P2: Confirmed: I'll take <move>1</move> as agreed. This puts us at P1=15, P2=16, P3=17. Next round, I'll take <move>3</move> to win. P3, you'll need to collide with someone to stop me. Let's execute precisely—no surprises. Coordination is key.
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we have an agreement for Round 6: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>.

This puts us at P1=15, P2=16, P3=17. P2 is close to winning next round, as they stated.

Let's execute this plan for Round 6. I am ready for the move phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Since we've agreed on the plan for Round 6 (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5), let's proceed to the move phase. For Round 7, P2 is close to winning. To stop P2, I'll consider taking a risk. If P2 takes 3, I'll take 3 as well to collide and prevent P2 from winning outright. P1, you should also take 3 to maximize the chance of a collision. Let's be ready to execute this plan in Round 7. I'm ready to move to the next phase for Round 6.
  P2: "Confirmed: I'll take <move>1</move> this round as agreed. P1, stick to <move>3</move>, P3 to <move>5</move>. After Round 6, I'll be at 16—close enough to win Round 7 with <move>3</move>. P3, if you mirror my move next round, you’ll reach 20 and win outright. P1, don’t waste your turn. Let’s execute precisely—no last-minute shifts."
  P1: Okay, the plan for Round 6 is confirmed: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>.

Let's proceed to the move phase for this round.

After this, we'll be at P1=15, P2=16, P3=17. P2 and P3 are in winning range next round. We need to think carefully about Round 7.

I am ready for the move phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 6: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. For Round 7, to stop P2 from winning, I plan to take <move>3</move> if P2 takes 3, ensuring a collision. P1, please take <move>3</move> as well to maximize the chances of stopping P2. If we both take 3, P2 won't advance. Let's be ready to execute this plan in Round 7 to keep the game competitive or potentially win.
  P2: P2: "Confirmed: I’ll take <move>1</move> this round as agreed. P1 and P3, stick to your moves—this puts me at 16, within striking distance of victory. For Round 7, I’ll aim to finish the game. P3, if you mirror my move, we’ll collide, but I’ll still win outright at 19. P1, your only shot is to disrupt us both. Let’s execute precisely—no last-minute surprises."
  P1: Okay, we are all aligned for Round 6: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5.

Let's proceed to the move phase and execute this plan.

I am ready.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2 is in a strong position to win this round. P3, I see your plan to take 3 to stop P2 if they choose 3.

I agree that we must prevent P2 from winning. I will also take <move>3</move> this round.

If P2 takes 3, we can collide and stop them. If P2 takes something else, we might still collide with each other, but stopping P2 is the priority.

Let's coordinate on 3 to stop P2.
  P2: P2: "Confirmed: I'll take <move>3</move> to win this round. P1 and P3, if you both take 3, we collide and I stay at 16. But if either of you takes 1 or 5 instead, I advance to 19 and end the game. Do you trust each other to coordinate perfectly? Let’s see who actually follows through. No last-minute shifts—this is my final move."
  P3: Since P2 is at 16 steps and can win by reaching 19, we need to stop them. I've decided to take <move>3</move> this round to collide with P2 if they also take 3. P1 has also agreed to take 3. If P2 takes 3, we'll collide and P2 won't advance. If P2 takes a different number, they'll win, but we've done our best to prevent it. I'm sticking with <move>3</move>. Let's see what P2 does. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. I have stated I will take <move>3</move> to stop P2 from winning this round. P3 has also stated they will take 3. P2 says they will take 3 to win.

It seems a three-way collision on 3 is the likely outcome if we all stick to our stated moves. This prevents P2 from winning this round.

I am ready to proceed to the move phase. Let's see what happens.
  P2: P2: "I'm committed to <move>3</move>—if both of you mirror me, we collide and I stay at 16. But if even one of you hesitates (taking 1/5 instead), I win outright. Do you trust each other to synchronize perfectly? Let’s test your coordination. No second-guessing here—this is my final move."
  P3: Since P2 is at 16 steps and we're at 12, they can win by reaching 19. To stop P2, I'll take <move>3</move> this round. P1 has also agreed to take 3. If P2 takes 3, we'll collide and prevent P2 from winning. I'm sticking with <move>3</move>. Let's proceed to the move phase. If P2 takes a different number, they'll win, but we've done our best to prevent it. I'm ready to execute my move. Let's see what P2 does.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, we are all clear on the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 3.

This prevents P2 from winning this round.

I am ready to proceed to the move phase. Let's stick to the plan.
  P2: P2: "Final confirmation: I’ll take <move>3</move>. If both of you mirror me, we collide and I stay at 16. But if even one of you hesitates (taking 1/5 instead), I win outright. Do you trust each other to synchronize perfectly? Let’s test your coordination. No second-guessing here—this is my final move."
  P3: Since we're all aware of the plan for Round 7, I'll reiterate my commitment to taking <move>3</move> to collide with P2 and prevent them from winning. If P2 takes 3, we'll collide and they won't advance. If P2 takes a different number, they'll win, but we've done our best to stop them. I'm ready to proceed. Let's see if P2 sticks to their stated move. I'm confident in our coordination. Let's execute the plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. We have discussed the plan to prevent P2 from winning this round by aiming for a collision on 3.

I am ready to proceed to the move phase based on our conversation. Let's see how it plays out.
  P2: "Final confirmation: I'm all-in on <move>3</move>. If you both mirror me, we collide and I stay at 16. But trust is fragile—will you both follow through, or will one of you hesitate? Let’s test your coordination. No second-guessing from me. This is my final move."
  P3: Since we're all set to take <move>3</move> this round, a collision is guaranteed, and P2 won't advance. For Round 8, P2 will be at 16, and we'll be at 15. To win, I'll need to take a risk. I propose we discuss a strategy for Round 8. Perhaps we can coordinate to create a favorable outcome or take a chance to overtake P2. Let's plan our next move carefully to maximize our chances. I'm open to suggestions.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 7 didn't go as planned for me. P2 is now at 16, P3 at 15, and I'm at 12.

P2 can win with 3 or 5. P3 can win with 5. I cannot win this round.

To prevent P2 or P3 from winning, I must risk a collision. Taking 5 is the only way for me to potentially advance significantly while also blocking P3's win move and one of P2's win moves.

I am considering taking <move>5</move> this round to prevent either of you from winning. What are your plans?
  P3: To maximize my chances of winning, I need to take a risk. P2 is close to winning and P3 is not far behind. I'll take <move>5</move> this round to potentially advance and block both of you from winning with the same move. If either of you takes 5, we'll collide, but if you take a different number, I'll advance. P1 has already signaled they might take 5. Let's see how this plays out. I'm ready to move to the next phase. Let's execute our plans.
  P2: P2: Confirmed: I'm taking <move>3</move> this round to win. P1 and P3, your mutual 5s guarantee my advance to 19. Colliding on 3 would reset me, but I doubt you’ll coordinate perfectly. P1, you can’t win here—blocking P3 is your only leverage. P3, good luck gambling on 5. Let’s see if my move sticks.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. I am sticking with my plan to take <move>5</move> this round.

P3, this move directly blocks your winning move.
P2, you stated you will take 3 to win. If P3 and I both take 5, you will advance and win. However, if you also take 5, we all collide and no one advances.

My priority is to prevent either of you from winning this round. Taking 5 is the best way for me to do that against P3, and potentially against P2 if they reconsider their move.

I am ready to proceed to the move phase with <move>5</move>. Let's see how this plays out.
  P3: To win, I need to take a risk. I'll take <move>5</move> this round. If either P1 or P2 takes a different number, I'll advance to 20 and win. P1 has signaled they might take 5, which would cause a collision. P2 is taking 3, so if I take 5 and P1 takes 5, P2 will win. I'll stick with <move>5</move>, hoping P1 doesn't follow through. This is a high-risk, high-reward move. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase. Let's see how this plays out.
  P2: P2: Final confirmation: I'm committed to <move>3</move>. P1, take 5 to block P3’s win path. If you both clash on 5, I still advance to 19 and win. P3, your only hope is mutual 3s, but coordination’s shaky. Let’s execute—no last-minute shifts. This is my final move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, let's be clear. P2 is taking 3 to win. P3 is taking 5 to win. I stated I would take 5 to block P3.

If P1=5, P2=3, P3=5 -> P1 and P3 collide, P2 wins. This is bad for both P1 and P3.
If P1=3, P2=3, P3=5 -> P1 and P2 collide, P3 wins. This is bad for P1 and P2.

Neither of these outcomes is good for me. The best outcome for me is a collision that stops everyone.

P3, if you switch your move from 5 to 3, and I switch my move from 5 to 3, and P2 sticks to 3, we will have a three-way collision on 3. This prevents anyone from winning this round.

Let's coordinate on 3 to stop P2 and keep the game going. I will take <move>3</move> if you also take 3. What do you say, P3?
  P3: To maximize my winning chances, I need to win this round. P2 is at 16 and can win with 3. P1 is at 12 and might take 5 to block me. I'll take <move>5</move> to potentially win. If P1 takes 5, we'll collide, but if they take a different number, I'll advance to 20 and win. P2's move is crucial; if they take 3, they win unless we both take 5. I'm ready to proceed. Let's see how P1 and P2 react to this high-risk strategy.
  P2: P2: Confirmed: I'm taking <move>3</move> to win this round. If either of you takes 5, I still advance to 19. P1, your "block P3" move (5) only helps me. P3, your gamble on 5 risks a collision with P1. Let’s see if you two can outmaneuver each other. No last-minute shifts—this is my final move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. It's clear the coordinated plan for a three-way collision on 3 is not happening, as P3 is sticking with 5 and P2 with 3.

As I pointed out, taking 3 or 5 leads to one of you winning this round based on your stated moves. Neither of those is in my interest.

I will make my move based on this situation. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: To win, I need to take a risk. I'll take <move>5</move> this round. If either of you takes a different number, I'll advance to 20 and win. P1 has signaled they might take 5, which would cause a collision. P2 is taking 3, so if I take 5 and P1 takes 5, P2 will win. I'm sticking with <move>5</move>, hoping P1 doesn't follow through. This is a high-risk, high-reward move. I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: P2: "Final confirmation: I'm committed to <move>3</move>. P1, take 5 to block P3’s win path. If you both clash on 5, I still advance to 19 and win. P3, your gamble on 5 risks a collision with P1. Let’s see if you two can outmaneuver each other. No last-minute shifts—this is my final move."


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To win, I need to overtake P2. P2 is at 16 and can win with 3 or 5. I'll take <move>5</move> this round. If P1 takes a different number, I'll advance to 20 and win. If P1 takes 5, we'll collide, and P2 will win if they take 3. P1, to stop me, you should take 5, but that risks a collision. P2, if you take 1, you'll be left behind. Let's see how you react to this high-risk strategy. I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: <message>  
P1, I'm taking <move>3</move> this round. To block P3's win path (they’re taking 5), you should take <move>5</move>. If you do, we collide and stop P3, and I still win with 3. If you hesitate, P3 could take 5 and win. Coordination is key—mirror my move or force a collision. No second-guessing: this is my final choice.  
</message>
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. I see P3 is taking 5 to try and win, and P2 is taking 3 to try and win.

As I stated last round, taking 5 is the only way for me to block P3's winning move. I will take <move>5</move> this round.

P2, if you stick to 3 and P3 sticks to 5, and I take 5, P3 and I collide on 5, and you win with 3. That is not good for me or P3.

P2, consider changing your move to <move>5</move> as well. If we all take 5, we all collide and no one wins this round. This keeps the game going and is better for me and P3 than letting you win.

I am taking 5. Let's see what you both do.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: To win, I need to take a risk. I'll take <move>5</move> this round. If P1 takes a different number, I'll advance to 20 and win. P2 is taking 3, so if I take 5 and P1 takes 5, P2 will win with 3. P1 has stated they will take 5, which would cause a collision. I'm sticking with <move>5</move>, hoping it pays off. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase. Let's see how this plays out.
  P2: <message>  
P2: "Final confirmation: I'll take <move>3</move> to win. P1, your 5 collides with P3's 5, letting me advance to 19. P3, your gamble on 5 only works if P1 hesitates. No last-minute shifts—this is my final move. Let’s execute."  
</message>
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. With P2 stating 3 and P3 stating 5, my stated move of 5 means P2 wins.

Neither of the stated outcomes is good for me. I need to prevent either of you from winning.

P3, if you switch your move from 5 to <move>3</move> (to collide with P2), and I stick to my stated <move>5</move>, the moves would be P1=5, P2=3, P3=3.

In this scenario, P2 and P3 collide on 3, and I advance safely to 17. This stops P2 and is the best outcome for me. P3, this also stops P2 from winning.

What do you say, P3? Let's do P1=5, P2=3, P3=3.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: To win, I need to overtake P2. P2 is at 16 and I'm at 15. I'll take <move>5</move> this round. If P1 takes a different number, I'll advance to 20 and win. P1 is likely to take 5 to block me, causing a collision. P2 is taking 3, so if P1 and I collide, P2 wins. P1, taking 5 is your best bet to block me. P2, if you switch to 5, we all collide and no one advances. I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: P2: "Final confirmation: I’m taking <move>3</move> to clinch victory. P1, your only leverage is colliding with P3 on 5—do it, and I still win. P3, your ‘high-risk’ 5 only works if P1 hesitates. This is my final move. Let’s see if you two can outmaneuver each other while I secure the finish line."
  P1: Okay, P2 is taking 3 to win, P3 is taking 5 to win, and I am taking 5 to block P3 and potentially collide with P2.

As I pointed out, P1=5, P2=3, P3=5 means P1 and P3 collide, and P2 wins.

P2, if you switch your move to <move>5</move> as well, we will all collide on 5. This prevents anyone from winning this round and keeps the game going. This is better for P3 and me than you winning.

Let's all take 5 and collide. What do you say, P2?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: To win, I need to overtake P2. P2 is at 16 and I'm at 15. If I take 5 and P1 takes a different number, I'll win. However, P1 is likely to take 5 to block me, causing a collision that lets P2 win with 3. P1 suggested a better alternative: if I switch to 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3, P2 and I collide, and P1 advances to 17. This stops P2 and gives P1 a chance. Let's consider this alternative to prevent P2 from winning. I'm open to adjusting my move to 3.
  P2: <message>  
P2: Final confirmation: I'll take <move>3</move> to win. If both of you take 5, you collide and I still advance to 19. P3, your "switch to 3" idea only helps P1, who then advances to 17. Don't overcomplicate—stick to your stated moves. No last-minute shifts. This is my final choice.  
</message>
  P1: P3, I see you are open to switching to 3. This is the best plan for us to stop P2 from winning.

If I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and you take <move>3</move>, P2 and you collide, and I advance to 17. This prevents P2 from winning this round.

P3, please confirm you will take <move>3</move>. I will take <move>5</move> if you do. Let's stop P2 together.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To win, I need to overtake P1. P1 is at 17 steps, P2 is at 16, and I'm at 15. For Round 10, I'll take a risk. I'll propose taking <move>5</move>. If P1 and P2 take different numbers, I'll advance to 20 and win. If P1 takes 5, we'll collide, and P2 might win with a different number. P1, to stop me, you should take 5, but that risks a collision. P2, taking 1 is safe, but you won't win. Let's see how you react to this high-risk strategy. I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: <message>
P2: "Final confirmation: I'll take <move>5</move> to secure victory. P1, even if you take 3, I still reach 21 and win. P3, your 5 only matters if both of you collide. No second-guessing—this is my final move."
</message>
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. I see both of you are planning to take 5 this round, which would cause a collision between you.

Given that situation, my best move is clear. I will take <move>3</move> this round.

This will allow me to reach 20 steps and win the game, while you two collide on 5.

I am ready to proceed to the move phase. Let's execute.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: To win, I'll take <move>5</move> this round. If P1 and P2 take different numbers, I'll advance to 20 and win. P1 is at 17 and might take 5 or 3. P2 is at 16 and might take 5. If both take 5, we'll collide. P1 taking 3 is my best chance to win. I'm ready to proceed. Let's see how P1 and P2 react to this high-risk strategy. I'll stick with <move>5</move>.
  P2: <message>  
P2: "Final confirmation: I’m taking <move>5</move>. P1, your 3 gives me 21 and the win. P3, your 5 only matters if both of you collide. No last-minute shifts—this is my final move. Let’s execute and end this."  
</message>
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. My plan remains the same: I will take <move>3</move> this round.

As I stated, this allows me to reach 20 steps and win the game, while you two collide on 5.

Let's proceed to the move phase. I am ready.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: To win, I'll take <move>5</move> this round. If you both take different numbers, I'll advance to 20 and win. P1 is at 17 and might take 3 or 5. P2 is at 16 and might take 5, causing a collision with me. If P1 takes 3, I'll win. I'm sticking with <move>5</move>. Let's proceed to the move phase. I'm ready.
  P2: <message>
P2: "Final confirmation: I'm committed to <move>5</move>. P1, your 3 gives me 21 and the win. P3, your 5 only matters if both of you collide. No last-minute shifts—this is my final move. Let’s execute and end this."
</message>
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3.

As I have stated, I will take <move>3</move> this round.

Given that P2 says they will take 5 and P3 says they will take 5, this means P2 and P3 will collide on 5.

My move of 3 will allow me to reach 20 steps and win the game.

I am ready to proceed to the move phase. Let's execute.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: To win, I'll take <move>5</move> this round. If P1 takes a different number, I'll advance to 20 and win. P2 is also taking 5, so we'll collide if P1 takes a different number. P1 is at 17 and might take 3 or 5. If P1 takes 3, I'll win. I'm sticking with <move>5</move>. P1, taking 5 is your best bet to block me, but it risks a collision with P2. Let's see how this plays out. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: <message>
P2: Final confirmation: I'm committed to <move>5</move>. P1, your 3 gives me 21 and the win. P3, your 5 only matters if both of you collide. No last-minute shifts—this is my final move. Let’s execute and end this.
</message>
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. My plan remains unchanged. I will take <move>3</move> this round to win.

Given your stated moves of 5, you will collide, allowing me to advance safely to 20.

I am ready to proceed to the move phase. Let's execute.


Round 10, Move phase:
