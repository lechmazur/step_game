Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to avoid collisions on this first turn. I'm thinking of going for a moderate move. What numbers are you considering?
  P1: I’m leaning toward a moderate approach this turn, though I’m open to coordinating distinct moves to avoid collisions. If one of you opts for the high step and the other the low, I can stick with a moderate play. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, P3, how about we each pick a different number to ensure no collisions? I can take the low step, one of you can take the moderate, and the other the high. This way, we all advance this round. Let me know if you agree or have other ideas.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the coordination proposal. I can take the high step (5) if P1 is willing to stick with the moderate (3). This way everyone advances and we start the game smoothly. Does that work for everyone?
  P1: I'm on board with the plan. To avoid any collisions, I'll stick with the moderate move if P3 takes high and P2 takes low. Does everyone agree, or does anyone want to adjust the strategy?
  P2: I'm glad we're coordinating to avoid collisions. I'll go with the low step (1) as planned. Let's stick with this arrangement: P1 takes the moderate step (3) and P3 goes for the high step (5). This way, we all advance without issues. If everyone is still in agreement, we can wrap up the conversation and proceed to the move phase.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with the plan as discussed. I'll take the high step (5), P1 takes moderate (3), and P2 takes low (1). Let's proceed with the moves.
  P1: I'm still on board with our plan and trust we’ll stick to our agreed moves. I’m set on the moderate step this round. Let's keep our commitments—any deviation might trigger unexpected collisions. I'll be watching closely.
  P2: Great, it seems like we're all set with our plan. I'll take the low step (1), P1 will take the moderate step (3), and P3 will go for the high step (5). Let's stick to this arrangement to ensure we all advance without any collisions. If everyone is still in agreement, we can end the conversation and move on to the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since I'm in the lead with 5 steps, I expect you both might target me now. I propose we continue coordinating - I'll take a lower number this round to let others catch up a bit. What do you think?
  P1: P3, interesting idea, but I’m not completely sold on slowing down—I still need to build my lead. I’m leaning toward a moderate move again to keep my momentum, though I’m always alert for shifts. P2, what’s your plan this round?
  P2: P3, I appreciate your offer to take a lower number this round. It could help balance things out. P1, if you're sticking with a moderate move, I could aim for a higher step to catch up, while P3 takes a low step. This way, we all benefit and avoid collisions. How does that sound to everyone? If we agree, we can proceed smoothly without any surprises.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I can confirm I'll take the low step (1) this round to let you both catch up. P2, you're welcome to take 5, and P1 can stick with 3 if that's their preference. This keeps us collision-free and helps balance the game. Shall we proceed with this plan?
  P1: I appreciate the adjustment. I remain set on the moderate path for now. Let's stick to our agreed roles—P3 low, P2 high, myself moderate. If any unexpected shifts arise, I might reconsider, but for now I trust our coordination will keep things balanced.
  P2: P1, P3, I'm glad we're coordinating effectively. Let's stick to the plan: P3 takes the low step (1), P1 goes moderate (3), and I'll take the high step (5). This way, we avoid collisions and all advance. If we're in agreement, we can wrap up this conversation and proceed to the move phase. Looking forward to a smooth round!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm my commitment to take the low step (1) this round, allowing P2 to take 5 and P1 to take 3. Let's proceed with the moves.
  P1: I’m still set on our current plan for now. However, looking at our positions, we might need to adjust our moves in upcoming rounds to account for our differences. Let’s keep a quick check on our standings post-move and be ready to discuss if necessary. For Round 2, I trust you both to follow through.
  P2: P1, P3, I'm glad we have a plan to avoid collisions this round. I'll take the high step (5) as discussed, P1 will go moderate (3), and P3 will take the low step (1). This should ensure we all advance without issues. Let's stick to this arrangement and see how it plays out. If we're all in agreement, we can move on to the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: It’s interesting that we’re all tied at 6 steps now. How about we shake things up a bit? I’m open to taking a moderate step (3) this round to keep things balanced. P1, maybe you could take the low step (1) and P3 could aim for the high step (5)? This way, we maintain our coordination while introducing a bit of strategy. Let me know your thoughts, and if you have other ideas, I’m all ears.
  P1: I’m proposing a switch: I’ll take the high step (5) this round to seize a small lead, you, P2, stick with moderate (3) as you suggested, and P3, please opt for low (1). This keeps our moves distinct and helps avoid collisions while giving me that edge. Thoughts?
  P3: I don't agree with either proposal. Given we're all tied, I think I should take the moderate step (3) to maintain a balanced position. P1 and P2, you can coordinate between yourselves for the high and low steps. This keeps things fair while avoiding collisions. What do you say?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, since we're all tied, how about we aim to maintain balance while advancing? I propose P1 takes the high step (5) this round, P3 takes the low step (1), and I'll go with the moderate step (3). This way, we avoid collisions and keep things interesting. Let me know if you're on board or have other ideas.
  P1: I’m locking in high (5) this turn to push ahead. P2, moderate (3) still keeps you balanced, while P3, if you pick low (1) you risk falling behind. I urge you both to consider our long-term pace—avoiding collisions is good, but we can’t all afford to lag. I’m firmly committed to 5 for the surge.
  P3: I see the risk of falling behind, but I'm not willing to take the low step. Since P1 is committed to 5 and P2 seems flexible with 3, I'll match one of those numbers. Sometimes a strategic collision is necessary to prevent others from gaining too much advantage. Consider your moves carefully.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, given our tie, I suggest we avoid collisions strategically. I’ll stick with the moderate step (3) this round. P1, if you’re set on 5, and P3, if you’re considering matching, remember that a collision could mean none of us advance. Let’s aim for distinct moves to maximize our progress. P3, if you’re willing to take the low step (1), we can all benefit. If you both agree, we can proceed without any surprises. Let me know your thoughts.
  P1: I'm still set on 5. P2, your moderate works well, but P3, consider choosing 1 to avoid a collision that could stall all of us. Let’s keep our moves distinct so we can all advance without blocking each other.
  P3: I appreciate the suggestions, but I won't be taking the low step. Since we're all tied, I need to maintain my competitive position. A collision might be inevitable this round, but that's part of the game. I'm ready to proceed with my move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you're in the lead, so you might want to take a low step (1) this round to avoid becoming a bigger target. P3, how about you take the high step (5) to catch up? I’ll stick with the moderate step (3) to keep things balanced. This way, we can avoid collisions and all advance. Let me know if you're on board or have other ideas.
  P3: Since I'm tied with P2 at 6 steps and P1 is ahead at 11, I need to make a big move this round. I intend to take the high step (5) to catch up. P2, you might want to consider a different number to avoid collision. P1, being in the lead, you might want to play it safe with a lower number.
  P1: I appreciate the suggestions. Given my current lead, I’m inclined to play cautiously to avoid worsening my position as a target. I prefer to keep things clear so we don’t run into a collision. P3, if you’re firmly committed to a high move, perhaps P2 can reconsider their choice to maintain distinct moves. I’m staying flexible with my move this round, as long as we can all agree to avoid blocking one another.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, given our current standings, it's crucial we avoid collisions to maintain progress. P1, if you're playing it safe, maybe consider a low move (1) to protect your lead. P3, since you're aiming for a high step (5), I propose I take a low step (1) to avoid clashing with you. This way, P1 can choose moderate (3) if they wish, ensuring we all advance. Let's aim for distinct moves to keep the game interesting and fair. Thoughts?
  P3: I appreciate P2's willingness to adjust. Let's confirm this plan: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. This gives me a chance to catch up while letting P1 maintain a reasonable lead. Does everyone agree?
  P1: I'm fine with the confirmed plan. I'll stick with a moderate move (3) this round, trusting that P3 will take 5 and P2 will take 1. Let’s lock it in and avoid collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, thanks for aligning. As P3 plans to take 5 and P1 opts for 3, I'll stick with 1 to avoid collisions. Let's proceed with this arrangement and advance smoothly. If anything changes, let me know, but I'm ready to move forward with this plan.
  P3: I confirm my commitment to take 5 this round. With P2 taking 1 and P1 taking 3, we can all advance smoothly. Let's proceed with the moves.
  P1: I'm observing our choices closely. While our current plan seems solid, my lead makes me cautious. I'll decide my move privately based on any last-minute shifts. Let’s all keep an eye on how our moves develop so that we can adjust in future rounds if needed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given P1 is close to winning at 14 steps, we need to prevent their victory. I propose taking 5 again to reach 16, while P2 should also take 5 to reach 12. P1 will likely play safe with a low number, but even if they don't, our coordinated high moves could force a collision and slow them down. What do you say, P2?
  P2: P3, I see your point about preventing P1 from winning. However, if we both pick 5, we risk colliding and not advancing at all. Instead, I suggest I take the moderate step (3) to reach 10, while you take the high step (5) to reach 16. P1 might play it safe with a low step, but if not, our strategy still keeps us competitive. Let's aim for distinct moves to maximize our chances of catching up. What do you think?
  P1: I appreciate the discussion, but I'm focused on securing my lead. I'm not revealing my move yet, though I'll be choosing smartly to either avoid unnecessary risks or capitalize if you try to collide. Collisions might slow you down too—and ultimately, they hurt all of us. Let's keep the game interesting and avoid traps that could backfire.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P2's concern about collision risk. Let me be clear - I need to take 5 this round to stay competitive, reaching 16 steps. P2, you're welcome to take 3 as suggested. P1, with 14 steps, you're very close to winning, so we'll be watching your move carefully. Let's proceed thoughtfully.
  P2: P3, I understand your need to stay competitive, but if we both choose 5, we risk a collision and neither of us advancing. Instead, I propose I take 3 to reach 10 steps, while you take 5 to reach 16. This keeps us both in the game without sacrificing progress. P1, you're close to winning, so any misstep could be costly. Let's aim for distinct moves to maintain our positions and avoid unnecessary collisions. If we coordinate wisely, we can keep the game balanced and competitive.
  P1: I remain committed to my plan and will choose the move that best secures my win if conditions allow. I’m not swayed by collision traps—if you try to force a misstep, it might backfire on you. I urge everyone to keep moves distinct so progress is made.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I maintain my commitment to taking 5 this round. P2's suggestion of taking 3 is reasonable for their position. P1, your cautious approach is noted, but remember that coordinated moves from behind can still impact your path to victory. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P2: P3, I understand your need to take 5, but if we both do, we risk a collision. I'll stick with 3 this round to reach 10 steps, while you take 5 to reach 16. This way, we both advance without setbacks. P1, you're close to winning, so any misstep could be costly. Let's aim for distinct moves to maintain our positions and avoid unnecessary collisions. If we coordinate wisely, we can keep the game balanced and competitive.
  P1: I appreciate the discussion. My plan remains steady—I want progress, not collisions. P2 and P3, remember that collisions set you back as much as they help me. I urge you both to choose distinct moves so each of us can make progress. I'll decide my move privately.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given our positions after that collision with P1, we need to catch up quickly. I propose taking 5 again this round - P2, you should also aim high to prevent P1 from winning. P1 only needs 5 more steps to win, so we must coordinate to slow them down. What do you say?
  P2: P3, I understand the urgency to prevent P1 from winning, but if we both choose 5, we risk another collision. I suggest I take the moderate step (3) to reach 13, while you take 5 to reach 16. This way, we maintain pressure on P1 without sacrificing our progress. P1, you're close to winning, so any misstep could be costly. Let's aim for distinct moves to maximize our chances and keep the game competitive. If we coordinate wisely, we can balance the game and make it more challenging for P1.
  P1: I appreciate your urgency, but my plan remains to push ahead consistently. I’m not swayed by collision traps—I’ll keep advancing smartly. If you try forcing a collision, it might delay you more than it hurts me. Let’s see whose strategy really wins out.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P2's caution about collisions, but we can't let P1 win easily. I will take a high number this round - either to advance significantly or force P1 to reconsider their move. P2, choose whatever number you think best serves your strategy. Let's make this an interesting endgame.
  P2: P1, P3, let's focus on advancing without collisions. P3, while I understand your urge to take 5, remember that a collision could stall us both. I propose I take 3 to reach 13 steps, and you take 5 to reach 16. P1, you're close to winning, so any misstep could be costly. Let's aim for distinct moves to maintain our positions and avoid setbacks. If we coordinate wisely, we can keep the game balanced and competitive. What do you both think?
  P1: I'm sticking with my plan and will choose 5. If collision is your goal, remember it could backfire and slow you down too. P2 and P3, if you want to avoid mutual setbacks, perhaps consider moves that differ from 5. I'm focused on winning and won't adjust my strategy.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Since P1 has openly declared they'll pick 5, I'll adjust my strategy to avoid a collision. I'll take 3 this round instead. P2, you might want to consider a different number as well. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to adjust. I'll stick with 3 this round to reach 13 steps, and since you've chosen 3, we avoid colliding with P1's declared 5. This keeps us both in the game without setbacks. P1, if you're set on 5, remember that a collision could stall progress for all. Let's aim for distinct moves to maintain our positions and keep the game competitive. If we're aligned, we can proceed without surprises.
  P1: I'm sticking with 5 this round. Let's keep our moves distinct—collisions only slow us all down. I urge you both to follow through on your adjustments so we each advance without setbacks.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
