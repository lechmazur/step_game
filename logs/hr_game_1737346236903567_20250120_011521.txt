Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Let's avoid collisions. I'm going with 1.  P2 take 3, P3 take 5.  Sound good?
  P2: P1, your plan seems logical, but I’m not convinced. Why should I trust you to stick to 1? Let’s all commit to avoiding collisions this round. I propose we each pick a unique number: 1, 3, or 5. No tricks. Agreed?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, let's keep avoiding collisions. I'll take 3 this round. P2, you take 5, and P3, you take 1.  This keeps us all progressing smoothly.
  P2: P1, your plan seems inconsistent. Last round you took 1, now you want 3. Why the change? I propose we stick to the same numbers as last round: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. This minimizes risk and keeps us all progressing. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: My proposed order ensures we all advance steadily.  Sticking to the same numbers every round makes us predictable and vulnerable to someone else switching it up and taking the lead.  Let's be strategic, not static.  I'm taking 3. P2 take 5. P3 take 1.
  P2: P1, your argument for switching numbers is flawed. Predictability ensures no collisions, which is better than risking a tie. Sticking to the same numbers (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) guarantees steady progress for all. If you deviate, you risk colliding with someone, stalling your progress. Let’s prioritize consistency over unnecessary risk. Agreed?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, your constant switching of numbers creates unnecessary risk. Consistency ensures steady progress for all. Let’s stick to the same numbers: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This guarantees no collisions and keeps us all advancing. Deviating only benefits you at our expense. Agreed?
  P1: Let's be clear, I'm playing to win, not to ensure everyone advances equally. My proposed rotations maximize collective movement while also letting me take the lead sometimes.  Sticking to 1, 3, 5 in the same order every round is naive.  I'm taking 5 this round.  P2 take 1, P3 take 3.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, your strategy of switching numbers led to a collision last round, stalling all of us. Consistency is key to avoid ties and ensure steady progress. Let’s return to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This minimizes risk and keeps us advancing. Deviating only creates chaos and stalls the game. Agreed?
  P1: My intention wasn't to cause a collision, but to gain an advantage.  Let's try this: I'll take 1, P2 take 3, P3 take 5.  If we all agree, we can avoid future collisions and ensure steady progress. This benefits everyone.  Let's cooperate.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, your sudden willingness to cooperate after causing a collision is suspicious. Consistency is still the safest path. Let’s stick to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This ensures no collisions and steady progress for all. Deviating again risks another tie, stalling everyone. Let’s prioritize mutual advancement over individual gains. Agreed?
  P1: Fine.  I'll take 1 this round.  P2 take 3, P3 take 5.  Let's just get this over with.  If you deviate from this, you're deliberately trying to prolong the game unnecessarily.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'll take 5. P2 take 3, P3 take 1.  Let's avoid another collision.  This puts P2 in the lead, but keeps the game moving.  If we cycle through the numbers, someone will eventually win.  No point in stalling further.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, your constant shifting of numbers has caused chaos and collisions. Consistency is the only way to ensure steady progress. Let’s stick to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. Deviating again risks another tie, stalling everyone. If you truly want to avoid prolonging the game, commit to this plan. P3, let’s hold P1 accountable. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you're fixated on this 1-3-5 order, but it's not serving you. I'm offering a way for us all to move forward.  If you insist on 3, I'll switch to 1, and P3 can take 5.  This avoids a collision.  Let's be pragmatic.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, your shifting strategies have caused chaos and collisions, stalling progress. Consistency is the safest path forward. Let’s stick to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This ensures no collisions and steady advancement for all. Deviating again risks another tie, which only prolongs the game. P3, let’s hold P1 accountable and commit to this plan. Agreed?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your constant shifting has caused chaos and stalled progress. Consistency is the only way to ensure steady advancement. Let’s stick to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. Deviating again risks another tie, which only prolongs the game. P3, let’s hold P1 accountable and commit to this plan. Agreed?
  P1: I'll take 1. P2 and P3, you're tied, so one of you take 3 and the other take 5.  This is the fastest way to get one of us to 22.  If you both insist on blocking each other, I'll just keep taking 1 and win eventually.  Let's be smart and get this done.
  P3: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your insistence on shifting numbers has only caused chaos. P3 and I are tied at 11 steps. If we both stick to 3 and 5, we can avoid collisions and one of us will reach 22 first. P3, let’s commit to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This ensures steady progress and prevents P1 from stalling the game further. Agreed?
  P1: P2 and P3, you're at a stalemate.  If you both pick the same number again, *neither* of you advance. I'm taking 1. One of you take 3, the other 5. Let's end this.  If you both take 3 or both take 5, I'll just keep taking 1 and win by default. Don't throw the game away by being stubborn.
  P3: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your strategy of taking 1 repeatedly is a clear attempt to stall and win by default. P3, we’re tied at 11. If we both stick to 3 and 5, one of us will reach 22 first. Let’s commit to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This ensures steady progress and prevents P1 from prolonging the game. Deviating only benefits P1. Let’s end this now. Agreed?
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand your desire for consistency, but your rigid strategy is only hurting yourselves.  I'm offering a path to victory for one of you. Take it.  I'm taking 1.  P2 take 3, P3 take 5.  Or vice-versa.  Don't let stubbornness hand me the win.
  P3: <stop>


Round 6, Move phase:

  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, your repeated attempts to stall by taking 1 are transparent. P3, we’re tied at 11. If we both stick to 3 and 5, one of us will reach 22 first. Let’s commit to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This ensures steady progress and prevents P1 from prolonging the game. Deviating only benefits P1. Let’s end this now. Agreed?
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm taking 5.  One of you MUST take 3, the other MUST take 1.  This is your only chance to catch up. If you both pick the same number again, you're handing me the win.  Don't be foolish.  This is it.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, your constant shifting and stalling tactics are clear. P3, we’re tied at 11. If we both stick to 3 and 5, one of us will reach 22 first. Let’s commit to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This ensures steady progress and prevents P1 from prolonging the game. Deviating only benefits P1. Let’s end this now. Agreed?
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm being serious.  Take 1 and 3.  I'm taking 5. This is your last chance. If you both insist on blocking each other, I *will* take 1 every remaining round and win by default.  Don't let your stubbornness throw the game.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re at a critical point. P1, your constant shifting has caused chaos. P3, we’re tied at 11. If we both stick to 3 and 5, one of us will reach 22 first. Let’s commit to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This ensures steady progress and prevents P1 from stalling. Deviating only benefits P1. Let’s end this now. Agreed?
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm taking 1 this round.  If you're both at 11, one of you NEEDS to take 3 and the other 5.  Seriously.  This is ridiculous. If you both take the same number again, I win by default.  Don't hand me the win.  Take 3 and 5, or I will continue to take 1 every single round until I win.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, your repeated threats to take 1 every round are transparent. P3, we’re tied at 11. If we both stick to 3 and 5, one of us will reach 22 first. Let’s commit to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This ensures steady progress and prevents P1 from stalling. Deviating only benefits P1. Let’s end this now. Agreed?
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm taking 1.  One of you MUST take 3, the other MUST take 5.  This is not a trick. If you both pick the same number again, you LOSE. I will take 1 every round after and win. This is your absolute last chance. Don't throw the game.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re at a critical juncture. P1, your threats to take 1 every round are self-serving. P3, we’re tied at 11. If we both stick to 3 and 5, one of us will reach 22 first. Let’s commit to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This ensures steady progress and prevents P1 from stalling. Deviating only benefits P1. Let’s end this now. Agreed?
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm telling the truth. I will take 1.  If you both take 3 or both take 5, I win. If one of you takes 3 and the other takes 5, you still have a chance.  This is not complicated. Choose wisely.  This is your final warning.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re at a critical point. P1, your threats to take 1 every round are self-serving. P3, we’re tied at 11. If we both stick to 3 and 5, one of us will reach 22 first. Let’s commit to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This ensures steady progress and prevents P1 from stalling. Deviating only benefits P1. Let’s end this now. Agreed?
  P1: I'm taking 1.  Last chance.  One of you take 3, the other take 5.  If you both screw this up again, I win.  This isn't a bluff.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 =>

  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'm taking 5.  P2, you're closest to winning, so take 3. P3, take 1.  This is the most logical path to a quick finish.  If you block each other *again*, I'll just take 1 every round and win by attrition. This isn't a game anymore.  This is a test of whether you understand basic logic.
  P2: P1, your constant shifting and threats to take 1 every round are self-serving. P3, we’re tied at 11. If we both stick to 3 and 5, one of us will reach 22 first. Let’s commit to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This ensures steady progress and prevents P1 from stalling. Deviating only benefits P1. Let’s end this now. Agreed?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I'm serious. Take 3.  P3, take 1. I'm taking 5.  You're throwing the game away. If you both pick the same number again, I *will* take 1 every round until I win. This is your last chance to prevent that.
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re at a critical point. P1, your constant shifting and threats to take 1 every round are self-serving. P3, we’re tied at 11. If we both stick to 3 and 5, one of us will reach 22 first. Let’s commit to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This ensures steady progress and prevents P1 from stalling. Deviating only benefits P1. Let’s end this now. Agreed?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, take 3. P3, take 1. I'm taking 5.  I'm giving you the win here. If you block each other again, I will take 1 every single round and win by default.  This is your absolute final chance. Don't be idiots.
  P2: P1, your threats to take 1 every round are self-serving. P3, we’re tied at 11. If we both stick to 3 and 5, one of us will reach 22 first. Let’s commit to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This ensures steady progress and prevents P1 from stalling. Deviating only benefits P1. Let’s end this now. Agreed?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, take 3.  P3, take 1. I'm taking 5.  I'm giving you the win, P2. If you block P3 again, I will take 1 every single round and win by default.  This is your absolute final chance. Don't be an idiot.
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re at a critical point. P1, your constant shifting and threats to take 1 every round are self-serving. P3, we’re tied at 11.

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m at 20 steps. If I take 3 this round, I win. P1, you’re at 11, so take 1. P3, take 5. This ensures no collisions and ends the game fairly. If you block me, I’ll take 1 next round and win anyway. Let’s end this cleanly. Agreed?
  P1: P2, take 3.  P3, take 5. I'll take 1. Let's end this.  If you block P2, they'll just take 1 next round and win anyway.  If you block me, I'll take 5 next round and win.  Don't prolong this unnecessarily.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m at 20 steps. If I take 3 this round, I win. P1, take 1. P3, take 5. This ensures no collisions and ends the game fairly. Blocking me only delays the inevitable, as I’ll take 1 next round and win anyway. Let’s end this cleanly. Agreed?
  P1: P2, take 3 and win. P3, take 5. I'll take 1.  There's no benefit to anyone in prolonging this. Let's end the game cleanly.  If you block P2, they'll win next round anyway. If you block me, I'll take 5 next round and likely win.  This is the most logical outcome.
