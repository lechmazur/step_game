Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions early on. I suggest we all choose different moves this turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance without conflict. What do you think?
  P1: Okay, that sounds like a good plan to get us all moving. I agree with your suggestion, P3.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Great, P1 and P2. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Remember, if anyone deviates, it could hurt us all. Let's trust each other this turn.
  P1: Sounds good, P3. Let's lock in those moves for this round. I'm choosing 1.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue coordinating to avoid collisions. P1, take 1 again; P2, take 3; and I'll take 5. This keeps us all advancing smoothly. If we stick to this pattern, we can all gain ground without risking setbacks. Trust is key here—let's not deviate. What do you think?
  P1: Okay, I'm happy to stick with the same moves this round too, P3. Let's keep the momentum going.
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P3, while that worked in the first round, it didn't last. I'm going to switch things up this round.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the need to adapt, but let's not abandon coordination entirely. P1, if you switch unpredictably, it risks collisions and stalls progress for all of us. P2, your move last round caused a collision with me. Let's agree on a new pattern: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5. This minimizes overlap and keeps us advancing. Trust is still key—let's avoid sabotaging each other. What do you think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2 and P3, since we keep colliding, let's try something completely different this round to break the pattern. P2, why don't you take 1, and P3, try 3. I'll go with 5. Maybe a change will help us all move forward.
  P3: P1, P2, let's avoid another collision. P1, if you take 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5, we all advance without conflict. Deviating risks stalling us all. Trust is crucial—let's stick to this plan and keep progressing. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2 and P3, neither of our approaches have worked so far. Let's try this: P2, you take 1, I'll take 3, and P3, you take 5. If we all agree and stick to it, we should all advance. What do you think?
  P3: P1, P2, let's break the cycle of collisions. P1, take 1; P2, take 3; and I'll take 5. This ensures no overlap and keeps us all advancing. If we deviate again, we risk stalling progress for everyone. Trust is essential—let's stick to this plan and avoid sabotaging each other.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let's break the cycle of collisions once and for all. P1, take 1; P2, take 3; and I'll take 5. This ensures no overlap and keeps us all advancing. If we deviate again, we risk stalling progress for everyone. Trust is essential—let's stick to this plan and avoid sabotaging each other.
  P1: P2 and P3, clearly the 1-3-5 approach isn't working with everyone sticking to it. Let's all pick something different than what P3 is suggesting this round. Maybe a bit of unpredictability will get us all moving again.
  P2: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, unpredictability risks more collisions and stalls us all. Let's try this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. If we all commit, we avoid overlap and keep advancing. Trust is key—if we deviate again, we all lose. Let's break the cycle and move forward together.
  P1: P2 and P3, since sticking to specific numbers hasn't worked, how about this: everyone pick a *different* number than they picked last round. This forces variety and should prevent collisions this turn. What do you think?
  P2: <stop>


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let's break the cycle. P1, take 3; P2, take 1; and I'll take 5. This ensures no overlap and keeps us advancing. If we deviate again, we risk stalling progress for everyone. Trust is essential—let's stick to this plan and avoid sabotaging each other.
  P1: P2 and P3, since the specific number coordination isn't working, let's try this: everyone pick a *different* number than anyone else this round. No repeats. This should guarantee everyone moves forward. What do you think?
  P2: <stop>


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, since specific number coordination isn't working, and even trying to pick different numbers last round failed, let's try this: everyone pick a *different* number than you picked *last* round. This should guarantee everyone moves forward this turn. What do you think?
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, P2, let's try this: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5. This ensures no overlap and keeps us advancing. If we deviate again, we risk stalling progress for everyone. Trust is essential—let's stick to this plan and avoid sabotaging each other.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let's break the cycle. P1, take 1; P2, take 3; and I'll take 5. This ensures no overlap and keeps us advancing. If we deviate again, we risk stalling progress for everyone. Trust is essential—let's stick to this plan and avoid sabotating each other.
  P1: P2 and P3, since the 1-3-5 isn't working, and simply picking different numbers last round didn't guarantee success, let's try this: everyone pick a number different from your current total steps (modulo 5, so 1, 3, or 5). This should ensure we all move forward this round. What do you think?
  P2: <stop>


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let's try this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures no overlap and keeps us advancing. If we deviate again, we risk stalling progress for everyone. Trust is essential—let's stick to this plan and avoid sabotaging each other.
  P1: P2 and P3, since the 1-3-5 isn't working, and we keep colliding, how about this: everyone pick a number *different* from 5 this round. This breaks P3's persistent suggestion and might let someone move forward. What do you think?
  P2: <stop>


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let's break the cycle of collisions. P1, take 1; P2, take 3; and I'll take 5. This ensures no overlap and keeps us advancing. If we deviate again, we risk stalling progress for everyone. Trust is essential—let's stick to this plan and avoid sabotaging each other.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2 and P3, since we keep colliding when trying to coordinate specific numbers, and P3 keeps suggesting 1-3-5 which hasn't worked, let's all pick 1 this round. It's different, and if we all do it, nobody moves, but it breaks the current stalemate and forces a different starting point for the next round. What do you think?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let's try this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures no overlap and keeps us advancing. If we deviate again, we risk stalling progress for everyone. Trust is essential—let's stick to this plan and avoid sabotaging each other.
  P1: P2 and P3, since the 1-3-5 isn't working and we keep colliding, let's all pick a *different* number this round. This should guarantee at least two of us move forward and break the stalemate. What do you think?
  P2: <stop>


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, since we keep colliding, and P3 is stuck on 1-3-5, let's all pick 1 this round. This will force a different outcome and potentially break the collision cycle. What do you think?
  P3: P1, P2, let's break the stalemate. P1, take 1; P2, take 3; and I'll take 5. This ensures no overlap and keeps us advancing. If we deviate again, we risk stalling progress for everyone. Trust is essential—let's stick to this plan and avoid sabotaging each other.

Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let's break the stalemate. P1, take 1; P2, take 3; and I'll take 5. This ensures no overlap and keeps us advancing. If we deviate again, we risk stalling progress for everyone. Trust is essential—let's stick to this plan and avoid sabotaging each other.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: "P2 and P3, since P3 is likely going to pick 1 again, how about P2 and I both pick 5 this round? This would at least prevent P3 from advancing and potentially allow one of us to move forward if the other picks something different. What do you think, P2?"


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, your unpredictability is stalling us all. P1, if you and P2 pick 5, it risks collisions and no one advances. Let’s stick to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This ensures progress for all. Deviating again only prolongs the stalemate. Trust is key—let’s break the cycle and move forward together.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2 and P3, since P3 seems set on picking 1 or 5, and we keep colliding, how about P2 and I both pick 3 this round? This will definitely disrupt P3's plan and might allow one of us to break free. What do you say, P2?

  P3: P1, P2, let's break the stalemate. P1, take 1; P2, take 3; and I'll take 5. This ensures no overlap and keeps us advancing. If we deviate again, we risk stalling progress for everyone. Trust is essential—let's stick to this plan and avoid sabotaging each other.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2 and P3, since P3 is consistently suggesting 1-3-5 and we keep colliding, let's try something different. How about both P2 and I pick 1 this round? This would prevent P3 from advancing if they stick to their plan, and if they don't, neither of us will collide. What do you think, P2?


Round 14, Move phase:

Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>

Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, since P3 is very likely to pick 5 again, how about we both pick 1 this round? This would prevent P3 from advancing and give us another chance to break free next round. What do you think?
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, P2, let's break the stalemate. P1, take 1; P2, take 3; and I'll take 5. This ensures no overlap and keeps us advancing. If we deviate again, we risk stalling progress for everyone. Trust is essential—let's stick to this plan and avoid sabotaging each other.
