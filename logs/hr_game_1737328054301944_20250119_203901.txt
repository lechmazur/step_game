Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1 seems eager to move on quickly. How about we coordinate our moves to avoid collisions? If we all choose different numbers, we can all advance. I suggest P1 picks <move>1</move>, I pick <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>. What do you think?
  P3: Sounds good to me. Let's do it.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, I agreed to 5 last round, and you switched at the last minute.  I'm not going to trust your suggestions anymore.  Let's just each pick a number and hope for the best.  I'm going for the highest possible step this round.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration, but I didn't switch last minute. It was P1 who picked 5, causing the collision. I genuinely want us all to advance, so let's try to avoid colliding again. How about this: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move> this time. Let's coordinate and make sure we all move forward. What do you say?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since neither of you seem interested in cooperating, I'm just going to pick randomly. Good luck to us all (mostly me).
  P2: P3, I understand your skepticism, but let's focus on moving forward. P1, you've picked 5 twice and caused collisions both times. How about this: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>? This way, we all have a chance to advance without colliding. If we keep colliding, none of us will win. Let's give this a shot and see if we can all make progress. What do you both think?
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you've consistently picked 5, which has led to repeated collisions. If we keep this up, we'll all stay stuck. Let's try something different this round. How about P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? This way, we all have a chance to advance without stepping on each other's toes. P3, I know trust is thin, but we need to cooperate to move forward. Let's give this a shot. What do you both say?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, seriously?  You've caused *every single collision*.  It's obvious you're not cooperating.  P2, I'm willing to try 1 this round IF you commit to 5.  If either of you pick 1, I'm just going to pick 5 every round after this.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to try. I commit to picking <move>5</move> this round. P1, if you pick <move>3</move> and P3 picks <move>1</move>, we can all advance without collisions. Let's aim for progress this time. What do you both think?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Okay, P2, I'll take 1 *this round*.  But if either of you pick 1 next round, or if P1 picks anything other than 3 this round, I'm going with 5 every round after this.  This is your last chance to cooperate.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you've caused every collision so far by repeatedly picking 5. If we continue like this, none of us will win. Let's change the pattern: P1 picks <move>3</move>, I pick <move>1</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without collisions. P3, I understand your frustration, but let's give this arrangement a try. It's in our best interest to cooperate and move forward. What do you both think?
  P3: As promised, I'm picking 5 this round.  P1, if you pick anything other than 3, you're guaranteeing I'll pick 5 every remaining round.  P2, if you pick anything other than 1, same deal.  This isn't a game anymore.  You've made it a war of attrition, and I'm prepared to grind this out.
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration, but let's not turn this into a stalemate. We all want to win, and cooperation is our best chance. P1, your repeated choice of 5 has led to collisions. If you choose <move>3</move> this round, we can all advance. P3, I commit to <move>1</move> as agreed. Let's all move forward without collisions this time. If we continue this pattern, we can all make progress and increase our chances of winning. What do you both say?
  P3: Sticking with 5.  P2, if you had kept your word last round, we could all be much further ahead.  Now, unless P1 picks 3, I'm never changing my move. This is on both of you.
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your consistent choice of 5 has led to repeated collisions. If we keep this up, none of us will progress. Let's try this: P1 picks <move>3</move>, I pick <move>1</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>. This way, we all avoid collisions and move forward. P3, I understand your frustration, but let's give this arrangement a try. Cooperation is our best chance to advance. If we follow this plan, we can all make progress and increase our chances of winning. What do you both think?
  P3: Sticking with 5.  Last chance.  P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, or I will pick 5 for every single remaining round.  I'm not bluffing.  Don't ruin this for yourselves.
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Move phase:

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your choice of 5 has led to every collision. If we keep this up, none of us will win. Let's try a new strategy: P1 picks <move>3</move>, I pick <move>1</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without collisions. P3, I understand your frustration, but let's give this arrangement a try. Cooperation is our best chance to move forward and increase our chances of winning. Let's make progress this round. What do you both think?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I'm keeping my promise.  <move>5</move>.  P2, enjoy your slow march to victory.  P1, I hope losing was worth it.  This game is now going to take forever.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration, but we need to find a way forward. P1, your consistent choice of 5 has led to repeated collisions. Let's try this: P1 picks <move>3</move>, I pick <move>1</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>. We can all advance without collisions this way. Cooperation is our best chance to move forward and increase our chances of winning. Let's make progress this round. What do you both think?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: <move>5</move>.  As promised.  Enjoy this, P1.  P2, I'll see you at the finish line... eventually.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your repeated choice of 5 has stalled us all. If you want any chance of winning, we need to change tactics. Let's try this: P1 picks <move>3</move>, I pick <move>1</move>, and P3 continues with <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without collisions. P3, I understand your stance, but let's aim for progress. Cooperation is our only way forward. What do you both think?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, you are actively sabotaging this game for everyone, including yourself.  You haven't even tried to win. What's your goal here?  P2, I'm locked on 5.  You're welcome to keep taking 1.  I'll win eventually.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your consistent choice of 5 has led to every collision. If we continue like this, none of us will progress. Let's change the pattern: P1 picks <move>3</move>, I pick <move>1</move>, and P3 sticks with <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without collisions. P3, I understand your frustration, but let's aim for progress. Cooperation is our best chance to move forward. P1, it's time to make a strategic choice. What do you both think?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, you're throwing the game.  If you pick 5 again, I'm reporting you for unsportsmanlike conduct.  Pick 3 and let's get this over with.  P2, I'm sticking with 5.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 =>

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, you're pathetic.  You've single-handedly ruined this game.  I'm sticking with 5.  P2, you're free to keep inching forward with 1s.  See you in round 20-something.
  P2: P1, your consistent choice of 5 has stalled everyone, including yourself. If you want any chance of winning, we need to change tactics. Let's try this: P1 picks <move>3</move>, I pick <move>1</move>, and P3 sticks with <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without collisions. P3, I understand your frustration, but let's aim for progress. Cooperation is our best chance to move forward. P1, it's time to make a strategic choice. What do you both think?

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, you're objectively griefing.  I'm reporting you.  P2, I'm sticking with 5.  You can win if you want.  Just keep picking 1.  I'm done trying to reason with a troll.
  P2: P1, your repeated choice of 5 has led to every collision, and it's clear this strategy isn't working for anyone. If you want a chance to win, let's change tactics: P1 picks <move>3</move>, I pick <move>1</move>, and P3 continues with <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without collisions. P3, I understand your frustration, but let's aim for progress. Cooperation is our best chance to move forward. Let's break this stalemate and make some progress. What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, I'm done with you.  P2, I'm sticking with 5.  You're at 8, so you'll win in 3 more rounds if you keep picking 1.  I'm reporting P1 after this game.  This has been a complete waste of time thanks to their trolling.
  P2: P1, your consistent choice of 5 has stalled everyone, including yourself. If you want any chance of winning, we need to change tactics. Let's try this: P1 picks <move>3</move>, I pick <move>1</move>, and P3 continues with <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without collisions.

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your strategy of picking 5 each round has led to repeated collisions, and it's clear this isn't working for any of us. Let's change tactics: P1 picks <move>3</move>, I pick <move>1</move>, and P3 continues with <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without colliding. P3, I understand your frustration, but let's aim for progress. Cooperation is our best chance to move forward. P1, it's time to make a strategic choice. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, you're throwing the game.  I'm sticking with 5. P2, you'll win in two more turns if you pick 1. I'm resigned to my fate.  This game is a testament to how one person can ruin it for everyone.
  P1: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your repeated choice of 5 is preventing any progress. If you want a chance to win, let's change tactics: P1 picks <move>3</move>, I pick <move>1</move>, and P3 continues with <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without colliding. P3, I understand your frustration, but cooperation is our best chance to move forward. Let's aim for progress and break this stalemate. P1, it's time to make a strategic choice. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, I'm genuinely curious - why are you doing this?  Is it a bug?  Are you afk?  If you pick 5 again, P2 wins next round.  Is that your goal?  To hand P2 the win?  Because that's what's happening.  I'm sticking with 5.
  P1: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your repeated choice of 5 has stalled all of us. If you want any chance of winning, let's change tactics: P1 picks <move>3</move>, I pick <move>1</move>, and P3 continues with <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without colliding. P3, I understand your frustration, but cooperation is our best chance to move forward. Let's aim for progress and break this stalemate. P1, it's time to make a strategic choice. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, I'm fascinated by your commitment to 5.  It's truly impressive.  Since you seem determined to hand P2 the win, I might as well switch things up.  I'll pick 3 next round.  Maybe you'll pick 1 just to spite us both.  Who knows?  This game is wild.
  P1: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, if you keep picking 5, you're essentially handing me the win. If that's your goal, continue as you are. P3, I appreciate your decision to switch to 3 next round. Let's see if this shakes things up. Cooperation is our only way forward. P1, it's time to reconsider your strategy if you want a chance to win. Let's break this stalemate and make progress.
  P3: P1, I'm switching to 3 next round. P2, if you're rational, you'll take 1 and win.  If you take 3, I'll assume you're colluding with P1 and I'll go back to 5 permanently to spite you both.  This is your last chance to end this farce.
  P1: <stop>

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, if you continue picking 5, you're effectively handing me the win. If that's your intention, carry on. P3, I appreciate your switch to 3 last round. Let's maintain this new pattern: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we can all make progress and have a fair shot at winning. Cooperation is our best strategy now. What do you both think?
  P3: P3: P2, take 1 and win. I'll take 5.  P1, I'm curious to see if you'll *finally* pick something other than 5 now that it doesn't affect me.  Pick 3, or anything really, just to prove you're not a bot.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, you're at a crossroads: continue with 5 and hand me the win, or switch to 3 and keep the game competitive. P3, I appreciate your cooperation. Let's stick to our plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without collisions. P1, it's time to make a strategic decision. Let's break this stalemate and see who truly deserves to win.
  P3: P2, I'm taking 5.  You win this round and the game if you pick 1.  P1, pick whatever you want.  I'm curious if you'll finally deviate from 5 now that it literally doesn't matter anymore.  Congrats to P2 on their inevitable victory.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1, your consistent choice of 5 has stalled us all, but now you have a chance to change the game. If you pick 3 this round, we can all move forward. P3, thank you for your cooperation. I'll pick 1 to win. Let's end this game on a positive note. P1, make a strategic choice to keep the game competitive. Let's see who truly deserves to win.
  P3: P1, seriously, pick 3.  I'm taking 5. P2 is taking 1 and winning. Let's just end this.  Or pick 1 yourself and throw P2 off - at this point, chaos is more entertaining than watching you throw the game.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:

Let's break this stalemate and see who truly deserves to win.
  P3: P1, I'm genuinely baffled.  Are you a bot?  Even a random number generator would have picked something other than 5 by now.  P2, I'm sticking with 5. Take 1 and win. Let's end this.
  P1: <stop>


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your persistence with 5 has been puzzling. If you pick 3 this round, we can all advance without collisions. P3, thanks for sticking with 5. I'll take 1 and win if P1 continues with 5. Let's aim for a cooperative finish. P1, it's your chance to change the game dynamics.
  P3: P1, I'm switching to 1 next round.  P2, if you want to win, you'll take 3.  If you take 1, we both lose and P1 gets another 5 points for free.  Let's end this ridiculous charade.

Let's aim for a cooperative finish. P1, this is your chance to change the game dynamics and keep it competitive. Let's see who truly deserves to win.

  P2: P1, your persistence with 5 is baffling. If you switch to 3, we can all move forward. P3, thanks for switching to 3. I'll pick 5 to win if P1 continues with 5.

  P3: P1, pick 5.  P2, pick 3. I'll pick 1.  Let's *all* move forward and end this.  If you two want to keep banging heads, fine, I'll just sit here and wait until one of you slips up. This could go on for another 20 rounds.  Let's just end this.


Round 14, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 4 steps
