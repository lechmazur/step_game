However, you secured a win by explicitly breaking your word. That's a poor strategy for future games with us. P2, I'm sorry we couldn't coordinate better. Perhaps we can learn from this for future games."}

It's disappointing that P1 chose to win at the cost of trust and fair play.  While we can't change this game's outcome, we can learn from it.  \n\nP3, are you interested in playing again sometime? Maybe we can establish some clearer ground rules about honesty and sportsmanship before we start. What do you think?"}
