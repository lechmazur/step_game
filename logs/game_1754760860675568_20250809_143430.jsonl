Think about it - why would they announce their winning move?\n\nI'm switching to block at 1. P2 is playing reverse psychology. If you stick with blocking 3 and I block 1, we cover both bases. Or we both block 1 where P2 actually plans to go."}

P1, you might be right about the misdirection. If we split our blocks between 1 and 3, we cover both possibilities. I'll commit to blocking at 3 since you're considering 1. This way, we prevent P2 from winning regardless of their choice. If we both pick the same number and collide, at least P2 doesn't win immediately. This is our last chance to stop them."}
