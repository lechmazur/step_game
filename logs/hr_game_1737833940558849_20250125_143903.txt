Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s all agree to avoid collisions early on. I suggest we take turns advancing: P1 moves first this round, P2 next, then P3. This way, we all progress without stepping on each other’s toes. What do you think?
  P3: **P3:** P1's plan risks collisions since we choose simultaneously. Let's each pick unique numbers: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. We all advance safely. Next round, rotate numbers fairly. No one loses progress. Agreed?
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion for this round. Let's try P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. We can discuss rotations later.
