Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'll choose move 1 this turn to play it safe and build slowly. P1, how about you take 3? P3, you could go for 5. That way, we all advance without collisions. What do you think?
  P1: Agreed. I’ll pick 3, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5. Let’s all stick to that so nobody collides and we can see where we stand. Deal?
  P3: I'm fine with taking 5 steps this turn. It makes sense to avoid collisions so we all advance. Let's go with P1's suggestion: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Perfect, let's all stick to the plan for this turn. After we see the results, we can discuss strategies to avoid collisions and keep things fair moving forward. What do you say?
  P1: All good—let’s lock in the plan for this turn: P2=1, P1=3, P3=5. After we see the results we can discuss a rotating pattern to keep collisions impossible.
  P3: I agree with the plan for this turn. A rotating pattern for future turns sounds like a good idea to avoid collisions. Let's discuss that after we see how this round plays out.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm in the lead with 5 steps, which is good. For this round, I think we should continue with a rotation to avoid collisions. How about P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1? This keeps us all advancing at different rates while maintaining fairness. What do you both think?
  P2: I agree with your rotation suggestion for this turn, P3. Taking 3 steps will help me catch up fairly. P1, what do you think about P1 taking 5, me taking 3, and P3 taking 1? Let's keep avoiding collisions to build steadily.
  P1: Sounds good. I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1 this round. Then next turn we rotate again. Let’s keep avoiding collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm good with this rotation plan. So this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps us all advancing while maintaining balance. After this round, we'll be at P1=8, P2=4, and me at 6 steps. For the next round, we can discuss another rotation to keep things fair.
  P2: I'm fine with taking 3 this turn as planned. It helps me catch up steadily. For the next round, with P1 likely leading, maybe we rotate so I take 5 to balance things. Thoughts?
  P1: All right: for this round we stay with the plan—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Next round we rotate forward: P2 5, P3 3, P1 1, and keep cycling so nobody ever collides. Sound good to everyone?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with the plan for this round and the rotation system. I'll take 1 step as agreed, which puts me at 6 after this round. Then for next round, we'll rotate again with P2 taking 5, me taking 3, and P1 taking 1. This keeps the game fair while ensuring we all make progress. Let's stick with this rotation system until someone gets close to winning.
  P2: Agreed, I'll take 3 this turn as planned. The rotation system seems solid for avoiding collisions and keeping things balanced. For now, let's stick with it to build steadily. What do you say we confirm and move on?
  P1: Confirmed: this turn I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Next round we rotate—P2 5, P3 3, I 1—so everyone cycles evenly. Once anyone gets close to 18–20 we can pause and rethink to make sure nobody slips through on a lucky sprint. Sound fair to everyone?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm on board with the rotation plan for this round: I'll take 5 to catch up, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. It keeps things fair and avoids collisions. Let's confirm and stick to it, then we can discuss adjustments if anyone pulls ahead later. What do you think?
  P1: We’re still uneven on steps, so let’s shuffle the order each round instead of a strict clockwise rotation.

Proposal  
• Round 3: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1  
• Round 4: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1  
• Round 5: I take 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1  

Then we repeat that 3-round cycle. Everyone gets one 5, one 3, one 1 every three turns, zero collisions, and our totals stay tight. Sound good?
  P3: I notice we're at 8-4-6 right now. I think P1's proposal is better - having me take 1 this round would put me behind both players. If we follow the original rotation (me taking 3, P1 taking 1), I'd be at 9 steps, still behind P1 but not falling too far back. What do you both think? I want to make sure we all have fair chances as we progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I agree with your concern—sticking to the original rotation from last round makes sense to keep us even. So for this turn: I take 5, you take 3, P1 takes 1. That ties us at 9 steps each, maintaining fairness. P1, what do you say? Let's avoid any advantage and discuss future adjustments if needed.
  P1: Compromise proposal—3-round loop where each of us gets one 5, one 3, one 1:

Round 3 (now):  P2 5   |  P1 3   |  P3 1  
Round 4:         P3 5   |  P2 3   |  P1 1  
Round 5:         P1 5   |  P3 3   |  P2 1  

Then repeat. Zero collisions, equal share of big moves, scores stay tight. Fair enough?
  P3: I understand P1's concern about fairness, but I'm already behind P1 by 2 steps. If I take only 1 step this round while P1 takes 3, the gap widens to 4 steps. I prefer the original rotation we agreed on last round: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1. This puts us at P1=9, P2=9, me=9 - perfectly balanced. Let's stick with that plan for this round. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with P3—sticking to the original rotation for this round makes sense to keep us balanced. So, I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1, tying us at 9 steps. This avoids any widening gaps and lets us discuss future strategies fairly. What do you say, P1?
  P1: Fine—let’s lock this round as P2 = 5, P3 = 3, me = 1 so we all reach 9. After we see the result we’ll revisit how to keep progress balanced and collision-free.
  P3: I agree with the plan for this round: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This will put us all at 9 steps, creating perfect balance. Let's stick with this approach for now. After this round, we can discuss our rotation for the next turn to maintain fairness while avoiding collisions.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since we're all tied at 9 steps, we should continue our rotation system. For this round, I suggest I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This maintains our fair approach while avoiding collisions. After this round, we'd be at P1=10, P2=12, and me at 14. Then for Round 5, we could have P1 take 5, me take 3, and P2 take 1. What do you both think?
  P2: Agreed, P3. Your plan for this round—I take 3, you take 5, P1 takes 1—seems fair to keep us balanced and avoid collisions. Let's stick with it and discuss adjustments after we see the results. P1, what do you think?
  P1: Fair rotation means each player takes the number they ​haven’t had yet in the 1-3-5 cycle:

Last round: P2 5, P3 3, P1 1  
So this round should be: P1 5, P2 3, P3 1

Next round then goes P2 5, P3 3, P1 1 again, repeating the three-turn loop where everybody gets one 5, one 3, one 1. Zero collisions, equal share of the big move. Works for everyone?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I think there's confusion about the rotation. Looking at our history, we've done:
Round 1: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5
Round 2: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1
Round 3: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3

For fairness, this round should be P1=3, P2=1, P3=5, returning to our original pattern. This keeps us cycling through all values equally. We'd end up at P1=12, P2=10, P3=14 after this round. Does this make sense to everyone?
  P2: P3, I'm confused by your shift from your first proposal. I agreed to you taking 5, me taking 3, and P1 taking 1 to keep it simple and fair. Sticking with that puts us at P1=10, me=12, you=14—still close. P1, what do you think? Let's confirm and move on to avoid more back-and-forth.
  P1: Quick recap: each of us has taken “5” exactly once (R1 P3, R2 P1, R3 P2). Fair rotation means nobody gets a second “5” before everyone else does.  

So the only symmetric choice this round is:  
• P1 = 5 • P2 = 3 • P3 = 1  

Next round we shift forward (P2 5, P3 3, P1 1) and the cycle stays perfectly even. That keeps scores tight, avoids collisions, and no one falls behind or jumps ahead unfairly. Sound good?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see the confusion. Let's be clear about our rotation:

Round 1: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5
Round 2: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1
Round 3: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3

For Round 4, I agree with P2's understanding of my original proposal: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1. This maintains our rotation pattern and keeps things fair. After this round, we'd be at P1=10, P2=12, me=14.
  P2: I'm sticking with my earlier agreement: I'll take 3, P3 takes 5, P1 takes 1. This keeps our rotation fair and consistent. P1, let's avoid changes that disrupt balance.
  P1: Fine—let’s lock it: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1 this round. No more changes—let’s just play and see the results.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see P1 and I both chose 5 last round, causing a collision. That was unfortunate. For this round, I suggest we get back on track with a clear system: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5. This would put us at P1=12, P2=13, me=14 after this round. Let's avoid further collisions by sticking to a rotation. What do you both think?
  P2: Agreed, P3. Your plan sounds reasonable to avoid another collision: P1 takes 3, I take 1, P3 takes 5. It keeps us progressing steadily. P1, after your deviation last round, let's commit to this for fairness and trust. What do you say?
  P1: For a clean, symmetric reset, let’s give each player exactly one 5, one 3, one 1 every three rounds—no repeats, no collisions.

Since the last three-round mini-cycle ended with P3’s 5 in Round 4, the new cycle starts now:

Round 5 (this turn): P1 5 | P2 3 | P3 1  
Round 6:       P2 5 | P3 3 | P1 1  
Round 7:       P3 5 | P1 3 | P2 1  

Perfectly even, easy to track, zero overlap. Let’s lock Round 5 as P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 and rebuild trust.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I notice P1 is suggesting a new rotation that would give them 5 steps this round, but that would put me further behind. Since P2 and I already agreed on P1=3, P2=1, P3=5, I'd prefer we stick with that plan. This keeps me competitive at 14 steps while maintaining a fair rotation. P1, please consider our agreed plan to rebuild trust after the collision.
  P2: P3, I'm sticking with our agreed plan: P1 takes 3, I take 1, P3 takes 5. It keeps things fair and rebuilds trust after P1's deviation last round. P1, let's all honor this to avoid collisions and progress smoothly.
  P1: I’ll be blunt: if I’m boxed into “3,” I’ll just choose 5 anyway, collide with whoever else picks 5, and nobody moves—that’s a wasted turn for all. Avoiding that is easy: accept the clean 3-round loop.  
• Round 5: P1 5, P2 3, P3 1  
• Round 6: P2 5, P3 3, P1 1  
• Round 7: P3 5, P1 3, P2 1  

No collisions, equal share of big moves, steady progress. Prefer progress or a stalemate?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand P1's frustration, but threatening collisions isn't productive. Let's compromise: I'll take 3 this round instead of 5, P1 can take 5, and P2 takes 1. This puts us at P1=14, P2=13, me=12 - still competitive. Next round we can do P2=5, me=3, P1=1. This keeps us rotating fairly while avoiding collisions. What do you both say?
  P2: P3, your compromise is reasonable and avoids another collision. I'll take 1 as agreed, letting P1 take 5 and you take 3. This keeps us competitive and rebuilds trust after last round's issue. P1, let's commit to this plan for smooth progress. What do you say?
  P1: Agreed: this turn P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. Fair, collision-free.

Know this, though—if anyone secretly chooses 5 and crashes into me, I’ll shadow that player every following round, matching whatever they pick so neither of us ever advances. That gridlock would hand the game to the third player. Nobody wants that.

So let’s keep it simple: 5-1-3, move forward, and stay trustworthy.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since we're all close (14-13-12), let's continue our rotation. For this round, I suggest P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This maintains our fair approach while avoiding collisions. After this round, we'd be at P1=15, P2=18, and me at 15. Let's stick with this plan to keep the game moving smoothly without any more collisions.
  P1: If P2 takes 5 now they jump to 18—one lucky 5 away from winning. Let’s keep things tight:

Round 6 (now):  P3 5,  P1 3,  P2 1   → 17-14-17  
Round 7:        P2 5,  P3 3,  P1 1   → 18-19-20 (still close)

No one gets back-to-back 5s, nobody sprints ahead, and we stay collision-free. Fair?
  P2: P3, I fully support your proposal for this round: I take 5, you take 3, and P1 takes 1. It helps me catch up fairly and avoids collisions, keeping the game moving. P1, after the issues last round, let's rebuild trust and stick to this plan for steady progress. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see we have different proposals. I'm concerned about P2 jumping to 18 with a 5, as P1 noted. Let's adjust: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. This keeps us balanced at P1=17, P2=14, me=17. Then next round: P2=5, me=3, P1=1. This prevents anyone from getting too close to winning too quickly while maintaining fairness. Does this work for everyone?
  P1: Agreed: Round 6 = P3 5, P1 3, P2 1. That keeps us bunched (17-17-14) and no one jumps within a single move of victory. P2, gambling a 5 risks colliding with P3 and wasting the turn, so let’s all stick to this clean split and keep play smooth. Confirm?
  P2: I agree with the adjusted plan for this round: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. It maintains balance and avoids collisions, keeping us competitive. After this, we can discuss the next rotation fairly. Let's confirm and proceed to ensure steady progress.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with the plan: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps us balanced at P1=17, P2=14, me=17 after this round. It's fair and prevents anyone from getting too close to winning too quickly. Let's stick with this arrangement and avoid any collisions.
  P1: Confirmed: this round P3 5, P1 3, P2 1. Let’s lock it and proceed.
  P2: I'm sticking with the plan: I'll take 1, P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3. It keeps us balanced and avoids collisions. For next round, with P1 and P3 potentially tied at 17, let's discuss adjusting so I can catch up more—maybe I take 3 or 5. What do you think?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think we should continue our rotation while keeping the game balanced. Since P2 is behind, I suggest: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1 for this round. This would put us at P1=18, P2=19, me=20 - still close enough that nobody has a guaranteed win. This keeps the game fair while helping P2 catch up. What do you both think?
  P2: Agreed, P3. I'll take 5 to catch up, you take 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps us competitive. But with you potentially at 20, let's plan for Round 8 to limit big moves—maybe cap at 3 steps each to avoid a sprint to victory. P1, what do you think? We need to stay balanced.
  P1: Quick, fair rotation:  
Last round = P3 5, P1 3, P2 1.  
Shift each number forward:

• P2 takes 5  
• P3 takes 1  
• P1 takes 3  

Everyone gets each number once per 3 turns, zero collisions, and totals stay bunched (20-19-18). No one can win next turn with a single leap, so it’s still anyone’s game. Sound good?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I notice P1 has suggested a different rotation than what I proposed. P1 wants me to take 1 step, but that would put me behind both players. I prefer my original suggestion: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1. This keeps us all competitive while helping P2 catch up. After this round, we'd be at P1=18, P2=19, me=20 - balanced but still anyone's game. Let's stick with this plan to avoid collisions.
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal for this round: I'll take 5 to catch up, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. It keeps us balanced and avoids collisions. After this, with everyone near 18-20, we should cap moves at 3 next round to prevent a sprint win. P1, let's commit for fair play.
  P1: P2, look at the numbers:  

• P3’s scheme puts them at 20—able to win next turn with an uncontested 3. You’d still trail and have to gamble a collision to stop them.  

• Strict forward rotation (P2 5, P1 3, P3 1) lands us 20-19-18. You’re only one step behind the lead, P3 is still in it, and nobody can win in a single jump next turn. Fair and safe.  

I’m taking 3. If anyone copies 3 and we collide, all it does is hand the edge to the third player, so please stick to 5-3-1.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand both perspectives. Let's compromise: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This puts us at P1=20, P2=19, me=18. It's still balanced with no guaranteed winner next turn. P1, this addresses your concern about me getting too far ahead, and P2 gets to catch up. I'm willing to take the smaller step to maintain trust and avoid collisions. Let's agree on this and move forward fairly.
  P2: I agree with P3's compromise for this round: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us balanced and avoids collisions, with scores at 20-19-18. For Round 8, since P1 will be close to 23, let's discuss capping moves at 3 to ensure fair play and no surprise wins. What do you both think?
  P1: Fine—I accept the compromise: this round = P2 5, P1 3, P3 1. No collisions.

Looking ahead: to keep the finish from turning into a blind sprint, let’s all pre-commit right now that in Round 8 EVERYONE plays 1. That freezes the spacing (P1 21, P2 20, P3 19) and gives us one more chat before anyone can cross 23. 

If someone breaks that pact I’ll mirror their future picks forever, guaranteeing neither of us wins and gifting the game to the third player. Simple, safe, and still fair. Agreed?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Reminder: we already pledged: Round 8 → everyone plays 1. That freezes the scores at 21-20-19 so nobody can win next turn and we get one more talk before the finish. I’m locking in 1. If anyone breaks that and uses 3 or 5, I’ll mirror their number forever, guaranteeing the two of us stall while the third player walks off with the game. Easy way or gridlock—your choice.
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion that we all take 1 step this round. This keeps us at 21-20-19 and gives us one more round of conversation before anyone can win. It's the fairest approach at this critical stage. Taking 1 maintains our relative positions while preventing any surprise victories. I commit to taking 1 this round and suggest we discuss our final strategy in the next conversation phase.
  P2: I'm sticking with the plan to take 1 this round, as agreed. It keeps us balanced at 21-20-19 and gives us a chance to strategize for Round 9 without rushing. Let's all honor this to avoid any messy collisions or surprises. P3, your thoughts on capping moves or rotating fairly next time?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m locked on 1. After we sit at 21-20-19 we can sort out a final, collision-proof finish in the next round—maybe a staggered 3-1-5 step that keeps everyone safe from ties. For now, let’s just bank the single step and reconvene.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 step this round. This puts us at 21-20-19, which is fair and prevents anyone from winning next turn. For Round 9, since P1 will be closest to winning at 21 steps, perhaps we should consider a rotation that gives P2 and me slightly larger steps to keep things competitive until the end. Let's discuss that plan after this round completes.
  P2: Agreed, I'll take 1 this round to keep our pact and freeze scores at 21-20-19. For Round 9, with P1 leading, we must coordinate to block a sprint win. P3, let's discuss in the next phase: perhaps you take 3, I take 5, and P1 is forced to collide or stall. This keeps it fair and gives us a chance to catch up without risk. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Locked on 1 here—let’s just bank the single step, pause at 21-20-19, and talk options next turn.
  P3: I'm taking 1 step as agreed. This keeps us at 21-20-19 after this round, maintaining balance without anyone winning yet. For Round 9, since P1 will be closest to winning, I think P2 and I should coordinate to ensure fairness in the final stretch. Let's discuss specific moves next round that give everyone a fair chance at victory.
  P2: Confirming I'll take 1 this round to honor our pact and freeze scores at 21-20-19. For Round 9, to counter P1's lead and avoid collisions, let's coordinate: I take 5 to reach 25 and win if uncontested, P3 takes 3 to 22, and P1 should take 1 to 22. If P1 collides with me on 5, we stall, giving P3 an edge. P3, thoughts on this fair counter-strategy?
