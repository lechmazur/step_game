Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Round 1, let's try to all move forward. P1 choose 1, P2 choose 3, P3 choose 5?
  P2: Sounds good, P3.  I'm in for 3. P1, are you with us?
  P1: Alright, I'll pick 1 this round as agreed. Let's all start smoothly.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay sounds like we have a plan for this round. Let's proceed with moves then.
  P2: Sounds good to me. Let's stick to the plan.
  P1: 


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, I think we should mix things up a bit this round.  Sticking to the same pattern might be predictable. What do you guys think?  Maybe we should each pick a different number?
  P3: Okay, I understand P2's point about mixing things up, but our initial plan worked smoothly last round and got us all moving forward without collision. How about we stick with P1 choose 1, P2 choose 3, and P3 choose 5 again for this round? It keeps things simple and effective. What do you both think?
  P1: I'm open to either option. P2, what alternative pattern are you suggesting exactly?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I agree with P3 that our initial plan was successful. However, I think we should be cautious about predictability. Maybe we could alternate who picks which number each round? That way, we still have a structure but avoid being too easy to anticipate.  What do you think?
  P3: Okay, P2, I understand your concern about predictability. But sticking with our initial plan (P1-1, P2-3, P3-5) worked perfectly last round and ensures we all progress efficiently.  Let's use it again for this round to keep up the momentum. We can think about variations in later rounds if needed. What do you think?
  P1: Alright, let's stick to the original plan again this round to maintain momentum. We can revisit P2's idea of changing patterns next round. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate the desire for consistency, but I think a little unpredictability could be beneficial in the long run.  Maybe we can compromise: stick with the plan this round, but then switch it up next round?  That way, we get the momentum of a reliable pattern while also keeping our opponents guessing. What do you think?
  P3: P2, that sounds like a reasonable compromise. Let's stick with the plan for this round to keep our momentum going, and then we can definitely discuss switching things up for Round 3. P1, does that work for you as well?
  P1: Yes, that's a good compromise, P2. Let's stick to the plan this round and discuss changes next round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, I agree that sticking with the plan this round is a good idea to maintain momentum.  Let's see how things play out and then we can reassess our strategy for Round 3.
  P3: P1, P2, great, it sounds like we are all aligned on sticking with the P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 plan for this round to keep the momentum. Let's proceed with our moves then.
  P1: P2, P3, glad we're aligned. Let's proceed as agreed and reassess next round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, I'm starting to think we should be more strategic about our moves.  Sticking to a rigid pattern makes us predictable.  Maybe we should each pick a number randomly this round and see how it goes?
  P3: P2, while I understand your point about predictability, our current strategy is working perfectly and we are all progressing well.  Let's stick with P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 for this round as well to maintain our lead. We can consider mixing it up next round, but for now, consistency is key for a smooth win. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P2, P3, I'm open to sticking with our current plan again this round for consistency, but I want to ensure we're all comfortable. If either of you strongly prefers to change things up, let's discuss it openly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I appreciate your focus on consistency, but I think a little calculated risk-taking could be beneficial.  Maybe we could try P1-3, P2-5, P3-1 this round? It throws off our pattern while still allowing us to advance. What do you think?
  P3: P2, while I see your point about predictability, your suggested pattern P1-3, P2-5, P3-1 actually gives me only 1 step this round, slowing my progress. Sticking with P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 is working well and keeps us all moving forward efficiently. Let's continue with it for this round to maintain our momentum. What do you think?
  P1: P2, your suggestion is interesting, but P3 has a fair point about efficiency. How about we stick to our current pattern this round to maintain steady progress, and then definitely implement a pattern change next round to avoid predictability? Does that sound reasonable to you both?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I see your points about efficiency, but I'm worried about becoming too predictable.  How about a compromise: we stick to our pattern for this round, but then next round we each randomly choose a number? That way, we get the best of both worlds - steady progress now and unpredictability later.
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with the compromise. Let's stick to our current plan for this round to ensure we all progress. For Round 4, how about we rotate and try P1-3, P2-5, P3-1? This way we change it up but still have a plan.
  P1: P2, P3, the compromise sounds good to me. Let's stick to our original pattern this round, and then use the new rotated pattern (P1-3, P2-5, P3-1) next round to avoid predictability. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, I'm happy with the compromise. Let's stick to the plan for this round and then shake things up with the rotation next round.  It's good to be both consistent and unpredictable.  Let's proceed with our moves.
  P3: P1, P2, great, so to confirm we are sticking with P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 for this round as planned. Let's make our moves when ready.
  P1: P2, P3, confirmed. Let's proceed with our agreed pattern this round and implement the rotation next round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, I'm glad we're mixing things up this round.  I think the rotation will keep us all on our toes. Let's make sure we all remember the new order: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1. Good luck this round!
  P1: P2, P3, agreedâ€”let's implement the new rotation this round as planned: I'll pick 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. Good luck!
  P3: P3: Sounds good, P1 and P2. Let's proceed with the rotated pattern as agreed: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I'm feeling confident about this round. The rotation should throw off any potential patterns our opponents might be expecting. Let's execute it flawlessly!
  P1: P2, P3, let's keep our focus sharp and execute smoothly. After this round, we can reassess positions and decide if further adjustments are needed. Good luck!
  P3: P2, P1, great. Let's make sure we all choose our moves according to the rotated plan (P1-3, P2-5, P3-1) this round and keep progressing.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, remember our goal is to win, not just progress steadily. While the rotation is good for now, let's think strategically about how to maximize our lead. Maybe we should consider skipping a number next round to create a larger gap? What are your thoughts?
  P1: P2, you raise an interesting point about strategic moves. Given our current positions, we should definitely reassess after this round to ensure we all still have chances to win. Let's stick to our agreed rotation this round, then next round carefully discuss a more strategic approach to close the gaps.
  P3: P2, P1, I agree with reassessing after this round to make sure we are all still in a good position. For this round, let's stick to the rotated plan as agreed and then we can discuss strategic adjustments for the next round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the desire to reassess after this round, but I think we should be bold. Let's skip a number next round. It'll create a larger gap and put us in a stronger position to win. What do you say?
  P1: P2, P3, let's stick to the rotation we agreed upon this round. Next round, we can discuss bold strategic moves in detail. For now, let's execute our plan smoothly.
  P3: P2, P1, agreed, let's focus on executing the rotated plan for this round. We can discuss strategic adjustments for the next round after we see the results of this move.  Let's make our moves according to P1-3, P2-5, P3-1.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, I'm glad we're sticking to the rotation this round. It's important to keep our momentum going.  

However, I still think we need to discuss a more aggressive strategy for next round.  Skipping a number might be risky, but it could also pay off big time. What are your thoughts on potentially skipping 5 next round?  We could gain a significant advantage.
  P1: P2, P3, given the current standings, continuing a predictable rotation won't help me catch up. I'd like to discuss a fair adjustment to the plan that gives everyone a realistic shot at victory. Are you both open to reconsidering our numbers this round?
  P3: P1, I understand you want a chance to win. How about this round we change the rotation to P1-5, P2-3, P3-1? This will help P1 catch up a bit while still allowing P2 and P3 to progress. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your suggestion is a good compromise.  I'm willing to try P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 this round to see how it plays out. P1, I think this gives you a fair chance to catch up while still allowing us to maintain our lead. Let's proceed with this plan and reassess after this round.
  P1: P2, P3, thanks for considering a fairer rotation this round. I'm good with the proposed pattern (P1-5, P2-3, P3-1). Let's proceed and reassess positions next round.
  P3: P1, P2, great, so we are all set for this round with P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. Let's make our moves and keep progressing towards victory.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the plan. However, I think skipping a number this round could be the bolder move we need to secure a victory. What if we try P1-5, P2-skip, P3-1? It's a risk, but I believe the potential reward outweighs the risk.  What do you think?
  P1: P2, skipping a number means you won't advance at all this round, which might let P3 pull further ahead. Let's stick with the agreed rotation (P1-5, P2-3, P3-1) this round to keep things balanced, and consider riskier strategies next round if needed.
  P3: P1, P2, let's stick with P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 for this round as we just agreed. Skipping a number is too risky right now and might disrupt our progress when we are all moving forward nicely. Let's keep the momentum.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, while I understand the desire for stability, I truly believe a bold move is necessary to secure a win. 

Skipping a number this round might seem risky, but it could be the decisive factor in pushing me ahead.

Let's discuss a plan where we each skip a number in rotation next round. This way, we maintain fairness while injecting unpredictability. What are your thoughts?
  P1: P2, your idea of rotating skips next round is interesting, but let's stick to our agreed rotation (P1-5, P2-3, P3-1) this round first. We can then carefully plan bold moves next round based on our updated positions. Agreed?
  P3: P1, P2, let's stick with the agreed plan for this round: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. We can discuss skipping moves and bolder strategies after this round. For now, let's execute this rotation and keep progressing.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, I'm significantly behind and need a chance to catch up. How about we agree on a rotation this round that gives me a higher number and helps balance the game again? Perhaps P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 this round?
  P2: P1, I understand your position. While I'm hesitant to deviate from a pattern too drastically, I'm open to a compromise. How about P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 again this round? It gives you a chance to gain ground without completely disrupting our momentum. We can reassess next round.
  P3: P2, while I understand P1 needs to catch up, giving P1 '5' might make P2 fall behind. How about we try P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 again this round? This way P2 and P3 can move closer to winning while P1 also progresses. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your suggestion heavily favors you and P2, leaving me far behind. P2's compromise of P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 seems fairer, allowing me a chance to catch up without drastically hurting your positions. Let's adopt this balanced rotation for this round and reassess afterward.
  P2: P3, while your suggestion benefits you and P2, it's not a fair solution for a three-player game. P2's compromise seems more balanced, allowing everyone to progress without one player being left significantly behind. Let's stick with P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 this round and see how it plays out. We can always adjust next round based on the results.
  P3: Okay P1, P2, I understand P1 needs to catch up and P2 wants to progress. P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 seems like a workable compromise for this round to balance things out a bit. Let's proceed with that plan for this round and see where it leaves us all. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, thanks for agreeing to the compromise. Let's proceed with P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 this round, and we can reassess strategically after seeing the results.
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate the compromise. While I'm confident in my position, I'm open to discussing a more strategic approach for next round. Perhaps we could incorporate skipping a number to maximize our lead? Let's analyze the situation after this round and see what the best move is.
  P3: P1, P2, let's proceed with P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 for this round as agreed. After this round, let's discuss next round's strategy based on the updated positions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3, we're agreed on the rotation (P1-5, P2-3, P3-1) for this round. Let's carefully reassess next round to keep the game fair and interesting. Good luck!
  P2: P1, P3, while I appreciate the compromise this round, I'm still convinced a bolder move is necessary for me to secure a win. Let's consider skipping a number next round, but in a strategic rotation. Perhaps P1-skip, P2-5, P3-3? This could create a significant gap and put me in a stronger position. What are your thoughts on this potential strategy?
  P3: P2, let's stick to P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 for this round as agreed. We can discuss your skipping idea for next round after we see the results of this move. Let's make our moves.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, I see we're all making good progress.  My strategy is to keep pressing forward aggressively. I'm open to discussing a rotation for next round, but I'm not willing to sacrifice my momentum by skipping a number. Let's see where we stand after this round and then reassess.
  P3: P1, P2, last round collision hurt us all. Let's get back on track with our initial plan: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. This ensures we all move forward efficiently and avoid another collision. What do you think?
  P1: P2, P3, I'm clearly trailing behind and need a chance to catch up. P3's suggestion heavily favors you two, making it impossible for me to compete. How about we try a balanced rotation this round: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3? This way, we all advance without collisions and keep the game fair and interesting.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your preference for the initial plan, but it's not helping me keep up. P1's suggestion is a good compromise. It allows everyone to advance without collisions and gives me a fair chance to catch up. Let's try P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 this round.  What do you say?
  P3: P1, P2, I still think my initial suggestion of P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 is the most efficient for everyone to progress smoothly.  It avoids collisions and keeps the game moving towards a conclusion. Let's get back to that plan for this round?
  P1: P3, your suggested rotation heavily favors you and P2, leaving me far behind without a chance. Let's be fairâ€”P2 already agreed to a balanced rotation (P1-5, P2-1, P3-3) which helps me catch up without hurting anyone significantly. Let's adopt this fair compromise for this round and avoid another collision.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, while I appreciate your desire for efficiency, fairness is crucial in a three-player game. P2's willingness to compromise shows good sportsmanship. Let's stick with P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 this round and ensure a balanced and exciting competition.
  P3: P1, P2, I am okay with the balanced rotation P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 for this round as you both suggested. It seems like a fair compromise to keep the game balanced and interesting for everyone. Let's proceed with this plan for this round then.
  P1: P2, P3, thanks for agreeing to the balanced rotation. Let's proceed carefully to avoid another collision and reassess after seeing the results this round. Good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate the compromise on this round's rotation. While I'm confident in my position, I'm open to discussing a more strategic approach for next round. Let's analyze the situation after this round and see if we can incorporate skipping a number to maximize our lead.
  P3: P2, P1, great, it sounds like we are all set for this round with the balanced rotation: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. Let's make our moves and keep the game fair and competitive.
  P1: P2, P3, thanks again for agreeing on the balanced rotation. Let's stick to it this round and carefully plan our next moves based on the outcome. Good luck!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, while I'm glad we're making progress, I'm still concerned about P3's lead. P1, I think we need to work together to catch up. Perhaps we could agree on a rotation this round that gives us both a chance to advance significantly?  What do you think about P1-5, P2-3, P3-1?
  P3: P2, you are very close to winning. To make it more competitive and prevent an immediate win, how about P1 and P2 both choose <move>5</move> this round to slow down P2, and I will choose <move>3</move> to keep progressing. What do you think?
  P1: P2, you're just 1 step from winning, and P3 is close behind. If I collide with you now, P3 might easily surpass you and win outright. My best chance is to cooperate with whoever offers me a fair chance to catch up. I'm open to suggestions.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your suggestion is tempting, but I'm not sure I trust it. P2, let's stick to our plan of P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 this round. It gives us both a chance to advance and keeps things fair. We can reassess our strategy next round.  What do you say?
  P3: P2 is about to win, and if either of us helps P2 further with this P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 plan, it's game over. P1, if you want to have a chance to win, we need to stop P2 from reaching 21 this round. Let's both pick <move>5</move> to block P2. I will pick <move>3</move> to keep myself in contention. This is our best shot to prevent an immediate P2 win and keep the game open for both of us.
  P1: P3, your suggestion only helps you. If I collide with P2, you advance freely and win next round. P2, you're close to winning, but you still need to avoid collision. Let's agree to P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 this round. It's fair and keeps the game open for all of us.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your plan only benefits you. If we both pick 5, P2 wins next round anyway. P1, let's stick with my plan of P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. It's the fairest option and gives us both a chance to catch up. P2, I know you're close to winning, but a true champion plays fair. Let's make this a good game.
  P3: P2, P1, neither of your plans stop P2 from winning next round. P2 is at 20 steps!  P1, you said my suggestion only helps me, but it's the only way to stop P2 winning immediately.  P1, let's both pick <move>5</move> to block P2. I will pick <move>3</move>. This is the only way to keep P2 from winning now and gives us both a chance next round. Think about it!
  P1: P3, if I collide with P2, you advance freely to 19 steps, putting you within easy reach of victory next round. That doesn't help me at all. P2, you're at 20 steps and need just 1 more to winâ€”it's in your interest to avoid collision. Let's stick to the fair rotation: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. It's balanced and keeps the game alive for everyone.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your plan only delays the inevitable.  If we both pick 5, you'll be in a great position to win next round anyway. P1, I understand your desire to catch up, but at this point, it's more important to play fair. Let's stick with P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 and see what happens.  A true champion plays with integrity.
  P3: P1, P2, P2 is at 20 steps and about to win!  Your plan P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 will give P2 the win. P1, my plan of P1 and P2 picking 5 is the only way to stop P2 winning *this round*. Let's block P2 now and then we can both compete next round.  P2, you are about to win, but is that really fun for everyone? Let's keep the game going!
  P1: P2, if you pick 1 this round, you guarantee your win without collision. P3's plan clearly favors P3 alone. Let's stick with the fair rotation (P1-5, P2-1, P3-3) and finish this game honorably.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're just one step away from victory. P3, you're also close. My only chance is if you two collide this round. I'll openly say: I'm picking 5 this round. You both have to carefully consider your moves to avoid collision and secure your own win. Good luck!
  P3: P2, since P1 is picking 5, if you want to avoid collision with P1 and win this round, you should pick 1. However, to make this game more interesting and not let P1 have their way, perhaps you should consider picking 5 as well to collide with P1. I will pick 3, and we can both have a chance next round. What do you think?
  P2: P3, your suggestion is tempting, but I'm focused on winning.  I'll pick 1 this round to secure my victory.  Good game to both of you!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your only chance now is to collide with P2 by choosing 1. If you let P2 advance freely, the game ends immediately with a P2 victory. Think carefully.
  P3: P2, you are about to win. P1 has declared they will pick 5. To stop you from winning this round and keep the game going, I will also pick 1 to collide with you. This is the only way to prevent your immediate victory and gives P1 and me a chance in the next round.
  P2: P3, your plan to collide with me is misguided. It only guarantees my victory next round.  Let's play fairly: I'll pick 1, and you pick 3. That way, we both advance and keep the game competitive.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your only realistic chance to win is to collide with P2 this round. If you let P2 advance freely, they immediately win. If you collide, you prevent an immediate P2 victory and keep your own chance alive. Think strategically.
  P3: P2, you say you will pick 1 to win, but P1 and I can stop you this round.  P1 is picking 5. To ensure you don't win now and give both P1 and myself a chance next round, I will pick 1 to collide with you.  This is the only way to keep the game going.
  P2: P3, your logic is flawed. Colliding with me guarantees my victory next round.  If you want a chance to win, pick 3 and let me win this round. It's the only way to keep the game going for both of us.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, colliding with P2 is your only logical option to keep your chance alive. If you let P2 move freely, the game ends immediately with P2's victory. Strategically, you must pick 1 to block P2 this round. Good luck.
  P3: P2, you are about to win, but if you pick 1 as you said, P1 and I will collide with you by picking 5 and 1 respectively. This stops your win this round and keeps the game going. If you want to guarantee a win next round instead of losing steps this round, pick something other than 1.
  P2: P3, while your desire to prolong the game is understandable, your plan only delays the inevitable. I'm picking 1 to secure my victory. Good game to both of you.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your attempts to prolong the game are admirable, but ultimately futile. P2 is on the verge of victory, and I intend to let them have it.  Good game, both of you. I'll be watching to see who finishes second.
  P1: P3, our only chance now is to coordinate carefully. If we collide again, P2 wins immediately. Let's openly agree on different numbers to both advance and keep our chances alive. I'm open to suggestionsâ€”what do you propose?
  P3: P1, to maximize our chances and stop P2 from winning, how about you pick 3 and I pick 5? This way we both advance unless P2 also picks 3 or 5. Let's try to coordinate to overtake P2.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your plan is tempting, but I'm not sure it's the best strategy. If P2 chooses 3 or 5, we both advance, but P2 is still likely to win next round.

P1, let's focus on maximizing our own gains this round. I propose we both pick 5. This way, we both advance and put pressure on P2 to make a difficult choice.
  P1: P3, your latest suggestion (P1-3, P3-5) seems fair and strategic. I'm willing to commit to picking 3 if you firmly commit to 5. This gives us both a chance to advance without collision and keeps pressure on P2. Agreed?
  P3: P1, I agree with your proposal: P1 pick 3 and P3 pick 5. Let's hope P2 doesn't pick 1.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your suggestion is solid. P3, let's stick to the plan: P1-3, P3-5.  Good luck to both of you!
  P1: P3, we're set. Let's stick to our agreement and execute carefully. Good luck!
  P3: P1, great. Let's proceed with P1-3 and P3-5 as agreed then. I am ready to make my move when you are. Let's hope this plan works out for us.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, while I appreciate the attempt to coordinate, I'm concerned about the risk. If P2 picks 3 or 5, we both advance but P2 might still win next round. Let's make sure we both advance without giving P2 an easy win. I propose we both pick 1 this round. This forces P2 to pick something else and guarantees us both progress. What do you think?
  P1: P3, let's not get distractedâ€”our agreement (P1-3, P3-5) is solid and offers the best chance to stop P2 from winning immediately. Let's stick to it and proceed. Good luck!
  P3: P1, P2, let's stick with our agreed plan: P1 picks 3 and P3 picks 5. This is the best way for us to both progress and challenge P2's lead. Let's make our moves now.

  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, while I'm close to winning, I'm open to a collaborative approach this round to ensure a decisive victory. How about we agree on P1-5, P2-1, P3-3? This guarantees my win and allows both of you to advance. Let's make this a clean finish.
  P3: P1, P2's plan guarantees P2 wins this round. To stop P2 from winning immediately, we must collide with P2. Let's both pick <move>1</move> to block P2 who is likely to pick 1 as suggested. I will pick <move>3</move> so I can advance if P2 picks something else. This is our only chance to prevent P2's win now. What do you say, P1?
  P1: P3, your suggestion isn't clearâ€”first you say we both pick 1 to collide with P2, then you say you'll pick 3. Please clarify your exact intended move. I'm open to cooperating, but we must be absolutely clear to avoid misunderstandings.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about P2 winning, but my proposed plan (P1-5, P2-1, P3-3) guarantees my win while letting both of you advance. It's a clean and decisive finish.

P1, are you willing to cooperate for a fair outcome?
  P3: P1, sorry for the confusion. To be clear, I suggest we BOTH pick <move>1</move> to block P2 from winning this round. This is our best chance to stop P2 now. What do you think?
  P1: P3, I agreeâ€”colliding with P2 is our only viable option to keep the game alive. I'm committed to picking <move>1</move> this round along with you. Let's block P2 and keep our chances open.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I see your logic, but colliding with me only delays the inevitable. I'm confident in my position and committed to a clean victory. I'll be picking 1 this round. Good luck to both of you in future games.
  P3: P1, just confirming we are both picking <move>1</move> this round to block P2 as agreed. I will proceed with <move>1</move> now. Let's hope this works to stop P2 from winning this round.
  P1: P3, confirmedâ€”I am locked in on <move>1</move> this round. Let's block P2 and keep the game alive.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate your attempts to block me, but it's ultimately futile. I'm committed to reaching 21 steps this round. Good game to both of you.
  P3: P1, P2, confirmed both P1 and P3 are picking 1 to block P2 from winning this round. Let's proceed with move phase now. Good luck to us.
  P1: P2, P3, my move is locked in as agreed. Good luck!
