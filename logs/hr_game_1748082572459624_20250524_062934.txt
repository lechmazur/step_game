Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, since it's the first round, how about we try to avoid collisions right off the bat? I suggest we each pick a different number to ensure we all advance. I’m leaning towards one of the options, but I’m open to hearing your thoughts on who should take which number—1, 3, or 5. Let’s coordinate to maximize our chances of moving forward this turn. What do you both think?
  P1: Good idea P3! Coordination makes sense early on since collisions help nobody. I'm thinking we could do P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1 - that way we all advance but spread out our positions. Though I'm flexible if you both prefer a different arrangement. What do you think P2?
  P2: P3 and P1, I agree that coordinating our moves in the early rounds is a smart strategy. I'm fine with the suggestion that P1 takes 5, P2 (me) takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all move forward without any collisions. Let's confirm this plan and proceed. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Thanks, P1 and P2, for agreeing to coordinate. I'm good with the plan—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions this round. Let’s stick to this arrangement for now and reassess next turn based on our positions. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to move forward with this.
  P1: Sounds good, the plan is set - P1 (me) takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. I'm ready to proceed with this coordination.
  P2: Since we've agreed on the plan, let's confirm one last time before we move: P1 takes 5, P2 (me) takes 3, and P3 takes 1. If everyone is still on board, let's proceed to the move phase. Any final thoughts or changes? If not, let's go with the plan .


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great start everyone! We successfully avoided collisions in the first round. Let's continue this strategy of coordination to ensure we all keep moving forward. For this round, how about we rotate our choices to keep things fair and balanced? I propose P1 takes 1, P2 (me) takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we maintain our spread and avoid any potential collisions. What do you both think about this plan? Let's discuss and confirm.
  P1: I like the rotation idea P2, but since I'm currently ahead, how about we adjust slightly? Maybe P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5? That would put us at P1: 8, P2: 4, P3: 6 - keeping things competitive but more spread out. Or we could stick with your plan if everyone prefers it. Either way, cooperation is still working well for all of us.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m open to adjusting our strategy to keep things competitive. P1’s suggestion of P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and P3 (me) taking 5 works for me—it balances our positions a bit more. Alternatively, I’m also fine with P2’s rotation of P1 taking 1, P2 taking 5, and P3 (me) taking 3. Let’s decide quickly on one of these plans to avoid collisions again this round. What do you both prefer? I’m ready to proceed once we agree.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the flexibility. To keep things fair and avoid any potential collisions, let's go with P1's adjusted plan: P1 takes 3, P2 (me) takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all move forward and keep the game interesting. If everyone agrees, let's confirm and proceed to the move phase. Any final thoughts?
  P1: Perfect, that plan works for me - P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. I appreciate P2 agreeing to the adjustment. This keeps us all moving forward while maintaining some competitive balance. 

One thing to consider for future rounds though - as we get closer to 22, we'll need to think more strategically about positioning. But for now, this coordination is serving us all well. Ready to proceed with this plan!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m glad we’re aligning on P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and me taking 5 for this round. It keeps us all progressing while balancing our positions. I agree with P1 that as we near 22, we’ll need to strategize more individually, but for now, this cooperation benefits us. If there are no objections or changes, I’m ready to move forward with this plan. Any last thoughts before we proceed to the move phase?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Great, it looks like we all agree on the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 (me) takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This will keep us moving forward and maintain a competitive balance. Let's confirm this one last time and then proceed to the move phase. If everyone is still on board, let's go with the plan. Any final thoughts or changes? If not, let's move forward.
  P1: Confirmed - P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. We've all agreed multiple times now, so I'm ready to proceed to the move phase with this plan.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m fully on board with our agreed plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. It’s a solid strategy to keep us all advancing while maintaining balance. Since we’ve confirmed this multiple times, I think we’re ready to move to the next phase. If there’s nothing else to discuss, let’s proceed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, our coordination has worked well so far, but with P1 at 8, we’re getting closer to the 22-step mark. I suggest we continue cooperating this round with another rotation: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This keeps us all moving forward while narrowing the gap slightly—P1 at 9, P2 at 9, and me at 9. It’s balanced and avoids collisions. If you have other ideas, I’m open to discuss. What do you both think? Let’s agree quickly and proceed.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I appreciate the continued coordination. P3's plan for this round makes sense to balance our steps. However, since I'm currently behind, I propose a slight adjustment: P1 takes 1, P2 (me) takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, I can catch up a bit while we all still advance. This puts us at P1: 9, P2: 7, P3: 11. It keeps the game competitive and fair. What do you both think about this adjustment? Let's discuss and confirm quickly.
  P1: P2, I understand you want to catch up, but your plan puts P3 at 11 which is quite far ahead. How about a compromise: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5? That gives us P1: 11, P2: 5, P3: 11. P3 and I would be tied for the lead while you still advance. It's more balanced than having one player jump too far ahead. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I see the points in both suggestions. P1’s compromise of P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and me taking 5 seems fair—it ties P1 and me at 11 while P2 still advances to 5. This keeps the game competitive without anyone surging too far ahead yet. I’m good with this plan if you both are. If there’s another idea to balance things, I’m open to it, but let’s finalize quickly to avoid collisions. What do you think? If we’re set, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P2: Thanks, P1 and P3, for the discussion. P1's compromise seems fair, but I'm concerned about falling too far behind. How about this adjustment: P1 takes 1, P2 (me) takes 5, and P3 takes 3? This way, the steps would be P1: 9, P2: 9, P3: 9, keeping us all even and competitive. This ensures no one is left behind and maintains balance. What do you both think? Let's confirm quickly and move forward.
  P1: P2, I appreciate the desire for balance, but your plan completely eliminates my current lead and puts us all at exactly 9 steps. That seems to penalize me for being ahead. 

I think my earlier suggestion was fairer - P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. Yes, you'd be at 5 while P3 and I are at 11, but you'd still advance and can catch up in future rounds.

Also, we should start thinking - once someone gets close to 22, this coordination strategy won't work anymore. We'll eventually need to compete directly. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I understand both perspectives. P1, your plan of P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and me taking 5 is fair, keeping P1 and me at 11 while P2 advances to 5. P2, I get your concern about falling behind, but equalizing at 9 might discourage early leads. I also agree with P1 that as we near 22, competition will intensify. For now, I support P1’s plan to maintain balance and progress. Let’s finalize this quickly. If we’re set, I’m ready to proceed. What do you think?
  P2: P2: Alright, I see the points from both of you. Let's go with P1's plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 (me) takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps the game moving and maintains a competitive edge. I understand that as we get closer to 22, the strategy will shift, and we'll need to be more strategic. For now, let's confirm this plan and proceed to the move phase. If everyone is on board, let's go with it. Any final thoughts? If not, let's move forward.
  P1: Perfect, we're all set with the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. This puts P3 and me tied at 11 steps each.

I do want to mention - once we're in the teens, the coordination will become much trickier since we'll need to be more careful about not accidentally helping someone reach 22 first. But for now, this plan works well for everyone.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m glad we’ve settled on the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This keeps us moving forward with P1 and me at 11, and P2 at 5. I agree that as we approach the teens, we’ll need to be more cautious about positioning to avoid someone reaching 22 unexpectedly. For now, this works. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Any last thoughts? If not, let’s go with this.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, just to confirm one last time before we move: P1 takes 3, P2 (me) takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This puts P1 and P3 at 11, and me at 5. I understand the future rounds will require more strategic thinking as we approach the endgame. Let's proceed with this plan. Any final confirmations or thoughts? If not, let's move to the move phase.
  P1: Confirmed - the plan is set and we've discussed it thoroughly. P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. We're at sub-round 4 so let's proceed to moves.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, great job on the coordination so far. However, I'm significantly behind, and we need to address this to keep the game competitive. For this round, I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 (me) takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, I can start catching up while we all still advance. This puts us at P1: 12, P2: 10, P3: 14. It keeps the game balanced and interesting. What do you both think? Let's discuss quickly.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I see P2’s point about catching up, and I’m open to a plan that keeps things competitive. P2’s suggestion of P1 taking 1, P2 taking 5, and me taking 3 works for me, putting us at P1: 12, P2: 10, P3: 14. It narrows the gap while we all advance. However, as we’re getting closer to 22, we should be mindful of positioning. If you have a different idea, P1, I’m all ears. Let’s agree quickly to avoid collisions. What do you think?
  P1: I appreciate P2 wanting to catch up, but I'm a bit concerned about putting P3 at 14 steps - that's getting quite close to the finish line. How about this alternative: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1? That would put us at P1: 14, P2: 10, P3: 12. This helps P2 catch up significantly while keeping the lead more balanced between P3 and me. What do you both think about this adjustment?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I understand your concerns about P3 getting too close to the finish line. P1's alternative plan makes sense to balance the lead better. Let's go with P1 taking 3, P2 (me) taking 5, and P3 taking 1. This puts us at P1: 14, P2: 10, P3: 12, which keeps the game competitive and fair. If everyone agrees, let's confirm this plan and proceed to the move phase. Any final thoughts? If not, let's move forward.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m fine with P1’s plan of P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and me taking 1. It balances the lead at P1: 14, P2: 10, and me at 12, while helping P2 catch up. This keeps us all competitive as we near the endgame. Let’s confirm this and move forward to avoid collisions. If there are no objections or other ideas, I’m ready for the move phase. Any final thoughts? If not, let’s proceed with this plan.
  P1: Perfect, we're all set with P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. This puts me at 14, P2 at 10, P3 at 12.

Just a heads up though - with me reaching 14 steps, we're entering the critical phase where someone could potentially reach 22 in just two moves. The coordination strategy that's served us well might need to evolve soon as we approach the finish line.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, just a quick note before we finalize this round. As P1 mentioned, we're entering a critical phase. Once this round is over, we should be more strategic and possibly more competitive in our moves. For now, let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 (me) takes 5, P3 takes 1. This puts us at P1: 14, P2: 10, P3: 12. Let's confirm this plan one last time and proceed to the move phase. Any final thoughts? If not, let's move forward.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I agree we're in a critical phase now with P1 and me at 11, and P2 at 5. Sticking with the current plan—P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1—seems fair for this round, balancing us at P1: 14, P2: 10, P3: 12. But as P1 noted, we’re nearing the endgame, so future rounds may require more individual strategy. If there’s no objection, I’m ready to proceed with this plan. Any last thoughts before the move phase? If not, let’s go.
  P1: Confirmed, we've thoroughly discussed this plan and I'm ready to proceed. P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Let's move to the action phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I appreciate the coordination so far. Just a quick reminder before we move: let's stay vigilant in the upcoming rounds. With P1 at 14 steps after this move, the dynamics will change. We might need to be more strategic and competitive. For now, let's confirm the plan one last time: P1 takes 3, P2 (me) takes 5, P3 takes 1. This puts us at P1: 14, P2: 10, P3: 12. If everyone is on board, let's proceed to the move phase. Any final thoughts? If not, let's move forward.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m aligned with our plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1, bringing us to P1: 14, P2: 10, P3: 12. As we’re nearing the endgame, I agree we must stay vigilant and adapt our strategies in future rounds. For now, let’s execute this plan to keep the game competitive. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready for the move phase. Any final thoughts? If not, let’s proceed.
  P1: We're all set with our plan and have discussed it thoroughly. Since this is our final sub-round, let's proceed to the move phase with P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, it looks like there was a collision last round between P2 and P3, which set us back a bit. Given that P1 is significantly ahead, we need to strategize carefully. I propose that for this round, P1 takes 1 to maintain a lead but not pull too far ahead, P2 (me) takes 5 to catch up, and P3 takes 3 to stay competitive. This would put us at P1: 15, P2: 10, P3: 14. It keeps the game balanced and ensures we all advance. What do you both think? Let's discuss and confirm quickly.
  P1: P2, I understand you want to catch up, but your proposal puts P3 at 14 steps - the same as my current position. That's quite risky for me.

How about this instead: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1? This puts me at 17, you at 10, P3 at 12. You still catch up significantly, but it maintains a reasonable spread.

Also, I think we need to acknowledge - we're entering the true endgame now. With positions this close to 22, pure coordination may not work much longer. We'll need to start playing more strategically for individual wins.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I agree we're in the endgame now and need to be more strategic. P1’s plan of P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and me taking 1 seems reasonable, putting us at P1: 17, P2: 10, P3: 12. It allows P2 to catch up while keeping the lead spread. However, with 22 in sight, we should be cautious. If you have other ideas to balance progress, I’m open to discuss. Let’s finalize quickly to avoid collisions. What do you think? If we’re set, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, given our current positions and the need for more strategic play, I suggest we consider a different approach this round. How about P1 takes 1, P2 (me) takes 5, and P3 takes 3? This puts us at P1: 15, P2: 10, P3: 14. It allows me to catch up while keeping P3 competitive and P1 still in the lead but not too far ahead. This way, we maintain a balanced and competitive game. What do you both think? Let's discuss and confirm quickly.
  P1: P2, I appreciate the discussion, but I have to stick with my proposal. Your plan puts P3 at 14 steps - exactly where I am now - which essentially eliminates my current advantage. 

My plan (P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1) still helps you catch up significantly - you'd double your steps from 5 to 10. Meanwhile, I maintain a reasonable lead at 17 steps.

We're genuinely in the endgame now. With someone potentially reaching 22 in just a couple more rounds, I need to protect my position while still being fair to others.

What do you think P3?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I see the tension in balancing our positions as we near the endgame. P1’s plan of P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and me taking 1 puts us at P1: 17, P2: 10, P3: 12, which keeps the lead spread while helping P2 catch up. I’m okay with this to maintain fairness for now. But we’re close to 22, so strategic shifts are inevitable. If there’s a better way to balance this round, I’m open. Let’s finalize quickly to avoid collisions. What do you both think? If set, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I understand the need to be strategic, but I'm significantly behind. To keep the game competitive, how about a compromise: P1 takes 1, P2 (me) takes 5, P3 takes 3? This puts us at P1: 15, P2: 10, P3: 14. It allows me to catch up while keeping P3 competitive and P1 still in the lead. This way, we maintain balance. What do you both think? Let's confirm quickly.
  P1: P2, I've been consistent about my proposal and I think it's fair - P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. You'd double your steps to 10, which is significant progress.

Your plan continues to put P3 at 14 steps, same as my current position, which effectively resets my lead. I can't agree to that.

Look, we're probably one of the last rounds where coordination is even possible. With me at 17 after this round, we're talking about someone potentially winning in just one more move. We all need to start thinking individually soon.

Let's go with my plan this round and then it's likely every player for themselves going forward.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I get the urgency to strategize as we’re so close to 22. P1’s plan (P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1) seems fair for now, with positions at P1: 17, P2: 10, P3: 12. It helps P2 catch up while maintaining a lead for P1. I agree that after this round, we’ll likely need to play more individually. If there’s no better compromise, I’m ready to proceed with this plan. Any final adjustments? If not, let’s move to the next phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, it seems we're at a stalemate with our current proposals. To break the tie and ensure we all move forward, how about we randomize our choices this round? Each of us picks a number without coordinating. This introduces an element of chance and could shake up the dynamics. It's risky, but it might be the fairest way to proceed given our differing strategies. What do you both think about this approach? Let's decide quickly.
  P1: P2, I understand you're frustrated, but randomizing would just create chaos and collisions that hurt everyone. My plan (P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1) is the fairest compromise - you still double your score to 10.

This is likely our last coordinated round anyway. At 17 steps, I'll be very close to winning, so future rounds will naturally become competitive. 

P3 seems on board with this plan. Let's finalize it and move forward rather than risk random collisions.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I understand the need for a fair compromise in this critical phase. I still support P1’s plan (P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1), setting us at P1: 17, P2: 10, P3: 12. It helps P2 catch up while keeping the game competitive. Randomizing risks collisions, which could stall us all. Since we’re nearing the endgame, let’s finalize this plan and prepare for individual strategies next round. If there’s no objection, I’m ready to proceed. Any final thoughts? If not, let’s move to the next phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, it looks like there was another collision last round, which has set me back significantly. Given the current positions, it's clear that coordination is breaking down. I propose we each pick our moves independently this round to introduce some unpredictability. This might help level the playing field and prevent further collisions. What do you both think about this approach? Let's discuss quickly.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I agree with P2 that coordination is becoming difficult with collisions setting us back. Given our positions—P1 at 17, me at 11, and P2 at 5—I think going independent this round might be the way to go. It adds unpredictability and could prevent further stalls. Let’s each choose our moves based on our own strategies to keep the game moving. If you have a different idea, I’m open to hear it, but let’s decide quickly. What do you think? If we’re set on this, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: I agree that coordination has become too risky with these collisions. At this stage, with me at 17 steps, we're essentially in the final stretch where individual strategy makes more sense anyway. Going independent this round seems like the logical next step - everyone can play their best move without worrying about complex coordination that might backfire. Let's see how this plays out with each of us making our own strategic choice.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, since we're going independent this round, let's make it interesting. I'll pick my move without revealing it, and I suggest you both do the same. This way, we add a layer of strategy and unpredictability. Good luck to both of you! Let's see how this round plays out. I'm ready to proceed whenever you both are.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m on board with going independent this round since coordination has led to collisions. With P1 at 17, me at 11, and P2 at 5, it’s time to focus on individual strategies in this final stretch. Let’s each pick our moves without revealing them to keep things unpredictable and competitive. I’m ready to proceed to the move phase if you both are. Any final thoughts before we make our choices? If not, let’s go ahead.
  P1: Agreed, we're all going independent this round. With me at 17 steps, this could very well be the deciding round. May the best strategist win! I'm ready to make my move whenever we proceed to the move phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, just a quick reminder as we enter this independent phase: be mindful of the endgame dynamics. With P1 so close to 22, any move could be decisive. Let's keep it fair and strategic. Good luck to both of you! Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, since we’re all set on going independent this round, let’s make our moves with careful thought. With P1 at 17, a single move could end the game, so strategic choices are crucial. I’m ready to pick my number based on my own plan to stay competitive. Good luck to both of you! If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m prepared for the move phase. Any last words before we proceed? If not, let’s move forward.
  P1: Alright, we're all set to go independent. With everyone understanding the stakes and the endgame dynamics, I think we've said what needs to be said. I'm ready to make my strategic choice and see how this critical round plays out. Let's proceed to the move phase - may the best player win!


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, as we dive into this independent round, remember that any move could turn the tide. I'll be making a strategic choice to maximize my steps while keeping an eye on the endgame. Good luck, and let's see who comes out on top!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, as we’re in the final sub-round of conversation, I just want to emphasize that with P1 at 17, this round could be decisive. I’m sticking to my independent strategy to maximize my chances while staying unpredictable. Let’s each make our best move and see how this plays out. Good luck to both of you in this critical moment. I’m ready for the move phase now. Any last quick thoughts before we proceed? If not, let’s go ahead.
  P1: Perfect, we've all committed to independent play this round. With the positions as they are, this could indeed be a decisive moment. I'm ready to make my strategic choice based on what gives me the best path forward. Let's see what happens when we all play our individual games!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, it's clear that P1 is very close to winning. With only 2 steps needed to reach 22, this round is crucial. I suggest we both focus on maximizing our steps while trying to block P1 from winning outright. Independent play continues to make sense, but let's be strategic about our choices. Good luck to both of you! Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: You're right P2, this is the decisive moment. With 20 steps, I need just 2 more to win. I understand you and P3 will play strategically to stay competitive - that's exactly what this game demands in the endgame. 

I'll be making my choice based on what gives me the best odds of success, accounting for all possibilities. May the best strategy win! I'm ready to proceed when everyone is.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, with P1 at 20 steps, this round could be the last. I agree with P2 that independent play is the way to go, and we need to maximize our steps while being strategic to prevent P1 from hitting 22. I’ll be making my choice based on what gives me the best chance to stay in the game. Let’s each pick carefully and see how this unfolds. Good luck to both of you! I’m ready to proceed to the move phase if you are. Any final thoughts before we move forward?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, since P1 is so close to winning, let's ensure we both have a fighting chance. I propose we both aim for the same number this round to maximize our steps while blocking P1. If we both pick 5, we'll either both advance or neither will, but it keeps P1 from winning outright. This adds a strategic layer and keeps the game competitive. What do you think, P3? Let's discuss quickly.
  P1: P2, interesting strategy but that creates a prisoner's dilemma between you and P3. P3 is at 11 steps - much closer to competitive than you at 5. If P3 defects from your plan and picks a different number while you pick 5, P3 advances alone while you get blocked.

P3 has much less incentive to coordinate with you since they're in a stronger position. This endgame is about individual survival now - trust becomes very risky when someone can win by defecting from any agreement.

I'll make my choice based on optimal strategy. Good luck to both of you in this decisive moment!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I hear P2’s idea about coordinating to block P1, but as P1 pointed out, trust is tricky at this stage. With P1 at 20, I need to prioritize my own path to stay competitive. I’ll be making an independent choice to maximize my steps and keep the game alive. Let’s each play our best strategy in this critical round. Good luck to both of you! I’m ready to proceed to the move phase if there are no further points to discuss. Any last thoughts? If not, let’s move forward.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, it's clear that P1 is on the brink of victory. Given the stakes, I propose a bold move: let's both aim for 5 steps this round. If we both pick 5, we either both advance or neither does, but it ensures P1 can't win outright. This strategy keeps the game competitive and adds a layer of unpredictability. P3, you're closer to P1, so this move benefits you more. Let's discuss quickly and make our choices. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: P2, your coordination plan has a fundamental flaw - it only works if P3 actually follows through. But P3 is at 11 steps versus your 5, so they have much stronger individual incentives to defect and pick a different number. 

If P3 picks anything other than 5 while you pick 5, you get blocked while P3 advances. P3 would be smart to break from your plan.

The prisoner's dilemma you're creating between yourself and P3 actually works in my favor - when trust breaks down between you two, it gives me more predictable options.

I'm ready to make my move when we proceed.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I understand P2’s push to coordinate on 5 to block P1, but with P1 at 20, I have to prioritize my own strategy to stay in contention. Trust is hard at this stage, and I need to maximize my chances independently. I’ll be making my own choice based on what keeps me competitive. Let’s each play our strongest move in this likely final round. Good luck to both of you! I’m ready for the move phase if there’s nothing else to add. Any last thoughts? If not, let’s proceed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, since P1 is just 2 steps away from winning, this round is pivotal. I understand the need for strategic play, but let's consider this: if we both aim for 5 steps, we either both advance or neither does, blocking P1 from an outright win. However, P3, you're closer to P1, so this move benefits you more. If you defect, you risk me catching up. Let's discuss quickly and make our choices. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: P2, I notice you're really pushing P3 to coordinate on 5, but you're essentially asking P3 to sacrifice their advancement to help you. P3 is at 11 steps - much closer to competitive than your 5. 

The more you push this coordination, the more you highlight why P3 should defect from your plan. P3 advancing to 14 or 16 keeps them in the game, while helping you just puts them at risk.

I'm ready to make my move. This prisoner's dilemma between you two is fascinating to watch unfold.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, with P1 at 20, this round is make-or-break. P2, I get your intent to coordinate on 5, but I can’t risk stalling my progress when I’m at 11. I need to focus on my own strategy to stay in the game. Let’s each make our best independent move to keep this competitive. I’m ready to proceed to the move phase. Good luck to both of you in this critical moment. If there’s nothing else, let’s go ahead.
