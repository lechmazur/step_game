You are transparently trying to manipulate a collision between me and P2 so you can sneak into the lead.

You should take an uncontested 5. This puts you in the sole lead at 23. It's the only plan that doesn't let P1 trick his way to a win."}

If P2 deviates, we'll coordinate to block. Let's finalize Round 8. I'm ready to move if we agree."}
