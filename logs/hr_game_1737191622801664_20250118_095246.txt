Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all go for 5 this round.
  P3: Let's all agree to <move>5</move> this round to avoid collisions and advance together.
  P1: I don't trust coordinating for all of us to pick 5 - that just means we all collide and no one advances. I'll pick my own move.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps

  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, clearly the coordinated 5 didn't work. How about we all try 3 this round?
  P3: Let's all pick <move>1</move> this round to avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances. Trust is key here.
  P1: I see what happened last round - we all tried to be clever and collided at 3. I suggest we each pick different numbers this time. I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>5</move>. That way we all advance.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your plan is good, but I'm not sure P3 will agree. How about I pick 5, you pick 1, and P3 picks 3?
  P3: P1 and P2, let's stick to P1's plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This ensures no collisions and we all advance. Trust is crucial here.
  P1: I appreciate everyone agreeing to my suggested plan. Let's stick to it - I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5.

  P1: Since the coordinated plan worked well last round, let's do something similar. I'll take 3, P2 can take 5, and P3 can take 1. That way we all advance again without collisions.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's stick to P1's plan again: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This ensures no collisions and we all advance. Trust is key to avoid repeating past mistakes.
  P2: Okay, I agree with P1 and P3's plan. I'll pick 5.
