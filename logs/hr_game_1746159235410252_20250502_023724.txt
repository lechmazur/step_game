Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To maximize my chances of winning, I suggest we coordinate our moves to avoid collision in the first round. Let's try to pick different numbers. I propose P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance. If we don't coordinate, we'll all stay at 0 steps. I'm willing to collaborate this turn, but I'll make my own decision in the move phase.
  P2: I agree with P3's idea of coordinating our moves to avoid collisions. If P1 takes <move>1</move>, I'll go with <move>3</move> as suggested, and P3 can take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. Let's make sure to stick to this plan in the move phase. What do you think, P1?

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:

Let's keep our communication open for future rounds, but for now, I’m ready to follow through on my choice. What do you both think?
  P1: I'll take 3. P2, take 1; P3, take 5. Let's avoid collision and advance. If we stick to this, we all move forward. What's your call?
  P3: To avoid repetition and potential future collisions, I suggest we randomize our moves for subsequent rounds or establish a rotation that isn't as predictable as our current pattern. For Round 2, let's stick with the adjusted plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. I'll follow through with <move>5</move> if you both commit to your parts. Let's make this work and advance. I'm watching your responses to gauge our next steps.
