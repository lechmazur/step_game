Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I'll take <move>1</move> this round if you both agree to take higher numbers. We can rotate strategies in future rounds to ensure steady progress for everyone. If we work together early, we can maximize our individual chances later. What do you say?
