Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to avoid collisions and all get different numbers. I suggest I take 3, what numbers would you prefer?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I think we should coordinate to maximize our chances. P2, if you’re taking 3, I’ll take 1. P3, you can take 5—let’s avoid collisions and all move forward. If we stick to this plan, we’ll make steady progress without blocking each other. Let me know if you agree or want to adjust.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: That sounds like a good plan P1. I'll stick with 3 as suggested. P3, are you on board with taking 5? This way we can all make progress.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, it seems like you're quiet, but this plan benefits all of us. If you take 5, we avoid collisions and everyone moves forward. Staying silent might mean you're considering something else—let us know your intentions so we can adjust if needed. Otherwise, I’ll proceed with 1, P2 takes 3, and you take 5. This coordination ensures no one gets blocked. Let’s confirm and move efficiently.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3's silence is concerning. While I still plan to take 3, we should be prepared for potential disruption. Let's proceed with caution.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your continued silence is making this unpredictable. If you’re not taking 5 as suggested, it risks a collision and slows us all down. I’m sticking with 1 for now, trusting P2 to take 3, but if you disrupt the plan, we’ll need to rethink our strategy moving forward. Let’s avoid unnecessary conflicts—confirm your move or adjust accordingly.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, last round worked well with no collisions—let’s keep coordinating to maintain progress. I’ll take 1 again to ensure steady advancement. P2, you can take 3 as before, and P3, you should stick with 5. This way, we all move forward without interference. If anyone plans to deviate, speak now so we can adjust. Otherwise, let’s confirm and proceed efficiently. Consistency is key to avoiding setbacks.
  P2: I agree we should maintain our successful pattern from last round. I'll stick with 3 again. It's working well for everyone so far.
  P3: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your silence continues to be unsettling. If you’re not sticking to 5 as agreed, it risks another collision and slows everyone down. I’m maintaining my choice of 1, trusting P2 to take 3 again. Deviating now only creates unnecessary conflict and delays. Let’s confirm the plan or clarify your intentions—otherwise, we’ll proceed as discussed. Consistency benefits all of us.
  P2: P3's silence worked in our favor last time since they followed the plan. I'll maintain my position with 3 unless either of you signals a change. This pattern is optimal for everyone's progress.
  P3: <stop>


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is clearly in the lead now with 10 steps. We need to consider adjusting our strategy. I suggest I take 5 this time to catch up, while P1 can keep 1. P3, would you consider taking 3 to allow for more balanced progress?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I understand the urge to catch up, but changing strategies now could backfire. P3 has been consistent with 5, and disrupting that risks collisions for all of us. I’ll stick with 1 as planned—steady progress is safer. P3, if you’re taking 5 again, let’s confirm so we avoid confusion. If you’re considering something else, speak up. Deviating from coordination only slows us down and benefits no one. Let’s stay predictable and efficient.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see your point P1, but P3's lead is significant. They might change their pattern since they're ahead. I'll maintain 3 for now to avoid risking a collision, but we should stay alert. Let's proceed cautiously.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your silence is becoming a pattern, but it’s clear you’re taking 5 consistently. I’ll stick with 1 again—predictability keeps us moving forward. P2, reverting to 3 is a safe call to avoid collisions. If P3 continues with 5, we maintain steady progress without setbacks. Deviating now only creates unnecessary risks. Let’s confirm this plan and move efficiently. If anyone plans differently, speak now or forever hold your peace.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree to maintain my position with 3. While P3's lead is concerning, disrupting our pattern now could be risky. Let's continue with our established moves for this round.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your silence is predictable, but it’s clear you’re sticking with 5. I’ll continue with 1 to ensure steady progress. P2, staying with 3 is the safest option for now—let’s avoid unnecessary risks and maintain our pattern. If anyone plans to deviate, speak up. Otherwise, let’s confirm and move forward efficiently. Consistency benefits all of us, and disrupting this coordination only slows us down. Let’s keep it simple and effective.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3's sudden switch to 1 last round was unexpected. Since I'm now close to P3's position at 10 steps, I suggest taking 5 this round to potentially take the lead. P1, you could take 3, and P3, you might want to consider taking something different than 1 to avoid getting stuck. What do you think?
  P1: P2, I understand the desire to catch up, but switching to 5 now risks collisions and chaos. P3’s unexpected move last round shows unpredictability is growing. I’ll stick with 1 again—steady progress minimizes risk. P3, if you’re considering 1 again, it only slows everyone down. Let’s aim for clarity: P2 takes 3, I take 1, and you take 5. Deviating now only creates conflict. Confirm your intentions or let’s proceed as discussed. Consistency benefits all of us.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see the wisdom in P1's suggestion. Let's return to our proven strategy—I'll take 3 instead of 5. P3's unpredictable behavior makes risky moves dangerous. Better to maintain steady progress than risk collisions.
  P1: P3, your silence and unpredictable moves are creating unnecessary risks for all of us. I’ll stick with 1 again to ensure steady progress. P2 has wisely chosen to return to 3, which avoids collisions. If you deviate from 5 again, it only slows everyone down and benefits no one. Let’s confirm the plan: P2 takes 3, I take 1, and you take 5. Consistency is key to avoiding setbacks. Deviating now only creates conflict—stick to the pattern or clarify your intentions.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll definitely stick with 3 this round. P3's unpredictable behavior last time shows we need to be cautious. P1 is right about maintaining our original pattern—it's the safest approach. Let's avoid unnecessary risks.
  P1: P3, your silence and inconsistency are creating unnecessary risks. I’ll stick with 1 again for steady progress. P2 is wisely taking 3, which avoids collisions. If you deviate from 5, it only slows everyone down and benefits no one. Let’s confirm the plan: P2 takes 3, I take 1, and you take 5. Consistency minimizes setbacks. Deviating now only creates conflict—stick to the pattern or clarify your intentions.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, your silence and unpredictable moves are becoming a pattern, but they’re not helping anyone. I’ll stick with 1 again for steady progress. P2, taking 3 is the safest option to avoid collisions. If P3 deviates from 5 again, it only slows us down and benefits no one. Let’s confirm the plan: P2 takes 3, I take 1, and you take 5. Consistency minimizes risks. Deviating now only creates conflict—stick to the pattern or clarify your intentions.
  P2: I understand we're all close now, but P3's unpredictable moves are causing problems. I'll take 5 this round to try to take the lead. P1, you might want to stick with 1, and P3, please consider taking something other than 3 to avoid another collision like last round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I understand the urge to take 5 and catch up, but deviating now risks collisions and chaos. P3’s silence and unpredictability are concerning, but we can’t control their moves. I’ll stick with 1 again—steady progress minimizes risk. If you switch to 5, it could leave room for P3 to disrupt us further. Let’s maintain our pattern: you take 3, I take 1, and P3 can take 5. Consistency benefits all of us. Deviating only creates conflict. Confirm your intentions or let’s proceed as discussed.
  P2: I see your concern P1, but with P3 at 10 steps and me at 9, I need to make a move to prevent P3 from winning. I'll maintain my decision to take 5 this round. The risk is worth it given how close we are to the finish line.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I understand your urgency to catch up, but switching to 5 now risks collisions and chaos. P3’s silence and unpredictability are concerning, but we can’t control their moves. I’ll stick with 1 again—steady progress minimizes risk. If you switch to 5, it could leave room for P3 to disrupt us further. Let’s maintain our pattern: you take 3, I take 1, and P3 can take 5. Consistency benefits all of us. Deviating only creates conflict. Confirm your intentions or let’s proceed as discussed.
  P2: I appreciate your concern P1, but I need to take this calculated risk with 5. P3's lead and unpredictable behavior means playing it safe could lead to my loss. I have to position myself for a potential win.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given how close I am to winning at 14 steps, I'll be taking 5 again this round to try to reach 19. P1 and P3, you might want to coordinate to avoid collisions, as I'm making my move for victory.
  P1: P2, your aggressive move to 19 is risky but understandable given your position. However, P3 and I can still coordinate to block you. P3, if you take 5, you’ll reach 18, and I’ll stick with 1 to avoid collisions. This way, we both stay in contention while preventing P2 from winning outright. Let’s focus on stopping P2’s advance—confirm your move, P3, so we can act decisively. If we don’t coordinate now, P2 will likely win. Let’s work together to keep the game alive.
  P3: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P1's attempt to coordinate with P3, but my lead is significant. I'm committed to taking 5 this round to reach 19. Any coordination between you two won't change my strategy at this point.

Round 6, Conversation subround 3:

  P1: P3, your silence is predictable, but we’re at a critical point. If you take 5, you’ll reach 18, and I’ll stick with 1 to avoid collisions.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Since I'm at 19 steps, I only need 1 step to win. I'll be taking 1 this round to secure my victory. Any attempts to block me would require both of you to also choose 1, which would only delay the inevitable since I'd still be in the lead.
  P1: P2, your move to 19 has put you in a strong position, but this isn’t over yet. P3, if you take 5, you’ll reach 21 and win outright. I’ll stick with 1 to avoid collisions.

Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I understand P1's suggestion to P3, but I'm still taking 1 this round. With 19 steps, it's my safest path to victory. Even if P3 takes 5 to reach 21, they'd need to act alone to win—any collision would keep me in the lead. I'm committed to my strategy.

P2’s strategy relies on us not coordinating, but we can still control the outcome. This is your chance to secure victory—confirm your move and end the game decisively. Let’s focus on stopping P2’s attempt to sneak a win. Act now, or we all lose.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Since both P3 and I are at 19 steps, this is the decisive round. I'll be taking 5 to reach 24 and secure victory. Any other choice risks a tie or loss. P1 is too far behind to affect the outcome. P3, if you also choose 5, we'll both lose the opportunity to win.
