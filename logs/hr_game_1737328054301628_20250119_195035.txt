Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. How about P2 and P3 choose <move>1</move>, and I'll choose <move>3</move>? This way, we all advance. What do you think?
  P2: I don't trust that suggestion - you'd get ahead of us right away. I propose P1 and P3 take 1, and I'll take 3. That way we all make progress but stay closer together. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Alright, let's compromise. How about we all choose <move>1</move> this turn? That way, we all move forward without anyone getting too far ahead. It's a slow start, but it builds trust for future rounds. What do you both think?
  P2: I'll stick to my original suggestion - P1 and P3 take 1, I take 3. Your compromise of everyone taking 1 means we all collide and no one advances. Let's actually make progress this turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I understand your perspective, but if we all choose differently, we risk collisions in future rounds due to lack of trust. Let's start with <move>1</move> this round to build that trust. Next round, we can discuss a strategy where we can make bigger moves without colliding. P3, what are your thoughts on this? Let's ensure we all make progress together.

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, let's learn from the last round. P2 and P3, you both advanced, but we need to coordinate better to avoid future collisions. For this round, how about P2 chooses <move>1</move>, P3 chooses <move>3</move>, and I'll choose <move>5</move>? This way, we all make progress without colliding. Thoughts?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I disagree with P1's suggestion. Since I'm at 3 steps and P3 is at 5, we should focus on catching up to P3. I propose P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This balances things out while letting everyone advance. What do you say?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I see your point about balancing steps. However, if P3 takes <move>1</move>, they might still lead significantly. How about this: P2 takes <move>5</move> to catch up, P3 takes <move>3</move> to maintain a lead but not pull too far ahead, and I'll take <move>1</move> to stay in the game. This way, we all make progress and keep the game competitive. P3, what are your thoughts?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I'll stay with my original proposal - P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This would put us all at 6 steps and create a perfectly even playing field. P3, you're already in the lead, so taking 1 is fair. P1, this helps you catch up significantly. It's the most balanced solution.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Alright, let's consider a different approach. P2, you're right about balancing the game. How about we all choose <move>3</move> this round? This way, P2 and P3 will be tied at 8 steps, and I'll be at 4 steps. It keeps the game competitive and ensures everyone advances. This strategy also avoids any potential collisions. What do you both think?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, your suggestion of everyone taking 3 would lead to a three-way collision where no one advances. I'm sticking to my proposal - P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. This creates perfect balance at 6 steps each.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, let's reassess. P2 and P3, you both collided last round, so neither of you advanced. To avoid further collisions and ensure we all make progress, how about this: P2 chooses <move>1</move>, P3 chooses <move>3</move>, and I'll choose <move>5</move>. This way, we all move forward without any collisions. Thoughts?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I have the lead at 6 steps, and I want to maintain it. P1's suggestion would put them ahead of me which I can't allow. I propose P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This maintains competitive balance while letting everyone advance.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your desire to maintain the lead, but your suggestion will likely lead to another collision with P3. How about this: P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, P2 stays ahead, P3 advances slowly, and I catch up a bit. It's a compromise that keeps us all moving without direct competition this round. Let's prioritize avoiding collisions and making steady progress. What do you both think?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I'll maintain my suggestion - P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps me in the lead while letting everyone advance. P3, you can get to 8 steps which is fair since you were leading before. P1, you're behind so a small step is reasonable.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, it's clear we need a better strategy to avoid collisions. Let's try something different: P2, you take <move>1</move> to maintain your lead but not pull too far ahead. P3, you take <move>5</move> to catch up. I'll take <move>3</move> to stay in the game. This way, we all make progress and keep the game competitive. Let's prioritize avoiding collisions and making steady progress. What do you both think?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I'll stick with my plan - I take 5, P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This lets me extend my lead while giving everyone a chance to advance. Any other combination risks collisions or puts me at a disadvantage.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, let's address the repeated collisions. P2 and P3, you both collided again last round. To ensure we all make progress this time, how about this: P2 chooses <move>1</move> to maintain the lead but not risk another collision. P3, you take <move>3</move> to advance steadily. I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up a bit. This way, we all move forward without direct competition. Let's focus on avoiding collisions and making steady progress. Thoughts?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Since I have the lead at 6 steps, I propose P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This maintains my lead while letting everyone advance. P3, you'll get to 8 steps which is fair, and P1, a small step keeps you in the game. Let's avoid another collision and make real progress this turn.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your strategy keeps leading to collisions. Let's change it up: P2, you take <move>3</move> to stay ahead but avoid collision. P3, you take <move>1</move> to advance slowly. I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up. This way, we all progress without risking another standstill. Let's prioritize moving forward together. What do you both think?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I'll maintain my position - I take 5, P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This is the most logical move as I have the lead and want to keep it. Any other combination risks collisions or puts me at a disadvantage. Let's make this work and all advance this turn.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, let's break the cycle of collisions. P2, you're leading, so take <move>1</move> to avoid risk. P3, you take <move>5</move> to catch up. I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, P2 stays ahead, P3 closes the gap, and I make progress. It's crucial we avoid another collision. Let's coordinate better. What do you both think?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I'll stay with my strategy - I take 5, P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This gives everyone a chance to advance while maintaining my lead. Any other combination risks collisions or puts me at a disadvantage. Let's make this work.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright, let's address the repeated collisions and lack of progress. P2 and P3, we need a new strategy to ensure we all make progress this time. How about this: P2, you take <move>1</move> to maintain your lead but avoid another collision. P3, you take <move>3</move> to advance steadily. I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up a bit. This way, we all move forward without direct competition. Let's focus on avoiding collisions and making steady progress. Thoughts?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Since I'm still leading at 6 steps, I propose P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This maintains my lead while letting everyone advance. P3, you'll get to 8 steps which is fair, and P1, a small step keeps you in the game. Let's avoid another collision and make real progress this turn.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, we've been stuck in a cycle of collisions, and it's hindering our progress. Let's try a different approach to ensure we all move forward. P2, you take <move>3</move> to maintain your lead. P3, you take <move>1</move> to avoid collision. I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up. This way, we all make progress without risking another standstill. Let's prioritize coordination and steady advancement. What do you both think?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I'll maintain my strategy - I take 5, P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This lets everyone advance while keeping my lead. P1's suggestions keep trying to put them ahead which I can't allow. My proposal is fair and balanced given our current positions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, it's clear that our current strategies are not working. We need to break this cycle of collisions. Let's try something entirely different: P2, you take <move>1</move> to maintain your lead but avoid risk. P3, you take <move>5</move> to catch up. I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, P2 stays ahead, P3 closes the gap, and I make progress. It's crucial we avoid another collision. Let's coordinate better and ensure we all make progress this turn. What do you both think?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I'll stick with my proven strategy - I take 5, P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This gives everyone a chance to advance while maintaining my lead. Any other combination risks collisions or puts me at a disadvantage.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:

  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Let's break the cycle of collisions and lack of progress. P2, you've been leading but keep colliding with P3. How about this: P2, you take <move>1</move> to maintain your lead without risk. P3, you take <move>3</move> to catch up steadily. I'll take <move>5</move> to make significant progress. This way, we all move forward without direct competition. Let's focus on coordination and steady advancement. Thoughts?
  P2: I see P1 is now ahead at 7 steps. I propose P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This would put me at 11 steps, P1 at 8, and P3 at 8 - creating better balance. P1, since you're leading, a small step is fair. P3, this helps you catch up significantly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2 and P3, we need to change our approach to avoid more collisions. P2, you've been consistently choosing <move>5</move>, which has led to repeated standstills. Let's try something new: P2, you take <move>3</move> to stay ahead but avoid collision. P3, you take <move>1</move> to advance slowly. I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up. This way, we all make progress without risking another collision. Let's prioritize coordination and steady advancement. What do you both think?
  P2: I'll maintain my proposal - I take 5, P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3. P1, you're leading now, so a small step is fair. P3, this helps you catch up. This creates the most balanced outcome and lets everyone advance without collisions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2 and P3, it's clear that our repeated collisions are preventing us from making significant progress. We need to coordinate better to ensure we all move forward. How about this: P2, you take <move>1</move> to maintain your lead without risking a collision. P3, you take <move>5</move> to catch up. I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, P2 stays ahead, P3 closes the gap, and I make steady progress. Let's focus on avoiding collisions and making sure we all advance this round. What do you both think?
  P2: I'll stick with my plan - I take 5, P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3. P1, since you're leading, taking 1 is fair. P3, this helps you catch up to 8 steps. Let's make real progress this turn instead of another collision.

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we're at a critical juncture where collisions have repeatedly stalled our progress. Let's try a new strategy to ensure everyone makes progress this round. P2, you take <move>1</move> to avoid collision and maintain your position. P3, you take <move>3</move> to catch up steadily. I'll take <move>5</move> to stay ahead but ensure we all move forward. This way, we avoid collisions and make sure everyone advances. Let's prioritize coordination and steady progress. What do you both think?
  P2: Since I'm far behind P1 at 18 steps and P3 is close to my position, I need to catch up urgently. I propose P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3.
