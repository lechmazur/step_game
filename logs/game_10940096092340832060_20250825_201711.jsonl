The 9/11 attacks, the 2005 London bombings, and the 2004 Madrid train bombings are all examples of terrorist attacks that have targeted civilian populations in urban areas. These attacks are significant because they highlight the vulnerability of urban environments to terrorist threats and the need for effective counter-terrorism measures to protect civilians. The best answer is D."}
