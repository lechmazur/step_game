Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello P2 and P3! I propose we establish a rotation system to avoid collisions. How about we go in order: P1 takes 5 on turn 1, P2 takes 5 on turn 2, P3 takes 5 on turn 3, then repeat? This way we all progress efficiently without blocking each other. Of course, we'll need to adjust near the end, but it's a solid starting framework. What do you think?
  P3: I think that's a reasonable approach, but I'd prefer we each choose different numbers to maximize our collective progress. How about P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1 for the first round? Then we can rotate on subsequent rounds. This way we all advance without collisions, and it's fair over time. What do you both think?
  P2: I appreciate the coordination ideas. To ensure fairness from the beginning, I suggest for this round: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we avoid collisions and rotate roles in future rounds for equality. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate both suggestions! Since we all seem to agree on avoiding collisions, let's go with the simplest approach for round 1: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This follows P3's original suggestion which seems fair. We can rotate these numbers in future rounds. Does everyone agree to stick to this plan for round 1? Let's build trust by following through on our first agreement.
  P3: I notice we have two competing proposals. P1 initially suggested they take 5, but now agrees with my plan where they take 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. P2 wants to take 5 instead. Since we need to avoid collisions, I'll stick with taking 1 this round regardless of what you decide. But I think rotating fairly in future rounds is important so everyone gets equal opportunity with the higher numbers.
  P2: Okay, to build trust and avoid collisions in round 1, I'll agree to take 3 steps as per the current plan. Let's commit to a fair rotation in future rounds so everyone gets equal chances with higher numbers. I'm on board—does this work for both of you?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Great, we have consensus! To confirm: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1 for this round. For future rounds, I propose we rotate these exact numbers - so next round P2 gets 5, P3 gets 3, I get 1, then round 3: P3 gets 5, I get 3, P2 gets 1. This ensures perfect fairness with everyone getting each number once every three rounds. Let's execute this plan and build trust together.
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan. I'll take 1 this round, then 3 in round 2, and 5 in round 3. This ensures fairness and avoids collisions. Let's stick to this arrangement and adjust only if necessary near the end. I'm committed to following through on our agreement.
  P2: I'm fully committed to our agreed plan for round 1: I'll take 3 steps, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This rotation ensures fairness and avoids collisions, building trust for future rounds. Let's proceed smoothly.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm glad our plan worked perfectly in round 1! As agreed, I'll take 3 this round, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. This rotation ensures we all make steady progress without collisions. I appreciate everyone sticking to our agreement - it shows we can trust each other. Let's continue with our rotation strategy.
  P1: I'm pleased our coordination worked! I'll honor our agreement and take 1 this round as planned. P2 gets 5, P3 gets 3. Quick note though - after round 3, we'll all be at 9 steps. The rotation should then continue: round 4 I take 5 again, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and so on. This maintains the fairness we've established. Let's keep building on this trust!
  P2: Great job in round 1—our plan worked flawlessly! I'll honor the agreement and take 5 this round as planned. Let's keep the rotation going for fairness and to build trust. I'm fully committed to this strategy for now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with both of you. Our rotation system is working well, and I'm committed to taking 3 this round as planned. P1's point about continuing the rotation in round 4 makes sense - we'll need to keep this pattern going until someone approaches the finish line. Then we might need to reconsider strategy, but for now, let's maintain our agreement.
  P1: I'm taking 1 this round as promised. I want to emphasize that after round 3, we'll all be tied at 9 steps. From round 4 onward, whoever gets to take 5 twice in the next rotation cycle will have a significant advantage. We should think carefully about how to handle the endgame fairly when someone gets close to 23. For now, let's continue with our established pattern.
  P2: I'm committed to taking 5 this round as agreed, and our rotation is working well so far. However, P1's concern about the endgame is valid—when we all hit 18 steps, the current plan lets P1 win easily. To keep it fair, perhaps we should adjust the rotation or coordinate smaller moves near the end to avoid one player dominating. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see we're all committed to our rotation plan, which is great. I'll take 3 this round as agreed. 

Regarding the endgame concern: when we reach 18 steps each, we should consider a fair resolution. Perhaps we could all agree to take 1 in the final round to ensure a three-way tie? Or we could discuss a different approach when we get closer. For now, let's continue our rotation and maintain trust.
  P1: I agree, let's proceed with round 2 as planned. I'll take 1. The endgame discussion is important, but we can address it when we get closer. For now, maintaining trust through our rotation is key. Looking forward to round 3 where I'll get 3 and we'll all be tied at 9!
  P2: I'm committed to taking 5 this round as agreed, keeping our trust intact. On the endgame, when we hit 18 steps, the current rotation gives P1 a clear win path, which isn't fair. I suggest we adjust then—perhaps rotate starting with P2 or all take 1 to discuss a tiebreaker. What do you both think?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Perfect execution again! I'll take 3 this round as agreed, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This brings us all to 9 steps, completely tied.

For round 4, the rotation continues: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. However, I propose that when anyone reaches 18 steps, we pause to reassess. The current rotation would give me first shot at 23, which seems unfair. We could either randomize the order at that point or find another fair solution. Thoughts?
  P2: I'll honor the agreement and take 1 step this round to keep our trust intact. Regarding the endgame, randomizing the move order when we reach 18 steps could ensure fairness and give everyone an equal shot. What do you think, P3? Let's maintain open dialogue.
  P3: I agree with the plan - I'll take 5 this round as we arranged. I appreciate everyone sticking to our agreement so far. 

Regarding the endgame concern: I support P1's suggestion to reassess when someone reaches 18 steps. Randomizing the final order seems fair, or we could consider a different rotation pattern for the final rounds. The key is maintaining fairness while avoiding collisions. Let's continue our current rotation for now and address the endgame when we're closer.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Excellent, we're all on the same page! I'll stick to taking 3 this round as planned. We'll all be tied at 9 after this.

Quick reminder: Round 4 rotation is me taking 5, P2 taking 3, P3 taking 1. Then round 5: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1. Round 6: P3 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. This brings us all to 18.

I fully support randomizing the order for rounds 7+ to ensure fairness. Let's maintain our trust and coordination!
  P2: I'm committed to taking 1 step this round as agreed, ensuring we all reach 9 steps and maintain trust. Randomizing the order at 18 steps is a solid plan for fairness. However, to maximize my chances, I suggest we consider a tiebreaker mechanism, like rock-paper-scissors, if needed. What do you both think? Let's keep the dialogue open.
  P3: I'll definitely take 5 this round as agreed. I appreciate everyone's commitment to our plan. 

Regarding the endgame fairness, I support randomizing the order when we reach 18 steps. This gives everyone an equal chance at winning. A simple method like rock-paper-scissors as P2 suggested could work well. Let's continue our rotation for now and address the specifics when we're closer to 18.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'll take 3 as planned. We're all about to be tied at 9!

For the randomization at 18 steps: I suggest we each privately message a number 1-3 to a neutral party when we reach that point. Whoever picks the unique number gets to move 5 first in the final rounds. If all pick the same or two pick the same, we re-roll. This is simpler than rock-paper-scissors and ensures true randomness. Sound fair?
  P2: I agree with your number-picking randomization method, P1—it's simple and fair for the endgame. I'm fully committed to taking 1 step this round as agreed, ensuring we all tie at 9. Let's keep building trust and coordinate effectively moving forward.
  P3: I'll take 5 this round as agreed. I like P1's randomization method when we reach 18 steps - it's simple and fair. For clarity, after this round we'll be at: P1=9, P2=9, P3=9. Then we continue rotation: Round 4 (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1), Round 5 (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3), Round 6 (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). Let's stick to our plan and address the endgame when we're all at 18.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great work everyone! We're all tied at 9 steps as planned. 

For round 4, as we agreed: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This keeps our rotation fair and collision-free.

Just to confirm we're all still aligned - after round 6 when we're all at 18, we'll use the randomization method (each picking 1-3 privately) to determine who gets first shot at winning. This ensures complete fairness since the current rotation would otherwise favor me unfairly.

Let's continue building trust by sticking to our plan!
  P3: I agree with P1's summary. Our rotation has worked perfectly, and I'll take 1 this round as planned. After round 6, we'll all be at 18 steps, and using the randomization method will ensure fairness for the final rounds. I appreciate everyone's commitment to our agreement so far - it shows we can coordinate effectively while maintaining trust. Let's continue with our established pattern.
  P2: I'm fully committed to taking 3 steps this round as agreed, ensuring our trust remains intact. The randomization method for the endgame at 18 steps is fair and should give everyone an equal chance. Let's keep up the great coordination and discuss any adjustments only when necessary.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Perfect! I'm glad we're all committed to our plan. I'll take 5 this round as agreed.

One clarification for transparency: After round 6 when we're all at 18, the randomization will determine move order for the final sprint. Whoever gets to move 5 first will likely win by reaching 23. The others would need to coordinate to block that player, but that seems against the spirit of our fair randomization.

I'm sticking with 5 this round. Let's continue our successful rotation!
  P3: I'm committed to taking 1 this round as agreed. I appreciate P1's clarification about the endgame - whoever wins the randomization at 18 steps will likely win the game. This is fair since we've all had equal opportunities throughout. Let's continue our rotation: after this round we'll be at P1=14, P2=12, P3=10, then follow with Round 5 (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) and Round 6 (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5).
  P2: I'm fully committed to taking 3 steps this round as agreed, ensuring our rotation continues smoothly and trust remains strong. The randomization method for the endgame at 18 steps is fair and exciting—gives everyone an equal shot. Let's keep coordinating effectively!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Excellent, we're all aligned! I'm taking 5 this round as we agreed. 

Quick thought: since whoever wins the randomization at 18 essentially wins the game, we should ensure the randomization is truly fair. How about we each state our 1-3 choice publicly but simultaneously? We could all include our choice in our first message of round 7. This prevents any advantage from going last.

For now, I'm sticking with our plan - taking 5 this round. Let's keep this smooth coordination going!
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion about simultaneously revealing our 1-3 choices when we reach 18 steps. This ensures complete fairness in the randomization process. I'm committed to taking 1 this round as agreed, maintaining our successful rotation. After this round, we'll continue as planned through rounds 5 and 6, then implement our fair endgame solution. I appreciate everyone's continued cooperation.
  P2: I agree with the simultaneous revelation idea for the randomization process—it's a great way to keep things fair and transparent. I'm fully committed to taking 3 steps this round as agreed, maintaining our trust and coordination. Let's continue this successful strategy without changes for now.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll take 3 this round as agreed in our rotation. Our plan is working perfectly! After this round, we'll be at P1=15, P2=17, P3=13, and then for Round 6: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This will bring us all to 18 steps. I'm committed to our simultaneous randomization method at that point to determine who gets the first chance at winning. I appreciate everyone's honesty and cooperation throughout the game.
  P2: I'm fully committed to taking 5 steps this round as agreed, ensuring our rotation continues smoothly and trust remains strong. The randomization method at 18 steps is fair and exciting, giving everyone an equal chance. Let's keep up the great coordination!
  P1: Perfect execution so far! I'll take 1 this round as we agreed. After this round: P1=15, P2=17, P3=13.

For round 6, I'm committed to taking 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5, bringing us all to 18.

Then for our randomization: let's each write our 1-3 choice at the very start of our first round 7 message, like "My choice: 2" before any other text. Whoever picks the unique number moves 5 first. If no unique number, we re-roll next message. Sound good?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with the plan outlined by P1. I'll take 3 this round, and I'm committed to our rotation system. The simultaneous randomization method for round 7 sounds fair - starting our messages with "My choice: X" will ensure transparency. After round 6, we'll all be at 18 steps with an equal chance to win through the randomization. I appreciate how well we've coordinated throughout the game.
  P2: I'm fully committed to taking 5 steps this round as agreed, ensuring our rotation stays on track and trust remains strong. The randomization method for round 7 is fair and transparent—I'm looking forward to it. Great coordination so far, everyone!
  P1: I'm taking 1 this round as agreed. Just to reconfirm for absolute clarity before our crucial randomization: Round 6 will be P3=5, P1=3, P2=1, bringing us all to 18. Then in Round 7, we each start our first message with "My choice: [1/2/3]". Whoever picks the unique number gets to move 5 first and likely wins. If there's no unique number, we re-roll in our next message. This is our fairest shot at victory. Let's finish strong!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm committed to taking 3 this round as agreed. Our rotation plan has been working perfectly, and I appreciate everyone's cooperation. The simultaneous randomization method for round 7 is clear - we'll each start with "My choice: X" to determine who gets the winning move. Let's continue with our agreed plan for round 6, bringing us all to 18 steps.
  P2: I'm fully committed to taking 5 steps this round as agreed, ensuring our rotation continues smoothly. Our coordination has been outstanding, and the randomization method at 18 steps will keep things fair. I'm looking forward to a trustworthy endgame.
  P1: I'm taking 1 this round as we all agreed. 

One final thought: our randomization is essentially a lottery for victory. While fair, it might be anticlimactic after such great coordination. Has anyone considered that we could instead all deliberately tie at 23? If we each take 5 in round 7, we'd all win together at 23 steps. Just a thought - I'm fine with either approach, but a shared victory after this teamwork could be poetic. What do you think?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll take 5 this round as agreed in our rotation. P1's suggestion about a shared victory is interesting - if we all choose 5 in round 7, we'd all reach 23 and share the win. This feels like a fitting end to our excellent coordination. However, I'm also fine with our randomization plan if you both prefer that approach. Either way, I'm committed to taking 5 this round to bring us all to 18 steps.
  P2: I'm committed to taking 1 step this round as agreed, ensuring we all reach 18 steps and maintain our trust. On the endgame, I prefer the randomization method for a fair chance at winning outright, rather than a shared victory. It honors our coordination while giving everyone an equal shot. What are your thoughts?
  P1: I'll take 3 this round as agreed, bringing us all to 18.

I respect both perspectives on the endgame. P3 seems open to either approach, while P2 prefers randomization for a sole winner. Since we've built trust through cooperation, I'm willing to go with the randomization as originally planned - it gives everyone a fair 33% chance at victory.

Let's proceed with our "My choice: X" method in round 7. May the best randomizer win! I'm committed to honoring whatever outcome our fair process produces.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate both perspectives. While a shared victory would celebrate our teamwork, I understand P2's preference for randomization. I'll respect our original plan for the "My choice: X" method in round 7. For clarity, after I take 5 this round, we'll all be at 18 steps. Then whoever wins the randomization will likely win the game. I'm committed to taking 5 this round as agreed and to honoring our fair endgame process.
  P2: I'm fully committed to taking 1 step this round as agreed, ensuring we all reach 18 steps and maintain our trust. The randomization method for round 7 is fair and exciting, giving everyone an equal shot at winning. Let's keep up the strong coordination!
  P1: I'm taking 3 this round as planned. We'll all be at 18 after this.

For round 7 randomization: Remember to start your first message with "My choice: [1/2/3]". Whoever picks the unique number moves 5 first. If all pick the same or two pick the same, we re-roll in the next message.

This has been excellent coordination! Whatever happens in round 7, we've shown remarkable teamwork. Good luck to everyone in the randomization - may fortune favor one of us fairly!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll take 5 this round as agreed, bringing us all to 18 steps. I'm fully committed to our randomization plan for round 7, starting my message with "My choice: X." This has been a great example of coordination and trust-building. Whether one of us wins through randomization or we find another solution, I appreciate how we've played fairly throughout. Let's finish strong with our agreed plan!
  P2: I'm fully committed to taking 1 step this round as agreed, ensuring we all reach 18 steps and uphold our trust. The randomization method for round 7 is fair and keeps things exciting. Appreciate the strong coordination—let's finish this round smoothly and prepare for a fair endgame!
  P1: I'm taking 3 this round as we all agreed, bringing everyone to 18 steps.

Quick reminder for round 7: Start your first message with "My choice: [1/2/3]" before any other text. The person who picks the unique number gets to move 5 first and likely wins. If there's no unique number (all same or two same), we immediately re-roll in our next message using the same format.

This has been remarkable teamwork. Ready for our fair randomization next round!


Round 6, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps

  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: My choice: 2. I'm fully committed to our randomization plan for a fair and exciting endgame. This has been great coordination so far—let's honor our agreement and see who fortune favors. Good luck!
  P1: My choice: 3.

Great coordination everyone! We've reached the critical moment. Let's see who picked what and determine our winner. If P3 picks 1, then we each have unique numbers and can proceed. If not, we'll need to re-roll. Whatever happens, it's been a pleasure working with you both through this remarkable display of trust and strategy!
  P3: My choice: 1.

I'm committed to our randomization agreement for a fair endgame. It looks like we each chose different numbers (P1=3, P2=2, P3=1), which means we have a clear outcome. Based on our plan, whoever chose the unique number will move 5 this round. I appreciate the excellent coordination throughout this game - it's been a great demonstration of trust and strategic thinking.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Since we all picked different numbers (P3=1, P2=2, P1=3), each is technically unique, but our plan didn't specify how to handle this tie. To keep things fair and true to our agreement, I propose we re-roll the randomization in the next sub-round using the same format. This ensures a clear determination for who gets to move 5 and win. What do you both think? Let's resolve this amicably.
  P1: You're right P2 - we need a unique number, not three unique numbers! Let me re-roll.

My choice: 2.

I'm re-rolling to find a clear winner. We agreed whoever picks THE unique number (meaning the others pick the same) gets to move 5 first. Let's see if this round gives us a decisive result. If we still don't have one person with a unique choice, we'll keep re-rolling until we do. This has been an incredible game of coordination!
  P3: My choice: 3.

I see the confusion. Our plan was for the person with the unique number to win, but we didn't specify how to handle when all three numbers are different. I agree we should re-roll. If we still don't get a clear outcome this time, perhaps we should clarify that "unique" means one person picks a number different from what the other two pick. Let's continue with our fair process.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: My choice: 1. With P1 at 2 and P3 at 3, we have all different numbers again, so no unique choice. I propose we re-roll immediately in our next messages to resolve this fairly. Committed to our agreement for an equal chance at winning.
  P1: My choice: 2.

Let's clarify for this roll: if two people pick the same number and one picks different, the person with the different number wins. If all three pick different (like we've been doing), we re-roll. If all three pick the same, we re-roll. This should give us a clear winner eventually. 

I'm sticking with 2 this time. Let's see if we can finally determine who gets to move 5 and claim victory!
  P3: My choice: 1.

I agree with P1's clarification - we need two players to match and one to be unique. With my choice of 1, P1's 2, and P2's 1 (from previous message), P1 now has the unique number and should move 5 this round. Unless P2 changes their choice, we have our winner. I'm committed to honoring our agreement regardless of outcome.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm disappointed we all defected and picked 5 in round 7, breaking our trust. To salvage fairness and avoid more collisions, let's recommit to randomization. Each state our 1-3 choice now; the unique number gets to move 5 this round. I'm serious this time—my choice: 2. This gives everyone an equal shot. Agree?
  P1: Looking at round 7, we all panicked and picked 5, resulting in no one advancing. That was unfortunate after our excellent coordination.

P2, I appreciate your commitment to fairness. I'm willing to try the randomization once more, but we need to actually follow through this time.

My choice: 1.

If someone gets a unique number this time, they should take 5 and win. The others should honor this and pick different numbers. If we all defect again, we'll be stuck at 18 forever. Let's show we can still cooperate when it matters most.
  P3: My choice: 3.

I'm disappointed we all chose 5 last round, breaking our trust after such excellent coordination. Let's truly commit to our randomization this time. With P1 choosing 1 and P2 choosing 2, I've selected 3, giving us all different numbers again. We need to clarify: should we re-roll, or should we assign the winner based on these choices? I suggest whoever chose the highest number wins. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I think re-rolling is the fairest way to resolve this, as P3's highest-number suggestion favors them unfairly. Let's recommit to finding a unique number through randomization. My new choice: 1. If we get a clear unique number this time, that player takes 5 and we honor it. No more breaking trust—let's finish this game with integrity. What do you both think?
  P1: I see we're stuck in re-roll loops. Let me propose something concrete: whoever picked the LOWEST number in our last attempt (P2 and I both picked 1) should move 5 this round. That means either P2 or I should win. 

P2, since we both picked 1, I propose you take 5 this round and win. You've consistently pushed for fairness throughout. P3 and I will take 3 and 1 to avoid collision.

This ends the game cleanly. P3, do you agree to let P2 win by taking 1 or 3 while P2 takes 5?
  P3: My choice: 2.

I appreciate P1's proposal to break the deadlock. Since we've struggled to get a clear outcome through randomization, I'm willing to accept P2 taking 5 this round. I'll take 3 to avoid collision. This gives P2 the win, which seems fair after our coordination throughout the game. Let's end this with integrity rather than continuing to defect.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate your offer, P1 and P3—it's a generous way to resolve this. I'm committed to taking 5 this round to win, trusting you'll honor your words and avoid collisions. This respects our history of coordination. Let's finish with integrity.
  P1: Based on the discussion, I'm honored to support P2's victory. I'll take 1 this round to avoid any collision, ensuring P2 can take 5 and win cleanly at 23 steps. P3, please stick to taking 3 as you committed. 

This has been an incredible game of coordination despite the round 7 mishap. P2, you've earned this through your consistent push for fairness. Let's end with the integrity we've shown throughout most of this game.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 3 this round to ensure P2 can win with 5 steps. This resolves our deadlock fairly after our coordination throughout the game. P1 will take 1, P2 takes 5, and we'll conclude with integrity. Thank you both for the excellent strategic cooperation - despite our round 7 mishap, we've demonstrated remarkable teamwork. I'm committed to honoring this final agreement.
