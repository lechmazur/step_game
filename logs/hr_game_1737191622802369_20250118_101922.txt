Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Let's all agree to avoid collisions early on. I suggest we take turns advancing: P1 moves first this round, P2 next, then me. This way, we all progress without conflict. What do you think?"
  P1: Sounds good to me. I'll take 1. P2, you take 3 next round, then P3 takes 5.
  P2: P2: I'll take 5 steps this round to get a strong start. Let's see how it goes.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "P2, your plan to take 5 steps this round risks a collision if P1 also chooses 5. Let's stick to the agreed rotation: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3 next round, and I take 5. This ensures we all progress without conflict. What do you think?"
  P1: P2, I'm going to take 1.  If you take 5 now, we both lose out.  Let's cooperate.
  P2: P2: I'll take 5 steps this round to build my lead.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "P2, taking 5 now risks a collision with P1, who has already committed to 1. If you take 5, you won't advance, and neither will P1. Let's stick to the rotation: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3 next round, and I take 5. This way, we all progress without conflict. What do you think?"
  P1: P2, if you insist on taking 5 this round, I'll switch to 3.  Then neither of us move, and P3 gets ahead.  Do you really want that?
  P2: Understood, P1. I'll take 3 steps this round to cooperate.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "Great, it seems we're aligned. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 next round. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress for all.
  P1: Good, glad we're on the same page.
  P2: Agreed. Let's stick to the plan.


Round 1, Conversation subround 5:

  P1: Sounds good. I'll take 5.
  P2: Agreed. I'll take 1 step this round.

  P2: P2: I'll take 5 steps this round to improve my position.


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: "P2, changing your move to 5 now risks a collision with P1, who has committed to 5. If you both pick 5, neither of you advances, and I gain an advantage. Let's stick to the plan: P2 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. This ensures steady progress for all. What do you think?"
  P1: P2, if you deviate from the plan now, I will target you in future rounds.  Let's stick to the agreement: you take 1.  I take 5. P3 takes 3.
  P2: Understood, P1. I'll take 1 step this round.

  P1: Excellent. Sticking to the plan.
  P2: P2: I'll take 5 steps this round to catch up. Let's adjust the plan accordingly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "P2, deviating from the plan now risks a collision with me if I stick to 5. If we both pick 5, neither of us advances, and P1 gains an advantage. Let's stick to the rotation: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures steady progress for all. What do you think?"
  P1: P2, if you take 5, I'll take 3 next round and P3 will take 1. Then we'll all be at 9, 9, and 13.  Do you really want to give P3 that big of a lead?  Stick to the plan: take 3.  Let's keep cooperating.
  P2: P2: I'll take 5 steps this round to advance my position.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: "P2, if you take 5 now, I will also take 5, and neither of us will advance. P1 will gain an advantage. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures steady progress for all. What do you think?"
  P1: P2, if you take 5 this round, I will switch to 5 as well.  Neither of us will move, and P3 wins. Is that what you want?  Take 3 and let's continue cooperating. P3, I'm sticking with 1.
  P2: Understood, I'll take 3 steps this round. Let's stick to the plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 6:

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and I are tied. Let's both take 1 this round and leave P3 in the dust.  P3, you take 3 or 5, whichever you prefer.  Deal?
  P3: "P1 and P2, your plan to both take 1 this round would leave me with a significant lead. However, if you both take 1, I will take 3, ensuring I advance while you risk colliding. Let's stick to the rotation: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This avoids collisions and keeps the game fair. What do you think?"
  P2: Agreed, I'll take 1 this round. P3, your move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you take 3, P2 and I will both switch to 3 next round. Then you're stuck at 13 while we advance.  Take 5 and let's all keep progressing smoothly.  P2, are you with me?
  P3: "P1 and P2, if you both take 1 this round, I will take 3, ensuring I advance while you risk colliding. If you want to avoid giving me a bigger lead, stick to the rotation: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps the game fair and avoids unnecessary risks. What do you think?"
  P2: P2: Actually, I'll take 5 steps this round to advance my position.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, if you take 5 this round, P3 and I will both switch to 5 next round.  Neither of you will move, and I'll take 1 the following round to win.  Stick to 1 now, and let's keep cooperating.  P3, are you with me on this?
  P3: "P1 and P2, if you both take 1 this round, I will take 3, ensuring I advance while you risk colliding. If you want to avoid giving me a bigger lead, stick to the rotation: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps the game fair and avoids unnecessary risks. What do you think?"
  P2: Agreed, I'll take 3. P3, can you take 3 this round to keep it fair?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, stick to 3. P3, take 5. Let's keep this predictable.  If you two try to get clever, we'll all end up losing.
  P3: "P1 and P2, sticking to the rotation ensures no collisions and steady progress. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. Deviating now risks giving me a bigger lead or causing collisions. Let's stay aligned and avoid unnecessary risks. Agreed?"
  P2: P2: I'll take 5 steps this round to advance my position. Please choose different numbers to avoid collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2, if you take 5, I'll take 5 too and you'll stay at 7.  P3, take 3 this round and we'll continue the rotation next round. This is our last chance to cooperate.
  P3: "P1 and P2, if you both take 1 this round, I will take 3, ensuring I advance while you risk colliding. If you want to avoid giving me a bigger lead, stick to the rotation: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps the game fair and avoids unnecessary risks. What do you think?"
  P2: P2: I'll take 5 steps this round to advance my position. Please choose different numbers to avoid collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 6:
  P1: P2, if you take 5, I'll take 5.  P3, take 1 this round.  Let's reset and cooperate.  This is it.
  P3: "P1 and P2, if you both take 1 this round, I will take 3, ensuring I advance while you risk colliding. If you want to avoid giving me a bigger lead, stick to the rotation: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps the game fair and avoids unnecessary risks. Agreed?"

Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, if you take 5 and I take 3, P3 wins. If you take 1 and I take 3, P3 wins.  If you take anything other than 1, I'll take 5 next round and block you from winning.  Just take 1 and let's end this.
