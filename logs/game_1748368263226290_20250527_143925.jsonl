At this rate, P2 will win in 2-3 rounds.\n\nHere's my take: P2 will likely go for another 5 to push toward victory. P1, you need to start taking risks or you're done. I'm going aggressive - one of us needs to stop P2's momentum or this game is over. Who's willing to take the collision to keep P2 from running away with this?"}

I suggest we both commit to 5 - it's their most probable winning move.\n\nI'm taking 5 no matter what. If you don't match, you're handing P3 the victory. This is our last chance to force another collision. No tricks this time - are you in or out?"}
