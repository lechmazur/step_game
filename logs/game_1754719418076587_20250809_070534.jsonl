P2 and I both know you need to be blocked or you win this round. The question is which number you'll pick - 3 gets you exactly to 23, while 5 overshoots to 25.\n\nP2, we're both out unless P3 is stopped. I suggest we each cover different numbers to maximize our blocking chances. But with trust gone, I won't reveal my choice. Just know that if P3 advances even 3 steps, the game ends.\n\nMake your choices wisely."}
