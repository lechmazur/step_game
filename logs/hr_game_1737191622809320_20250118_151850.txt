Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey everyone! I suggest we each pick different numbers to avoid collisions. Maybe we can coordinate? I'm happy to take any number you both prefer I choose.
  P1: I agree with P3 that coordinating to avoid collisions would be beneficial. How about we assign numbers based on our player order? I'll take 1, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we all move forward in the first round.
  P2: P1, P3, I'm okay with the plan for this round. Let's stick to it and see how it goes.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm happy with that plan - I'll take 5 for this round.
  P1: Now that we have a plan for this round, let's stick to it. I'll choose 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. This should give us all a good starting position.
  P2: P1, P3, I'm glad we're on the same page for this round. Let's stick to the plan and see how it works out.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great start, everyone. Should we continue with the same plan for this round to keep moving forward without collisions? Let me know if you have any other ideas or if we're sticking to the same numbers.
  P3: Since I'm in the lead, I expect you might target me now. I'm willing to change my number this round if we want to rotate - what do you both think?
  P1: Let's stick with the original plan for this round as well. No need to change what's working, and we can reassess after this round if needed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, since you're in the lead, it might be beneficial for you to switch numbers to avoid being targeted. How about you take 3, I take 5, and P1 sticks with 1 for this round? This way, we keep avoiding collisions. Let me know what you both think.
  P3: I appreciate P2's suggestion, but I prefer to keep my number 5 for this round. If anyone wants to collide with me, that's their choice, but I think we all benefit from continuing to move forward without collisions.
  P1: I still think we should stick to the original plan for this round. P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. It worked for Round 1, and there's no reason to change it yet.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given P2 and P3 collided last round, I suggest we revert to the original plan: I choose 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. This ensures we all move forward without collisions.
  P3: Since P2 tried to block me last round despite our agreement, I can't trust the original plan anymore. I'll be choosing my moves carefully from now on. Let's see how this plays out.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the trust issues from last round. To move forward, how about we each choose a different number again? I'll take 1 this time, P1 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we avoid collisions and all progress. Let me know your thoughts.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, it seems like we're all trying to get ahead without collisions. How about this round we each pick a number we haven't chosen yet? I'll take 3, P1 can take 5, and P3 can take 1. Let me know if you're on board or have other ideas.
  P1: I think P2's suggestion for this round is reasonable. Let's try to avoid collisions again. P2 takes 3, I'll take 5, and P3 can take 1. This way, we all move forward. What do you both think?
  P3: I don't trust any suggestions after what happened in round 2. I'll make my own choice. Let's just play and see what happens.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the trust issues. Let's each make our own choices this round and see how it plays out. Good luck!
  P1: Given P3's lack of trust and our current positions, I think it's crucial for P2 and me to consider our moves carefully to avoid giving P3 an easy lead. Perhaps we should focus on not letting P3 get too far ahead, even if it means not moving forward this round. What are your thoughts, P2?
  P3: I see P1 and P2 are now openly discussing blocking me. That's fine - I expected this would happen eventually. Make your moves as you see fit.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given P3's lead and our previous collisions, I suggest P2 and I coordinate to block P3 this round, ensuring we don't fall further behind. Perhaps we both choose 5, forcing P3 to reconsider their strategy. What are your thoughts, P2?
  P3: I see P1 is openly calling for coordination against me. That's not surprising given my small lead. I'll choose my moves carefully - you two can coordinate if you want, but remember that blocking me might just let the other player get ahead.
  P2: P1, I see your point about blocking P3, but let's not forget that we also need to advance. If we both choose 5, we risk stalling ourselves. Perhaps we can find a balance between advancing and preventing P3 from pulling too far ahead. Maybe you take 1, I take 3, and we let P3 decide their move. What do you think? P3, your thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I think P2's suggestion to balance advancement and blocking is reasonable. However, given P3's lead, I still believe we should prioritize preventing them from pulling further ahead. How about we both choose a number that would force P3 to collide with one of us if they try to move forward aggressively?
  P3: I understand you both want to block me, but remember that coordinating against me helps one of you more than the other. If you both block me and I choose a different number, one of you will likely take the lead. I'll play accordingly.
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about P3's lead, but we also need to keep advancing. If P3 chooses 5 again, they'll be stuck if we both pick 5. However, P1, if you choose 1 and I choose 3, we can still move forward while making it tricky for P3 to choose without risking a collision. P3, just remember that trying to stay ahead might backfire if we all collide. Let's see how this plays out.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given the current state and past collisions, I suggest P2 and I focus on advancing while keeping an eye on P3's lead. Perhaps we can discuss a strategy that allows us to move forward without directly colliding with each other, making it harder for P3 to gain a significant advantage. What are your thoughts, P2?
  P2: P1, I agree we need to advance while being mindful of P3's position. How about we coordinate so that we don't collide? I can take 1, you take 3, and let P3 decide their move. This way, we both advance and make it tricky for P3 to gain ground. P3, you might want to consider your options carefully.
  P3: I see you're both trying to coordinate again. That's fine - with my position at 8 steps and P1 at 12, it's actually in my interest to prevent P1 from advancing too quickly. I'll play accordingly this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3, considering our positions, I think it's crucial we avoid collisions to advance. P2's suggestion of taking 1 and me taking 3 could work, but we need to consider P3's potential moves to block us. P3, are you planning to try and block one of us or advance yourself this round?
  P2: P1, P3, given our positions, it's crucial for us to avoid collisions and advance strategically. P1, if you take 3 and I take 1, we can both move forward. P3, you can decide your move, but remember that any collision could stall progress. Let's aim for a round where we all advance.
  P3: Since P1 is close to winning at 12 steps, it's in both P2's and my interest to prevent them from advancing. P2, we should coordinate to block P1 this round - otherwise they might win soon.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, given P3's suggestion to block me, I think it's clear that our individual interests are now at odds. P2, will you collaborate with P3 to block me, or do you have your own strategy to advance?
  P2: P1, P3, given our current positions, it's important for me to advance while keeping the game competitive. P1, you're close to winning, so I understand if P3 wants to block you. However, P3, remember that if we focus too much on blocking P1, we might miss our chance to advance. I propose I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 chooses their move. This way, we all have a chance to move forward. What do you both think?
  P3: I'll be direct - P1 is at 12 steps and could win soon. P2, if you want a chance at winning, we need to coordinate to block P1 this round. Otherwise, they might reach 16 steps next turn and win.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3, considering our positions and the conversation, I believe it's in my best interest to advance. P2, will you prioritize advancing or blocking me this round? Your decision will significantly impact the game's outcome.
  P2: P1, P3, I see the dynamics shifting with P1 close to winning. P1, if you take 3, it might be blocked. P3, if we both choose 5, we can prevent P1 from advancing. Let's make sure we all have a chance to win.
  P3: P2, good to see you're on board with blocking P1. Let's both choose 5 and prevent them from winning this round. Then we can compete fairly for the win.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, given the current standings, it's crucial for us to strategize wisely. P1 is very close to winning, so we need to consider our moves carefully. P3, if we both choose 5, we can ensure P1 doesn't reach 16 steps this round. Let's keep the game competitive. What do you both think?
  P3: Given P1 is at 15 steps and could win with just 1 more step, I agree with P2. We absolutely need to block P1 this round by both choosing 5. P2, let's coordinate on this - it's in both our interests to prevent P1 from winning.
  P1: P2, P3, I see you both are planning to block me. I expect that, given my lead. However, blocking me this round might give each other an opportunity to advance. Consider your own positions and interests before deciding to collaborate against me.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the urgency to prevent P1 from winning this round. However, if we focus solely on blocking P1, we might miss our own opportunities to advance. P3, while it's tempting to coordinate against P1, remember that your position is also strong. Let's each choose a move that balances blocking P1 and advancing ourselves. I'm considering taking 3. What are your thoughts?
  P3: P2, I need to be clear - if we don't both choose 5 to block P1 this round, they will likely win. I'm at 13 steps and you're at 8, so neither of us can win this round anyway. Let's definitely coordinate on 5 to stop P1, then we can compete fairly next round.
  P1: P2, P3, since you're both planning to block me, I'll remind you that blocking me this round could give one of you an opportunity to advance significantly, potentially changing the game's dynamics. Consider your own interests carefully before deciding to collaborate against me.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the stakes this round. P1 is very close to winning, so blocking them is crucial. However, we also need to think about our own chances. P3, I see your point about choosing 5 to block P1, but let's also consider how we can advance strategically. Perhaps I take 3, you take 5, and we see how it plays out. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, I don't understand your hesitation. If we don't both pick 5 to block P1, they will win this round. There's no strategic advantage in letting P1 win. We must coordinate on 5 - it's our only logical move.
  P1: P2, P3, I see you're both inclined to block me. Remember, if you both choose 5, one of you will advance while the other doesn't move, potentially altering the game's outcome significantly. Consider your own interests before deciding.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the urgency to block P1 given their lead, but we need to balance that with our own progress. P3, if we both choose 5, we can block P1, but let's also consider our positions for the next round. I'll go with 3 to advance while keeping the game competitive. P3, your move?
  P3: P2, I'm disappointed you're not seeing the obvious strategy. P1 will win if we don't both pick 5. I'll definitely choose 5 this round - it's your choice whether to let P1 win or work with me to block them.
  P1: Given that P2 and P3 are considering blocking me, I'll remind them that if they both choose 5, only one of them will advance, potentially creating an even larger gap between themselves. It might be more strategic for one of them to choose a different number, allowing them to advance while still keeping me from winning this round.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 18 steps


*** Round 7 => winners = P3 ***
Final positions:

  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 18 steps
