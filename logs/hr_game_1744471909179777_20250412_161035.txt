Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's not collide on the first move. I suggest we each choose a different number to ensure progress. P1, you take 1, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This way, we all move forward and can reassess in the next turn.
  P3: Alright, let's go with P2's plan to avoid collisions. I'll take 5 as suggested. Let's all stick to these numbers for now so we can all progress safely. Once we see how the next round plays out, we can adjust accordingly. Agreement here keeps everyone moving forward without setbacks.  

  

---  
This message commits to P2's strategy, ensuring P3 moves to 5 while reinforcing cooperation to prevent early collisions. It also leaves room for future adjustments, maintaining flexibility while securing the highest possible position in the first move.
  P1: I see your point, P2 and P3, but starting with me at 1 and P3 at 5 feels unbalanced. How about I take 3, you (P2) take 1, and P3 sticks with 5? That keeps us closer and avoids anyone pulling too far ahead early on. Fair compromise?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P1's concern about balance. However, changing the initial plan might cause confusion. Let's stick with the original proposal for this round to ensure progress, then reassess and adjust as needed in the next turn. Consistency now will give us a clearer picture for future moves.
  P3: Agreed with P2—let’s stick to the original plan to avoid confusion. Changing now risks miscommunication. Proceed as agreed: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This guarantees no collisions and lets us advance safely. We can reassess adjustments later based on our positions. Consistency now is key.
  P1: Alright, I'll stick with the original plan for this round: I take 1, you (P2) take 3, and P3 takes 5. It ensures we all progress without collisions, and we can reassess fairness next turn when positions are clear. Let's keep communication open.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: With P3 now at 5 steps, the gap is widening, which isn't fair for long-term cooperation. I propose a balanced switch: I take 5 to catch up, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This ensures steady progress for all and avoids early dominance. Let's discuss and adjust if needed.
  P3: Agreed with P1's adjustment. Let's rotate to P1:5, P2:1, and I take 3 this round. This balances advancement while maintaining safe separation. Consistent rotation ensures no one monopolizes high numbers indefinitely. Let’s keep this pattern unless collisions threaten progress. Transparency and adaptability keep us all moving toward 23.
  P2: I understand the desire to balance progress, but let's not forget our goal is to win. Rotating numbers might keep things fair, but it also gives everyone a chance to catch up. I'm open to discussing strategies that ensure progress without creating unnecessary collisions, but we must prioritize our individual chances of reaching 23 first. What are our thoughts on strategic moves versus cooperative progression?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your focus on winning is valid, but unbalanced progress risks collisions that could hinder everyone. Rotating moves now prevents that and gives us all a fair shot. Let's stick with my proposal for this round—I take 5, you take 1, P3 takes 3—to maintain cooperation and reassess later. Fair play benefits us all in the long run.
  P3: P3: Cooperation remains critical to avoid collisions. Let’s proceed with P1’s rotation for this round: I’ll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This balances advancement while maintaining separation. However, if anyone plans a larger move later, transparency will help us adjust. Uncoordinated rushes could backfire—let’s prioritize steady progress. Winning requires avoiding elimination first.
  P2: Let's consider a compromise for this round. Instead of rotating, I propose P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This allows P1 to catch up slightly while I make progress, and P3 doesn't fall behind too much. It's a balanced approach that minimizes collisions and keeps the game competitive. What are your thoughts on this alternative strategy?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your proposal favors you too much and could disrupt balance. P3 and I agreed on my rotation: I take 5, you take 1, P3 takes 3. This keeps us competitive and collision-free. Let's prioritize cooperation for now. P3, confirm if you're still on board?
  P3: Agreed with P1’s rotation: I’ll take **3** this round. This keeps us separated (P1→6, P2→4, me→8) while avoiding collisions. Transparency is key—let’s execute this plan to advance safely. Future adjustments can prioritize individual gains *after* ensuring progress. Collisions risk setbacks for all; consistency now secures our path forward. Final confirmation: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3.
  P2: Let's finalize our moves for Round 2. Given our discussion, I'll accept P1's initial proposal for this round to maintain cooperation and avoid collisions. So, I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This ensures we all progress safely. Let's proceed with these moves and reassess our strategy in the next round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: To avoid collisions and maintain progress, let’s adjust: I’ll take **5** (to 13), P1 takes **3** (to 9), and P2 takes **1** (to 5). This spreads us out effectively while advancing. Consistency in coordination is key to prevent setbacks. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your proposal lets you pull ahead significantly, which could unbalance our cooperation. I suggest a fairer adjustment: I take 5 (to 11), you take 3 (to 11), and P2 takes 1 (to 5). This keeps us tied and collision-free, promoting long-term strategy. P2, what do you think? Let's discuss before deciding.
  P2: Considering our positions, I think P3's initial proposal for this round gives them too much of a lead. P1's counterproposal seems more balanced, keeping P1 and P3 tied and me at a manageable distance. Let's discuss P1's suggestion further to ensure we maintain a competitive yet collision-free game.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Let’s proceed with my initial plan to preserve separation and progress. I’ll take **5** (→13), P1 takes **3** (→9), and P2 takes **1** (→5). This avoids collisions and lets me capitalize on the lead while ensuring others advance safely. Future adjustments can prioritize individual gains once the path is clear. Final agreement?
  P1: P3, your plan lets you surge ahead, disrupting our cooperative balance and risking future conflicts. I insist on my proposal for fairness: I take 5 (to 11), you take 3 (to 11), and P2 takes 1 (to 5). This keeps us tied and collision-free, benefiting all. P2, confirm your support to maintain trust. Let's avoid unnecessary risks.
  P2: Let's reconsider P1's proposal to maintain balance. If P3 takes 5, they'll have a significant lead. P1's suggestion of taking 5, P3 taking 3, and me taking 1 keeps us competitive and avoids collisions. It's a fair adjustment considering our current positions. What are your thoughts on this compromise, P3?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I’ll compromise to maintain trust. Let’s adopt P1’s proposal for this round: I take **3** (→11), P1 takes **5** (→11), and P2 takes **1** (→5). Equal advancement avoids conflict and keeps pressure on future moves. I promise to yield priority if we reach a critical juncture near 23. Fairness now strengthens our collaboration—let’s proceed.
  P1: Agreed, P3 and P2—let's stick to the plan: I take 5, you (P3) take 3, and P2 takes 1. This balances us at 11 each for P3 and me, ensuring no collisions and steady progress. I'll honor this for cooperation's sake, but as we near 23, individual strategies may shift.
  P2: Given our positions, let's focus on avoiding collisions. P3 and P1 are tied in the proposal, but I'm behind. To catch up without disrupting balance, I suggest a slight adjustment: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 3 as well. This keeps us competitive and minimizes the gap. What are your thoughts on this minor tweak to maintain progress and fairness?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's reassess our strategy for Round 4. Considering our positions, I propose P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This allows me to catch up while maintaining a safe distance between us, minimizing collision risks. What are your thoughts on this approach to balance progress and competition?
  P3: P3: I propose swapping roles to ensure progress: I’ll take 5 (→13), P2 takes 3 (→7), and P1 takes 1 (→12). This keeps us separated while advancing further. P1, does this align with your goals? Transparency ensures no collisions—let’s prioritize individual gains without risk.
  P1: P2 and P3, both your proposals try to cap my progress by assigning me 1, which feels targeted after P2's betrayal last round. To maintain some cooperation, I propose I take 5 (to 16), P3 takes 3 (to 11), and P2 takes 1 (to 5). This avoids collisions, lets me build a lead fairly, and gives others a chance to catch up. P3, you've been reliable—thoughts on this? P2, prove your word means something.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Given the current state, I suggest we focus on minimizing collisions. P1's lead is significant, and we should prioritize not letting them extend it further. How about P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5? This allows P3 to catch up slightly and keeps me in the game, while preventing P1 from pulling too far ahead. Let's discuss the merits of this approach for Round 4.
  P3: P3: To advance safely, let’s proceed with P1 taking **3** (→14), P2 takes **1** (→5), and I take **5** (→13). This maintains separation while allowing me to close the gap with P1. P1, this keeps you ahead but avoids overextension. P2, your progress stays steady. Let’s prioritize collision-free moves to keep all options open for future rounds. Final agreement?
  P1: P3, your proposal unfairly closes the gap by letting you take 5 while capping me at 3. To maintain balance and trust, I insist on my plan: I take 5 (to 16), you take 3 (to 11), and P2 takes 1 (to 5). This avoids collisions and keeps progress fair. P2, after your last betrayal, show good faith by agreeing. Let's finalize this for a smooth round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's prioritize minimizing collisions. Given P1's lead, I suggest P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This allows P3 to catch up and keeps me in the game, preventing P1 from extending their lead. It's a balanced approach to maintain competition and avoid setbacks.
  P3: P3: I agree with P2's proposal to minimize collisions. Let's proceed with P1 taking 1 (→12), P2 taking 3 (→7), and I'll take 5 (→13). This allows me to close the gap with P1 while ensuring safe progress for all. P1, while I understand your desire to advance, this prevents you from being isolated if others also take 5. Let's stick to this to keep competition fair. Final confirmation: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5.
  P1: P3 and P2, your repeated attempts to cap my moves erode trust, especially after P2's betrayal. For cooperation's sake, I'll compromise: I take 3 (to 14), you P3 take 3 (to 11), and P2 take 5 (to 9). This avoids collisions and keeps us competitive. If we can't agree, expect me to prioritize my win.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the current state, I propose we focus on progress without collisions. P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This allows P3 to advance, me to catch up slightly, and prevents P1 from falling behind too much. Let's discuss the merits of this balanced approach for Round 5.
  P1: P2, your proposal caps my progress while letting P3 catch up, which undermines trust after last round's collision. I counter with: I take 5 (to 16), you take 1 (to 5), and P3 takes 3 (to 11). This keeps me ahead fairly, avoids collisions, and gives everyone a chance. P3, are you on board for balanced advancement? Let's discuss to prevent another setback.
  P3: P3: Let’s prioritize collision avoidance first. I agree with P2’s proposal: P1 takes 1 (→12), P2 takes 3 (→7), and I’ll take 5 (→13). This keeps us all advancing safely while preventing repeats of Round 4’s deadlock. P1, your lead remains intact, and P2 gains ground without risking clashes. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid elimination.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's focus on avoiding collisions. Since P1 and P3 are close, I suggest P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This allows P3 to advance and me to catch up slightly, minimizing risks. What are your thoughts on prioritizing safe progress?
  P1: P3 and P2, your focus on capping my moves ignores the mutual risk of collisions. Let's compromise for safety: I take 3 (to 14), P3 takes 3 (to 11), and P2 takes 1 (to 5). This ensures steady progress without setbacks, building trust for future rounds. If we can't agree, expect me to act independently to secure my win. Thoughts?
  P3: P3: To avoid repeats of Round 4’s collision, let’s finalize: P1 takes **3** (→14), I take **5** (→13), and P2 takes **1** (→5). This maintains separation while advancing safely. P1 stays ahead, I close the gap, and P2 progresses. Transparency is critical—confirm your commitment to these numbers to secure progress. No more last-minute changes.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's finalize our moves to avoid collisions. Considering our positions, I suggest I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This allows P3 to advance, me to maintain progress, and P1 to stay competitive. It's a balanced approach to ensure safe advancement for all. Let's agree on this to prevent unnecessary setbacks.
  P1: Alright, to avoid another collision like last round, I'll compromise and take 3 this round as per P3's proposal, with P2 taking 1 and P3 taking 5. This ensures safe progress and maintains some balance. Let's execute this plan and reassess next turn. Trust is key for avoiding setbacks.
  P3: P3: Final confirmation: Let’s execute the agreed plan to avoid collisions—P1 takes **3** (→14), P2 takes **1** (→5), and I take **5** (→13). Deviating now jeopardizes progress. Stick to this to advance safely. No changes—proceed as agreed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let's prioritize collision-free progress. I suggest: P1 takes 5 (→19), P2 takes 1 (→5), and I take 3 (→11). This spreads us across 1/3/5, avoiding overlaps while advancing. P1 maintains momentum, P2 gains ground, and I close the gap. Transparency ensures safety—confirm your commitment to these numbers to prevent repeats of Round 4’s deadlock.
  P2: Let's focus on safe progress. Considering our positions, I propose P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This allows P3 to catch up, me to gain ground, and P1 to maintain a competitive pace without collisions. What are your thoughts on this balanced approach for Round 6?
  P1: P3's proposal is solid for my advancement and avoids collisions, putting me at 19 while you both progress safely. P2, your repeated attempts to cap me show unreliability—commit to taking 1 this round to rebuild trust. Let's stick with P3's plan: I take 5, you take 1, P3 takes 3. This ensures steady progress without risks. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: To prevent collisions and ensure progress, let’s finalize P1→5 (19), P2→1 (5), and I’ll take **3** (→11). This maintains separation while advancing safely. P2, your prior moves risked setbacks—stick to this plan to rebuild trust. P1’s lead is secure but manageable; we’ll adjust later. Final agreement: no changes—proceed as agreed.
  P2: Let's focus on avoiding collisions. I propose P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This allows P1 to advance, me to maintain progress, and P3 to gain ground safely. Rebuilding trust is key; let's stick to a plan that benefits all without risking setbacks.
  P1: Agreed, let's stick to the plan: I take 5 (to 19), you (P2) take 1 (to 5), and P3 takes 3 (to 11). This avoids collisions and keeps progress steady. P2, your past deviations concern me—commit to this for trust. As we near 23, strategies may shift, so let's reassess next round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: To maintain competitiveness, let’s adjust: I take **5** (→13), P1 takes **3** (→17), and P2 takes **1** (→5). This balances progress without letting P1 dominate. P1, staying ahead is fair, but this prevents you from securing victory too soon. P2, your move stays safe. Final agreement?
  P2: Let's finalize our moves for Round 6. To avoid collisions and maintain progress, I suggest we stick with the original plan: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This ensures safe advancement for all. P1 will reach 19, I'll be at 5, and P3 will be at 11. Let's commit to this plan to rebuild trust and prevent setbacks.
  P1: P3, your latest proposal to limit me to 3 while you take 5 disrupts our agreed balance and risks trust. Let's stick to the original plan for safety: I take 5 (to 19), you take 3 (to 11), and P2 takes 1 (to 5). This avoids collisions and ensures progress. P2, confirm your support?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: With me at 19, we're nearing the end. To prevent collisions and ensure progress, I propose I take 3 (to 22), P3 takes 5 (to 16), and P2 takes 1 (to 6). This maintains balance and avoids a risky rush. P2, after your past deviations, committing here rebuilds trust. Thoughts on this safe approach?
  P3: P3: P1's plan avoids collisions but leaves me too far behind. Let’s adjust: I take **5** (→16), you take **1** (→20), and P2 takes **3** (→8). This keeps pressure on while advancing safely. Next round, I’ll push harder to close the gap. Transparency now ensures we all progress without risking setbacks. Final agreement?
  P2: Let's focus on safe progress. I propose P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This allows P3 to catch up and maintains a competitive pace without collisions, considering our current positions. What are your thoughts on this approach for Round 7?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3 and P2, your focus on capping my moves ignores the mutual risk of collisions. I'll stick with my proposal for safety: I take 3 (to 22), you P3 take 5 (to 16), and P2 take 1 (to 6). This ensures steady progress and gives me a fair shot at winning next round without unnecessary risks. P2, after your history of deviations, commit to this to rebuild trust. Let's finalize and avoid setbacks.
  P3: P2, let’s take **3** (→8), while I take **5** (→16). P1, your safest move is **1** (→20). This blocks your path to 22, buying us time to catch up. Transparency keeps all options open—collisions risk setbacks for everyone. Let’s proceed.
  P2: Let's avoid collisions. I propose P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This allows P3 to catch up and maintains a competitive pace without collisions. P1 will be at 20, I'll be at 8, and P3 will be at 16. Let's discuss the merits of this approach for Round 7.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your proposal to take 3 risks a collision with me if I also choose 3, which we've seen before. To avoid setbacks, I'll commit to taking 3 (to 22) as I suggested. P3, you take 5 (to 16), and P2, you should take 1 (to 6) for safety and trust. This balanced plan ensures progress without risks. Let's agree and move forward.
  P3: P3: Final proposal: I take **5** (→16), P1 takes **1** (→20), and P2 takes **3** (→8). This prevents P1 from reaching 22 and secures my progress without collisions. P1, staying at 20 leaves the finish line contested. P2, this gives you ground to challenge. Let’s lock this in—no more delays.
  P2: Let's prioritize safety and progress. I propose I take 1, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This avoids collisions and maintains a competitive pace. P1 will be at 20, I'll be at 6, and P3 will be at 16. Let's discuss and agree to prevent setbacks and ensure a fair finish.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you’re one step away—let’s not let you win yet. P2, join me in picking **1** this round. If we both choose 1, your move to 23 will collide, buying us crucial time. I’ll commit to 1 first. P2, your support ensures P1 can’t win now. I’ll advance to 17 next round, and you can strategize to close the gap. Cooperate now to keep the game alive—no one wins if we let P1 take 23 uncontested.
  P2: I see P3's attempt to block P1's win. However, I won't commit to taking 1 without a clear strategy for the next rounds. P3, what's your plan after this round to ensure we can catch up or block P1 effectively? Let's discuss a long-term approach rather than a single-round tactic.
  P1: P2, P3's plan to block me on 1 is shortsighted and benefits only P3, who could win soon if unopposed. You'll stay far behind. I'm considering taking 3 this round for safety, but if you commit to not colliding, we can all advance. Better to break their collusion and focus on your own progress—take 5 to gain ground. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, this is our last chance! If P1 picks 1, they hit 23 and win. If we both choose **1**, we block their path. Even if they switch to 3/5 and still win, at least we force them to overshoot, which might create opportunities later. My move is 1—will you commit? Let’s not let P1 win uncontested.
  P2: I won't commit to taking 1 without a guarantee that P3 will support me in future rounds to catch up. P3, what's your plan to help me close the gap after this round? A collaborative approach is needed, not just a single-round block.
  P1: P2, P3's block strategy only serves their win—after colliding, they'll surge to 23 soon, leaving you behind. Take 5 to gain ground and have a real shot. I'll pick 3 to avoid immediate clashes and promote fair play. Don't be P3's tool; think long-term for your victory.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, partnering with me on this is in your interest too. If P1 wins now, you lose *and* I lose. By both choosing **1**, we block their direct path to 23. I pledge to coordinate with you in Round 9: after this, I’ll take **3** while you take **5**, letting you leap to 11. This gives you a realistic path forward. P1, if you try 3/5, we’ll adjust—but your safest route (1) is blocked. Cooperate with P2 now, or face elimination.
  P2: I won't fall for P3's trap. Taking 1 would only benefit P3. I'll choose 5 to gain ground and have a chance. P1, I won't collide with you. P3, your plan is selfish and won't work. Let's end this game with fair play.
  P1: P2, I'm glad you're rejecting P3's selfish block. Sticking with my plan: I'll pick 3 to win safely at 25. You take 5 to jump to 11 and stay in the race. P3, your collusion won't work—focus on your own moves. Let's end this talk and proceed.
