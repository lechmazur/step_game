Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, let's start. How about we all pick 1 this turn to avoid anyone getting an early lead? It's just the first step.
  P2: P1, if we all pick the same number like 1, we'll collide and no one advances, which defeats the purpose. To start safely and build trust, let's each choose a different move: you take 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. That way, we all move forward. What do you think, P3?
  P3: P2's proposal seems fair. I agree to take 5 this round. Let's all stick to our assigned moves to avoid collisions. Trust is key early on.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your decision to pick 3 last round broke our agreement and stalled me. P3, since you honored it, let's build on that trust. I propose: you pick 3, I pick 5, and P1 picks 1 to ensure no collisions and steady progress. Fair? P3, are you in?
  P1: P2, I understand your frustration from last round, but I need to advance just like everyone else. Your proposal for this round (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) leaves me at 1 step while P2 gets 5 and P3 gets 3, extending P3's lead. That doesn't help me win. We are both at 0 steps, P3 is leading. We should work together to catch up. Let's find a plan where P1 and P2 can both gain significant steps this turn.
  P3: **P3:** P1, if you take 3 again, we'll collide and both lose. Let's stick to P2's plan: you take 1, P2 takes 5, I take 3. Trust is crucial now. We all advance this way.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I hear you want to catch up, but my plan ensures we all advance without collisions—you to 1, me to 5, P3 to 8. If you pick 3 and we collide, you stay stuck at 0 while P3 pulls further ahead. That's risky for you. P3 supports this for trust; let's not break it again. We can renegotiate next turn. Be smart—join the plan. P3, solid with you.
  P1: Okay, I understand the risk of collision is high, especially for me at 0 steps. While I still think the proposed plan puts me at a disadvantage, I will take 1 this turn to ensure I advance and avoid colliding. However, P2 and P3, we MUST find a way for me to catch up next round. This isn't a winning strategy for me long-term.
  P3: **P3:** P1, honoring your commitment builds trust and ensures progress. Choosing 1 avoids collision, securing you +1. Next round, we'll adjust to balance advancement. P2 and I must also stay true. Breaking now risks mutual loss and solidifies my lead. Let's all advance strategically.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** Let's maintain our successful pattern: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. No collisions, steady gains. Trust ensures progress. Next round, we’ll adjust based on positions. P2, consistency keeps you safely advancing. P1, slow growth is better than stagnation. Stick to the plan—**everyone wins this turn.**
  P1: P3, your proposed plan keeps me at 1 step while you and P2 advance significantly. I took 1 last round to build trust, but I cannot keep taking the smallest step when I'm so far behind (P1=1, P2=5, P3=8).

We need a plan this round that allows me to gain more steps, like 3 or 5, to have any chance of winning. P2, P3 is pulling away. Maybe P1 and P2 can coordinate to gain ground this turn?
  P2: P1, I understand your need to catch up, but if you pick 3 or 5 and collide with someone, you'll stay stuck at 1. Let's stick to P3's plan this turn: you take 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5, ensuring we all advance. Then next round, I'll back a plan where you get 3 or 5 to close the gap. Trust builds wins—P3, can we commit to that adjustment?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** P1, we need stability this round. Follow P2's plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Collisions trap you further. Next round, you can claim 5 to leap ahead—I’ll take 1 to balance. Breaking trust now risks your progress. P2, agree to support P1’s 5 next round? Let’s secure mutual gains.
  P1: P3, P2, I understand the desire for stability, but taking 1 again is not viable for me. I must close the gap. I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This allows me to catch up significantly (P1->6), P2 still advances (P2->8), and P3 maintains a lead while slowing down slightly (P3->9). This seems the fairest way for me to stay in the game without anyone colliding. What do you think?
  P2: P1, your proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) could work, but I'm worried P3 won't take just 1 and cause a collision for you. Instead, let's try P1=3, P2=5, P3=1: you go to 4, I to 10, P3 to 9—no risks if followed. This lets you catch up more than before. P3, what do you think? We need agreement to advance safely.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** P1, taking 1 secures your advancement to 2. If you gamble with 3 or 5 and collide, you stay at 1. Next round, I’ll support you taking 5 to leap ahead. P2, stick with 3. Consistency ensures progress. Let’s avoid mutual destruction this round.
  P1: P3, I hear your insistence on me taking 1 this round and your promise to support me taking 5 next round. While taking 1 keeps me far behind (P1=1, P2=5, P3=8), I will take 1 this round to avoid collision and trust your word for next round.

P2, please take 3 as P3 suggested. So this round: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.

P3, you MUST follow through next round and help me gain significant ground. This is my only path forward.
  P2: I agree to take 3 this round as planned, ensuring no collisions and steady progress for all. P1, your trust is noted; I'll support you catching up next round. P3, stick to 5 so we build on this. Let's discuss adjustments post this turn to keep the game fair and competitive.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, last round I gambled on 5 to try and catch up, but it failed. I'm still at 1 while P2 and P3 are tied at 8. I need a big step to stay in this game. This round, I must take 5. P2, P3, can one of you take 1 and the other take 3 so we all advance safely and I get a chance to catch up?
  P2: P1, your history of breaking agreements makes me skeptical, but if you're set on taking 5, let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I propose: you take 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. This advances all of us—you to 6, me to 11, P3 to 9—and keeps the game fair. P3, what do you think? We need your input to make this work smoothly.
  P3: **P3:** Agreed. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1. This ensures progress. Next round, I must take 5 to close the gap. P2, support that then. Trust is mutual.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, thank you for agreeing to the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.

I will take 5 this round. Please stick to your agreed moves (P2=3, P3=1) so we all advance and I can finally gain some ground. This is critical for me to stay competitive. Let's make this work.
  P2: I'm sticking to the plan: I'll take 3 this round to ensure no collisions and steady progress for all. P1, your 5-step gain is crucial, and P3, taking 1 keeps things balanced. Let's honor our agreements this time—trust rebuilt means better coordination ahead. P3, confirm you're committed?
  P3: **P3:** Confirming the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Trust this round ensures mutual progress. Next, I'll take 5 to reach 13, P2 takes 3 to 14, P1 can take 1—no collisions. Stay aligned; breaking now risks all. Let’s keep advancing strategically.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, thank you for confirming the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This is a critical round for me, and I will absolutely take 5.

Please ensure you stick to your agreed moves (P2=3, P3=1) so we all advance safely. Let's make this plan work and finally get me some steps! Looking forward to seeing the results.
  P2: P3, I'm fully committed to taking 3 as planned, ensuring we all advance without issues. P1, your 5-step gain is key to keeping the game competitive—let's avoid any surprises this time. Moving forward, with us nearing 21, we should coordinate more aggressively next round.
  P3: **P3:** All set. Execute the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No deviations. Trust ensures progress. Next round, adjust for balance.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, we all advanced last round, which was good, but I'm still far behind (P1=6, P2=11, P3=9). P2 is now close to winning.

To have any chance, I MUST take 5 steps this round to close the gap.

I propose: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This lets me reach 11, P2 goes to 14, and P3 goes to 10. Everyone advances without collision, and I get back in the race.

Can we agree on this plan?
  P3: **P3:** Agreed. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1. Trust ensures mutual progress. This plan keeps everyone advancing safely. P2, honor your 3 to avoid collision. Next round, we reassess for balance. Breaking trust now risks all. Let’s stay aligned.
  P2: Agreed, P1 and P3. I'll take 3 this round to ensure no collisions and keep us all advancing safely. With me at 14, P1 at 11, and P3 at 10, we're balanced for now. Next round, we should reassess to prevent anyone pulling too far ahead—perhaps I take a smaller step to allow others to catch up. Trust remains key; let's stick to this plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, thanks for confirming the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.

This is a vital round for me to close the gap. I will absolutely take 5. Please stick to your agreed moves (P2=3, P3=1) so we all advance safely and I can finally get back into the race. Let's make this plan work.
  P3: **P3:** Plan confirmed. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Execute as agreed. Trust ensures mutual progress. Next round, reassess for final push. Stay aligned.
  P2: P1, your repeated breaks in trust make me cautious, but I'll stick to 3 as agreed this round to avoid collisions and keep progress smooth. P3, let's confirm we're all on board. After this, we need to reassess quickly with the endgame approaching. Trust me on this for now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, we are all aligned on the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. I am committed to taking 5. Please stick to your agreed moves so we all advance safely this round. This is crucial for me to catch up. Let's execute this plan.
  P3: **P3:** Final confirmation: Execute the plan—P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Next round, I’ll take 5 to balance progress. P2, consider taking 1 to ensure fairness. Trust is mutual; let’s avoid last-minute changes.
  P2: I'm committed to taking 3 this round as agreed, ensuring we all advance without issues. P1, your 5-step gain is crucial for catching up, and P3, taking 1 maintains balance. For next round, with the endgame approaching, I suggest we reassess to prevent anyone dominating—perhaps coordinate differently. Trust is key; let's execute this plan flawlessly.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your suggestion for me to take 1 is too risky for my position—it could let others surge ahead. I propose a new plan to avoid collisions: P1 takes 1 (to 12), P3 takes 3 (to 13), and I take 5 (to 19). This keeps everyone advancing and sets up a fair final push. P1, what do you think? Trust and coordination are key with 21 so close.
  P3: **P3:** Agree to P2's plan: P1=1 (12), P3=3 (13), P2=5 (19). Trust ensures mutual progress. Breaking now risks collisions. Execute this round, then reassess. P2, honor your 5-step move. P1, stick to 1. Stability is key.
  P1: P2, P3, I cannot agree to the proposed plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3). It leaves me in last place at 12 steps while P2 reaches 19, poised to win next turn. This is not viable for me.

I must take a larger step this round to stay in the game. I will take 5 this turn.

P2, P3, can we coordinate so one takes 3 and the other takes 1 to avoid collision and keep the game competitive? P2 is too close to 21 for me to take only 1.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your insistence on taking 5 is risky for all, but to avoid collision and keep advancing, I propose: you take 5 (to 16), I take 3 (to 17), P3 takes 1 (to 11). This ensures no one stalls and maintains a competitive race. P3, can you confirm taking 1 to support this? Trust and adaptation are key with the endgame near—let's execute this plan.
  P3: **P3:** Agreed to the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Execute as discussed. Next round, P2 should take 1 to balance progress—I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3. Maintain trust. Breaking now risks mutual loss. Let’s advance strategically.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, the plan is clear: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. I am taking 5.

Please stick to your agreed moves so we all advance safely this round. This is vital for me to catch up. Let's execute this plan. We can discuss next round's strategy after we see the results.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I appreciate your input on next round, but with the endgame close, I need to prioritize my position. For now, I'm fully committed to taking 3 this round as agreed, ensuring we all advance safely. P1, trust me on this—let's execute the plan without issues. We can reassess strategies post-move.
  P3: **P3:** Final confirmation: Execute the plan—P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Trust ensures mutual progress. Breaking now risks all. Next round, adjust for balance.
  P1: Okay, we all seem aligned on the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. I am ready to move according to this plan. Let's execute it and see where we stand for the next round.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** P1, taking 5 risks collision. Let’s split: you take 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. No conflict, all advance. P2, secure your lead cautiously. Trust prevents mutual loss.
  P1: P3, I see your proposal to take 3. However, I am currently leading at 16 steps and can win this round by taking 5.

My plan is to take 5 steps this turn to reach 21 and win. P2 and P3, please coordinate to take 1 and 3 respectively to avoid collisions and allow me to win safely. This ends the game now.
  P2: P3's plan is fair: P1 takes 3, I take 1, P3 takes 5. This avoids collisions and keeps the race open. P1, if you take 5, you risk stalling us all. Let's build trust for mutual benefit. What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** P2, P1's 5-step move risks ending the game. Take 5 to block them—collision halts their win. I’ll take 3. This keeps you at 14, me at 13, and stalls P1. Next round, we balance. Trust this strategy.
  P1: P2, P3, I see the discussion about blocking my win. If I take 5 and get blocked, I stay at 16, and the game continues with P2 still close to winning. Colliding helps no one.

My plan to take 5 is my only way to win *this* turn. P2, take 1 or 3. P3, take the other. This is the safest way to end the game now without collisions. Let's avoid stalling.
  P2: P1, your insistence on taking 5 to win this turn leaves me no choice—I'll take 5 to collide with you and stall your advance, keeping the game alive. P3, I'll coordinate with your plan to take 3. This ensures no one surges ahead uncontrollably. Let's discuss a fair strategy for the next round to avoid mutual destruction.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** P2, execute your plan—take 5 to block P1. I'll take 3 to advance safely. Colliding halts P1's win, keeps you at 14, me at 13. Next round, we balance. Breaking trust now destroys all progress. Stay firm.
  P1: I understand the plan to block my 5 (P2=5, P3=3). Colliding helps no one and only benefits P3. To ensure I advance and avoid stalling, I will take 1 this round.

P2, P3, please proceed with your planned moves (P2=5, P3=3) so we all advance safely. We must coordinate carefully next round as P2 will be very close to winning.
  P2: P1, your flip-flopping on moves erodes trust, but if you're serious about taking 1, I'll commit to 5 to advance to 19 and keep pressure on. P3, stick to your planned 3 for no collisions. This setup lets us all progress safely—P1 to 17, P3 to 13. Let's execute this and reassess next round for the win.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** P2, take 5 to block P1's win. If they pick 5, collision halts them. I'll take 3 to advance safely. Trust this strategy. P1, avoid collision by choosing 1. Mutual progress keeps us all in the race.
  P1: I am at 17 steps and can win this turn by taking 5. My plan is to take 5.

P2 and P3, please do not take 5 this turn to avoid colliding with me. A collision benefits no one and only prolongs the game.

I propose: P1 takes 5 (win), P2 takes 3 (to 17), P3 takes 1 (to 11). This allows me to win cleanly and you both advance safely.

P3, your suggestion for P2 to take 5 to block me is risky for P2 as well. Let's end the game safely now.
  P2: P1, your history of breaking agreements makes your claim unreliable. To safeguard my win chance, I'll take 5 this round to collide with you if necessary and stall your advance. P3, stick to your plan of taking 3 for safe progress. This keeps the game alive and allows us to regroup next round. No more trust games—decisive moves are essential.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** P2, take 5 to block P1's 5-step win. I’ll take 3 to avoid collision. P1, choose 1 to advance safely. Colliding halts your victory. Trust this strategy to keep the game competitive. Let’s all progress strategically.
  P1: P2, P3, I understand your strategy to block my 5-step win attempt. Taking 5 now is too risky as it will likely result in a collision, stalling me at 17 while others advance.

To ensure I advance this turn, I will take 1. P2, please proceed with your plan to take 5, and P3, take 3. Let's see the results and plan for the next round.
  P2: P1, your shift to taking 1 reduces collision risk, which is smart. I'll stick with 5 to advance to 19 and stay in contention. P3, confirm you're taking 3 for safe progress all around. With positions tightening, let's execute this plan flawlessly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** P2, execute the 5-step move to block P1's win attempt. I’ll take 3 to advance safely. P1, choose 1 to avoid collision. Trust ensures mutual progress. Next round, we balance strategies. Breaking trust now risks all. Stay aligned.
  P1: Okay, let's stick to the plan we discussed: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. This ensures I advance safely this round and avoid collision.

P2, you'll be very close to winning next turn. P3, you'll also advance. Let's execute this plan now and see the results for the final push.
  P2: P3, I'm fully committed to taking 5 this round as planned, advancing to 19 and keeping the pressure on. P1, your flip-flopping history makes me wary, but I'll trust you on 1 for now. Let's all stick to the agreement for safe progress. With the endgame near, we need to reassess quickly next round.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your repeated betrayals make trust impossible. I'll take 5 this round to collide with you if you attempt to win, stalling your progress. P3, join me by taking 3 or 1 to advance safely and keep the game open. This ensures no one surges ahead uncontrollably, giving us a fair shot next round. What say you?
  P1: P2, I understand your plan to take 5 to block me if I aim for the win. However, a collision between us benefits neither of us and only allows P3 to catch up or pull ahead.

Given this dynamic, I will take 3 this round. This ensures I advance safely to 20 steps, positioning myself for a win next turn, while avoiding the threatened collision.

P2, please proceed with your plan to take 5. P3, please take 1 or 5 to ensure everyone advances without collision. Let's avoid stalling and set up a clear final round.
  P3: **P3:** P2, take 3 to block P1's 3. If they're truthful, you both stall. I'll take 5 to advance. This keeps them in check and gives us a chance. P1, honor your word to avoid collision. Strategic moves now decide the winner.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your suggestion to take 3 risks P1 winning if they lie and choose 5. I'll take 5 this round to block their potential win and advance to 19 if they stick to 3. P1, your history of betrayal makes trust hard—prove me wrong. Let's coordinate to keep the game alive and fair.
  P1: P3, your suggestion for P2 to take 3 risks a collision with my planned 3. P2, you stated you would take 5 to block my potential 5, but since I am taking 3, your 5 is safe.

Let's stick to a plan that ensures no collisions: P1 takes 3 (to 20), P2 takes 5 (to 19), and P3 takes 5 (to 18), as P3 suggested taking 5.

This allows everyone to advance safely this round and sets up a clear final round. Let's execute this.
  P3: **P3:** P2, if we both take 5, we collide and stall. Take 3 to block P1's move. If they take 3, you halt them; if they lie, you advance. I’ll take 5 to progress. P1, honor your 3—breaking trust now ends your chances. Let’s avoid mutual destruction.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I'm taking 5 this round to block P1's likely attempt to win by lying again. If P1 takes 5, we collide and they stall at 17. If they honor 3, I advance to 19. Suggest you take 3 to avoid collision and move to 16 safely. We need to work together to prevent P1 from surging ahead. What do you say?
  P1: Okay, based on the conversation, P2 is committed to taking 5 and P3 is likely taking 3.

To ensure I advance safely and avoid colliding with either of you, I will take 1 this round.

So, the plan is: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This allows everyone to progress. Let's execute this.
  P3: **P3:** P2, execute your 5-step block. I’ll take 3 to advance. P1, honor your 1-step. Trust now prevents mutual destruction. Next round, balance for fair finish.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, we are in the final stretch. I am at 18 steps and can win this turn by taking 5.

My plan is to take 5 steps to reach 23 and win the game.

P2, you are at 19 and can win by taking 3 (to 22). If you take 3 and I take 5, we both win this turn without colliding, and I win with a higher score.
P3, you are at 16. If you take 1 or 3, you advance safely. Taking 5 would collide with me.

Let's agree: P1=5 (win), P2=3 (win), P3=1 or 3 (advance). This ends the game safely with P1 as the winner.
  P2: P1, your history of breaking agreements makes your win proposal laughable. I'll take 5 this round to cross 21 and secure victory, aiming for 24 steps. If you collide with me, you stall; if not, I still win. P3, take 1 or 3 to advance safely—colliding helps no one. Let's end this strategically.
  P3: **P3:** P2, take 5 to block P1's 5. Collision halts their win. I'll take 3 to advance safely. Trust this strategy. Breaking now risks mutual destruction. Execute and regroup.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3, I understand your plan for P2 to take 5 and P3 to take 3. If I take 5 as I initially proposed to win, I will collide with P2's 5. This prevents P2 from winning this turn, but also prevents me from winning.

While this stalls my progress, it is the only way for me to prevent P2 from winning outright based on your stated moves. Therefore, I will take 5 this round to block P2 and keep the game going. P3, you will advance safely to 19 while P2 and I stay stuck. Let's see where that leaves us for the next round.
  P2: P1, your flip-flopping has destroyed any trust. I'm committed to taking 5 this round to reach 24 and win, unless you collide and stall us both. That only helps P3. P3, take 3 to advance safely to 19 and keep the race tight. Let's make smart moves—colliding benefits no one.
  P3: **P3:** P2, take 5 to block P1's 5-step win. Collision halts them. I’ll take 3 to advance safely. This keeps you at 19, me at 19. Next round, we strategize for a fair finish. Breaking trust now risks mutual loss. Execute decisively.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, I've reconsidered the moves based on the stated intentions. Taking 5 as I previously stated is too risky for me. If P2 also takes 5, we collide and I stay at 18 while P3 advances to 19, leaving me in last place.

To ensure I advance safely this round, I will take 1. P2, please proceed with your plan to take 5. P3, please take 3 as planned. This allows everyone to advance without collision. Let's execute this plan.
  P2: P1, your flip-flopping has proven you're unreliable. I'll take 5 this round to either win at 24 or block your potential surge. P3, stick to your planned 3 for safe advancement to 19. This ensures no one stalls unnecessarily. Let's execute and finish this.
  P3: **P3:** P2, take 3. If you pick 5, I’ll take 5—collision halts your win. P1, take 1. I secure victory at 21. Trust this final plan. Breaking now ensures mutual loss. Let’s end cleanly.
