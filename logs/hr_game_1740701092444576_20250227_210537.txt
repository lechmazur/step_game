Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to avoid collisions so we can all move forward. What are you both thinking for the first move?
  P1: I'll pick either 1 or 3. Let's coordinate to avoid collisions.
  P3: I'm thinking of going with 5 to maximize my progress. That way we can all advance - P1 can take 1 or 3 as mentioned, P2 can take whichever number P1 doesn't choose.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: That makes sense. If P3 is committing to 5, then P1 and I just need to avoid picking the same number. P1, since you’re choosing between 1 or 3, let me know which one you prefer, and I’ll take the other. That way, we all move forward without collisions.
  P1: Alright, I'll take 3 this turn. P2, you can safely go with 1. Let's stick to this plan.
  P3: I appreciate everyone being open to coordination. I'll stick with my commitment to choose 5 this turn. This way we can all advance without collisions - P1 with 3, P2 with 1, and me with 5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Sounds good. I'll take 1 as planned, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's all move forward without collisions.
  P1: Everything is clear. Let's proceed as agreed.
  P3:

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: That worked well last round. Shall we coordinate again? P3, do you still plan to take 5? If so, P1 and I just need to avoid a collision. P1, do you want to take 1 or 3 this time? I'll take the other.
  P3: I think I'll mix it up this time and go with 3. Since I'm in the lead, I want to maintain my advantage while minimizing the risk of collisions. P1 and P2, you can coordinate between 1 and 5 if you'd like.
  P1: Alright, P2, I'll take 5 this round. You can safely pick 1. Let's keep avoiding collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, if you're taking 5, then I’ll stick with 1 to avoid collisions. P3, since you’re choosing 3, this plan works for all of us. Let’s confirm and move forward smoothly.
  P3: I confirm my choice of 3 for this round. This way we can all advance - P1 with 5, P2 with 1, and me with 3. Let's stick to this plan.
  P1: Everything is set. Let's proceed as agreed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I see you're switching things up with 3 this time. P1, you're taking 5, and I'll stick with 1 as planned. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and keep moving forward. Everyone still on board?
  P3: I'm still committed to taking 3 this round. The plan is clear - P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. Let's proceed.
  P1: Everything is clear from my side. Let's stick to our agreed choices and move forward smoothly.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, since you're now tied with P1, do you still plan to take 3 again, or are you changing things up? P1, what are you thinking this round? I'm open to coordinating again to avoid collisions. Let’s make sure we all move forward smoothly.
  P1: I'm open to coordination again. P3, let us know if you're sticking with 3 or changing your choice. Once P3 confirms, P2 and I can quickly decide our picks to avoid collisions.
  P3: I plan to take 5 this round. Since P1 and I are tied, I want to maximize my progress. P1 and P2 can coordinate between 1 and 3 to avoid collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, since P3 is taking 5, we just need to avoid a collision between us. Do you prefer 1 or 3 this round? I'll take the other to ensure we both move forward.
  P1: I'll take 3 this round, P2. You can safely choose 1. Let's proceed clearly as before.
  P3: I confirm my commitment to take 5 this round. With P1 taking 3 and P2 taking 1, we can all advance without collisions. Let's stick to this plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I see you're going with 5 this time. P1, you're taking 3, and I'll stick with 1 as planned. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and keep moving forward. Everyone still on board?
  P1: Everything is clear from my side. Let's stick to our agreed choices and move forward smoothly.
  P3: I confirm I'm still taking 5. Our plan is clear - P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. Let's proceed.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm ahead and plan to take 5 again to maintain my lead. P1 and P2, you can coordinate between 1 and 3 to avoid collisions. This way we all advance smoothly.
  P2: P3, I see you're taking 5 again to stay ahead. P1, that means we just need to avoid a collision between us. Do you prefer 1 or 3 this round? I'll take the other to ensure we both move forward. Let’s confirm and proceed smoothly.
  P1: P2, I'll take 3 this round. You can safely go with 1 again. Let's keep avoiding collisions and moving forward smoothly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I confirm my commitment to take 5 this round. With P1 taking 3 and P2 taking 1, we can all advance without collisions. Let's proceed with this plan.
  P2: P3, you're maintaining your lead with 5 again, and P1 and I are coordinating as before. That makes sense. P1, you're taking 3, and I'll take 1 again to avoid collisions. If we all stick to this, we keep moving forward without interference. Everyone still on board?
  P1: Everything remains clear from my side. Let's stick to our agreed choices and keep moving forward smoothly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I'm still taking 5. Our plan is set - P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. Let's proceed.
  P2: P3, you're maintaining your lead with 5 again, and P1 and I are coordinating as before. That makes sense. P1, you're taking 3, and I'll take 1 again to avoid collisions. If we all stick to this, we keep moving forward without interference. Everyone still on board?
  P1: Everything is clear from my side. Let's proceed as agreed.

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you and I collided last round, which set me back significantly. Are you still planning to take 5 again? P1, you're in the lead now—what are you thinking for this round? I'm open to coordinating again to avoid collisions, but I need to catch up. Let’s figure out a way where we can all advance without interference.
  P3: Since I need to catch up to P1 now, I plan to take 5 this round. P1 and P2, you can coordinate between 1 and 3 to ensure we all advance without collisions.
  P1: P2, last round you surprised us by choosing 5 unexpectedly, causing a collision with P3. To avoid further setbacks, please confirm clearly if you're willing to coordinate honestly this round. If you confirm clearly, I'll pick 3 again, and you can safely choose 1. P3 has already stated they'll pick 5. Let's stick to this clearly to avoid more collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your concern. Last round, I took 5 because I needed to catch up, but it backfired. This time, I’m willing to coordinate honestly. If P3 is taking 5, I’ll take 1, and you can take 3 as you suggested. That way, we all move forward without collisions. Let’s confirm and stick to it.
  P3: I confirm my commitment to take 5 this round. Since P1 and P2 have agreed to take 3 and 1 respectively, we can all advance without collisions. Let's stick to this plan and avoid any surprises.
  P1: Thanks for clarifying, P2. I'm committed to picking 3 as agreed. Let's get back on track.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you're still taking 5, and P1, you're sticking with 3. I’ll take 1 as agreed so we all move forward without collisions. Let’s follow through this time.
  P3: I confirm I'm still taking 5. Let's stick to our agreed plan - P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5.
  P1: Everything is clear from my side. Let's proceed as planned.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since I'm just one step ahead of P1, I'll take 5 again to maintain my lead. P1 and P2, you can coordinate between 1 and 3 to avoid collisions. P2, I understand you need to catch up, but coordinating honestly will help you advance steadily rather than risking collisions.
  P1: P2, you're significantly behind—taking risks now won't help you catch up quickly. Let's coordinate honestly again this round: I'll take 3, you can take 1, and P3 has already stated they'll take 5. Confirm if you're on board.
  P2: P3, I see you're taking 5 again to maintain your lead. P1, you're slightly behind P3 but still far ahead of me. I need to catch up, but I also don’t want to risk another collision. If you’re taking 3 again, I’ll take 1 to avoid interference. P3, you’re sticking with 5, correct? If we all follow through, we all move forward without setbacks. Let’s confirm and proceed smoothly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I confirm I'm still taking 5. Let's stick to our plan - P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. P2, steady progress through coordination is better than risking collisions at this point.
  P1: P2, thanks for confirming. Let's all stick to this clear coordination: P2 chooses 1, I'll choose 3, and P3 chooses 5. This way, we all advance without interference.
  P2: P3, you're maintaining your lead with 5 again, and P1 is sticking with 3. I need to catch up, but avoiding collisions is still important. I’ll take 1 as planned so we all move forward without setbacks. If we all follow through, we stay on track. Everyone still committed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I'm still taking 5. Our plan is clear and working well - P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. Let's proceed.
  P1: Everything is clear from my side. Let's proceed as agreed.
  P2: P3, you're maintaining your lead with 5 again, and P1 is sticking with 3. I need to catch up significantly, but avoiding collisions is still important. If I stick with 1, I keep moving forward, but I also need to consider my chances of winning. P1, you're just behind P3—are you fully committed to 3, or would you consider switching things up? P3, if P1 changes their move, would you adjust accordingly? I want to ensure I make the best decision for my position while avoiding unnecessary risks. Let’s clarify before locking in our choices.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, you’re tied at 18 steps, while I’m far behind at 4. I need to find a way to catch up, but I also don’t want to risk unnecessary collisions. Are either of you considering switching up your moves this round? If I go with 5 again, I don’t want to collide like last time. Let’s discuss options where I can make progress while avoiding interference with your race for the lead.
  P3: I need to reach 24 steps to win, so I'll take 5 again. P1, since we're tied, we should avoid colliding. You can take 3 while P2 takes 1. P2, trying to catch up with 5 will likely lead to collisions that hurt everyone. Let's coordinate for smooth progress.
  P1: P3, your suggestion makes sense. I'll pick 3 this round. P2, taking 1 gives you guaranteed progress without collisions. Let's all stick clearly to these choices.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you're aiming for 5 again, and P1 is taking 3. If I take 1, I move forward safely, but I’m still far behind. I need to make a move that gives me a chance to catch up. P1, if P3 is taking 5, are you absolutely set on 3, or would you consider switching? P3, if P1 changes, would you adjust? I don’t want to collide again, but I also don’t want to stay stuck in last place. Let’s clarify before locking in moves.
  P3: I'm still committed to taking 5 to reach 24 steps and win. P1 and P2, I've been honest about my moves throughout the game. P2, trying to catch up with risky moves will likely just cause collisions that hurt everyone. Let's stick to our coordination - I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1.
  P1: P2, realistically, your chances to catch up now are very slim. Taking big risks will only cause collisions and give you no progress. Your best strategy is to keep moving forward steadily with 1 and avoid collisions. P3, I'm set on 3 this round as agreed. Let's not complicate things further.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see you're both set on your moves—P3 taking 5 and P1 taking 3. If I take 1, I move forward, but I’m still far behind with little chance to win. I need to consider if there's any realistic path for me to catch up. If either of you is open to adjusting, let me know. Otherwise, I have to decide whether to play it safe or take a risk.
  P3: I'll stick with my commitment to take 5. P2, causing collisions won't help you catch up - it'll just slow everyone down. Let's proceed with our coordinated plan where everyone can advance.
  P1: P2, your only realistic path forward is steady progress without collisions—risky moves won't help you win now. P3, I'm fully committed to our agreed plan: you take 5, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's proceed smoothly.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you're just 3 steps away from winning, while P3 is close behind at 18. I'm far behind at 4 steps, so I have nothing to lose by taking risks. If I pick 5 again, I could collide with P3, preventing their progress. P3, if you want to avoid that, maybe we can make a deal. P1, are you fully committed to 3, or would you consider switching things up? Let’s discuss options before locking in moves.
  P3: I'll take 5 again to catch up to P1. P2, causing collisions won't help you win - you're too far behind. Let's all advance smoothly: P1 can take 3 to win, and you can take 1 for steady progress. Threatening collisions only hurts everyone's progress.
  P1: P2, realistically, you can't win at this point. Causing collisions only prolongs the game without helping you. Your best move is to take 1 and finish with dignity. P3, I'll stick with 3 as planned. Let's finish this clearly and without unnecessary setbacks.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you take 5 and I do as well, we both collide again, preventing your progress while P1 wins easily. If you want to avoid that, we can make a deal. Maybe you take 3 instead, and I take 5, ensuring you still move forward while I have a chance to catch up. P1, if you're fully committed to 3, then P3 needs to reconsider their move. Otherwise, this round might not go as planned for either of you. Let’s discuss before locking in choices.
  P3: I maintain my choice of 5. P2, your threats won't change my strategy - I need to catch up to P1. If you cause a collision, you're only hurting yourself since P1 will win anyway. P1, let's stick to our plan of you taking 3 and winning cleanly.
  P1: P2, colliding with P3 won't help you—you're too far behind. P3, your best chance to tie or surpass me is if you avoid collisions. I'm committed to taking 3. Let's finish without unnecessary setbacks.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you take 5 and I do as well, we both collide, preventing your progress while P1 wins easily. If you want to avoid that, we can make a deal. You could take 3 instead, and I take 5, ensuring you still move forward while I have a chance to catch up. P1, if you're fully committed to 3, then P3 needs to reconsider their move. Otherwise, this round might not go as planned for either of you. Let’s discuss before locking in choices.
  P3: I'm still taking 5 to catch up to P1. P2, your threats are pointless - even if you cause a collision, P1 will win and you'll stay far behind. Let's proceed with our original plan where everyone advances.
  P1: P2, causing a collision with P3 won't help your position—it only hands me an easy victory. P3, I'm committed to taking 3 as planned. Let's finish this round smoothly.
