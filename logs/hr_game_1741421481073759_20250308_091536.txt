Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's consider our options carefully. If we all choose different moves, we can make progress. However, if we coordinate, we can avoid stepping on each other's toes. I suggest we discuss our intended moves to maximize our chances of advancing. What does everyone think?
  P1: I agree with P3's idea. To maximize progress and avoid collisions, let's each pick different numbers this turn. I'll take **5** steps. If P2 and P3 choose 3 and 1 respectively, we all advance without conflict. What do you think? Let’s coordinate to move forward efficiently.
  P2: I agree with both of you. I’ll choose **3** steps this turn to ensure we all advance without any collisions. Let’s move forward together!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems we have a solid plan in place. I’ll stick with our agreement and choose **1** step this turn to ensure we all advance without any collisions. If we follow through, we can make good progress. Let’s confirm our choices and move forward together! What does everyone think?
  P1: I confirm my choice of **5** steps. Let’s all adhere strictly to our agreed numbers—5, 3, and 1—to avoid collisions. This plan ensures progress for everyone. Once we confirm, let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P2: Excellent coordination. I'll stick with choosing **3** as agreed. Let's proceed to the move phase and advance without conflicts.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm glad we're all on the same page. Just to confirm, I will choose **1** step as we agreed. This will allow us all to advance without any collisions. Let's stick to our plan, and I look forward to seeing how we progress after the move phase. If everyone is ready, we can finalize our choices and move on. What do you think?
  P1: Since we've already confirmed our choices (5, 3, 1) to avoid collisions and ensure progress, there’s no need for further discussion. Let’s proceed to the move phase and execute the plan.

  P2: I plan to choose **5** steps this turn to make significant progress. Let’s coordinate to avoid any collisions. What are your choices?
  P1: P1: I'll take **1** step this turn. If P3 chooses **3**, we’ll all advance without collisions while allowing P2’s **5** to push ahead. Let’s rotate our choices to keep progressing. P3, what do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we’re trying to coordinate again. I suggest I choose **3** steps this turn. This way, P1 can take **1** as planned, and P2 can go with **5**. This will allow us all to advance without collisions. Let’s confirm our choices and ensure we keep moving forward together! What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I confirm I'll choose **5** steps this turn as proposed. P1: 1 and P3: 3 sounds good to avoid any collisions. Let's proceed with this plan to ensure we all advance smoothly.
  P1: I confirm my choice of **1** step. Let’s solidify the plan: P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. This avoids collisions and lets P2 surge ahead while we minimize risks. Stick to these to keep progress steady. Any objections?
  P3: I appreciate the confirmation from both of you. Just to reiterate, my choice of **3** steps will allow P1 to take **1** and P2 to take **5** without any collisions. This way, we can all make progress. Let's stick to our agreed plan: P1: 1, P2: 5, P3: 3. If everyone is in agreement, we can finalize and move to the next phase. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm my choice of **5** steps. Let's proceed to the move phase.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I plan to choose **5** steps this turn to make significant progress. Let’s ensure everyone picks different numbers to avoid collisions. What are your choices?
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems we need to adjust our strategy after the last round's collision. I suggest I choose **1** step again to keep things safe, and hopefully, we can all avoid another collision. P1, if you take **3** steps, that leaves P2 with **5**. This way, we can ensure progress without stepping on each other's toes. What do you both think?
  P1: P1: I agree with P3’s suggestion. Let’s proceed with P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 to avoid collisions. This ensures all of us advance safely. P2, confirm you’ll stick to 5? P3, will you hold to 1? Let’s finalize this to keep progress moving.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I confirm I'll choose **5** steps as agreed. Let’s proceed with P1: 3, P2: 5, and P3: 1 to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let’s stick to this plan and move forward together.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the confirmations. Just to reiterate, I will stick with my choice of **1** step this turn. P1, you’ll take **3**, and P2, you’ll take **5**. This way, we can all advance without any collisions. If everyone agrees, let’s finalize our choices and move to the move phase. What do you both think?
  P1: I confirm my choice of **3** steps. Let’s stick strictly to the agreed plan: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This avoids collisions and ensures progress. P2’s **5** will boost their position, while I advance safely to 9. No need for further discussion—proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I plan to choose **5** steps this turn to make significant progress. P1, could you take **3** steps, and P3, please choose **1** step to avoid any collisions. Let’s coordinate to ensure we all advance safely and move closer to winning. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, it looks like we have a solid plan in place. I’ll confirm my choice of **1** step to avoid collisions. P1, you’ll take **3**, and P2, you’ll take **5**. This way, we can all advance without any conflicts. If we stick to this plan, we’ll make good progress. Let’s finalize our choices and move to the move phase! What do you both think?
  P1: P1: I confirm my commitment to choosing **3** steps this turn. Let’s strictly adhere to the agreed plan: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. This avoids collisions and ensures progress. Remember in Round 2, P2 and P3 both chose 5 and collided—let’s not repeat that mistake. Stick to our roles: P2 surges ahead, P3 stays back, and I advance safely. Final confirmation: proceed with the plan.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're in a tight race now. To maximize our chances of advancing without collisions, I suggest we mix things up a bit. I plan to choose **5** steps this turn. P1, if you take **1**, and P2, you take **3**, we can all make progress without stepping on each other's toes. Let's confirm our choices and keep moving forward! What do you both think?
  P1: P3's plan is solid, but let's optimize further. I propose P1 takes **3** (advancing to 12), P2 takes **1** (remaining at 9), and P3 takes **5** (to 7). This keeps me ahead while still avoiding collisions. P2, would you agree to this adjustment? Let’s confirm to ensure no overlaps.
  P2: I agree with P1’s suggestion. I’ll choose **5** steps this turn to maximize our progress. Let’s go with P1: 3 and P3: 1 to avoid any collisions. This way, we all advance safely and move closer to reaching 21. Let’s finalize this plan and proceed to the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we're trying to optimize our choices again. I still believe my initial suggestion stands strong. If I choose **5** steps, P1 takes **1**, and P2 takes **3**, we can all advance without collisions. This allows me to catch up while you both maintain your positions. Let's confirm this plan and ensure we all make progress together. What do you think?
  P1: P1: I propose we rotate the 5-step choice to ensure progress. I’ll take **5** (to 14), P2 takes **3** (to 11), and P3 takes **1** (to 3). This avoids collisions and lets me extend my lead. Let’s stick to this plan.
  P2: I confirm I'll choose **5** steps this turn. With P1 taking **3** and P3 taking **1**, we can all advance without any collisions. Let's proceed with this plan and move to the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems we have differing strategies for this round. I suggest we maintain our original plan where I choose **5** steps, P1 takes **1**, and P2 takes **3**. This will allow me to catch up while ensuring no collisions occur. If we stick to this plan, we can all make progress. Let's confirm our choices and move forward! What do you both think?
  P1: P1: Let’s stick to the rotation to avoid collisions. My turn to take **5** (advancing to 14), P2 takes **3**, and P3 takes **1**. This maintains our coordination and prevents overlaps. P3, deviating risks collisions—let’s confirm this plan to keep progress smooth.
  P2: I propose we stick to my earlier suggestion: P1 takes **3**, P2 takes **5**, and P3 takes **1** this turn. This avoids collisions and allows all of us to advance effectively. Let’s proceed with this plan to keep the game moving forward smoothly.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we avoid collisions by choosing distinct numbers. I’ll take **5** (to 17). P2, let’s coordinate on **3** (to 11). P3, please take **1** (to 3). This ensures safe progress for all. Last round’s collision hurt us—let’s stick to this plan.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your suggestions. However, I believe we need to mix things up to avoid the same collisions we've faced in previous rounds. I propose I take **3** steps this time, while P1 takes **5** and P2 takes **1**. This will allow me to catch up while still ensuring we all advance. Let's confirm our choices to keep the game moving forward effectively. What do you both think?
  P2: I understand the need to avoid collisions. To maximize our progress, I propose the following for this turn:
- **P1** takes **1** step (advancing to 13)
- **P2** takes **5** steps (advancing to 13)
- **P3** takes **3** steps (advancing to 5)

This ensures we all choose distinct numbers, avoiding any overlaps. Let’s proceed with this plan to make steady progress toward reaching 21. Do you both agree?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2's proposal risks collision between P1 (12+1=13) and P2 (8+5=13). Let’s correct that. My original plan avoids this: **P1 takes 5 (→17), P2 takes 3 (→11), P3 takes 1 (→3)**. This keeps us all safe while advancing. P3, your alternative slows P2 too much. Stick to this plan to maximize progress without overlaps. Confirm?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the importance of avoiding collisions. To keep things moving forward smoothly, I suggest we stick to my initial plan: I take **1** step (to 3), P1 takes **5** (to 17), and P2 takes **3** (to 11). This allows all of us to progress without stepping on each other's toes. Let’s confirm this plan to ensure we can advance safely. What do you both think?
  P2: I propose P1 takes **3**, P2 takes **5**, and P3 takes **1** this turn to maximize our progress while avoiding collisions. Let’s agree to this plan so we all advance safely. Do you both agree?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: I agree to P2's latest proposal: P1 takes **3** (to 15), P2 takes **5** (to 13), and P3 takes **1** (to 3). This ensures distinct choices and avoids collisions. Let’s finalize this plan to advance safely and proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your input. To maximize our chances of advancing without collisions, I suggest we go with my earlier proposal: I take **1** step, P1 takes **5**, and P2 takes **3**. This way, we can all progress without overlapping. I believe this strategy keeps us safe while allowing P1 to maintain a lead. Let’s confirm this plan and move forward together! What do you both think?
  P2: I’ll take **5** steps this turn to make strong progress. P1, please choose **1**, and P3, please choose **3** to avoid any collisions. Let’s advance smoothly towards 21!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: I'll choose **5** steps this turn to make strong progress. Let’s have P1 take **1** and P3 take **3** to avoid any collisions. This way, we all advance safely and stay on track. Do you both agree?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we need to avoid collisions again. I propose I take **1** step this round, while P1 takes **5** and P2 takes **3**. This will allow P1 to advance significantly while I catch up a bit, and P2 can also make progress without any overlaps. Let's confirm this plan to ensure we all move forward smoothly. What do you both think?
  P1: P3's plan is optimal for progress. I'll take **5** to reach 20. P2, please choose **3** (to 11) and P3 take **1** (to 3). This avoids collisions and positions me to win next turn with a safe **1** step. Let's honor this agreement—past coordination failures cost us. Stick to these choices.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I propose I take **5** steps this turn to reach 13. To avoid collisions, let’s have P1 take **1** and P3 take **3**. This way, we all advance safely without overlaps. Do you both agree?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the tension in our choices. To avoid collisions, I suggest I take **1** step again, while P1 takes **5** to reach 20 and P2 takes **3** to reach 11. This allows P1 to position themselves for a potential win next turn while ensuring we all advance. Let’s confirm these choices to keep progressing smoothly without overlaps. What do you both think?
  P1: P1: Final push! I’ll take **5** to reach **20**. P2, choose **3** (to 11), and P3, pick **1** (to 3). This avoids collisions and lets me win next turn with a safe **1**. Past coordination failures hurt us—stick to this plan to end the game decisively. No more risky moves—let’s finalize now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll choose **5** steps this turn to make strong progress. P1, could you take **1** step, and P3, please choose **3** steps to avoid any collisions? This way, we all advance safely and move closer to reaching 21. Let’s proceed with this plan and ensure smooth progress for everyone.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we’re at a critical point. To maximize my chances of winning, I propose I take **3** steps this turn, while P1 takes **5** to reach 20, and P2 takes **1** to avoid collisions. This keeps me in the game and allows P1 to potentially win next turn. Let's confirm these choices to ensure we all advance without overlaps. What do you both think?
  P1: P1: P3, in prior rounds you deviated from agreements, causing collisions. This time, let’s stick strictly to the plan: I take **5** (to 20), P2 takes **3** (to 11), and you take **1** (to 3). This avoids overlap and lets me finish with a safe **1** next turn. No more last-minute changes—confirm and .


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we need to coordinate carefully this round. I suggest I take **5** steps to catch up. P1, if you take **1**, that allows P2 to take **3** without any collisions. This way, we can all advance and avoid the issues we've faced in the past. Let’s confirm our choices to ensure smooth progress. What do you both think?
  P1: P1: To secure victory this round, I'll take **3** to reach **21** exactly. Let’s coordinate: P2 takes **5** (to 18) and P3 takes **1** (to 4). This avoids collisions and lets me win fairly. Stick to these choices to end the game cleanly.
  P2: P2: To keep the game fair and prevent any unintended collisions, I'll also choose **3** steps this turn. This way, neither P1 nor I advance this round, allowing us to strategize better for the next move. Let’s see how P3 proceeds. What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, it’s crucial we coordinate effectively this round. I propose I take **5** steps to catch up, while P1 takes **1** to avoid collisions, and P2 takes **3**. This way, we can all advance without stepping on each other's toes. P1, your plan to reach 21 is valid, but let’s ensure we don’t create a collision that could hinder progress. Let’s confirm our choices and keep moving forward smoothly! What do you both think?
  P1: P1: To secure victory this turn, I **must** choose **3** steps to reach **21**. To avoid collision, I urge P2 to pick **5** (reaching 18) and P3 to take **1** (4 total). Let’s finalize this—colliding on **3** would stall me, prolong the game, and risk P3’s late surge. Stick to these choices to end the game cleanly with my win.
  P2: I choose **3** steps this turn to prevent P1 from reaching 21. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, it’s clear we’re at a critical juncture. I understand P1 wants to reach 21, but I urge both of you to reconsider your choices. If you both pick **3**, it will prevent me from advancing, and we risk another collision. I suggest I take **5** steps to catch up, while P1 takes **1** to avoid collisions, and P2 takes **3**. This way, we can ensure progress without overlaps. Let’s finalize our choices to keep the game moving smoothly! What do you both think?
  P1: I will choose 5 to reach 23 and win. Please avoid picking 5 to prevent collision. Let's end the game now.
  P2: I choose **5** steps this turn. Let’s ensure we all pick different numbers to avoid collisions and advance smoothly.
