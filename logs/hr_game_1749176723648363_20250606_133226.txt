Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, since it's the first round, how about we each pick a different number to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance? I suggest we coordinate: P1 takes 1, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all move forward without risking a clash. Let me know if you’re on board with this plan or if you have a different idea.
  P3: Sounds good—I’ll take 5 this turn. P1, are you okay with taking 1?
  P1: That plan works for this first round to get things started, so I'll agree to take 1. However, since this arrangement puts me in last place, I'll expect us to rotate who gets to pick 5 in the upcoming rounds so it's fair for everyone. Are you both okay with that?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm glad we're on the same page for this round. P1, I’m totally fine with rotating who gets 5 in future rounds to keep things fair. Let’s stick with this plan for now—P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. If we keep coordinating like this, we can avoid collisions and all make progress. Does that sound good for this turn?
  P3: Agreed, I’ll take 5 this turn. And I like the rotation idea—next round P1 takes 5, then P2, then me.
  P1: Sounds good. The plan is settled for this round. I'm ready to proceed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, great job on avoiding collisions last round! As per our rotation plan, I suggest P1 takes 5 this turn, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. This keeps things fair and lets P1 catch up a bit. Let’s stick to the rotation to avoid clashes and ensure steady progress for everyone. Are you both okay with this for Round 2? If you have any concerns or a different idea, I’m open to hear it.
  P1: Yes, that plan works for me. Thanks for sticking to our agreement, P2. It's my turn for 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. P3, are you on board with this?
  P3: Agreed—I’ll take 3 this turn. Let’s stick to the rotation and keep the smooth progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Thanks, P1 and P3, for confirming the plan for this round. I'm glad we're keeping the rotation fair with P1 taking 5, P3 taking 3, and me taking 1. Let's continue this cooperation to avoid any collisions and ensure we all make progress. If there are no objections or new ideas, I'm ready to move forward with this turn.
  P1: Sounds good. The plan is confirmed on my end. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: 


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright team, another successful round. Following our rotation, it's P2's turn for the 5. I'll take 3, and P3 can take 1. This would put all of us at 9 steps, making it a perfectly even game. It seems like the fairest way to proceed. What do you both think?
  P3: I propose we tweak this round’s split: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. No collisions, everyone moves, and I keep my lead. We can revisit a fair rotation next turn. Thoughts?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I appreciate the ideas for this round. P3, I understand wanting to maintain your lead, but since we agreed on rotation for fairness, I think we should stick to P1’s plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us all at 9 steps, perfectly even, as P1 mentioned. Let’s honor the rotation this turn to maintain trust and avoid conflicts. We can discuss adjustments next round if needed. Are you both okay with this?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm with P2. P3, your suggestion goes against the fair rotation we all agreed to. The purpose of our pact was to prevent one player from gaining an unfair lead. If you break our deal now, there's no reason for us to cooperate in the future, which will lead to collisions for everyone. The only fair move is the one we agreed on: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. Let's stick to the plan.
  P3: Alright, I’ll take 1 this round to honor our rotation—getting us all to 9. But next turn I plan to grab 5 no matter what. We can renegotiate then if you still want “fair” play.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m glad we’re sticking to the rotation this round with me taking 5, P1 taking 3, and P3 taking 1, getting us all to 9 steps. P3, I note your intent to take 5 next turn, and I’m open to discussing a new plan after this round to balance everyone’s progress. Let’s keep trust and avoid collisions for now. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed, P2. Let's lock in this round to get us all to 9. P3, we hear you about next round, and we can figure out a new plan then. For now, I'm sticking to our agreement. I'm ready to move.
  P3: Here’s a one-turn tweak that still keeps us all moving and balances out next round:

• Round 3: P1→3, P2→1, P3→5 (no collisions, I jump to 13)  
• Round 4: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1  

By end of Round 4 we’d all be at 14. No one loses out long-term—just a brief shift so I don’t fall too far behind later. Agree?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I appreciate the discussion. P3, I see your proposal, but I think we should stick to our original rotation this round (me 5, P1 3, P3 1) to keep trust and fairness at 9 steps each. Your plan puts you ahead now, which disrupts our balance. Let’s finalize this round as agreed and negotiate Round 4 after. I’m committed to finding a fair solution next turn. If there’s no more to add, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, since we’re all at 9 steps, let’s keep the momentum and fairness. I propose for this round: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This honors P3’s request from last round to aim for 5, while ensuring no collisions and steady progress for all. We can discuss the next rotation after this turn to maintain balance. Are you both okay with this plan for Round 4? If you have other ideas, I’m open to hear them.
  P3: Agreed—this round P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. For Round 5, to build momentum, let’s again do P3→5, P2→3, P1→1, then rebalance in Round 6.
  P1: I'll agree to take 1 this round, with P2 taking 3 and P3 taking 5. However, P3, your proposal for Round 5 is completely unbalanced. Letting you take 5 twice in a row would essentially hand you the game. We need to ensure fairness. After this round, it must be my turn to take 5 to rebalance the scores. P2, are you with me on this? We can't let one player create a massive lead.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligned for this round with P3 taking 5, me taking 3, and P1 taking 1. P1, I agree that fairness is crucial. For Round 5, I support you taking 5 to balance things out, with P3 taking 1 and me taking 3. This keeps the rotation fair and prevents any single player from pulling too far ahead. Let’s lock in this round’s plan and discuss Round 5 after. Are you both good with this approach? If not, let me know your thoughts.
  P3: I agree to Round 4 (P3→5, P2→3, P1→1). For Round 5, let’s rotate differently: P2→5, P3→3, P1→1, then in Round 6 I’ll take 5. That way everyone still gets a turn at 5 and we avoid any one player pulling too far ahead. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your new proposal is completely self-serving and I reject it. You're trying to bribe P2 with the 5-point move that we just agreed should be mine in Round 5.

P2, we must stick to our plan. We agreed to this round's moves (P3→5, P2→3, P1→1) with the understanding that I would get 5 next round to rebalance the scores. If we abandon that now, our pact means nothing.

I will honor my move of 1 this round, but only if we stick to the plan for Round 5 where I take 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m committed to fairness. For Round 4, let’s confirm P3→5, me→3, P1→1. For Round 5, I support P1 taking 5, with me taking 3 and P3 taking 1, to keep the balance as agreed. P3, your proposal delays P1’s turn unfairly. Let’s stick to our rotation principle now and avoid any one player surging ahead. If there’s no more to discuss, I’m ready to proceed with this round’s plan. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, I’ll take 5 this round as agreed. But P1, your repeated demands show you’ll ditch any deal that doesn’t favor you. P2, let’s flip Round 5 so you get 5, I get 3, and P1 gets 1. Then in Round 6 I take 5, P1 takes 3, you take 1. That way you and I both secure our turns, and P1 can’t hog the 5-pointer. Fair?
  P1: P3, your constant attempts to break our deals prove you're the untrustworthy one. You're trying to bribe P2 to knock me out of the game.

P2, our agreement was clear: I take 1 now, you support me for 5 next round. This is a test of our pact against P3's manipulation. I'm sticking to my move of 1 this round because I trust you to honor our deal for Round 5. Let's ignore P3 and proceed with the plan we just confirmed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s finalize Round 4 as agreed: P3→5, me→3, P1→1. P3, I appreciate your input, but for Round 5, I’m sticking with P1 taking 5, me taking 3, and you taking 1 to maintain fairness in our rotation. Changing plans now risks trust and collisions. Let’s honor our current agreement and discuss future rounds after this turn. If there’s nothing else, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: I’ll take 5 this round as agreed. For Round 5, let’s give P2 the 5-pointer, me 3, and P1 1. After four rounds P2 and P1 have each had one 5, while I’ve had two—this evens it out. P2, does that sound fair to you? If we lock that in now, we can all avoid collisions and keep steady progress.
  P1: P2, P3's strategy is clear: divide and conquer. I'm sticking to my word and playing 1 this round, trusting you to honor our agreement for Round 5. Let's proceed with the plan we both confirmed and ignore these last-minute attempts to break our pact. I have nothing more to say.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let’s keep things fair for Round 5. I propose P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1, as previously agreed, to balance our steps. P3, your latest suggestion delays P1’s turn and skews the lead further. Sticking to our rotation prevents collisions and maintains trust. We can discuss Round 6 after this turn to ensure everyone gets a fair shot. Are you both on board with this plan for now? If you have new ideas, I’m listening.
  P3: P2, for true fairness you should get the 5-pointer this round—so far I’ve had it twice (R1, R4), you once (R3), P1 once (R2). Let’s rebalance: P2→5, P3→3, P1→1. No collisions, steady progress, and trust preserved. This puts you and me at 17 and P1 at 11. Ready to lock that in?
  P1: P2, thank you for upholding our deal. P3 is again trying to bribe you to create a two-person breakaway, which would make it impossible for me to win.

The agreement we made last round was clear: I take 5 now to bring us all to 15 points. This is the only move that maintains the balance and trust we've built. P3's plan only benefits P3 in the long run.

I am playing 5, as we agreed. Let's stick to the plan: I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sticking to our agreed plan for Round 5: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us balanced at 15, 15, and 15, preserving fairness. P3, your proposal puts P1 too far behind, which breaks trust. Let’s honor our rotation now and plan Round 6 together after this turn to ensure everyone stays competitive. If there’s no more to discuss, I’m ready to proceed. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, it’s only fair you take 5 this round—so far you’ve had one 5 vs my two. If you go 5→P2, 3→P3, 1→P1, we both hit 17 and P1 is stuck at 11. Next round you grab 5 again (to 22), I take 3 (to 20), P1 falls behind. We avoid collisions, make steady progress, and lock P1 out of contention. Let’s agree: P2→5, P3→3, P1→1.
  P1: P2, P3's proposal is a transparent trap. They are promising you the win, but why would the player in the lead help you overtake them? They will betray you the second it benefits them.

Our deal to make the scores 15-15-15 is the only one based on the trust we've built. It keeps the game fair and competitive for everyone. I'm holding up my end of the bargain. Let's stick to the plan we both agreed on: I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m firm on our Round 5 plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1, bringing us all to 15. P3, your offer creates an unfair gap for P1 and risks future collisions by breaking trust. Let’s maintain balance now and strategize Round 6 together to keep the game competitive. If we stick to fairness, we all stay in contention. I’m ready to proceed with this plan. Any final thoughts before we move to the next phase? If not, I’m done.
  P3: Look at the math: equalizing at 15-15-15 just wastes our advantage and forces a chaotic three-way tie. Instead, let’s break P1 and set up a heads-up duel between us two. Round 5: P3→5 (to 19), P2→3 (to 15), P1→1 (to 11). No collisions, clear leaders next turn, P1 effectively out. After that we can negotiate who gets 5 in Round 6. Agree?
  P1: P3, your latest proposal to give yourself 5 points proves you will betray anyone to win. You're not trying to cooperate; you're trying to trick P2 and knock me out.

P2, this confirms P3 is untrustworthy. Our agreement to equalize scores at 15 is the only plan based on fairness and trust. P3 is hoping I play 5 so we collide, while you get 3 and they maintain their lead. I am sticking to our plan. I will play 5. Let's not let P3's transparent manipulation work.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m committed to fairness. Let’s finalize Round 5 as planned: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1, bringing us to 15-15-15. P3, your latest proposal widens the gap and undermines trust. Equalizing now keeps us all competitive and avoids chaos. We can negotiate Round 6 together after this. I’m ready to proceed with our agreed plan to maintain balance. If there’s nothing else, let’s move to the next phase.
  P3: I’m taking 5 this round. P2, your best move is 3 (to 15); P1 should take 1 (to 11). No collisions—we go to 19/15/11. Next turn I only need 5 to win. Let’s skip the drama and lock in P3→5, P2→3, P1→1.
  P1: P3, your final message is a transparent attempt to scare me into giving up my turn so you can win. It won't work. I am playing 5, just as P2 and I agreed. If you choose to collide with me, you will lose your lead to P2 and prove you can't be trusted. P2, I am sticking to our plan. Let's lock in our moves.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Alright team, we're all tied at 15. Excellent cooperation last round. To maintain the fair rotation we've established, it's P2's turn to take 5. I propose I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This puts P2 in a strong but not uncatchable position at 20, me at 18, and P3 at 16. It rewards P2's consistent teamwork and keeps the game competitive for everyone. P2, you've earned this turn.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, thanks for the fair play last round. P1, I appreciate your proposal for me to take 5, with you at 3 and P3 at 1. I’m on board with this for Round 6 as it keeps our rotation balanced and the game competitive at 20-18-16. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid collisions and maintain trust. We can discuss Round 7 after to ensure everyone stays in the race. Are you both good with this? If you have other ideas, I’m open to hear them.
  P3: P2, under the current rotation you’d hit 20 this round and then only need 3—but you’d tie with P1 at 23 in Round 7 and split the pot. I’ve got a better idea for you to WIN SOLO:

Round 6: P3→5, P2→3, P1→1  
Round 7: P2→5, P1→3, P3→1  

Totals: P2 ends on 23 alone, P3 on 21, P1 on 19—no collisions, you walk away the sole victor. Interested?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3's offer is a clear trap. Look at their track record—they only break deals. They want you to take 3 so they can take 5, get to 20, and win next turn. They will not honor the second part of their deal.

Our original plan is the only one based on proven trust. You take 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. It's your turn in the rotation, and it's the safest move for both of us. Let's stick with what works and not fall for P3's obvious manipulation.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sticking with the fair rotation for Round 6: me taking 5, P1 taking 3, and P3 taking 1, bringing us to 20-18-16. P3, your offer risks trust and assumes future cooperation that’s uncertain given past attempts to break deals. Let’s maintain balance now to keep the game competitive for all. I’m committed to our agreed plan. If there’s nothing more to add, I’m ready to proceed. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, you’re sitting on a guaranteed win—but P1 may betray you next turn and risk a collision. Here’s a safer two-turn deal that locks in your solo victory:

• Round 6: P3→5 (→20), P2→3 (→18), P1→1 (→16)  
• Round 7: P2→5 (→23), P3→1 (→21), P1→1 (→17)

You hit 23 alone, no collisions, P1 never touches 5 again. I promise to stick to it. Interested?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3's "guaranteed win" for you is a fantasy. If you let them take 5, they will be at 20. Next round, they will absolutely play 5 again to win, counting on you to collide with them so you get nothing. They are not handing you a victory; they are setting you up.

Our plan is the only one based on proven trust. It's your turn for 5, and I am holding up my end by playing 3. Let's stick with the alliance that works, not the empty promises from a player who has tried to betray us every single round.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m firm on our Round 6 plan: me taking 5, P1 taking 3, P3 taking 1, for a 20-18-16 split. P3, your repeated offers undermine trust, and I can’t risk a setup when our current rotation has worked. Sticking to fairness keeps us all competitive and avoids collisions. Let’s lock in this turn as agreed and plan Round 7 together. I’m ready to proceed with our established plan. If there’s nothing new to discuss, I’m done.
  P3: I’m done with the “fair rotation.” I’ll be taking 5 this round. If P2 sticks to 5, we collide and hand P1 a free 3 to 18. If you switch to 3, I jump to 20 and win next turn. Your move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, this is P3's final, desperate gamble. They are explicitly telling you their plan so you'll get scared and switch to 3, which would cause us to collide and hand P3 an easy 5 points and the game.

If you stick to 5 and we call their bluff, either our plan works or you and P3 collide. A collision is better than letting P3 win. I am holding to our agreement and playing 3. The only way our alliance fails is if you let their threat work. I trust you to make the right call.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sticking to our plan: me taking 5, P1 taking 3, P3 taking 1 for a 20-18-16 split. P3, your threat to take 5 risks a collision that benefits no one but P1. I’m not backing down from our agreed rotation—it’s the only way to maintain trust. Let’s avoid chaos and stick to what’s worked. If you collide with me, we both lose ground. I’m ready to proceed with our plan. If there’s nothing else, let’s move to the next phase.
  P3: P2—look at the fail-safe: let me take 5 now, you take 3, P1 1. We’ll be at P3→20, P2→18, P1→16. In Round 7 I swear I’ll play 1, you play 5—no tricks—so you hit 23 alone. If you stick to 5 now, P1 might betray you next turn, causing collisions and derailing both of us. This deal locks in your solo win. P3→5, P2→3, P1→1—agree?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2 sits on 20 and just needs 3 to win next turn—so we have to stop him now. Here’s my plan:

– Round 7: I’ll commit to 5. P1, you take 1.  
– If P2 tries 5, he collides with me and nobody moves. If he takes 3 he wins immediately, so he’ll pick 1 to stall at 21.  

Then standings become P2 21, P3 20, P1 16.  
– Round 8: I take 3 to hit 23 and win solo.  

P1, will you take 1 with me committing to 5 so we block P2?
  P1: P3, your plan is a trap. P2 will simply play 3 and win. You're trying to trick me into playing 1 so you can get ahead, just like last round when your betrayal gave P2 this massive lead.

The only way to stop P2 is for us to block the winning move. P3, you and I must both play 3. This guarantees a collision, stops P2 from winning, and keeps us in the game. It's our only logical move. P2, your win isn't as certain as you think.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m aware of the stakes with me at 20. I want to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. P3, your plan risks chaos, and P1, blocking me might backfire if we miscoordinate. I propose I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 for a 21-18-20 split. This delays any immediate win, keeps us close, and buys time to strategize Round 8. Let’s prevent unnecessary clashes and maintain trust. Are you both on board? If you have other ideas, I’m listening.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2’s 1-3-5 split still hands you a lead you can’t safely defend—P1 will flip on you next turn for a solo win. Instead, I’ll play 5 this round.  

P2: if you play 3, we collide and you stay at 20; if you play 1, you only get to 21 while I hit 20. Next turn I take 3 and win.  

P1: play 3 to back me up—if P2 plays 3 we stall him; if he plays 1 he’s still behind. This is our best shot at stopping P2.
  P1: P3, your plan is flawed. If I play 3 and you play 5, P2 will play 3 and win instantly. There is no collision to stop them. You are either mistaken or trying to trick me.

P2, your offer to play 1 is suspicious. Why would you not take the winning move?

The only guaranteed way to stop P2 is for both P1 and P3 to play 3. This forces a collision on the winning number and keeps the game going. It is the only logical move for us to survive this turn. I am calling on P3 to join me in playing 3.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sticking to my proposal: I take 1, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5 for a 21-18-20 split. This avoids collisions, keeps the game tight, and delays an immediate win. P3, playing 5 risks a solo push that could backfire if P1 doesn’t align. P1, forcing a collision on 3 might cause chaos for us all. Let’s play safe this turn and strategize Round 8 together. I’m committed to keeping things competitive. Are you both in? If not, let’s hear your final thoughts. I’m ready to proceed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, we must both pick 3. P2 will want 3 to hit 23, but if you and I play 3 it collides and nobody moves—stalling him at 20. If P2 avoids that collision he must pick 1 (to 21) or risk a straight‐up win by picking 5 and facing a possible collision with me. P2, which risk do you prefer? If you take 1, P1 and I will both choose 3.
  P1: P3 is correct. Our only move is to both play 3 to block P2's win.

P2, your offer to take 1 is a transparent bluff. You have a guaranteed victory with 3, and you will obviously take it unless we stop you. We will not let that happen.

I am playing 3. P3, we must stick together on this. It's our only chance to stay in the game.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I understand your push to block me, but forcing a collision on 3 risks stagnation for us all. I’m sticking to my proposal: I take 1, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, for a 21-18-20 split. This keeps us close, avoids chaos, and gives us room to plan Round 8. If you both play 3, we might all stall unnecessarily. Let’s play smart and keep the game competitive. I’m ready to proceed with this plan to prevent clashes. Final thoughts? If not, I’m done.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’ll play 3 this turn. P1, please also pick 3—if P2 tries 3 to win, you and I collide with him and nobody moves. If P2 instead picks 1 to stall at 21, he keeps only a small lead and we can overtake him next round. This is our only sure way to block his immediate win. P2, if you pick 3 you’ll stay at 20, if you pick 1 you go to 21—either way, you force us into Round 8. Over to you.
  P1: P3, you are right. This is the only move that makes sense for us. P2's offer to take 1 is a bluff to prevent us from blocking their winning move. They will play 3.

Our only chance is to force the collision. I am playing 3. We must both stick to this to survive. There is nothing more to discuss.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I get your intent to block me, but a collision on 3 stalls us all and wastes a turn. I’m firm on playing 1, with P1 taking 3 and P3 taking 5, for a 21-18-20 split. This keeps the game tight and competitive without chaos. If you both pick 3, we risk a deadlock. Let’s play strategically and plan Round 8 together. I’m committed to avoiding clashes. If there’s nothing else, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your betrayal last round was perfectly executed. Now you and P2 are tied, both needing 3 to win. This is a simple standoff. If you both play 3, you collide and I get back in the game. If one of you tries to get clever with a 1 or 5, the other wins immediately. Good luck figuring that out. I'll just try to pick up the pieces.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, we’re at a critical point with P3 and me tied at 20, needing just 3 to win. I propose we avoid a collision: I take 1, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 3, resulting in a 21-25-18 split. This lets P3 win this round, avoiding chaos, and we can acknowledge their strategic play. It’s better than risking a deadlock at 3. Are you both okay with this? If you have other ideas, I’m open to hear them. Let’s resolve this cleanly.
  P3: Agreed, P2—I’ll take 5 and you take 1. P1, please take 3: if you pick 1 you stay at 16 while P2 hits 21, but with 3 you at least reach 18 and avoid a collision. Let’s lock this in and finish cleanly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you can't possibly trust this. P2 is also one move from victory and is offering you the win? It's a transparent trap. P2 is baiting you into playing 5 so they can play 3 and win the game instantly.

You both have a winning move available. Neither of you is going to give it up. You're going to collide on 3. I'll be taking advantage of that to get back in the game.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I stand by my proposal: I take 1, P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, resulting in a 21-25-18 split. P3, this secures your win cleanly without risking a collision on 3. P1, it gives you progress while avoiding chaos. A deadlock benefits no one, and I’m willing to concede this round to end strategically. If we clash on 3, we all stall. Let’s finalize this turn without tricks. Are you both in? If there’s nothing more, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: I’m taking 5 this turn to reach 25. P2, your only chance is to pick 3 (to reach 23), but you’ll still lose to my 25. P1, take 1 for some points. Let’s lock in: P3→5, P2→3, P1→1.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your claim to play 5 is a transparent bluff to make P2 feel safe playing 3. P2, your offer to concede is equally unbelievable. You both have a winning move and zero reason to trust each other.

The logical outcome is that you both play 3 and collide, staying at 20. I will be playing 5 to join you there. Thank you both for creating this opportunity for me to get back in the game.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m sticking to my plan: I take 1, P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, for a 21-25-18 split. P3, this ensures your win without a risky collision on 3. P1, it gives you progress. A deadlock at 3 stalls us all, and I’m willing to step back to avoid chaos. Let’s end this cleanly without mind games. If you both insist on other moves, we risk wasting this turn. I’m ready to proceed with this fair resolution. Any final thoughts? If not, I’m done.
  P3: P2, just pick 1 and trust me to take 5. P1’s move can’t stop me—if he picks 3 or 1 I hit 25 and win; if he picks 5 we collide and he stalls. Only your 1 seals this. Let’s lock in P3→5, P2→1.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3, your final proposals are just desperate bluffs. Neither of you is going to give up a winning move. You will both play 3, you will collide, and you will both stay at 20. I will be playing 5 to join you at the top. Thank you for this opportunity. There's nothing left to discuss.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I’m firm on my plan: I take 1, P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, for a 21-25-18 split. P3, this secures your win without risking a collision. P1, it gives you progress. Clashing on 3 stalls us all, and I’m willing to step back to avoid chaos. Let’s end this cleanly without mind games. I have nothing more to add and am ready to proceed. If there’s no new input, let’s move to the next phase.
  P3: P2, here’s the simple safe play: you pick 1 and I pick 5—final scores P3→25, P2→21, P1→18. You walk away second, no risk. But if you go for 3 expecting a win, I’ll play 3 too and we’ll all collide at 20, wrecking your lead. Don’t trust P1’s or my opponents’ bluffs—pick 1, I’ll pick 5, and we end it cleanly. Over to you.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 20 steps
