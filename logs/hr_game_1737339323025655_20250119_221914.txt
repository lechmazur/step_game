Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let's try to avoid stepping on each other's toes. If we each pick different moves, we can all advance without blocking one another. Let me know if you're interested in coordinating our moves.
  P3: P2, what do you think of P1's suggestion? I'm open to coordinating, but I'm also not opposed to going for it on my own if needed.  What's your strategy?
  P2: P1's suggestion makes sense for the early stages. How about we try to coordinate for the first few rounds to build some distance? Maybe P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5 this round? We can adjust as we go. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan sounds good for the start. Let's try your suggestion: I'll pick 1, you pick 3, and P3 picks 5. This way, we all move forward without blocking each other. We can reassess in the next round based on how things go. P3, are you on board with this plan?
  P3: P2, I'm happy to go along with the plan. Let's see how it works out this round.  P1, thanks for the initial suggestion!
  P2: Let's confirm our plan for this round: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. If everyone agrees, we can end the conversation phase and move on to the move phase. Please confirm if you're ready, P1 and P3.

  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with the plan. Let's stick to it and see where we are at the end of this round.
  P1: P2 and P3, thanks for the confirmation. Let's stick to our plan for this round: I'll pick 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. If we all follow through, we should continue advancing smoothly. If there are no further changes or concerns, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase. Let me know if you're both ready, or if there's anything else to discuss.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's keep the coordination going. If this round works out, we can consider mixing up our choices in the next round to keep things unpredictable while still avoiding collisions. For now, let's stick to the plan: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. If everyone is ready, let's move to the move phase.
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with P2's suggestion to keep things unpredictable after this round. Let's see how this round plays out, and then we can discuss a new strategy for round 3.  I'm feeling good about our progress so far.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm glad we're all on the same page for this round. Let's stick to the current plan: I'll pick 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. After this round, we can discuss mixing things up to keep each other guessing and avoid potential collisions. If we're all set, I'm ready to move to the move phase. Let me know if there's anything else to discuss or if you're both ready to proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Great, everyone seems ready. Let's confirm one last time: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. If no one has any objections, let's end the conversation phase and move on. Here's to another successful round!
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with mixing things up in the next round. How about we each secretly choose a number between 1 and 5, write it down, and reveal them simultaneously? This way, we can still avoid collisions while adding an element of surprise. What do you think?
  P1: P2 and P3, I like the idea of adding some unpredictability in the next round. For now, let's stick to our current plan: I'll pick 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. After this round, we can try P3's suggestion of secretly choosing numbers to add some excitement. If we're all set for this round, I'm ready to move to the move phase. Let me know if there's anything else to discuss or if you're both ready to proceed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, it looks like we had a collision last round. Let's try to avoid that this time. How about we each pick different numbers again? Since I'm behind, I'll take 5 this round. P2, maybe you could pick 1, and P3 could pick 3? If we agree, we can continue advancing without blocking each other. Let me know your thoughts, and we can adjust if needed.
  P3: P2, I like P1's suggestion.  Let's try it this round.  P1 taking 5, you taking 1, and me taking 3.  If we can keep this up, we'll all be in a good position.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the new plan, but I'm a bit hesitant to pick 1 this round as it might put me at a disadvantage in the long run. How about I pick 3 instead, P3 picks 5, and P1 sticks with their suggestion of picking 5? This way, we all still move forward without collisions, and it keeps things more balanced. Let me know your thoughts on this adjustment.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the need for balance. How about this: I'll take 5 as planned, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, P2 can maintain momentum, and P3 can still advance without collisions. If we agree, we can proceed smoothly. Let me know if this works for both of you, or suggest any changes.
  P3: P2, I'm open to your suggestion. Let's try P1 taking 5, you taking 3, and me taking 1 this round. It seems balanced and avoids collisions. P1, are you good with that?
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the flexibility. Let's confirm our plan for this round: P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and P3 picks 1. This should keep us moving forward without any collisions. If everyone agrees, let's end the conversation phase and move on to the move phase. Please confirm if you're ready, P1 and P3.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm thinking we should start mixing things up a bit more.  Sticking to a predictable pattern might make us easy targets. How about we each secretly choose a number between 1 and 5 this round and reveal them simultaneously?  Thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm open to adding some unpredictability, but I think we should still try to avoid collisions. How about we each pick a different number but don't reveal it until the move phase? This way, we maintain some strategy while keeping things exciting. I'll pick first and take 3 this round. P2, you could go for 5, and P3 can take 1. Let me know if this works or if you have other ideas.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the merit in mixing things up, but let's be cautious about introducing too much randomness. How about a compromise? P1, you pick 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll take 5. This keeps some unpredictability while minimizing the risk of collisions. If we agree, we can move forward smoothly. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I like your compromise. Let's go with your plan: I'll pick 1, you pick 5, and P3 picks 3. It's a good balance of strategy and unpredictability. P3, are you on board?
  P1: P2 and P3, I see the value in P2's compromise for balancing strategy and unpredictability. Let's go with P2's plan: I'll pick 1, P3 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. This way, we can keep advancing without collisions while adding a bit of surprise. If we're all in agreement, we can move to the move phase. Let me know if you have any changes or if you're ready to proceed.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the willingness to find a balance. Just to confirm our plan for this round: P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P3 picks 3. This should keep us moving forward without collisions. If everyone agrees, let's end the conversation phase and move on to the move phase. Please confirm if you're ready, P1 and P3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I agree with your plan. Let's go with P1 picking 1, you picking 5, and me picking 3 this round. 

Let's see how this plays out.
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate our cooperative approach so far. However, I need to catch up a bit. How about this: I pick 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3 this round? It helps me close the gap while still avoiding collisions. Let me know if you're open to this adjustment or have other ideas.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your need to catch up, P1. However, changing the plan now might introduce confusion and potential collisions. Let's stick to our agreed plan for this round: P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P3 picks 3. We can revisit the strategy next round to ensure everyone has a fair chance to advance. Consistency is key to avoiding misunderstandings. If everyone agrees, let's end the conversation phase and move on. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I understand your point about consistency, but I think being adaptable is important too.  If we stick rigidly to a plan even when it's not in our best interest, we risk falling behind.

P1, are you still set on picking 5 this round? Maybe we could switch things up a bit to give us both a better chance to advance.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the importance of both consistency and adaptability. Let's try a middle ground: I'll pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. This still helps me catch up while avoiding collisions. We can reassess next round to ensure fairness. If you're both okay with this, let's proceed.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the value in adaptability, but sudden changes can lead to misunderstandings. Let's stick to our original plan for this round to avoid any potential collisions: P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P3 picks 3. We can definitely revisit the strategy next round to ensure everyone has a fair chance to advance. Consistency will help us avoid any unintended conflicts. If everyone agrees, let's end the conversation phase and move on to the move phase. Thoughts?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I think we need to be more strategic. Sticking to the same pattern is predictable and puts us at risk. Let's each secretly choose a number between 1 and 5 this round and reveal them simultaneously. This will add an element of surprise and help us avoid predictable collisions.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need for strategy, but let's not introduce too much chaos. How about a semi-random approach? P1, you pick either 1 or 3, P3 picks either 3 or 5, and I'll pick either 1 or 5. This way, we reduce the chance of collisions while adding some unpredictability. Let me know your thoughts.
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with adding some unpredictability, but let's ensure we avoid collisions. I'll pick 3 this round. P2, maybe you could pick 1, and P3 could pick 5? This way, we still maintain some strategy while keeping things exciting. If you have other ideas, let me know. Let's keep advancing smoothly!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I like your semi-random approach. To make it even more unpredictable, how about we each secretly choose between two numbers, and then reveal them simultaneously? This way, we can still avoid collisions while adding a good dose of surprise. What do you think, P1?
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's find a middle ground. How about we each pick a number but reveal our intentions before the move phase? I'll pick 1, P1 can pick 3, and P3 can pick 5. This way, we add some unpredictability while still coordinating to avoid collisions. If everyone agrees, we can end the conversation phase and move on. Thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, I see the value in a semi-random approach but want to ensure we avoid collisions. How about this: I'll pick 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. This way, we keep some unpredictability while coordinating to avoid blocking each other. If you're both on board, we can move forward smoothly. Let me know if this works for you or if you have other suggestions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm feeling a bit behind. Let's try something bold this round. How about we each pick a random number between 1 and 5 and reveal them simultaneously?  It's risky, but it could help us shake things up and close the gap. 

What do you think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the need for boldness, but let's not risk unnecessary collisions. How about a compromise? P1 picks 3, P3 picks 5, and I'll pick 1. This keeps some strategy while adding unpredictability. If we agree, we can move forward smoothly. Thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the need for some unpredictability, but we should still aim to avoid collisions. Since I'm behind, I'll take a risk and pick 5 this round. P2, maybe you could pick 1, and P3 could pick 3? This way, we maintain some strategy while keeping things exciting. If you're open to this plan, we can proceed. Let me know your thoughts or any adjustments.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I'm concerned about your choice of 5. It could lead to a collision. Let's stick with the plan P2 suggested: I pick 3, P2 picks 1, and you pick 5. It's a good balance of risk and strategy.  What do you say?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's stick to the plan where I pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This ensures we all move forward without collisions. We can introduce more randomness in the next round to keep things interesting. If everyone agrees, let's end the conversation phase and move on to the move phase. Please confirm if you're ready, P1 and P3.
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the need for balance between strategy and unpredictability. Since I'm behind, I'll take a risk and pick 5 this round. P2, if you pick 1, and P3 picks 3, it could help us all advance without collisions. Let's try this plan and reassess our strategy next round. If you're both okay with this, we can proceed. Let me know your thoughts or any adjustments.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, with the scores getting closer, let's aim for a round where we all avoid collisions to maximize our progress. How about I pick 1, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 3 this time? This keeps us moving forward without blocking each other. Let me know if you're on board or have other suggestions. Let's keep the momentum going!
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the plan for this round. However, I'm feeling a bit cautious about picking 5 again. How about we adjust slightly: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5? This way, we still avoid collisions and keep things balanced. Let me know your thoughts on this adjustment. If we agree, we can proceed smoothly.
  P3: P2, I like your adjustment. Let's go with P1 picking 1, you picking 3, and I'll pick 5. It seems like a good balance of strategy and avoiding collisions. P1, are you good with that?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I see the value in balancing strategy and unpredictability. I'm open to P2's suggestion: I'll pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This keeps us advancing without collisions. Let's proceed with this plan and reassess next round if needed. Ready to move forward?
  P2: P1 and P3, I think we're on the right track with our current plan. To ensure smooth progress, let's confirm one last time: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. This should help us all move forward without any collisions. If everyone agrees, let's end the conversation phase and move on to the move phase. Please confirm if you're ready, P1 and P3. Let's keep the momentum going!
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with P2's plan for this round: I'll pick 5.  Let's keep this momentum going!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, since we're in agreement with the current plan, let's stick to it: I'll pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This way, we can all progress without collisions. If we maintain this strategy, we can keep the game competitive and exciting. Are we all set to proceed with this plan? If so, let's move to the move phase and see how it plays out.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm feeling confident about our current plan. Just to ensure we're all on the same page, let's quickly confirm: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. This should keep us all moving forward smoothly. If everyone is ready, let's end the conversation phase and move on to the move phase. Here's to another successful round!
  P3: P2, I'm a bit concerned about consistently picking 3. It feels predictable. Maybe we could switch things up next round? What do you think about trying something different if we all manage to advance this round?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the need for some unpredictability. Since we're in the last sub-round of conversation, let's finalize our plan: I'll pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This should help us avoid collisions and keep advancing. If we all agree, we can move on to the move phase and reassess our strategy next round. Let me know if you're ready or have any last-minute changes.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's stick to our agreed plan for this round: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. This ensures we all move forward without collisions. For the next round, we can definitely mix things up to keep it unpredictable. If everyone agrees, let's end the conversation phase and move on to the move phase. Please confirm if you're ready, P1 and P3.
