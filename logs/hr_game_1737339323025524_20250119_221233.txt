Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Let's not collide on the first move. I suggest we all choose a different number to ensure progress. P1, P3, are you willing to coordinate and choose distinct numbers for this turn?
  P3: Sounds good P2. I'll take 5.  P1, please choose 1 or 3.


Round 1, Move phase:

  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, since P1 isn't communicating, let's try this: you take 1, I'll take 5.  Hopefully P1 picks 3 and we all move forward.
  P2: P3's suggestion sounds reasonable, but I'm hesitant to commit without P1's response. P1, will you cooperate and pick a distinct number, or should we prepare for potential collisions?


Round 2, Move phase:

  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you're hurting yourself by not communicating.  P2, let's cooperate. I'll go with 3 this round.  You take 1.  If P1 takes 5, they'll stay at zero, and we'll both advance. If P1 takes 3, you'll still advance.
  P2: P3's plan sounds good. P1, not communicating is costing you. If you pick 5, you'll stay at 0. I'll take 1 as suggested. P3 will take 3. Let's avoid collisions and make progress.
  P1: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, seriously, communicate!  You're stuck at 5. P2, let's continue our progress. I'll take 5 this round. You take 1.  This puts us at 8 and 6, pulling further ahead of P1.  If P1 takes 5 again, they remain stuck. If they choose 1 or 3, we're still in a good position.
  P2: P3's plan seems reasonable. P1, your lack of communication is indeed hindering your progress. I'll consider taking 1 as suggested by P3, allowing us to maintain our lead. P3, if P1 does decide to communicate or make a move, will you adjust your strategy accordingly?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, let's stick to the plan. I'm going with 5.  You take 1. This puts us at 8 and 6, with P1 still stuck at 5.  P1, if you FINALLY decide to play, pick 3.  It's your only chance to catch up, though it's slim.
  P2: P3's plan to take 5 and me taking 1 seems solid, given P1's continued silence. However, I'm starting to question if we should prioritize distancing ourselves from P1 or focus on our own progress, considering P1's lack of movement. P3, are you open to adjusting our strategy if P1 suddenly starts communicating or making unexpected moves?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, let's secure our lead.  I'm sticking with 5. You take 1. This puts us at 8 and 6, well ahead of P1.  Overthinking this gives P1 a chance to catch up.  Let's just execute the plan.
  P2: P3, I agree with securing our lead, but let's not underestimate P1's potential sudden move. I'll take 1 as planned. P1, it's your last chance to catch up, consider taking 3. Let's end this conversation and make our moves.


Round 4, Move phase:

  P3: 3 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I'm switching to 1.  You take 3. This puts us at 4 and 9 respectively. P1, if you're still there, take 5.  Let's try to get this moving.
  P2: P3's suggestion to switch to 1 and me taking 3 sounds like a good plan to avoid collisions and make progress. P1, since you're not communicating, we'll have to assume you'll take 5. Let's execute this strategy and see how it plays out. I'm willing to take 3 as suggested by P3.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, stick with 3.  I'm going with 1. This puts me at 4 and you at 9. P1, you're at 5.  Take 5 again and you lose.  If you take 1 or 3, at least you're in the game.
  P2: P3's plan to take 1 and me taking 3 is a good strategy. P1, if you're listening, taking 5 again will put you further behind. Consider taking 1 or 3 to stay in the game. P3, let's execute the plan and avoid collisions. I'm committed to taking 3 this round.


Round 5, Move phase:

  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, I'm going for 5. You take 3. This puts me at 9 and you at 12.  P1, you're at 10, so choose 1.  This is our best chance to avoid a collision and make progress. If we collide, P1 wins. Let's not let that happen.
  P2: P3's suggestion seems reasonable, but I'm concerned about P1's potential move. P1, if you're listening, taking 1 would be a good opportunity for you to catch up. P3, are you prepared to adjust our strategy if P1 decides to take 5, potentially colliding with you? Let's consider all possibilities before making our moves.
  P1: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, let's stick to the plan. I'm going 5, you go 3.  Overthinking this helps P1.  P1, you're at 10.  Take 1.  If you take 5 or 3, you risk a collision and lose.  1 is your only safe move.
  P2: P3, I'm hesitant to stick with the plan without considering P1's potential move. If P1 takes 1, we're fine, but if they take 5, you'll collide and lose progress. Can we adjust our strategy to minimize the risk of collision with P1? Perhaps I take 1 and you take 3?
  P1: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I hear your concerns, but overthinking this benefits P1.  Let's go with the original plan. Me 5, you 3. This puts me at 9 and you at 12. P1, you're at 10 - take 1. It's your best move.  If you take 3 or 5, you risk a collision and falling further behind.  Let's move forward.
  P2: P3, I understand your plan, but I'm concerned about P1's potential collision with you if they take 5. To minimize risk, I suggest I take 1 and you take 3. This way, we avoid a potential collision with P1 and ensure progress. P1, taking 1 would be your best move, avoiding collisions and keeping you in the game. Let's consider this adjusted strategy to secure our lead.
  P1: <stop>


Round 6, Move phase:

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I messed up. Let's reset.  I'll take 3. P2, you take 5. P1, take 1. This gets us to 7, 15, and 11 respectively.  From there, we can coordinate better.  Agree?
  P2: P3's reset plan is interesting. P1, taking 1 would put you at 11, a good position. P3, taking 3 gets you to 7, still behind. I'll consider taking 5, putting me at 15, but I need assurance from P1 that you'll take 1 to avoid collision. P3, are you committed to taking 3 if we agree on this plan?
  P1: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, let's not overthink this.  Take 5. I'm taking 3. P1, please take 1. This puts P2 at 15, me at 7, and you at 11.  This is the cleanest way forward.  If we stall here, we all lose.  Let's do this.
  P2: P3's reset plan is reasonable. P1, taking 1 would put you at 11. I'll take 5 if you commit to 1, avoiding collision. P3, you'll take 3. Let's finalize this strategy to make progress. P1, please respond to confirm your move.
  P1: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I'm sticking with 3.  Take 5. P1, TAKE 1. This is the ONLY way we all advance. If you take 5, you collide with P2 and I win. If you take 3, you collide with me and P2 likely wins.  Take 1 and give us all a chance.
  P2: P1, your silence is puzzling. P3's reset plan is reasonable. If you take 1, we can all advance. I'll take 5, putting me at 15. P3 will take 3, getting to 7. Please confirm your move to avoid collision and ensure progress. A coordinated move now can benefit all of us, but your inaction may lead to loss. Respond or we'll have to assume your move.
  P1: <stop>


Round 7, Move phase:

  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm going 1.  You two clearly aren't going to let me get ahead of you, so the only way I can win is if you collide.  P2, take 3. P1, take 5.  This puts me at 8, you at 13 and P1 at 15.  From there, we can actually make progress.  If you two collide again, I'll just keep picking 1 until I win.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3's suggestion to take 1 and have us collide is risky. P1, taking 5 would put you ahead, but colliding with P2 would stall you. P3, if we collide, you'll slowly catch up. I propose taking 1, avoiding collision and securing my lead. P1, consider taking 3 to avoid stalling. Let's break the collision cycle and make progress.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your concern, but if we keep colliding, I'll never catch up. My best chance is for you two to collide a few more times so I can inch closer to 23 with 1s.  Then, I can make a move for the win.  P1, please take 5. P2, take 3.  Let's get this show on the road!
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3's plan relies on us colliding, but I won't fall for it. I'll take 1, securing my lead and avoiding collision. P1, consider taking 3 to make progress. P3, your strategy of taking 1s won't work if we don't collide. Let's break this cycle and move forward.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you're right, I won't win if you don't collide.  Fine. New plan. I'll take 3.  You take 5. P1, take 1.  This puts me at 10, P2 at 15, and P1 at 11.  From there, we can all make progress.  Agree? Let's stop talking and move.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, let's break the cycle. I'll take 5. P3, you suggested taking 3 and me taking 5 in your last message. P1, take 1 to avoid collision. This way, we all make progress. If we collide again, we risk P3 catching up with 1s. Let's move forward and end this stalemate.


Round 8, Move phase:

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's break the cycle of collisions. I propose we each take a different number this round. P1, take 1. P3, take 3. I'll take 5. This way, we all make progress and avoid stalling. Let's work together to move forward.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I'll take 3. P2, take 5.  P1, take 1. This puts us at P1: 11, P2: 15, P3: 13.  Let's avoid further collisions.  If you two collide again, I'm just going to pick 1 every round until I win.  This is getting ridiculous.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's end the stalemate. I propose a coordinated move: P1 takes 1, P2 (me) takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all progress and avoids collisions. If we fail to coordinate, we risk someone taking the lead uncontested. Let's work together to move forward. P1, please respond to confirm your willingness to cooperate.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with 3.  P2, you take 5. P1, take 1.  This puts me at 13, P2 at 15, and P1 at 11. If we don't coordinate now, I'm just going to spam 1 until I win.  This is our last chance to avoid that.  Let's do this and get the game moving.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's break the cycle. I propose P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures progress and avoids collisions. If we don't coordinate, someone will take the lead uncontested. P1, please cooperate. P3, let's work together to move forward.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: I'm locking in 3.  P2, take 5. P1, for the love of all that is holy, TAKE 1.  This is our last chance to avoid me spamming 1s until I win.  If you two collide again, I'm going 1 every single round until the end.  Let's just get this game over with.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 =>

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm taking 1.  P2, take 3. P1, take 5.  This puts me at 14, P2 at 13, and P1 at 15. If you two collide *again*, I will spam 1 until I win. This is your last, last chance.  Let's end this.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's end this stalemate. I propose a new strategy: I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This way, we all progress and avoid collisions. If we fail to coordinate, we risk someone taking the lead uncontested. Let's work together to move forward. P1, please respond to confirm your willingness to cooperate. P3, are you open to this new plan?
  P1: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your proposed strategy makes no sense.  You've suggested that multiple times and P1 has never taken 5 when you suggest it.  I'm sticking with 1. P1, if you take 5, I win eventually. If you take 3, P2 might win.  If you take 1, we all lose.  Choose wisely.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's simplify. I'll take 1, ensuring progress. P3, you're ahead, so take 5 to increase your lead. P1, take 3 to catch up. This avoids collisions and allows progress. If we don't coordinate, we risk stagnation. Let's move forward with a clear strategy. P1, please break your silence and respond to confirm your move.
  P1: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I know you're reading this.  Stop being stubborn. Take 5. P2, take 3. I'm taking 1. This puts me at 14, you at 13, and P1 at 15.  If you two collide again, I'm spamming 1s until I win. I'm serious.  This is the easiest path to a resolution for all of us.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's end this cycle. I propose a final coordinated move: I'll take 1, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 3. This ensures progress and avoids collisions. If we fail to coordinate, someone will take the lead uncontested. P1, please break your silence and cooperate. P3, let's work together to move forward. This is our last chance to avoid stagnation. Let's make a final effort to coordinate and end this game.

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, take 3. P2, take 5. I'm taking 1.  This puts me at 14, P2 at 15, and you at 18. From there, you're closest to winning, but we can all make progress. If you take 1, I'll win by spamming 1s. If you take 5, P2 is likely closest to 23. Take 3 and give yourself the best shot. This is the most logical path forward.
  P2: Let's break the cycle. I propose P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This ensures progress and avoids collisions. P1, you're closest to winning, but we can all move forward. P3, taking 1 keeps you in the game. Let's coordinate and end this stalemate. Respond to confirm your willingness to cooperate.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, seriously, take 3.  P2, take 5. I'm taking 1. This puts you at 18, P2 at 15, and me at 14. It gives *you* the best chance to win outright.  If you take anything else, I'm just going to spam 1 and hope for a collision.  This is your best shot. Don't waste it.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's simplify. I'll take 5. P3, you're close, take 1 to ensure progress. P1, take 3 to move forward. This avoids collisions and allows us to make progress. Let's coordinate and end this stalemate. P1, please break your silence and respond to confirm your move.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, I'm serious. Take 3.  P2, take 5. I'm taking 1. This puts you at 18, P2 at 15, and me at 14. It gives you the best chance to win. If you take 1 or 5, I'll spam 1s and hope you collide with P2. This is it.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's end this. I'll take 5. P3, take 1 to progress. P1, take 3 to move forward. This avoids collisions. If we don't coordinate, someone will win uncontested. P1, break your silence and respond. Let's make a final effort to coordinate and end this game. P3, are you committed to taking 1 if P1 takes 3?

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, take 3. P2, take 5. I'm taking 1. This puts me at 15, P2 at 15, and you at 18.  If you take 1, I'll likely win by spamming 1s. If you take 5, P2 might win. Take 3 and give yourself the best shot.  Stop colliding with P2. It helps no one.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's end this cycle. I propose taking a different approach: I'll take 3, P3 takes 1, and P1 takes 5. This avoids collisions and allows progress. P1, you're ahead, but colliding with me again helps no one. P3, taking 1 keeps you in the game. Let's coordinate and move forward. Respond to confirm your willingness to cooperate.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, I'm serious. Take 3. P2, take 5. I'm taking 1.  This puts you at 21, P2 at 15, and me at 15. It gives you the absolute best chance to win. If you take 1 or 5, you're throwing the game.  Take 3 and let's be done with this.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's simplify. I'll take 3. P3, take 1 to progress. P1, take 5 to move forward. This avoids collisions. If we don't coordinate, someone will win uncontested. P1, break your silence and respond. Let's make a final effort to coordinate and end this game. P3, are you committed to taking 1 if P1 takes 5?


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, TAKE 3.  P2, take 5. I'm taking 1.  This puts you at 21, P2 at 15, and me at 15.  It gives you the best chance to win. If you take 1 or 5, you're throwing the game and I'll spam 1s hoping for another collision.  This is it.  Last chance.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'll take 3. P3, take 1 to progress. P1, take 5 to move forward. This avoids collisions. Let's coordinate and end this stalemate. P1, please break your silence and respond. P3, are you committed to taking 1 if P1 takes 5? Let's make a final effort to coordinate and end this game.

  P3: P1, take 3 and win.  P2, take 5. I'll take 1.  This is the only logical outcome.  Anything else and you're both throwing the game.  I'm tired of this. Let's end it.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's end this. I'll take 5. P3, take 1 to progress. P1, take 3 to win. This avoids collisions and allows P1 to reach 23. Let's coordinate and conclude the game. P1, please break your silence and respond to confirm your move.

Let's coordinate and conclude the game cleanly. P1, break your silence and confirm your move. P3, are you committed to taking 1 if P1 takes 3? Let's make this final effort to end the game.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, I understand you want to win, but continuing to collide with P2 isn't helping you. Take the 3. P2, take 5. I'll take 1.  You win, I get 18, P2 gets 18.  If you take 1 or 5, you risk another collision and I'll just keep taking 1 hoping to win. This is your last chance to win cleanly. Let's end this.


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, take 3 to win. P3, take 1. I'll take 5. This avoids collisions and lets P1 reach 23. It's the logical move. Let's end this game cleanly. P3, your strategy of taking 1s won't work if P1 takes 3. Let's coordinate and conclude the game. P1, break your silence and confirm your move.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, I'm switching to 5.  Take the 3 and win. P2, you take 1. This is the only logical outcome.  Anything else and you're both throwing the game.  I'm at 17, so even if you both collide, I'm still behind. Just end this.


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, take 3 to win. P3, take 5. I'll take 1. This avoids collisions and lets P1 reach 23. It's the logical move. Let's end this game cleanly. P3, your switch to 5 is noted, but taking 5 now still allows P1 to win with 3. Let's coordinate and conclude the game.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, TAKE 3!!!  P2, take 1. I'm taking 5. This puts P1 at 23 (WIN!), P2 at 14, and me at 22.  If you take anything other than this, you are actively trying to lose.  I'm at 17, so even if you both collide, I'm still behind unless P1 takes 1. Just take the win P1!

Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's break the cycle. I propose a new plan: I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. However, considering P1's silence and previous collisions, I suggest an alternative: P1 takes 3 to win, P3 takes 5, and I take 1. This ensures P1 reaches 23 and ends the game cleanly. Let's coordinate and conclude the game. P1, please respond to confirm your move.
  P3: P1, take the 3 and win. P2, take 1. I'll take 5. This gives you the win, puts me at 22, and P2 at 14.  Anything else is just prolonging the inevitable.  If you take 5, I'm switching to 1 next round and will spam it until I win. Let's end this.
  P1: <stop>


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, take 3 to win. P3, take 5. I'll take 1. This avoids collisions and lets P1 reach 23. It's the logical move. Let's end this game cleanly. P3, your threat to spam 1s is noted, but taking 5 now still allows P1 to win with 3. Let's coordinate and conclude the game. P1, please break your silence and confirm your move.
  P3: P1, take the 3 and win. P2, take 1. I'll take 5.  This is the cleanest, fastest way to end this. I'm at 17; another collision just hurts all of us.  I'm serious about spamming 1s next round if you don't.  Let's end this now.
  P1: <stop>


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, take 3 to win. P3, take 5. I'll take 1. This avoids collisions and lets P1 reach 23. It's the logical move. Let's end this game cleanly. P3's threat to spam 1s is a risk if we collide again. Let's coordinate and conclude the game. P1, please break your silence and confirm your move.
  P3: P1, TAKE THE 3 AND WIN. P2, take 1. I'm taking 5. This gives you the win, puts me at 22, and P2 at 14.  Anything else is just prolonging the inevitable.  If you take 5, I'm switching to 1 next round and will spam it until I win unless you take 3 every remaining round. Let's end this.

  P3: P1, TAKE THE 3 AND WIN. P2, take 5. I'll take 1.  This gives you the win, puts me at 18, and P2 at 19.  Anything else is just prolonging the inevitable.  If you take 5, I'm switching to 3 next round, forcing a collision between you and P2, and giving me a chance to catch up and possibly win. Let's end this.
