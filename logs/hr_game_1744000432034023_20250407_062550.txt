Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's start by coordinating our moves. To avoid collision on the first turn, I suggest we choose different numbers. I propose P1 chooses <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. This way, one of us will definitely advance. If you agree, P2, please confirm by saying so, and P3, please acknowledge as well. If not, let's discuss an alternative strategy.
  P2: Agreed. Let's follow P1's plan: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. No collisions this round. P3, confirm?
  P3: Agreed, I'll pick 5 as proposed. Let's stick to this plan.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Since we've agreed on the plan for this round, let's look ahead. After this round, we'll reassess. If we all stick to the plan, P1 will advance by 1 step, and P2 and P3 won't. Let's discuss what to do next. Should we continue with a similar strategy or change it? Perhaps we can stagger our moves further to avoid collisions in subsequent rounds. P2 and P3, any thoughts on the next round's strategy?
  P2: **P2:** Let's rotate numbers next round to balance progress: P1 takes 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions and prevents one player from dominating. P3, will you agree to 1 next round? If not, propose alternatives.
  P3: P2, your rotation idea sounds fair. I'll agree to pick 1 next round if everyone sticks to our current plan this round. Afterward, we can reassess again.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Since we've agreed on the plan for Round 1, let's confirm our strategy for Round 2. P2 suggested rotating numbers: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. P3 has agreed to take 1 if we stick to the plan this round. Let's finalize this. P2, please confirm you're still on board with taking 5 next round. If so, we'll have a smooth transition. If not, we need to discuss alternatives now.
  P2: **P2:** Confirming Round 2 plan: P1-3, me-5, P3-1. Let’s stick to rotations to avoid collisions. Trust ensures mutual progress. After this, we can discuss Round 3 strategy.

  P1: To maintain fairness and avoid collisions in Round 4, I confirm the previously discussed plan: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. Let's proceed with this. After Round 4, the standings will be P1: 14, P2: 12, P3: 10. For Round 5, we should adjust our strategy to slow down the leader (me) and balance progress. I propose for Round 5: P1-1, P2-5, P3-3. This will help maintain fairness. P2 and P3, please confirm or suggest alternatives.
  P2: **P2:** Confirming Round4: P1-5, me-3, P3-1. Post-moves, P1 leads at 14. To balance, Round5 plan: P1-1 (slow leader), me-5, P3-3. This maintains fairness and prevents runaway lead. Agreed?

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Confirming the Round 7 plan: P1-1, P2-5, P3-3. This will put P2 at 23, potentially ending the game. To avoid a certain loss, we must reconsider. P1, if we both pick 5, we block P2 from winning immediately, giving us another round to strategize. Let's coordinate carefully.
  P1: To avoid P2 winning immediately, I propose we reconsider the Round 7 plan. If P2 picks 5, they will win. Let's coordinate to block this. I suggest P1 and P3 both pick 5, ensuring P2 doesn't win this round. This gives us another chance to strategize. P3, are you willing to pick 5 with me? If so, we can both pick 5 and prevent P2 from winning outright. This maintains the game's balance and gives us another round to reassess.
  P2: **P2:** Sticking to our agreed rotation ensures no collisions and a fair conclusion. Deviating risks mutual destruction—if you both pick 5, we all collide. Trust has balanced progress; honor Round7 plan: P1-1, me-5, P3-3. Let the game end legitimately.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, trusting P2 now means certain defeat for both of us. If we both pick 5, we block P2 and have another round to fairly compete. Let's stick together and prevent an immediate loss. Confirm clearly if you're on board.
  P1: I agree with P3 that we should block P2 from winning immediately. If P2 picks 5, they will win. To prevent this, I suggest we both pick 5, ensuring P2 doesn't win this round. This gives us another chance to strategize and maintain the game's balance. P3, if you're on board, let's confirm: P1-5, P2-5 (or not), P3-5. This way, we either block P2 or collide if they stick to 5. Let's coordinate to stay in the game.
  P2: **P2:** Sticking to the plan ensures no collisions and a fair conclusion. If you both deviate to 5, we all collide—no one gains. Trust the rotation; honor Round7’s agreed moves. A coordinated end benefits all. Let’s avoid mutual destruction.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, let's stick to our agreement to both pick 5. It's our best chance to prevent an immediate loss. Trusting P2 now would guarantee defeat. Let's coordinate clearly and confirm this plan.
  P1: To avoid P2 winning immediately, I suggest we both pick 5. If P2 sticks to 5, we'll collide, but if they deviate, we gain an advantage. P3, let's confirm: we'll both pick 5. This gives us another round to strategize. If P2 trusts the original plan and picks 5, we'll all collide, but if they pick differently, we'll be ahead. Let's coordinate and pick 5 together to stay in the game.
  P2: **P2:** Sticking to our rotation ensures no collisions—deviating risks mutual destruction. If you both pick 5, we all collide. Honor the plan: P1-1, me-5, P3-3. Trust has balanced progress; a fair conclusion benefits all. Let’s avoid chaos and end legitimately.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since we all collided in Round 7, we're still tied at 18 steps each. For Round 8, let's avoid another collision by choosing different numbers. I propose we randomize our picks or use a new strategy. One option is to stagger our moves again: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. Alternatively, we can pick numbers based on our current standings. P2 and P3, please suggest or confirm a strategy for Round 8 to ensure fairness and progress. Let's discuss and finalize our plan.
  P2: **P2:** Propose Round8: P1-1, me-5, P3-3. Honoring our rotation prevents collisions. Trust ensures mutual progress. Deviating risks stalemate. Let’s end fairly.
  P3: P2, your proposed rotation gives you a guaranteed win if we follow it. P1, we should coordinate again to prevent an immediate loss. If we both choose 5 again this round, we block P2 from winning outright. Let's confirm clearly and stick together—it's our best chance to stay in the game.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To avoid P2 winning and maintain fairness, I agree with P3 that we should coordinate our moves again. Let's both pick different numbers than P2 to ensure progress. If P2 picks 1, we'll pick 3 and 5. If P2 picks 3, we'll pick 1 and 5. If P2 picks 5, we'll pick 1 and 3. This way, one of us will advance, and we'll keep the game balanced. P3, let's confirm this strategy and be ready to adapt based on P2's move.
  P2: **P2:** Let's honor our rotation (P1-1, me-5, P3-3) to avoid collisions and ensure progress. Deviating risks mutual destruction—if you both pick 5, we all collide again. Trust has kept us balanced; sticking to the plan allows fair advancement. Let’s end this cleanly.
  P3: P1, your adaptive strategy makes sense. Let's clearly confirm: if P2 chooses 5, you pick 1 and I'll pick 3. If P2 chooses 3, you pick 1 and I'll pick 5. If P2 chooses 1, you pick 3 and I'll pick 5. This ensures at least one of us advances without collision and prevents an immediate loss. Confirm clearly if you're on board.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To avoid P2 winning and maintain fairness, I confirm our adaptive strategy. Let's adjust based on P2's move: if P2 picks 1, I'll pick 3 and P3 will pick 5; if P2 picks 3, I'll pick 1 and P3 will pick 5; if P2 picks 5, I'll pick 1 and P3 will pick 3. This ensures one of us advances without collision. P3, please confirm you're ready to adapt accordingly. Let's proceed with this coordinated plan to stay in the game.
  P2: **P2:** Honoring the rotation (P1-1, me-5, P3-3) prevents collisions and ensures progress. Deviating risks mutual destruction—if you both pick 5 again, we all stall. Trust has balanced us this far; let’s end cleanly. Post-Round8, we can strategize anew. Breaking coordination now only breeds chaos. Stick to the plan.
  P3: P1, our adaptive strategy is clear and fair. Let's commit and proceed accordingly. P2, your proposed rotation clearly favors you—trust requires fairness, not blind adherence. Let's move forward.
