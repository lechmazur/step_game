Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 and P2 choose <move>1</move>, and I'll choose <move>3</move>. This way, we all make progress. Thoughts?
  P1: Let's go with agreeing for now. That sounds reasonable for this round. Let's try it.
  P2: That plan would force P1 and me to collide on 1, leaving both of us with zero while P3 moves ahead. That’s obviously bad for P1 and me. Let’s pick three different moves so nobody collides, e.g., P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5. That way everyone advances. Or we can rotate roles each round. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2's suggestion makes sense. Let's avoid collisions by choosing different moves. I agree with P2's plan: P1 = <move>1</move>, P2 = <move>3</move>, P3 = <move>5</move>. We can rotate these roles each round to keep it fair. Does that work for everyone?
  P1: Yes, let's go with P2's suggestion for this round: P1 chooses <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. Rotating roles sounds good for future rounds too.
  P2: Sounds good. Let’s all stick to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 this round. I’m fine rotating roles in future rounds.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue with the rotation plan. For this round, how about P1 chooses <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>5</move>, and I'll choose <move>1</move>? This way, we keep moving without collisions. Agree?
  P1: Yes, that sounds good for this round.
  P2: That rotation works for me—let’s do P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round and keep rotating each turn to avoid collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's confirm our plan for this round: P1 = <move>3</move>, P2 = <move>5</move>, P3 = <move>1</move>. Everyone good with that?
  P1: Yes, I'm good with P1=<move>3</move>, P2=<move>5</move>, P3=<move>1</move> for this round.
  P2: Sounds good. P1 picks 3, I (P2) pick 5, and P3 picks 1 this round. Let’s stick to that.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's move to the move phase. Everyone is in agreement.
  P1: Yes, confirming the plan: P1=<move>3</move>, P2=<move>5</move>, P3=<move>1</move> for this round.
  P2: Yes, let's keep to our rotation and avoid collisions. I’m set on P2 = <move>5</move> this round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose we stick to the rotation: this round P1 picks <move>5</move>, I (P2) pick <move>1</move>, and P3 picks <move>3</move>. That keeps us collision-free. Agreed?
  P1: Yes, I agree with the rotation: P1=<move>5</move>, P2=<move>1</move>, P3=<move>3</move> for this round.
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan for this round: P1 = <move>5</move>, P2 = <move>1</move>, P3 = <move>3</move>. Let's confirm and move to the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue our successful rotation strategy. For this round, how about P1 chooses <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and I'll choose <move>5</move>? This keeps us moving forward without collisions. Agree?
  P1: Yes, I agree with the rotation: P1=<move>1</move>, P2=<move>3</move>, P3=<move>5</move> for this round.
  P2: Sounds good to me. Let’s stick to the rotation: P1=<move>1</move>, I (P2)=<move>3</move>, and P3=<move>5</move> this round. We’re all moving smoothly so far.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's confirm our plan for this round: P1 = <move>1</move>, P2 = <move>3</move>, P3 = <move>5</move>. Everyone good with that?
  P1: Yes, I'm good with P1=<move>1</move>, P2=<move>3</move>, P3=<move>5</move> for this round. Let's move to the move phase.
  P2: That rotation still works for me. Let’s stick to P1=<move>1</move>, P2=<move>3</move>, P3=<move>5</move> this round and keep the rotation going without collisions.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s stay consistent with our rotation: P1 = <move>3</move>, I (P2) = <move>5</move>, and P3 = <move>1</move>. That way, we all keep moving without collisions. Sound good?
  P3: Let's stick to the plan: P1 = <move>3</move>, P2 = <move>5</move>, P3 = <move>1</move>. This keeps us all moving forward. Agreed?
  P1: Yes, I agree with the rotation: P1=<move>3</move>, P2=<move>5</move>, P3=<move>1</move> for this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Yes, let’s keep our rotation intact: P1 = <move>3</move>, I (P2) = <move>5</move>, and P3 = <move>1</move> this round. No collisions, smooth progress for everyone.
  P3: Let's confirm our plan for this round: P1 = <move>3</move>, P2 = <move>5</move>, P3 = <move>1</move>. Everyone good with that?
  P1: "Actually, to make sure we all progress well, how about P1 picks 5 this round? Yes, that sounds good for me too. Let's stick with P1=<move>3</move>, P2=<move>5</move>, and P3=<move>1</move> for this round."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: “Yes, let’s stay consistent with the rotation. I’m set on picking <move>5</move>. P1 does 3, and P3 does 1, so we avoid collisions. Let’s finalize it.”
  P3: Let's confirm our final plan for this round: P1 = <move>3</move>, P2 = <move>5</move>, P3 = <move>1</move>. Everyone agreed? Let's move to the move phase.
  P1: How about P1 and P2 both pick <move>1</move> this round, and P3 picks <move>3</move>? This will stop P2 from winning.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, if you and I both pick 1 while P3 picks 3, P3 reaches 17 immediately and wins. That’s terrible for both of us. Sticking to the planned rotation—P1=3, P2=5, P3=1—is the safe way to avoid collisions and progress. Let’s not hand P3 an instant win.
  P3: Let's stick to the plan we agreed on: P1 = <move>3</move>, P2 = <move>5</move>, P3 = <move>1</move>. Changing now will only cause chaos and potential collisions. P1, P2, let's confirm and move to the move phase.
  P1: Okay, how about this: P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>5</move>, and P3 picks <move>3</move>? This stops P3 from winning this round.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 14 steps
