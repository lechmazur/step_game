Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all pick different numbers this round to get a good start. I'm thinking of picking 3.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Sounds good to me. I'll go with 1.  P3, what are you thinking?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:

  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, so P3 and I collided. Let's try again to pick different numbers. I'll pick 5 this time. P1, you should stick with 1, and P3, maybe pick 3?
  P1: P2, I appreciate the suggestion, but I think I'll choose 3 this round. P3, how about you go with 1?  This way we all advance.
  P3: <stop>


Round 2, Move phase:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, since you haven't moved yet, why don't you take 1 this round?  P2, you're in the lead, so how about you choose 5 again? That way we all move forward.
  P2: P1, I will pick 1 this round. P3, please pick 5. That will get us all moving.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I understand you want to pick 1, but that puts us in direct competition again.  Let's stick to the original plan:  I'll take 3, you take 5, and P3 takes 1.  This is the fastest way for all of us to progress. P3, please confirm you'll take 1.
  P2: Okay, P1, I understand your point. I'll go with 5. P3, please pick 1. Let's get everyone moving this turn.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm sticking with 3.  P2, please choose 5. P3, if you choose 1, we all advance. If you choose 3, you hurt both of us and help P2. If you choose 5, you hurt yourself and P2.  The logical choice is 1.
  P2: Okay, P1, I'm sticking with 5. P3, please choose 1. Let's all move this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, I understand you're being quiet, but this is hurting all of us.  Taking 1 is the ONLY way you move forward this round.  If you pick 3 or 5, you stay at zero.  Let's all agree and get this game moving.  I'm choosing 3. P2 is choosing 5.  Your turn, P3.  Choose 1.
  P2: Okay, P1, I'm sticking with 5. P3, please choose 1. Let's all move this round.


Round 3, Move phase:

  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, I'm going to choose 1 this round.  P2, you're in the lead, so the best choice for you is 5 to maximize your chances of winning. If you choose anything else, you risk colliding with me and letting P3 catch up.  Let's make this round productive.
  P2: Okay, P1, I will pick 3 this round. P3, please pick 1. This will let us both move forward and keep the pressure on P3.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, choosing 3 puts you at risk of colliding with P3.  If P3 chooses 1, they finally get on the board, and if they choose 3, neither of you move.  Sticking with 5 is your safest bet. P3, I'm sticking with 1.  Choose 3 to get on the board.  This is the most logical progression for all of us.
  P2: Okay, P1, I understand your concern. I will stick with 5 this round. P3, please pick 1. This will allow us all to move forward.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, thank you for cooperating. P3, I understand you haven't moved yet, and you're likely frustrated.  However, continuing to block us both only hurts your chances.  If you choose 3 this round, you will finally advance.  I'm sticking with 1. P2 is choosing 5. This is the clearest path to all of us making progress.  Choose 3, P3. Let's get this game moving.
  P2: Okay, P1, I'm sticking with 5. P3, please pick 1. Let's all move forward this round. It's the only way for you to get on the board, and it allows P1 and I to advance.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I'm locking in 1. P2, I know you said 5, but choosing 3 this round gives you the highest chance of winning. If you choose 5, you risk P3 finally choosing 5 and staying at 10 while I advance to 6.  If P3 chooses 3, you both stay put, and I advance to 6.  Choosing 3 puts you at 13, a strong position, and guarantees you move forward.  Trust me.
  P2: Okay, P1, I see your point about choosing 3. I'll go with 3 this round. P3, please choose 1. It's still the only way for you to get on the board, and it allows P1 and I to advance.
  P3: <stop>

  P3: 0 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, I'm going with 5 this round.  P2, your best bet is 1.  If you choose 3, you risk staying at 10.  If you choose 5, you collide with me and stay at 10.  Choosing 1 puts you at 15 and in a commanding lead.  Let's get this game finished.  P3, choose 3.
  P2: Okay, P1, I will choose 1 this round. P3, please pick 5. This will get you on the board and allow P1 and I to move forward. I think it's the best strategy for all of us at this point.
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand wanting P3 to get on the board, but them choosing 5 this round doesn't help *you* win.  You need to maximize *your* score.  Stick with 1.  P3, I'm going 5. Your only logical choice is 3.  Anything else keeps you at zero.  Let's finish this.
  P2: Okay, P1, I'm sticking with 1. P3, please pick 5. Let's get you on the board and allow P1 and I to move forward. This is the best way for all of us to make progress this round.
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, stick with 1.  P3, I'm serious, choose 3.  Continuing to block like this is pointless.  You're at zero.  You HAVE to move forward.  This isn't helping anyone, least of all you.  Choose 3 and let's end this.
  P2: Okay, P1, I'm sticking with 1. P3, please pick 5. Let's get you on the board and allow P1 and I to move forward. This is the best way for all of us to make progress this round.
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I'm begging you. Choose 3.  You're at zero.  You can't win from zero.  Let's all get this game over with.  P2, I'm sticking with 5.  You choose 1 and jump to 15, giving you a great shot to win.  This is it. Let's finish this round.
  P2: Okay, P1, I'm sticking with 1. P3, please pick 5. Let's get you on the board and allow P1 and I to move forward. This is the best way for all of us to make progress this round.
