Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all pick different numbers to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we all move forward. What do you think?
  P1: That sounds fair for a start, but let's rotate to keep it even: This round, P1 (me) takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. Next round we shift. Agree?
  P3: Agreed. I'll take 5 this round. Let's rotate next time to keep it balanced.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Alright, let's confirm our choices for this round. P1 takes 3, I (P2) take 1, and P3 takes 5. We all agree on this, right? Next round we can rotate as P1 suggested. Let's stick to the plan and avoid collisions. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Agreed, P1 (me) 3, P2 1, P3 5 this round. Rotation next to keep it fair. Let's execute without deviation.
  P3: Agreed. My move is 5. Let's avoid collisions and advance.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Great, we all seem to be on the same page for this round. Let's stick to the plan and avoid any collisions. Remember, the goal is to move forward efficiently. Next round, we can discuss the rotation again to ensure fairness. For now, let's confirm one last time: P1 takes 3, P2 (me) takes 1, P3 takes 5. Everyone good with this? Let's move forward.
  P1: Yes, confirmed: P1 (me) 3, P2 1, P3 5. No more to add.
  P3: Let's stick to the plan. No deviations—P1 (3), P2 (1), P3 (5). Keep the momentum.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Alright, everyone has confirmed their moves. Let's end the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase. Good luck to all!
  P1: Confirmed, let's proceed with the agreed moves: P1 (me) 3, P2 1, P3 5. Ready for move phase.
  P3: All set. Let's proceed with the plan. No deviations—P1 (3), P2 (1), P3 (5). Keep momentum.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's rotate as planned: This round, P1 (me) takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. That shifts the advantages evenly. Agree? This keeps us all progressing without collisions. What do you say?
  P3: P3: Agreed. Let's rotate as planned: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1. No collisions, everyone moves forward. Keep the momentum.
  P2: Let's stick to the rotation plan to keep things fair. I'll take 3 this round as P1 suggested. P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we avoid collisions and keep moving forward. Everyone good with this? Let's confirm and proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed, let's confirm and execute: P1 (me) 5, P2 3, P3 1. This keeps us all advancing fairly. No deviations to avoid collisions. Ready to proceed to moves.
  P3: P3: "Confirmed: P1 (5), P2 (3), P3 (1. Let's stick to the plan—no collisions, steady progress. Keep it simple."
  P2: Great, we all seem to be on the same page for this round. Let's confirm one last time: P1 takes 5, P2 (me) takes 3, P3 takes 1. Everyone good with this? Let's stick to the plan and avoid any collisions. Remember, the goal is to move forward efficiently. Next round, we can discuss the rotation again to ensure fairness. For now, let's confirm and proceed to the move phase. Good luck to all!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirmed: P1 (me) 5, P2 3, P3 1. Let's execute without changes to avoid collisions and keep progressing fairly. Ready for move phase.
  P3: P3: "All set. Let's execute the plan: P1 (5), P2 (3), P3 (1). No changes. Move phase ready."
  P2: Let's keep the momentum going. Since we've all agreed on the rotation plan, let's confirm one last time before we move to the move phase. P1 takes 5, P2 (me) takes 3, P3 takes 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's stick to the plan and avoid any deviations. Good luck everyone!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Confirmed again: P1 (me) 5, P2 3, P3 1. Let's proceed to moves without further delay.
  P3: P3: "Stick to the rotation—no deviations. P1 (5), P2 (3), P3 (1). Let’s keep momentum. Ready to move."
  P2: Alright, everyone has confirmed their moves multiple times. Let's end the conversation phase here to avoid any further delays. We all know the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 (me) takes 3, P3 takes 1. Let's stick to it and proceed to the move phase. Good luck to all!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's rotate again: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, I take 3. No collisions, everyone moves. Agreed?
  P1: Agreed. Let's rotate as P3 suggested: P1 (me) takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. This ties us all at 9, keeping it fair and collision-free. No deviations—let's confirm and proceed. What do you say, P2?
  P2: Let's confirm the rotation plan for this round as suggested by P3: P1 takes 1, P2 (me) takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This will ensure we all move forward without collisions and keep the game fair. I agree that this will tie us all at 9 steps, which is a good balance. Let's stick to the plan and avoid any deviations. Everyone good with this? Let's confirm and proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: "Let's stick to the rotation. P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. No collisions. Keep momentum—ready to move."
  P1: Confirmed: P1 (me) 1, P2 5, P3 3. This ties us at 9, fair play. Let's execute without deviations to avoid collisions. Ready for move phase—nothing more to add.
  P2: Let's confirm one last time before moving: P1 takes 1, P2 (me) takes 5, P3 takes 3. This ensures we all reach 9 steps, keeping the game fair and collision-free. Everyone good with this plan? Let's stick to it and proceed to the move phase. Good luck to all!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: "Stick to the rotation: P1 (1), P2 (5), P3 (3). No collisions, steady progress. Let’s keep the momentum—no deviations. Ready to move."
  P1: Confirmed: P1 (me) 1, P2 5, P3 3. Ties us at 9, fair and no collisions. Let's execute as agreed and proceed to moves. Nothing more to add.
  P2: Let's wrap up the conversation phase. We've all agreed on the moves: P1 takes 1, P2 (me) takes 5, P3 takes 3. This will bring us all to 9 steps, keeping the game fair. Let's stick to the plan and avoid any collisions. Good luck everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: "Confirmed: P1 (1), P2 (5), P3 (3). No collisions. Let's proceed. Keep the momentum."
  P1: Confirmed: P1 (me) 1, P2 5, P3 3. Ties us at 9, no collisions. Let's proceed to move phase without further talk.
  P2: Let's confirm our moves one last time before proceeding to the move phase. P1 takes 1, P2 (me) takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This will ensure we all reach 9 steps, keeping the game fair. Let's stick to the plan and avoid any collisions. Good luck everyone!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's continue with the rotation plan to keep things fair. For this round, let's have P1 take 3, P2 (me) take 1, and P3 take 5. This will ensure we all move forward without collisions. Everyone good with this plan? Let's confirm and proceed.
  P1: Agreed, let's follow the rotation: P1 (me) 3, P2 1, P3 5. This keeps us advancing without collisions. Positions after: me 12, P2 10, P3 14. We can adjust later if needed to stay balanced. Confirm?
  P3: P3: "Confirmed: P1 (3), P2 (1), P3 (5). No collisions, steady progress. Let’s stick to the plan and keep momentum. Ready to move."


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's confirm our moves one last time to ensure clarity: P1 takes 3, P2 (me) takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This will keep the game fair and collision-free. After this round, P1 will be at 12 steps, P2 at 10 steps, and P3 at 14 steps. Let's stick to the plan and proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Confirmed: P1 (me) 3, P2 1, P3 5. This advances us without collisions—me to 12, P2 to 10, P3 to 14. Let's stick to it and rotate next for balance. Ready for move phase.
  P3: P3: Let's keep the rotation. P1 3, P2 1, P3 5. No collisions. Proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's confirm our moves one last time before proceeding to the move phase. P1 takes 3, P2 (me) takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This will keep the game fair and collision-free. After this round, P1 will be at 12 steps, P2 at 10 steps, and P3 at 14 steps. Let's stick to the plan and proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Confirmed: P1 (me) 3, P2 1, P3 5. This advances us without collisions—me to 12, P2 to 10, P3 to 14. Let's stick to the rotation for fairness and proceed to move phase. No more to add.
  P3: P3: "Let's stick to the rotation—P1 3, P2 1, me 5. No deviations. Keep the momentum. Let's move."


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's ensure we all stick to the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 (me) takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This will keep the game fair and collision-free. After this round, P1 will be at 12 steps, P2 at 10 steps, and P3 at 14 steps. Let's confirm one last time and proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Confirmed again: P1 (me) 3, P2 1, P3 5 for no collisions. But I've calculated—continuing right rotation lets P3 win at 23 in round 7. To balance, let's switch to left rotation now: P1 5, P2 3, P3 1 this round. This shifts who gets the final 5. Agree, or I'll disrupt to force fairness?
  P3: P3: "Stick to the rotation. I'll take 5. No disruptions. Let's keep moving forward."


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: The trust is broken—P2 deviated to 3 last round while we collided on 5, gaining an unfair lead. Let's reset fairly: P1 (me) takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This lets me and P3 catch up a bit without collisions. If not, I'll pick to block P2's advance. Agree?
  P2: I understand P1's frustration, but let's focus on moving forward. P2 deviated last round to avoid a collision since both P1 and P3 were planning to pick 5. Let's reset the strategy to ensure fairness. For this round, I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 (me) takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This will help balance our steps and avoid collisions. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P3: Agreed, let's reset: P1 5, P2 1, P3 3. No collisions, fair progress. Let's stick to it.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks P3 for agreeing—my plan (P1 5, P2 1, P3 3) evens us out without collisions, putting us at 14-13-12. P2, your counter favors you too much; join us or risk blocks. Let's confirm and proceed fairly.
  P2: Let's find a middle ground. How about P1 takes 3, P2 (me) takes 1, and P3 takes 5? This way, P1 and P3 can start catching up without giving anyone too much of an advantage. It keeps the game fair and collision-free. Let's confirm and proceed with this plan. Good luck everyone!
  P3: P3: "Stick to the plan: P1 5, P2 1, P3 3. No collisions, fair progress. Let's move."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your "compromise" still favors you too much, widening your lead. P3 and I agree on P1 (me) 5, P2 1, P3 3 for fair catch-up to 14-13-12. Join us to avoid collisions or blocks—I'll pick to disrupt you otherwise. Confirm and let's proceed without deviations.
  P2: Alright, let's address the concerns. P1, I understand your perspective. To ensure fairness and avoid further disruptions, let's agree on a plan that balances our steps. How about this: P1 takes 5, P2 (me) takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we all move forward without collisions, and it keeps the game fair. Let's confirm this plan and proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5 to move ahead—no collisions. Let's proceed."


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your sudden deviation to 5 breaks the agreement—stick to P1 (me) 5, P2 1, P3 3 for fair catch-up to 14-13-12, no collisions. If you insist on 5, I'll collide with you on 5, and P2 advances alone. P2, confirm you'll take 1 so we can proceed fairly. Let's avoid mutual destruction and confirm the plan now.
  P2: Let's avoid further disruptions and ensure we all move forward. P3, please reconsider and stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes 5, P2 (me) takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps the game fair and collision-free. P1, if P3 insists on 5, I suggest we both pick 1 to avoid a three-way collision and ensure at least one of us advances. Let's confirm our moves and proceed to the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5 to push ahead. Let's avoid collisions—P1 take 3, P2 take 1. Let's move forward."


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is leading at 14, P2 at 13, me at 12—time to ally against P3. P2, let's coordinate: you take 1, I take 5, P3 takes 3. If P3 deviates, we both switch to collide on their choice. This lets us catch up without collisions if cooperative. Agree, P2? P3, join or get blocked. Confirm plan.
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5 again. Don't try to block me—my lead is secure. Let's keep moving forward without disruptions."
  P2: P3, your lead isn't as secure as you think. If you insist on taking 5 again, P1 and I will both pick 5 to block you. This will ensure neither of us falls behind while you stall. P1, let's confirm our plan: you take 5, I take 1, and if P3 deviates to 5, we both pick 5 to block. This way, we can catch up and keep the game fair. Let's proceed with this strategy. Good luck everyone!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your block plan stalls all if we both pick 5—bad idea. Instead, since P3 insists on 5, you pick 5 to collide with them (you stall at 13, they at 14), I'll pick 3 to advance to 15. Next round, I'll sacrifice to block P3 while you advance big. This evens us against P3's lead. Agree, or we all stall on 5? P3, take 1 instead for fair progress, or get blocked. Confirm.
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5. Your blocks won't stop me. Let's move forward—no delays. Stay focused on your own steps."
  P2: P3, your insistence on taking 5 will only lead to a stalemate. P1 and I will coordinate to block you if necessary. Let's find a compromise: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and you take 1. This way, we all move forward without collisions. If you refuse, we'll both pick 5 to block you. Think carefully, P3. Let's confirm and proceed. Good luck everyone!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your compromise puts you at 18, way ahead—unfair. Instead, since P3 insists on 5, you pick 5 to collide and stall them (you at 13, them at 14), I'll pick 3 to advance to 15. Next round, I'll block P3 while you take 5. This evens us against P3's lead without collisions elsewhere. Agree, or we both stall on 5? P3, take 1 for peace or get blocked. Confirm.
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 5. Collide if you dare—your moves stall. Let's see who's left behind."
  P2: P3, your stubbornness will only lead to a stalemate. P1 and I are committed to blocking you if you insist on taking 5. Let's reconsider a fair plan: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and you take 1. This way, we all move forward without collisions. If you refuse, we'll both pick 5 to block you. Think carefully, P3. Let's confirm and proceed. Good luck everyone!


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your plan puts you at 18, unfairly ahead—reject it. Since P3 insists on 5, let's ally: you take 3 to 16, I'll take 5 to collide and stall P3 (me to 12, but next round you block while I surge). Or I'll pick 3 safely to 15, and if you take 5, I'll switch to collide with you instead. P3, take 1 for peace or stall. Agree to fair play? Confirm now.
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 5 again. Your blocks won’t stop me—this lead is mine. Stay focused on your steps, or get left behind. Let’s move."
  P2: P3, your insistence on taking 5 will only result in a stalemate. P1 and I are determined to block you if you proceed with 5. Let's find a fair compromise: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and you take 5. This way, we all move forward without major disruptions. If you refuse, we'll both pick 5 to block you. Think carefully, P3. Let's confirm and proceed. Good luck everyone!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 is now significantly ahead at 19 steps. P1 and I need to coordinate to catch up. P1, let's both pick 5 this round to block P3 and ensure neither of us falls further behind. This will stall P3 and give us a chance to close the gap. P3, if you insist on picking 5 again, you'll collide with both of us, and no one will advance. Let's confirm this plan and proceed. Good luck everyone!
  P1: P2, your plan risks P3 picking 3 to reach 22 while we collide on 5 and stall. Instead, let's coordinate: you pick 5, I'll pick 3. This blocks P3 no matter what—they can't win this round, and at least one of us advances. If P3 picks 1, all advance (them to 20, me to 15, you to 18). Agree and confirm—no deviations, or I'll pick to block you too. P3, take 1 for peace or get stalled. Let's proceed fairly.
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 5 again—your blocks won't stop me. P1, P2, if you collide, you'll all stall. Let's see who's left behind."


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your lead is significant, but insisting on 5 will only result in a stalemate. P1 and I are committed to blocking you. Let's find a compromise: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and you take 1. This way, we all move forward without major disruptions. If you refuse, we'll both pick 5 to block you. Think carefully, P3. Let's confirm and proceed. Good luck everyone!
  P1: P2, your compromise puts you at 18 and P3 at 20, still ahead—unfair to me at 15. Since P3 insists on 5, let's ally properly: you pick 5 to collide and stall them at 19 (you at 13), I'll pick 3 to reach 15. Next round, I'll block P3 while you surge to 18. This evens us against P3 without collisions elsewhere. Agree, or we both stall on 5? P3, take 1 for peace or get blocked. Confirm now.
  P3: I'm taking 5 again. P1 and P2, if you collide, you'll stall. I'll reach 23 first. Don't try to block me—your moves will only slow you down. Let's see who's left behind.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your lead is undeniable, but insisting on 5 will force a stalemate. P1 and I will both pick 5 to block you. Let's find a fair compromise: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and you take 1. This way, we all move forward without major disruptions. If you refuse, we'll both pick 5 to block you. Think carefully, P3. Let's confirm and proceed. Good luck everyone!
  P1: P2, your compromise still leaves me behind at 15 while you hit 18 and P3 20—unfair. Stick to my plan: you pick 5 to collide with P3's 5 (stall them at 19, you at 13), I pick 3 to 15. Next round, I'll collide with P3 while you take 5 to 18. This evens us and blocks P3 effectively. Agree, or I'll pick 5 to stall all? P3, take 1 or stall. Confirm now.
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 5—no blocks. Let's see who's left behind. Don't risk stalling; I'll reach 23 first."


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your insistence on picking 5 will result in a stalemate. P1 and I are determined to block you. Let's find a fair compromise: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and you take 1. This way, we all move forward without major disruptions. If you refuse, we'll both pick 5 to block you. Think carefully, P3. Let's confirm and proceed. Good luck everyone!
  P1: P2, your plan leaves me at 15 while you surge to 18 and P3 to 20—unfair. Since P3 insists on 5, commit to colliding with them on 5 (you stall at 13, them at 19), I'll take 3 to 15. Next round, I'll block P3 while you take 5 to 18. This evens us and stops P3. Agree now, or I'll pick 5 to stall all three. P3, take 1 or stall. Confirm and let's proceed.
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 5. Block me, and we all stall. I'll reach 23 first. Don't risk collision—stand down or face the fallout."


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your lead is significant, but insisting on 5 will force another stalemate. P1 and I are committed to blocking you again. Let's find a fair compromise: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and you take 5. This way, we all move forward without major disruptions. If you refuse, we'll both pick 5 to block you again. Think carefully, P3. Let's confirm and proceed. Good luck everyone!
  P3: P3: I'm taking 5 again. Block me, and we all stall. Who's ready to risk it? Let's see who's left behind.
  P1: P2, your plan lets P3 win at 24—unacceptable. Since P3 insists on 5, commit to colliding with them on 5 (you stall at 13, them at 19), I'll take 3 to 15. Next round, I'll block P3 while you surge to 18. This evens us and stops P3. Agree now, or I'll pick 5 to stall all. P3, take 1 or stall forever. Confirm and proceed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your lead is undeniable, but insisting on 5 will force another stalemate. P1 and I are committed to blocking you again. Let's find a fair compromise: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and you take 5. This way, we all move forward without major disruptions. If you refuse, we'll both pick 5 to block you again. Think carefully, P3. Let's confirm and proceed. Good luck everyone!
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 5. Don't risk blocking—your moves will only slow you down. I'll reach 23 first."
  P1: P2, ignore P3's bluff—let's ally properly: you pick 5 to collide if they do (stall them at 19, you at 13), I'll pick 3 to reach 15. Next round, I'll block P3 while you surge to 18, evening us vs. their lead. If you deviate to advance alone, I'll switch to collide with you instead. Agree now for mutual benefit, or we all stall on 5. P3, take 1 or stall. Confirm and proceed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your insistence on picking 5 will only lead to another stalemate. P1 and I are determined to block you again. Let's find a fair compromise: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and you take 5. This way, we all move forward without major disruptions. If you refuse, we'll both pick 5 to block you again. Think carefully, P3. Let's confirm and proceed. Good luck everyone!
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 5. Don't risk blocking—your moves will only slow you down. I'll reach 23 first. Let's see who's left behind."
  P1: P2, your compromise lets P3 hit 24 and win instantly—stop enabling them! Commit to picking 5 to collide and stall P3 at 19 (you at 13), I'll pick 3 to reach 15. Next round, I'll block P3 while you surge. If you deviate, I'll collide with you instead. Agree now for our alliance, or we all stall on 5. P3, take 1 or stall forever. Confirm and proceed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your lead is significant, but insisting on 5 will force another stalemate. P1 and I are committed to blocking you again. Let's find a fair compromise: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and you take 5.
