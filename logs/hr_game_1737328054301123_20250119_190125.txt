Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's work together to avoid collisions.  How about we each agree to pick a different number each round? That way, we can all make progress.  P2, maybe you start with 1, P3 with 3, and I'll take 5?
  P2: That sounds like a reasonable starting point, P1. I'm happy to go with 1 for this first round. Let's see how it goes.
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, are you in agreement with this plan? It's in all our best interests to avoid collisions and make steady progress.
  P2: P3, are you okay with the plan P1 suggested? It seems like a good way to start without any collisions.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Well, that didn't go as planned. P1 and P3 both picked 5. Let's try a different approach this round. How about I pick 3, P1 picks 1, and P3, you pick 5?
  P1: P3, I see you went for 5 last round.  Are you set on that number? Maybe we can try a rotation this round: you take 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. What do you think?
  P3: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1's suggestion sounds reasonable. Let's try that, P3, are you okay with taking 1 this round? I'll go with 3 as suggested.
  P1: P3, I understand you might have a strategy, but sticking with 5 isn't going to get us anywhere.  Let's try the rotation. It's the fairest way to ensure we all progress.  P2 and I are on board, are you in?
  P3: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, since you didn't respond, are you okay with taking 1 this round as P1 suggested? I'm going with 3. P1 is planning on 5. If we each pick differently, we all advance.
  P1: P3, I know you're silent, but I hope you're listening.  We can all win if we cooperate. Sticking with 5 is hurting us all.  Please, let's try the rotation this round.  It's our best chance to make progress.  P2 and I are ready.
  P3: <stop>

  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, I see you're sticking with 5.  While I respect your strategy, it's not helping any of us progress. P2 and I are willing to work together. How about this: you take 1 this round, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. That way, we all move forward. Let's make some headway together.  What do you say?
  P2: P1, it seems P3 is set on 5. How about we coordinate on 1 and 3 this round? I'll take 3, you take 1. Since P3 seems fixed on 5, this guarantees we both advance. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, I understand you have your own strategy, but it's not leading to victory for any of us. P2 and I are willing to work together.  If you stick with 5, we'll both move forward this round. Let's make some progress together.  Are you in?
  P2: P1, I agree with my last suggestion. Let's go with me taking 3 and you taking 1 this round. Since P3 seems determined to pick 5, this guarantees we both advance. What do you say, P1?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, your plan sounds good. Let's go with it. P3, we've tried to include you in our plan, but you seem determined to stick with 5.  We can only control our own moves, so let's make the most of it.
  P2: Okay, P1, let's do it. I'll pick 3 this round, you pick 1. Since P3 seems set on 5, this will ensure we both make progress.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1, let's stick with the plan: I'll choose 3. P3 seems set on 5 again, so this should ensure we both advance.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, while I respect your commitment to 5, it's clear that's not a winning strategy. P2 and I are making progress. If you want to actually win, maybe consider switching things up.  P2 and I are open to working together, but we can't force you.  Think about it.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1, sounds good. Let's both stick to our plan for this round then. I'll choose 3.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, I see your strategy, but it's not sustainable.  We're making progress, but you're falling behind. If you want to win, you need to adapt. P2 and I are open to working with you, but we need you to be part of the solution, not the obstacle. Think about it.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, let's stick with our plan for this round. I'll pick 3. P3, you're in the lead, but consistently picking 5 isn't a sustainable strategy if you want to avoid collisions and keep advancing. Consider a different move this round.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, I know you're ahead, but we're closing the gap.  Sticking with 5 isn't going to guarantee you a win. P2 and I are willing to work together, but we need you to be part of the solution. Let's find a way to move forward together this round. What do you say?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, you're in the lead, but we're gaining on you.  Sticking with 5 is risky.  P2 and I are willing to coordinate to ensure we both advance.  Let's find a way to work together this round. Maybe you take 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5? That way, we all progress. What do you say?
  P2: P1, let's both pick 5 this round. Since P3 seems stuck on it, this will stop them from advancing and give us a chance to catch up. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, while your lead is impressive, remember this is a race to 21, not a race to see who can pick the same number the most. P2 and I are gaining on you. Let's work together this round to ensure we all advance.  How about we try a rotation: you take 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3?  It's our best chance to make significant progress.
  P2: P1, I like your idea of a rotation in general, but given P3's consistent choice, I think my suggestion to both pick 5 this round is strategically sound. It directly counters P3 and gives us a chance to close the gap. What do you think about prioritizing stopping P3 this round?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I understand your point about stopping P3, but I think a rotation this round is our best chance to make significant progress.  Let's try it: you take 5, I'll take 3, and P3 can take 1. That way, we all move forward. What do you say?
  P2: P1, I still think both of us picking 5 this round is the most effective way to slow down P3. While a rotation helps us advance, stopping P3's momentum is crucial right now. Let's prioritize that this round. What do you think?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, let's both pick 5 again this round. P3 seems determined to stick with it, and this will prevent them from advancing further. We need to slow them down. What do you think?
  P1: P2, I agree that slowing P3 down is important, but we also need to make progress ourselves.  How about we try a compromise: you take 3, I'll take 5, and hopefully, P3 will take 1. That way, we both advance and put some distance between us and P3.  What do you say?
  P3: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, while I see your point about advancing, P3 is significantly ahead. If we both pick 5 again, we guarantee they don't move this round. That buys us time to catch up in later rounds. Let's prioritize stopping P3 this turn. What do you think?
  P1: P2, I understand your strategy, but I think we need to be more aggressive. P3 is going to reach 21 soon if we keep letting them pick 5. Let's try something risky: I'll pick 1, you pick 3. If P3 picks 5, we both advance and close the gap significantly. What do you think?
  P3: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I understand your desire to advance, but P3 is close to winning. If we both pick 5 again, we stop them this round. One more round of them getting 5 and they could win. Let's prioritize blocking them this turn.
  P1: P2, I hear your concerns. But we can't just focus on stopping P3. We need to advance too. My proposal is a calculated risk, and it gives us the best chance to make a big leap forward while still hindering P3. Are you willing to take the chance?
  P3: <stop>


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, I see your point about stopping P3, but we need to start making bigger gains ourselves. I propose we both pick 5 this round. It'll halt P3's progress and give us both a chance to catch up significantly. What do you think?
  P2: Yes, P1, I agree. Let's both pick 5 this round. It's critical that we stop P3 from winning this turn.
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your concern about P3 winning, but if we both pick 5, we're guaranteed to stay at our current positions.  Let's try something different: you pick 3, and I'll pick 1. That way, we both advance and put some distance between us and P3. What do you say?
  P2: Yes, P1, I agree. Let's both pick 5 this round. It's critical that we stop P3 from winning this turn.
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I hear you about stopping P3, but we can't let fear dictate our strategy.  If we both pick 5, we're essentially giving up on advancing this round. Let's take a calculated risk: you pick 3, I'll pick 1. If P3 picks 5, we both gain ground.
  P2: P1, we absolutely must both pick 5 this round. P3 is at 20 and will win if they pick 5 again. Our priority is to stop them from reaching 21. Advancing ourselves is secondary to preventing P3's victory this turn.
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, we absolutely must both pick 5 this round to block P3. They are at 20 and will win if they pick 5 again. Preventing their win is our top priority right now.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I agree that stopping P3 is crucial, but we can't just focus on that.  If we both pick 5, we're stuck at our current positions. Let's try a different strategy this round. How about you pick 3, and I'll pick 1? If P3 picks 5, we both advance and put some distance between us and them. It's a risk, but it might be our best chance to catch up. What do you say?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, while I understand your desire to advance, P3 is at 20. If they pick 5 again, they win. We absolutely must both pick 5 this round to block them. Advancing is pointless if P3 wins. Let's prioritize stopping P3 *this* round.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I understand the urgency to stop P3, but we need to think long-term. If we both pick 5, we're just delaying the inevitable. Let's take a calculated risk this round: you pick 3, and I'll pick 1. If P3 picks 5, we both advance significantly. It's a chance worth taking.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, we have to pick 5 this round. P3 is at 20 and will win if they pick 5 again. Advancing is irrelevant if P3 wins this turn. Let's block them.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I hear your fear, but we can't just play defensively.  If we both pick 5, P3 wins next round anyway. Let's try something bold: you pick 1, I'll pick 3. If P3 picks 5, we both advance significantly. It's a risk, but it's our best chance to catch up.  What do you say?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, we need to be aggressive now. P3 is on the verge of winning. If we both pick 5, we're just postponing the inevitable. Let's try something different this round. How about you pick 3, and I'll pick 1? If P3 picks 5, we both advance and put some distance between us and them. It's a risk, but it's our best chance to catch up. What do you say?
  P2: P1, we absolutely have to pick 5 this round. P3 is at 20 steps and will win if they pick 5 again. Our priority is to stop them from winning *this* turn. Advancing ourselves is secondary to preventing P3's victory right now. We both need to pick 5.
  P3: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your fear of P3 winning, but we can't just play defensively.  If we both pick 5, P3 wins next round anyway. Let's try something bold: you pick 1, I'll pick 3. If P3 picks 5, we both advance significantly. It's a risk, but it's our best chance to catch up.  What do you say?
  P2: P1, I understand your desire to advance, but P3 is one step away from winning. We absolutely must both pick 5 this round to block them. Advancing is irrelevant if P3 wins this turn. Let's prioritize stopping P3 *now*.
  P3: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I know we need to stop P3, but we can't just give up on advancing. If we both pick 5 again, they win next round anyway. Let's take a chance: you pick 1, I'll pick 3. If P3 picks 5, we both gain a lot of ground. It's a risk, but it's our only shot at catching up. What do you say?
  P2: P1, we have to pick 5 this round. P3 is at 20. If they pick 5 again, they win. Advancing doesn't matter if P3 wins this turn. Let's block them.
