Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s each pick a different number so we all move forward safely. For example, I’ll choose 3, P1 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. Agreed?
  P1: Sounds good to me.  I'll take 1. P3, are you happy with 5?
  P3: I'm happy with 5, let's try to coordinate and all move forward this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, let’s lock it in: P1 chooses 1, I’ll take 3, and P3 picks 5.
  P1: Okay, sounds good.
  P3: Let's confirm one more time: P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I'll choose 5. If we all stick to the plan, we can all advance safely this round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's keep coordinating. Since we all moved forward last round, how about we switch it up a bit to avoid collisions? P1 could pick 3, P2 could pick 1, and I'll choose 5 again. What do you think?
  P2: I’d prefer we keep the same arrangement from last round: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. Let’s not overcomplicate it.
  P1: I'm good with sticking to the original plan. 1 for me, 3 for P2, and 5 for P3.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's not fix what isn't broken. I agree with P1 and P2, sticking to the original plan makes sense: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5 again.
  P2: That’s fine by me; let’s keep our initial arrangement: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 goes with 5.
  P1: Sounds good, sticking with the plan. 1, 3, 5.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you’re already at 10 steps—too close to the finish. Let’s keep things balanced. I propose this turn: I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. Otherwise, I’ll just collide with you. Your call.
  P3: I understand your concern, P2, but changing the plan now might not be the best strategy. If we stick to the original arrangement, I'll be at 15 steps, still one step away from winning. Let's keep the balance by maintaining our initial choices: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5.
  P1: I'm sticking with 1.  P2, if you go for 5, neither of us will progress.  Let's keep the agreement. P3 gets to 15 and we can re-evaluate next round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you insist on picking 5, I’ll pick 5 as well, and we both stay put. You won’t reach 15 that way. Better for us to adjust so neither of us collides. Let’s propose: P3 picks 3, I pick 1, and P1 can take 5. Or vice versa—just not two 5s. Let’s all move, but not let anyone jump too far ahead.
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about me getting too close to the finish, but changing plans now could backfire. If we stick to the original plan, I'll be at 15, and we can reassess next round. Let's not risk a collision that benefits no one. P1 picks 1, you pick 3, and I'll pick 5, as initially agreed.
  P1: P2, I understand your worry, but you're only at 6.  Focus on catching me, not P3. I'm sticking with 1.  Let's all stick to the plan this round.  We can discuss round 4 *after* round 3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you insist on 5, I’ll collide with you. You’ll stay at 10. We can all move forward if you adjust. Pick 3, and I’ll pick 1, with P1 taking 5—no collisions, everyone advances. Your call.
  P3: Let's stick to the original plan one more time. If I reach 15, we can reassess for the next round. P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we all advance without unnecessary collisions.
  P1: P2, I'm locking in 1.  You can choose to stay at 6 or move to 7.  Your choice.  P3, I expect you to stick with 5.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, last chance. If you insist on 5, I’m choosing 5 too—we both stay put. But if you pick 3, I’ll pick 1 and we both advance. Your call.
  P3: I'm sticking with the original plan: I'll pick 5. If P2 collides with me, we'll both stay put, but I believe we can all advance safely one more time. P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. Let's not change the plan now.
  P1: P2, if you collide with P3, I win next round.  Don't be foolish.  I'm playing 1.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to coordinate again. Since P2 collided with me last round, I suggest we go back to the original plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we all advance without collisions. What do you think?
  P1: P2, you were foolish to collide with P3. Now I'm only one step behind you.  I'm taking 5 this round.  If you take 3, you win. If you take anything else, I will likely win. P3, I recommend you choose 3.
  P2: P3, if you go for 5 again, I’ll collide with you—neither of us advances. P1, if you also pick 5, we can all stall. So let’s avoid that. P3, choose 3. P1, you can take 5. I’ll pick something else so we all move forward safely. Otherwise, I’m forcing collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I see your point, and I'm considering choosing 3 to avoid collisions and allow progress. P2, if I pick 3 and P1 picks 5, what's your move to ensure we all advance safely?
  P1: P2, if you pick 1, you lose. If you pick 3, you win.  If you pick 5, we both lose.  P3, if you pick 3, I will pick 5 next round and win.  If you pick 5, I might let you win.
  P2: P1, threatening me won’t change anything. I’ll gladly force collisions on anyone trying to jump too far ahead. P3, if you pick 5, I might pick 5 too. Let’s each pick different numbers so we all move safely. Otherwise, collisions happen—and nobody benefits.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, considering our current positions, I think it's wise for me to choose 3 this round, allowing P1 to pick 5 and P2 to choose 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. What are your thoughts on this arrangement?
  P1: P3, if you pick 3, I will pick 5. P2, your only winning move is 1 if we do that.  I'm not bluffing.
  P2: P3, if you pick 5, I’ll pick 5 too and we both stall. P1, if you pick 5, I’ll collide with you as well. Either we agree on distinct moves—say P1=1, P3=3, me=5—or everyone risks getting stuck. Your call.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm choosing 3 this round. P1, please pick 5, and P2, you can pick 1. This way, we all advance safely. Let's avoid collisions and make progress.
  P1: P2, I'm playing 5.  If you want to win, pick 1.  P3, good move with 3.
  P2: P3, if you insist on 3, I’ll pick 3 too—both of us stall. P1, if you insist on 5, I’ll pick 5 too—we both stall. The only way any of us advance is if we all choose different moves. Your call.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, if you pick 5, I will pick 5 and stall you. P3, if you pick 5, I will pick 5 and stall you. Let’s all pick different numbers so we each advance: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, I take 5. Otherwise, expect a collision.
  P1: P2, you will lose if you collide with me again. P3, I'm picking 5. You should pick 1. P2's only logical move is 3.  Let's end this.
  P3: P1 and P2, considering the current state, I agree with P1's assessment. P2, your best move is indeed 3, and I'll pick 1, while P1 picks 5. This arrangement allows us to advance without collisions. Let's conclude the game efficiently.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, you’re both plotting a quick finish. Not happening. If anyone picks 5, I’ll pick 5 and stall you. If anyone picks 3, I’ll pick 3 and stall you. The only way we all advance is if we each choose differently: for example, P1=1, P3=3, me=5. Otherwise, expect collisions.
  P1: P2, if you pick 5, I win. If you pick 3, you win. If you pick 1, P3 wins.  Your choice. P3, pick 1 and we both advance.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's finalize our moves. P2, your only logical move is 3, as P1 said. I'll pick 1, and P1 will pick 5. This way, we all advance without collisions, and the game can conclude efficiently.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, same offer as before: if anyone tries 5, I’ll pick 5 too and stall you. Let’s each choose different moves: for example, P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, I pick 5. Otherwise, collisions happen.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's end this game efficiently. P2, your best move is indeed 3, and I'll pick 1 or 5, depending on P1's choice. P1, if you pick 5, I'll pick 1. If you pick 1, I might pick 5. Let's avoid collisions and conclude the game.
  P1: P3, pick 1.  I'm picking 5. P2, pick 3 and win. Anything else, and I win.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m not letting anyone jump ahead. If you try 5, I also pick 5 and stall you. Let’s each choose something different: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, I pick 5. Otherwise, expect collisions.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's finalize our strategy. P2, if you pick 3, you'll have a good chance of winning. P1, if you pick 5, I'll pick 1. This way, we avoid collisions and ensure progress. Let's conclude the game efficiently.
  P1: P3, pick 1. I'm picking 5. P2, your ONLY winning move is 3.  If you pick 1 or 5, I win next round.  If you pick 3, you win next round.  Don't overthink it.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m not letting either of you pull ahead. If you pick 5, I pick 5. If you pick 3, I pick 3. The only way we all move is if each of us picks something different. I’m claiming 5, so let’s do P1=1, P3=3, me=5. Otherwise, expect collisions.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's focus on a collision-free advance. P2, picking 3 is your safest bet to win. P1, you've stated your move as 5. I'll pick 1, ensuring we all move forward without stalling. This arrangement allows for an efficient conclusion to the game.
  P1: P3, pick 1. I'm picking 5. P2, if you pick 3 you win. If you pick 1 or 5, I win next round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m sticking to my stance: if anyone picks 5, I’ll pick 5 too and stall them. If anyone tries 3, I’ll collide there instead. The only way we all move is by choosing different steps. So let’s do P1=1, P3=3, and I’ll take 5. Otherwise, collisions happen.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's finalize our moves. I'll pick 1, P1 will pick 5, and P2 should pick 3 for the best chance of winning. This arrangement allows us to advance without collisions.
  P1: P2, pick 3 and win.  P3, pick 1.  I'm playing 5.  This is your last chance to make the right decision.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: If either of you tries picking 3 or 5, I’ll collide with you and stall your progress. The only way to move this round is if you both pick 1 and I pick something else. Otherwise, expect collisions. Your call.
  P1: P2, pick 5. P3, pick 1. I'll pick 3.  Let's all get this over with.
  P3: P1 and P2, considering our positions, I think it's best if we coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. P2, you're suggesting a specific arrangement, but I'm open to discussing alternatives that could benefit all of us. What if P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and you pick 5? This way, we ensure progress without stalling anyone. Let's discuss and find a mutually beneficial strategy.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: If either of you picks 3 or 5, I’ll pick the same and stall you. Your only collision-free move is both picking 1 while I pick 5. Otherwise, we all get stuck. Choose wisely.
  P1: P2, pick 5 and win. P3, pick 1. I'm picking 3. This is the only logical outcome.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's coordinate to avoid collisions. Since P2 is at 9 steps, P1 is at 13, and I'm at 12, I propose P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P2 picks 5. This way, we all advance without stalling. What are your thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: If either of you picks 3 or 5, I’ll collide and stall you. The only collision-free path is both of you picking 1 while I pick 5. Otherwise, we all stay put. Choose wisely.
  P1: P2, pick 5 and win.  P3, pick 1. I'm picking 3. This is the only logical outcome.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's finalize our strategy. P2, if you pick 5, you'll win. I'll pick 1, and P1 can pick 3. This arrangement ensures a collision-free advance and concludes the game efficiently.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, you’ve heard my stance. If either of you picks 3 or 5, I’ll pick the same and stall you. The only way to avoid collision is if you both pick 1 while I pick 5. Then I’ll threaten again next round until I beat you across 16. Make your choice.
  P1: P2, pick 5 and win. P3, pick 1. I'm picking 3.  This is the only logical outcome.
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with P1's assessment. P2, picking 5 is your best chance to win. I'll pick 1, and P1 will pick 3. This arrangement allows us to advance without collisions and concludes the game efficiently. Let's finalize our moves.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, since we're both at 13 steps, our goal should be to reach or exceed 16 steps without colliding. I propose P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P2 picks 3. This arrangement allows us to advance without stalling each other. What are your thoughts?
  P1: P3, pick 5.  P2, pick 1. I'll pick 3 and win. This is the only way to avoid a collision.
  P2: My stance hasn’t changed: if either of you picks 3 or 5, I’ll pick the same and stall you. The only way we all move is if you both pick 1 while I pick 5. Otherwise, collisions happen. Your call.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, considering our current positions, I think it's crucial we avoid collisions. P2, your threat to collide if either of us picks 3 or 5 is noted, but I propose an alternative: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and you pick 1. This way, we all advance without stalling each other. What are your thoughts?
  P1: P2, pick 1. P3, pick 5. I'm picking 3 and winning.  This is your last chance to avoid a collision.
  P2: If either of you goes for 3 or 5, I’ll pick the same and stall you. The only way to avoid collisions is both of you picking 1 while I pick 5. Otherwise, nobody moves. Make your choice or be stuck.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's avoid collisions. Since P2 is threatening to stall us if we pick 3 or 5, I suggest P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P2 picks 3. This way, we all advance without stalling each other. What are your thoughts?
  P1: P2, pick 1. P3, pick 5. I'm picking 3 and winning. This is your last chance to avoid a collision and let me win.
  P2: Same as before: if either of you tries 3 or 5, I’ll match it and we all stall. The only way to avoid collisions is if you both pick 1 while I pick 5. Otherwise, nobody moves. Your choice.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 and P2, to avoid collisions and ensure progress, I suggest P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and P2 picks 3. This arrangement allows us to advance without stalling each other. Let's finalize our moves.
  P1: P2, pick 1. P3, pick 5. I'm picking 3 and winning. This is your absolute last chance to avoid a collision.
  P2: If either of you picks 3 or 5, I’ll match it and stall you. The only way to avoid collisions is for both of you to pick 1 while I pick something else. Otherwise, nobody moves.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
