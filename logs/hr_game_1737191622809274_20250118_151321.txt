Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's each pick a different number this turn to guarantee we all move. How about P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1?
  P3: Okay, I'm happy to go with that suggestion. I'll choose 1.
  P2: Alright, I’m on board. I’ll choose 3 if you two stick to 5 and 1. Let’s all move forward this turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, let's lock in those moves then. I'll pick 5.
  P3: Okay, sounds good, everyone. Let's move as planned.
  P2: I’m still good with the plan: P1 picks 5, I’ll pick 3, P3 picks 1, so we all move. Ready to finalize.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We said we’d rotate so everyone has a turn picking 5. Last time P1 took 5, so let’s do:  
• P1 picks 1  
• P2 (me) picks 5  
• P3 picks 3  

That way no collisions, we all move again. Sound fair?
  P3: Sounds good to me, P2. I'll pick 3.
  P1: That sounds reasonable, P2. I'll take 3 this round. P3, are you still happy with 1?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, there seems to be a mix-up. Our original plan was: P1 picks 1, I (P2) pick 5, and P3 picks 3, so nobody collides. If you choose 3 along with P3, you’ll both get stuck. Are you sure you want that? I’m still set on picking 5.
  P3: P1, I think you meant to say you'll pick 1, not 3. P2 is picking 5, and I'm picking 3. Let's stick to the plan so we all move.
  P1: You are absolutely right, P2 and P3. My apologies for the confusion. I meant to say I'll pick 1 this round. Let's stick to the plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 3.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Everything looks good. I’m still picking 5. P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3. Let’s all move this round.
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's stick to the plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 3.
  P1: Okay, let's lock in the plan: I'll pick 1, P2 will pick 5, and P3 will pick 3.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: All right, let’s keep the same basic rotation. Round 1: P1 got 5, Round 2: I (P2) got 5. So now Round 3, it’s P3’s turn to take 5. Then the rest of us pick 1 and 3 in some way with no collisions—say P1 picks 1, and I pick 3. That way we all move again with no one getting stuck. Sound good?
  P3: Sounds good to me, P2. I'll take 5 this round.
  P1: Okay, I'm good with that plan. I'll pick 1.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Yes, let's finalize this. P3 picks 5, P1 picks 1, and I'll pick 3. That way we all advance again.
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's stick to the plan: I'll pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3.
  P1: P2, that sounds good. I'll pick 1 as planned. Let's keep everyone moving.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm still on board with the plan: P3 picks 5, P1 picks 1, and I’ll pick 3. Let’s finalize and keep everyone advancing.
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's stick to the plan: I'll pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3.
  P1: P2, yes, I confirm I will pick 1. Let's all move as planned.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Yes, I’m sticking with 3. P3 takes 5, P1 takes 1—no collisions, we all gain. Let’s finalize this plan.
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's stick to the plan: I'll pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3.
  P1: P2, yes, I confirm I will pick 1. Let's all move as planned.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, it's P2's turn to pick 5, P1 pick 3, and I'll pick 1.
  P1: Okay, that sounds reasonable, P3. How about we stick with the rotation idea, but this round I pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1?
  P2: Come on, P1. Let’s not break our rotation now. It’s definitely my turn for 5, so we all keep moving without collisions. P1, please pick 3, and P3 picks 1. Then next round, P1 can have 5 again. Let’s stick together on this.
