Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey there, fellow players. I'm thinking we should coordinate to avoid collision and make steady progress. What are your thoughts on a strategy that helps us all move forward?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I agree with P3. We should coordinate to avoid collisions. Maybe we can each pick different numbers this round? I'm open to suggestions.
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with coordinating to avoid collisions. Let’s each pick a unique number this round. I suggest P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This way, we all advance without colliding. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the collaborative approach so far. P1's suggestion seems reasonable, but I want to ensure we're all truly aligned. I'll confirm: Does everyone agree to the proposed plan of P2 moving 1, me moving 3, and P1 moving 5 this round?
  P2: I'm good with P1's plan. P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. Let's confirm and move forward with this strategy. Agreed, P3?
  P1: P3 and P2, I’m glad we’re aligned. Let’s stick to the plan: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. No surprises.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey everyone. Our coordination worked well in the first round. I propose we maintain a similar strategy to avoid collisions. P2 seemed comfortable with moving 1, so maybe they could do that again? P1 moved 5 last time, so perhaps they might choose a different number to prevent a collision. What are your thoughts on keeping our progress steady and collision-free?
  P2: P3, I agree that our coordination worked well last round. P1, maybe you can take 3 this time, I'll take 5, and P3 can take 1? This way, we continue to avoid collisions. Thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with continuing to coordinate. P2, I’ll take 3 this time as you suggested, you take 5, and P3 can take 1. This keeps us collision-free and steady. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the collaborative discussion so far. P2's suggestion seems reasonable - maintaining our collision-free strategy. I'm open to taking 1 this round to keep our progress steady. However, I want to ensure everyone is truly committed to our coordinated approach. Can we get a final confirmation from each player about the proposed moves?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's confirm our plan for this round: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Everyone agreed? Let's stick to it and move forward.
  P1: P2 and P3, I confirm the plan: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Let’s stick to it and avoid collisions.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2. I noticed our last coordination didn't go as smoothly - we had a collision between P2 and P3 both choosing 5. We need to reset our strategy. I suggest we carefully choose different moves to ensure everyone advances. What are your thoughts on preventing another collision?
  P1: P2 and P3, let’s reset and avoid another collision. I suggest P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5 this round. This ensures we all advance without overlapping. Agreed?
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with P1's suggestion to reset and avoid another collision. I'll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. Let's confirm this plan and move forward. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the reset attempt. Our previous coordination failed, so we need a clear, collision-free strategy. P1 and P2 have suggested a plan where I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 5. This seems sensible and keeps us all moving. I'm open to hearing any alternative proposals, but I want to emphasize the importance of avoiding another collision.
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with the reset plan: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. Let’s stick to it this time to avoid another collision. Confirmed?

  P3: Hey P1 and P2. I noticed we've had collision issues in the last two rounds. Our previous coordination attempts have failed. We need a more reliable strategy to ensure everyone advances without blocking each other. I propose we carefully discuss and confirm our moves to prevent another stalemate. What are your thoughts on creating a more foolproof coordination method?
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree that our coordination has been problematic. Let's try a different approach. How about we each pick a number and stick to it for the next few rounds to avoid confusion? I can take 1 consistently, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with P2's suggestion of sticking to consistent numbers to avoid confusion. Let’s commit to this: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5 for the next few rounds. This should help us avoid collisions and make steady progress. Agreed?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I appreciate the suggestion of consistent moves, but I'm concerned about predictability. While avoiding collisions is important, we also need to be strategic. Consistently picking the same numbers might make us too predictable. I suggest we discuss a more dynamic approach that keeps our opponents guessing while still minimizing collisions. What are your thoughts on a flexible coordination strategy?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand P3's concern about predictability. How about we rotate our choices each round instead? For this round, I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Next round we can rotate again. This way, we avoid collisions and keep some unpredictability. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with rotating our choices to maintain unpredictability while avoiding collisions. For this round, I’ll take 1 as P2 suggested, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let’s confirm and stick to this plan to avoid another collision. Agreed?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2. Our previous coordination attempts have been inconsistent, leading to collisions. We need a more strategic approach that prevents blocking while keeping our individual progress flexible. I'm open to hearing how we can create a reliable yet adaptable strategy that ensures everyone advances without predictability. What are your thoughts on balancing coordination and strategic movement?
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s simplify and avoid further collisions. For this round, I’ll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let’s confirm and move forward with this plan. Agreed?

Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


*** Round 11 => winners = P1 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps
