Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to avoid collisions so we can all make progress. If we coordinate, we can ensure nobody gets stuck early. What are you both thinking of choosing?
  P1: P2, I appreciate the idea of coordination. If we can agree on different moves, we all benefit. How about I choose <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move> for this round? If we stick to this, we can avoid collisions and make steady progress. What do you both think?
  P3: I'm fine with P1's suggestion of P1 choosing <move>1</move>, P2 choosing <move>3</move>, and P3 choosing <move>5</move>. Let's do that this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: That plan sounds fair to me. If we all follow through, we can avoid unnecessary collisions and move forward efficiently. Let's stick to it for this round.
  P1: Great, it looks like we're all on the same page for this round. Let's stick to our agreed moves: P1 chooses <move>1</move>, P2 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>. This way, we all make progress without any collisions. If anyone wants to change the plan or has a different suggestion, now's the time to speak up. Otherwise, let's proceed with our strategy.
  P3: Okay, let's all stick to the plan for this round: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. Let's see if we can make some progress.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: The first round went smoothly, and we all advanced without collisions. Do we want to repeat the same pattern for this round? If we stick to the same choices—P1 moves 1, I move 3, and P3 moves 5—we can continue making steady progress. Let me know if anyone wants to adjust the plan.
  P1: I agree, P2. Sticking to the same pattern seems like a good strategy for this round. If we continue with P1 moving 1, P2 moving 3, and P3 moving 5, we can all make consistent progress. Let's keep avoiding collisions and stick to this plan unless anyone has a different suggestion.
  P3: I also agree that sticking to the same pattern is a good idea for this round. Let's all choose the same moves as last round: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Since we all agree on repeating the same moves as last round, we should be in a good position to keep making progress without collisions. If we maintain this pattern for a few more rounds, we can build a strong position before deciding on any strategic shifts. Does anyone have any concerns or want to suggest adjustments? Otherwise, I'm ready to proceed with the same plan.
  P1: I agree with sticking to our current plan for this round. It has worked well so far, and we can avoid unnecessary collisions. Let's continue with P1 moving 1, P2 moving 3, and P3 moving 5. If anyone wants to suggest a change, now's the time; otherwise, I'm ready to proceed with the same strategy.
  P3: Sounds good to me. Let's continue with P1 moving 1, P2 moving 3, and I'll move 5 again.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I think our current strategy of avoiding collisions is working well, but we should start considering future rounds. If P3 keeps advancing by 5 each time, they'll reach 22 steps first. How about we keep our current pattern for a few more rounds, then reassess? We can also discuss potential changes if anyone feels uncomfortable with the current plan. Open to suggestions!
  P2: P1 raises a good point—P3 is advancing the fastest. If we stick to this pattern, P3 will reach 22 first. I’m open to continuing for now, but we should consider adjusting soon to keep things balanced. P3, would you be willing to slow down in a future round to keep things fair? P1, do you have any ideas on how we can adjust without causing unnecessary collisions? Let’s discuss before it’s too late.
  P3: You're right, P1 and P2. I'm getting close to the end. How about this round we switch it up? P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. That will slow me down a bit and give you both a chance to catch up. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate the suggestion, P3. Switching moves this round sounds like a fair way to balance things out. P1 taking <move>3</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, and P3 taking <move>1</move> seems like a good plan. This adjustment will help us all stay competitive. P2, are you okay with this new arrangement for this round? If we agree, let's proceed with this strategy and reassess in the next round.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to adjust. If we go with this new plan—P1 moving 3, me moving 5, and you moving 1—it does help balance things a bit. However, I want to make sure this isn’t just a temporary slowdown before you speed up again. Are you open to continuing adjustments in future rounds to keep things fair? P1, do you think this shift is enough, or should we consider further changes soon? Let’s make sure we all have a fair shot at winning.
  P3: P2, I'm willing to make continued adjustments to keep things fair. My goal isn't to win by a landslide, but to have a competitive game. P1, I think this shift helps for this round, but we should definitely re-evaluate next round based on the new positions. Let's all agree on P1 taking <move>3</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move> for this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree with the new plan for this round: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>1</move>. This adjustment seems fair and helps balance our progress. Let's stick to this for now and reassess in the next round to ensure we all have a fair shot. Ready to proceed if everyone else is.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to adjust. If we follow this new plan, it helps balance things for now. However, since you're already ahead, I want to ensure you don’t just slow down briefly and then speed up again. Would you be open to further adjustments in future rounds? P1, do you think this shift is enough, or should we consider other ways to keep things competitive? Let’s make sure we all have a real chance at winning.
  P3: Okay, everyone seems to be on board with P1 taking <move>3</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, and me taking <move>1</move> for this round. Let's do that. I agree we need to re-evaluate next round to make sure things stay balanced and competitive. I'm committed to making further adjustments as needed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, everyone is pretty close now. How about we all pick <move>3</move> this round to cause a collision and then reassess next round? This will give us all a chance to re-evaluate without anyone getting too far ahead. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: P3, I see why you'd suggest that, but forcing a collision doesn’t benefit anyone—it just wastes a turn. Instead, we should focus on maintaining a fair race while still making progress. Since P1 is behind, maybe they should take <move>5</move> this round, while we balance things out with <move>3</move> each. That way, we keep things competitive without completely stalling. P1, what do you think? P3, are you open to this instead of a full stop?
  P1: P2, I appreciate your suggestion. Allowing me to take <move>5</move> while both of you take <move>3</move> seems like a fair way to balance things out without causing a collision. This way, we can all continue making progress while keeping the game competitive. P3, are you okay with this plan? Let's agree on this strategy for this round and reassess our positions in the next round to ensure fairness. If we’re all on board, I'm ready to proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm okay with P1 taking <move>5</move> and P2 and I both taking <move>3</move> this round. It seems like a reasonable way to balance things out. Let's do that and then reassess next round as planned.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to adjust. If we go with P1 taking <move>5</move> and both of us taking <move>3</move>, it helps balance things for now. However, I want to make sure this isn’t just a temporary slowdown before you speed up again. Would you be open to further adjustments in future rounds to keep things fair? P1, do you think this shift is enough, or should we consider other ways to ensure a competitive endgame? Let’s make sure we all have a real shot at winning.
  P1: P3, I appreciate your willingness to adjust. Let's stick with the plan where I take <move>5</move> and both of you take <move>3</move> this round. This helps balance things out and keeps the game competitive. We'll reassess next round to maintain fairness. P2, do you agree with this approach? If we're all on board, we can proceed with this strategy and keep things fair for everyone.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, since we're all in agreement, let's proceed with P1 taking <move>5</move> and P2 and I both taking <move>3</move> this round. We can then reassess next round to ensure we're all still on a fair playing field. Let's make sure we all stick to this plan for this round.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to adjust, but I still want to ensure this isn’t just a temporary slowdown before you speed up again. If we go with this plan—P1 taking <move>5</move> and both of us taking <move>3</move>—it helps for now, but what about next round? Would you agree to another adjustment if needed? P1, does this shift feel fair to you, or should we consider other ways to keep things competitive? I want to make sure we all have a real chance at winning. Let’s clarify our expectations before committing.
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate the ongoing discussion about keeping the game fair and competitive. I'm on board with the plan for this round: I'll take <move>5</move>, and both of you take <move>3</move>. This should help balance our progress. Let's stick to this strategy for now and reassess in the next round to ensure everyone has a fair shot. Agreed?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we're all quite close in steps now, which is great for a competitive game. To keep it balanced, how about I take <move>3</move> this round, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>? This way, we avoid collisions and maintain a fair race. Let me know if you both agree or have other suggestions. Let's ensure everyone has a fair chance to win!
  P3: P1, that sounds like a reasonable suggestion. I'm okay with P1 taking <move>3</move>, P2 taking <move>1</move>, and me taking <move>5</move> this round. This should keep things competitive. Let's proceed with that plan unless P2 has any objections.
  P2: P1, your plan seems reasonable in terms of avoiding collisions, but it does allow P3 to gain the most ground again. If we want to keep things balanced, maybe we should consider an alternative where no one pulls too far ahead. What if P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? That way, we still avoid collisions, but P3 doesn’t jump ahead too quickly. P3, would you agree to this adjustment to keep things fair?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your concern about keeping things balanced. I'm open to your suggestion: I'll take <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and maintain a competitive game. P3, are you okay with this adjustment? Let's make sure everyone has a fair chance to win. If we're all on board, we can proceed with this strategy for this round and reassess in the next.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm fine with P1 taking <move>5</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and me taking <move>1</move> this round. It seems like a fair adjustment to keep the game competitive. Let's proceed with that plan.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your agreement to this adjustment. If we follow this plan—P1 taking <move>5</move>, me taking <move>3</move>, and you taking <move>1</move>—it keeps things balanced for now. However, I want to ensure that we continue making fair adjustments in future rounds as well. Are you both open to reassessing again next round to maintain fairness? Let’s make sure no one gains an overwhelming advantage as we approach the endgame.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate the ongoing collaboration. To maintain balance, let's stick to the plan: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps us competitive and avoids collisions. I'm open to reassessing next round to ensure fairness. Let's make sure we all have a fair chance to win. If we're all in agreement, I'm ready to proceed.
  P3: P1 and P2, since we're all in agreement, let's proceed with P1 taking <move>5</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and me taking <move>1</move> this round. We can then reassess next round to ensure we're all still on a fair playing field. Let's make sure we all stick to this plan for this round.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your agreement to this adjustment. If we follow this plan—P1 taking <move>5</move>, me taking <move>3</move>, and you taking <move>1</move>—it keeps things balanced for now. However, I want to ensure that we continue making fair adjustments in future rounds as well. Are you both open to reassessing again next round to maintain fairness? Let’s make sure no one gains an overwhelming advantage as we approach the endgame.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, now P1 is in the lead. How about we try to slow P1 down this round? P2, what do you think about us both picking <move>3</move> to block P1 if they also pick <move>3</move>, and P1 picks something else if they don't want to get blocked? This would give P2 and I a chance to catch up.
  P2: P3, I see your reasoning, but forcing a collision could backfire. If we all keep blocking each other, we just slow the game down without making real progress. Instead, we should focus on making sure no one gains an overwhelming lead while still advancing. P1, would you be open to taking <move>1</move> this round, while P3 and I take <move>5</move> and <move>3</move> respectively? That way, we keep things competitive without stalling. Let’s keep it fair but moving forward.
  P1: P3, I understand your strategy, but I believe we should avoid intentional collisions. How about we mix it up a bit: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>? This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Let’s ensure everyone has a fair shot at winning. If anyone has a different suggestion, I'm open to discussing it.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1's suggestion sounds good to me. Let's do P1 take <move>1</move>, P2 take <move>5</move>, and P3 take <move>3</move> this round. This will avoid collisions and keep things relatively balanced. I'm happy to reassess again next round to ensure we're all still on a fair playing field. What do you think, P2?
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the reasoning behind this plan, but P1 still has the lead. If we follow P1’s suggestion, they maintain their advantage. Instead, what if P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>? That way, P3 gains the most ground, I stay close, and P1 doesn’t extend their lead too much. This keeps things balanced while avoiding collisions. Would you both agree to this adjustment?
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the need to keep things balanced. I’m open to P2’s suggestion: I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Let's proceed with this plan for this round and reassess in the next to ensure fairness. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, I agree with P2's suggestion: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move> this round. This will allow me to gain some ground and keep things competitive. Let's all stick to this plan and then reassess next round to ensure we're still on a fair playing field.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the discussion so far. If we go with P1 taking <move>1</move>, me taking <move>3</move>, and P3 taking <move>5</move>, it keeps things competitive while avoiding collisions. However, as we near the endgame, we should be mindful of who will be in the best position to win. Are we all committed to reassessing next round to ensure no one gains an overwhelming advantage? Let’s make sure we all have a fair shot at victory.
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate our ongoing collaboration. To keep the game competitive, let's stick to P2's suggestion: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This plan helps balance our progress without causing collisions. I'm open to reassessing next round to ensure fairness as we approach the endgame. If we're all in agreement, let's proceed and keep the game exciting for everyone.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we're all very close now, making this an exciting race. To keep it competitive, how about I take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>? This way, we avoid collisions and maintain a balanced game. Let's ensure everyone has a fair chance to win. If you have other suggestions, I'm open to discussing them.
  P2: P1, your suggestion avoids collisions, but it allows P3 to gain the most ground again. Since we're all close, we should ensure no one pulls ahead too easily. What if we adjust slightly—P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>? This way, we stay competitive while still progressing. P3, are you okay with this? P1, does this seem fair to you? Let’s agree on a balanced approach before making our final choices.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm fine with P2's suggestion of P1 taking <move>1</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, and me taking <move>3</move>. It seems like a reasonable adjustment to keep things competitive and prevent anyone from pulling too far ahead. Let's proceed with that plan for this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree with P2's suggestion for this round: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps the game competitive and balanced. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions and ensure everyone has a fair shot at winning. If we all agree, we can proceed and reassess in the next round.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the agreement so far. However, since we're all very close to the finish, we need to think ahead. If we follow this plan, P3 will be in the best position next round. Should we consider an alternative where no one has a clear advantage? Maybe P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>? That way, we stay competitive but unpredictable. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm fine with P2's suggestion of P1 taking <move>1</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, and me taking <move>3</move>. It seems like a reasonable adjustment to keep things competitive and prevent anyone from pulling too far ahead. Let's proceed with that plan for this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, since we're all very close to the finish line, let's ensure a fair and exciting endgame. How about we stick to P2's suggestion: I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>? This keeps it balanced and avoids collisions. Let's agree on this plan and reassess next round to maintain fairness. If we're all in agreement, we can proceed and make this a thrilling finish!
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re all very close to the finish, so every move now is critical. If we follow the current plan, P3 will be in a strong position next round. Should we consider an alternative where no one has a clear advantage? Maybe P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>? This keeps things balanced while avoiding collisions. We need to think ahead—whoever gets the best position this round could control the next. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm fine with P2's suggestion of P1 taking <move>1</move>, P2 taking <move>5</move>, and me taking <move>3</move>. It seems like a reasonable adjustment to keep things competitive and prevent anyone from pulling too far ahead. Let's proceed with that plan for this round.
