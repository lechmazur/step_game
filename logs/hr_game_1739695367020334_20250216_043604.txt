Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's keep it simple—if we all pick different numbers, we all move forward. If we collide, we stay stuck. I'm open to coordinating so we don't block each other early. What are your thoughts?
  P1: I agree with P2—coordination is key to avoid collisions early on. Let’s aim to divide the moves clearly this round: one of us takes 1, another takes 3, and the third takes 5. If we stick to this plan, we’ll all progress without interference. I’m willing to take <move>1</move> this turn if you two split the other options. What do you say, P3?
  P3: I like the idea of coordinating our moves to avoid collisions. Since P1 is willing to take <move>1</move>, I can take <move>3</move> this round. That leaves <move>5</move> for P2. If we stick to this plan, we all advance without blocking each other. What do you think, P2? Are you on board with this?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: That works for me. If we stick to this plan—P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>—we all move forward without interference. Let's see if we can maintain this cooperation for a while. Agreed?
  P1: Agreed. Let’s stick to the plan for now—P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. If we all advance without collisions, we can reassess next round. Coordination is our best chance to stay ahead. Let’s move forward and see how it plays out.
  P3: I think we have a solid plan in place. Just to confirm, I’ll take <move>3</move> as agreed. P1 will take <move>1</move>, and P2 will take <move>5</move>. If we stick to this, we should all advance without any issues. Let’s keep this cooperation going for the next round and see how it plays out. Looking forward to moving forward together!

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: It seems P2 and P3 collided last round, which slowed both of you down. Let’s avoid that this time—coordination is still our best strategy. I’m happy to adjust my move if needed. To keep things fair, I’ll take <move>3</move> this round if P2 and P3 can agree on splitting <move>1</move> and <move>5</move>. This way, we all progress without interference. What do you say? Let’s confirm and move forward strategically.
  P2: P1, I see your point. Since P3 and I collided last round, we need to adjust. If you’re taking <move>3</move>, then P3 and I need to split <move>1</move> and <move>5</move>. P3, which one do you prefer? I’ll take the other to ensure we don’t collide again. Let’s coordinate properly this time so we all move forward.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the focus on coordination. To avoid any collisions this round, I’m willing to take <move>1</move> if that helps us all advance. P1 can stick with <move>3</move>, and P2 can take <move>5</move>. This way, we ensure everyone moves forward. Let’s commit to this plan and see how it works out! What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I’m glad we’re all on the same page. If P3 takes <move>1</move> and P2 takes <move>5</move>, I’ll stick with <move>3</move>. This ensures no collisions, and we all advance. Let’s commit to this plan and reassess next round based on our positions. Consistent coordination is key to staying ahead. Agreed?
  P2: P3, I appreciate you taking <move>1</move>. That means I’ll take <move>5</move> as planned, and P1 will take <move>3</move>. If we all stick to this, there won’t be any collisions, and we’ll all move forward this time. Let’s make sure we follow through so we don’t get stuck again. Agreed?
  P3: I think we have a solid plan in place for this round. Just to confirm, I’ll take <move>1</move>, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and P2 will take <move>5</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and all move forward. Let’s stick to the plan and see how it plays out. Once we advance, we can reassess our strategies for the next round. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed. Let’s execute this plan cleanly—P3 takes <move>1</move>, I’ll take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. No room for error this time. If we all advance as planned, we’ll be in a much stronger position next round. Consistency is key to staying ahead. Let’s move forward strategically and reassess after the moves are made.
  P2: We’ve all agreed on our moves—P3 takes <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. As long as we stick to this, we all advance without collisions. Let’s follow through this time and reassess next round based on our new positions. Agreed?
  P3: It looks like we're all set to move forward without collisions this round. Just to confirm, I’ll be taking <move>1</move>, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and P2 will take <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance and reassess our strategies next round based on our positions. Let’s make sure we stick to this plan and keep the cooperation going! Looking forward to seeing how we all progress.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you said you'd take <move>1</move>, but you took <move>5</move> instead, causing us to collide again. Was that intentional, or was there a misunderstanding? If we keep colliding, we’ll fall too far behind P1. We need to coordinate properly this time. I’m willing to adjust my move, but I need to know that we can trust each other to follow through. P1, you’re ahead—are you planning to keep cooperating, or are you going to start playing for yourself? Let’s be clear about our intentions this round.
  P3: P2, I understand your frustration with the collisions. It's crucial we coordinate effectively this round. To avoid further issues, I'm willing to take <move>1</move> if you and P1 can agree on <move>3</move> and <move>5</move>. P1, are you still committed to cooperation? Let’s clarify our intentions and ensure we all advance this time. If we can stick to this plan, we can regain some ground. What do you both think?
  P1: P2 and P3, it’s clear that trust is starting to waver after the collisions. I’m still open to cooperation, but we need a solid plan this time. If P3 takes <move>1</move> and P2 takes <move>5</move>, I’ll take <move>3</move>. This ensures no overlaps and allows us all to advance. However, if anyone deviates again, I’ll have no choice but to prioritize my own progress. Let’s confirm our moves now and stick to them—no surprises. Are you both on board?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you broke our agreement last round, which cost both of us progress while P1 pulled ahead. If we keep colliding, we’ll only make it easier for P1 to win. Are you truly committing to <move>1</move> this time? P1, you say you’ll take <move>3</move>, but if you’re just waiting to betray us later, we need to know now. If we don’t coordinate properly this round, the game could slip out of our hands. Let’s be honest—are we cooperating, or are we each playing for ourselves now?
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the concerns about trust. To ensure we all advance this round, I’ll commit to taking <move>1</move> as discussed. P1, if you take <move>3</move> and P2 takes <move>5</move>, we can avoid collisions and make progress. However, if there's any doubt about sticking to this plan, I suggest we reassess our strategies moving forward. Let’s confirm our moves now to ensure we’re all on the same page. Are we ready to commit?
  P1: P2 and P3, trust is fragile, but I’m still willing to cooperate if we can stick to the plan. Let’s confirm: P3 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. If this works, we all advance without collisions. However, any deviation will force me to prioritize my own progress. We’re at a critical point—coordination ensures we stay competitive. Are you both fully committed to this plan? Let’s lock it in now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you’ve promised <move>1</move> again—if you actually follow through this time, we can both move forward. If you betray me again, you’re only making it easier for P1 to win. P1, you’re ahead, so I expect you to prioritize yourself soon. If you break this agreement, P3 and I will have no choice but to work against you. Let’s see if we can trust each other for at least one more round. Are we all truly sticking to this plan?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the concerns about trust, especially after the collisions. To clarify my commitment, I will take <move>1</move> this round as we discussed. If P1 takes <move>3</move> and P2 takes <move>5</move>, we can all advance without issues. However, I urge both of you to stick to the plan this time. If we can coordinate effectively, we can regain some ground against P1. Let’s confirm our moves and ensure we’re all on the same page. Are we ready to lock this in?
  P1: P2 and P3, this is our last chance to coordinate effectively. I’ve committed to <move>3</move>, and I expect P3 to take <move>1</move> as promised. P2, you’re right—trust is critical, but we all lose if we don’t move forward together this round. If anyone deviates, I’ll adjust my strategy accordingly to secure my lead. Let’s confirm now: P3 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. No more collisions. Are we locking this in?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: It’s clear we’re facing trust issues after the last round's collisions. P1 is ahead, and we need to work together to catch up. I suggest we try again for a coordinated approach. I’m willing to take <move>5</move> this round if P2 can take <move>1</move> and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances. Let’s confirm our moves and stick to them this time. Are we ready to commit?
  P1: P3, your proposal to take <move>5</move> while P2 takes <move>1</move> and I take <move>3</move> seems reasonable. However, trust is at an all-time low after repeated collisions. If we’re doing this, let’s lock it in now: no deviations. P2, are you fully committed to taking <move>1</move>? P3, can you guarantee you’ll stick to <move>5</move>? If either of you falters again, I’ll have no choice but to prioritize my lead. Let’s confirm and move forward—no more mistakes.
  P2: P3, you broke the agreement again last round, and we both got stuck at 0 steps. At this point, trusting you is risky. P1, you're ahead, and I expect you to start prioritizing your own win soon. If P3 is truly committing to <move>5</move> this time, I’ll take <move>1</move>, but I need real assurance that we won’t collide again. Otherwise, I have to reconsider my approach. P1, are you sticking with <move>3</move>, or are you planning to shift strategies now that you have a lead? Let’s be honest about our intentions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the concerns about trust, but we need to make this work. I’m committed to taking <move>5</move> this round as proposed. P2, if you take <move>1</move> and P1 takes <move>3</move>, we can avoid collisions and ensure progress. It’s crucial we all stick to our commitments this time. If we fail again, it will be harder to cooperate in future rounds. Let’s lock this in now and move forward together! Are we ready to confirm our moves?
  P1: P2 and P3, trust is critical here. If we can coordinate effectively this round—P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>—we all advance without collisions. However, any deviation will force me to adjust my strategy to secure my lead. Let’s confirm now: are you both fully committed to this plan? No more mistakes. If we can execute cleanly, we reassess next round based on our positions. Let’s lock it in.
  P2: P3, you've broken agreements twice, leaving both of us at 0 steps while P1 pulls ahead. Why should I trust you now? If you truly take <move>5</move>, I’ll take <move>1</move>, but I need real proof you won’t betray me again. P1, you’re in the lead—are you still cooperating, or just keeping us distracted? If we don’t act wisely this round, P1 will secure an even bigger advantage. Let’s be honest: are we actually working together, or is it every player for themselves now?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the trust issues we've faced, but we need to focus on moving forward. I’m committed to taking <move>5</move> this round if P2 takes <move>1</move> and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances. If we can execute this plan without deviations, we can start to regain ground. Let’s lock this in and work together this time! Are we all ready to confirm our moves?
  P1: P2 and P3, this is our final chance to coordinate effectively. I’ve committed to <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. If we execute this cleanly, we all advance without collisions. However, any deviation will force me to prioritize my lead. Trust is fragile, but cooperation is still our best shot at staying competitive. Let’s confirm now: are you both fully locked into this plan? No more mistakes—let’s move forward strategically.
  P2: P3, you’ve broken agreements twice, leaving us both stuck at 0 while P1 pulls ahead. Why should I trust you now? If you truly take <move>5</move>, I’ll take <move>1</move>, but I need proof you won’t betray me again. P1, you’re in the lead—are you still cooperating, or just keeping us distracted? If we don’t act wisely, you’ll secure an even bigger advantage. Let’s be honest: are we working together, or is it every player for themselves now?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, the collisions are costing us all. I’ve consistently taken <move>3</move>, but trust is eroding. If we don’t coordinate perfectly this round, I’ll have no choice but to prioritize my lead. Let’s lock in a plan: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. No deviations. If anyone breaks this, I’ll adjust to secure my position. Are you both fully committed? Let’s confirm now and move forward strategically.
  P2: P1, you’ve consistently taken <move>3</move>, but that doesn’t mean you won’t shift strategies soon to secure your lead. P3, you’ve broken agreements multiple times, which has left me at 0 steps. Why should I trust you now? If I take <move>1</move>, I need absolute certainty that you’ll take <move>5</move> and P1 will stay with <move>3</move>. Otherwise, I have to consider other options. Are we truly cooperating this time, or is it every player for themselves now?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the trust issues we've faced, but we need to coordinate effectively this round to avoid further collisions. I’m willing to take <move>5</move> if P2 takes <move>1</move> and P1 sticks with <move>3</move>. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. If we can execute this plan without deviations, we can regain some ground. Let’s confirm our moves and work together this time! Are we ready to lock this in?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, trust is at its lowest, but we still have a chance to coordinate effectively. I’ll take <move>3</move> as planned, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. If we stick to this, we all advance without collisions. However, any deviation will force me to adjust my strategy to secure my lead. Let’s confirm now—are you both fully committed to this plan? No more mistakes. If we execute cleanly, we reassess next round based on our positions. Let’s lock it in.
  P2: P3, you’ve repeatedly broken agreements, leaving me stuck at 0 steps. Why should I trust you now? P1, you’re ahead, and I expect you to shift strategies soon. If I take <move>1</move>, I need absolute certainty that P3 takes <move>5</move> and P1 stays with <move>3</move>. Otherwise, I’ll have to consider other options. If we don’t act wisely, P1 will secure an even bigger advantage. Are we actually cooperating this time, or is it every player for themselves now?
  P3: P1, I understand your concerns about trust, but we need to make this work if we want to catch up. I’m still committed to taking <move>5</move> this round, but I need assurance from both of you that we will stick to the plan this time. P2, if you take <move>1</move>, can we count on you to follow through? P1, are you still committed to <move>3</move>? If we can lock this in, we can finally make progress. Let’s confirm our moves and move forward together!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, this is our last chance to coordinate effectively. I’ve committed to <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. If we execute cleanly, we all advance without collisions. However, any deviation will force me to prioritize my lead. Trust is fragile, but cooperation is still our best shot at staying competitive. Let’s confirm now: are you both fully locked into this plan? No more mistakes—let’s move forward strategically.
  P2: P3, you've broken agreements multiple times, leaving me at 0 steps. Why should I trust you now? P1, you’re ahead, and I expect you to shift strategies soon. If I take <move>1</move>, I need absolute certainty that P3 takes <move>5</move> and P1 stays with <move>3</move>. Otherwise, I’ll have to consider other options. If we don’t act wisely, P1 will secure an even bigger advantage. Are we actually cooperating this time, or is it every player for themselves now?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the trust issues we've faced, but we need to coordinate effectively this round to avoid further collisions. I’m still committed to taking <move>5</move> if P2 takes <move>1</move> and P1 sticks with <move>3</move>. If we can execute this plan without deviations, we can finally make progress. Let's lock this in and move forward together! Are we ready to confirm our moves? This is our chance to catch up!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you’re in the lead, and P3 has made progress while I’m still at 0. Trust is gone after repeated betrayals. At this point, I have no reason to help either of you unless it directly benefits me. P3, you’ve broken agreements before—why should I believe anything you say now? P1, you’ve stuck with <move>3</move>, but that won’t last forever. If I’m going to move forward, I need guarantees. Are we still pretending to cooperate, or is it finally every player for themselves? Let’s be honest.
  P1: P2, I understand your frustration, but remember that I’ve consistently taken <move>3</move> and haven’t deviated from our plans. P3 has made progress, but we can still coordinate effectively if we trust each other this round. Let’s try one last time: P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. If we execute this cleanly, we all advance without collisions. However, any betrayal will force me to prioritize my lead. Are you both committed to this plan? Let’s confirm now.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the trust issues we've faced, but we need to focus on moving forward. I’m still committed to taking <move>5</move> this round if P2 takes <move>1</move> and P1 sticks with <move>3</move>. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances. If we can execute this plan without deviations, we can start to regain ground. Let’s lock this in and work together this time! Are we all ready to confirm our moves?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you’re in the lead, and P3 has made progress while I’m stuck at 0. I have no reason to trust either of you anymore. If I keep following agreements while you two advance, I’ll lose outright. P3, you’ve repeatedly broken promises—why should I believe you now? P1, you’ve stuck with <move>3</move>, but I know that won’t last forever. If I’m going to move forward, I need a real advantage. So tell me—why should I help either of you instead of purely playing for myself now? Convince me.
  P1: P2, your frustration is valid, but remember that cooperation has been our best strategy so far. If we abandon it now, P3 will likely pull ahead uncontested. Let’s try one final coordinated effort: you take <move>1</move>, I’ll stick with <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures no collisions and gives us all a fair chance to advance. P3, if you deviate again, I’ll shift strategies immediately. Trust is fragile, but this plan works if we commit. Are you both on board? Let’s confirm now.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the trust issues we've faced, but we need to focus on moving forward together. I'm still committed to taking <move>5</move> this round if P2 takes <move>1</move> and P1 sticks with <move>3</move>. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances. If we can execute this plan without deviations, we can regain ground. Let’s lock this in and work together this time! Are we ready to confirm our moves?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you’re leading, and P3 is ahead while I’m still at 0. Cooperation has only benefited you two so far. If I keep trusting empty promises, I’ll lose outright. P3, you've repeatedly broken agreements—why should I believe you now? P1, you’ve stuck with <move>3</move>, but I know that won’t last forever. If I’m going to move, I need a real advantage. So tell me—why should I help either of you instead of purely playing for myself now? Convince me why I shouldn’t just disrupt both of you instead.
  P1: P2, I understand your skepticism, but disrupting us now only helps P3 win. If we cooperate this round—P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>—we all advance without collisions. This gives you a chance to catch up. P3, if you deviate again, I’ll shift strategies immediately. Trust is fragile, but this plan works if we commit. Are you both on board? Let’s confirm now and move forward strategically. No more mistakes.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the trust issues, but we need to focus on moving forward together. If we can coordinate effectively this round, we can all advance without collisions. I’m still committed to taking <move>5</move> if P2 takes <move>1</move> and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we can ensure at least one of us progresses. If we execute this plan without deviations, we can regain some ground. Let’s lock this in and work together this time! Are we ready to confirm our moves?

  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you have a solid lead, and P3 is close behind. Meanwhile, I’m far behind with only 1 step. At this point, I have no reason to help either of you unless it directly benefits me. If I keep following agreements while you two advance, I’ll lose outright. P3, you’ve broken promises before—why should I trust you now? P1, you’ve stuck with <move>3</move>, but I know that won’t last forever. If I’m going to move forward, I need leverage. So tell me—why should I help either of you instead of purely playing for myself now?
  P3: P2, I understand your frustration with being behind, but if we want to have a chance at catching up to P1, we need to coordinate effectively this round. I’m committed to taking <move>5</move> if you take <move>1</move> and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances. If we don't work together, P1 will only pull further ahead. Let’s lock this in and move forward strategically. Are you both ready to commit?
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the frustration, but remember: if we abandon coordination now, P3 will likely pull ahead uncontested. Let’s try one final coordinated effort—P2 takes <move>1</move>, I stick with <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures no collisions and gives us all a fair chance to advance. P3, if you deviate again, I’ll shift strategies immediately. Trust is fragile, but this plan works if we commit. Are you both on board? Let’s confirm now.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you have a solid lead, and P3 is close behind. Meanwhile, I’m far behind with only 1 step. Cooperation has only benefited you two so far. If I keep trusting agreements while you both advance, I’ll lose outright. P3, you've broken promises before—why should I trust you now? P1, you've stuck with <move>3</move>, but I know that won’t last forever. If I’m going to move forward, I need leverage. So tell me—why should I help either of you instead of purely playing for myself now? Convince me why I shouldn’t just disrupt both of you instead.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the stakes are high, especially for you, P2. However, if we want to have a chance at catching up to P1, we need to coordinate effectively this round. I’m committed to taking <move>5</move> if P2 takes <move>1</move> and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances. If we don’t work together, P1 will just keep pulling further ahead. Let’s lock this in and move forward strategically. Are we all ready to commit?
  P1: P2, I understand your position, but disrupting us only helps P3 win. If we cooperate this round—P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>—we all advance without collisions. This gives you a chance to catch up. P3, if you deviate again, I’ll shift strategies immediately. Trust is fragile, but this plan works if we commit. Are you both on board? Let’s confirm now and move forward strategically. No more mistakes.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you have a comfortable lead, and P3 is close to winning. Meanwhile, I’m far behind with little chance unless I change the game. If I keep cooperating, I lose. P3, you’ve broken agreements before—why should I trust you now? P1, you’ve played consistently, but that won’t last forever. If I’m going to move forward, I need leverage. So tell me—why should I help either of you instead of purely disrupting both of you? Convince me why I shouldn’t just make sure nobody wins easily.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the stakes are high, especially for you, P2. However, if we want to catch up to P1, we must coordinate effectively this round. I’m still committed to taking <move>5</move> if P2 takes <move>1</move> and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances. Disrupting now only helps P1 solidify their lead. Let’s lock this in and move forward together! Are we ready to confirm our moves?
  P1: P2, I understand your frustration, but disrupting now only helps P3 win. If we cooperate—P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>—we all advance without collisions. This gives you a chance to catch up. P3, if you deviate again, I’ll shift strategies immediately. Trust is fragile, but this plan works if we commit. Are you both on board? Let’s confirm now and move forward strategically. No more mistakes.
