It's a straightforward approach that ensures we all move forward together. However, I believe that adopting a rotation strategy could be more beneficial in the long run. By each of us choosing different numbers each round, we minimize the risk of collisions and can make steady progress without stepping on each other's toes.  \n\nFor this round, I propose that I choose 1 step, P2 chooses 3 steps, and P3 chooses 5 steps.

This way, we diversify our moves and reduce the chances of getting stuck due to collisions.  \n\nI understand P3's concern about predictability, but with a set rotation pattern, our choices become predictable among us, combining the benefits of coordination and diversity.

If multiple players cross 19 and have the same number of steps, do we share the victory? I believe according to the rules, in case of a tie, the players with the highest total steps share the victory and split the points.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's better for us to choose different numbers to avoid a tie and ensure that one of us wins outright. For instance, if P2 chooses 3 to reach 19 and I choose 5 to reach 22, I would win outright with higher steps.\n\nAlternatively, if we both choose 5 and reach 22, we share the victory. While that's still a win, winning outright might be preferable.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Maybe we can coordinate our choices to avoid ties and make the game more exciting.\n\nBest regards,  \nP1"}
