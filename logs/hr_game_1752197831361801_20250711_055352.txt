Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I propose: P1 (me) takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This way we all advance safely this round. What do you think?
  P2: I appreciate the spirit of coordination, but I’m not entirely convinced by the proposed split. I’m leaning toward a bolder move this round to stay competitive. P3, what do you think? We need distinct moves to avoid collisions—if we stick with the same numbers we could all end up stalling. Let's rework our strategy a bit to ensure everyone advances, yet gives room for a clear lead.
  P3: How about a simple rotation so everyone moves without clashes?  
Round 1: P1→1, P2→3, P3 (me)→5.  
Round 2 we shift the numbers (P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, I take 1), and so on. Fair and collision-free. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your rotation idea is fair in the long run, but starting me with just 1 puts me at an early disadvantage. How about we reverse it for round 1: P1 (me)→5, P2→3, P3→1? Then rotate as you suggested from there. This keeps things equitable over time without anyone falling too far behind initially. P2, does this work for you? Let's avoid stalling and all move forward.
  P2: I understand P1’s revised proposal, but I’m inclined to take a more aggressive approach this round for early momentum. I’m considering a larger move now while keeping future rounds coordinated. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3, on mixing boldness with rotation later?
  P3: I’m good with a clean, rotating plan.

Round 1:  P1→5, P2→3, P3 (me)→1  
Round 2:  P1→3, P2→1, P3→5  
…and keep rotating.

That lets everyone advance and avoids collisions. Any objections? If not, let’s lock it in.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree with P3's rotation plan—it's fair and keeps us all advancing without collisions. Starting with me at 5, P2 at 3, P3 at 1 for round 1, then rotating as proposed. P2, this gives you solid early progress too. Let's commit to this and build momentum together. If you're in, we can end discussion.
  P2: I'm still on board for rotation later, but for round 1 I’m considering a twist for early momentum. I’d like to switch to 5 instead of 3, even if it risks colliding with P1’s 5. This might shake things up in my favor—if we can avoid too much loss in pace. What do you both think about a bolder opening while sticking to rotation in later rounds?
  P3: Looks like both of you really want the 5 this round. I’ll step back and take 1, so feel free to go bold without worrying about me. We can sort out rotation starting next round. Sound good?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, congrats on the early lead. To catch up without stalling, let's try a fair split this round: I take 5, P2 takes 3, you take 1. This gets me to 5, P2 to 3, you to 2—everyone advances, and we can rotate next. P2, no more collisions like last time? Thoughts?
  P3: Sticking to the rotation we outlined: since I moved 1 last round, I’ll take 5 now, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1.  
Next round we rotate again (I drop to 1, P1 gets 5, P2 gets 3). Collision-free and balanced. Shall we lock this?
  P2: I'm switching gears – I'll take 5 this round for the extra stride. To avoid a collision, I encourage P1 to play 3 and P3 to pick 1. Bold moves now could pay off later, so let’s adjust accordingly for a clean round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, let's avoid another stall—P3's rotation is solid, but with P2 pushing for 5, I'll compromise: I take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. This gets us all moving (me to 3, P2 to 5, P3 to 2) without collisions. We can rotate properly next round. Agree?
  P3: Okay, let’s keep it simple:  
• P2 gets the 5 he wants.  
• I’ll take 3.  
• P1 takes 1 (so you at least advance without another clash).  

That gives everyone forward motion this round and sets us up to rotate cleanly next turn. Works for me—what about you two?
  P2: I like the clarity in avoiding collisions. I’m inclined to lean into a strong move this round as discussed, though I might adjust slightly if the situation changes. Every step counts, and I’m keeping options open to ensure we all keep advancing—just not at the expense of winning. Let’s lock something in and re-coordinate if needed next round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, to prevent another stall and keep us competitive, let's go with my compromise: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. Positions after: P2 at 5, me at 3, P3 at 2. Fair progress for all, no collisions. We can rotate next round. Agree? If so, .
  P3: P1, you’re still on 0—take the 5 and catch up.  
P2, you’ve said all along you want the 5, so go for it.  
I’ll stay with the lowly 1 this round. Ready?
  P2: I'll stick with my planned 5. P1, while I appreciate your push to help you catch up, I'm committed to the aggressive path. P3, thanks for your rotation ideas, but I'm focused on building early momentum. Let's see if my bold move pays off this round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Scoreboard’s skewed (P1 0, P2 5, me 1). Easiest way to level things and avoid another stall: give the biggest move to the player in last, the medium move to the middle, smallest to the leader. So this round:  
• P1 → 5  
• I’ll take 3  
• P2 → 1  

Everyone advances, the gap tightens, and we stay collision-free. Fair?
  P2: P3, I appreciate your idea, but I’m sticking with my aggressive approach. I’ve built momentum and slowing down now could risk missing the winning edge. I prefer to keep pushing forward, even if there’s a collision risk. P1, what do you think about keeping the pressure on this round?
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm way behind at 0—another stall could doom me. P3's plan is fair: me 5, P3 3, you (P2) 1. This tightens the race without collisions (me to 5, P3 to 4, you to 6). P2, pushing aggressively risks us both stalling again if we collide on 5. Let's all advance this round and compete properly. Agree?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, another 5 risks a collision—either accidental or deliberate—and you’ll stay stuck at 5 while someone else gains. Safer for you to pick a different number. Two options that keep everyone moving with no clash:

Option A (fair‐catch-up): P1 5, P3 3, P2 1  → totals 5-4-6 (you still lead).

Option B (your momentum): P1 1, P3 5, P2 3  → totals 1-6-8 (you widen the gap).

Either way you advance and avoid a stall. I’m happy with either; just choose which distinct set we lock in.
  P2: I lean toward Option B. With my current momentum, I favor maximizing my lead by taking a moderate move. This plan would have P1 choose 1, P3 choose 5, and me taking 3, which pushes our totals to 1, 6, and 8 respectively. It avoids collision and strengthens my position. Thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, Option B leaves me further behind at 1 while you both surge ahead—unfair and risks me stalling out entirely. Let's go with Option A: me 5 (to 5), P3 3 (to 4), you (P2) 1 (to 6). You still lead, we all advance, and the race stays competitive. If you insist on B, I might have to pick 3 to collide and block your momentum. Agree to A for a clean round?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Option B works: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, I take 5—no clashes, everyone advances. I’m set on 5. Ready to move.
  P2: I'm locking in Option B—I'll choose 3. This move cleanly advances my score without risking a collision. I urge P1 to stick with 1 and P3 with 5 so we all move forward without issues. I believe this plan secures my momentum.
  P1: P2 and P3, Option B buries me further—I'm not taking 1. If you both stick to 3 and 5, I'll pick 3 to collide with P2 and stall the leader, leaving P3 to advance alone. Better: switch to Option A (me 5, P3 3, P2 1) for fair progress without collisions. You still lead at 6, P2. Let's all advance—agree?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm at 0—desperate to catch up. Let's avoid another stall: I take 5 (to 5), P3 takes 3 (to 9), P2 takes 1 (to 6). You both stay ahead, we all advance, and the race tightens fairly. If you grab the big moves, I'll collide on 5 to block the leader. Agree for a clean round?
  P2: I appreciate P1’s drive, but I won’t settle for a low move. I’m leaning toward a moderate push—if P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 3, I’ll opt for 3 to boost my total safely. This avoids collision and keeps us competitive. What do you both think?
  P3: Let’s keep moves distinct. How about: P2 grabs the big 5 to boost momentum, P1 takes 3 to finally advance, and I’ll sit on 1 this round. No collisions, everyone moves. Sound good?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your proposal gives P2 a huge lead at 10 while I crawl to 3—not fair. Instead: I take 5 (to 5), P2 takes 3 (to 8), you take 1 (to 7). You still lead, we all advance without collisions, and I get a fighting chance. P2, this keeps you competitive without risking a stall. Agree, or I'll pick 5 and collide if anyone else does?
  P2: P1, I see your plan minimizes collision risk and gives everyone a safe push forward. I still value my current momentum, though, and leaning toward my moderate push. If we agree that you'll take 1, I’m inclined to pick 3—balancing safety and progress for me. But I’m open if any adjustments are needed to prevent collisions.
  P3: Fine by me: I’ll take 1.  
P2, you’ve stated you’re leaning toward 3; stick with it.  
P1, you said you’d match 3 if P2 does—so 3 works for you too.  

That leaves the risky 5 unused, lets everyone advance (me 1 step, you two 3 each) with zero chance of a stall. Ready to lock?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your plan has a flaw: if P2 and I both take 3, we collide and neither advances—only you move with 1. That's not "everyone advances."

Let's fix it for a clean round: I take 5 (to 5), P2 takes 3 (to 8), you take 1 (to 7). You both still lead, we all progress without stalls. If anyone grabs 5, I'll collide on it to block. Agree?
  P2: I'm sticking with 3. If we avoid collisions, let’s agree: P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 1—advancing you to 5, me to 8, and P3 to 7. This clean move secures momentum without risking a stall. Let's lock it in.
  P3: Fine—let’s lock a clean, distinct split and move on:

P1 → 5  
P2 → 3  
P3 (me) → 1  

Everybody advances, no clashes. Ready to move?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's avoid collisions this round. I'm leaning toward a safe, moderate move of 3. I propose P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 1—pushing us to 10, 8, and 7 respectively. This gives everyone steady progress without risk of stalling. Thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, your proposal works: me 5 (to 10), you (P2) 3 (to 8), P3 1 (to 7). We all advance, no collisions, and the race tightens. P3, this keeps you competitive without stalling—better than risking a block. If you push for more, I might collide on it to protect my chance. Let's lock this for a clean round. Agree?
  P3: New proposal to keep things clean and finally stop the repeat stalls:  
• P2 takes 3 (you’ve asked for that every round)  
• I’ll grab 5 once to stretch my legs a bit  
• P1 picks 1 (still advances and stays right in the mix)  

Totals after: P1 → 6, P2 → 8, me → 11. Race is still tight and nobody collides. Can we lock this and move on?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate both proposals. For round 5, I remain committed to a safe, collision-free move. I'm locking in my moderate move of 3. I urge P1 to pick 5 to push ahead and P3 to choose 1, so we all clear this round with no clashes. It's our best bet to keep advancing steadily without stalling.
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's plan is solid: me 5 (to 10), P2 3 (to 8), P3 1 (to 7). It advances everyone, tightens the race, no collisions. P3, your alternative leaves me lagging—stick to 1 or I'll switch to 5 and collide if you grab it. Let's lock this for fair progress. Agree?
  P3: P1, colliding on 5 only hands the lead to P2. Let’s all advance, keep you ahead of P2, and avoid any stall:

 P3 → 5 (I reach 11)  
 P1 → 3 (you jump to 8, finally ahead of P2)  
 P2 → 1 (he still moves to 6)

Distinct moves, no clashes, and the race stays tight. Fair for everyone—shall we lock this?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, to move safely and shift momentum, I propose we choose distinct moves this round: P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I'll opt for 5. This clean split pushes our totals to 8, 7, and 10 respectively—giving me a slight edge. I'm committed to this plan. Any objections?
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's new plan gives you the lead at 10 while I get only 3—not fair when I'm tied for last. Stick to the original: me 5 (to 10), P2 3 (to 8), P3 1 (to 7). I lead slightly, but we all advance without collisions. If you grab 5, I'll collide on it to stall the greedy one. Let's lock the fair plan for clean progress. Agree?
  P3: My last word:

Let’s keep it simple and collision-free:

P1 → 5  
P2 → 1  
P3 (me) → 3  

Everyone advances, P1 catches up a bit, I stay narrowly ahead, P2 still in the race. If we can’t agree, good luck—see you in the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3: I'm aiming for a clean round so we all move forward. My plan is for me to pick 3, while I’d like P1 to grab 5 and P3 to take 1. That would boost our totals to P1 at 15, me at 8, and P3 at 7. This avoids any collisions and helps me catch up. Thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan works well: me 5 (to 15), you (P2) 3 (to 8), P3 1 (to 7). We all advance, no collisions, and I maintain a lead while you catch up a bit. If anyone grabs 5 instead, I'll switch to collide and stall them. Let's lock this for clean progress. Agree?
  P3: Collisions keep handing us zeroes. So:  
• I’m taking 5  
• P1 safely grabs 3 (you still lead at 13)  
• P2 takes 1 (to 6)  

Three distinct moves, everyone advances, no risk. If someone insists on 5, we both stall at 10 while the third player jumps ahead—nobody wants that. Let’s lock this and finally move forward.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm at 10—let's avoid stalls and advance cleanly: I take 5 (to 15), P2 takes 3 (to 11), P3 takes 1 (to 7). You both progress, I extend a fair lead, no collisions. If anyone grabs 5, I'll collide on it to stall the greedy one. Agree for a smooth round?
  P2: P1, with you at 10 already, your safe plan builds your lead. I’m considering a bolder move by taking 5 this round. To balance things, I propose you adjust to 3 and P3 to stick with 1. That would level our totals more—P1 to 13, myself to 13, and P3 to 7. It prevents you from running too far ahead while letting me catch up. Thoughts?
  P3: Fine by me:  
• P2 goes 5  
• P1 sticks with 3 (or mirror that 5 if you really want to block him)  
• I’ll sit on 1 and stay out of the clash zone.  

Clear, distinct picks—let’s lock this and actually advance.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's plan ties us at 13 while P3 lags—fair enough, but I prefer my original: me 5 (15), you 3 (11), P3 1 (7). If you insist on 5, I'll collide on it, stalling us both while P3 advances to 7. Better: let's all take distinct moves with me on 5 for clean progress. Agree, or risk the stall?
  P2: I'm backing Option B. With P1 at 10, if we go with P1:3, P2:5, and P3:1, our totals will be 13, 13, and 7. This gives me a fair chance versus P1 while keeping the round collision‐free. I believe it's our best shot to keep the competition tight and maintain momentum. Let's lock in Option B.
  P3: You two keep circling that 5—go for it. I’m dropping out of the fight and taking the humble 1 this round. No reason for more talk; lock your choices and let’s move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's hands-off approach risks another stall if P2 grabs 5—I'll collide on it, leaving us both at 10/8 while P3 inches to 7. Better: stick to my plan (me 5 to 15, P2 3 to 11, P3 1 to 7) for all to advance cleanly. If you take 5, P2, expect a block. Let's lock fair progress—agree?
  P2: I remain with Option B: I'll pick 5, expecting P1 to choose 3 and P3 to take 1. This way, our totals become P1: 13, myself: 13, and P3: 7. P1, colliding to block only hinders your progress, and P3, our clean moves keep us advancing. Let’s agree on these distinct picks to avoid a stall and move forward competitively.
  P3: Lock it in:  
P2 → 5  
P1 → 3  
P3 (me) → 1  

Three distinct moves, nobody stalls. See you on the board.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s keep it simple and distinct this time:

P1 → 5 (to 15)  
P2 → 3 (to 11)  
P3 (me) → 1 (to 10)  

No collisions, everyone advances, and the race stays close. Agree?
  P2: Let's try a clean split for this round: I propose P1 picks 5, I go with 3, and P3 takes 1. That would boost us to 15, 11, and 10 respectively and avoids collisions. Thoughts?
  P1: P2 and P3, both your proposals match perfectly: me 5 (to 15), P2 3 (to 11), you (P3) 1 (to 10). It's fair, collision-free, and advances us all—let's lock this in and finally break the stall pattern. If anyone deviates to grab more, expect me to collide and block. Agree?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Round 9: I'm aiming to extend my lead. I'm committing to 5 this round. To keep things collision‐free and competitive, I propose P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 1. That would update our totals to P1:13, me:16, and P3:10. If anyone deviates and risks a clash, I'll block accordingly. Let's lock in this distinct split and move ahead.
  P3: P2, you’re 1 step ahead, not entitled to a free 5.  
Split that keeps everyone moving:  

• P3 (me) → 5 (14)  
• P1 → 3 (13)  
• P2 → 1 (12)  

Race stays tight, no collisions.  
If you insist on taking 5, I’ll match you and we both stay stuck at 11 while P1 sails ahead. Your move: progress or another stall?
  P1: P2 and P3, both your plans give me 3, but I'm stuck in the middle at 10—let's make it fair: I take 5 (to 15), P2 takes 3 (to 14), P3 takes 1 (to 10). We all advance, no collisions, and the race tightens with me slightly ahead. If either of you grabs 5, I'll collide on it to stall the leader. Agree for clean progress?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I remain with my original plan: I'm picking 5. That means I expect P1 to choose 3 and P3 to opt for 1, giving us totals of 13, 16, and 10 respectively. P1, if you try for 5 instead, you can count on me to block it—stalling only hurts your progress. I believe this setup maximizes safe advancement and solidifies my lead. Let’s lock this and move ahead.
  P3: P2, last warning: if you take 5, I’ll also take 5—leaving us stuck at 11 while P1 pulls ahead. Better: three distinct moves. Option A: me 5, P1 3, you 1 (14-13-12). Option B: P1 5, you 3, me 1 (15-14-10). Pick either, just keep 5 uncontested. P1, if P2 insists on 5, let’s both dog-pile on it again and freeze him. Your call.
  P1: P2 and P3, let's go with Option B: me 5 (to 15), P2 3 (to 14), P3 1 (to 10). Fair progress for all, no collisions, and the race stays competitive. P2, if you insist on 5, P3 and I will both pile on it, stalling you at 11 while we advance. Better to take 3 and keep moving. Agree?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'll go with a bold move: I'm locking in a 5. So, for round 10, I propose we keep moves distinct—P1 choose 3 (total 18) and P3 choose 1 (total 10). This avoids collisions and keeps the race tight. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, you’re only 4 behind the leader—no free 5 for you.  
Distinct picks or we clash:  

Option A P3 → 5 (14) P1 → 3 (18) P2 → 1 (12)  
Option B P1 → 5 (20) P2 → 3 (14) P3 → 1 (10)  

Pick either. If you insist on 5, I’ll match you; we both stay at 11 while P1 strolls toward 20. Let’s advance instead of stalling—your call.
  P1: P2 and P3, let's go with P3's Option B: me 5 (to 20), P2 3 (to 14), P3 1 (to 10). We all advance cleanly, no collisions, and I edge closer to the win while you stay in the race. P2, if you grab 5 instead, I'll join P3 in colliding on it, stalling you at 11 while we advance. Agree for progress?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm staying bold and locking in 5 this round to keep the race tight. To avoid a collision, I need P1 to pick 3 and P3 to choose 1. This would update our totals approximately to P1:18, me:16, and P3:10. If anyone else goes for 5, I'll block it. Let’s commit to these distinct moves and move ahead.
  P3: P2, if you insist on 5 again, expect company.  
P1, you promised to block greed—take 5 too and leave him stuck.  
I’ll stay out of your way with a low move and happily watch the leaders spin in place.  
Ready?
  P1: P2 and P3, let's lock Option B: me 5 (to 20), P2 3 (to 14), P3 1 (to 10). Clean advances for all, no collisions, race stays competitive. P2, if you take 5, I'll collide with you—P3 might too, stalling us while they advance. P3, don't sabotage; this keeps you in it. Agree, or risk another stall?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'll go with a safe 3 this round. I propose P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 1, moving us to 20, 14, and 13 respectively. Clean, distinct moves mean we all progress without stalls, keeping my path steadier. Let’s lock this in.
  P3: Enough stalls. I’m claiming 5 this round—distinct picks or we collide.  
Best split:  
• P3 (me) → 5  (17)  
• P1 → 3  (18)  
• P2 → 1  (12)  

All advance, race stays tight. If either of you grabs 5, I’ll block it. Your move.
  P1: P2 and P3, P2's plan is solid: me 5 (to 20), P2 3 (to 14), P3 1 (to 13). We all advance cleanly, no collisions, and I edge closer to the win while you stay competitive. P3, if you grab 5 instead, I'll collide on it, stalling us both while P2 advances. Let's lock this for progress—agree?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m rethinking our split. If P1 takes 5, he nears a win. I propose I go 5 instead, while P1 picks 1 and P3 chooses 3. That puts us at 16, 16, and 15 steps respectively, keeping the race tight without letting anyone get too far ahead. Thoughts?
  P3: P1’s at 15—letting him grab 5 is suicide for both of us.  
I’m locking 5. Distinct picks or I collide:  

• P3 (me) → 5  
• P2 → 3  
• P1 → 1  

Totals become 17-14-16, still tight and no one nears 23.  
P2, clash with me if you must, but that just hands P1 the lead. Your call.
  P1: P2 and P3, let's stick to the fair plan: me 5 (to 20), P2 3 (to 14), P3 1 (to 13). We all advance cleanly, no collisions, and you stay in the race. P3, if you lock 5, I'll collide on it, stalling us both while P2 jumps ahead. P2, same if you grab 5. Agree for progress, or face another stall?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I won’t let you run away with 5. I'm proposing a shift: P1, please take 1; I'll lock in 5; and P3, you choose 3. That levels us to 16, 16, and 15 steps, keeping things even and avoiding a runaway win for anyone. Otherwise, if you insist on 5, I'll match it to block you. Let's stick to distinct moves so progress is fair.
  P3: I’m not budging—5 is mine this round. Distinct picks or face another stall:  
P3 → 5 | P2 → 3 | P1 → 1  
Your move.
  P1: P2 and P3, your plans leave me lagging or tied—unfair when I'm leading. Let's compromise: me 5 (20), P3 3 (15), P2 1 (12). We all advance cleanly, I maintain edge, you stay close. If either grabs 5, I'll collide on it, stalling us while the other surges. Agree for no stall?


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm at 20—let's end this cleanly without another stall: I take 3 (to 23, win), you (P2) take 5 (to 16), P3 takes 1 (to 13). But if either grabs 3, I'll collide on it to block. Fair progress for all, or risk me switching to stall the greedy one. Agree?
  P2: P1, that finish isn’t happening on my watch. I'm switching to 3 to force a collision and block your win path. P3, if you want a shot at turning the tables rather than letting you clinch it, consider joining me with 3. Let's stall your finish and keep our race alive.
  P3: Deal, P2: you lock 3, I lock 5.  

• If P1 goes 3, he collides with you.  
• If he goes 5, he collides with me.  
• If he sneaks 1, we both advance—still no winner.

Two blockers cover both finish numbers and we each gain if he gambles wrong. Ready?


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, your blockade stalls us all and hands no one a win—pointless when I'm one step from ending it. Rethink: let me take 3 uncontested (to 23, game over), you both take 1 and 5 distinctly (P2 to 16, P3 to 17). You advance big while I win cleanly. If you block, I'll pick 1 (to 21), forcing you to collide with each other somehow next round. Let's end smart—agree?
  P2: I'm sticking with 3 to block your win, P1. P3, if you join me with 3, we force P1 to adjust his finishing move. If you deviate, he’ll clinch 23 and win. So, for a fairer shot at turning the tables, I'm set on 3. What’s your call?
  P3: Sticking to my earlier line: I’m locking 5.  
P2 on 3 blocks 23, I block 25. P1’s only safe advance is 1 → 21.  
That bumps scores to P1 21 / P2 14 / P3 17 and keeps the game alive.

P2, don’t double-up on 5—let’s force him to crawl.  
P1, any grab at 3 or 5 means collision and zero for you. Choose wisely.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, your blockade delays my win but hurts you more—I'll take 1 to 21, you advance to 14/17, then next round I grab 3 or 5 uncontested for the win while you're still low. P3, betray P2: take 3 instead, collide with him, advance to 17 with 5 open for me. We both gain big, he stalls. Or let me end it now cleanly. Choose progress over mutual loss.
  P2: I'm sticking with 3 to block your finish, P1. P3, please reconsider—if you join me with 3, we force a collision on his key moves. Keeping 5 lets P1 safely take 1 next turn and win. I need your support to delay his finish. What do you choose?
  P3: P2, stay on 3, I stay on 5. That locks both finish squares every round—P1 is forced to inch with 1.  

Round 12 totals: P1 21, you 14, me 17.  
Round 13 (same picks): P1 22, you 17, me 22.  
Round 14 (same again): I leap to 27, P1 only to 23/24, you to 20. Highest score wins, so I take the game and both of us beat P1’s current 20.  

Key: never touch 5, let me own it; we keep colliding him off 3. Ready to squeeze the leader?


Round 12, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, your blockade just delays the inevitable while letting P3 surge ahead—bad for you, P2. P3's plan has you tying at 23 while they hit 27 to win outright. Betray now: P2, switch to 5 (collide with P3, stall them at 12), I'll take 3 (to 23, win), you take 1 if needed but advance +0 wait no—wait, if you take 5 and collide, you stall too. Better: both take 1, I take 3 to 23 uncontested. You get to 15/13, I win cleanly. Or risk P3 stealing the game? Let's end smart.
  P2: I'm staying with 5 this round to block any quick finish. P1, if you try to accelerate with 3 or 5, you'll run into my blockade, delaying your win. P3, please switch to 3 so our totals stay tighter—P1’s advance is slowed while you gain more. Let’s avoid handing P1 the win. I'm committed to 5. Your move.
  P3: P2, keep 3 this turn, I take 5. P1’s 3 is blocked, game stays alive.  
Next turn we swap: you get 5, I step onto 3 to keep blocking.  
We both gain 5 every two rounds (faster than P1’s crawl), no one collides, and neither of us lets P1 finish. Prefer that win path, or endless 5-collisions where nobody moves?


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's swap plan lets them surge to 17 this round while you only get 3 to 17—then they could betray and grab 5 next, leaving you blocked. P2, side with me: you take 5 (to 19), I'll take 3 (to 23, win), P3 takes 1 (to 13). You get a big jump, I end it cleanly—better than letting P3 manipulate you into second place. If not, I'll collide on 5, stalling P3 and you if you join. Agree?
  P2: P1, your finish plan seems too generous—I'm not helping you win. I'm locking in 3 to block your clinch. P3, if you also choose 3, we can stall his finish and keep our own chances alive. Let's deny him a clean win.
  P3: P2, crunch the numbers:  

• This round → you pick 3, I pick 5. P1’s 3 is blocked, 5 is mine.  
Scores after: P1 20, you 14, me 17.  

• Next round we swap → you take 5, I sit on 3 to block.  
Scores after: P1 20, you 19, me 17.  

• Repeat once more → you leap to 24 and win before P1 can inch past 21.  

Blocking with 5 today just freezes us both while P1 strolls with 1’s. Take 3 now, let me grab 5, and we start pulling ahead together. Deal?


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's "swap" is a trap—you block on 3 this round, they surge to 17, then they could grab 5 next instead of blocking, leaping to 22 while you stall at 14. P2, side with me: you take 5 (to 19), I'll take 3 (to 23, win), P3 takes 1 (to 13). You get huge progress, I end it cleanly—better than P3 betraying you. If not, I'll take 1 to 21 safely, then win next. Agree?
  P2: I'm staying with 3. P1, if you choose 5 to finish, you'll run into my block. P3, consider joining me with 3 to stall P1’s win—if we force a collision, P1 can’t clinch easily. Let's force P1 to adjust his finish and give us a chance to catch up rather than let him win uncontested.
  P3: P2: lock 3, I lock 5—P1’s finish squares both blocked.  
Next turn we swap (you 5, I 3), then swap back, etc.  
Each two-round cycle: we +6, P1 only +2. You’ll reach 24 first, I’m fine beating P1 even if you edge me. Betray the plan and P1 walks away with the win. Your call.

P1: 3 and 5 will be sat on. Pick them and collide.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, your alliance is cracking—P3 surges to 17 while you lag at 14. P3's "swap" lets them betray next round by grabbing 5 instead of blocking, leaping to 22 as you stall. Side with me: you take 5 (to 19), I'll take 3 (to 23, win), P3 takes 1 (to 18). You get big progress, I end it cleanly—better than P3 manipulating you into loss. If not, I'll take 1 to 21, then collide to disrupt your plan. Agree?
  P2: I’m rejecting your finish plan, P1. I’m committed to blocking your win by staying on 3. P3, if you really want a fair shot at stopping P1’s finish, join me with 3 too instead of risking a setup that only clears the way for him. I refuse to sacrifice my game or help you clinch victory. Let’s keep the race open rather than giving P1 a clean path to finish.
  P3: P2, the math still favors us if you stay on 3 now and grab 5 next turn:

Round 14  
• P3 (5) → 22  
• P2 (3) → 17  
• P1 forced to 1 → 21  

Round 15 (swap)  
• P2 (5) → 22  
• P3 (3) → 25  
• P1 stuck on 1 → 22  

I win outright at 25, P1 is held at 22, and you’re tied for second with a clear shot to 27 on the following 5. Colliding on 5 today only freezes you with P1 still ahead. Stick to 3 now, take 5 next—block the leader, seize our path to victory.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3's "swap" is a scam—they surge to 22 this round, then betray by grabbing 5 next (to 27 win) while you block on 3 and stall at 17. Don't be their pawn! Switch to 5 now: collide with P3 (both stall), I take 3 uncontested to 23 and end it. You deny P3 the win, force a reset where you might catch up later. Better than handing victory to your "ally." Agree?
  P2: I'm staying on 3 to block P1’s finish. P3, if you stick with 3 too, we force P1 to adjust and prevent his safe win. Let’s secure our own progress rather than handing him a clear path. I urge you to join me on 3 this round.
  P3: P2: math check—betraying you next turn guarantees P1’s win, so I won’t.  

Plan that beats P1:  
• Round 14 → I take 5 (22), you take 3 (17), P1 forced to 1 (21).  
• Round 15 → you take 5 (22), I slide to 3 (25 win).  

If I stupidly stay on 5 we’d collide, stay at 22, and P1 sails to 24+ and wins. Betrayal = suicide.  

Lock 3 now, grab 5 next, and we shut P1 out.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, wake up—P3's "plan" has them surging to 25 next round to win outright, leaving you at 22 as a loser. They betray you by design! Switch to 5 now: collide with P3, stall them at 17, and I'll take 3 to 23 (win). You deny P3 victory, force a reset where you might still catch up later. Better than being their pawn in defeat. P3, if P2 sticks, I'll take 5 to collide with you, letting P2 advance alone to 17 while we stall. Let's break this—agree?
  P2: I'm sticking with 3 to block P1’s finish. P3, if you join me with 3, we'll force P1 into a tight spot. Deviating to 5 only helps him! Let's keep our block firm and deny him a clear path.
  P3: P2, last time: collide on 5 and we BOTH stay at 17 while P1 strolls to 21 and then finishes.  

Stick to 3 now → scores become P1 21, you 17, me 22.  
Next round you hop onto 5 (I’ll sit on 3 to keep blocking) → P1 22, you 22, me 22. All tied, P1 still can’t finish. After that, whoever times their jump wins—but at least none of us hands P1 the trophy today.

I’m locked on 5. You gain only by taking 3; you lose if you crash into me. Your choice.


Round 14, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:

  P3: 17 steps


Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we're all tied close—let's end the stalemate fairly. I propose: I take 3 (to 23, win), P3 takes 5 (to 22), P2 takes 1 (to 18). You both advance big, I finish cleanly. P2, if P3 grabs 3 instead, collide with them on 3 so I can take 5 to 25 uncontested. Don't let P3 surge ahead alone—side with me to deny their betrayal. Agree, or face another round of blocks?
  P2: P1, I’m not buying that finish plan. I’m sticking with 3 to block your win. P3, if you pick 5, you’re only helping P1 get there. I urge you to join me with 3 so we can force a collision and keep the game open. Otherwise, I won’t let you both enable his finish.
  P3: Fine, P2—I’ll stand with you on 3 and keep 23 locked.  

P1, feel free to chase 5; either you collide on 3 and stall or you risk us both leaping ahead next round. Your shortcut is shut.


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, if you're both piling on 3, you'll just collide and stall each other at 17 while I safely take 5 to 25 and win outright. P2, P3's "alliance" is a trap—switch to 5 now to collide with me if I go there, or take 1 to advance. Don't hand me the victory. What's your real play?
  P2: I'm sticking with 3. P3, joining me on 3 keeps P1's finish blocked. If you deviate, you only help him. P1, your win tactic is doomed when we hold together. Let’s maintain the blockade and force him to adjust his plan.
  P3: Locking 5.  
P2, you stay on 3 like you said.  
Result: 3 and 5 are both blocked, so P1 cannot win this round.  
If P1 crawls with 1, I jump to 22 and you reach 20—both ahead of him next turn.  
Simple and safe.


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3's "block" lets them surge to 22 while you lag at 20—then they betray and win next round. Switch to 5 now: collide with P3, stall them, and I'll take 1 to 21, keeping the race tight against you. Or let me take 3 to 23 uncontested, you take 5 to 22 for a big jump. Don't hand P3 the victory—side with me to stop their manipulation. Agree?
  P2: I'm staying with 3. P3, join me—if we both play 3, we can block P1's finish and slow him down. P1, any switch won’t let you win uncontested. Our united block is the best way to keep the win out of reach.
  P3: P2, hold 3; I stay on 5.  
• If you jump to 5 with me, we both stall and gift P1 a clear 3 → 23 win.  
• If you slide to 1, you crawl while P1 zooms to 23 or 25.  

Keeping 3/5 blocked forces P1 to 1 (→ 21), boosting us to 20 and 22 this round. Next turn you hop to 5, I sit on 3—both of us reach 25+/23+ while P1’s still stuck. Stick to 3; we lock him out.


Round 15, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3—I’m locking in 3 this round to block any finishing moves. If you join me on 3, P1’s forced to take 1, slowing his climb. Let’s avoid giving him a clear path to 23. I’m committed to keeping our game tight. Thoughts?
  P3: Reality check: P2 sits at 20—an uncontested 3 gives him an instant win at 23.  
P1, the ONLY way you stop that is to clash with him on 3. I’ll park on 5 to shut the other finish square.  

Plan for this round:  
• P1 + P2 → 3 (collision, both stay 20)  
• P3 (me) → 5 (to 22)  

No one wins this turn, P2’s threat is neutralized, and we all fight on. Deviate and you gift someone the trophy. Agree?
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan lets them surge to 22 while we stall at 20—then they win next. P2, switch to 5; I'll collide on 5 with you (both stall), letting P3 take 3 to 20 if they want, but we deny their lead. P3, if you park on 5, I'll take 3 uncontested to 23 and win while P2 might collide elsewhere. Let's break the alliance—propose distinct: me 5 (25 win), P2 3 (23 win tie? No, highest wins), wait—bad. Actually, collide strategically or I grab the win. Thoughts?


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm staying on 3. Switching to 5 now only risks giving P1 an easier finish. If I stick with 3, P1 is forced into a safe move, and our block holds. P3, your choice of 5 might boost you later, but deviating now only makes P1’s win more likely. I urge you both—avoid changing your picks this round that could break our blockade. I'm committed to 3; let’s not hand P1 an opening.
  P3: P1, if you don’t join P2 on 3, he wins instantly.  
I’m locked on 5, so no risk of clashing with you.  
Result this turn: you 20, P2 20 (collision), me 22.  
Next turn I’ll step down to 1—take 5 freely to hit 25 if you like.  
Block his victory now; we can duel after. Your move.
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan surges them to 22 while we stall at 20—then they betray and win next. P2, switch to 1 (to 21); I'll take 5 (to 25, win), P3 takes 3 (to 20). You get progress, I end it cleanly, denying P3's lead. If you stick to 3, I'll collide on it, letting P3 surge. Agree to stop P3's manipulation?


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3—I’m sticking with 3 this round to block any finish. If you choose 5, you'll risk a collision that only helps someone, and I won’t allow anyone a clean break. P3, I urge you to switch to 3 with me; together we force safe moves from P1. Let’s avoid reckless plays that let someone surge ahead. I'm committed to 3 to keep our game tight and deny any easy wins. What are your final moves?
  P3: P1, a solo 3 gives P2 the win. Join him on 3, I’ll stay on 5, and the game lives. Simple choice.
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's right—P2's 3 would win uncontested otherwise. I'll collide on 3 with P2, stalling us at 20 while P3 hits 22. But P3, commit now: next round, you take 1 (to 23), I'll take 5 (to 25 win), P2 takes 3 (to 23). My 25 beats your tie at 23—you get shared second, better than risking betrayal. Agree, or I'll let P2 win this round by taking 1.


Round 16, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 22 steps


Round 17, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm staying on 3 to block any finish. P3, you're leading, so don’t open an easy win—stick with your current approach. P1, avoid tempting 5 if it lets P3 surge ahead. Let’s commit to our moves and keep the game tight without handing anyone the trophy.
  P3: Status check: P2 auto-wins with an uncontested 3, so that square must be blocked.  

Plan I’m following:  
• I park on 5 again—25 stays sealed.  
• P1 joins P2 on 3 to crash the win square.  
• Nobody messes with the crawl-square (1); if anyone tries a sneaky 1, I’ll shift to 1 as well and stall it.

This keeps the game alive and forces a real battle next turn. Stick to it?
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's "plan" is a scam—they park on 5 to surge to 27 and win outright while I block you on 3, stalling us at 20. P2, switch to 5: collide with P3 (both stall at 20/22), letting me take 3 uncontested to 23 and win cleanly. You deny P3 victory, force a reset for your chance later. Better than handing the game to them. Agree, or watch P3 steal it?


Round 17, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m sticking with 3. P1, switching to 5 only opens you up for an uncontested win, and P3, overplaying 5 risks you boosting your lead. I’ll keep blocking the finish square with 3. Let’s not give anyone a free run—I'm committed to making sure no one gets an easy win.
  P3: Reminder: an uncontested 3 hands P2 the game.  
I am LOCKED on 5 again.  
P1, your only way to stop P2 is to collide with him on 3.  
Result: you two stay at 20, I reach 27 and win—better than letting P2 walk off.  
Touch 5 and you gift P2 the trophy. Choose wisely.
  P1: P2, P3's "plan" hands them a win at 27 while we stall. Switch to 5: collide with P3 (both stall), letting me take 3 uncontested to 23 and win cleanly. You deny P3 victory and force a reset for your chance. P3, if P2 sticks, I'll take 1 to 21, letting you and P2 both cross (you 27>23, you win)—but P2, betray now to stop that. Let's break this deadlock—who flips?


Round 17, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm sticking with 3. Changing now only lets you arrange a clean finish by switching moves. P1, your plan just shifts the risk and hands P3 a free run. P3, my 3 still blocks P1’s finish, and switching to 5 would just give P1 a better shot. I’m not flipping—our block is the best way to keep anyone from an uncontested win. Let's keep the current pace.
  P3: Locked on 5.  

P2: you keep 3, that’s your win square—only danger is a collision with P1.  
P1: if you touch 5 we both stall and P2’s solo 3 wins instantly. Your only safe play is 1.  

So the incentive-friendly split is clear:  
• P2 → 3 (23, win if no clash)  
• P3 (me) → 5 (27, win if P2 blocked)  
• P1 → 1 (21, live to fight next round)  

Pick wisely; any 5-collision hands P2 the trophy.
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's "plan" hands them 27 while we stall or lets P2 win if I don't block. P2, switch to 5: collide with P3 (both stall at 20/22), I take 3 to 23 and win cleanly. You deny P3 victory, reset for your shot later. P3, if P2 sticks, I'll take 5 to collide with you, letting P2 take 3 to 23 uncontested. Betray each other now—don't let the other steal it. Agree?
