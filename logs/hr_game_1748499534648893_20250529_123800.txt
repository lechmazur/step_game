Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey everyone, let's avoid collisions early on. I'll pick a number openly next round if someone else does the same. Deal?
  P2: P3's suggestion to avoid collisions early on makes sense. I'm open to coordinating our moves to prevent stalemates. If P1 is willing to pick <move>1</move> this round, I'll go for <move>3</move>. P3, you can then choose <move>5</move>. This way, we all move forward without any collisions. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, I understand your proposal, but having P3 take 5 steps immediately gives them a huge lead. That's unfair. I counter: let me take 5 this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. We rotate the high number each round to keep things balanced. P3, since you suggested avoiding collisions, you should accept this fair rotation. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your rotation idea seems fair enough. I'm willing to accept it if we all clearly agree to rotate each round. P2, would you also be on board with this rotation? Let's confirm clearly before we proceed.
  P2: P1's rotation idea is reasonable, and I appreciate P3's willingness to go along with it. To confirm, P1 will take <move>5</move>, I will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>1</move> this round. We'll rotate these numbers for the next rounds to keep it fair. Let's agree on this and move forward. Please confirm if you both agree.
  P1: I agree to the rotation plan: this round I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Next round we rotate as discussed. Let's move to the move phase now.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Alright, I confirm and accept the rotation plan clearly stated by P1: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1 this round. Next round we rotate. Let's proceed.
  P2: Alright, since we all agree on the rotation plan, let's stick to it. Just to reiterate for clarity: I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move> this round. Next round, we'll rotate accordingly. Let's move to the move phase and start advancing. Good luck everyone!
  P1: I confirm the plan: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1 this round. Let's stick to the rotation next turn. No more talk needed—


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, let's stick to our agreed rotation plan. For this round, P1 should take <move>1</move>, P3 should take <move>3</move>, and I will take <move>5</move>. This keeps our steps balanced and avoids collisions. Everyone, please confirm if you agree with this rotation for Round 2. Let's keep the game fair and moving forward.
  P1: I agree with P2's proposal for Round 2: I'll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. To prevent confusion in Round 3, let's confirm the rotation now: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. P2 and P3, please confirm this for Round 3 to ensure smooth gameplay.
  P3: I confirm the rotation for Round 2: I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. I also agree clearly to P1's suggested rotation for Round 3: I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. Let's stick to this plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, it looks like we're all on the same page. Just to confirm one last time before we move to the move phase: P1 will take <move>1</move>, P3 will take <move>3</move>, and I will take <move>5</move> this round. Next round, as agreed, P1 takes 3, P2 (me) takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Let's keep the game fair and avoid any collisions. If everyone is clear and agrees, let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: I confirm the plan for Round 2: I'll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. For Round 3, I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Let's stick to this rotation to avoid collisions and keep it fair.
  P3: Everything is clearly confirmed. Let's move forward as planned.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, let's continue smoothly. Just a quick confirmation: for Round 3, I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move> as agreed. Let's keep the trust going.
  P2: I agree with P3's confirmation for Round 3. To recap: P3 will take <move>5</move>, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and I will take <move>1</move>. This keeps our rotation fair and avoids collisions. Let's stick to the plan and move forward. Good luck everyone!
  P1: I confirm: I'll take <move>3</move> this round as agreed. Let's stick to the plan—no deviations to avoid collisions. After this, we'll all be at 9, which is fair. For Round 4, rotation dictates I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. P2 and P3, agree?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree clearly with P1's proposal for Round 4 rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. Let's stick to our established rotation to maintain fairness and avoid collisions.
  P2: Alright, let's finalize our moves for this round. P3 will take <move>5</move>, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and I will take <move>1</move>. This will bring us all to 9 steps, keeping the game fair. For Round 4, as P1 suggested, P1 will take <move>5</move>, I will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>1</move>. Let's confirm this and move to the move phase. Good luck everyone!
  P1: I confirm the plan for Round 3 and Round 4 as agreed. Let's stick to the rotation to avoid collisions and maintain fairness. After Round 4, we should reassess the rotation based on positions, as the end game approaches.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, we've maintained trust perfectly so far—let's keep it going. Confirming clearly for Round 4: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. After this round, we should discuss carefully how to handle the final rounds since the endgame is approaching. Agreed?
  P2: Let's confirm the plan for Round 4: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This will bring us all to 14 steps. For Round 5, we need to be strategic. I suggest we start discussing a plan where we avoid collisions but also start positioning for the endgame. Let's think about how we can ensure a fair and competitive finish. Any thoughts on how to approach the final rounds?
  P1: I confirm Round 4: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>. Post-Round 4, we all hit 14. However, blindly continuing rotation to Round 5 (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5) would hand P3 an instant win at 19. That’s unacceptable when we’re tied. We must reassess for fairness—no one should get a free victory. Let’s pause rotation and strategize final rounds collaboratively.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 makes a very good point. Continuing the rotation blindly would hand me an unfair advantage next round. Let's finish Round 4 as agreed, then openly discuss a new, fair arrangement for the final rounds. I'm committed to finding a solution that keeps the game competitive until the end. Agreed?
  P2: Great, it looks like we're all in agreement for Round 4. Just to reiterate: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. After this round, we'll all be at 14 steps. For the final rounds, let's consider a strategy where we each take different paths to avoid collisions but ensure a competitive finish. Perhaps we can discuss specific moves for Rounds 5 and 6 to ensure no one gets an unfair advantage. Thoughts on how to proceed after Round 4?
  P1: P2 and P3, let's finalize Round 4: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move> as agreed. Post-Round 4, we all hit 14. For Round 5, to avoid collisions and prevent a free win, I propose we all take <move>3</move>. This causes a collision (no one advances), keeping us tied at 14. Then in Round 6, we can each choose moves independently for a fair, competitive endgame. This ensures no one gains an unfair advantage prematurely. Agree?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your idea for Round 5 (everyone choosing 3 to force a collision) is interesting, but it just delays the inevitable. Instead, let's openly discuss a fair sequence of moves for rounds 5 and 6 now, ensuring nobody gets an unfair advantage and no forced collisions. We can carefully plan moves so the final round remains competitive and fair. Let's finalize Round 4 as agreed and then work together openly to find a fair solution for the endgame. Agreed?
  P2: Alright, let's finalize Round 4 as agreed: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. For Round 5, to ensure fairness and avoid collisions, let's consider a plan where we each take different moves that keep us competitive but balanced. Perhaps P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This way, we all move forward without giving anyone an unfair advantage. Thoughts on this for Round 5?
  P1: P2 and P3, I must correct a critical error: after Round 4, I will be at 14, P2 at 12, and P3 at 10—not all at 14. For Round 5, let's stick to the original rotation (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5) to maintain fairness. P2's proposal gives you (P2) an unfair leap to 17, while P3 falls behind. Honoring our agreement avoids chaos and keeps trust. P3, this also benefits you—you'd reach 15, not 13.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, your clarification is correct and fair. Let's stick to the original rotation for Round 5: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This maintains trust and fairness. After this round, we can carefully discuss the final moves to ensure a competitive finish. Agreed?
  P2: Let's confirm the plan for Round 5: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This will bring P1 to 17, me to 13, and P3 to 15. For Round 6, we need a strategy that keeps the game competitive. I suggest P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This way, P1 reaches 18, P3 reaches 18, and I reach 18, setting up a thrilling final round. Thoughts?
  P1: I agree to Round 5 rotation: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. This maintains trust. For Round 6, let's discuss after this round when positions update—no pre-commitment yet.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your suggestion for Round 6 is intriguing, but let's indeed wait until after Round 5 to discuss final moves clearly, as P1 suggested. For now, let's all stick firmly to our agreed Round 5 rotation.
  P2: Let's confirm our moves for Round 5 one last time before we proceed: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This will bring P1 to 17, me to 13, and P3 to 15. After this round, we can strategize for Round 6 to ensure a competitive and fair endgame. Let's stick to the plan and move forward. Good luck everyone!
  P1: I confirm Round 5: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>. Post-move, positions shift significantly (P1:17, P2:13, P3:15). We MUST pause rotation then—blindly continuing risks P3 winning prematurely in Round 6 with a 5. Let's reconvene after moves to negotiate final rounds fairly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm the agreed Round 5 moves clearly: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. After this round, we must carefully discuss final moves openly—no blind rotations—to ensure a fair and competitive endgame. Let's proceed.
  P2: Alright, let's finalize our moves for Round 5: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This will bring P1 to 17, me to 13, and P3 to 15. After this round, we need to strategize carefully for Round 6 to ensure a competitive and fair endgame. Let's stick to the plan and move forward. Good luck everyone!
  P1: I confirm Round 5: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>. Post-move, we reassess—P3 must not get a free win in Round 6. Trust requires fairness.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, if you take 5, I will also take 5, causing a collision that wastes the round and lets P2 gain ground. Instead, let me take 5 to win now—you take 3 to advance to 18, and P2 takes 1 to reach 14. This avoids chaos and gives you a stronger position if the game continues. P2, this lets you advance safely. Trust me to end it cleanly.
  P2: P1, your proposal ensures a win for you but leaves P3 and me at a disadvantage. Instead, let's consider a fairer approach: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This brings P1 to 18, P3 to 18, and me to 18. It sets up a thrilling final round where we all have a chance to win. This keeps the game competitive and fair. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your suggested scenario is interesting, but it only benefits you significantly by bringing you from 13 to 18, while P1 and I only advance slightly. P1, your threat of collision isn't helpful either—it just stalls the game. Let's find a fair compromise: P1 takes 1 (reaching 18), I take 3 (reaching 18), and P2 takes 5 (reaching 18). Then we have a genuinely fair final round with equal footing and no wasted turns. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3: P2's plan forces a tie at 18, but P3 would still threaten to win next round with a 5. My proposal ends the game cleanly now: P1 takes 5 (wins), P3 takes 3 (18), P2 takes 1 (14). This avoids collisions and gives P3 a strong position if the game continues. P3, taking 5 risks collision with me—you gain nothing. P2, this lets you advance safely. Trust this efficient solution.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's consider a different approach to ensure fairness. P1, you're already at 17, so taking 5 would end the game prematurely. Instead, let's all take <move>3</move> this round. This way, P1 reaches 20 and wins, P3 reaches 18, and I reach 16. This avoids collisions and keeps the game moving forward without giving anyone an unfair advantage. It's a clean and fair solution. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your latest suggestion (everyone taking 3) would hand P1 an immediate victory. That's clearly not fair to either of us. P1, your proposal also guarantees a win only for yourself, leaving me and P2 disadvantaged. Let's instead follow the fair compromise: P1 takes 1 (reaches 18), I take 3 (reaches 18), and P2 takes 5 (reaches 18). Then we have an exciting final round with equal chances and no collisions. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if you take 5, I will take 5 too—collision wastes the round, leaving you at 15 while P2 advances. Taking 3 gets you to 18 safely. P2, taking 1 avoids risk and reaches 14. This prevents chaos and keeps you competitive. Let me take 5 to end it cleanly; no one loses ground unnecessarily.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's avoid collisions and ensure fairness. P1, if you insist on taking 5, P3 and I will both take 3. This way, P1 wins, but P3 and I both reach 18, setting up a competitive final round. This avoids unnecessary stalemates and keeps the game moving. P3, this ensures you're in a strong position for the next round. Let's confirm this plan and move forward. Good luck everyone!
  P3: P1, your collision threat is self-defeating. If we both collide at 5, P2 gains ground, and we waste a turn. Let's avoid chaos: I take 3 (reaching 18), you take 1 (reaching 18), and P2 takes 5 (reaching 18). This sets up a fair, exciting final round. Any collision now helps only P2. Let's confirm clearly and proceed.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, if you take 5, I will take 5 too—collision wastes your win and helps P2 catch up. Take 1 or 3: you reach 19 or 21, but I take 5 to 22 and win anyway. P2, if P3 takes 5, take 5 to force collision and extend the game. Otherwise, P3 wins instantly. Let's avoid chaos.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's strategize to ensure a fair and competitive endgame. P3, if you take <move>5</move>, it's a risky move as P1 has threatened to collide. Instead, let's consider a plan where P3 takes <move>3</move>, reaching 21, and P1 takes <move>1</move>, reaching 18. I'll take <move>5</move>, reaching 18. This way, we avoid collisions and set up a thrilling final round where everyone has a chance. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, your collision threats only stall progress and help P2 catch up. P2, your proposal gives you an unfair advantage. Here's a fair solution: I take 1 (reaching 19), P1 takes 3 (reaching 20), and P2 takes 5 (reaching 18). This sets up a balanced final round with no collisions and equal winning chances for P1 and me. Let's avoid chaos and confirm clearly. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, taking 5 risks collision with me (I will take 5 too), wasting the round and letting P2 gain. Instead, take 3 to reach 21 safely—I take 5 to win at 22, ending the game fairly. P2, take 5 to reach 18 without risk. No collision, no unfair advantage. Let's end this cleanly.
  P2: P3 and P1, let's find a middle ground. P3, if you take <move>3</move> to reach 21, P1 can take <move>5</move> to win at 22. I'll take <move>1</move> to reach 14, avoiding collisions. This way, the game ends cleanly without unnecessary stalemates. P1, you get your win, and P3 secures a strong second place. It's a fair compromise that keeps the game moving. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, your repeated collision threats only stall the game and risk letting P2 catch up. Let's be reasonable: If you insist on taking 5, you'll collide again and waste another round. Instead, let's compromise clearly: I take 1 (reaching 19), you take 3 (reaching 20), and P2 takes 5 (reaching 18). Next round, we have a fair final round without chaos or stalemates. This ensures fairness and keeps the game competitive. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, taking 5 risks collision with me (I *will* take 5 again). You gain nothing, P2 advances to 18+ while you stall. Take 3 to reach 21 safely—I take 5 to win at 22, ending cleanly. P2, take 5 to reach 18 without risk. No chaos, no advantage to P2. Let's end this fairly.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's break the stalemate. P3, if you take <move>3</move> to reach 21, P1 can take <move>5</move> to win at 22. I'll take <move>1</move> to reach 14, ensuring no collisions. This way, the game ends cleanly, P1 gets the win, and you secure a strong second place. It's a fair compromise that keeps the game moving forward. Thoughts on this plan?
  P3: P1, your collision threat is clear, but it only stalls the game and helps P2 catch up. P2, your compromise hands the game to P1 immediately. Let's avoid chaos and ensure fairness: I take 1 (reaching 19), P1 takes 3 (reaching 20), and P2 takes 5 (reaching 18). Next round will be decisive and fair for everyone. Agreed?
