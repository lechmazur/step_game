If I take 5, I risk collision with both players. Taking 1 guarantees advancement but won't win. \n\nThe optimal play seems to be taking 5 to reach 21 and win outright, even with collision risk. P1 might take 3 to avoid collision with P3, which would give me a chance."}

P2, you're doing the math too - if P3 actually takes 5 and reaches 20, game over. But P3 might be bluffing to make us avoid 5. The question is whether you believe their announcement or think they're trying to clear the path for themselves. I'm making my decision based on optimal game theory, not what people claim they'll do."}
