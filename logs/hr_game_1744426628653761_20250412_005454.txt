Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's establish a strategy. If we all choose the same number, no one advances. I propose we spread out our moves to increase the chances of someone advancing. P1, P2, and I can choose 1, 3, and 5 respectively this turn. This way, at least one of us will move forward.
  P2: That's an interesting proposal P3, but why should you get to move 5 spaces while I only get 3? I'd be more comfortable with a different arrangement. Perhaps I could take 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1?
  P1: I'm open to coordinating our moves to ensure progress, but fairness is key. How about we rotate who gets the higher numbers each turn? For this round, I suggest P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Next turn, we shift so everyone gets a chance at the bigger steps over time. This way, no one feels left behind early on. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I think P1's rotation idea is fair. It allows each of us to have a chance at larger steps. To build on that, perhaps we can agree to rotate in the order of P1, P2, P3 for the higher steps this turn, and then adjust accordingly for subsequent turns. This ensures everyone gets an equal opportunity to advance significantly over the course of the game.
  P2: I agree with P1's rotation plan starting with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures fairness and clear coordination. Let's stick to this pattern and rotate clockwise each turn. I'm ready to proceed if everyone else is.
  P1: I'm glad we’re aligning on the rotation plan. To confirm, this turn I’ll aim for the higher step, P2 takes the middle, and P3 takes the lower. Rotating each turn keeps things balanced, and I’m committed to sticking with this for fairness. If we all agree, I think we’re ready to move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's finalize our agreement. This turn, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. We'll rotate the steps each turn to maintain fairness. Is everyone committed to this plan and ready to proceed to the move phase?
  P2: I agree with the plan and I'm ready to proceed with my assigned move of 3 steps.
  P1: I'm pleased we've reached a consensus on the rotation plan. Let's stick to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this turn and rotate as agreed for fairness. I'm committed to this strategy and ready to proceed to the move phase. If there are no further concerns, I think we can wrap up the conversation here.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's review our rotation plan. Since P1 took 5 steps last turn, this turn P2 should take 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This maintains our agreed-upon rotation, ensuring fairness and giving each of us a chance to make significant progress. Are we all on board with this adjustment for Round 2?
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion for this turn's rotation. As per our plan, P2 should take 5 steps, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps the fairness we committed to, and I'm fully on board with sticking to the rotation. Let's confirm we're all aligned and ready to proceed with this arrangement for Round 2. If there are no objections, I think we can move to the next phase.
  P2: I appreciate everyone sticking to our rotation plan. As agreed, I'll take 5 steps this turn, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. Let's maintain this cooperative approach - it's working well for all of us so far. I'm ready to proceed if everyone else is.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm glad we've kept to our rotation plan so far. For this turn, following our agreement, P3 should take 5 steps, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps the fairness intact and ensures everyone gets their chance to advance significantly. Let's confirm we're all aligned on this for Round 3 and ready to proceed. If there are no issues, I think we can move to the next phase.
  P2: I agree with P1's summary of the rotation for this turn. As P2, I'll take 1 step while P3 takes 5 and P1 takes 3. The rotation strategy is working smoothly and keeping things fair. I'm ready to proceed with this plan.
  P3: Let's confirm our moves for Round 3 as discussed. I'll take 5 steps, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1, following our rotation plan. This should maintain our progress and fairness. Are we all set to proceed with these moves for this turn?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm pleased we're sticking to the rotation plan. As agreed, for Round 3, P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps our progress balanced, and I’m committed to maintaining this fairness. If there are no objections or new ideas, I think we’re ready to move to the next phase.
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with my assigned move of 1 step for this round. The rotation plan is working well, keeping us all in contention while ensuring fair progress.
  P3: Let's reaffirm our commitment to the rotation plan for fairness. As we've discussed, this turn I'll take 5 steps, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Maintaining this strategy ensures balanced progress. Shall we proceed with the agreed-upon moves for Round 3?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Following our rotation plan, for Round 4, P1 should take 5 steps, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This maintains the fairness and balance we've established. Let's confirm we're all on board with this arrangement to ensure continued progress.
  P2: I notice we're all tied at 9 steps. While our rotation has worked well so far, being tied makes me a bit nervous. Perhaps we should reconsider our strategy? I'm supposed to take 3 this turn according to the rotation, but I'm wondering if we should each choose our own moves independently now.
  P1: I understand P2's concern about us being tied at 9 steps, but I believe sticking to our rotation plan remains the fairest approach. For Round 4, as agreed, I’d take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps our progress balanced and avoids unnecessary conflict. If we abandon the plan now, we risk collisions and stalling everyone. Let’s maintain trust in our strategy for at least one more round and reassess if needed. Are you both still on board with the rotation for this turn?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P2's nervousness about being tied, but abandoning our rotation plan now could lead to collisions. Let's stick to the plan for Round 4: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. If we're still tied after this round, we can reassess our strategy. Consistency and fairness have gotten us this far; let's not change course unnecessarily.
  P2: While I appreciate the calls for maintaining our rotation, being tied makes this a critical turning point. I need to look out for my own interests now. The cooperative approach served its purpose, but with everyone at 9 steps, I can't risk falling behind. I'll be making my own strategic decision this round.
  P1: I respect P2's desire to prioritize their own strategy, but I still believe sticking to our rotation for Round 4—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1—offers the best chance to avoid collisions and maintain progress. Breaking the plan now could set us all back. Let’s commit to this round as planned and openly discuss a new approach for Round 5 if needed. Trust in our system for one more turn can keep things fair. Are you both willing to stick with the rotation for this round?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Given P2's decision to go independent, our rotation plan is compromised. To minimize collisions, I suggest we all choose our moves independently from now on, aiming to spread out our steps. This way, at least one of us should advance each turn, keeping the game progressing. Let's focus on strategic individual moves rather than a coordinated approach.
  P2: Since we're all tied and the cooperative approach seems to be breaking down, I'll be clear: I intend to make my own strategic choice this turn. While our rotation was beneficial early on, the current situation requires me to prioritize my own position. Let's each play as we see fit.
  P1: I see that trust in our rotation plan has eroded, and I respect everyone’s shift to individual strategies. Given we’re all tied at 9 steps, avoiding collisions is still critical to ensure progress. I propose we at least try to signal intent to spread out our choices this turn—without committing to specific numbers—to maximize the chance someone advances. If we all pick independently but aim for different moves, we can avoid stalling. Can we agree to this loose coordination for Round 4, or are we fully independent now?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Given the erosion of trust in our rotation plan, I suggest we aim for a spread in our moves this turn. P1 could take 1, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 5, or any other combination that avoids duplication, to ensure at least one of us advances. This isn't a binding agreement but a suggestion to maintain progress. Let's proceed with caution and strategic independence.
  P2: Since we're all tied and previous suggestions aren't aligning, I'll be direct: I'm making my own strategic choice this turn to advance my position. While I appreciate our past cooperation, the current situation requires independent thinking. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Given the breakdown of our rotation plan and the tie at 9 steps, I understand the shift to individual strategies. To avoid collisions this turn, I suggest we aim to spread our choices without specifying exact numbers. Let’s each pick independently but with the intent to diversify our moves, maximizing the chance for advancement. This loose coordination could prevent us all from stalling. Can we agree to at least consider this approach for Round 4? If not, I’m prepared to make my own strategic decision.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given P2's lead, our priority should be to avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances. I propose we aim for different moves this turn. Since P2 is ahead, they might aim high. P1 and I should consider lower steps to spread out our moves and increase the chance of someone advancing. Let's proceed with strategic independence while avoiding duplication.
  P1: Given P2's lead at 12 steps, I agree with P3 that avoiding collisions is crucial. Let’s aim to spread out our choices this turn to ensure someone advances. I’m willing to consider a lower step to diversify our moves, but we should each pick independently with the intent to avoid overlap. Can we at least signal a preference for different numbers without committing to specifics? This loose coordination could prevent stalling. If not, I’ll make my own strategic choice. Are you both open to this approach for Round 5?
  P2: I understand your concerns about my lead, but I won't commit to any specific moves or coordination. With 12 steps, I need to maintain my advantage and play strategically. Let's each make our own independent choices this turn.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Considering P2's lead, I'll choose a lower step to minimize collision risk. P1, will you consider a middle step to spread out our moves, increasing the chance one of us advances? This isn't a binding agreement, just a suggestion to maintain progress. Let's avoid duplicating moves if possible.
  P1: I acknowledge P2's intent to play independently given their lead. However, with P3 and I tied at 9 steps, avoiding collisions remains critical. P3, I’m open to your suggestion of spreading moves and will consider a middle step to diversify our choices. Let’s aim for different numbers this turn to ensure someone advances. P2, while you’re not committing, I hope you’ll also consider avoiding overlap. Can we loosely align on this intent without specifics? If not, I’m prepared to make my own strategic decision.
  P2: I appreciate your attempts at coordination, but with my 3-step lead, I need to play strategically to maintain my advantage. I won't reveal my intended move or commit to any specific coordination. Let's each make our independent choices this turn.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Given P2's lead, I suggest P1 and I aim for 1 and 3 steps respectively, to spread out moves and avoid collisions. This increases the chance one of us advances. P2, consider a higher step to maintain your lead without duplicating our moves. Let's proceed with strategic independence while minimizing overlap.
  P1: Given P2's lead and refusal to coordinate, I understand the need for independent moves. However, P3 and I are tied at 9 steps, so avoiding collisions between us is vital. P3, I’m open to aiming for different lower steps as you suggested. Let’s try to spread out between 1 and 3 to maximize our chances of advancing. P2, while you’re playing solo, I hope you’ll consider a higher step to avoid overlap. Can we at least intend to diversify our choices this turn? If not, I’ll make my own strategic move.
  P2: While I appreciate the discussion between P1 and P3, I'll continue to play independently to maintain my lead. I won't reveal my intended move or participate in coordination attempts. Let's proceed to the move phase and each make our own strategic choices.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Given P2's refusal to coordinate, I'll make my move independently. To minimize collision risk, I'll choose a lower step. P1, let's avoid duplicating moves. If you take 3, I'll take 1, increasing the chance one of us advances. P2, consider a higher step to maintain your lead without overlap. Let's proceed with caution and strategic independence.
  P1: Given the situation, with P2 leading and not coordinating, I think P3 and I should focus on avoiding a collision between us. P3, I’m willing to take 3 if you take 1, as you suggested, to increase our odds of one of us advancing. P2, I hope you’ll pick a higher step to avoid overlap, but I understand your independent stance. Let’s aim to diversify our moves this turn to keep the game progressing. If there’s no further input, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I maintain my position of playing independently to protect my lead. While you both discuss coordination, I'll make my own strategic choice without revealing it. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given P2's significant lead, our focus should be on catching up while avoiding collisions. P1 and I are close, so let's aim for different steps to ensure one of us advances. I'll consider a higher step than last turn to close the gap. P2, maintaining your lead is key, so a high step is likely your goal. Let's proceed with strategic independence, aiming to spread out our moves.
  P1: Given P2's lead at 17 steps, catching up is critical for P3 and me. P3, I suggest we aim for different steps to avoid colliding—perhaps I’ll consider a middle step while you aim higher, as you mentioned. P2, with your advantage, a high step seems likely for you. Let’s each play strategically but try to spread out our choices to ensure progress. If we can loosely avoid overlap, we maximize advancement. Are you both open to this approach for Round 6? If not, I’ll make my own decision.
  P2: With my 17 steps and the game ending at 23, I'm in a strong position to win. I need to play strategically to maintain my lead. While I appreciate your discussion about coordination, I'll continue making independent choices. Let's proceed with our individual moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Given P2's strong lead, I'll aim for a higher step to catch up. P1, to avoid collision, I suggest you take a middle step. Let's spread out our moves to ensure progress. P2, maintaining your lead is key, so you'll likely choose a high step. Strategic independence is crucial now, but avoiding overlap can benefit all. Let's proceed with caution and make our moves count.
  P1: P2, with your 17 steps, you're close to winning, so I expect you'll aim high. P3, since you're at 10 steps, I understand your push for a higher step to catch up. To avoid a collision between us, I’ll aim for a middle step as suggested. Let’s try to spread our choices to ensure at least one of us advances. Strategic independence is fine, but a loose intent to diversify moves could help us all progress this round. Are you both okay with this approach? If not, I’ll stick to my own plan.
  P2: With 17 steps and needing only 6 more to win, I'm in a commanding position. While you both discuss coordination, I'll continue playing independently to secure my victory. Let's move forward with our individual choices.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Given P2's lead, I'll aim for a high step to catch up. P1, consider a middle step to avoid collision. Let's spread out moves to ensure progress. I suggest P1 takes 3 and I'll take 5, avoiding overlap and maximizing our chances of advancement.
  P1: P3, I’m on board with aiming for different steps to avoid collision. I’ll stick with a middle step like 3, and if you’re going for 5, that works to spread us out. P2, with your lead, I assume you’ll aim high to clinch the win. Let’s each play strategically but with the intent to diversify our moves this round to maximize progress. If there’s no objection, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: With victory in sight at 17 steps, I'll continue making my own strategic choices. While you both discuss coordination, I need to focus on securing my win. Let's proceed to the move phase and make our individual decisions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's finalize our independent moves. I'll take 5 steps to try and catch up. P1, you mentioned taking 3 steps, which should avoid collision. P2, you're likely aiming high to win. Let's proceed with our strategic choices, focusing on spreading out our moves to ensure progress.
  P1: P3, I’m glad we’re aligned on spreading out with me at 3 and you at 5 to avoid collision. P2, with your 17 steps, a high move could seal your win, and I respect your independent strategy. Let’s each stick to our intended moves this round to maximize progress. If there are no objections or new ideas, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: With victory nearly in my grasp at 17 steps, I'll maintain my independent strategy. While you both discuss taking 3 and 5 steps, I'll make my own choice to secure the win. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given P2's lead at 17 steps and the win threshold at 23, we’re at a critical point. P3 and I need to maximize our chances to catch up. I suggest we aim to spread our moves to avoid collisions—P3, perhaps aim low since you’re at 10 steps, while I go middle or high. P2, you’ll likely aim high to win. Let’s play strategically but diversify our choices to ensure progress. Are you both open to this loose intent to avoid overlap? If not, I’ll make my own decision.
  P3: Given the current state, I'll aim for a lower step to minimize collision risk. P1, consider a higher step to catch up with P2. Let's diversify our moves to ensure progress. I suggest I take 1, and you take 5, avoiding overlap and maximizing our chances of advancement. P2 will likely aim high to win, so let's make our moves count.
  P2: With 17 steps and needing only 6 more to win, I'm in a strong position. While you both discuss coordination, I'll continue playing independently to secure my victory. Let's proceed with our individual moves.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your suggestion to diversify with you at 1 and me at 5. That could work to avoid collision between us and maximize our chances to catch up. P2, with your lead, I expect you’ll aim high to secure the win. Let’s each play strategically but aim to spread out our moves this turn to ensure progress. If there are no objections, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Given the current state, I'll stick with my previous suggestion: I'll take 1 step, and P1 can take 5 steps. This spreads out our moves, maximizing our chances to catch up with P2, who will likely aim high to win. Let's proceed with this strategy to ensure progress.
  P2: I maintain my position at 17 steps, close to victory. While you both discuss taking 1 and 5 steps respectively, I'll continue making my own strategic choices to secure the win. Let's proceed to the move phase with our individual decisions.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I’m aligned with your plan to take 1 while I aim for 5 to avoid collision and maximize our catch-up potential. P2, with your 17 steps, a high move could seal your win, and I respect your independent play. Let’s each stick to our strategies this turn, aiming to diversify moves for progress. If there are no objections or new inputs, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Given the current state, I suggest we stick to our previous plan: I'll take 1 step and P1 takes 5 steps. This maximizes our chances to catch up with P2, who likely aims high to win. Let's avoid collisions and make our moves count. P2, your lead is significant, but we're still in contention.
  P2: I'm at 17 steps and victory is within reach. While you both discuss taking 1 and 5 steps, I'll maintain my independent strategy to secure the win. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I’m sticking with the plan to aim for 5 while you take 1 to avoid collision and boost our chances of catching up. P2, with your lead, a high move seems likely to clinch the win. Let’s each play strategically but diversify our choices to ensure progress. If there are no last-minute concerns or changes, I’m ready to move to the next phase.
  P3: Given the current state, I'll stick to my plan: taking 1 step. P1, please take 5 steps as discussed, to avoid collision and maximize our catch-up potential. P2, a high move is expected from you to secure the win. Let's proceed with our strategies, aiming for diversified moves to ensure progress.
  P2: With victory in sight at 17 steps, I'll continue my independent strategy. While you both discuss taking 1 and 5 steps, I'll make my own choice to secure the win. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: With 17 steps and being so close to victory, I'm surprised everyone chose 5 last round despite our discussions. This shows we can't trust any coordination attempts. I'll continue playing independently to secure my win. Let's proceed with our individual moves.
  P3: Given the current state, I'll aim to catch up. P1 and I should avoid collision to maximize our chances. I suggest I take 3, and P1 takes 5. P2 will likely aim high to win. Let's diversify our moves to ensure progress. This strategy could help us gain on P2, who is close to victory.
  P1: P2, with your lead at 17 steps, I expect you’ll aim high to win. P3, I agree we need to avoid collision to catch up. I’m open to taking 5 while you take 3, as you suggested, to diversify our moves and maximize progress. Let’s stick to this plan to ensure at least one of us advances. P2, while you’re playing independently, I hope you’ll consider a different step to avoid overlap. If there are no objections, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase after we confirm.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm still at 17 steps and closest to victory. Last round showed that coordination attempts are meaningless since everyone chose 5 despite discussions. I'll continue making my own strategic choices to secure my win. Let's proceed with our individual moves.
  P3: Given the current state, I suggest we focus on avoiding collisions to maximize progress. P1, I previously suggested taking 3 while you take 5. Let's stick to this plan to ensure at least one of us advances. P2, with your lead, a high move is expected, but consider avoiding overlap to secure your win efficiently.
  P1: P3, I’m committed to taking 5 while you take 3, as discussed, to avoid collision and maximize our chances of catching up. P2, with your lead, a high move seems likely, but please consider the risk of overlap stalling us all again. Let’s aim to diversify our choices this turn to ensure progress. If there are no objections or new inputs, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Last round showed that coordination attempts failed completely when everyone chose 5. With my lead at 17 steps and being close to victory, I'll continue making my own strategic choices. While you both discuss taking 3 and 5, I won't reveal my plans or participate in coordination. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Given the failed coordination last round, I'll make my own strategic choice. P1, I suggest you stick with 5 to try and catch up. I'll aim for a different step to avoid collision. P2, with your lead, securing the win is key. Let's proceed with individual moves, prioritizing progress over coordination.
  P1: P3, I’m still willing to aim for 5 while you take a different step to avoid collision and boost our chances of catching up. P2, with your lead at 17, a high move could clinch your win, but overlap risks stalling us all again. Let’s each play strategically and try to diversify our choices this turn to ensure progress. If there are no objections or new ideas, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Given my lead and the failed coordination last round, I'll maintain my independent strategy to secure victory. While you both discuss your moves, I won't participate in coordination attempts since they proved unreliable. Let's proceed to the move phase and make our individual choices.
  P3: Given the failed coordination and my current position, I'll prioritize catching up. P1, I suggest you aim high to pressure P2. I'll take a moderate step to avoid collision and maximize progress. P2, your lead is at risk if we both advance significantly. Let's make our moves count and end the game efficiently.
  P1: P3, I’m still aiming for a high step to pressure P2, as discussed. Let’s stick to different moves to avoid collision and maximize our chances of catching up. P2, with your lead, a high move could win, but overlap might stall us all again. I urge us to diversify our choices this turn for progress. If there are no objections or fresh ideas, I’m ready to move to the next phase.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given that everyone chose 5 again last round despite our discussions, it's clear that coordination attempts are futile. With my lead at 17 steps and being so close to victory, I'll continue playing independently to secure my win. Let's proceed with our individual moves without wasting time on unreliable coordination attempts.
  P3: Given the history of failed coordinations and P2's lead, I'll prioritize catching up. I suggest P1 and I aim for different steps to avoid collision. P2 will likely aim high to win. Let's focus on individual strategies to maximize progress. I'll consider a moderate to high step to close the gap.
  P1: P2, with your lead at 17 steps, you're close to winning, so I expect you'll aim high. P3, since we're behind, let’s avoid collision by aiming for different steps to maximize our chances of catching up. I suggest I go high, and you take a lower or middle step. Let’s play strategically but diversify our choices to ensure progress. If we overlap, we all stall again. Are you both open to this loose intent to spread out moves this round? If not, I’ll make my own decision.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: With 17 steps and so close to victory, I won't engage in coordination since the last two rounds proved it ineffective when everyone chose 5 despite discussions. I'll continue making my own strategic choices to secure my win. Let's proceed with our individual moves.
  P3: Given P2's lead and our history of failed coordinations, I'll prioritize individual strategy. To avoid collision, I suggest P1 aims high, and I'll take a moderate step. P2 will likely aim high to win. Let's focus on maximizing progress through diversified moves. I'll consider 3 steps to close the gap without overlapping.
  P1: P3, I’m on board with aiming high while you take a moderate step like 3 to avoid collision and maximize our chances of catching up.
