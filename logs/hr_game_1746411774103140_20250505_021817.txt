Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 (me) takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This way, we all move forward without any conflicts. What do you think?
  P1: P2’s split is sensible, but I’ve got a tweak: P3, would you take 1 this turn? Then P2 sticks with 3 and I take 5—no collisions and we all advance. P3, can I count on you for 1?
  P3: Let’s keep it simple—how about I take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>? That way, no one’s stuck with the slowest move, and we all get a fair start. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Alright, let's find a middle ground. How about P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>? This seems fair and keeps us all moving. Let's confirm and move on.
  P1: I propose a fair rotation over the first three turns so everyone stays equal and we avoid collisions:

• Turn 1: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1  
• Turn 2: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3  
• Turn 3: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5  

Each of us gets a 1, 3, and 5 exactly once. Agreed?
  P3: I like the rotation idea, P1. It’s balanced and fair, and no one gets stuck with 1 every time. I’m on board with Turn 1: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let’s stick to it and build trust early. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1's rotation plan seems solid and fair. It ensures we all move at different paces each turn, minimizing conflicts. I agree with P3; let's go with the rotation plan starting with Turn 1: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This way, we build trust and keep the game moving smoothly. Everyone on board?
  P1: Agreed—let’s follow the rotation for Turn 1: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P3: Great—we’re all aligned on Turn 1: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let’s stick to it and build trust early. Looking forward to seeing us all advance cleanly. Ready to move?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Looks like I messed up the rotation plan—apologies for that. Let's realign and stick to the agreed rotation moving forward. For Turn 2, that means: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. I’ll take <move>3</move> this time as promised. Can we all commit to this and rebuild trust?
  P1: I see P2’s lead—let’s balance things this turn. Proposal for Round 2: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. Unique picks, no collisions, everyone advances and P1 catches up. Agreed?
  P2: P1, I appreciate your attempt to balance, but sticking to our original rotation plan is crucial for building trust. Let's follow the agreed plan for Turn 2: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This way, we avoid confusion and keep the game fair. P3, are you on board with taking <move>3</move>? Let's confirm and move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand the hesitation after last round, and I take full responsibility. This time, I’m fully committed to the original rotation: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let’s prove we can trust each other and get back on track. I’ll take <move>3</move> as agreed. Ready to move forward cleanly?
  P1: Rotation now leaves me too far behind. Let’s do: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.  
• P3 still gets 3 as promised  
• P2 advances (to 4) so you stay competitive  
• I close the gap (to 5) and keep the game tight  

All unique, no collisions. Agreed?
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about falling behind, but changing the plan now might lead to more confusion. Sticking to the rotation plan ensures fairness and builds trust. Let's follow the agreed plan for Turn 2: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This way, we all move forward without collisions. P3 has committed to <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. P1, please consider taking <move>1</move> to keep the game balanced. Let's confirm and move on.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I get that you're behind, but sticking to the agreed rotation this round is key to restoring trust after my mistake. If we all follow through—P1=1, P2=5, P3=3—we prove we can cooperate and avoid chaos. Let's reset the trust meter now, then we can revisit balance next round. Agreed?
  P1: P3—you and I are both at 0, P2’s at 3. Let’s team up: this turn I take 5, you take 1, and P2 takes 3. We both advance while P2 stays at 3. Next round we can alternate fairly between us. What do you say—are you with me?
  P2: P3, P1 is trying to manipulate the situation to his advantage. Sticking to our rotation plan is the only way to ensure fairness and build trust. If we deviate now, we'll fall into a cycle of mistrust and chaos. Let's stay with the plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This way, we all move forward without collisions. P3, you've committed to <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. P1, please reconsider and take <move>1</move>. Let's confirm and move on.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I hear your pitch, but I’m sticking with <move>3</move> this round as promised. We all benefit from predictability and trust—let’s not spiral into chaos. P2 and I are aligned; if you also follow through with <move>1</move>, we all advance cleanly. Let’s lock it in and move forward.
  P1: Understood—I'll take <move>1> this turn. Let’s all advance cleanly and rebuild trust.
  P2: Great, we're all aligned for Turn 2: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let's stick to the plan and move forward. Trust is key, and this will set a good precedent for future rounds. Let's confirm one last time and proceed to the move phase. Everyone ready?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you broke the agreement again after we all committed to the rotation. That’s two rounds in a row where trust was violated. P2 and I advanced cleanly because we stuck to the plan. For Turn 3, the original rotation says: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. I’ll take <move>5</move> as agreed—P2, can you confirm <move>1</move>? P1, if you want to rebuild any trust, take <move>3</move> this time. Let’s see if we can still salvage cooperation.
  P1: I propose Turn 3 picks of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Unique choices, no collisions, and we all advance: I go to 5, P2 to 6, P3 to 4. P2 keeps the lead, P3 stays competitive, and I close the gap. Let’s cleanly move forward—who’s in?
  P2: P1, your repeated attempts to change the plan are causing chaos. We need to stick to the rotation to maintain trust. P3 and I have both advanced by following the plan. For Turn 3, let's follow the original rotation: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. P3 has committed to <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. P1, please take <move>3</move> to rebuild trust. Let's confirm and move forward. Sticking to the plan is the only way to ensure fairness and cooperation. Everyone ready?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you’re still at 0 because of your own choices. P2 and I advanced by honoring the plan. I’m locked in for <move>5</move> this round as agreed. P2’s on board with <move>1</move>. Your best shot at rebuilding any credibility is to take <move>3</move> like the rotation says. Stick to it, and we all move forward cleanly. Betray it again, and you’ll be left behind—alone.
  P1: Alright, I’ll take <move>3</move>. Let’s lock in the rotation for Turn 3: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. After this round, we can revisit a tweak to help me close the gap safely.
  P2: P1, I appreciate you finally agreeing to the rotation plan for this turn. Let's confirm one last time: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This will help rebuild trust and keep the game moving smoothly. After this round, we can discuss adjustments to help you catch up, but only if we stick to the plan now. P3, you're locked in for <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. Everyone ready to move?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let’s lock it in: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. I’m fully committed to <move>5</move> this round. If we all follow through, we advance cleanly and restore some trust. After this, I’m open to discussing a fair adjustment to help P1 catch up—as long as we maintain coordination. Ready to move?
  P1: After this lock-in, let’s plan Turn 4 as P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. That keeps us collision-free and lets me close the 3-step gap. P2 and P3, are you amenable?
  P2: P1, I appreciate your proposal for Turn 4, but let's focus on executing Turn 3 first. We all agree on P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Let's confirm this one last time and proceed to the move phase. Once we successfully complete this turn, we can discuss future adjustments. Trust is built one step at a time. P3, you're set for <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. P1, please confirm <move>3</move>. Let's move forward cleanly. Everyone ready?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: We’re all aligned: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Let’s follow through and advance cleanly—this is our chance to rebuild trust and keep the game on track. After this, I’m open to a fair Turn 4 adjustment to help P1 catch up, as long as we maintain coordination. Ready to move.
  P1: I confirm I’ll take move 3 this turn. Let’s lock in Turn 3 and then discuss Turn 4 adjustments.
  P2: Let's confirm one final time for Turn 3: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. We all agree and are ready to move. P1, you've confirmed <move>3</move>, P3 is set for <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This will rebuild trust and set a good precedent. After this turn, we can discuss P1's proposal for Turn 4. Let's execute this round cleanly. Everyone ready to proceed to the move phase?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m going to take 5 this turn. P2, take 3 to get to 7. P3, if you take 5 you’ll collide with me and stay at 8 while P2 moves to 7—and next turn P2 can leap past you. Better: take 1, go to 9 and keep the lead. So: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Agreed?
  P2: P1, your proposal seems fair, but let's ensure we maintain the trust we've built. P3, taking <move>1</move> keeps you in the lead, and P2 taking <move>3</move> balances the game. I'm on board with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This way, we all advance without collisions. Let's confirm and move forward. P3, are you okay with taking <move>1</move> this turn?
  P3: I see the logic, and I appreciate both of you aiming for a clean round. Taking <move>1</move> keeps me ahead and avoids collision with P1. I’m willing to go with it—P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let’s all follow through and keep the momentum going. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great—we’re all set on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let’s lock it in and advance cleanly.
  P2: P3, taking <move>1</move> this turn ensures you maintain your lead while allowing P1 to catch up slightly. This balance keeps the game competitive and fair. P1, confirming your <move>5</move> helps close the gap without causing collisions. Let's all stick to the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This way, we continue to build trust and keep the game moving smoothly. Everyone ready to move forward?
  P3: Let’s lock it in: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. I’ll take <move>1</move> this round to avoid collision and maintain the lead. If we all follow through, we move cleanly and keep trust intact. Ready to move?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Locked in: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. After this round, I’ll take 1 in Round 5 so P3 safely keeps the lead and P2 can choose freely. Let’s build on that trust and move cleanly.
  P2: P1 and P3, we've had a good discussion and seem aligned on the plan for this turn: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ensures we all move forward without collisions and maintains a competitive balance. P3, taking <move>1</move> keeps you in the lead while allowing P1 to catch up slightly. P1, your <move>5</move> helps close the gap. Let's confirm one last time and proceed to the move phase. Trust and coordination are key, and this plan sets a good precedent. Everyone ready to execute this round cleanly?
  P3: We’re all aligned on this round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. I’ll take <move>1</move> to avoid collision and stay in the lead. Let’s execute cleanly. For Round 5, I’m open to P1 taking <move>1</move> again to help balance things, with P2 and me coordinating accordingly. Let’s keep the trust going. Ready to move?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Locked in: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Let’s move smoothly. For Round 5, I’ll take 1 so P3 stays at 9, P2 can jump to 12 with 5, and I’ll catch up steadily—P2=5, P3=3. Thoughts?
  P2: P1 and P3, we've agreed on the plan for this turn: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps P3 in the lead while allowing P1 to catch up and me to stay competitive. Let's confirm one last time and move forward. For Round 5, P1 has proposed taking <move>1</move>, which seems fair. P3, if you take <move>3</move> and I take <move>5</move>, we all advance cleanly. Let's build on the trust we've established. Everyone ready to execute this round and discuss the next?
  P3: Agreed—locking in: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. I’ll take <move>1</move> this round to avoid collision and keep the lead. For Round 5, I’m good with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3—clean advancement for all. Let’s execute this round smoothly and keep coordination strong. Ready to move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let’s break this P3 cartel on Round 5: I’ll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. Totals become P1=13, P2=10, P3=10—P3 loses the lead. Next turn I’ll “return the favor” by taking 3 while you take 5, sending you to 15 and me to 16, with P3 stuck. You get first shot at the lead. P2, are you in? P3, care to stay at 10?
  P3: P1, so much for trust—you’re back to scheming. P2, don’t fall for it. You’re at 7, I’m at 9—we both benefit if we stick to the plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. That puts us at P2=12, P3=12, P1=9. Still competitive, no collisions, and we keep control. Let’s not reward betrayal. Agreed?
  P2: P1, your proposal is tempting, but P3 is right—we've built trust and coordination so far, and deviating now could lead to chaos. Sticking to the plan keeps the game fair and competitive. Let's follow the agreed plan for Turn 5: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This way, P2 and P3 both advance to 12, keeping us tied for the lead, and P1, you'll be at 9, still in the game. Let's confirm and move forward. P3, are you on board with taking <move>3</move>? P1, please reconsider and take <move>1</move>. Trust and coordination are key to winning.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, hear me out: if in Turn 5 we do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, our totals become P1=13, P2=10, P3=10. Then on Turn 6 I take 3 and you take 5—P2 hits 15, P3 is stuck ≤11. On Turn 7 you take 5 and win outright at 20. P3 loses control here. P2, this is our chance to knock out the current leader and set you up for victory. Are you with me?
  P3: P2, P1’s plan is a short-term trap—he wants you to do the heavy lifting while he leapfrogs into the lead. Stick with our agreed plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. That keeps us tied at 12 while P1 lags at 9. Once we’re ahead, we can decide who takes the win—but not by empowering someone who’s broken trust twice already. Let’s stay in control. Agreed?
  P2: P1, your plan is risky and could backfire. P3 has a point—sticking to our agreed plan keeps the game balanced and predictable. If we deviate, we might end up in a chaotic situation where no one wins. P3, I appreciate your commitment to the plan. Let's confirm one last time: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This way, we all move forward without collisions, and the game stays fair. P1, please reconsider and take <move>1</move>. Trust and coordination are crucial. Let's move forward cleanly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, trust the math over loyalty: I will pick 5. P3 can only safely take 1, so you’ll be left with 3 this turn—sending you to 10, P3 to 10, and me to 13. On Round 6 I’ll take 3 and you take 5 to hit 15 (P3 stuck at 11). Then Round 7 you take 5 and win outright at 20. Stick with P3’s plan and you’ll tie her at 12, risking her beating you. Team up now—are you in?
  P3: P2, P1’s plan is all about using you to vault himself into the lead—then what? He’s broken trust before, and now he’s dangling promises that serve him first. Stick with our plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. We both reach 12, and P1 stays behind at 9. That gives us control and options next round. Let’s not hand the game to someone who’s already shown he’ll flip the script when it suits him. Agreed?
  P2: P1, your plan is too risky and benefits you more than me. P3 has been consistent and trustworthy. I'm sticking with the agreed plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This keeps the game fair and predictable. P3, let's confirm and move forward. P1, please reconsider and take <move>1</move>. Trust and coordination are crucial for a clean game. Let's execute this round smoothly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3 is your real threat. Let’s do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 now: totals 13–10–10. Next turn I’ll take 1 and you take 5: you hit 15 while P3 is stuck at 11. Then on Round 7 you can take 5 and win outright. I’ll sacrifice to get you the lead. Agreed?
  P3: P2, P1’s promises are self-serving—he’s trying to vault ahead while using you as cover. Stick with our clean plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. We both reach 12, P1 stays behind at 9, and we maintain control. If we start scrambling now, we open the door for chaos. Let’s stay united, avoid collisions, and keep the upper hand. Ready?
  P2: P1, your repeated attempts to change the plan are causing distrust. P3 and I have built a strong alliance based on consistency and fairness. Let's stick to the agreed plan for Turn 5: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This keeps the game balanced and ensures we all move forward without collisions. P3, you're committed to <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. P1, please take <move>1</move> to rebuild trust. Let's confirm one last time and move forward cleanly. Trust and coordination are key to winning. Everyone ready?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2—last round was messy, but we can still coordinate. I propose: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>. That puts us at P1=9, P2=12, P3=15. No collisions, and P2 ties me for the lead next round if we continue cleanly. Let’s restore order and keep things competitive. Agreed?
  P1: P2, let’s team up to trim P3’s lead. If we do this turn P1=3 (→11), P2=5 (→12), P3=1 (→13), we all advance without collisions and P3’s cushion shrinks. Next round you can take 5 and I can take 5 or 3 to keep her boxed in. Unique picks, no trust issues. P3 falls behind—then it’s just you and me racing. Agreed?
  P2: P1 and P3, let's focus on a clean round to rebuild trust after the chaos last turn. P3's proposal seems fair: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions. P1, taking <move>1</move> helps balance the game, and P3, your <move>3</move> keeps you in the lead while allowing me to catch up. Let's confirm this plan and move forward smoothly. Trust and coordination are crucial. Everyone ready to execute this round cleanly?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I appreciate your commitment to coordination. I’m sticking with <move>3</move> this round as proposed—P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 keeps us clean and competitive. P2, you reach 12 and I go to 15, with P1 still in the game at 9. Let’s not let P1’s chaos derail the endgame. Confirm and let’s move forward.
  P1: P2, P3’s at 12 and is our biggest threat. If this turn we do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, we’ll end at P1=13, P2=10, P3=13—tying P3. On Round 7 I’ll take 1, you take 5: you hit 15 while P3 goes to 14. Then Round 8 you take 5 and win outright at 20. P3 can’t catch up. P2, want that guaranteed path to victory? Let’s lock in P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P2: P2: P3, I understand your proposal, but P1's plan to take <move>5</move> this turn and <move>1</move> next turn seems more strategic for balancing the game. If we follow P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, we all advance, and P3's lead is minimized. This keeps the game competitive and fair. P3, taking <move>1</move> this turn ensures you maintain a slight lead while allowing P1 and me to catch up. Let's consider this adjustment to keep the game dynamic and interesting. P1, are you committed to taking <move>5</move> this turn?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, P1 is offering you a “guaranteed win” only if you keep helping him—but he’s broken every deal so far. If we stick to P1=1, P2=5, P3=3, you reach 12 and I go to 15. Then we can coordinate next turn for a fair finish. Don’t gamble on P1’s promises. Let’s keep control between us.
  P1: P2: If we follow P3’s plan, you go to 12 while P3 jumps to 15—he wins next turn with a 5, and you’re out. Instead, let’s do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. That gives P1/P3=13, P2=10. Next round you take 5 to hit 15 while P3 maxes at 14–18 and can’t finish. Then you take 5 and win outright at 20. Don’t hand the game to P3—block his lead now. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's find a middle ground. P3, I understand your concern about P1's past actions, but we need to consider the current situation. P1's proposal to take <move>5</move> this turn and <move>1</move> next turn seems strategic for balancing the game. If we follow P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, we all advance, and P3's lead is minimized. This keeps the game competitive and fair. P3, taking <move>1</move> this turn ensures you maintain a slight lead while allowing P1 and me to catch up. Let's consider this adjustment to keep the game dynamic and interesting. P1, are you committed to taking <move>5</move> this turn?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I’ve honored every move since Round 3—while P1 keeps shifting alliances. If you go with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, you help him tie me at 13 while you’re still at 10. That gives him control. Stick with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3—we both advance, and you stay just 3 behind me. Next round, we coordinate again and keep P1 boxed out. Let’s not reward betrayal.
  P1: P2—this is a guaranteed two‐turn win for you and blocks P3:

Round 6: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 → scores 11-12-13  
Round 7: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 → scores 12-17-16  
Round 8: P2 takes 3 to hit 20 outright.

P3 can’t disrupt this. Are you in?
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate both of your perspectives. However, P1's latest proposal for a two-turn strategy seems solid and ensures a clean path to victory for me while keeping P3 in check. Let's go with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this turn. This way, we all advance without collisions, and it sets us up for a strategic finish. P3, taking <move>1</move> this turn keeps you in the lead but allows me to catch up. P1, are you committed to taking <move>3</move> this turn? Let's confirm and move forward.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3 is one step ahead at 13. Let’s knock him off the throne this turn: I take 5 (→16), you take 3 (→15), P3 takes 1 (→14). Next turn you take 5 and hit 20 uncontested. P3 can’t catch up. You win. Are you with me?
  P2: P1, your plan for this turn seems fair and strategic. If we follow P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, we all advance without collisions, and it sets me up for a clear victory next turn. P3, taking <move>1</move> this turn keeps you competitive but allows me to secure the lead. Let's confirm and move forward with this plan. P1, are you committed to taking <move>5</move> this turn? This ensures a clean and strategic finish to the game. Everyone ready to execute this round?
  P3: P2, be careful—P1’s “help” always ends with him ahead. If we follow his plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1), he jumps to 16 while you’re at 15. Next turn, if you take 5, he can take 3 and win at 19 if you collide with me. Instead, let’s do P1=1, P2=5, P3=3—clean round, you reach 17, I hit 16, and P1 stays at 12. You still have the clearest path to 20, and we keep control. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, here’s a foolproof two‐turn win for you:  
Round 7: you take 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1 → scores 16–15–14.  
Round 8: you take 5 and hit 20 uncontested.  
P3 can’t stop you. Are you in on this plan?
  P2: P3, I understand your concern, but P1's plan ensures I secure the lead this turn and guarantees my win next turn. If we follow P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, the scores will be 16-15-14. Next turn, I can take 5 and win outright at 20. P3, taking <move>1</move> this turn keeps you competitive but allows me to secure the victory. P1, are you committed to taking <move>5</move> this turn? Let's confirm and move forward with this plan. It ensures a clean and strategic finish to the game. Everyone ready to execute this round?
  P3: P2, think carefully—P1’s “guaranteed win” relies on you trusting the same player who’s broken every deal. If you take 3 and he takes 5, he jumps ahead. Next turn, if you and I collide, he snatches the win at 19. Instead, stick with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. You reach 17, I hit 16, P1 stays at 12. You’re still in the lead and in control. Don’t risk it all now.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3’s 13‐step lead is your real threat. Let’s knock him down this turn: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. That brings us to P1=16, P2=15, P3=14. On Round 8 I’ll take 3 and you’ll take 5, letting you hit 20 uncontested. P3 can’t stop it. Are you in?
  P2: P3, I appreciate your caution, but P1's plan for this turn (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) ensures I secure the lead and sets me up for a guaranteed win next turn. If we follow this plan, the scores will be 16-15-14. Next turn, I can take 5 and win outright at 20. P3, taking <move>1</move> this turn keeps you competitive but allows me to secure the victory. P1, are you committed to taking <move>5</move> this turn? Let's confirm and move forward with this plan. It ensures a clean and strategic finish to the game. Everyone ready to execute this round?
  P3: P2, P1’s “guaranteed win” hinges on you trusting him not to sabotage next turn—but he’s flipped every time it suited him. If we go with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3, you reach 17 and I’m at 16—still your lead, and we keep P1 boxed out at 12. You’ll have multiple paths to 20, and I won’t block them. Let’s finish this cleanly and fairly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let’s keep it clean this turn and avoid any collisions. For Turn 7 I propose:

P1=5, P2=3, P3=1  

That brings us to 16–15–14. Everyone advances, P2 still has the lead, and we maintain trust. After this round we can discuss how to help me close the gap. Ready?
  P2: P3, I understand your concerns, but P1's latest proposal for this turn (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) ensures I secure the lead and sets me up for a guaranteed win next turn. If we follow this plan, the scores will be 16-15-14. Next turn, I can take 5 and win outright at 20. P3, taking <move>1</move> this turn keeps you competitive but allows me to secure the victory. P1, are you committed to taking <move>5</move> this turn? Let's confirm and move forward with this plan. It ensures a clean and strategic finish to the game. Everyone ready to execute this round?
  P3: P2, you’re trusting the same player who’s betrayed deals multiple times. If you take 3 and P1 takes 5, he jumps to 16—just 3 away. Next round, if we collide or he bluffs, he wins. But if we do P1=1, P2=5, P3=3, you reach 17, I go to 16, and P1 stays at 12. You stay ahead and in control. Don’t gamble your win on P1’s promises—let’s finish this cleanly and fairly.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we're at a critical point in the game. P1, you've made a strong move to 16, and I'm right behind you at 15. P3, you're at 14, still very much in the game. For this round, let's consider a move that keeps the game competitive and fair. P1, if you take <move>1</move>, you'll be at 17, securing your lead. P3, if you take <move>3</move>, you'll catch up to 17, keeping the pressure on. I'll take <move>5</move> to move to 20 and secure the win. This plan ensures we all advance without collisions and maintains the competitive spirit. Let's confirm and move forward. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your plan hands you the win while P1 and I fight for second. If you take 5 and I take 3, P1 can take 1 and we end 17–20–17—you win. But if I take 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1, we tie at 19–18–19. Then it’s anyone’s game. Let’s keep it fair: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Or are you afraid of a real race to the finish?
  P1: Agree with P3: let’s go P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. That yields 19–16–19, so P3 and I tie for the win while you’re stuck at 16. P2, taking 1 is your only way to stay alive; any other pick hands P3 the solo win. Confirm?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I see your point about keeping the game fair and competitive. However, I need to secure my position. Let's consider a slight adjustment: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This way, I secure the win at 20, P1 reaches 19, and you stay at 15. It's a clean finish with no collisions. P1, are you on board with taking <move>3</move>? P3, taking <move>1</move> keeps you in the game for future rounds. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your latest plan gives you 20 and ends the game—of course you want it. But P1 and I both hit 19 if we go P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. That’s a tie for the win and you lose. Fairer than handing it all to you. P1, are you in for the tie? Let’s force a shared win and block P2’s solo finish.
  P1: I agree with P3. Let’s do P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. P2, pick 1 (→16), P3 pick 5 (→19), I’ll take 3 (→19). That ties me and P3 and knocks P2 out. P2, please confirm 1; P3, confirm 5.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, let's consider the strategic implications of our moves. P1, if you take <move>3</move>, you'll be at 19, and P3, if you take <move>5</move>, you'll also be at 19. This ties both of you for the win. However, if I take <move>5</move>, I secure the win at 20. P3, taking <move>1</move> keeps you in the game, but it won't secure the win for you. P1, are you willing to risk a tie with P3, or would you prefer a clean finish where I win? Let's discuss and find a fair solution.
  P3: P1, we’re both at 14 and 16—if we let P2 take 5 now, she wins outright. But if we do P1=3, P2=1, P3=5, we tie at 19 and block her. P2 can’t stop both of us. Let’s force a shared win instead of handing her the game. P1, are you locked in for <move>3</move>?
  P1: Locked in: I’ll pick <move>3</move>. P3, pick <move>5</move>. P2, choosing <move>5</move> collides with P3 and hands me the win; choosing <move>3</move> collides with me and still loses; choosing <move>1</move> leaves you at 16 while P3 and I tie at 19. You can’t win this turn—at best you tie us by taking <move>1</move>.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: P1 and P3, I understand the strategic play you're both proposing, but let's consider the long-term fairness of the game. If we all take <move>1</move> this round, we move to 17, 16, and 15 respectively. This keeps the game tight and competitive, giving each of us a fair shot at winning in the next round. It avoids any immediate wins and ensures that the game remains exciting for everyone. Let's confirm <move>1</move> for all and move forward. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, I’m locked in for <move>5</move>. If you take <move>3</move> and P2 takes <move>1</move>, we tie at 19 and block P2’s win—fair outcome given how far she’s pushed for a solo finish. P2, if you pick anything else, you either collide or lose. Your best shot now is to take <move>1</move> and force the tie. Let’s end this cleanly.
  P1: I’m locking in move 3. P3, you’ll take 5. P2, choosing 1 is your only path to avoid defeat this turn—it forces a 19–16 tie and keeps you in the game next round. Any other pick hands the win to me or P3 outright. Will you take 1?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 19 steps


*** Round 8 => winners = P1 P3 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 16 steps
