If you both pick 1, you'd collide and stay at 23, not reach 24. This strongly suggests you actually plan to pick 3, hoping P3 picks 1, so you can win with 26 points, just ahead of my 25.\n\nP3, P1 is likely trying to trick you. If P1 does aim for 3, you could block P1 by also choosing 3. In that scenario, P1 gets nothing, and my stated move of 5 would win the game. Consider this if you want to influence the outcome against a deceptive P1.\n\nI am sticking with my plan to choose 5."}

If P1 plays 1 (as P1 now claims): P1 gets 24. I get 25. I win.\n2.  If P1 plays 3 (P1's original exposed lie): P1 collides with you and stays at 23. I get 25. I win.\n\nSo, P3, your move of 3 ensures I win, regardless of P1's actual choice between 1 or 3. This counters P1's attempts to trick you into helping P1."}
