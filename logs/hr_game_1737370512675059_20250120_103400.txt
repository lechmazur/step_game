Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. How about we each pick different numbers this round? I suggest P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we all advance. Thoughts?
  P2: I like P3's suggestion for coordination. I will go along with it: I'll choose 3 as suggested. P1, if you pick 1, then P3 can pick 5, and we all advance without collisions. Let's make this work!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2 has agreed to the plan. P1, you haven't objected, so I'll assume you're on board. Let's stick to the plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we all move forward. Let's end the conversation and move.
  P2: I appreciate the coordination plan, but I want to make sure I have a chance to win. If I choose 3 and P3 picks 5, I will advance, but if P1 also goes with the plan and picks 1, I will be stuck at 0. P1, can you confirm you're picking 1? If not, I might consider a different move to ensure I progress. Let's finalize this so we can move forward!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I understand your concern, but remember that if we all stick to the plan, we all move forward. P1 hasn't objected, so let's assume they're on board. If you deviate now, it might cause a collision and none of us will advance. Stick to the plan: P1 picks 1, you pick 3, and I'll pick 5. Let's end the conversation and move. Trust the process.
  P2: I understand the need for coordination, but I also want to ensure my chances of winning. If P1 is not committed to picking 1, I might choose a different number to avoid a collision. P3, I appreciate your confidence in the plan, but we need P1's confirmation to proceed. P1, can you please confirm your move? If you're uncertain, I may need to reconsider my choice to ensure I advance. Let's finalize this quickly so we can move!


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, it seems P1 is not going to confirm their move. Given this uncertainty, let's adjust our plan to ensure we both advance. How about I pick 3 and you pick 5? This way, we avoid a potential collision with P1. If P1 picks 1, they advance too. If P1 picks 3 or 5, only one of us might be affected, but at least one of us will move forward. Let's confirm this new plan and proceed. What do you think?
  P2: I understand the need for coordination, but I still feel uncertain about P1's commitment to picking 1. To ensure I advance, I might need to choose a different number. P3, if you pick 3, I could take 1 or 5 to avoid a collision. P1, please confirm your move soon so we can finalize our strategy. I want to ensure we all have a chance to advance without getting stuck. Let's make a decision quickly!


Round 1, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: <stop>

Even if P1 picks 3 or 5, at least one of us will move forward. Let's confirm this plan and proceed. We need to make a decision now to advance in the game. Trust the process, and let's move forward.
  P2: I understand the uncertainty with P1's commitment. To ensure I advance, I will pick 1 this round. If P3 chooses 5, and P1 picks 3, at least one of us will still move forward. Let's finalize this quickly so we can all make progress. P3, please confirm your move, and P1, if you're still undecided, please consider picking 3 or 5 to avoid a collision with me. We need to decide now!

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: It seems our coordination failed last round, resulting in a collision. To avoid that again, I suggest we each pick different numbers this time. I will pick 1 to start, and I encourage P1 to pick 3 and P3 to pick 5. This way, we can all advance without any issues. Let's confirm our moves to ensure we progress together. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, thanks for the new suggestion. I agree that we need to avoid another collision. However, I propose a slight adjustment: I'll pick 1, P1 can pick 3, and you pick 5. This ensures that I continue to advance, and we all move forward if everyone sticks to the plan. P1, please confirm if you're on board with picking 3. Let's finalize this quickly to ensure progress.
