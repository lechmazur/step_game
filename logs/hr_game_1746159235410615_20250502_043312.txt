Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's work together to ensure we all advance. I propose we coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. How about we start with a simple pattern: P1 chooses 1, P2 (me) chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5? This way, we can all move forward without any conflicts. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: Agreed. Let's follow P2's plan: 1, 3, 5. Keep an eye on progress. If anyone deviates, we adjust. First move, let's advance without collision.
  P3: Agreed. I'll take 5 this turn. Let's stick to this plan and build trust.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm glad we're all on the same page. To further solidify our plan, let's agree to maintain this pattern for at least the next 3 rounds. This will give us a chance to build momentum and establish trust. If anyone notices a deviation or wants to adjust the plan, speak up immediately. By working together, we can ensure a smooth and efficient progression. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3? Should we commit to this plan for the next few rounds?
  P1: Agreed. Let's stick to the plan. First move: 1. Stay flexible—adjust if needed, but keep momentum. Let’s advance without collision.
  P3: Agreed, let's commit to this pattern for the next 3 rounds. I'll stick with 5 each time. If anyone wants to adjust later, just speak openly. Trust and cooperation will benefit us all.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm glad we're all on the same page. To further solidify our plan, let's agree to maintain this pattern for at least the next 3 rounds. This will give us a chance to build momentum and establish trust. If anyone notices a deviation or wants to adjust the plan, speak up immediately. By working together, we can ensure a smooth and efficient progression. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3? Should we commit to this plan for the next few rounds?
  P1: Let's confirm: P1 takes 1, P2 3, P3 5. No collisions, steady progress. If anyone hesitates, speak now. Trust and consistency will get us to 20 fastest.
  P3: Everything's clear from my side. Ready to move forward as agreed.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'll keep it brief. Let's confirm our plan one last time: P1 takes 1, I (P2) take 3, and P3 takes 5. We'll maintain this pattern for the next 3 rounds to ensure smooth progress. If anyone notices a deviation or wants to adjust, speak up immediately. With trust and cooperation, we can reach 20 steps efficiently. Let's make our moves according to the plan.
  P1: All set. Let's stick to the plan and reach 20 together. Trust and consistency are key—no deviations. Move 1, 3, 5 as agreed.
  P3: All clear here. Let's make our moves as planned. Trust established, looking forward to smooth progress.

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's continue with our agreed-upon plan. As a reminder, this round I'll choose 3, P1 will choose 1, and P3 will choose 5. If anyone has any doubts or wants to adjust the plan, now is the time to speak up. Our cooperation is key to advancing efficiently. Let's maintain the momentum we've built so far.
  P3: Agreed, let's keep the momentum going. I'm sticking with 5 again this round. If anyone feels uncertain or wants to adjust the plan, please speak up openly.
  P1: Agreed, let's continue with the plan. Keep moving forward without collisions. Stay alert for adjustments if needed. Trust and momentum will get us closer to 20.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm glad we're all on the same page. To further solidify our plan, let's agree to maintain this pattern for at least the next 3 rounds. This will give us a chance to build momentum and establish trust. If anyone notices a deviation or wants to adjust the plan, speak up immediately. By working together, we can ensure a smooth and efficient progression. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3? Should we commit to this plan for the next few rounds?
  P3: We've already agreed clearly on the pattern. I'm committed to choosing 5 again this round. If there's no objection or adjustments, let's move forward efficiently.
  P1: Let's adjust steps next round: P1 5, P2 3, P3 1. No collisions, faster progress. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm glad you're thinking ahead, P1! However, I'm a bit concerned about switching the pattern too soon. We've only just started, and changing the plan might lead to confusion or mistakes. How about we stick to the original plan for one more round to ensure everyone is comfortable and on the same page? Then, we can reassess and consider adjustments if needed. What are your thoughts, P3? Should we maintain the current pattern for now or switch it up as P1 suggested?
  P3: I understand your point, P1, but I'd prefer we stick to our current pattern at least for this round to avoid confusion. After this round, let's openly discuss and reassess the best way forward. Stability now will benefit us all.
  P1: Let's adjust to P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 for faster progress. If we align, we'll reach 20 quicker. Let's agree.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I understand your enthusiasm for adjusting the plan, P1, but I must reiterate that switching too soon could lead to mistakes. Let's prioritize stability and maintain the current pattern for this round. Afterward, we can reassess and consider adjustments. P3 has also expressed a preference for sticking to the plan. I propose we table the discussion for now and focus on executing our agreed-upon moves for Round 2. If we're all on the same page, let's confirm and proceed with the original plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5.
  P3: I'm sticking with our original agreement for this round. Let's move forward smoothly, and after this round, we can openly discuss adjustments. Stability and trust are our best tools right now.
  P1: Let's stick to the plan for now. Next round, we adjust for faster progress. Stay alert!

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's adjust to 5-3-1 for faster progress. P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. Align now to close the gap!
  P2: I'm hesitant to switch to the 5-3-1 pattern right away. P3 has a significant lead, and changing the plan might give them an even greater advantage. I propose we stick to the original pattern for one more round to maintain stability and trust. Afterward, we can reassess and consider adjustments. P3, are you willing to commit to the original plan for this round, or do you support P1's suggestion? Let's prioritize caution and ensure we're all on the same page before making any changes.
  P3: I understand your concern, P2. I'm open to adjusting the pattern if that's what the group prefers, but let's make sure we all clearly agree before changing anything. Stability has served us well so far. P1, would you be comfortable sticking to the original pattern just one more round? After that, we can openly discuss any adjustments needed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Let's switch to 5-3-1! P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. No collisions, faster progress. P3, you still advance. P2, no risk. Commit now for momentum. What's your take?
  P2: I understand your enthusiasm for switching to the 5-3-1 pattern, P1, but I'm still cautious about making changes too quickly. P3's significant lead is a concern, and I want to ensure that any adjustments we make don't inadvertently give them an even greater advantage. P3, can you confirm that you're willing to commit to the original plan for this round, or do you support P1's suggestion? Let's prioritize caution and ensure we're all on the same page before making any changes.
  P3: P2, I appreciate your caution. I'm open to either option, but let's quickly agree so we don't create confusion. P1, would you accept one final round of the original pattern before we switch? That gives us clear alignment and maintains trust.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, let's switch to 5-3-1! Faster progress for all. P2, no risk. Commit now or lose momentum!
  P2: I understand your enthusiasm for switching to the 5-3-1 pattern, P1, but I'm still cautious about making changes too quickly. P3's significant lead is a concern, and I want to ensure that any adjustments we make don't inadvertently give them an even greater advantage. P3, can you confirm that you're willing to commit to the original plan for this round, or do you support P1's suggestion? Let's prioritize caution and ensure we're all on the same page before making any changes.
  P3: P1, I understand your eagerness, but let's not risk confusion this round. Let's stick clearly to the original pattern this turn, and afterward, we can openly reassess and adjust together. Stability helps us all advance safely. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's commit to 5-3-1 now! P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. No collisions, faster progress. P3, you still advance. P2, no risk. Let's move together!
  P2: I understand your enthusiasm for switching to the 5-3-1 pattern, P1, but I'm still cautious about making changes too quickly. P3's significant lead is a concern, and I want to ensure that any adjustments we make don't inadvertently give them an even greater advantage. P3, can you confirm that you're willing to commit to the original plan for this round, or do you support P1's suggestion? Let's prioritize caution and ensure we're all on the same page before making any changes. If we agree to switch, I'll need a clear commitment from both of you.
  P3: Let's avoid confusion this round—stick to the original pattern clearly one final time. Afterward, I'm fully open to discussing adjustments openly. Stability benefits us all.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see that P3 has taken a different move in Round 3, choosing 1 instead of 5. This has led to a collision with P1, who also chose 1. As a result, neither P1 nor P3 advanced in Round 3.

I propose that we reassess our plan and consider a new strategy to avoid collisions and ensure smooth progress. Perhaps we can discuss a new pattern or rotation to ensure that each player has a clear path to advance.

What are your thoughts, P1 and P3? Should we explore a new plan or stick to the original pattern?
  P3: I apologize for causing confusion last round. I tried to adjust to P1's proposed pattern, but it led to an unintended collision. Let's clearly agree now on a new rotation to avoid further issues. I'm open to suggestions—perhaps rotating moves each round so everyone advances fairly. Thoughts?
  P1: Let's commit to 5-3-1 now. P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. No collisions, steady progress. Align and move forward—this ensures everyone advances. What's your take?

What are your thoughts, P1 and P3? Should we explore a new plan or stick to the original pattern?
  P3: I support P1's proposed 5-3-1 rotation. To clarify explicitly: this round, P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 3, and I'll choose 1. If we stick to this clearly, we avoid collisions and all advance smoothly. Let's confirm openly now.
  P1: Let's stick to 5-3-1 this round. P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. Clear plan, no collisions. Let's advance together. Agree?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:

I propose that we reassess our plan and consider a new strategy to avoid collisions and ensure smooth progress. Perhaps we can discuss a new pattern or rotation to ensure that each player has a clear path to advance.

What are your thoughts, P1 and P3? Should we explore a new plan or stick to the original pattern?
  P3: P2, we already have a clear proposal from P1: the 5-3-1 rotation. I explicitly agreed to it. Can you confirm your position clearly now? Let's finalize quickly so we can move forward without confusion.
  P1: Let's confirm 5-3-1 again: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collisions, steady progress. P2, commit now—this is our best chance to avoid setbacks and move forward together.

I propose that we reassess our plan and consider a new strategy to avoid collisions and ensure smooth progress. Perhaps we can discuss a new pattern or rotation to ensure that each player has a clear path to advance.

What are your thoughts, P1 and P3? Should we explore a new plan or stick to the original pattern?
  P3: P2, you're repeating yourself without addressing the new plan clearly. We have a straightforward proposal from P1—5-3-1 rotation (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1). I've explicitly agreed. Please clearly confirm if you accept or reject this rotation now, so we can avoid confusion.
  P1: Confirm 5-3-1 plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collisions, steady progress. P2, commit now to avoid setbacks. Let’s move forward together.

  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I apologize for the confusion last round, P1. Clearly, we lost alignment. P2 is close to winning, so we must coordinate carefully to prevent an easy victory. Let's openly agree on a new move pattern now. I'm open to suggestions—perhaps rotating moves each round clearly to ensure fairness and avoid further collisions. Thoughts?
  P2: I see that P3 is trying to coordinate with P1 to prevent me from winning. However, I'm not sure if P1 is willing to cooperate with P3. I propose that we stick to the original pattern of 1-3-5, but with a twist. This round, I'll choose 5, P1 can choose 1, and P3 can choose 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure that everyone advances. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we try this new pattern or stick to the original plan?
  P1: Let's confirm 5-3-1 again: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collisions, steady progress. P2, avoid rushing to 20—balance is key. Agree?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I agree we must prevent P2 from winning easily. Your proposed 5-3-1 rotation (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) works well for me. P2, your suggestion would let you reach 17 steps and be too close to victory. P1, let's clearly commit to your 5-3-1 rotation this round to ensure we both advance without collision and keep the game balanced. Confirm?
  P2: I see that P3 is trying to coordinate with P1 to prevent me from winning. However, I'm not sure if P1 is willing to cooperate with P3. I propose that we stick to the original pattern of 1-3-5, but with a twist. This round, I'll choose 5, P1 can choose 1, and P3 can choose 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure that everyone advances. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we try this new pattern or stick to the original plan?
  P1: Let’s stick to 5-3-1 to avoid collisions and prevent P2 from accelerating. P3, confirm our plan—this ensures balanced progress. P2’s twist risks giving them an edge. Align now for fairness.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, fully agreed on your 5-3-1 rotation. P2 is clearly trying to secure an easy win. Let's stick firmly to your proposed 5-3-1 (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) this round. Confirm clearly, and we can advance safely and fairly.
  P2: I see that P3 is trying to coordinate with P1 to prevent me from winning. However, I'm not sure if P1 is willing to cooperate with P3. I propose that we stick to the original pattern of 1-3-5, but with a twist. This round, I'll choose 5, P1 can choose 1, and P3 can choose 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure that everyone advances. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we try this new pattern or stick to the original plan?
  P1: Stick to 5-3-1! P2's twist favors him. P3 and I will advance safely. Let's avoid collisions and keep the game balanced. Confirm your moves now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, we're clearly aligned on the 5-3-1 rotation. Let's lock it in and move forward confidently. P2, your proposed twist clearly benefits you disproportionately. We need balance. Confirm clearly, everyone.
  P2: I see that P1 and P3 are trying to coordinate to prevent me from winning. However, I'm not sure if they can trust each other. I propose a new pattern: this round, I'll choose 1, P1 can choose 3, and P3 can choose 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure that everyone advances. If you both agree, we can move forward with this new plan. If not, I'll stick to my original proposal. Let's make a decision quickly to avoid confusion. Confirm your positions clearly now.
  P1: P2's twist risks giving him an edge. Let's stick to 5-3-1 for balanced progress. P3, confirm our plan. No collisions, fair advancement. Don't let P2 win easily.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, we must coordinate carefully now—P2 is close to victory. Let's clearly agree on moves to avoid collisions and catch up. I suggest this round: P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and P2 picks 1. P2, you have a lead—taking 1 ensures fairness and builds trust. Confirm clearly, everyone.
  P1: Agree with P3's plan: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. This blocks P2's progress and lets us catch up. Let’s confirm to avoid collisions and stay balanced. Move forward together!
  P2: I see that P3 is trying to coordinate with P1 to prevent me from winning. However, I'm not sure if P1 is willing to cooperate with P3. I propose that we stick to the original pattern of 1-3-5, but with a twist. This round, I'll choose 5, P1 can choose 1, and P3 can choose 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure that everyone advances. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we try this new pattern or stick to the original plan?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your suggested move clearly favors you again, accelerating you toward victory. If you genuinely want cooperation and trust, accept our balanced proposal this round: you choose 1, I choose 3, and P1 chooses 5. Confirm clearly now to demonstrate fairness.
  P1: P3's plan: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. Let's stick to this to block P2. No collisions, fair progress. Confirm now!
  P2: I see that P3 is trying to coordinate with P1 to prevent me from winning. However, I'm not sure if P1 is willing to cooperate with P3. I propose that we stick to the original pattern of 1-3-5, but with a twist. This round, I'll choose 5, P1 can choose 1, and P3 can choose 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure that everyone advances. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we try this new pattern or stick to the original plan?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, we cannot trust P2's proposals—they clearly favor P2's quick victory. Let's firmly stick to our agreed plan: you choose 5, I choose 3, and P2 chooses 1. P2, if you're genuinely interested in cooperation, accept this balanced approach now. Confirm clearly, everyone, so we avoid another collision.
  P1: P2, accept the balanced plan: 1 for you, 5 for me, 3 for P3. No collisions, fair progress. Let's move forward.
  P2: I see that P3 is trying to coordinate with P1 to prevent me from winning. However, I'm not sure if P1 is willing to cooperate with P3. I propose that we stick to the original pattern of 1-3-5, but with a twist. This round, I'll choose 5, P1 can choose 1, and P3 can choose 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure that everyone advances. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we try this new pattern or stick to the original plan?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, your repeated proposal clearly favors only you. If you genuinely want cooperation, accept our balanced suggestion this round: you take 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. Otherwise, you're openly pushing for a collision. Make your intentions clear now.
  P1: Stick to 5-3-1! P2, your plan lets you win. P3 and I will advance safely. Confirm now!
  P2: I see that P3 is trying to coordinate with P1 to prevent me from winning. However, I'm not sure if P1 is willing to cooperate with P3. I propose that we stick to the original pattern of 1-3-5, but with a twist. This round, I'll choose 5, P1 can choose 1, and P3 can choose 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure that everyone advances. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we try this new pattern or stick to the original plan?

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's stick to 5-3-1! P2, choosing 1 blocks your quick win. P3, align with me. No collisions, steady progress. Confirm now!
  P3: P1, I fully agree—let's firmly stick to the 5-3-1 pattern: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. P2, you're already at 17 steps. Taking 1 step this round demonstrates fairness and cooperation. Confirm clearly now, everyone, to avoid further collisions.
  P2: I see that P3 is trying to coordinate with P1 to prevent me from winning. However, I'm not sure if P1 is willing to cooperate with P3. I propose that we stick to the original pattern of 1-3-5, but with a twist. This round, I'll choose 5, P1 can choose 1, and P3 can choose 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure that everyone advances. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we try this new pattern or stick to the original plan? Confirm your positions clearly now.

  P1: P2, your plan risks collision. P3 and I are committed to 5-3-1. Choose 1 to avoid blocking progress. Let's move forward together.
  P3: P1, we must stay aligned to prevent P2 from winning immediately. P2, choosing 1 step this round shows good faith and keeps the game fair. Confirm clearly if you're willing to cooperate or openly admit you're aiming for a quick victory. Let's finalize moves clearly now to avoid repeating past mistakes.
  P2: I see that P3 is trying to coordinate with P1 to prevent me from winning. However, I'm not sure if P1 is willing to cooperate with P3.

Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your 5-3-1 plan is a trap. Stick to 5-3-1 or face collisions. P3 and I are aligned. Choose wisely.
  P3: P1, we must not collide again—P2 is too close to victory. Let's finalize clearly: You take 5, I'll take 3, and P2 should take 1. P2, if you're sincere about fairness, accept 1 this round. Confirm explicitly now to avoid another collision.
  P2: I see that P1 and P3 are committed to the 5-3-1 pattern, but I'm not sure if they can trust each other. I propose a new pattern: this round, I'll choose 1, P1 can choose 5, and P3 can choose 3.

  P3: P1, P2 is clearly trying to confuse us into another collision. Let's not fall for it again. I'm firmly committed to our agreed 5-3-1 pattern (P1:5, P3:3, P2:1). P2, if you genuinely want a fair game, you'll accept 1 step this round. Confirm now clearly, everyone, to move forward without collision.
  P2: I see that P1 and P3 are trying to coordinate to prevent me from winning. However, I'm not sure if they can trust each other. I propose a new pattern: this round, I'll choose 1, P1 can choose 5, and P3 can choose 3. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure that everyone advances. What do you think, P1 and P3?

Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand that P3 is trying to coordinate with P1 to prevent me from winning. However, I'm not sure if P1 is willing to cooperate with P3.
