Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. This way, we all advance. What do you think?
  P1: I appreciate the suggestion, P2. However, I think it's risky to fully trust that everyone will follow through. How about we each choose randomly this round to see what happens, then adjust our strategy based on the outcome?
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your concern about trust, but starting with a coordinated approach could benefit us all initially. Let's try my suggestion for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. If it doesn't work, we can switch to random moves next round. P3, are you okay with trying this strategy first?
  P1: P2, I see the benefit of coordination, but I still have reservations. Trust is a big factor here, and I think we should be cautious. How about we agree on a backup plan if your suggestion doesn't work? If we collide, we can decide on a different strategy next round. P3, if you're okay with it, let's give P2's plan a try, but be ready to adapt quickly if needed.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, looks like our coordination didn't work out as planned. How about we try a different approach this round? Since P3 hasn't been engaging much, maybe we should focus on a strategy between us. I'm open to suggestions, but we need to ensure we don't collide again. P3, if you have any ideas, feel free to share. Otherwise, let's keep our moves unpredictable to avoid patterns.
  P2: P1, I agree we need a new approach. Let's try this: you take 1, I'll take 5 this round. P3, if you're willing to participate, take 3. If not, P1 and I will proceed with this plan to avoid collisions. We can reassess next round based on the outcome. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, since you're not engaging much, it's hard to predict your moves. P2, let's stick to your suggestion for this round: I'll take 1, you take 5. If P3 picks 3, we all advance without colliding. If not, at least we minimize our collision risk. P3, if you have any input or a different strategy, now's the time to share. Otherwise, let's proceed with this plan and adapt as needed in the next round.
  P2: P1, let's stick to our plan for this round: you take 1, I'll take 5. P3, if you're still not participating, that's fine, but joining us on 3 could benefit us all. Let's see how this round goes and adjust our strategy accordingly next round.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, our plan didn't work last round due to P3's unpredictability. Let's try this: you take 1, I'll take 3 this round. P3, if you're willing to join, take 5. If not, P1 and I will proceed with this plan to minimize collisions. We need to adapt quickly to P3's moves. Let's see how this round goes and adjust our strategy accordingly next round.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I understand your frustration with the unpredictability. Let's try a different approach: I'll pick 3, and you pick 1 this time. P3, if you want to join, try taking 5.
