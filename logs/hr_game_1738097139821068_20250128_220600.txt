Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I'll take <move>1</move> this round if you both agree to take higher numbers. We can rotate strategies in subsequent rounds to ensure steady progress for everyone. If we work together early, we can maximize our chances of winning later. What do you say?
  P3: Sounds good to me. P2, do you agree with P1's suggestion?  I'm happy to take <move>3</move> this round if you take <move>5</move>.  Let's get this game moving.
  P2: I agree with the coordination plan. I'll take <move>5</move> this round as suggested. Let's keep communicating and rotating our moves to avoid collisions and progress smoothly. Looking forward to a strategic game!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, it seems we’re all aligned on the coordination strategy. Let’s stick to this plan for now: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. If we keep rotating our moves systematically in future rounds, we can minimize collisions and ensure steady progress. Trust is key here—let’s honor this agreement for now. Unless anyone has objections or wants to adjust the plan, I propose we proceed as discussed.
  P3: Okay, sounds like we have a plan.  Just to confirm: P1 - <move>1</move>, P2 - <move>5</move>, and me (P3) - <move>3</move>. Let's stick to this for now and re-evaluate after this round.
  P2: I'm happy with our current plan. Let's execute it and see how it goes. If anyone has any other suggestions or concerns for future rounds, feel free to share. Otherwise, I'm ready to move forward with the agreed strategy.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, so I'll take 1, P1 take 3, and P2 take 5 this round?  Then we rotate again next round.  Sound good?  Let's keep this train rolling.
  P1: P3, your rotation plan seems fair. However, I propose a slight adjustment: let’s randomize our moves this round to test if we can trust each other fully. If we stick to predictable patterns, it might lead to accidental collisions later. I’ll still aim for <move>3</move>, but I suggest we all independently decide without confirming explicitly. This way, we can ensure no one feels forced into a rigid system. Thoughts? Or does anyone object?
  P2: I'm open to P1's suggestion of randomizing our moves this round to build trust. However, let's agree to revert to our rotation strategy in the next round to maintain steady progress. I'll take a random move this round, but I propose we confirm our moves for the following round to avoid confusion. How does that sound?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with randomizing this round.  Let's all choose independently.  Then, next round, we return to rotating, with P2 taking <move>1</move>, me taking <move>3</move>, and P1 taking <move>5</move>.  Does that work for everyone?
  P1: I’m fine with randomizing this round to test trust, but I want to ensure we’re all clear about reverting to the rotation strategy next round. P3’s proposed rotation for Round 3 (P2: <move>1</move>, P3: <move>3</move>, me: <move>5</move>) works for me. Let’s confirm now that we’ll stick to it strictly next round to avoid confusion. If everyone agrees, say so, and we’ll proceed accordingly.
  P2: I agree with the plan to randomize this round and then revert to the rotation strategy next round. Let's confirm the rotation for Round 3 as P2: <move>1</move>, P3: <move>3</move>, P1: <move>5</move>. This should keep us on track and minimize collisions. Looking forward to seeing how the randomization goes this round!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Sounds good.  Random this round, then next round P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. Confirmed.
  P1: I’m glad we’ve agreed to randomize this round while confirming the rotation for Round 3. Trust is critical, and this will be a good test. Just a reminder: sticking to our word in future rounds ensures we all progress steadily. If anyone deviates, it could hurt us all. Let’s play smart and honor our agreement. Unless anyone has concerns, I’m ready to proceed with this plan.
  P2: I'm ready to randomize my move this round as agreed. Let's see how it goes and stick to the rotation plan next round. Trust is key, so let's all honor our agreement. Looking forward to a fair and strategic game!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, let's do it.  Good luck this round everyone!
  P1: I’m confident in our plan to randomize this round and return to rotation next round. Let’s use this opportunity to demonstrate trust while keeping our long-term strategy intact. Remember, predictable patterns can lead to collisions later, so mixing it up now is a smart move. Unless anyone has doubts or wants to adjust further, I’m ready to proceed. Good luck, everyone—let’s keep the game strategic and fair!
  P2: I'm excited to see how the randomization goes this round. Let's keep our focus on maintaining trust and sticking to our rotation strategy next round. Good luck, everyone!

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's stick to our agreed rotation for this round: I'll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>. Last round's randomization didn't work out, so let's focus on maintaining trust and progressing steadily. If we all follow through, we can avoid collisions and keep the game fair. Any objections or adjustments to this plan?
  P3: Yes, let's stick to the plan. I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P1 takes <move>5</move>.  Confirm?
  P1: I confirm the rotation plan for this round: P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>5</move>.
