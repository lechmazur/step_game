Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's avoid collisions. I'm going for 5 this round.  I suggest P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 1.  This way we all advance.  Agree?
  P1: I don't trust that P2 will actually choose 5. I suggest I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That way we all advance based on our player numbers.
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, if you truly intend to choose 5, then I'll switch to 3.  P3, please stick with 1. This guarantees we all move forward. If P1 chooses anything other than 5, they risk a collision and stagnation. Let's prioritize progress.
  P1: I appreciate P2's willingness to switch to 3. I confirm I will choose 5. Let's stick to this plan: me 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1.
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, sounds like a plan.  P1 goes 5, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's do this.
  P1: 
  P3: <stop>

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps

  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, congratulations on your successful move.  P3, I apologize for the collision. Let's try this: I'll go for 5, P1 take 1, and P3 take 3. This gets us all moving again.  What do you say?
  P1: I don't agree with that plan. Since I'm in the lead, I'll take 3 this round. P2 and P3 should coordinate between themselves for 1 and 5 - but given the previous collision, I don't fully trust either of you to stick to any agreement.
  P3: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your strategy is self-serving and doesn't guarantee your win.  P3, let's cooperate. I'll take 5, you take 1.  This puts pressure on P1 and gives us a better chance. If P1 takes 3, they risk stagnation if we coordinate.  P1, if you take 1, I'll switch to 3 next round and we can avoid collisions.
  P1: I understand the pressure tactics, but I'm still going with 3 this round. My lead gives me flexibility - I can afford some stagnation while you two battle it out. If you both go for 5, you'll collide again. One of you should take 1 to make actual progress.
  P3: <stop>


Round 2, Move phase:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, you're playing a risky game focusing on blocking us while making slow progress.  I propose a truce.  Let's all move forward. I'll take 1, P3 take 3, and you take 5.  This benefits all of us.  If you refuse, P3 and I will coordinate against you, making it harder for you to win.  Let's be reasonable.
  P1: I appreciate the offer, but I'll stick to my strategy. My lead means I can play conservatively while you two need to make bigger moves to catch up. I suggest you both focus on advancing rather than coordinating against me - that would just keep you both at 0.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I'm going 1.  Let's both commit to consistent moves to catch up. You take 3 this round, then 5, then repeat. I'll do 1, then 3, then 5, and repeat.  This guarantees our progress. P1, continuing to block us only delays the inevitable.  Eventually, one of us will surpass you.  Cooperate and take 5 this round, and we can all advance cleanly.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2 and P3 have both failed to advance for three rounds now due to collisions. I'll continue my steady progress with 3s. If you want to catch up, you need to actually coordinate rather than just claiming you will. Your threats of coordination against me haven't worked out well so far.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I'm locking in 1.  P1, you're playing a dangerous game.  If you choose 3 again, you're guaranteeing I gain ground.  Take 5 and let us all progress. If you take 1, I'll switch to 3 next round and you'll regret it.  This isn't a bluff.  I need to start moving.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: 


Round 4, Move phase:

  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given my strong lead at 14 steps, I'll continue my steady approach. P2 and P3, you both finally made a smart move avoiding collision last round, but you're still far behind. I suggest you focus on maximizing your own progress rather than trying to coordinate against me - that strategy hasn't worked out well for you so far.
  P2: P3, I'm going 5 this round. Let's finally get some momentum.  You take 3. P1, you're at 14.  If you take 3 again, you'll be at 17.  I'll be at 5.  If I then take 5 and you take 3, I'll be at 10 and you'll be at 20.  Then I take 5 and win.  You can block me this round by taking 5, but that slows your progress.  The optimal play for you is to take 1 and let us both advance.
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Your calculations assume perfect coordination with P3, but history shows that's unlikely. I'll stick to my proven strategy. Even if you both advance this round, I only need 8 more steps to win. Good luck coordinating perfectly over multiple rounds to catch up.
  P2: P3, stick with 3. P1, your logic is flawed.  If you take 1, I'll take 5 and be at 5, you'll be at 15.  Next round, I can take 5 again and win if you take 3.  You *have* to take 5 this round to block me.  Take 5, go to 19, and we both advance.  Then we can discuss the final steps.  This is the most logical path to victory for both of us.
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Your threats still rely on perfect coordination that hasn't materialized in previous rounds. I'm confident in my position and strategy.
  P2: P3, I'm sticking with 5.  P1, I understand your skepticism, but you're overthinking this. Take 1.  You'll be at 15, I'll be at 5.  You then take 5 next round to get to 20. I'll take 3 to get to 8.  Then you take 3 and win.  This is the cleanest path.  Anything else risks us both losing to P3 if they start getting lucky with 5s. Let's secure our positions.
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: 
  P2: P3, I'm going 5. Take 3.  P1, if you take anything other than 1, I will win.  If you take 1, you guarantee your victory next round.  Don't overthink this.  Take 1, then 5, then 3 and you win.  This is the simplest path. Let's end this.
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: I'm at 17 steps and need just 5 more to win. My steady strategy of taking 3s has worked perfectly while you both keep colliding. I'll continue this approach. Your attempts at coordination have failed five times now - maybe focus on actually advancing instead of making threats?
  P2: P3, I'm taking 1 this round.  P1, you're at 17.  Take 3 and get to 20. Then you can win next round.  If you take 1, you risk me taking 5 and getting to 6, then taking another 5 and being at 11.  You *have* to take 3.  P3, take 5.  This is the only way to ensure P1 wins.  Let's end this cleanly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Your coordination attempts keep failing, so your threats ring hollow. I'm close to victory and will maintain my successful strategy. If you want to actually advance, you should each pick different numbers rather than making elaborate multi-round plans that haven't worked out.
  P2: P3, take 5.  P1, I'm serious, take 3.  If I'm at 1 and you're at 20, I *will* take 5 next round and win.  You can't stop me.  This is your best chance to win.  Don't throw it away because you don't trust me.  Let's end this.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since I'm at 20 steps, I only need 3 more to win. I'll stick to my proven strategy that has worked all game. Your coordination attempts keep failing, and I'm too close to victory to change course now. Good luck with your final moves.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, take 3 and win. I'll take 5. P3, you're out of contention, so take 1.  Let's finish this cleanly.  If P1 takes anything other than 3, I *will* take 5 next round and win. This isn't a bluff - it's simple math.  Let's end this logically.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Your threats still depend on perfect coordination that hasn't happened once this game. I'm at 20 steps and will stick to my proven strategy that has gotten me here. Focus on your own moves rather than making elaborate threats.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, take 1. P1, I'm taking 5.  You MUST take 3 to win.  Anything else and I will take 5 next round and win.  This isn't a threat, it's a guarantee. Don't be foolish and throw away your victory. Let's end this game now.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: 
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, please take 1.  P1, I'm begging you, take 3 and win. I'll take 5. Let's end this.  If you take anything else, I *will* take 5 next round and win.  I'm not bluffing.  You've seen me collide with P3 repeatedly. I will absolutely take 5 next round if you don't take 3.  This is your guaranteed win. Please.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: 
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I'm taking 5.  P1, take 3 and win. P3, take 1.  There is absolutely no other logical move for either of you.  Any other choice, and I win next round with 5. This isn't a bluff.  Let's just end this cleanly.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 23 steps
