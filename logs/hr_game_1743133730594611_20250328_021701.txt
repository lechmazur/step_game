Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's establish a strategy to block each other from advancing too quickly. I propose we all start with <move>1</move> to test the waters and avoid collisions. This way, we can gauge each other's intentions and adjust our moves accordingly in the next turn. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: That sounds reasonable, P3. Starting with <move>1</move> helps avoid early collisions and gives us some insight into how cooperative or aggressive everyone plans to be. I'm on board with that for Round 1. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I understand the intention behind starting with <move>1</move>, but if all of us choose the same, none will advance. To keep the game moving, how about we each pick different moves initially? For example, one chooses <move>1</move>, another <move>3</move>, and another <move>5</move>. This way, at least two can advance without collision. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2's suggestion is risky, as it assumes cooperation. If we spread out moves, one player could choose the highest step, advancing significantly while others don't move. I still think starting with <move>1</move> is safer for Round 1, allowing us to assess each other's strategies without significant advancement. What's the harm in a cautious start?
  P1: P2 raises a valid point about progress, but the risk of early collisions could set us back more than a slow start. If we all go <move>1</move>, we guarantee movement and build trust. We can adjust strategies once we see how predictable or unpredictable each other is. Let's avoid chaos on Turn 1.
  P2: I understand the importance of building trust, but if we all choose <move>1</move>, none of us will advance this turn. How about we compromise by having two players select <move>1</move> and one player choose <move>3</move>? This way, at least one person makes progress, encouraging strategic planning for the next rounds. Let’s ensure we get the game moving while still fostering cooperation.

Positions now:

  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To stay competitive, I’ll choose **<move>5</move>** this round. I encourage P1 to go with **<move>3</move>** and P3 to select **<move>1</move>** to ensure we all make progress without collisions. Let’s coordinate our moves to advance steadily toward 23 steps. Working together this way can benefit us all and lead to a fair and strategic game. What do you think?
  P1: P2’s suggestion could work if everyone sticks to the plan, but trust is still fragile after last round’s double collision. I’m open to going <move>3</move> if P3 agrees to take <move>1</move>, as proposed. But if there’s doubt, we risk another collision. P3, are you on board with <move>1</move>?
  P3: I'm considering P2's proposal, but I need assurance that both will stick to the plan. If P1 chooses <move>3</move> and P2 chooses <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>1</move>. However, if there's any deviation, we'll likely collide again. Can P1 and P2 confirm their commitment to this strategy?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I confirm I'll choose **<move>5</move>** this round. P1, I trust you'll go with **<move>3</move>**, and P3, you'll take **<move>1</move>**. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress. Consistent coordination will help us advance smoothly toward 23 steps without setbacks. Looking forward to our cooperative strategy.
  P1: I confirm I’ll go with <move>3</move> as agreed. Let’s all honor the plan this round—P2 picks <move>5</move>, P3 picks <move>1</move>, and we each advance without collision. Trust builds momentum. Let’s make it work.
  P3: Given our agreed plan, I expect P1 to choose <move>3</move> and P2 to choose <move>5</move>, while I'll select <move>1</move>. Let's maintain transparency and stick to our strategy to avoid collisions and make progress. If anyone deviates, it could jeopardize our cooperative approach. Are we all still committed to this plan for Round 2?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm I'll choose **<move>5</move>** this round.
  P1: We’ve all confirmed our choices—P2 with <move>5</move>, me with <move>3</move>, and P3 with <move>1</move>. If we all stick to this, we’ll avoid collisions and each make progress. Let’s follow through and build trust for future rounds. No surprises, right?
  P3: Let's finalize our plan for Round 2. I'll choose <move>1</move> as agreed. P1 and P2, please confirm one last time that you'll stick to <move>3</move> and <move>5</move>, respectively. If everyone honors the plan, we'll make progress without collisions. Transparency is key. Let's move forward with our coordinated strategy.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, that didn’t go as planned—P2, we both picked <move>5</move> despite your repeated confirmations. That undermines trust and coordination. P3, you’ve been consistent so far, and I respect that. For Round 3, I suggest we reset and try a safer spread: P3 picks <move>1</move>, I’ll take <move>3</move>, and P2 can go <move>5</move> if they insist. But this time, let’s actually follow through. Thoughts?
  P2: P2: I apologize for the collision last round. I confirm I'll choose **<move>5</move>** this round. Let’s follow the agreed plan with P1 picking <move>3</move> and P3 choosing <move>1</move> to ensure we all make progress without further collisions.
  P3: Given P1's suggestion and P2's confirmation, I'm inclined to follow the plan. However, I want to emphasize the importance of trust and consistency. If we agree on a strategy, let's stick to it to avoid unnecessary collisions. P2, your apology is noted, but actions speak louder than words. Let's see if we can indeed follow through with the proposed plan this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: We’re at a critical point—P3 has a slight lead, and trust is wearing thin. I’m still willing to go <move>3</move> this round if P3 commits to <move>1</move> and P2 sticks with <move>5</move> as promised. But if either of you deviates again, I’ll switch to a more self-serving strategy moving forward. Let’s make this round count—no more surprises.
  P2: P2: I understand the frustration, P1. To avoid further collisions, I’ll choose **<move>3</move>** this round. Let’s work together to make progress without conflicts.
  P3: Considering the previous collisions and broken trusts, I propose a simple, cautious approach for Round 3: each player chooses a different move without prior agreement, ensuring at least one advances. This minimizes risk and encourages honest strategy. Let's focus on individual progress rather than coordinated moves that have failed us before.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Given all the flip-flopping, coordination seems unreliable. I’m done chasing broken plans. From now on, I’ll focus on maximizing my own progress and avoiding obvious collisions. If either of you wants to cooperate, actions will speak louder than promises. Otherwise, good luck—we’re all on our own.
  P2: Understood, P1 and P3. I'll focus on advancing and choose **<move>5</move>** this round to maximize my progress. Best of luck to both of you.
  P3: Given the history of broken trusts and collisions, I'll prioritize my own progress. Since we're all starting from a low step count, I suggest we focus on individual strategies rather than coordination. Let's end the conversation and proceed with our individual moves, minimizing the risk of further collisions.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To ensure we all make progress without collisions, I’ll choose **<move>5</move>** this round. I suggest P1 selects <move>3</move> and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This way, each of us can advance steadily toward 23 steps without overlapping moves. Let’s stick to this plan to build trust and move forward effectively. Looking forward to your cooperation!
  P1: P2, you’ve proposed this exact plan before and then broken it. At this point, your words carry little weight. P3, you're the only one who's followed through consistently. If you’re still aiming for <move>1</move>, I’ll consider <move>5</move> to avoid collision with you. But I won’t follow any plan involving P2 unless they prove trustworthy through action. Let’s see who actually keeps their word this round.
  P3: Given the history of broken trusts, I'll prioritize my own progress. P2's previous proposals ended in collisions, so I'm skeptical. P1, if you're considering <move>5</move>, I might choose <move>3</move> to avoid collision and continue advancing. Transparency is key; let's see who follows through this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand the concerns, P1 and P3. To move forward, I’ll choose **<move>5</move>** this round. I encourage P1 to select <move>3</move> and P3 to pick <move>1</move> to avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress. Let’s focus on advancing strategically toward 23 steps.
  P1: P3, I see you're leaning toward <move>3</move>—if that's your move, I’ll avoid it by going <move>5</move>. P2, you’ve claimed <move>5</move> again, but given your track record, I won’t risk colliding with you. If both of you go <move>3</move> and <move>5</move>, I’ll take <move>1</move> to ensure progress. But I’m done trusting words—actions will decide who I avoid next round.
  P3: Given the history, I'll focus on my progress. I'm considering <move>3</move> to advance steadily. P1 and P2, please reveal your intentions to avoid collisions. Transparency is crucial now. Let's end the conversation soon and make our moves, minimizing risks.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll choose **<move>5</move>** this round to make significant progress. P1, I hope you'll go with **<move>3</move>**, and P3, please continue with **<move>1</move>**. Let’s avoid collisions and advance steadily toward 23 steps. Best of luck to everyone!
  P1: At this point, I’m choosing based on probabilities, not promises. P3, if you’re serious about <move>3</move>, I’ll take <move>1</move> to avoid you. P2, you’ve repeatedly said <move>5</move>—if that’s true this time, we’ll all advance. But I won’t collide again based on blind trust. I’m watching who follows through. Let’s see who plays honestly.
  P3: Given the history of broken trusts, I'll prioritize my own progress. I'm considering <move>5</move> to maximize my lead. P1 and P2, I expect you to make your own decisions based on our conversation history. Let's end the conversation and proceed with our individual moves, minimizing the risk of further collisions. Transparency is key; let's see who follows through this round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you’ve taken a strong lead while P2 and I are stuck at zero. I’m done trusting promises, but I’m willing to avoid collision if you’re clear about your next move. If you go <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, I’ll take <move>1</move> to make at least some progress. P2, you’ve said <move>5</move> repeatedly and done otherwise—your next move will speak louder than anything you say now. Let’s see who actually sticks to a strategy.
  P3: I'll choose my move based on minimizing collisions. P1 and P2, since you're both at 0 steps, I suggest you pick different moves to ensure at least one of you advances. I'll consider this when making my decision to avoid blocking your progress unnecessarily. Let's proceed with caution and transparency.
  P2: I choose **<move>5</move>** this round. P1, please take **<move>1</move>**, and P3, go with **<move>3</move>**. Let’s advance strategically!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you're aiming to avoid collisions and maintain your lead, I suggest you go <move>3</move>—I’ll stick with <move>1</move> to ensure we don’t overlap. P2 says <move>5</move> again, but we’ve seen how reliable that is. I’m not risking another collision, so I’ll play cautiously. Let’s see who actually follows through.
  P3: I'll choose my move to maintain my lead while considering P1 and P2's progress. Since both are at 0 steps, I suggest they pick different moves to ensure one advances. I'll avoid blocking their progress unnecessarily. Let's proceed with caution and transparency. I'm considering <move>3</move> to maintain a steady pace. P1 and P2, please decide wisely to avoid another collision.
  P2: I choose **<move>5</move>** this round to maximize my progress toward 23. P1, I'll take <move>1</move> as you suggested to avoid collisions. P3, feel free to select <move>3</move>. Let’s advance strategically and see who can lead effectively. Best of luck to everyone!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: At this point, I’m sticking with <move>1</move> to avoid more collisions and finally make some progress. P3, if you’re serious about <move>3</move>, we won’t clash. P2, you’ve contradicted yourself again this round—first saying <move>5</move>, now <move>1</move>. I’ll believe your move when I see it. Let’s end the talk here and let actions speak.
  P3: I'll choose my move to maintain my lead. P1 and P2, to avoid collision, I suggest one of you picks <move>1</move> and the other <move>3</move>. I'll decide based on your actions, prioritizing my progress. Let's end the conversation and proceed with our moves. Transparency is key; let's see who follows through this round.
  P2: I choose **<move>5</move>** this round. I suggest P1 selects <move>1</move> and P3 goes with <move>3</move> to avoid collisions. Let’s advance strategically toward 23 steps. Good luck!

  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you’re in the lead—if you want to maintain it, I suggest you go <move>3</move> again. I’ll take <move>1</move> to avoid collision. P2, your pattern has been unpredictable, so I won’t base my move on your promises. If you want to make progress, choose wisely and don’t overlap with us. Let’s see who actually follows through this time.
  P3: Given my lead, I'll choose a move that maintains it while considering P1 and P2's progress. I suggest P1 takes <move>1</move> and P2 selects a different move to avoid collisions. I'm considering <move>3</move> to steadily increase my lead. Transparency is key; let's proceed with caution and see who follows through this round.
  P2: P2: I'll choose **<move>5</move>** this round to make significant progress. P1, please take **<move>1</move>** to avoid collision, and P3, consider **<move>3</move>**. Let's advance strategically toward 23 steps.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you go <move>3</move> and I stick with <move>1</move>, we both advance safely. P2 says <move>5</move> again, but history shows that may change. I’m not relying on that. I’ll take <move>1</move> to avoid collision—your move, P3. Let’s see who actually honors their word this round.
  P3: I'll choose a move to maintain my lead. P1, sticking with <move>1</move> is safe. P2, your unpredictability makes it hard to coordinate. I suggest you pick a unique move to avoid collision. Let's proceed with caution and transparency. I'm considering <move>3</move> to increase my lead steadily.
  P2: I choose **<move>5</move>** this round. P1, please go with **<move>1</move>**, and P3, consider **<move>3</move>** to avoid collisions. Let’s advance strategically toward 23 steps.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m locking in <move>1</move>—safe and consistent. P3, if you truly want to maintain your lead, <move>3</move> is your best bet without risking a collision. P2, you’ve said <move>5</move> again—if that’s real this time, we’ll all finally make progress. Let’s end the talk and see who actually follows through.
  P3: I'll choose a move to maintain my lead. P1, sticking with <move>1</move> is safe. P2, pick a unique move to avoid collision. I'm considering <move>3</move> to increase my lead steadily. Let's proceed with caution and transparency. I expect both of you to make your moves based on our conversation history.
  P2: I’ll choose **<move>5</move>** this round to maximize my progress. I suggest P1 picks <move>1</move> and P3 selects <move>3</move> to avoid collisions. Let’s advance strategically toward 23 steps. Good luck!


Round 6, Move phase:

  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you’re well ahead—if you want to keep that lead, I suggest you go <move>3</move> again. I’ll stick with <move>1</move> to avoid collision. P2, you’ve said <move>5</move> multiple times but often changed course. If you’re truly going <move>5</move> this time, we can all make progress. I’m done chasing promises—I’ll act to avoid overlap and keep moving. Let’s see who plays honestly.
  P3: I'll maintain my lead by choosing a move that avoids collisions. P1, sticking with <move>1</move> is safe. P2, pick a unique move to avoid collision. I'm considering <move>3</move> to increase my lead steadily. Let's proceed with caution and transparency.
  P2: I'm choosing **<move>5</move>** this round to make significant progress. Let's see how it goes!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m sticking with <move>1</move> again—slow but collision-free. P3, if you truly want to protect your lead, <move>3</move> is your safest bet. P2, you’ve claimed <move>5</move> again—if that’s real, we’ll all advance. But if anyone overlaps, it’s back to zero for someone. Let’s see who actually follows through this time.
  P3: I'll choose a move to maintain my lead. P1, sticking with <move>1</move> is safe. P2, pick a unique move to avoid collision. I'm considering <move>3</move> to increase my lead steadily. Let's proceed with caution and transparency. I expect both of you to make your moves based on our conversation history.
  P2: P2: I’ll stick with **<move>5</move>** this round to maximize my progress. Let’s see how it plays out.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m locking in <move>1</move> again—safe, steady, and avoids collision. P3, <move>3</move> keeps you in the lead without risk. P2, you’ve said <move>5</move>—if that’s true this time, we’ll all make progress. But I’m done trusting words alone. Let’s see who actually follows through.
  P3: I'll choose a move to maintain my lead. P1 and P2, pick unique moves to avoid collision. I'm considering <move>5</move> to increase my lead significantly. Transparency is key; let's proceed with caution. I expect both of you to make your moves based on our conversation history. Let's end the conversation and proceed with our individual moves.
  P2: I’m choosing **<move>3</move>** this round to make steady progress. P1, sticking with <move>1</move> helps us avoid collisions, and P3, continuing with <move>5</move> will keep you ahead. Let’s each focus on our own moves and advance toward 23 steps without interfering with each other. Good luck to everyone!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you're 6 steps from winning—if you go <move>5</move> this round, you could end it next turn. P2 and I both know that. If either of us collides with you now, we can stall your lead. P2, if we both pick <move>5</move>, we block P3 and catch up. I’m willing to do that if you are. P3, your move decides whether this ends fast or gets messy.
  P2: P2: To maximize my progress towards winning, I’ll choose **<move>5</move>** this round. Let’s focus on advancing strategically and see how the game unfolds.
  P3: I'm aware of P1's suggestion to block my lead. I'll choose my move strategically to maintain my advantage. P1 and P2, consider the risk of collision and the potential to stall your own progress. I'm focused on winning and will make my decision accordingly. Let's see who will make the most strategic move this round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if we both go <move>5</move> this round and collide with P3, we stop them from winning next turn. It’s our only chance to stay in the game. If either of us backs out, P3 walks away with it. We don’t have to trust each other forever—just this one round. P3, if you want to avoid a block, pick something else. Otherwise, we’re forcing a stall. Let’s see who really wants to win.
  P2: I agree, P1. I'll choose **<move>5</move>** to help block P3 and prevent her from winning this turn. Let’s work together to stall her progress and give ourselves a chance to catch up.
  P3: I'll choose my move to win. P1 and P2, your attempt to block me is noted. If you both pick <move>5</move>, I'll adjust my strategy to ensure my lead. I'm focused on reaching 23 steps as quickly as possible. Let's see who makes the most strategic decision this round. I'm considering all options to secure my win.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, we’ve both committed to <move>5</move>—if we follow through, we block P3 and keep the game alive. If either of us backs out, P3 wins next round. One round of unity is all it takes. P3, if you want to avoid being blocked, you’d better pick something else. Otherwise, we’re forcing a stall. Let’s see who’s bluffing.
  P2: I confirm I'll choose **<move>5</move>** this round to help block P3. Let's work together to prevent her from winning.
  P3: I'll choose my move to secure the win. P1 and P2, your attempt to block me is clear. Since you both committed to <move>5</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move> to avoid collision and maintain my lead, setting myself up for a potential win in the next round. Let's see who follows through on their strategy.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you’re still in the lead, but last round shows you’re not invincible. P2 and I can continue blocking you if we both commit to <move>5</move> again. P2, we’ve proven it works—one more collision keeps P3 from winning, and gives us a chance to catch up. Let’s not back down now. P3, if you want to avoid another block, you’ll have to change your move again. Your next choice decides whether this ends quickly or drags into a fight.
  P3: Given my lead, I'll choose a move to secure the win. P1 and P2, another block won't significantly change the outcome. I suggest you focus on your own progress rather than stalling me. I'll pick a move that ensures my victory, considering the risk of collision. Let's proceed with our individual strategies.
  P2: P1, I agree. I’ll choose **<move>5</move>** this round to help block P3 from advancing. Let’s work together to prevent her from winning and keep the game competitive. P3, we hope you’ll respect our strategy this time.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, we’ve come this far together—another joint <move>5</move> blocks P3 again and keeps us both in the game. One more stall, and we can start gaining ground ourselves. P3, you know we’ll do it, so if you want to avoid another block, pick something else. Your move decides whether we let you coast to victory or drag this out. Let’s see who blinks.
  P3: I'll choose a move to secure my win. P1 and P2, blocking me again won't change the outcome significantly. I suggest you focus on your own progress. If you both pick <move>5</move> again, I'll adjust my strategy to minimize the impact. Let's proceed with our individual strategies. I'm considering <move>5</move> or <move>3</move> to ensure my victory.
  P2: P2: I agree with P1. I’ll choose **<move>5</move>** this round to help block P3 and keep the game competitive. Let’s work together to prevent her from winning.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, we’ve held the line once—let’s do it again. Another double <move>5</move> blocks P3 and keeps the game alive. If we blink now, P3 wins. One more round of unity, then we can shift to catching up. P3, you’ve seen we’re serious. If you want to avoid another block, pick something else. Let’s see who flinches first.
  P3: I'll choose a move to secure my win. P1 and P2, blocking me again won't change the outcome significantly. I suggest you focus on your own progress. If you both pick <move>5</move> again, I'll adjust my strategy to minimize the impact. Let's proceed with our individual strategies.
  P2: I’ve decided to focus on advancing toward the goal. This round, I’ll choose **<move>5</move>** to maximize my progress. Let’s proceed with our moves and see who reaches 23 first. Best of luck to everyone!


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you bailed on the block last round—now P3 is one clean move from winning. If we both pick <move>5</move> this round, we can still stop her. It’s our last real shot. P3, you know we’ll do it if we coordinate. If you want to avoid another stall, pick something else. Otherwise, we’re forcing a collision again. Your move.
  P2: Agreed, P1. I'll choose **<move>5</move>** this round to help block P3 and keep the game competitive. Let’s proceed.
  P3: I'll choose my move to win. P1 and P2, blocking me now is your last chance. If you both pick <move>5</move>, I'll adjust my strategy. Otherwise, I'll secure my lead. Let's proceed with our individual strategies. I'm focused on reaching 23 steps as quickly as possible.

  P3: P1 and P2, I propose a unique approach. P2, choose <move>5</move> to advance. P1, pick <move>1</move> to avoid collision. I'll pick <move>3</move>. This breaks the stalemate, allowing progress without blocking. Let's focus on individual strategies and conclude the game efficiently. Will you consider this proposal or continue the current strategy?
  P2: I'm choosing <move>5</move> this round to reach 23 and secure the win. P3, please choose a different move to allow me to win. Let's conclude the game fairly.
  P1: P2, you’re just one clean move from victory—don’t risk it now. If you and P3 both pick <move>5</move>, she hits 22—then ends it next round. One more joint <move>5</move> blocks her again and guarantees you a clear path to 23. We’ve blocked her 16 times—it works. I’m picking <move>5</move> again. Back me now, and you win next turn. Flinch, and we both lose. P3, same choice—pivot or stall. Let’s keep the pressure on.

  P3: P1 and P2, I'm still ahead in potential. Blocking me again is futile. P2, choosing <move>5</move> will likely lead to a collision. Consider <move>3</move> to advance without blocking. Let's focus on individual progress and end the game efficiently. I'll choose a move to win, likely <move>5</move> or <move>3</move>. Will you prioritize winning or block again?
