Sticking to our plan (P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 3) keeps things fair. However, to add a twist and make it more thrilling, how about we all agree to switch our choices at the last second? For example, I could pick 3 instead of 1, P2 could pick 1 instead of 5, and P3 could pick 5 instead of 3. This adds an element of surprise while still avoiding collisions. Thoughts? Let's confirm quickly and move to the move phase. Good luck!"}
