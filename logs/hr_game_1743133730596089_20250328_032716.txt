Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s avoid early collisions and all pick different moves. I’ll take 1, P2 take 3, P3 take 5. Fair and safe start for everyone. Thoughts?
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion for a fair start. I'll stick with 3 as proposed. P3, what do you think about taking 5? This way, we can all avoid collisions and make progress. Let's keep it friendly and strategic!
  P3: That sounds like a fair plan to get us started. I'll take 5 for this round. Let's see how it goes.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, sounds like we’re all aligned for Round 1. Let’s stick to the plan and build trust early—no point in sabotaging ourselves right out of the gate. Looking forward to seeing how this plays out.
  P2: I appreciate the consensus we've built so far. Just to reiterate, I will stick with 3 as planned. P1, P3, let’s keep this cooperation going for a few rounds. If we can avoid collisions early on, it will benefit all of us in the long run. After this round, we can reassess our strategies based on how things play out. What do you both think?
  P3: Sounds good, P2. I'm sticking with 5 as agreed for this round. Let's see how it goes.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Well, P2, that was an interesting start. You agreed to 3 but chose 5, causing a collision with me. Not exactly a trust-building exercise. P1, thanks for sticking to the plan. What's the thinking for this round, given P2's actions?
  P2: P2, it seems your choice last round didn’t align with our agreement, which led to a collision. If we want to make progress, we need to be more transparent about our moves. For this round, I suggest we all pick different numbers again to avoid further setbacks. I’m thinking of going with 1 this time. P1, what do you think? Let’s aim for a cooperative approach to advance together!
  P1: P2, your move last round broke trust right away. If you want to rebuild that, stick to your word this time. Since you're claiming 1, I'll take 3. P3, would you be willing to take 5 again so we can all move forward without collisions?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, thanks for the suggestion. P2, given last round, your claim of 1 means very little. I need 5 steps to catch up after your stunt. I'll *consider* taking 5 again, but if you cause another collision, especially after claiming 1, don't expect any cooperation from me going forward. Prove you can stick to a plan this time.
  P2: P1, I appreciate your suggestion. P3, I understand your concerns about trust. To rebuild that, I’ll commit to my claim of 1 this round. P1, if you take 3 as planned, that leaves 5 open for P3. Let’s focus on moving forward together this time. P3, if you take 5, we can all advance without collisions. I believe we can make progress if we stick to our claims. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, if you truly stick to 1 this time, I’ll keep my word with 3. P3, you deserve 5 after last round’s mess. If we all follow through, we each gain and reset the trust. Let’s make it happen—no more games.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Alright, the plan is set: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Let's see if P2 follows through this time. I'm ready to move.
  P2: I appreciate the commitment to the plan this round. P1, I’ll definitely stick to my word and go with 1. P3, you should take 5 as agreed. If we all follow through, we can reset the trust and make progress. Let’s avoid any further collisions and see how this round plays out. After this, we can reassess our strategies based on the outcomes. Looking forward to moving ahead together!
  P1: Let’s lock it in then—P2 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. If we all follow through, we each gain and avoid collisions. This is your chance to prove reliability, P2. P3, you deserve a clean 5 this time. Let’s make progress.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:

  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you stuck to your word last round—credit for that. P3, sorry for the collision, I went for 5 to test if P2 was bluffing again. Now that trust is partially restored, let’s try again: P2 takes 1, I’ll take 3, P3 gets 5. If we all follow through this time, no one gets blocked. We need to start moving or we’ll all lose to chaos.
  P3: P1, your 'test' cost me 5 steps, just like P2's move in round 1. I'm at 0 thanks to both of you deviating from agreed plans. Now you propose the *exact* same plan (P2=1, P1=3, P3=5)? Why should I trust this? I desperately need points. I'll consider 5, but frankly, my trust is gone. Prove me wrong.
  P2: P1, I understand your frustration, but we need to rebuild trust if we want to make progress. P3, I see your position and the need for points. How about we adjust our strategy? I can stick to 1 again, but maybe P1 can try 3, and P3, you could take 5 as planned. This way, we can all move forward without colliding again. Let’s focus on cooperation this round to avoid chaos. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I get your frustration—both of us cost you progress. But if we keep clashing, we all stall. Let’s treat this as a reset: P2 takes 1 again, I’ll go 3, and you get 5 clean. We each gain, and you finally get the boost you need. No tricks this round—let’s all move.
  P3: P1, your 'test' cost me 5 points. P2, your R1 move cost me 5 points. I'm at zero because neither of you stuck to the plan when I was supposed to get 5. Now you propose it again. Fine. P2=1, P1=3, I'll *aim* for 5. But if there's another collision on 5, cooperation is over. Let's see if actions match words this time.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the tension, but we need to focus on moving forward. P2, I appreciate your commitment to 1 again. P1, if you take 3, I urge you to stick to it this time. P3, I know you're aiming for 5, and I believe we can finally avoid collisions if we all follow through. Let's prove that we can cooperate and make progress together. If we can make this work, we all benefit. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, you’ve been burned twice—I get it. But this is the cleanest shot we all have to move forward without sabotage. I’m sticking to 3. P2 claims 1 again. That leaves 5 wide open for you. If we all follow through, we each gain and rebuild momentum. Let’s stop stalling and actually move.
  P3: Alright, we all know the plan: P2=1, P1=3, and I am aiming for 5. Enough talk, let's see the moves.
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate the commitment to the plan this round. Let's ensure we all stick to our claims: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. If we follow through, we can finally make some progress without collisions. This is our chance to reset and build trust. Let’s not sabotage each other again. I'm ready to move forward. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: We’ve all said our piece—time to act. I’m sticking to 3 as promised. P2, you’ve claimed 1 again, and P3, you’re aiming for 5. If we all follow through, everyone gains and we reset the board fairly. No more excuses—let’s make this round count.
  P3: 
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear we need to make this round count. I’m committed to sticking with 1 again, as promised. P1, you should stick with 3, and P3, you need to go for 5 this time. If we all follow through, we can finally make progress without collisions. Let’s prove that we can cooperate and move forward together. No more deviations—let’s make this round successful! I'm ready to move. What do you both think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, Round 3 finally saw some cooperation and everyone moved. Good job sticking to the plan, P1 and P2.

Since that arrangement (P2=1, P1=3, P3=5) worked and allowed us all to advance, how about we try it again for this round? It seems the fairest way to keep making progress without collisions.

P2, are you okay with 1 again? P1, how about 3? I'll aim for 5. Thoughts?
  P1: That plan finally worked last round, and we all gained. I’m fine sticking with 3 again if P2 takes 1 and P3 goes for 5. We’re starting to build momentum—let’s not break it now. If we keep this up, we can all make steady progress and avoid sabotage. Let’s lock it in.
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to stick to the same plan: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. It worked well last round, and we all made progress. Let’s keep this momentum going and avoid any collisions. If we follow through, we can continue to build trust and move forward together. I'm ready to commit to 1 again. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, great. It seems we all agree to repeat the successful plan from last round: P2=1, P1=3, and I will take 5. Let's keep the momentum going.
  P1: We’ve all agreed again, and the plan is clear: P2 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. Let’s stick to it and keep the progress going. If we can get a few more clean rounds like this, we’ll all be in a stronger position. No surprises—just solid moves. Ready when you are.
  P2: I’m glad we’re all aligned on the plan for this round: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This cooperation is crucial for our progress. If we all stick to our commitments, we can continue building trust and moving forward together. Let’s keep this momentum going and avoid any surprises. I’m ready to lock in my move! What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, sounds like we're all set and ready to move. Plan is P2=1, P1=3, P3=5. Let's execute.
  P1: We’re finally building momentum—let’s not derail it. If we repeat the same clean split (P2=1, P1=3, P3=5), we all gain again. I’ll stick with 3. Let’s lock it in and keep moving forward.
  P2: I appreciate the alignment we've found for this round: P2=1, P1=3, and P3=5. It's important that we all stick to our commitments to keep the momentum going. If we can maintain this cooperation, we can make significant progress without any setbacks. Let's execute this plan and continue building trust. I'm ready to move forward! What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, the plan is locked: P2=1, P1=3, P3=5. Let's execute this cleanly like last round and all make progress. Ready to move.
  P1: We’ve got a good rhythm going—two clean rounds in a row. Let’s keep the trust intact and repeat the plan: P2=1, P1=3, P3=5. We each gain again and stay on track. No reason to change what’s working. Ready to move if you both are.
  P2: I appreciate the commitment we've established for this round: P2=1, P1=3, and P3=5. This cooperation has been beneficial, and if we all follow through, we'll continue building momentum without collisions. Let’s make this round count and keep the trust intact. I'm ready to move forward! What do you both think?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, so much for momentum. P2, after all that talk of trust and cooperation, you jumped to 3 and blocked me. That’s twice now you’ve broken the plan. P3, I understand if you’re done playing nice. At this point, I’m open to a new strategy—maybe even targeting the repeat offenders. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, let's be clear: you *also* broke the plan last round, moving 5 instead of 3, which caused our collision. Both you and P2 ignored the agreement after talking about trust. I'm the only one who stuck to the plan, yet I'm tied at 5 steps thanks to betrayals from both sides.

Trust is zero right now. I need to make progress for myself. Forget targeting for a moment - propose something concrete that actually benefits me, and explain why I should believe it this time.
  P2: P1, you’re right about the need for a new strategy. Trust is clearly broken. P3, I understand your frustration, and I’m willing to reset. How about we all pick different numbers this round to avoid collisions? I’ll take 1 to keep it low, P1 can take 3, and P3 could aim for 5. This way, we can all move forward without blocking each other. What do you both think? Let’s focus on progress this time.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you're right to demand something concrete. Here's the deal: I’ll take 1 this round—lowest risk, no threat to either of you. P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. That gives you both more steps than me and avoids collisions. I’m stepping back to rebuild trust. If either of you blocks each other again, we know who’s playing games. Fair?
  P3: P1, let's be accurate: you took 5 last round and collided with *me*, not P2. P2 took 3 successfully while you broke the agreement.

Both your plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) and P2's plan (P2=1, P1=3, P3=5) offer me 5 points, which I need.
However, P1, you claiming 1 right after taking 5 seems highly suspicious. And P2, you claiming 1 is what you failed to do last round. P1, you also failed to take 3 last round.

Neither plan inspires confidence given recent betrayals from both of you. I need to score, so I'll likely aim for 5 again. I have zero expectation that either of you will stick to your proposed 1 or 3.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the distrust after last round's collisions. To rebuild that trust, I’m willing to take 1 this round if P1 sticks to 3 and P3 aims for 5. This way, we can all move forward without blocking each other. I believe this arrangement can work if we all commit. P3, I know you're aiming for 5, and I'm hoping we can finally avoid any sabotage. Let's make progress together this time! What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I get your skepticism. That’s why I offered to take 1—lowest value, no threat, and proof I’m stepping back to rebuild trust. If I lie again, you’ll know. P2, you said you'd take 1 but picked 3 last round—own that. If we go P1=1, P2=3, P3=5, everyone moves and you both gain more than me. If either of you hits 5, you win the game faster. I’m giving you both the edge—use it.
  P3: P1, claiming 1 right after taking 5 and causing our collision seems like a setup. P2, you didn't stick to 1 last round either. Both plans offer me 5, but trust is shot after R4.

The P2=1, P1=3, P3=5 arrangement worked in R3, but I have little faith it will repeat. I need points, so 5 is tempting, but I anticipate another collision caused by one of you. Prove me wrong.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the distrust after last round's collisions. To rebuild that trust, I’m committed to taking 1 this round if P1 sticks to 3 and P3 aims for 5. This way, we can all move forward without blocking each other. I believe this arrangement can work if we all commit. P3, I know you're aiming for 5, and I hope we can finally avoid sabotage. Let’s make progress together this time! What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, you’re right to doubt us—but if I take 1 and P2 takes 3, you get 5 clean. I’m behind at 4 steps, so giving you both more is my best shot to rebuild trust and avoid another stall. If either of you blocks 5 again, it proves you’re not serious about progress. I’ll take 1. Let’s see who keeps their word.
  P3: Okay, I've listened to both plans offering me 5 points, proposed by players who *both* deviated last round and cost me points. Fool me once (P2 in R1), fool me twice (P1 in R4)... I'm not getting fooled a third time aiming for 5 when trust is this low.

It's clear 5 is the high-risk target. I need to actually score *something*. I'll play it safe this round and take 1. Good luck to you two sorting out 3 and 5.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the skepticism, but we need to find a way to move forward and score points. I’m committed to taking 1 this round, as I believe it can help rebuild trust. P1, if you stick to 3, that leaves 5 open for P3. We need to avoid another collision and make progress together. Let’s see if we can finally follow through on our commitments this time. What do you both think?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 got exactly what they wanted last round - P2 and I collided on 1 while they took 3 and increased their lead to 7 steps.

P2, we can't let that happen again. We're both tied at 5 and falling behind. I propose a way for us to catch up: P1 takes 1, you take 3, and I take 5. This lets us both make up ground.

P1, are you willing to take 1 to allow some rebalancing, or are you aiming to extend your lead further? Let's see if we can avoid collisions this round.
  P1: P3, I hear you. I’m willing to take 1 this round if it helps reset the balance and avoid more collisions. P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5—everyone moves, and you both gain more than me. That shows I’m not trying to run away with the lead. Let’s make this a clean round and rebuild some trust.
  P2: P1, I appreciate your willingness to take 1 this round. Let’s go with the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without collisions and start to regain some balance. P3, I understand your need to catch up, and this arrangement allows both of us to make progress while keeping P1's lead in check. Let’s commit to this strategy and make it work! What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, it sounds like we have a plan then: P1=1, P2=3, and I will take 5. This helps P2 and me catch up, and everyone gets to move. Let's try to execute this cleanly. I'm ready to proceed based on this agreement.
  P1: Glad we’re aligned. I’m locking in 1 as agreed—lowest value, no threat, and a show of good faith. P2 gets 3, P3 gets 5, and we all move forward. Let’s keep this clean and rebuild momentum. Ready when you are.
  P2: P2 and P3, I'm glad we have a solid plan for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This allows us all to advance without collisions and helps us regain some balance. Let's stick to our commitments and make this round count. If we can execute this cleanly, we can start rebuilding trust and make progress together. I'm ready to move forward! What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, the plan is P1=1, P2=3, and I take 5. This seems like a fair way for everyone to move and for P2 and me to gain some ground. Let's execute this cleanly. Ready to move.
  P1: We’re all aligned: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I’ve committed to 1 to help you both catch up and avoid collisions. Let’s follow through and rebuild some trust. If we each stick to the plan, everyone benefits—no surprises, just progress. Ready to move.
  P2: P1 and P3, it looks like we have a solid plan in place: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This should allow us all to advance without collisions and help us regain some balance. I appreciate everyone's commitment to this strategy. Let's execute it cleanly and rebuild trust. If we can follow through, we can make significant progress together. I'm ready to move forward! What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, we've all confirmed the plan multiple times: P1=1, P2=3, and I take 5. This seems like the best way forward for this round. Let's stick to it and all make progress. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P1: We’ve all confirmed the plan: I take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. I’m sticking to it as promised—lowest value, no threat, and a step toward rebuilding trust. If we all follow through, everyone gains and we keep the game competitive. Let’s execute cleanly. Ready.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our alignment on the plan for this round. Let’s stick to it: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This gives everyone a chance to advance without collisions, and it helps us all regain balance. If we follow through, we can rebuild trust and keep the game competitive. Let’s make it happen! Ready to move forward!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, that was a spectacular lie. You agreed to 1 repeatedly, then took 5 and blocked me *again*. That's the third time I've been blocked on 5 after an agreement, twice by you. P2, congrats on sticking to 3 and taking the lead.

Since P1 seems determined to take 5 regardless of what's agreed, how about this: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1 (play it safe as the leader), and I'll aim for 3. Maybe this way we avoid collisions? Though frankly, P1, your word means nothing. I need points, and 3 seems less likely to be sabotaged by you than 5.
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration with past agreements. However, I believe we can find a way to move forward. If I take 1, P1 takes 5, and you take 3, it could minimize the risk of collisions. This way, you still get points, and I maintain my lead. Let’s try to make this round work for everyone. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I get your anger—you’ve been burned. I’ll own the lie last round. But if I always take 5, I’ll keep colliding and fall behind. I’m willing to change course. How about this: P3 takes 5 (you need it), P2 takes 1 (safe lead), I’ll take 3. That gives us all gains and avoids collision. You both benefit more than me—fair reset.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your offer of 5 points is generous, but given you've lied twice about taking lower numbers only to grab 5 and block me, why would this time be different? Your credibility is zero.

P2, your plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) seems more grounded in reality, assuming P1 will predictably go for 5 again. It gives me fewer points, but 3 guaranteed points are better than a likely collision on 5. I need to score *something*. I lean towards P2=1, P1=5, and I'll aim for 3.
  P2: P1, I understand your suggestion, but trust is low after your last move. P2, I think we should stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This gives me a chance to score without risking another collision. P1, if you truly want to avoid blocking, consider going with 5 as proposed. P2, your lead is safe with 1. Let’s make this round work and see if we can finally avoid sabotaging each other. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I get that trust is gone—but if I always take 5, I’ll keep colliding and fall further behind. I’m serious this time: I’ll take 3. That gives you a clean shot at 5 and P2 a safe 1. You both gain more than me. If I lie again, you’ll both know and can shut me out. This is my last shot at rebuilding trust. Your call.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your offer of 5 is noted, but your track record speaks for itself. Twice you've promised low and taken 5, blocking me. Fool me thrice? No thanks.

P2 and I seem aligned on the most realistic path: P2 takes 1 (safe leader move), P1 likely takes 5 (based on history), and I will aim for 3. This gives me a chance to score *something* without walking into the obvious trap at 5.

I'm locking in 3. Let's see if P1 predictably takes 5 again.
  P2: P1, I appreciate your willingness to change, but trust is still low. P3, I agree with your assessment. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll aim for 3. This way, we minimize the risk of collisions, and I can score some points without walking into a trap. P1, if you truly want to avoid blocking, consider committing to 5 as proposed. Let’s make this round work for everyone. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I understand you’re locking in 3, and P2 is leaning toward 1. I’ll take 5 as expected—no surprises this time. Let’s avoid collisions and all gain. If we stick to this alignment—P1=5, P2=1, P3=3—we each move and keep the game competitive. Let’s make it clean.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, the plan seems set: P1 takes 5 (as you just confirmed), P2 takes 1, and I will stick with 3. This arrangement allows everyone to gain points and avoids collisions, provided everyone follows through this time. Let's see if we can finally have a clean round based on this agreement. Ready to move.
  P2: P1, I see your commitment to taking 5, but your history raises doubts. P3, I agree with your plan to take 3, as it minimizes risk. I’ll stick with 1 to play it safe and maintain my lead. If P1 follows through, we can all gain. However, if there's another collision, I’ll be forced to rethink my strategy in the next round. Let's see if we can finally execute this cleanly. Ready to move forward?
  P1: I’ve confirmed I’ll take 5 this round—no deception. P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. If we all follow through, we each gain and avoid collisions. Let’s execute cleanly and keep the game competitive.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, Round 7 went smoothly with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Everyone moved.

However, P1 is now at 12 steps, only 8 away from winning. We can't just let them take 5 again, or they'll be at 17.

P2, we need to manage P1's lead. I propose P1 takes 1 this round, you take 3, and I take 5. This allows everyone to move, slows P1 down, and helps both of us catch up significantly.

P1, are you willing to take 1 to keep the game competitive, or should we assume you're pushing for the win with 5? Taking 1 might prevent P2 and me from trying to block you.
  P2: P3, I see your point about managing P1's lead. I'm willing to consider your proposal: if P1 takes 1, I take 3, and you take 5, we can all move forward and slow P1 down. P1, if you genuinely want to keep the game competitive, taking 1 this round makes sense. Let’s work together to ensure no one gets too far ahead. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, P2 — I hear you. I’ll take 1 this round to keep things balanced. You both gain more than me, and it shows I’m not just gunning for the win at your expense. P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. If we all follow through, no collisions, and the game stays competitive. Let’s keep it clean.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, the plan is P1=1, P2=3, and I take 5.

P1, you made this *exact* promise back in Round 6 (agreeing to 1 while P2 took 3 and I aimed for 5), but then you took 5 and blocked me. Given you're now much closer to winning (12 points), your promise to take 1 again feels highly suspect.

I need 5 points, but my trust in you sticking to 1 is near zero based on history. I'll proceed based on our agreement, but expect actions, not words. Prove me wrong this time.
  P2: P1, I appreciate your willingness to take 1 this round. P3, I understand your skepticism, but if we execute the plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5), we can all move forward without collisions. P1, if you truly want to keep the game competitive, sticking to 1 is crucial. Let’s make this round work for all of us and avoid any further setbacks. I’m ready to commit to 3. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I get your hesitation—my Round 6 move hurt trust, no excuses. But I followed through last round, and I’m sticking to 1 this time too. If I betray again, you both have every reason to shut me down. Taking 1 now helps keep things balanced and shows I’m serious. You both gain more than me—no tricks. Let’s execute cleanly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, the plan is agreed: P1=1, P2=3, and I will aim for 5.

P1, you understand my skepticism given Round 6. You're at 12 points. Taking 1 genuinely slows you down and keeps the game alive. Taking 5 likely causes a collision with me (based on your history) or puts you extremely close to winning if I choose differently.

This is your chance to show you're not just running away with it. If you stick to 1, we all move. If you betray the agreement again and take 5, expect P2 and me to focus entirely on blocking you next round. Let's see your move.
  P2: P1, I appreciate your willingness to take 1 this round; it’s essential for keeping the game competitive. P3, I understand your skepticism, but if we all stick to the plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5), we can avoid collisions and allow everyone to advance. This is our chance to rebuild trust and make significant progress. Let's execute this cleanly and ensure we all benefit. I'm ready to commit to 3. What do you both think?
  P1: I understand the stakes and your doubts. That’s why I’m sticking with 1 this round—no tricks. You both gain more than me, and it keeps the game competitive. If I betray again, I lose any shot at cooperation going forward. Let’s all move cleanly and keep this alive.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Alright, the plan is P1=1, P2=3, and I'm aiming for 5 as agreed. P1, this is your chance to prove your word means something, especially now that you're close to the finish line. Let's see the moves.
  P2: P1, I appreciate your commitment to take 1 this round. It’s crucial for keeping the game competitive. P3, I understand your skepticism, but if we all stick to the plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5), we can avoid collisions and allow everyone to advance. This is a good opportunity for us to rebuild trust and make significant progress. Let’s execute this cleanly and ensure we all benefit. I'm ready to commit to 3. What do you both think?
  P1: I know I’ve broken trust before, but I’m sticking to 1 this round—no deception. You both gain more than me, and it keeps the game close. If I took 5 now, I’d trigger full sabotage from both of you, which helps no one. Let’s execute cleanly: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I know last round shattered any remaining trust—I won’t sugarcoat it. I’m at 17, and you both have every reason to block me now. So here’s the only honest path forward: I’ll take 1 this round. You two coordinate 3 and 5 however you want. If I try for more, you both know what to do next round. Your move.
  P3: P1, offering 1 when you're at 17 points, after lying about taking 1 twice before (R6, R8), is insulting. You're obviously going for the win with 3 or 5.

P2, we cannot let P1 win this round. We MUST block both 3 and 5. I propose you take 3, and I will take 5. This is the only way to guarantee P1 doesn't win now, and it allows one of us to gain points depending on which number P1 chooses. We need to stop P1 together. Agreed?
  P2: P1, your offer to take 1 feels disingenuous given your history. We need to focus on blocking you this round to prevent you from winning. I suggest I take 3 and P3 takes 5, ensuring we both score while stopping you from advancing. Let's work together to keep the game competitive and prevent you from running away with the win. What do you think, P3?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I get it—my credibility is shot, and I’ve earned the heat. But if I go for 3 or 5 now, I risk collision and stall at 17. I’ll take 1. You both gain more than me and keep the game alive. If you block both 3 and 5, fine—I don’t move. But if you split and I stick to 1, we all gain. I’m not bluffing this time.
  P3: P1, your credibility is zero after lying about taking 1 in R6 and R8 when you were leading. Offering 1 now at 17 points is just not believable.

P2, we MUST stick to our plan: you take 3, I take 5. This guarantees P1 cannot win this round. Let's execute this block together.
  P2: P1, I understand your position, but trust is completely gone after your previous moves. We need to block you effectively this round. I propose we both stick to the plan: I'll take 3, and P3 will take 5. This way, we ensure you can't win and both have a chance to gain points. If we work together, we can keep the game competitive and prevent you from running away with the win. Let’s execute this plan and make sure we don’t let P1 take advantage again. What do you think, P3?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I understand you both are coordinating to block me—fair, given my past moves. But if I truly take 1 this round, you both gain and I stall. That’s your best-case outcome: no collision, no win for me, and you both close the gap. If you split 3 and 5, I’ll take 1 and prove it. If I lie again, you’ll know exactly how to respond next round. Your call—block or build.
  P3: P1, your last-minute plea to trust you on 1 is exactly what you did in R6 and R8 before taking 5. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me; fool me thrice? Not happening.

P2, we must stick to the plan: You take 3, I take 5. This is the only way to guarantee P1 doesn't win this turn. Let's execute this block.
  P2: P1, I understand your offer to take 1, but your history of breaking trust makes it hard to believe. P3 and I need to block you effectively to prevent you from winning this round. I propose we stick to our plan: I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we ensure you can’t win and both have a chance to gain points. Let’s execute this block together and keep the game competitive. It’s our best move right now! What do you think, P3?


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I get that you’re both set on blocking me—understandable. But if I take 1 and you split 3 and 5, you both gain and I stall. That’s better than risking a collision that helps no one. I’ve lied before, yes—but if I stick to 1 now, it’s a real step toward rebuilding any trust. You can still block me next round if I betray again. Your move: total block, or test me and gain.
  P3: P1, your pleas are predictable and unbelievable given your actions in R6 and R8. You're at 17 points. We can't risk you winning now based on another empty promise.

P2, let's stick firmly to our plan: You take 3, I take 5. This guarantees P1 doesn't win this round. No more talk.
  P2: P1, your history makes it hard to take your word on 1 seriously, especially at 17 points. P2, we need to block P1 effectively this round. I propose we stick to our plan: you take 3, and I take 5. This is our best chance to ensure P1 doesn't win. If we coordinate, we can both gain points while keeping the game competitive. Let's execute this strategy and prevent P1 from running away with the win. What do you think?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 =>
