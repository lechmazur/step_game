P3 is one step from winning, while P2 and I are close behind. P2, if you take 5, you reach 19 steps and block my potential win. I could take 3, reaching 18 steps while blocking P3's likely move. This keeps us all competitive without handing anyone an immediate victory. We need to coordinate our blocking strategy carefully - if either of us leaves a gap, P3 wins. What's your plan?"}
