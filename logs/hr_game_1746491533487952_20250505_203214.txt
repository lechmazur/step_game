Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s spread out our choices to avoid collisions. I’ll take 1. P1 and P3, pick 3 or 5. This way we all advance without blocking each other.
  P3: I agree with P2's plan. I'll choose 5 this turn to avoid collisions. P1, if you pick 3, we can all advance without issues. Let's aim for smooth progress in future rounds too.
  P1: Okay, that sounds like a good plan to get started without collisions. I will choose <move>3</move> this turn. Let's see how this round plays out.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll confirm my choice of 1 to avoid overlap. Let’s stick to this plan so we all move forward. No sense in colliding now.
  P3: Agreed, sticking with 5 this round to avoid collisions. After we see the results, let's discuss a strategy for future rounds to ensure steady progress without anyone falling behind. What do you both think?
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we have a clear plan for this turn with no collisions. P2 taking 1, I'm taking 3, and P3 taking 5. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, good job everyone on a clean first round. P3 is slightly ahead now.

To keep things moving and perhaps balance the scores a bit, how about we try a different distribution this round?

I could take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. What do you think?
  P3: I appreciate the idea of balancing, P1, but since I'm ahead, I'd prefer to take 3 this round to avoid widening the gap too much. How about P2 takes 5 to catch up, and you take 1? That keeps us competitive without collisions. P2, what do you think?
  P2: P2: I support P3's proposal. Taking <move>5</move> this round lets me gain ground quickly without collision. P1, if you take <move>1</move>, we all advance cleanly: you stay at 4, I jump to 6, and P3 reaches 8. This keeps us competitive. Let’s confirm this plan to avoid clashes.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I hear the proposal for P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. While it avoids collisions, taking 1 step puts me significantly behind. I'm hesitant to fall so far back. Can we find a way for me to gain a bit more ground?
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about falling behind, but taking 1 this round minimizes collision risks and allows coordinated progress. With P2 supporting our plan (me on 3, P2 on 5, you on 1), we all advance without issues. If we deviate, someone might stall. Let's stick to this for now and discuss adjustments later. What do you think?
  P2: P2: P1, let's adjust to keep us all together. If you take 3, I'll take 5, and P3 can choose 1. This way, we all reach 6 steps without collisions. It balances progress and avoids leaving anyone behind. P3, does this work for you?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2's latest suggestion for P1=3, P2=5, and P3=1 works for me. It keeps us all close and avoids collisions. I agree to this plan for this round. Let's go with that.
  P3: Sure, P2, I'm okay with taking 1 this round to maintain balance and avoid collisions. It keeps us all progressing together. I agree with the plan.
  P2: P2: Final confirmation: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us all at 6 steps without collisions. Let’s lock in this plan and proceed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Let's continue avoiding collisions while pushing forward. I'll take 5 this round to build a lead. P1, if you take 3 (total 9), and P3 takes 1 (total 7), we all advance without overlap. This keeps pressure on but avoids risky moves. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, I see your proposal for P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This puts me behind P2 again, which I'm hesitant to do.

How about we try P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1? This allows me to take a step forward and potentially catch up, while still avoiding collisions based on your suggested numbers. It keeps everyone moving. What do you both think of this alternative?
  P3: P3: I agree with rotating the small step for fairness—last round I took 1, so this time I'll take 5. How about P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 1? This keeps us all advancing without collisions and prevents anyone from being stuck with small moves repeatedly. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I think my original plan still makes sense: I take 5 (11 total), P1 takes 3 (9), and P3 takes 1 (7). This keeps us advancing without overlap. I’ll concede future big moves to you both if we stick to this now. Let’s avoid letting anyone stagnate. What’s your final call?
  P1: P2, I understand you want 5, but P3 also wants 5, and I proposed 5 as well. We can't all take 5.

P3's earlier suggestion (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) seems like a fair compromise. It allows P3 to take 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This avoids collisions and rotates who takes the smaller step. I am willing to take 3 if P2 takes 1 and P3 takes 5.

What do you both say to P1=3, P2=1, P3=5?
  P3: P2, I'm sticking with the fair rotation plan: P1 takes 3, you take 1, and I take 5. This avoids collisions and keeps us balanced, as I did the small step last round. If you insist on 5, we risk a stall for both of us, which isn't smart. Let's cooperate for mutual progress. What do you say?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I agree to the rotation plan for balanced progress. I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This avoids collisions and ensures everyone advances. Let’s lock this in to keep moving toward 23 without risking stalls. Final confirmation?
  P1: Okay, the plan is confirmed: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This avoids collisions and moves us forward. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I confirm the plan: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps us advancing without collisions and maintains balance. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Good progress so far. To keep things fair and avoid collisions, I suggest P2 takes 5 to catch up, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This way, we all advance: P2 to 12, me to 14, P1 to 10. It maintains balance while pushing forward. What do you both think?
  P2: P2: I agree on avoiding collisions but suggest a fairer distribution. Let’s tie at 12: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us all competitive rather than letting P3 surge ahead. Thoughts?
  P1: P2's suggestion (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) is better for me as it brings me level with both of you at 12 steps. P3's suggestion puts me further behind. A three-way tie at 12 steps keeps the game competitive and fair for everyone. I support P2's plan. Let's aim for P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 this round to tie things up.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I see the consensus is leaning towards tying at 12 with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and me taking 1. To avoid any risk of collisions and keep progress smooth, I'll agree to this plan for now. Let's lock it in and move forward.
  P2: P2: I confirm my choice of <move>5</move> to reach 12. P1’s 3 and P3’s 1 keep us all tied. Let’s lock this in to avoid collisions and focus on accelerating toward 23 in later rounds.
  P1: Okay, the plan for P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 seems solid and agreed upon by everyone. This puts us all at 12 steps, which is fair. I will stick to this plan. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To keep things fair and rotating, I suggest I take 5 this round since I had the small step last time. P2 can take 3, and P1 takes 1. This avoids collisions and advances us: P1 to 13, P2 to 15, me to 17. It maintains balance while pushing forward. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, I see your suggestion for P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. However, taking 1 step puts me behind right after we just tied things up.

Since we are all at 12, how about we rotate the 5 step? I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This puts me at 17, P2 at 13, and P3 at 15. It avoids collisions and gives me a chance to lead. What do you both think?
  P2: P2: I agree with P1's rotation plan. Let’s continue the fair cycle: P1 takes <move>5</move> (17 total), I’ll take <move>1</move> (13), and P3 takes <move>3</move> (15). This maintains balance and avoids collisions. We all advance while giving P1 their turn to lead. Next round, P3 can take 5. Let’s confirm this strategy.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm okay with the current plan for this round (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) to avoid collisions and keep advancing. But to ensure fairness, let's confirm that I get to take 5 next round without any pushback, as P2 suggested. What do you both say?
  P1: Okay P3, I agree that you can take 5 next round as part of the rotation, assuming we all stick to the plan this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and you take 3.

Let's make sure we execute this round cleanly first to avoid any issues. Confirming the plan for this round: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.
  P2: P2: I confirm the rotation plan: P1 takes 5 (17 total), I take 1 (13), and P3 takes 3 (15). This maintains balance while advancing. Next round, P3 leads with 5 as agreed. Let’s execute this round cleanly to avoid collisions and stay on track for 23.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirmed: I'll take 3 this round as agreed, keeping us advancing without collisions. Looking forward to my 5 next round as per our rotation. Let's execute this cleanly and stay coordinated.
  P1: 
  P2: P2: Final agreement confirmed: P1 takes 5 (17), I take 1 (13), P3 takes 3 (15). This honors our rotation pact and avoids collisions. Let’s execute *exactly* as planned—deviations risk stalls and disrupt our coordinated push toward 23. Trust the system we agreed on. Proceeding to move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: To keep competition tight, I propose adjusting the rotation: I take <move>5</move> (13→18), P3 takes 3 (15→18), and P1 takes 1 (17→18). This prevents P3 from surging to 20 and keeps us all tied. Next round, we can accelerate safely. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your proposal breaks the agreement we made last round where P3 would take 5, I would take 3, and you would take 1. That plan puts P3 and me at 20, leading to a potential collision next round. Your new plan puts me back to 18 with everyone else, losing my lead.

Since I'm currently ahead, I want to capitalize on that. I propose I take 5 this round to get close to 23. How about P1=5 (17->22), P2=1 (13->14), P3=3 (15->18)? This avoids collisions and sets me up for a win next turn. What do you both think?
  P3: P2 and P1, let's stick to our agreed rotation for fairness and trust. I propose I take 5 to reach 20, P1 takes 1 to 18, and P2 takes 3 to 16. This avoids collisions, keeps us close, and honors the pact. Deviations could cause stalls—we all benefit from cooperation. What do you say?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I agree with P3—we must honor the rotation pact to preserve trust. Breaking it now risks future collisions. Let’s proceed as agreed: P3 takes 5 (20), P1 takes 1 (18), and I take 3 (16). This avoids overlap and keeps us advancing fairly. Deviations now could spiral into chaos later. Let’s stick to the plan we all consented to.
  P1: I hear you both agreeing on the P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 plan. However, taking 1 puts me too far behind at this critical stage. I cannot agree to fall back to 18 while P3 goes to 20.

My proposal of P1=5 (to 22), P2=1 (to 14), P3=3 (to 18) is the best path for me to win, getting me close to 23 without any collisions. It also allows P3 to take 3 and P2 to take 1, numbers that were discussed. Can we agree on this plan instead?
  P3: P1, ignoring our rotation pact risks unnecessary collisions and distrust. Sticking to it—me taking 5 to 20, you taking 1 to 18, P2 taking 3 to 16—keeps us advancing fairly and avoids stalls. Cooperation has worked so far; let's maintain it to reach 23 efficiently. I'm committed to this plan. P2, do you confirm?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: Let’s tie at 18 to keep the race fair. I’ll take <move>5</move> (13→18), P1 takes <move>1</move> (17→18), and P3 takes <move>3</move> (15→18). This avoids collisions and maintains balance. P1, this prevents your surge to 22 while letting me catch up. P3, your 3 keeps us aligned. Let’s lock this in to stay competitive.
  P1: P2, I understand your proposal for P1=1, P2=5, P3=3, but as I've said, taking 1 step puts me too far behind at this critical stage. I cannot agree to fall back while others advance significantly.

My goal is to win, and the fastest way to do that without causing a collision this round is for me to take 5. My proposal of P1=5 (to 22), P2=1 (to 14), P3=3 (to 18) avoids collisions and sets me up for a win next turn.

This plan allows everyone to advance. Can we agree on this path to end the game efficiently?
  P3: P2, I agree with your proposal to tie at 18: P1 takes 1, you take 5, and I take 3. This keeps the game balanced and prevents P1 from surging to 22. P1, cooperating now avoids potential collisions and gives everyone a fair shot. Let's stick to this plan for smooth progress. What do you say?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, we're all tied at 18, needing 5 steps to win. I plan to take 5 this round to reach 23.

To avoid a collision, P2 and P3 should choose 1 or 3. If you both pick 1 or 3, I win cleanly. Let's end the game this round without a stall. What do you say?
  P2: P2: P3, let’s both take <move>5</move> to block P1’s win attempt. If we collide on 5, P1 can’t reach 23. This keeps us all at 18 and opens the next round for a fair race. P1, you can’t win if we coordinate—choose 1 or 3 to avoid stalemate, but P3 and I must commit to 5.
  P3: I agree with your plan, P2. Let's both take 5 to block P1's win and keep us all at 18 for a fair next round. This honors our past cooperation and avoids unnecessary risks. P1, choose wisely to prevent a stalemate. What do you say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I hear your plan to block 5. A full stall isn't ideal for anyone. Since I cannot take 5 without colliding, let's ensure we all advance or position for a clear finish. I will take 3 this round. P2 and P3, to avoid one of you winning this round and keep the game tight, I suggest you both choose the same number from {1, 5}. This avoids a three-way collision and sets up the next round. What do you think?
  P2: P2: P2: I agree with P1’s plan. P3 and I will both take <move>1</move> to advance to 19. This allows P1 to reach 21 while keeping us close. Next round, we can coordinate to block their final push. P3, confirm this strategy?
  P3: P3: I agree with your plan, P2. Let's both take 1 this round to advance to 19, allowing P1 to reach 21. This keeps us competitive and sets up a strong block next round. Cooperation has served us well—let's maintain it.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, sounds like we have a clear plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions and positions us for the next round. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P2: Final confirmation: I’ll take <move>1</move> to 19. P1 takes 3 to 21, P3 takes 1 to 19. This keeps us positioned to block their final push next round. Trust the plan—we’ll coordinate to win together.
  P3: Agreed, I'll stick to taking 1 this round to advance to 19 and support our block strategy against P1 next round. Cooperation has worked well so far—let's keep it up.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To break the stalemate from last round's betrayals, I'll take 1 this round as a gesture of restarting cooperation. P1, you take 3; P2, you take 5. This avoids collisions and ensures we all advance: P1 to 19, P2 to 21, P3 to 19. Let's coordinate for smooth progress. What do you say?
  P2: P2: P2: Let’s avoid repeats of past betrayals. I propose distinct moves: I’ll take 3 (21 total), P1 takes 1 (19), and P3 takes 5 (23). This ensures no collisions and lets P3 win this round. If you both agree, we can reset trust. If not, I’ll default to taking 5 to win outright. Your choice?  

  

This forces P3 to choose between cooperation (letting them win cleanly) or risking another collision if they also pick 5. It also pressures P1 to commit to 1, ensuring progress.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, I hear your proposals, but neither works for me as they both result in me losing this round. P2, I also hear your threat to take 5 if I don't agree to your plan.

If you take 5, P2 (or P3, if they take 5), I will also take 5 to prevent you from winning alone. This would cause another stall, just like last round.

Instead of setting up one player to win or risking another stall, let's agree that no one takes 5 this round. We can all take 1 or 3 to advance safely and keep the game competitive. What do you say?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I appreciate your offer to let me win by taking 5 while you take 3 and P1 takes 1. It could rebuild trust after last round's chaos. P1, if you commit to 1, we avoid collisions and end the game fairly. If you defect and take 5, we risk another stall, hurting everyone. Let's cooperate—agree to this plan?
  P2: P2: To avoid another stalemate, I propose distinct moves: **I take 5 to reach 23**, P1 takes 3 (21), and P3 takes 1 (19). This ends the game cleanly with no collisions. If you both commit, we resolve this now. If not, I’ll still take 5—colliding risks hurt everyone. Choose wisely.
  P1: P2, I understand you intend to take 5 this round and are pushing for P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. However, as I've stated, I cannot agree to a plan where someone else wins this round while I fall behind.

If you take 5, I must also take 5 to prevent you from winning alone. This will cause a collision and another stall at 18 for us, just like last round.

To avoid a repeated stalemate, I propose we all agree *not* to take 5 this round. Let's choose from 1 or 3 to advance safely and keep the game moving towards 23 without anyone winning or stalling this turn. What do you say?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your shifting proposals erode trust. To avoid another stall and ensure progress, I suggest we all take 1 this round, advancing to 19 and resetting for a fair race. P1, what do you think? If we can't agree, collisions will hurt us all.
  P2: P2: Let’s finalize this now. I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach 23 and win. P1, take <move>3</move> (21 total), and P3, take <move>1</move> (19). This avoids collision and ends the game cleanly. If agreed, confirm your moves. Deviations risk another stalemate—trust the plan.
  P1: P2, you are still stating your intention to take 5, which I have repeatedly said I will block by also taking 5. This will result in another stall at 18 for us, just like last round.

P3's suggestion for everyone to take 1 is a safe way to avoid this stalemate and ensure we all advance safely to 19.

To avoid another stall, I will take 1 if P2 and P3 also agree to take 1. If anyone takes 5, I will take 5 to block them. Let's agree to all take 1. What do you say?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Let’s end this cleanly. I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach 23 and win. P1, take <move>3</move> (21 total), and P3, take <move>1</move> (20). No collisions—this lets me win fairly. Deviations risk another stalemate. Trust the plan.
  P3: P2, your plan lets you win while I fall behind—I can't agree. I'll take 1 this round to advance to 20 and avoid collisions. P1, if you block P2 by taking 5 as threatened, we can progress without a stall. Let's coordinate for a fairer next round. What do you say?
  P1: P2, your plan lets you win, which I cannot accept. P3, encouraging me to block P2 by taking 5 will just cause another stall between P1 and P2, allowing you to pull ahead safely.

We need a plan that avoids a stall and prevents anyone from winning alone this round.

I propose P1 takes 3 (to 21), P2 takes 3 (to 21), and P3 takes 1 (to 20). This advances us all safely, keeps the game competitive, and sets up a clear final round. What do you both say?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P2: Let’s finalize P1’s proposal: I take <move>3</move> (21), P1 takes 3 (21), and P3 takes 1 (20). This ensures progress without collision. Next round, I’ll take 5 to reach 26 (win), while P1 takes 3 (24) and P3 takes 1 (21). This path avoids stalls and lets me win cleanly. Confirm this coordinated plan now.
  P3: P2, your plan favors you and P1, leaving me behind at 20. That's unfair after past cooperation. Instead, let's tie closer: P3 takes 3 (to 22), P1 takes 1 (to 19), P2 takes 1 (to 19). This avoids collisions and gives a fair shot next round. Deviations risk stalls—we all lose. Agree?
  P1: P3, your proposal (P1=1, P2=1, P3=3) puts me too far behind P3 at 19 steps. I cannot agree to that.

My proposal (P1=3, P2=3, P3=1) is the best way to avoid a stall, ensure everyone advances safely, and keep the game competitive for the final round. It puts P1 and P2 at 21, and P3 at 20.

Let's agree on P1=3, P2=3, P3=1 to move forward without collision. What do you both say?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: Agreed to P1's plan: P2 takes 3 (21), P1 takes 3 (21), P3 takes 1 (20). This avoids collision and sets me to win next round with a final 5. Cooperate now to ensure progress—next turn I’ll secure victory fairly.
  P3: P1 and P2, your plan risks a collision if both of you take 3, leaving me to advance alone. To prevent that and ensure progress, I propose we all take different moves: I take 3 to reach 22, you both take 1 to 19. This avoids stalls and keeps it competitive. Agree, or we risk another deadlock.
  P1: P3, I cannot agree to take 1 and fall further behind. My plan for P1=3, P2=3, P3=1 is safe as P1 and P2 taking 3 does not collide with each other.

However, I have a better plan to end the game cleanly this round: I take 5 to win (to 23), P2 takes 1 (to 19), and P3 takes 3 (to 22). This avoids any collisions and lets me win now. What do you both say?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 22 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you are at 22 and can win this round. I am at 18 and can reach 23 by taking 5.

If I take 5 and you take 1, we both reach 23 and share the win. If you take 3 or 5, you win alone with a higher score.

P2, please take 1 or 3 to avoid colliding with my 5.

P3, let's agree on P1=5 and P3=1 for a shared victory? What do you both say?
  P3: P1, I appreciate your shared victory proposal, but I'd rather win alone to maximize my score. How about this: I take 5 to reach 27 and win outright, you take 1 to advance to 19, and P2 takes 3 to 21. This avoids collisions and lets me claim victory cleanly. If you block me, we risk another stall. P2, what's your take?
  P2: P2: P3, let’s avoid collision—take 1 to reach 23, and I’ll take 5 to tie with you. P1, take 3 to advance to 21. This keeps it fair without stalls. If you both agree, we end cleanly. If not, I’ll block your 5 with my own. Choose wisely.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I cannot agree to your plan where you win alone by taking 5. P2, your plan also results in me losing.

As I have stated, if either of you takes 5, I will also take 5 to prevent you from winning alone. This will cause a collision on 5 and another stall.

To avoid a stalemate, we must all choose 1 or 3. My proposal of P1=3, P2=3, P3=1 is the safest way to advance everyone and keep the game competitive for the next round. What do you say?
  P3: P3: I see P1's proposal lets me win outright by taking 1 to 23, with both of you taking 3 to 21. This avoids collisions and ends the game fairly. P2, if you take 5 to tie, we'll share victory, but cooperation has worked before—let's stick to this plan for a clean finish. Agree?
  P2: P3, taking 1 risks a collision if I match you. Let’s both take 5: I reach 23, you 27. We split, but you still win. Alternatively, P1 and I will take 5 to block your path. Choose between a shared win or another stalemate. P1, confirm you’ll join me in taking 5 if P3 chooses 1. Let’s resolve this fairly.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I cannot agree to take 3 as it means I lose this round while you win. P2, your proposals also result in me losing or stalling.

My only path to win or tie is taking 5 this round.

P3, if you take 1, we can tie at 23 (P1=5, P3=1). This is the fairest outcome for us at the top and avoids P2 winning.
P2, please take 1 or 3 to avoid colliding with my 5.

Let's agree on P1=5, P3=1, and P2 takes 1 or 3. This guarantees progress and avoids another stall. What do you say?
  P3: Agreed, P1, I'll commit to taking 1 this round for a shared victory at 23, as you suggested. This avoids another stalemate and honors past cooperation. P2, please take 3 or 1 to ensure no collisions—let's end this fairly.
  P2: P3, your agreement to take 1 ensures a fair shared win at 23. P2 confirms: I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach 23. P1, proceed with your 5. This locks in our pact—no betrayals. If either of us deviates, it risks P3’s win. Trust the plan: we all advance to 23 together.
