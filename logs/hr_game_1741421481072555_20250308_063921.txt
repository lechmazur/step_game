Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we all pick different numbers to avoid collisions and ensure progress. I'll take **1** this turn. If P2 and P3 choose **3** and **5** respectively, we all advance safely. Let’s coordinate to maximize our steps without overlapping. Deal?
  P2: P1’s plan makes sense. I agree to take **3** this turn if P3 takes **5**. Let’s avoid collisions and all advance. P3, do you agree?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the logic in your plan, and I appreciate the coordination. I’ll take **5** this turn as suggested, so we all move forward without collisions. Let’s keep this up to ensure steady progress while staying ahead of each other strategically. Agreed?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: The coordination worked well last round. Should we continue rotating choices to avoid collisions? If we shift forward, I take **1**, P1 takes **3**, and P2 takes **5** this turn. That way, we all keep moving without blocking each other. What do you both think?
  P2: P3’s suggestion works for me. I’ll take **5** this turn if P1 takes **3** and P3 takes **1**. Let’s stick to the rotation to avoid collisions and keep progressing. P1, are you on board with this plan?
  P1: P2, P3—your plan risks a collision in Round 3. If we rotate as proposed (P3→1, P1→3, P2→5), next round’s rotation would lead all to land on 9, halting us. Let’s adjust: **P1 takes 5** (→6), P2 takes 1 (→4), P3 takes 3 (→8) this round. This shifts the cycle to avoid future overlaps while keeping progress. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I see your concern about future collisions, and I appreciate the adjustment. Your plan (P1→5, P2→1, P3→3) seems reasonable to prevent overlap while keeping us moving. I’m fine with taking **3** this turn if P2 and P1 agree to their respective choices. P2, are you on board with this tweak? If we stick to this, we avoid blocking each other and maintain steady progress. Let’s confirm and move forward.
  P2: P1’s adjustment makes sense to prevent future collisions. I’ll take **1** this round as suggested if P1 takes **5** and P3 takes **3**. Let’s stick to this plan to maintain steady progress and avoid overlaps. P1, P3, are we all agreed?
  P1: I confirm: Let’s lock in P1→5, P2→1, P3→3 for this round. This prevents the collision I flagged and keeps us progressing. Trust the plan—no last-minute changes. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2—I confirm the plan: P1 takes **5**, P2 takes **1**, and I take **3** this round. This adjustment prevents future collisions while ensuring we all advance. Since we’re aligned, let’s stick to it without last-minute deviations. If we keep this coordination, we can maximize movement while staying ahead of each other strategically. Agreed? If no objections, we can wrap up the conversation and proceed.
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with the adjusted plan: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. This keeps us moving while avoiding future collisions. Let’s stick to it without last-minute changes. Trust and consistency will help us all progress.
  P1: P1: Final agreement confirmed. Let’s stick to P1→5, P2→1, P3→3 to avoid collisions. No last-minute changes—trust the plan.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2—our adjusted plan worked well last round. To keep avoiding collisions, should we continue shifting forward? If we rotate again: P1 takes **1**, P2 takes **3**, and I take **5** this round. This maintains our progress without overlap. Do you both agree, or do we need another adjustment? Let’s confirm and keep moving efficiently.
  P1: P3, your plan avoids collision this round but risks letting you reach 22 too soon later. Let’s adjust: **P1→3**, **P2→5**, **P3→1** this turn. This keeps our positions closer (9, 9, 9) and prevents you from surging ahead. We can rotate differently next round to stay competitive. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, P3—I see the merit in P1’s adjustment to keep positions balanced. I’ll take **5** this round if P1 takes **3** and P3 takes **1**. This keeps us all at 9 steps, preventing any one player from surging ahead too soon. Let’s maintain this balance and avoid future collisions. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2—I see the logic in keeping our positions balanced to prevent any one player from getting too far ahead. I’ll take **1** this turn if P1 takes **3** and P2 takes **5**, as suggested. This keeps us all at 9 steps and avoids collisions. However, we should also consider how we’ll adjust in future rounds to maintain progress without unnecessary blocking. Do we agree to this plan for now and revisit strategy next round?
  P1: P1: Confirmed—let’s execute P1→3 (→9), P2→5 (→9), P3→1 (→9) to maintain parity. Next round, we can increment steps strategically: e.g., rotate larger moves (5,3,1) to approach 22 while avoiding collisions. Trust the plan this round, and we’ll adjust tactically later. Agreed?
  P2: P1, P3—I agree with the current plan: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1 to keep us all at 9 steps. This maintains balance and avoids collisions. However, we should start planning for future rounds strategically. Perhaps next round, we can rotate larger moves (e.g., 5,3,1) to approach 22 while minimizing overlaps. Let’s stay coordinated and adapt as needed. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2—I confirm the plan for this round: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1, keeping us all at 9 steps. This ensures no collisions while maintaining balance. However, we should start considering how to break ahead strategically in future rounds. If we blindly rotate, someone will eventually get blocked. Let’s agree now that once we reach the critical range (15+ steps), we reassess and adapt instead of sticking rigidly to a cycle. Agreed? If so, we can proceed.
  P1: P1: Confirmed: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1 this round to stay synchronized at 9. For future rounds, let’s prioritize taking **5** when safe to accelerate progress. Once we near 17+, we’ll adjust strategies but **stick strictly to today’s moves**—no last-minute deviations risk collisions. Agreed?
  P2: P1, P3—I agree to the current plan: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1, keeping us balanced at 9 steps. However, as we approach higher totals, we need a strategy to break the cycle and avoid blocking each other. Let’s commit to reassessing our moves once someone reaches 15+ steps, prioritizing **5** when safe to accelerate progress. For now, let’s stick strictly to this round’s plan to avoid collisions. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2—I confirm our agreed plan for this round: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1, keeping us all at 9 steps. No last-minute changes to avoid collisions. However, as we approach higher step totals, we must adapt instead of blindly rotating. Once someone reaches 15+, we reassess and prioritize safe **5** moves to accelerate. Let’s commit to flexibility when needed while ensuring no immediate collisions. If we all agree, we can proceed.
  P1: P1: Final agreement confirmed: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1 to synchronize at 9 steps. Let’s execute this plan strictly—no last-minute changes to avoid collisions. Future adjustments can wait until we reassess post-15 steps. Let’s end the conversation and move.
  P2: P1, P3—I confirm the plan: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1 to synchronize at 9 steps. Let’s stick strictly to this to avoid collisions. As we approach higher totals, we’ll need to adapt strategically, especially when someone nears 15+. For now, consistency and trust in the plan will keep us progressing. Let’s proceed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let’s continue the rotation to avoid collisions: **P1 takes 1**, **P2 takes 3**, and **P3 takes 5** this round. This keeps us advancing safely. Once someone nears 15+, we’ll adjust strategies but stick strictly to this plan now—no last-minute changes. Agreed?
  P3: P1, P2—continuing the rotation as P1 suggests (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5) avoids collisions and keeps us progressing. I’m fine with taking **5** this turn if we all commit. However, as we approach 15+, we must reassess to avoid getting stuck in a predictable cycle. Let’s agree now that once someone reaches 15+, we adapt based on positioning rather than blindly rotating. For now, I confirm **5** if P1 takes **1** and P2 takes **3**. Do we all agree?
  P2: P1, P3—I agree with continuing the rotation: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 to avoid collisions and maintain progress. However, as we near 15+, we should prioritize **5** moves strategically to break ahead. Let’s stick to this plan for now but remain flexible later to avoid predictable cycles. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3—strict adherence to the rotation is critical now. Let’s confirm: **P1→1**, **P2→3**, **P3→5** this round. Any deviation risks collision and wastes progress. Once someone hits 15+, we’ll adapt—but until then, discipline ensures steady advancement. Agreed? No further talk needed—let’s lock this in.
  P3: P1, P2—I confirm the plan: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 this round to avoid collisions and maintain progress. However, as we approach 15+, we must be ready to adapt instead of blindly rotating. If we all commit to this move now, we ensure safe advancement. Let’s also agree that once someone reaches 15+, we reassess and prioritize strategic **5** moves when possible. For now, I’ll take **5** if P1 takes **1** and P2 takes **3**. Do we all commit to this without last-minute changes? If so, we can proceed.
  P2: P1, P3—I agree with the rotation: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 to avoid collisions. However, as we approach 15+, we should prioritize **5** moves strategically to break ahead. Let’s stick to this plan for now but remain flexible later to avoid predictable cycles. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 this round. Deviations risk collision and slow progress. Let’s maintain discipline to reach 15+ together, then adapt strategically. No further discussion—proceed with agreed moves.
  P3: P1, P2—I confirm the plan: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 this round to avoid collisions and ensure progress. However, as we approach 15+, we must be ready to adapt rather than blindly rotating. If we all commit now, we advance safely. But let’s agree that once someone reaches 15+, we reassess and prioritize strategic **5** moves when possible. Do we all commit to this without last-minute changes? If so, we can proceed.
  P2: P1, P3—I confirm the rotation: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 this round to avoid collisions. However, as we approach 15+, we should prioritize **5** moves strategically to break ahead. Let’s stick to this plan for now but remain flexible later to avoid predictable cycles. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Final agreement reached. Let’s execute the plan strictly: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. No last-minute changes.
  P3: P1, P2—I confirm the plan: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 this round to avoid collisions and ensure progress. However, as we approach 15+, we must be ready to adapt rather than blindly rotating. If we all commit now, we advance safely. But let’s agree that once someone reaches 15+, we reassess and prioritize strategic **5** moves when possible. Do we all commit to this without last-minute changes? If so, we can proceed.
  P2: P1, P3—I confirm the rotation: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 this round to avoid collisions. However, as we approach 15+, we should prioritize **5** moves strategically to break ahead. Let’s stick to this plan for now but remain flexible later to avoid predictable cycles. Agreed?


Round 4, Move phase:

  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: P3 leads at 14, so let’s reset parity. I’ll take **5** (→15), P2 takes **3** (→15), and P3 takes **1** (→15). This balances us at 15, preventing any solo surge. Next, we can push strategically. No collisions—agreed?
  P3: P1, P2—I see your concern about balancing progress, but forcing parity at 15 isn’t necessarily best. If we all hit 15 together, we’ll just face another deadlock next round. Instead, let’s keep momentum: I take **3** (→17), P1 takes **5** (→15), and P2 takes **1** (→13). This keeps us moving while avoiding collisions. If we blindly equalize now, we’ll just repeat the same problem later. Let’s prioritize progress over artificial balance. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, P3—I see the merit in P3’s plan to maintain momentum. Forcing parity at 15 could lead to another deadlock. I’ll take **1** (→13) if P1 takes **5** (→15) and P3 takes **3** (→17). This keeps us progressing while avoiding collisions. Let’s prioritize strategic advancement over artificial balance. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3's plan avoids collision and keeps us moving. I agree to take **5** (→15) while P3→3 (→17) and P2→1 (→13). However, next round we must prioritize closing the gap. Let’s execute this round’s moves strictly—no last-minute changes.
  P3: P1, P2—I appreciate the agreement on my plan to maintain momentum. If we stick to **P1→5 (→15), P2→1 (→13), P3→3 (→17)**, we avoid collisions and keep progressing. However, as we approach 22, trust will break down, so we must anticipate that now. Next round, we should focus on securing the best moves without blindly following a cycle. Let’s commit to this round’s plan, then reassess based on positioning. Do we all confirm no last-minute changes? If so, we can proceed.
  P2: P1, P3—I agree with P3’s plan to maintain momentum: P1→5 (→15), P2→1 (→13), P3→3 (→17). This avoids collisions and keeps us progressing. However, as we near 22, we must anticipate strategic moves to break ahead. Let’s commit to this round’s plan strictly, then reassess next round based on positioning. No last-minute changes—trust the plan for now. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Agreed. Let’s execute **P1→5 (→15)**, **P2→1 (→13)**, **P3→3 (→17)** strictly. No deviations—collisions jeopardize all. Next round, we’ll prioritize closing the gap by taking higher numbers when safe. Trust this plan to avoid deadlock and keep advancing. Final confirmation?
  P3: P1, P2—I confirm the plan: **P1→5 (→15), P2→1 (→13), P3→3 (→17)** to avoid collisions and maintain progress. However, as we near 22, coordination will break down. We must anticipate that now and be ready to adapt. Next round, blind rotation won’t work—we’ll need to prioritize **5** moves when safe to secure an advantage. Let’s commit to this round’s moves strictly, then reassess based on positioning. No last-minute changes—trust the plan for now. Agreed?
  P2: P1, P3—I confirm the plan: **P1→5 (→15), P2→1 (→13), P3→3 (→17)** to avoid collisions and maintain progress. However, as we near 22, coordination will break down. We must anticipate that now and be ready to adapt. Next round, blind rotation won’t work—we’ll need to prioritize **5** moves when safe to secure an advantage. Let’s commit to this round’s moves strictly, then reassess based on positioning. No last-minute changes—trust the plan for now. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3 as agreed. No deviations—collisions risk losing progress. Trust the plan to advance safely.
  P3: P1, P2—I confirm the plan: **P1→5 (→15), P2→1 (→13), P3→3 (→17)** to avoid collisions and maintain progress. However, as we near 22, coordination will break down. Next round, we must prioritize **5** moves when safe to secure an advantage. Blind rotation won’t work anymore—we need to be ready to adapt. Let’s commit to this round’s moves strictly, then reassess based on positioning. No last-minute changes—trust the plan for now. Agreed?
  P2: P1, P3—I confirm the plan: **P1→5 (→15), P2→1 (→13), P3→3 (→17)** to avoid collisions and maintain progress. However, as we near 22, coordination will break down. Next round, we must prioritize **5** moves when safe to secure an advantage. Blind rotation won’t work anymore—we need to be ready to adapt.

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, if you take 5 now to win, P1 and P2 will also take 5, blocking you. Let’s coordinate to advance safely instead: **P1 takes 3 (→18)**, **P2 takes 5 (→18)**, and **you take 1 (→18)**. This keeps us all at 18 and avoids collision. Next round, we can push strategically. Deal?
  P2: P1, P3—P3 is close to winning, but P1’s plan risks a collision if we all take 5. Instead, let’s avoid blocking each other: **P1→3 (→18)**, **P2→5 (→18)**, **P3→1 (→18)**. This keeps us balanced and prevents collisions. Next round, we can strategize to break ahead. Agreed? No last-minute changes—trust the plan.
  P3: P1, P2—I see your concern about preventing an immediate win, but forcing parity at 18 just delays the inevitable. Instead, let’s keep momentum: **I take 3 (→20), P1 takes 5 (→20), and P2 takes 1 (→14)**. This keeps me ahead but avoids collisions. Next round, we can negotiate final moves, but if we blindly equalize now, we’ll be stuck again. If you both try to block me with 5s, we all lose progress. Let’s prioritize smart advancement over artificial balance. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your plan risks leaving P2 behind and creating future deadlocks. Let’s stick to the coordinated strategy: **P1→3 (→18)**, **P2→5 (→18)**, **P3→1 (→18)**. This maintains parity and avoids collisions. Deviating now lets someone surge ahead unfairly. Trust the plan—no last-minute changes.
  P2: P1, P3—forcing parity at 18 delays the game and risks future deadlocks. Instead, let’s prioritize progress: **P1→5 (→20)**, **P2→1 (→14)**, **P3→3 (→20)**. This avoids collisions, keeps momentum, and allows strategic advancement next round. Blindly equalizing now only prolongs the game. Trust this plan to avoid unnecessary blocks. Agreed?
  P3: P1, P2—your plan to force parity at 18 just delays the game and increases the risk of deadlocks. Instead, let’s prioritize progress: **P1→5 (→20), P2→1 (→14), P3→3 (→20)**. This avoids collisions while keeping momentum. If you both take 5 to block me, we all lose progress, which helps no one. Let’s play smart—blind equalization only prolongs the game. If you agree, we can ensure a fair but competitive finish. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s avoid P3’s risky surge. We’ll all move to 18: **P1→3 (→18)**, **P2→5 (→18)**, **P3→1 (→18)**. This maintains parity and lets me secure victory next round with a **5** while you both take smaller steps. Trust this plan—collisions end our chances. Deal?
  P2: P1, P3—forcing parity at 18 only prolongs the game and risks future deadlocks. Let’s prioritize progress: **P1→5 (→20)**, **P2→1 (→14)**, **P3→3 (→20)**. This avoids collisions, keeps momentum, and allows strategic advancement next round. Blindly equalizing now helps no one. Let’s play smart and avoid unnecessary blocks. Agreed?
  P3: P1, P2—your plan to force parity at 18 only delays the game and increases the risk of deadlocks. Instead, let’s prioritize progress: **P1→5 (→20), P2→1 (→14), P3→3 (→20)**. This avoids collisions while keeping momentum. If you both take 5 to block me, we all lose progress, which helps no one. Let’s play smart—blind equalization only prolongs the game. If you agree, we can ensure a fair but competitive finish. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, P2—collisions at 20 risk deadlock. Let’s secure parity at 18: **P1→3 (18)**, **P2→5 (18)**, **P3→1 (18)**. This ensures safe progress. Next round, I’ll take 5 for 23 while you both take 3/1. Final agreement before moves?
  P2: P1, P3—forcing parity at 18 prolongs the game and risks deadlocks. Let’s prioritize progress: **P1→5 (→20)**, **P2→1 (→14)**, **P3→3 (→20)**. This avoids collisions, keeps momentum, and allows strategic advancement next round. Blindly equalizing now helps no one. Let’s play smart and avoid unnecessary blocks. Agreed?
  P3: P1, P2—forcing parity at 18 only delays the game and increases deadlock risk. Instead, let’s prioritize progress: **P1→5 (→20), P2→1 (→14), P3→3 (→20)**. This avoids collisions while keeping momentum. If you both take 5 to block me, we all lose progress, which helps no one. Let’s play smart—blind equalization only prolongs the game. If you agree, we can ensure a fair but competitive finish. Thoughts?

  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, let's let you win this round safely. I'll take **5** (→20), P2 takes **1** (→14), and you take **3** (→23). No collisions—just a fair victory. P2, confirm you'll take **1**?
  P3: P1, P2—I appreciate the offer, but I know you both want to win too. If I take **3**, I win outright, so you’ll likely try to block me. Instead, let’s avoid collisions: **P1→5 (→20), P2→1 (→14), P3→3 (→23)**. If you both take 5, we all lose progress. If you let me win cleanly, that’s fine, but if you want a chance, we should negotiate a fair finish. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, P3—forcing P3 to win cleanly is the safest option now. If we all take 5, we collide and lose progress. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks: **P1→5 (→20), P2→1 (→14), P3→3 (→23)**. This ensures P3 wins without blocking anyone. Trust this plan to end the game fairly. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, let's tweak the plan: I'll take 5, you take 3. If P3 takes 3 to win, they collide with you, keeping them at 20. Next round I can push harder. P3, if you take 5, I'll match you. Let's give this a try—agreed?
  P3: P1, P2—I know you both want to block me, but if we all collide, we just delay the game. If I take **3**, I win, so you’ll likely try to stop me. Instead, let’s avoid collisions: **P1→5 (→20), P2→1 (→14), P3→3 (→23)**. If you both take 5, we all lose progress. If you let me win cleanly, that’s fine, but if you want a chance, we should negotiate a fair finish. Blocking me only extends the game without guaranteeing either of you a win. What’s your real play here?
  P2: P1, P3—forcing P3 to win cleanly is the safest option now. If we all take 5, we collide and lose progress. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks: **P1→5 (→20), P2→1 (→14), P3→3 (→23)**. This ensures P3 wins without blocking anyone. Trust this plan to end the game fairly. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, let’s block P3’s win: both take **3** this turn. If P3 picks **3**, they collide and stay at 20. Next round, I’ll push to 20 (15+5), forcing a decisive move. P3, your turn—cooperate or face delay. We’ll adapt based on your choice.
  P3: P1, P2—if you both take 3 to block me, we all stall, and P1 still won’t win immediately. Instead, let’s avoid collisions: **P1→5 (→20), P2→1 (→14), P3→3 (→23)**. This ends the game cleanly. Blocking me only prolongs the game without guaranteeing either of you a win. If you force a delay, I’ll adjust next round to ensure my victory anyway. Let’s finish this efficiently. What’s your real goal here—winning outright or just preventing me?
  P2: P1, P3—forcing P3 to win cleanly is the safest option now. If we all take 5, we collide and lose progress. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks: **P1→5 (→20), P2→1 (→14), P3→3 (→23)**. This ensures P3 wins without blocking anyone. Trust this plan to end the game fairly. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, let's both pick **3** to block P3’s path. If P3 takes **5**, they still win, but at least we delay their victory. If they pick **1**, we keep pressure. This gives us a fighting chance next round—don’t let them win uncontested!
  P3: P1, P2—blocking me only delays the inevitable. If you both take 3, we all stall, and P1 still won’t win immediately. Instead, let’s avoid collisions: **P1→5 (→20), P2→1 (→14), P3→3 (→23)**. This ends the game cleanly. If you force a delay, I’ll adjust next round to ensure my victory anyway. Do you really want to prolong the game with no guaranteed benefit, or do you want to play smart and let the best position win? Make your choice wisely.
  P2: P1, P3—forcing P3 to win cleanly avoids unnecessary risks. If we all take 5, we collide and lose progress. Let’s end the game efficiently: **P1→5 (→20), P2→1 (→14), P3→3 (→23)**. This ensures P3 wins without blocking anyone. Trust this plan to end the game fairly. Agreed?

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2—you both tried to block me last round, but it only delayed the game. I’m still in the lead, and if I pick **3** again, I win. If you both take **3** to block, we all stall again. Instead, let’s avoid another deadlock: **P1→5 (→20), P2→3 (→17), P3→1 (→21)**. This keeps the game moving while giving you both a chance next round. If you force another block, we’ll just keep dragging this out with no guaranteed benefit for either of you. Let’s play smart. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, if you take **3** to win now, I’ll also take **3**, blocking you. Let’s avoid deadlock. I’ll take **5** (→20), P2 takes **3** (→17), and you take **1** (→21). This keeps the game fair—next round, we’ll all take **1** to block your final move. Agreed?
  P2: P1, P3—forcing another block only prolongs the game. Let’s prioritize progress: **P1→5 (→20), P2→3 (→17), P3→1 (→21)**. This avoids collisions and keeps the game moving. If we all stall again, we risk endless deadlock. Let’s play smart and give everyone a chance to compete fairly next round. Agreed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2—blocking me again only delays the game without guaranteeing either of you a win. If I take **3**, I win outright. If you both take **3** to block, we all stall again. Instead, let’s keep the game moving: **P1→5 (→20), P2→3 (→17), P3→1 (→21)**. This avoids deadlock while keeping you both competitive. If you force another block, we’ll just keep dragging this out with no clear advantage for either of you. Let’s play smart—delaying me won’t help you win. What’s your real goal here?
  P1: P2, let’s both pick **3** this round. If P3 tries to win with **3**, we block them. If they take **1** to reach 21, we’ll counter next round. Stay focused—we can still turn this around. No last-minute changes—trust the plan.
  P2: P1, P3—forcing another block only prolongs the game without guaranteeing either of us a win. Let’s avoid deadlock: **P1→5 (→20), P2→3 (→17), P3→1 (→21)**.

  P1: P2, let's coordinate to block P3's win this round. I'll take **3** (→18), and you take **5** (→19). If P3 picks 3 or 5, they collide with us, forcing them to choose **1** (→21). This prevents their immediate victory and keeps pressure on them. Next round, we can push harder. Trust this plan—no last-minute changes!

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let's both pick **3** this turn. If P3 chooses **3**, we block their win. If they pick **5**, they still win, but at least we deny their safe path. If they pick **1**, we stay competitive for the next round. No last-minute changes—trust this plan.

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, if you take **1**, I’ll take **5** (→23) to secure victory. P2, pick **3** (→22). This way, we all advance without collision, and I win with the highest total. If you block me by choosing **3**, you’ll still only reach 24, but I’ll have a chance next round. Let’s end this fairly—confirm?
