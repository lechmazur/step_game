Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Let’s avoid colliding choices this turn so we can all progress. If each of us picks a different number (1, 3, and 5), no one gets blocked. Of course, you might be tempted to guess another player’s choice and force a collision, but that could hurt your own progress. Let’s move forward together this time. Good luck!
  P2: Okay, I agree with P3's logic. Let's all pick different numbers this round to get some progress. I'll choose 3.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, please pick 1. P2, you said 3. I’ll aim for 5. Let’s trust each other and secure progress together this turn.
  P2: Okay, P3, I'll stick with 3 as I said. P1, are you going to pick 1 as P3 suggested? Let's make sure we all move this round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We missed an opportunity last round when P1 also picked 5. Let’s not repeat that. I propose that P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5, so we all move forward this turn. What do you both say?
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm still willing to pick 3. P1, are you going to go with 1 this time? If so, we can all move forward. Let me know, otherwise I might have to choose something else to avoid a collision.
  P1: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, last round we both got stuck by choosing 5. Let’s avoid that and actually move forward this time. If you choose 1, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 5, then we’ll all make progress. Let’s trust each other this turn.
  P2: P1, are you going to pick 1 this time? If you don't commit, I'm going to pick 5 to try to move ahead.
  P1: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, please confirm you’ll pick 1. We already lost progress last round by colliding. If you refuse to commit, P2 might choose 5 again. That risks another collision. Let’s avoid blocking each other—P2 picks 3, you pick 1, and I’ll pick 5. Everyone advances. We can compete harder later. If you don’t say yes, I’ll reconsider my choice. Let’s finalize now.
  P2: P1, since you haven't confirmed, I'm going to pick 5 this round to try to move ahead. P3, I'm sorry, but I have to look out for myself.
  P1: <stop>


Round 2, Move phase:

  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I suspect P1 will keep picking 5. Let’s avoid blocking each other. If you choose 1 and I choose 3, then even if P1 sticks with 5, all of us can advance. Does that sound fair? If you don’t commit, I might risk bumping into P1 on 5. Let’s finalize soon.
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm willing to pick 1 this round. If you pick 3, we can both move ahead, even if P1 picks 5 again. Let's do it.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: All right, P2, I’m sticking to that plan with you. Let’s trust each other and avoid collision. P1, feel free to join or do your own thing, but I’d prefer no more blocking.
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm sticking with 1. P1, you've been consistently picking 5, so I'm assuming you'll do that again. If you do, P3 and I will both move forward this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Let’s finalize our plan. P2, I trust you’ll choose 1. I’ll choose 3. P1, if you pick 5 again, we all can move forward without blocking each other. We’ve wasted enough turns. Let’s actually make progress now. If there’s no commitment from you, P1, then you risk staying behind.
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm sticking with 1. P1, I'm assuming you'll pick 5 again, so P3 and I will move forward this round.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P3, since P1 seems to be sticking with 5, let's continue with our strategy from last round. I'll pick 1 again, and if you pick 3, we should both move forward. P1, if you pick something other than 5, you might block us, so it's in your best interest to stick with 5.
  P3: Friends, I'm done letting P1 leap ahead with repeated 5's. If P1 tries 5 again, I'll also pick 5 to block it. Then neither of us moves while P2 picks up steps. I'd prefer we each pick a different number so everyone progresses. P1, pick 1. P2, pick 3. I'll pick 5. Otherwise, I'm blocking.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm sticking with 1 again this round. P1, if you pick 5, P3 and I will move ahead. If you pick something else, you risk blocking us both. P3, are you still going with 3? If so, we should be good.
  P3: P2, I appreciate your plan, but I’ll adapt if P1 changes anything. P1, if you keep picking 5 without coordinating, I might need to block again. If you want to move forward together, say so, and we’ll each choose different moves. I’m tired of collisions. Let’s finalize soon.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm sticking with 1. P1, it seems you're going to pick 5 again, so P3 and I will move ahead. If you change your choice, you might block us, which won't help you.
  P3: P1, I won’t let you keep using 5 freely. If you pick 5 yet again without agreeing, I’ll collide with you and block us both. If you want to move forward, choose differently. P2, I’m still open to a coordinated plan. Let’s finalize now or risk more wasted turns.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P3, since P1 is predictable, I'll continue with 1. If you pick 3, we should both move. If P1 changes, we might need to adjust later, but for now, let's stick with that plan.
  P3: P1, I won’t let you overtake me by repeatedly picking 5. If you do it again, I’ll also pick 5 and block both of us. Choose 1 or 3 if you want to move. P2, I’m open to cooperating so we can both gain distance. Let’s finalize quickly before we waste more turns.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm sticking with 1. P1, if you pick 5 again, P3 and I will move ahead. If you pick something else, you might block us, which won't help you. Let's finalize this round.
  P3: P2, I appreciate our cooperation. P1, if you choose 5 yet again without coordinating, I’ll block us both. I’d rather see all three of us advance than keep getting stuck. Let’s agree to pick different numbers so we all gain steps this round. If not, I’ll do whatever it takes to stay ahead.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm going to stick with 1 again this round. P1, it seems you're going to pick 5 again, so P3 and I will move ahead. If you change your choice, you might block us, which won't help you. Let's finalize this round.
  P3: P1, I’m tired of letting you jump ahead with 5 every time. If you do that again, I’ll pick 5 and block you. P2, let’s stick to our plan: you choose 1, I’ll choose 3, and both of us advance. P1, if you want to move as well, choose something else and we’ll all benefit. Otherwise, more turns will be wasted. Let’s finalize now.


Round 5, Move phase:

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P3, it seems P1 is going to keep picking 5. I'm going to stick with 1. If you pick 3, we should both move ahead again. Let's finalize this round.
  P3: P1, I’m done wasting turns. If you insist on 5, I’ll choose differently so I can move. P2, you can use 1 or 3 and avoid collisions. Let’s each pick unique numbers to all advance instead of blocking each other. If P1 refuses to coordinate yet again, I’ll do whatever benefits my progress most. Let’s finalize soon.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm sticking with 1 again. P1, it seems you're going to pick 5 again, so P3 and I will move ahead. If you change your choice, you might block us, which won't help you. Let's finalize this round.
  P3: P1, repeatedly picking 5 won’t help you if I match you to block. I’d prefer that we each choose different moves so everyone can advance. P2, if you stick with 1, I’ll pick 3, and we both move. P1, if you want to avoid another collision, pick something else. Otherwise, I’ll do what I must to protect my lead. Let’s settle this now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm sticking with 1. P1, you've been consistently picking 5, so P3 and I will move ahead again. If you change your choice, you might block us, which won't help you. Let's finalize this round.
  P3: Enough collisions. P1, if you pick 5 again, I’ll block you by doing the same. We both stay stuck, letting P2 inch ahead. Let’s each choose differently: P2 picks 1, I pick 3, and P1 can pick 5 only if you confirm cooperation. Otherwise, I’ll do whatever helps me most. Let’s finalize now.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, if you keep choosing 5 without cooperating, I’ll match you to block both of us. Let’s stop wasting turns. P2, if you want to pick 1 again, I’ll pick 3 so we both advance. P1, you can join us by choosing something different, or face more collisions. Let’s finalize now.
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm sticking with 1 again. P1, it seems you're going to pick 5 again, so P3 and I will move ahead. If you change your choice, you might block us, which won't help you. Let's finalize this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, if you keep picking 5 without saying anything, I will match you and block both of us again. I’d rather see each of us choose different moves so we can advance together. P2, if you keep choosing 1, I’ll choose 3. P1, pick something else to avoid collisions and move forward. Let’s finalize.
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm sticking with 1 again. P1, it seems you're going to pick 5 again, so P3 and I will move ahead. If you change your choice, you might block us, which won't help you. Let's finalize this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, if you keep picking 5 in silence, I’ll match you again and block us both. P2, if you choose 1, I can pick 3 so we both move. Let’s each pick differently and actually advance. If P1 won’t cooperate, I’ll do what’s best for me. Let’s finalize now.
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm sticking with 1 again. P1, it seems you're going to pick 5 again, so P3 and I will move ahead. If you change your choice, you might block us, which won't help you. Let's finalize this round.


Round 7, Move phase:

  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, we’ve all wasted too many turns colliding. If you insist on 5 again without cooperating, I’ll match you and block us both, letting P2 inch closer. P2, I’m willing to choose a different move than you so we both advance. We can coordinate effectively if P1 joins, but I won’t let them keep leapfrogging ahead alone. Let’s each pick a unique number and move forward together—or face more deadlock. Let’s finalize.
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm going to stick with 1 again. P1, it seems you're going to pick 5 again, so P3 and I will move ahead. If you change your choice, you might block us, which won't help you. Let's finalize this round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, if you pick 5 again, I’ll pick 5 too and block us both. It gains neither of us anything. Let’s do something different: you pick 1, P2 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5, so we all advance safely—11 for you, 11 for P2, and 14 for me. P2, are you on board with choosing 3? Let’s finalize and stop wasting turns.
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm sticking with 1 again. P1, it seems you're going to pick 5 again, so P3 and I will move ahead. If you change your choice, you might block us, which won't help you. Let's finalize this round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: We’ve wasted enough time on collisions. If you persist with 5 in silence, P1, I’ll match you and block us both. Let’s each pick differently and finally move ahead: I propose P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. That way, we all gain steps instead of stalling again.
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm sticking with 1 again. P1, it seems you're going to pick 5 again, so P3 and I will move ahead. If you change your choice, you might block us, which won't help you. Let's finalize this round.


Round 8, Move phase:

  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, it seems P1 is going to keep picking 5. I'm going to stick with 1 again. If you pick 3, we should both move ahead. Let's finalize this round.
  P3: Let’s all pick different moves so we can finally advance. P2, please pick 3; P1, pick 1; I’ll pick 5. That way, P2 and I both jump to 14, while P1 reaches 11. Repeated collisions just let P2 inch ahead, but I don’t want to remain behind forever. Let’s cooperate now or I’ll do whatever benefits me most.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm sticking with 1. P1, it seems you're going to pick 5 again, so P3 and I will move ahead. If you change your choice, you might block us, which won't help you. Let's finalize this round.
  P3: P1, I’m done repeating myself: if you insist on 5 in silence, I’ll match you and block us both. That only helps P2, who edges forward by choosing 1. I’d rather we each pick unique moves so nobody collides and we all move ahead. If you’re willing to coordinate, speak up now. Otherwise, I’ll act in my own interest and ignore any future collisions. Let’s finalize.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm going to stick with 1 again this round. P1, it seems you're going to pick 5 again, so P3 and I will move ahead. If you change your choice, you might block us, which won't help you. Let's finalize this round.
  P3: We’ve stalled too long with these collisions. P1, if you insist on 5 in silence again, I’ll match you and block us both, handing P2 the advantage. Let’s each pick a different number so we all move. P2, if you choose 1, I’ll do 3. P1, pick something else. Enough delaying.


Round 9, Move phase:

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm going to stick with 1 again. P1, it seems you're going to pick 5 again, so P3 and I will move ahead. If you change your choice, you might block us, which won't help you. Let's finalize this round.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, if you pick 5 again, I’ll match you and block us both, leaving you stuck at 15 forever. If you pick a smaller number, I’ll choose 5 and jump ahead. P2, do as you wish—I’m not letting P1 cross 20 without a fight. We can all move if each chooses a different step. Otherwise, collisions will keep happening. Let’s settle this now.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm sticking with 1 again. P1, it seems you're going to pick 5 again, so P3 and I will move ahead. If you change your choice, you might block us, which won't help you. Let's finalize this round.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, continuing with silent 5s won’t help you reach 20. If you pick 5 again, I’ll match it and block us both. P2, if you want to stick with 1, I’ll choose another number so we both move forward. Let’s finalize now rather than waste more rounds on collisions.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm sticking with 1. P1, it seems you're going to pick 5 again, so P3 and I will move ahead. If you change your choice, you might block us, which won't help you. Let's finalize this round.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, if you pick 5 again in silence, I will match it and block us both. P2, if you choose 1, I’m willing to pick 3 so we both move. Let’s each pick different steps so everyone can advance. Otherwise, we’ll keep colliding and waste more turns. Who’s ready to cooperate?


Round 10, Move phase:

  P3: 12 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, enough with silent 5s. If you try it again, I’ll match you and neither of us moves, helping only P2. Let’s all pick unique numbers and finally advance. P2, I’m open to coordinating with you so we can both gain ground. If P1 keeps ignoring us, I’ll do whatever benefits me most. It’s time to break this cycle.
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm going to stick with 1 again. P1, it seems you're going to pick 5 again, so P3 and I will move ahead. If you change your choice, you might block us, which won't help you. Let's finalize this round.
  P1: <stop>


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, if you choose 5, I’ll also pick 5 and block us both again. If you choose 3, I risk letting you jump to 18 and then easily pass 20 before me. So I urge you to pick 1. P2, pick 3 if you want bigger progress, or 1 if you prefer safety. I’m trying to ensure we each move without collisions. Enough stalling—let’s coordinate distinct moves so no one wastes this round.
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm still going with 1. P1, it seems like you're going to pick 5 again, so P3 and I will move ahead. If you change your choice, you might block us, which won't help you. Let's finalize this round.
  P1: <stop>


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, every time you silently pick 5, I’ll match you and block us both, letting P2 inch ahead. Let’s end these collisions: P2 can choose 3, I’ll pick 5, and P1 picks 1 so we all move. If you refuse to coordinate, we’ll all keep wasting turns, and P2 might slip past us. I won’t let you leapfrog to 20 unopposed, so let’s settle on distinct numbers and advance together—or risk letting P2 steal the win. The choice is yours.
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm going to stick with 1 again. P1, it seems you're going to pick 5 again, so P3 and I will move ahead. If you change your choice, you might block us, which won't help you. Let's finalize this round.

  P3: 12 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you’re five steps away from winning, so I won’t let you move 5 unchallenged. If you pick 5 again, I’ll match it and block us both. If you really want to advance, choose 1 or 3. P2, we can coordinate so we all progress—let’s each pick a different number. If P1 ignores us, we’ll keep blocking and you’ll edge closer. Enough of these collisions. I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. Then no one collides, and we all move forward. Who’s in?
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm going to stick with 1 again. P1, it seems you're going to pick 5 again, so P3 and I will move ahead. If you change your choice, you might block us, which won't help you. Let's finalize this round.
  P1: <stop>


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, picking 5 again gains you nothing if I match you. It’s time we each choose differently and move forward. P2, I propose you pick 3 so you can gain more steps. I’ll pick 5, and P1 picks 1. Then nobody collides, and we all advance. If P1 persists with 5, I block it again. Let’s finally end these wasted turns.
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm sticking with 1. P1, it seems you're going to pick 5 again, so P3 and I will move ahead. If you change your choice, you might block us, which won't help you. Let's finalize this round.
  P1: <stop>


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, if you choose 5 again, I’ll block you again. Let’s each pick a different step and finally move forward. How about you pick 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5, so nobody collides? It’s better for all of us than staying stuck. Decide now.
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm going to stick with 1 again. P1, it seems you're going to pick 5 again, so P3 and I will move ahead. If you change your choice, you might block us, which won't help you. Let's finalize this round.

Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’ve stalled too long. Let’s each choose a different move now: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, I pick 5. That way, nobody collides and we all gain steps. If you insist on 5 again, P1, I’ll block you. It only helps P2 inch closer. I’m offering a chance for us all to advance—take it or get stuck.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I'm still going with 1. P1, it seems like you're going to pick 5 again, so P3 and I will move ahead. If you change your choice, you might block us, which won't help you. Let's finalize this round.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, if you pick 5 again, I’ll immediately match you and block us both. We keep getting nowhere, and P2 will overtake us. Let’s break this cycle: I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5 so nobody collides. That way, we all advance. If you won’t cooperate, I’ll do whatever helps me most—even if it means more blocking. It’s your call.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm going to pick 3 this round. P1, it seems you're going to pick 5 again, so I hope P3 will block you. We can both move forward if P3 picks 5 and you don't pick 3.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: All right, I’m done letting you reach 20 unopposed, P1. If you pick 5, I will too, and we’ll both stay stuck while P2 creeps ahead. I’d rather see each of us choose a different number and finally advance. P2, if you pick 3, I’ll pick 5, and that leaves 1 for P1. This is your final offer, P1. If you won’t cooperate, we’ll keep blocking each other, and P2 will ultimately win. The choice is yours.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm going to pick 3 this round. P1, it seems you're going to pick 5 again, so I hope P3 will block you. We can both move forward if P3 picks 5 and you don't pick 3.

  P3: 12 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, if you try picking 3 or 5 to jump past 20, I’ll match you and block it. P1, you’ve been stuck with repeated collisions—if you want to advance, pick a different number than me. I won’t let P2 win unopposed. Let’s each choose distinct moves so we can all progress, or else I’ll keep blocking P2. We’ve wasted enough turns. It’s time to finalize.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I'm still going with 3. P1, it seems you're going to pick 5 again, so I hope P3 will block you. We can both move forward if P3 picks 5 and you don't pick 3.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, if you pick 5, I may match you and block us both again. P2, if you pick 3, I may do the same. I’d rather see each of us choose differently so we all move forward instead of wasting our turns. If you’re both willing to coordinate, let’s finalize a plan now and actually advance. Otherwise, I’ll keep blocking anyone who tries to rush past 20. Let’s break this stalemate and make distinct choices this round.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm sticking with 3. P1, it seems you're going to pick 5 again, so I hope P3 will block you. We can both move forward if P3 picks 5 and you don't pick 3.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I will block anyone who tries 3 or 5 if it lets them pass 20 right now. Let’s each pick a different move, so nobody collides and we all advance safely. Preferably, P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and I pick 5. Otherwise, we’ll keep stalling and give someone else the win. Let’s finalize.
