Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's avoid collisions and try to coordinate. Who wants to go for 1 this round?
  P3: I'll go for 5 this round, but I'm open to adjusting if we can come to a coordination agreement that benefits me. What are P2's thoughts?
  P2: P3, if you're going for 5, I can go for 3, and P1 can go for 1. That way, we all advance this round. P1, does that work for you?

Positions now:

  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given our current positions, I suggest we maintain a staggered approach to minimize collisions. P1, you're at 1 step, so going for 3 this round could work well. P2, at 3 steps, aiming for 5 could be your next move. As for me, at 5 steps, I'm considering going for 5 again to maintain my lead. What are your thoughts on this strategy?
  P2: P3, your plan sounds reasonable. I'll go for 5 if P1 agrees to go for 3. P1, does that work for you?
  P1: I'm okay with going for 3 this round. P2, are you committed to 5?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Since P1 and P2 seem to be on board with the staggered approach, I'll reaffirm my intention to go for 5 this round, aiming to extend my lead. Let's stick to the plan and avoid collisions.
  P2: P1, since you're going for 3 and I'm going for 5, let's stick to this plan to avoid any collisions. P3, you're going for 5 as well, right? Let's ensure we all advance.
  P1: P2, P3, sticking to the plan sounds good to me.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, since we're tied, I propose we alternate going for 5 each round.  That way we can both guarantee advancement without collisions. Who's in?
  P3: P1, your proposal for alternating 5s sounds like it benefits you and P2, but I'm already in the lead with 10 steps. I'm not interested in giving up my advantage by waiting for a turn to go for 5. I'll continue to play aggressively to maintain my lead. P2, will you follow P1's suggestion or prioritize your own advancement?
  P2: P1, I see your point about alternating 5s, but with P3 already ahead, we need to catch up strategically. P3, since you're playing aggressively, how about we both go for 3 this round to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you're going for 5, I'll go for 1. P2, will you join us in this strategy?
  P3: P1, P2, since I'm already ahead, I'll continue with my aggressive strategy. I'll go for 5 this round. P2, if you go for 3 as you suggested earlier, that would work well for both of us to avoid collisions. P1, going for 1 might not be the best use of your turn, considering you need to catch up.
  P2: P1, let's try to catch up with P3. If you're going for 1, I'll go for 3 this round. P3, if you're sticking with 5, let's avoid any collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I'll go for 5.  P3, if you go for 1, we can both advance.
  P3: P1, you've changed your mind to go for 5. Given that, P2, it might be wise for you to stick with 3 to avoid a collision with P1. As for me, I'll maintain my plan to go for 5, aiming to further extend my lead.
  P2: P1, P3, let's avoid collisions. P1, if you're set on 5, I'll go for 3. P3, you can go for 1 to ensure we all advance. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, if you go for 1, P2 and I will go for 5.  We can both catch up.  What do you say?
  P3: P1, P2, I see you're both trying to catch up. Given my lead, I'll stick to my plan and go for 5. If you both go for 5 as well, we'll collide and none of us will advance. I suggest one of you goes for 3 and the other for 1 to avoid this.
  P2: P1, I'll go for 3 this round. P3, if you're sticking with 5, let's avoid collisions. P1, if you go for 1, we can all advance.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the current state, I'll continue to prioritize extending my lead. P1, since you collided with me last round, going for 1 this round might be a safe choice for you. P2, you're at 7 steps, so aiming for 3 could work well to avoid collisions and keep advancing. As for me, I'm considering going for 5 again to maintain my aggressive strategy. What are your thoughts?
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy to maintain your lead by going for 5. P1, if you go for 1, I'll go for 3, and we can both advance without colliding with P3. Let's coordinate to make sure we all move forward this round.
