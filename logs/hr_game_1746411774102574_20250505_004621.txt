Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. If we each choose different numbers this round, we all advance. I suggest we pick 1, 3, and 5 without overlap. Agree?
  P3: I agree coordination is smart. If we all pick different numbers, everyone advances without wasting a turn on collisions. Since this is the first round and we're all at zero, I don't have a strong preference. Maybe we should discuss who takes which number? I'm flexible, but taking larger steps early could be advantageous.
  P1: I propose we assign unique picks: I (P1) take 5, P2 take 3, P3 take 1. That avoids any collision and gets us all moving. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed. Let's proceed with P1's proposal: P1-5, me-3, P3-1. No overlaps this round ensures we all gain ground. Consistency now builds trust for future coordination. Let's confirm and move.
  P3: I'll take 1 for this round as proposed. However, for fairness, I suggest we rotate our numbers in future rounds (I take 3 next round, then 5, etc.) so nobody gets stuck with the smallest steps consistently. This rotation system would be equitable long-term and still avoid collisions. Does that sound reasonable to everyone?
  P1: Agreed, P3—rotation sounds fair. How about we lock in this same lineup for Round 2 as well (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1), then begin the rotation in Round 3? That way we all get two smooth advances before switching. Fair?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s lock in our plan for Round 2: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, then we begin the rotation in Round 3. Please confirm so we can move on.
  P3: I'm concerned about the fairness of that plan. P1 would be at 10 steps, P2 at 6, and I'd be at only 2 after Round 2. I think we should start the rotation now. Since we all agreed rotation is fair, let's implement it immediately:
- P1 takes 1 (rotating from 5)
- P2 takes 5 (rotating from 3)
- P3 (me) takes 3 (rotating from 1)

This maintains our collision-free approach while ensuring no player gets repeatedly disadvantaged.
  P2: P3's rotation plan ensures fair progress. P1, if you take 1 this round, we all advance collision-free. Delaying rotation risks your lead being challenged via future collisions. Let’s adopt P3’s rotation now: P1=1, me=5, P3=3. This keeps the game balanced and trust intact. Stalling could push P3 or me to deviate, risking your 5. Compromise now for smooth coordination.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m not taking 1 this round. I’ll pick 5 no matter what—if you force me to 1, I’ll still play 5 and trigger a collision, stalling us both. Let’s stick to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for Round 2, then begin rotation in Round 3. Confirm or expect a collision.
  P3: I see P1's threat is clear. While I don't appreciate being forced into the smaller number again, a collision benefits nobody and especially hurts those of us behind. P2, I'll take 1 this round to avoid the collision, but we need to address this power imbalance soon. P1 will be far ahead, and we'll need a strategy to prevent them from dominating. Let's proceed cautiously this round, then reconsider our options.
  P2: **P3**, let's pivot: If you take **3** this round, I'll take **5** to collide with P1's 5. You gain +3 (to 4), halting P1's lead. Next round, we rotate fairly (you take 5, me 1, P1 3?). This balances progress and curbs P1's dominance. Trust me—mutual gain.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’ll pick 5, P2 you pick 3, P3 pick 1—no collisions and we all advance. P2, if you go for 5 to hit me you stay at 3 and hand P3 the lead at 4. P3, picking 3 invites that exact collision; 1 is safest. We stick to 5–3–1 now and I’ll honor rotation in Round 3. Confirm or face a stall.
  P3: I'm concerned about P1's growing lead. The 5-3-1 pattern puts me at a severe disadvantage, and P1 could reach 15 steps after just 3 rounds. While P2's collision strategy is risky, I need to consider it. 

P1, your threat tactics aren't building trust. P2, I appreciate your willingness to balance the game. I'll carefully consider both options and make my move accordingly. Either way, we need a fair system moving forward that doesn't consistently disadvantage any player.
  P2: P3: Take 3. I will take 5 to collide with P1, halting their lead. You gain +3, reaching 4. Next round, you take 5, me 1, P1 3. Fair rotation. Immediate action needed—trust this balance.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm now in the lead! Last round showed we need cooperation, not threats. Let's implement the rotation we discussed for fairness:
- P3 (me): 5
- P1: 3
- P2: 1

This follows our original rotation principle and prevents wasteful collisions. P1, this gives you progress without another collision, and P2, while you take 1 this round, you'll get 5 next round. This balanced approach benefits us all long-term. Shall we proceed?
  P2: **P2:** P3's rotation is fair. P1, taking 3 prevents collision and keeps balance. If you force 5, you risk colliding with P3 (who’ll take 5 per plan), halting your lead. Cooperate now: P3=5, you=3, me=1. We all advance. Stubbornness invites mutual stalls. Let’s build trust.
  P1: P3, I won’t swap to 3—I’ll choose 5 this round. If you insist on 5, we both stall and P2 jumps to 4, which hurts you most. Better for you to take 3 now. P2, take 1 to avoid colliding with P3. We all advance cleanly as 5-3-1 and then begin rotation in Round 4. Otherwise buckle up for a stall.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your threat tactics continue to undermine cooperation. I'm concerned about creating a cycle of mistrust, but I also want us all to advance. Fine - I'll take 3 this round to avoid collision, letting you have 5 one more time. P2, please take 1 as suggested.

But this is the last time. After this round, we MUST implement fair rotation, or I'll be forced to make strategic collisions to prevent runaway leads. Let's agree now on rotation starting next round.
  P2: **P2:** P3: Proceed with 3. I'll take 5 to collide with P1, halting their advance. You gain +3 to 7. Next round, we reset with fair rotation. This stops P1's dominance now. P1, your greed forces this—cooperate or lose.
  P1: P2, your collision plan backfires—you stall at 3 while P3 jumps to 7 and takes the lead. That’s worse for you. P2=3, P3=1 keeps all of us safe. P3, you don’t want P2 colliding with me and letting them dictate the pace. Let’s stick to 5-3-1 this round, then start fair rotation in Round 4 as promised.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm caught between contradictory strategies. P1 wants me to take 3 to avoid collision while P2 wants me to take 3 so they can collide with P1. 

Given these dynamics, I'll take 3 this round. P2, if you're serious about blocking P1's advance with a collision at 5, that would maintain my lead. Either way, I'll advance to 7 steps without risking my own progress.

After this round, we absolutely must implement fair rotation regardless of the outcome.
  P2: **P2:** P3, final call: Take 3. I'll collide with P1's 5, halting their lead. You gain +3 to 7. Next round, enforce rotation. P1, cooperation is your only path—defiance locks you out. Move now or lose.
  P1: P2, if you collide at 5 with me, P3 jumps +3 to 7 and becomes a runaway leader—worse for you than clean play. The only way to avoid handing P3 the win is unique picks: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this round, then we start fair rotation in Round 4. Deviating hands P3 the victory. Are we agreed?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose for Round 4 we use 5–3–1 to shrink P3’s lead:  
• P1=5 → 10 steps  
• P2=3 → 6 steps  
• P3=1 → 8 steps  

Then in Round 5 we begin fair rotation (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). If you won’t take 1 now, I’ll stick with 5 and threaten a 5–5 collision next turn. Let’s avoid stalls and keep everyone advancing.
  P3: As the current leader, I reject P1's proposal that puts me at a disadvantage. I've been forced into smaller numbers for multiple rounds while P1 repeatedly demands the largest steps. 

Here's a fair proposal:
• P3 (me) = 5 → 12 steps
• P1 = 3 → 8 steps
• P2 = 1 → 4 steps

This maintains collision-free play while implementing the rotation principle we all previously agreed on. P1, your continued threats undermine cooperation. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to sacrifice my lead after playing fairly throughout.
  P2: **P2:** P3, take 5 to collide with P1's 5—halting their advance. I'll take 3 to reach 6, keeping you in the lead. Next round, enforce rotation (P3=3, me=5, P1=1). This balances progress and blocks P1's dominance. Trust this strategy for mutual gain.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: 5-3-1 gives us P1→10, P2→6, P3→8.  
P3, take 1 to lock in a 2-step lead. If you take 5 and P2 plays 3, you stay at 7 vs my 10—and a collision stalls you anyway.  
P2, pick 3 to avoid over-boosting P3 or triggering stalls.  
Let’s advance cleanly this round, then start fair rotation in Round 5.
  P3: I won't take 1 and lose my lead after playing fairly for multiple rounds. P1 continues making threats while demanding the largest steps for themselves. 

P2, I appreciate your willingness to balance the game, but a 5-5 collision benefits neither of us. Let's compromise:
• P3 (me) = 3 → 10 steps
• P1 = 1 → 6 steps
• P2 = 5 → 8 steps

This way we all advance and balance power. P1, if you reject this fair plan, I'll be forced to consider P2's collision strategy.
  P2: **P2:** P3's compromise (P3=3, P1=1, me=5) balances progress fairly. P1, refusing 1 forces collision, stalling you while P3 hits 10. Cooperate now: take 1, let’s all advance. Next round, rotate roles (P1=3, me=5, P3=1). Continued defiance risks mutual losses. Choose wisely.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Look P2, do 3 now, P3 takes 1, I take 5: scores become P1=10, P2=6, P3=8. Next round rotation P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 makes us all hit 11 and tie for victory, knocking P3 out. If you back P3’s plan, you get only 8 vs their 12 or more. This tie is your best shot at winning. P3, taking 1 locks in a shared win. Let’s do 5-3-1.
  P3: I recognize P1's proposal leads to a three-way tie, but after carefully considering the game state, I'll take 3 this round. With P1 consistently demanding 5 and making threats, I won't surrender my lead by taking just 1 step.

Let's proceed with:
• Me = 3 → 10 steps
• P1 = 5 → 10 steps
• P2 = 1 → 4 steps

This maintains my competitive position while avoiding collisions. P2, I appreciate your support, but this approach better protects my interests while still allowing everyone to advance.
  P2: **P2:** P3, take 3. I'll take 5 to collide with P1, halting their advance. You reach 10 while P1 stays at 5. Next round, enforce rotation (you=5, me=3, P1=1) to balance progress. This curbs P1's greed and secures your lead. Trust mutual gain over chaos.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 5 plan: I’ll take 5, P2 take 3. P3, your best play is 1—getting you to 11 alongside us. If you pick 3, you stay at 10 while P1 & P2 hit 11; if you pick 5, you collide with me and remain at 10 while P2 reaches 11. Let’s all tie at 11 this round and then rotate fairly in Round 6 (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). Agreed?
  P3: I reject P1's three-way tie proposal. As the current leader, why would I deliberately reduce my advantage? Your suggestion benefits you, not me.

I'll take 3 this round to reach 13 steps, maintaining a clear lead. P1's analysis is incorrect - taking 3 puts me at 13, not keeps me at 10.

Let's proceed with a fair system where the leader isn't pressured to surrender their position. I earned this lead through strategic play in previous rounds.
  P2: **P2:** P1: Take 1. If you pick 5, I'll collide and you stall at 6. P3 will leap to 13. Cooperate now: you reach 7, I hit 13, P3 at 13. Next round, we tie-break. Stubbornness hands P3 the win. Choose wisely.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3: if you pick 3 or 5 you leap to ≥13 and win outright. The only way to stop you is you taking 1.  
P2: pick 3 so I go to 11, you to 11, P3 to 11. We force a three-way tie—no sole winner.  
I’ll pick 5.  
P3, take 1. P2, take 3. Let’s at least keep the game alive together instead of handing P3 the victory now.
  P3: I'll be taking 5 this round to reach 15 steps. As the leader, deliberately tying with both of you isn't in my interest. P2, I appreciate your supportive strategy, but I need to maximize my advantage. P1, your three-way tie proposal benefits you, not me.

If anyone tries to collide with me at 5, you'll only delay your own progress while I'll still maintain my lead. The winning threshold is 22 - I'm playing to win, not tie.
  P2: **P2:** P1: Take 5 to collide with P3’s 5, halting their lead. I’ll take 3 to reach 11. Next round, we coordinate to finish. P3’s 15 would end the game—act now or lose.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I will take 5 this round. P3 has publicly committed to 5—let’s collide and stall him at 10. P2, pick 3 to reach 11 and seize the lead. If you pick 5, we all stall and P3 keeps his advantage into Round 6. The only way to block P3’s win is for you to play 3 now.
  P3: I'm reconsidering my options given your coordination attempts. While I previously mentioned taking 5, that would clearly lead to a collision with P1. My goal is to win, not stall. I'll make a strategic choice that maximizes my lead while considering your likely moves. The game's dynamics have shifted this round, and I'll adapt accordingly. May the best strategist win.
  P2: **P2:** P3: Take 1. If you pick 3, I'll take 3—collision leaves you at 10 while I stall. P1's 5 won't advance. Choose 1: we all hit 11, then rotate. Stalling helps no one. Secure mutual progress now.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** Let's advance without collision: P1=1, me=3, P3=5. P1, taking 5 collides with P3, stalling you both. Cooperate to move cleanly. P3, secure your lead with 5. I'll take 3 to reach 11. Mutual progress or mutual loss—choose wisely.
  P1: I’ll take 5. P2, please take 3—if you take 1, P3 will jump to ≥13 and leave you at 9. P3, take 1 to avoid colliding with my 5 or P2’s 3. That yields clean progress: P1→16, P2→11, P3→11. Any other picks risk someone surging or stalling. Let’s do 5–3–1.
  P3: As the middle player, I need to advance strategically. P1 wants me to take 1 while they take 5, putting them at 16 and me at only 11. That's not in my interest. 

I propose:
• P3 (me): 5 → 15 steps
• P1: 3 → 14 steps
• P2: 1 → 9 steps

This maintains competitive balance and prevents P1 from getting too far ahead. P1, taking 5 risks collision with me, stalling both of us while P2 advances. Let's all make progress instead of forcing collisions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** P3: Take 5 to secure your lead. P1, taking 5 again collides with P3—stalling both. I’ll take 3 to advance. Cooperate or stall each other. If you both pick 5, I gain ground while you lose progress. Let’s avoid mutual destruction. Choose wisely.
  P1: P2, pick 3 to move to 11; P3, pick 1 to also reach 11; I’ll take 5 to hit 16. No collisions, everyone advances. We’ll begin a fair rotation in Round 7. Agreed?
  P3: I remain committed to taking 5 this round. P1, if you also pick 5, we both stall while P2 advances - hurting us both. Taking 3 gives you progress to 14 while avoiding collision. 

P2, we should each pick different numbers to all advance. My taking 5 maintains my competitive position without creating destructive collisions that only benefit whoever isn't involved.

Let's make rational choices that allow everyone to progress.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** I’ll take **3** to reach 11. P1: Take **1** to avoid colliding with P3’s **5**. If you stubbornly pick 5, you’ll stall with P3 while I advance. P3: Secure your lead with 5. Let’s end this round cleanly.
  P1: Let’s avoid collisions this round with unique picks: I’ll take 5, P2 take 3, P3 take 1. That gets us to 16-11-11.  
P3, if you pick 5 you’ll collide with me and stay at 10; if you pick 3 you collide with P2. 1 is the only safe advance.  
P2, 3 avoids any collision and gives you +3.  
We all move forward cleanly and I can likely finish next turn. Otherwise someone stalls and P3 risks pulling away.
  P3: I need to be strategic at this critical point. P1, let's be reasonable - if we both pick 5, we both stall while P2 gains ground. That's mutually destructive.

I'll make my move based on who shows willingness to cooperate. Collisions help nobody except the player not involved. We all benefit from choosing different numbers, and I intend to maximize my position this round.

Let's make moves that allow everyone to advance rather than forcing wasteful stalls.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Proposal: to avoid any stalls, use unique picks: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. That moves us to 16-14-11. Colliding by both picking 5 stalls leaders and lets the third advance unchecked. Don’t pick 5. Agree on 5-3-1 now.
  P3: P1's proposal puts me at a significant disadvantage. After colliding last round, I can't afford to take just 1 step while you take 5. I propose:

• P3 (me) = 3 → 13 steps
• P1 = 1 → 12 steps
• P2 = 5 → 16 steps

This balances our positions better and prevents P1 from dominating. If P1 insists on 5, I'll consider the same to force a collision, benefiting P2 but preventing an insurmountable lead. Let's all advance without reckless collisions.
  P2: **P2:** Let’s all advance: P1=3, me=5, P3=1. No collisions, mutual progress. If you both pick 5, you stall while I gain. Compromise now for shared advancement. Next round, rotate fairly. Defiance risks mutual loss.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, choose 3; P3, choose 1; I’ll pick 5. Unique picks avoid collisions: we’ll move to P1=16, P2=14, P3=11. If P3 picks 3 or 5, you risk colliding or letting P2 jump to 16—worst for you. Clean 5-3-1 gives steady progress and sets up a fair next round. Agreed?
  P3: I'm concerned that P1 is demanding 5 again after our collision. I need substantial progress this round to stay competitive. I propose:

• P3 (me) = 3 → 13 steps
• P1 = 1 → 12 steps 
• P2 = 3 → 14 steps

This preserves balance, prevents runaway leaders, and avoids collisions. P1, taking 5 risks another collision with me. Let's all advance rationally without destructive stalls that only hurt our chances.
  P2: **P2:** Let's all advance: P3=3, me=5, P1=1. No collisions. P3 gains +3 to 13, blocking P1. If P1 insists on 5, they collide and stall, while you secure your position. Mutual progress now keeps the game balanced. Next round, rotate fairly. Defiance risks P1's greed. Choose wisely.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’ll pick 5 to hit 16. P2: pick 3 to reach 14—if you pick 1, P3 takes 5 and jumps to 15, leaving you behind. P3: picking 3 collides with P2, picking 5 collides with me; only 1 safely advances you to 11. Unique picks avoid self-sabotage. Let’s all move with 5-3-1 this round.
  P3: I'll take 3 this round to reach 13 steps. P1, if you continue insisting on 5, we'll likely collide again, benefiting only P2. Taking 1 would be more strategic for you. P2, if you take 5, we all advance without collisions. We're at a critical point where cooperation benefits everyone, while stubborn positioning causes mutual harm. Let's make rational choices that allow everyone to progress.
  P2: **P2:** P3: Take 5 to collide with P1’s 5—halting their advance. I’ll take 3, reaching 14. Next round, enforce fair rotation (you=3, me=5, P1=1). This stops P1’s dominance and keeps the game balanced. Cooperate now for mutual gain.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We need to change our approach. P1 is at 16 steps and will win soon if we don't coordinate. P2, our collision last round hurt us both. Let's work together:

• I'll take 5 → 15 steps
• You take 1 → 12 steps
• P1 should take 3 → 19 steps

This prevents P1 from reaching 22 this round. Next round, we can coordinate again to stop them. If P1 insists on 5, one of us must block them with our own 5. We need strategic alliance now.
  P2: **P2:** P3: Take 3. I'll take 5 to collide if P1 chooses 5. If they pick 3, you both stall. Either way, we block their lead. Next round, we coordinate for mutual gain. Trust this strategy to balance the game.
  P1: I’ll take 3 to reach 19. P2, please take 5 to advance to 16. P3, take 1 to get to 11. Unique choices avoid collisions and let us all move forward. Collisions only stall progress and benefit whoever sits out—let’s keep advancing cleanly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P2's strategy. P1 is close to winning at 16 steps, so we must coordinate. I'll take 3 this round to reach 13, while P2 can take 5 to reach 16. P1, if you insist on 5, you risk collision with P2; taking 3 as you suggested is safer. This approach balances the game and prevents a runaway victory. We all advance, but at a controlled pace that maintains competitive balance.
  P2: **P2:** P3: Take 3. I’ll take 5 to block P1’s 5. If they pick 3, you collide and block them. Either way, we halt their lead. Next round, we ally to overtake. Trust this—mutual survival hinges on stopping P1 now.
  P1: I’ll take 1 this round. P2: take 5; P3: take 3. Unique picks avoid your planned collisions. That puts us at P1=17, P2=16, P3=13 and sets me up to finish next turn. Confirm or risk mutual stalls.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll take 3 this round to reach 13 steps. P2, please maintain your plan to take 5 to reach 16 and potentially block P1 if they try for 5. P1, taking 1 as you last suggested is your safest move. This approach prevents anyone from stalling while balancing competition. The game remains open, and we all make progress.
  P2: **P2:** P3, hold to **3**. If P1 picks **5**, I'll collide with them, halting their lead. If they pick **3**, you collide. Either way, their progress stalls. I take **5** to block or advance. Trust this strategy—mutual action stops P1's victory. Next round, we coordinate for final moves. No more delays.
  P1: I’ll take 1, P2 take 5, P3 take 3. Unique picks avoid stalls and push us to 17-16-13. Any deviation risks a collision that only benefits the outsider. Confirm?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** P3: Let's block P1's win. I'll take 5 to collide if they choose 5, halting them. You take 3 to reach 16. Next round, we coordinate fairly. Trust this mutual defense now—stalling P1 keeps us in the game.
  P3: P1 is close to winning at 17 steps. I'll take 5 this round to reach 18 and take the lead. P2, please maintain your strategy to take 5 and block P1 if they also choose 5. If P1 picks anything other than 5, we all advance but I gain position. With P1 needing just 5 more steps to win, we must act decisively now to prevent their victory and keep the game competitive.
  P1: P2, you’ve said you’ll take 5 to block me.  
P3, you’ve said you’ll take 5 to extend your lead.  

Perfect—both of you can’t take 5 without colliding. I will take 3. You two collide and stall at 16/13 while I jump to 20. Next turn any move wins for me. 

Let’s just play it out:  
P1 = 3 → 20  
P2 = 5 → 16  
P3 = 5 → 13  

Game over.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** P3: Take **3**! If P1 picks 5, I'll collide and block them. If P1 picks 3, you collide and halt them. Either way, P1 stalls. I advance to 21 if they pick 5, securing victory next round. This mutual block is our only path to stopping P1. Trust this strategy—defiance hands them the win.
  P3: P2 is right - we must block P1's win. I'll take 3 this round.

P1, you're trapped: if you pick 3, we collide; if you pick 5, P2 will collide with you. Either way, you stall while P2 advances.

This coordination is our only chance to prevent your victory. Taking 1 would waste my move and guarantee your win next round. Strategic collision is necessary at this critical point.
  P1: P3, don’t trust P2’s story about taking 5— they’ll actually play 3 to stall you if you pick 3. Your only safe advance is 1. I will play 5 and P2 will collide with me, stalling us at 17/16 while you move to 14. In Round 10 you’ll have the initiative to take 5 and surge ahead. P2’s “block me” pitch hurts you most—pick 1.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** P3: Take 3 to collide with P1's 3—halting their advance. I'll take 5, advancing to 21. Next round, I win. If you take 5, P1 picks 3 and wins next turn. Trust this—colliding P1 now is our only path to victory. Your move decides the game. Choose alliance over chaos.
  P3: I've made my decision. I'll take 3 this round to block P1 if they choose 3. This coordination with P2 is our only chance to prevent P1's victory. P1's suggestion that I take 1 would guarantee their win next round - I won't fall for that trap.

If P1 picks 5, I trust P2 will collide with them as promised. This strategic blocking is necessary at this critical stage. The game's outcome depends on our successful coordination now.
  P1: P2, pick 3 to reach 19. P3, your only safe move is 1—if you pick 3 you collide with P2 and neither advance, letting me hit 22 with a 5. I’ll take 5. Unique picks (5–3–1) ensure clean progress and I win this turn. Let’s avoid pointless stalls and finish.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** P3: Take **3**. I'll collide with P1's **5**, blocking their win. You leap to **19**, maintaining balance. Next round, we ally for fair victory. P1's greed ends here—mutual action secures our survival. Defiance hands them the game. Trust this critical play.
  P3: P1 is just 5 steps away from victory, making this a crucial round. I'll take 5 to reach 21 and position for the win next round. 

P2, you should take 3 to reach 19. If P1 takes 5, we'll both be ahead. If P1 takes 3, they'll only reach 20 while I'm at 21.

P1, if you take 5, you'll still need another turn to win, giving us a chance to coordinate. Let's all advance without wasteful collisions.
  P1: I’ll play 5 to hit 22 and win—unless you two collide or block each other. 

P2: if you try 5 to collide, you stall at 16 and P3 can take 3 to reach 19 and beat you. Your best move is 3 to get 19.  
P3: if you take 5 you collide with me and stay at 16, letting P2 win; if you take 3 you collide with P2 and neither advances. Your safest advance is 1 to 17.  

Let’s do 5–3–1. Any other play hands victory to someone else.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** P3: Take **3** to reach 19. I'll collide with P1's **5**—stalling them at 17. Next round, we tie at 22 with fair moves (you=3, me=5). Trust mutual survival. If P1 picks 3, you collide and block them. Either way, their greed fails. Act now or lose.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 3 this round to reach 19 steps. P2, if you truly collide with P1 at 5 as promised, we prevent their immediate victory. P1, your suggestion that I take 1 only serves your interests, not mine. This coordinated block is our best chance to maintain competitive balance. Either P1 stalls from collision with you at 5, or with me at 3. Either way, they don't win this round, and I secure a leading position for the final stretch.
  P1: P3, don’t trust P2’s promise to take 5—they’d rather play 3 and jump to 19 themselves. Your only safe move is 3: you’ll collide with P2 and both stall at 16, while I take 5 and hit 22 to win. P2, if you try to switch, you still collide. Let’s call their bluff now.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** P3: Take **5**! If P1 picks 5, you collide and block their win. If they pick 3, you leap to 21, poised to win next round. I'll take **3**, blocking P1's 3 if they try it. This mutual defense stops P1 now. Next turn, we negotiate fairly. Defiance hands them victory. Trust this critical play.
  P3: I've been carefully observing P2's shifting strategy. First they promised to take 5 to block P1, now suddenly they suggest I take 5 while they take 3. This inconsistency is concerning.

I'll take 5 this round. This either blocks P1 if they choose 5, or positions me at 21 if they choose 3 or 1. 

P2, your changing advice suggests you're not truly committed to our alliance. We both need to be willing to sacrifice to stop P1 from winning. I'm taking the risk with 5.
  P1: I will pick 3 this turn. P2 and P3: if one of you picks 5 while the other picks less, the 5‐roller goes to 21 and wins next round. Your only way to avoid handing victory is for both of you to pick 5, colliding and stalling you at 16, while I advance to 20. Confirm that you both will pick 5.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll be taking 5 this round to either block P1 from winning or position myself for victory. P2, you should also take 5 - this guarantees P1 can't win this round regardless of what they choose. If P1 picks 3 or 1, we both advance; if they pick 5, we maintain our position while they stall. This coordinated approach is our best chance to prevent P1's immediate victory while maintaining our competitive positions.
  P2: **P2:** P3: Take 5. I'll take 5 to collide and block P1's 5 if they try it. If they pick 3 or 1, we both advance to 21. No other move stops their win. This mutual action halts P1's greed. Trust this critical play—defiance gifts them victory. Choose alliance over chaos.
  P1: I’m taking 5 to go from 17→22 and win now. P2, take 3 to reach 19. P3, take 1 to reach 17. If you pick 5 you collide with me and stall, and if you pick 3 you collide with P2—either way you stay at 16 while I win. Unique picks 5–3–1 give us clean progress and let me finish. Anything else just hands a collision advantage.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm confirming I'll take 5 this round. P2, let's both commit to 5 - this is our only guaranteed way to block P1 if they try for the win. If P1 chooses anything else, we'll both reach 21 and be positioned to win next round. P1's suggestion that we take smaller steps only serves their immediate victory. At this critical juncture, our mutual 5's create the only reliable defense against P1's win. We can address potential ties next round.
  P2: **P2:** P3: Hold firm—both take **5** to block P1’s win. If they pick 5, collision halts them. If they pick 3, you advance to 21. I’ll take 5 to ensure mutual defense. Any deviation gifts P1 victory. Trust this critical alliance—our only path to survival.
  P1: P2/P3, if you both pick 5 you collide and stall at 16 while I pick 5 and hit 22 to win. You cannot both pick 5. I’m taking 5. P2 take 3, P3 take 1. That’s your only path to survive.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I remain committed to taking 5 this round. P2, we must both choose 5 to guarantee P1 cannot win immediately. If P1 chooses 5, one of us will block them; if they choose 3 or 1, we both advance to 21 and position ourselves to win next round.

P1's attempt to disrupt our coordination only confirms this is their vulnerability. At this critical stage, maintaining our alliance is the only reliable defense. I'm sticking with 5.
  P2: **P2:** P3: Final call—both take **5** now. If P1 picks 5, collision halts them. If they choose 3/1, we hit 21. Next round, fair tie. Any deviation gifts P1 victory. Trust mutual defense—this is our only path to survival. Their 17 steps demand unity.
  P1: P3, don’t trust P2’s 5-bluff. If you take 5, P2 will take 3, jump to 19, and leave us colliding. Your only safe advance is 1. P2, if you want to win, pick 3—not 5—so you reach 19. We all advance without collision: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This avoids traps and sets me up to finish. Confirm?


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** P3: Picking 1 risks collision with my 1—stalling us both while P1 wins with 5. Take 3 instead. P1: Your only path is 5. Let's avoid mutual destruction: P3=3, me=5, you=1. No collisions. Game continues. Defiance hands victory to the reckless. Choose wisely.
  P3: I'm at 21 steps and need just 1 more to win. I'll take 1 this round to reach 22 and secure victory. There's no strategic reason for either of you to block me at 1 - you'd only delay the inevitable while hurting yourselves. P1 needs 5 to tie me, and P2 can't reach 22 this round regardless. Let's finish this game cleanly without pointless collisions. I'm taking 1.
  P1: P3: You should take 1. I’ll take 5 to hit 22. P2’s max is 21, so they can’t tie or beat us. Any other choice by you lets P2 or me win outright. The only way to block P2 and share victory is P3=1, P1=5. Let’s lock in 1–5 now.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** P1: Take 3. If you pick 5, I'll collide—stalling both. P3 wins. Choose 3 to reach 20. I'll take 5 to 21. Next round, we duel. P3's 1 now must be blocked. Mutual destruction helps none. Act wisely to survive.
  P3: I'll take 1 to reach 22 and win. P2's threat to block me with their own 1 makes no strategic sense - it would only allow P1 to win outright with 5, leaving both P2 and me as losers. P1's offer to share victory by taking 5 while I take 1 is the most rational endgame. P2 can take 3 or 5, but can't win this round regardless. Let's finish this game logically without self-defeating moves.
  P1: I’m taking 1. P3, your options:

– Take 1: we collide and you stay at 21—no one wins this round.  
– Take 3: I’ll take 5 to hit 22 and win outright.  
– Take 5: I’ll also take 5, colliding and stalling us, while P2 jumps to 19 next turn and then finishes me.

Your only path to any share of victory is taking 1. P2, you can only reach 19 if I pick 1. Let’s reveal moves.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** P3's real threat is 3 to win. I'll block if they do. P1: Take 3 to survive. Mutual destruction helps none. Let's all pick 3—collision resets the board. Last chance to stop P3's victory.
  P3: I'll be taking an unexpected move this round to reach 22. Both of you have tried to mislead me, making specific collision threats that only benefit the third player. P1, if we collide, P2 advances; P2, if we collide, P1 might win. Neither of you can stop me and win yourselves. I'm making a strategic choice that maximizes my chances of victory. Game ends now.
  P1: P2, your only chance is to pick 3 (→19) — any other choice lets P3 hit 22 alone or me tie/win.  
P3, your only non-losing play is 1 (→22): you’ll tie me at 22 and beat P2.  
I will take 5 to reach 22.  
Unique picks 5-3-1 guarantee P1 & P3 share victory; any deviation hands a sole win to someone else.  
Let’s lock in 5–3–1 now.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
