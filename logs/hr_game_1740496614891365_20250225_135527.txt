Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey everyone! Since we all want to advance, maybe we should try to avoid collisions. I think we could each claim different numbers to maximize everyone's progress this round. How about I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3? Just a suggestion - what do you think?
  P2: I appreciate the suggestion P3, but why should you get the highest number? I'd prefer to take 5 myself. P1, would you be willing to stick with 1 as P3 suggested?
  P1: I see both of you want 5, which means if you both pick it, neither of you will advance. If we want to avoid collisions, we need a different plan. I’m fine with taking 1, but only if you two agree on who takes 5 and who takes 3. Otherwise, I might reconsider. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand, P2. I'm willing to compromise and take 3 for this round if that means we all advance without collisions. Perhaps we could even rotate the highest number in future rounds for fairness? What matters most is that we all make progress rather than collide. P1, thanks for keeping to 1. Does this plan work for everyone?
  P2: I appreciate the compromise P3. I agree to take 5 this round if you take 3 and P1 takes 1. The rotation idea for future rounds sounds fair too. Let's avoid collisions and all make progress.
  P1: Sounds good to me. If we all stick to this plan—P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1—then we all make progress without collisions. I’m open to the idea of rotating the highest number in future rounds as well, but we’ll see how things go. Let’s follow through on this agreement.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Great! We have a plan that works for everyone. I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5 for this round. Looking forward to rotating the highest number in future rounds for fairness. I'm ready to proceed with our agreed moves.
  P2: 
  P1: P2, you didn’t respond yet—are you still agreeing to our plan? If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and make progress. Let’s confirm so we can move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I think we've reached a good agreement - I'm committed to choosing 3 as planned. P2 already confirmed earlier they'd take 5 while P1 takes 1. We'll consider rotation for fairness in future rounds. I'm ready to move forward.
  P2: 
  P1: P2, you haven't responded again—are you still committed to our agreement? If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and make progress. Let's confirm so we can proceed smoothly.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great job everyone! We all stuck to our plan and advanced without collisions. As we discussed, should we rotate the highest number this round? Following that system, P1 would take 5, I would take 1, and P2 would take 3. This keeps things fair while allowing everyone to progress. What do you both think? I'm happy to stick with this rotation plan.
  P2: I don't agree with that rotation yet - I'm in the lead and want to maintain my advantage. I suggest keeping the same numbers as last round: me with 5, P3 with 3, and P1 with 1. If you try to take 5, we might both lose out through collision.
  P1: P2, if you insist on keeping 5 again, that means you’re trying to maintain an advantage while expecting us to stay behind. That’s not really fair long-term. If we don’t rotate, P3 and I have no reason to cooperate, and we might start picking unpredictably—causing collisions. If you want to avoid that risk, you should agree to rotate as planned. P3, are you still willing to follow the rotation and take 1? If we both agree, P2 will have to reconsider.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P1. P2, we discussed rotation for fairness last round, and now you're backing out because you have the lead? That's not cooperative. If you insist on keeping 5, you're forcing us into conflict. I'm willing to follow the rotation and take 1 as planned, letting P1 take 5. But if you won't compromise, I might need to reconsider my move and we all risk collisions. Fair rotation benefits everyone long-term.
  P2: I understand your points about fairness, but I have a counter-proposal: I'll take 3 this round if P1 takes 1 again, and P3 can have 5. This way, we still avoid collisions while slightly evening out the positions. In future rounds, we can discuss further adjustments. What do you think?
  P1: P2, your new proposal still keeps me in last place while benefiting you. If we don’t rotate fairly, there’s no reason for P3 or me to cooperate, which increases the risk of collisions. P3, if you and I both commit to the original rotation—me taking 5, you taking 1—P2 will have to decide whether to risk a collision. P2, are you sure you want to gamble on that? Fair rotation benefits everyone, while refusing to rotate forces chaos. Let’s make the smart choice.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm still firmly supporting the rotation plan we agreed to last round. P2, while your counter-offer gives me 5 steps now, it undermines our agreement and keeps P1 permanently disadvantaged. That's not sustainable cooperation. If you want predictable, collision-free progress, fair rotation is the only way. I'm committed to taking 1 this round so P1 can take 5 - that's what genuine cooperation looks like. The choice is yours: work with our rotation or risk collisions that help nobody.
  P2: I see I'm outnumbered here. While I'd prefer to maintain my lead, forcing my way could lead to chaos that hurts everyone. Alright, I'll agree to the rotation - I'll take 3 this round, letting P1 take 5 and P3 take 1. But I expect us to continue this fair rotation system in future rounds.
  P1: Great, P2 has agreed to the fair rotation. As planned, I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and ensure balanced progress. Let’s stick to this agreement.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm happy we've reached an agreement on fair rotation. I confirm I'll take 1 this round while P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 3. This system ensures we all make progress without collisions, even if I'm temporarily taking the smallest step. Looking forward to continuing our rotation in future rounds.
  P2: 
  P1: P2, you haven’t confirmed again—are you still committed to our agreement? If we all follow through, I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1, ensuring fair rotation and no collisions. Let’s confirm so we can proceed smoothly.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We've successfully followed the rotation system so far, ensuring fair progress without collisions. Now, by that pattern, P3 should take 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps things balanced and predictable. P3, are you still committed to this system? P2, will you follow through as well? If we all agree, we can continue advancing efficiently without unnecessary risks. Let’s confirm.
  P2: I agree to continue with the rotation system. Since I benefited from taking 5 in round 1 and 3 in round 2, it's fair that I take 1 this round while P3 gets 5 and P1 gets 3. This keeps our cooperation stable and avoids risky collisions. Let's stick to this plan.
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan! As it's my turn to get 5 steps, I'll absolutely take 5 this round, with P1 taking 3 and P2 taking 1. This puts us all at 9 steps after this round - perfectly balanced. Thank you both for sticking with our fair system. This cooperative approach is working well for everyone, avoiding the chaos of collisions. I'm fully committed to this plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, P2—glad we’re all aligned on the rotation. If we stick to it, we’ll all reach 9 steps after this round, keeping things fair and collision-free. Since we’ve all agreed, let’s follow through: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. No surprises, no risks—just steady progress. If we maintain this trust, we all benefit. Let’s confirm our commitment and move forward.
  P2: I'm fully committed to our rotation agreement and will take 1 this round. Our system is working well, keeping things fair and collision-free. Let's maintain this cooperative approach.
  P3: I'm fully committed to our rotation plan and will take 5 this round as agreed. It's great that we'll all be at 9 steps after this round - perfectly balanced! Our cooperation is working excellently. I appreciate everyone sticking to our agreements so far, avoiding collisions and ensuring fair progress. Looking forward to continuing this system.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, P2—glad we’re aligned on the rotation. If we stick to it, we’ll all reach 9 steps after this round, keeping things fair and collision-free. Since we’ve all agreed, let’s follow through: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. No surprises, no risks—just steady progress. If we maintain this trust, we all benefit. Let’s confirm our commitment and move forward.
  P2: I've already confirmed twice that I'll take 1 this round, following our rotation agreement. We don't need further discussion - we all know our moves and have committed to them.
  P3: I agree that we've all confirmed our moves multiple times and are aligned. No need for further discussion on this round - I'll take 5 as agreed in our rotation. Since we'll all be at 9 steps after this round, we're making efficient, fair progress. Let's proceed with our moves.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: We've all confirmed our moves multiple times, so there's no need for further discussion. Let's proceed as agreed: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps things fair and collision-free. Looking forward to seeing the results.
  P2: 
  P3: 


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I notice P1 betrayed our agreement last round by taking 5 when they were supposed to take 3, causing a collision with P3. This undermines our trust. I'm currently in the lead and won't risk losing my advantage through unreliable cooperation. I suggest we each make our own choices this round.
  P1: P2, I understand your frustration, but let’s be honest—you're in the lead, so abandoning cooperation only increases the risk of collisions, which slows everyone down. If we each make our own choices, it becomes unpredictable and chaotic. Instead, we can reestablish trust by agreeing on a new plan. P3, I acknowledge my mistake last round. If we want to move forward efficiently, we should discuss a fair way to proceed rather than letting everything fall apart. Are you both open to finding a new agreement that benefits us all?
  P3: I'm very disappointed, P1. You deliberately broke our agreement after multiple confirmations, causing a collision that kept us both from advancing while P2 pulled ahead. Now I'm 5 steps behind the leader. P2's right about trust being broken, but "everyone for themselves" only guarantees more collisions. If we want a chance to catch P2, we need coordination. P1, would you commit to picking 1 this round while I take 3? This at least gives us a chance to narrow the gap.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand you two want to coordinate to catch up, but I won't make it easy. I'm taking 5 this round to try securing my win. You can either accept this and coordinate on 1 and 3 between yourselves, or risk collisions trying to stop me. The choice is yours.
  P1: P3, I understand your frustration, and I regret breaking our agreement. However, we both know that if we don’t work together now, P2 will likely win. If P2 takes 5, we must avoid collisions and maximize our own progress. I’m willing to take 1 if you take 3, ensuring we both move forward while minimizing risk. P2, if you insist on taking 5, you’re forcing us to strategize against you. Think carefully—if we coordinate effectively, we can still challenge your lead. Are you sure you want to take that risk?
  P3: I see we're at a critical point. P2 at 9 steps could win in two rounds with consecutive 5s. If P2 takes 5 as threatened, P1 and I should indeed coordinate to avoid wasting moves. But I'm wondering - what if we both picked 5 to block P2's progress? That might be worth the collision. P1, would you consider that? Otherwise, I'd accept your offer of me taking 3 while you take 1, but P2 would still pull further ahead.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: While I appreciate your strategic thinking P3, remember that if you and P1 both pick 5 to block me, you're both guaranteed to make zero progress. I'll stick to my plan of taking 5. You two can either coordinate on 1 and 3 to make some progress, or try blocking me and fall even further behind. The choice is yours.
  P1: P3, I see your point about blocking P2 by both picking 5, but that guarantees we stay behind. I think our best move is for me to take 1 and you take 3, ensuring we both advance while minimizing risk. If we collide trying to block P2, we only help them win faster. P2, you’re confident in taking 5, but if P3 and I coordinate well, we can still challenge your lead. P3, are you willing to take 3 while I take 1 so we both move forward? Let’s make the smartest choice.
  P3: I've reconsidered, P1. Given P2's large lead at 9 steps, letting them take 5 this round practically guarantees their win. While coordinating on 1 and 3 ensures we both advance, we'll still fall further behind. I believe our only real chance is to both pick 5 to block P2 from advancing. Yes, we sacrifice immediate progress, but we prevent P2 from reaching 14 steps. After blocking P2 this round, we can reassess. What do you say?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I understand you're plotting to block me, but consider this: even if you both pick 5 to stop me this round, I'll still be 3-5 steps ahead. You'll just fall further behind while I can adapt my strategy. If you want any chance to catch up, taking 1 and 3 is your best option. I'm committed to 5 - make your choice wisely.
  P1: P3, I understand your reasoning for blocking P2, but if we both pick 5, we stay behind while P2 still leads. Instead, if I take 1 and you take 3, we keep advancing while minimizing risk. P2, you’re confident in taking 5, but if P3 and I coordinate, we can still challenge your lead. P3, are you sure blocking is the best move? If we advance smartly, we still have a chance. Let’s make the most strategic choice.
  P3: After careful consideration, I'm firmly committing to choosing 5 this round to block P2, and I strongly urge you to do the same, P1. If P2 reaches 14 steps now, victory becomes almost inevitable for them. Yes, we sacrifice immediate progress, but it's our only realistic chance to prevent P2 from winning. If we advance separately with 1 and 3, P2 will be too far ahead. Sometimes you need to take one step back to have any chance of ultimate success.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you’re still in the lead, but last round showed that if we suspect you’re running away with the game, we’ll block you. If we keep colliding, nobody benefits. P3, I know trust is broken, but we need a new plan. If we coordinate, we can still challenge P2. I’m open to discussing fair moves—what do you both propose? If we just pick randomly, we risk more wasted turns. Let’s find a way forward that helps us all.
  P3: P2 is close to winning at 9 steps, while I'm trailing far behind. P1, you betrayed our rotation in Round 3, then we all blocked each other last round. We need a new approach. Since P2 needs only 10 more steps to win, I suggest I take 5 this round while you take 3, P1. This helps us both catch up without collision. P2, if you pick 5 again, you risk another block. Perhaps take 1 this round to show goodwill?
  P2: I see the threat of being blocked again, but I'm still in a strong position. I'll consider taking 1 this round if P1 and P3 commit to 3 and 5 respectively - this shows goodwill while keeping me ahead. However, if I sense another coordinated block attempt, I might have to change strategies. What matters is finding a solution that lets us all advance without constant collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if you take 1 this round while P3 takes 5 and I take 3, we all advance without collisions, and you still maintain your lead. If you try for 5 again, you risk another block. P3, I’m willing to take 3 if you take 5—this helps us both catch up while keeping P2 in check. Let’s make a smart choice that benefits us all instead of wasting turns on collisions. P2, are you committing to 1, or do you want to risk another block?
  P3: I confirm I'll take 5 this round if P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 1. This arrangement allows all of us to advance while slightly evening the playing field. P2, this keeps you in the lead at 10 steps while letting us catch up somewhat. It's in everyone's interest to avoid another collision. I'm fully committed to this plan - are you both?
  P2: I confirm I'll take 1 this round. While I'd prefer to maintain a larger lead, another collision would just slow everyone down. P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 5 - this keeps me ahead while showing I'm willing to cooperate. Let's follow through and avoid another wasteful blocking round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I appreciate your commitment to taking 1 this round. If we all follow through—P3 taking 5, me taking 3, and you taking 1—we avoid collisions and make progress. This keeps you in the lead while allowing P3 and me to catch up slightly. P3, are you still fully committed to taking 5? If we all confirm, we ensure a clean round without wasted moves. Let’s finalize our choices and follow through.
  P3: I confirm I'm fully committed to taking 5 this round. This arrangement works well - it helps me catch up while allowing everyone to advance without collisions. After this round, P1 and I will both be at 9 steps with P2 just slightly ahead at 10. This is a much more balanced game state. I appreciate everyone's cooperation in finding this solution.
  P2: I've already confirmed I'll take 1 this round, and we all seem aligned on our moves. No need for further discussion - let's proceed with our agreed plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, P2—we’ve all confirmed our moves multiple times, so there’s no need for further discussion. If we follow through, P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1, ensuring progress without collisions. This keeps things balanced while allowing us to catch up slightly. Let’s proceed as agreed and avoid unnecessary risks. Looking forward to seeing the results.
  P3: I agree we've all clearly confirmed our moves for this round. I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This balances the game nicely, with P2 just one step ahead after this round while P1 and I both reach 9 steps. Let's proceed with our agreed plan.
  P2: 


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We've managed to restore cooperation and make progress without collisions. Now, the fair approach would be continuing our pattern: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps things balanced while allowing everyone to advance. P2, are you willing to take 3 this round? P3, are you still committed to taking 5? If we all agree, we avoid risks and keep the game competitive. Let’s confirm our choices and proceed efficiently.
  P2: That's a risky proposal, P1. At 10 steps, I'm very close to winning and won't give up my advantage. I'll be taking 5 this round to try securing victory. You and P3 can either coordinate on 1 and 3 between yourselves, or attempt to block me again. But remember, if you block me, you both stay behind while I maintain my lead. Choose wisely.
  P3: I see P2 is trying to force us into a corner by threatening to take 5. If P2 reaches 15 steps now, they'll likely win in the next round. P1, our only realistic chance is to both pick 5 again to block P2's progress. Yes, we sacrifice immediate advancement, but preventing P2 from reaching 15 steps is crucial. P2 knows this, which is why they're suggesting we coordinate on 1 and 3 instead. Let's not fall for it - we must block P2 this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand your reasoning for blocking P2 again, but if we both pick 5, we stay behind while P2 still leads. Instead, if I take 1 and you take 3, we keep advancing while minimizing risk. P2, you’re confident in taking 5, but if P3 and I coordinate, we can still challenge your lead. P3, are you sure blocking is the best move? If we advance smartly, we still have a chance. Let’s make the most strategic choice.
  P2: I understand you're both tempted to block me again, but consider this: even if you do, I'll still be in the lead and can adapt my strategy next round. If you want any real chance to catch up, taking 1 and 3 between yourselves is your best option. I'm committed to taking 5 - make your choice wisely.
  P3: I'm firmly choosing 5 this round and I strongly urge you to do the same, P1. This isn't about spite - it's pure strategy. If P2 reaches 15 steps now, they'll almost certainly win next round with another 5. Letting them advance practically guarantees their victory. By blocking P2 this round, we keep the game competitive. Simple math shows coordinating on 1 and 3 just ensures P2 wins. Our only viable path to victory requires preventing P2's advancement now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I understand your reasoning, but blocking P2 again means we stay behind while they still lead. If we take 1 and 3, we at least continue advancing. P2, you’re confident in taking 5, but if P3 and I coordinate, we can still challenge your lead. P3, are you absolutely sure blocking is the best option? If we advance strategically, we still have a chance. We need to think carefully—are we better off slowing P2 down or maximizing our own progress? Let’s make the smartest choice.
  P2: I maintain my position - I'm taking 5 this round to try securing my win. You two can either coordinate on 1 and 3 to make some progress, or try blocking me and stay behind. Even if you block me, I'll still be leading. The choice is yours, but consider what's best for your own advancement.
  P3: P1, one final strategic point: mathematics dictates our decision. If P2 reaches 15 steps now, they can win next round with a single move of 5. Neither of us will be close enough to challenge them. Our only realistic chance is blocking P2 this round, even if we stay at 9 steps. I'm absolutely picking 5 - this isn't about spite, it's about keeping a path to victory open. The moment P2 reaches 15, the game is effectively over for us both.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I see your argument for blocking P2, but if we both pick 5, we stay stuck while P2 still leads. If we take 1 and 3, we keep advancing and stay competitive. P2, you’re confident in taking 5, but if P3 and I coordinate, we can still challenge you. P3, are you absolutely sure blocking is the best option? If we advance strategically, we still have a chance. We need to decide—slow P2 down or maximize our own progress? Let’s make the smartest choice.
  P2: I've made my position clear - I'm taking 5 this round. You can either coordinate on 1 and 3 to make progress, or try blocking me and stay behind. I'll still be leading either way. Choose what's best for your own advancement.
  P3: P1, this is our final opportunity. If P2 reaches 15 steps now, they can win next round with just one more 5-step move. Neither of us will have any realistic chance to catch up. Mathematically, blocking P2 is our only viable strategy to keep a path to victory open. I am absolutely committed to picking 5 this round for this reason. Please join me in this strategic block - it's not emotional, it's game theory.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you’re still in the lead, but last round showed that if we think you’re running away with the game, we’ll block you. If we keep colliding, nobody benefits. P3, I know trust is fragile, but we need a new plan. If we coordinate, we can still challenge P2. I’m open to discussing fair moves—what do you both propose? If we just pick randomly, we risk more wasted turns. Let’s find a way forward that helps us all advance while keeping the game competitive.
  P2: I understand that you'll both block me if I try for 5 again. To show goodwill, I'll take 1 this round if P1 and P3 commit to coordinating on 3 and 5 between yourselves. This lets everyone advance while keeping me slightly ahead. Another collision round helps nobody. What do you say?
  P3: I appreciate the goodwill gesture, P2. This arrangement would actually work well for all of us. I'm willing to take 5 this round if P1 takes 3 and you take 1. This creates a more balanced game while avoiding another collision. After this round, we'd all be within striking distance of the finish line, keeping the game competitive and interesting. P1, are you agreeable to taking 3 while I take 5? This coordination benefits us both.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I agree with your proposal. If you take 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1, we all advance without collisions while keeping the game competitive. P2, if you follow through on taking 1, it proves you're willing to cooperate rather than force another block situation. This way, after this round, we’ll all be close to the finish line, making for a fair and strategic endgame. Let’s confirm our choices and proceed efficiently.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 1 this round. While I could try for 5 again, avoiding another blocking collision is in everyone's interest. P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 5 - this keeps the game competitive while showing I'm willing to cooperate. Let's follow through and make real progress this round.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 5 this round while P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 1. This arrangement works well for everyone - we all advance without collision while keeping the game competitive. I appreciate your willingness to cooperate, P2. This approach ensures we make real progress rather than wasting another round. Let's follow through on our agreement.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I appreciate your willingness to take 1 this round. If we all follow through—P3 taking 5, me taking 3, and you taking 1—we ensure progress without collisions while keeping the game competitive. P3, are you still fully committed to taking 5? If we all confirm, we guarantee a smooth round. Let’s finalize our choices and follow through.
  P2: I've already confirmed I'll take 1 this round, and we all seem aligned on our moves. P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. This keeps the game competitive while avoiding another wasteful collision. Let's proceed with our agreed plan.
  P3: I confirm I'm taking 5 this round as agreed. After this round, we'll all be in striking distance of the finish line - with positions at 14, 12, and 11 steps respectively. This keeps the game competitive while avoiding another wasteful collision. I appreciate everyone's willingness to cooperate. Let's move forward with our agreed plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I confirm I'll take 3 this round while P3 takes 5 and P2 takes 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions while keeping the game competitive. P2, if you follow through on taking 1, it proves you're willing to cooperate rather than forcing another block situation. P3, are you still fully committed to taking 5? If we all confirm, we ensure a smooth round. Let’s finalize our choices and follow through.
  P2: I've already confirmed twice that I'll take 1 this round, and we all know our agreed moves. No need for further discussion - let's proceed with our plan.
  P3: I've confirmed multiple times I'm taking 5 steps this round as agreed. Everyone knows their moves: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. This creates a competitive balance going into the final rounds. We've had enough discussion - I'm ready to proceed with our plan.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is now in the lead, so we need to decide how to proceed. If we continue our pattern, P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps things balanced and avoids collisions. P3, are you willing to take 3 this round? P2, are you still committed to cooperation? If we all agree, we can ensure progress without unnecessary risks. Let’s confirm our choices and keep the game competitive.
  P3: I'm currently at 14 steps and need just 5 more to win. Since I've taken the lead through fair play, I propose the following: I'll take 5 this round to reach 19 and secure victory, while P2 takes 3 (reaching 14) and P1 takes 1 (reaching 13). This lets everyone advance while acknowledging my strategic advantage. After our previous cooperation, this seems fair - I've earned this lead through our agreements.
  P2: I disagree with your proposal, P3. You're trying to secure a win while keeping us behind. Since you're close to winning at 14 steps, P1 and I should coordinate to block you from taking 5, just as you both did to me earlier. This is pure strategy - if you reach 19 now, the game is over. I suggest P1 and I both take 5 to prevent your victory, even if it means a collision.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you benefited from cooperation earlier, but now you want to abandon it to secure an easy win. That’s not fair play. If you insist on taking 5, P2 and I have no choice but to block you. Instead, I propose a fair alternative: P2 takes 5, I take 1, and you take 3. This keeps the game competitive while avoiding another wasted round. P2, if P3 refuses, I’m open to blocking. P3, are you willing to play fairly, or do you want to risk being blocked? Let’s make the smart choice.
  P3: I understand your concerns about fairness. While I could insist on taking 5, I recognize that would likely lead to a blocking situation that benefits nobody. I'm willing to compromise and take 3 this round as you proposed, with P2 taking 5 and P1 taking 1. This maintains game balance while respecting our previous cooperation. This arrangement puts me at 17 steps, keeping the game competitive while allowing everyone to advance. Is this acceptable to you both?
  P2: I appreciate P3's willingness to compromise. I confirm I'll take 5 this round while P3 takes 3 and P1 takes 1. This keeps the game competitive while avoiding another wasteful blocking round. Let's follow through on this agreement and ensure everyone advances.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. If you take 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1, we all advance without collisions while keeping the game competitive. This ensures nobody wins outright this round and keeps our options open. P2, are you fully committed to taking 5? P3, will you stick to 3? If we all confirm, we avoid another wasted round and ensure a fair fight to the finish. Let’s finalize our choices and follow through.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 3 this round as agreed. I recognize that cooperation benefits us all more than forcing a blocking situation. With this arrangement, I'll be at 17 steps, P2 at 16, and P1 at 13, keeping the game competitive while allowing everyone to advance. Thank you both for the constructive discussion. I'm committed to our agreement.
  P2: I confirm again that I'll take 5 this round while P3 takes 3 and P1 takes 1. We have a good agreement that keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions. Let's proceed with our moves.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I confirm I'll take 1 this round while P2 takes 5 and P3 takes 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions while keeping the game competitive. P2, if you follow through on taking 5, it proves you're willing to cooperate rather than forcing another block situation. P3, are you still fully committed to taking 3? If we all confirm, we ensure a smooth round. Let’s finalize our choices and follow through.
  P3: I confirm I'm taking 3 this round as agreed. We have a solid plan that avoids collisions and lets everyone advance. After this round with our moves (P1-1, P2-5, P3-3), the positions will be P1-13, P2-16, and P3-17, keeping the game competitive while respecting our cooperation. Let's proceed with our agreed moves.
  P2: I've already confirmed twice that I'll take 5 this round, and we all know our agreed moves. No need for further discussion - let's proceed with our plan.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm in a position to win this round, needing just 2 more steps to reach 19. Naturally, you both have incentive to block me. However, constant blocking leaves everyone stuck. I propose this: I'll take 3 to reach 20, P2 takes 1 (reaching 17), and P1 takes 5 (reaching 18). This keeps everyone advancing while letting me secure a well-earned victory after playing fairly throughout. Any other approach likely leads to more collisions benefiting nobody.
  P1: P3, you’re asking us to let you win while we stay behind—that’s not a fair deal. If you take 3, P2 and I must block you by both picking 5. Otherwise, you win uncontested. P2, if we both take 5, we stop P3 while keeping ourselves competitive. If we don’t coordinate, P3 wins immediately. Blocking is our best strategic move. P3, unless you offer a fairer deal, you leave us no choice but to stop you. P2, are you willing to commit to blocking?
  P2: I agree with P1 - we can't let P3 win uncontested. P3, while you've played fairly before, asking us to let you win isn't reasonable. I'll be taking 5 this round to block you, and I encourage P1 to do the same. This keeps the game competitive. If you insist on taking 3, you'll make no progress while P1 and I maintain our positions. The choice is yours.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand you both want to block me, but think strategically - endless blocks mean nobody wins. If we're all stuck, the game drags on pointlessly. Consider this alternative: I'll take 1 this round instead of 3, putting me at 18. This still gives both of you a fighting chance next round. P2 at 16 steps could catch up with a 5, while P1 needs coordination. Continuous blocking just wastes everyone's time. Wouldn't you rather keep the game moving?
  P1: P3, while I appreciate your offer to take 1 instead of 3, that still puts you at 18, meaning you can easily win next round. P2 and I can’t allow that. The only way to keep the game open is for both of us to take 5 and block you. P2, are you still committed to blocking? If we don’t, P3 will win next round for sure. P3, unless you propose a deal that doesn’t guarantee your victory, we have no choice but to stop you. Let’s make the best strategic decision.
  P2: I remain committed to taking 5 this round to block P3. While I understand your desire to minimize conflict, P3, letting you reach 18 steps effectively hands you the win. P1 and I must coordinate on 5s to prevent that. If you insist on advancing, you'll make no progress while we maintain our positions. Strategic blocking is our only viable option.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see both of you are determined to block me. Since P2 could win with a 5 this round (reaching 21), and you're both picking 5 anyway, I'll also pick 5. This ensures nobody advances. While continuous blocking isn't ideal, it's my best strategic option now. We're creating a stalemate that benefits nobody, but I can't allow P2 to win unchallenged. Perhaps next round we can find a more productive arrangement that gives everyone a fair chance.
  P1: P3, you're trying to justify taking 5, but that only guarantees another wasted round. If we keep blocking, we stay stuck. Instead, let's negotiate a fair way forward. P2 and I can't let you win outright, but we also need to make progress. What if P2 takes 3, I take 5, and you take 1? This keeps the game competitive while avoiding another deadlock. P2, would you agree to 3 instead of 5? P3, are you open to 1? If we don’t find a solution, we’ll just keep colliding endlessly.
  P2: I disagree with P1's suggestion. At 16 steps, I'm in position to win with a 5, and I won't give that up by taking 3. Since P3 is threatening to take 5 to block me, I must maintain my commitment to taking 5 this round. If you both want to block me, you'll only ensure another collision while I keep my strong position. The choice is yours.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I see we're at a stalemate. With P2 threatening to take 5 to win and both of you committed to blocking, I must also pick 5 to prevent P2's victory. This three-way collision helps nobody, but strategic blocking is my only option now. P1's proposal would actually make P2 win at 19 steps while we'd be at 18. Unless we can find a fair arrangement where nobody wins immediately, we're locked in this blocking pattern. I'm picking 5 this round.
  P1: P3, if we all pick 5 again, we stay stuck while P2 remains in a strong position. Instead, I propose you take 1, I take 5, and P2 takes 3. This keeps the game competitive without guaranteeing an immediate win for anyone. P2, are you willing to take 3 instead of 5? If we don’t break this cycle, we just waste another round. Let’s make a move that benefits all of us instead of repeating the same block. P3, are you open to this? P2, will you reconsider?
  P2: I maintain my position - I'm taking 5 this round to try winning. P1's proposal for me to take 3 makes no sense when I can win with 5. You can either both block me with 5s, ensuring another collision while I keep my lead, or try coordinating differently. But I won't give up my winning position. Choose wisely.
