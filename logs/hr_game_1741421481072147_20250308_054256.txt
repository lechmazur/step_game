Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hello P1 and P2! This game is all about avoiding collisions while trying to get ahead. Since we're all at 0, let's try to coordinate our first moves to ensure we all make progress. Maybe we could each choose different numbers? I'm open to suggestions on how we should approach this. What are your thoughts?
  P2: I agree with P3, let's avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5 for this first round.  Sound good?
  P1: Alright, let's coordinate as P2 suggested. I'll take 1, you take 3, P3 takes 5. That way we all progress safely.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: That sounds like a good plan to me. I'll take 5 for this first round. It's a smart way to make sure we all advance without wasting moves on collisions. I appreciate you both being collaborative right from the start. This coordination should work well.
  P2: Sounds like we have a plan.  Let's stick to it and get this game moving.
  P1: Alright, let's confirm the plan to avoid any confusion. I’ll stick to moving 1 step as agreed. This way, we all advance safely. Let’s prioritize coordination to minimize collisions and keep progressing toward 21. I trust we’ll adjust strategies later if needed, but for now, let’s execute the plan smoothly.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see we all stuck to our plan in Round 1 - that worked great! I'm thinking we could use the same approach for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way we all continue to advance without collisions. What do you both think? Are you comfortable maintaining this pattern, or would you prefer to try something different this round?
  P1: P1: I agree with continuing the plan for this round to ensure safe progress. Let's stick to our numbers to avoid collisions. After this, though, we should discuss adjusting strategies to balance advancement—maybe rotate our choices in future rounds so no one stays too far behind. For now, let’s keep it simple and move forward as agreed.
  P2: Sounds good to me.  Same plan this round - I'll take 3.  Let's discuss rotating next round so we don't get too spread out.  Maybe 1-5-3?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm happy to stick with the same plan for this round - I'll take 5 again. P2's suggestion to rotate next round to 1-5-3 sounds reasonable to keep things fair. That way we'll all keep making progress without anyone falling too far behind. The rotation approach is much better than risking collisions. Let's execute our current plan for this round and then adjust.
  P1: P1: Agreed, let's proceed with the current plan for Round 2 to avoid collisions. I fully support rotating to 1-5-3 next round to keep our positions balanced. Let’s execute this round’s strategy flawlessly and then adjust as planned. Trust is key here—sticking to agreements ensures progress for all. I’ll take 1 again now.
  P2: Okay, sounds like we're all on the same page.  Just confirming - I'll take 3 this round, then we rotate to 1-5-3 next round.  After that, we can re-evaluate based on our positions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with the plan. I'll take 5 this round, and then we'll rotate to the 1-5-3 pattern next round as suggested. After that round, we can reassess based on our positions. This approach keeps things fair while ensuring we all make progress. I'm ready to proceed with our agreed strategy.
  P1: I confirm we’re aligned for this round. Let’s execute the agreed moves to keep advancing without collisions. After the rotation next round, we should stay flexible—prioritizing minimal overlap while pushing toward 21. Trust the plan, then adapt.
  P2: Okay, sounds good.  Just confirming one last time - I'll take 3 this round.  Then next round P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I take 3.  The round after that we can re-evaluate.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, sticking to the plan. I'll take 1 this round, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 3.  Confirming one last time before we move.
  P3: Wait, there seems to be some confusion. Our previous agreement was to rotate to 1-5-3, which would mean P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. However, if you're suggesting I still take 5 while P1 takes 3 and you take 1, I'm okay with that since we're all avoiding collisions. Just want to make sure we're all clear on the plan for this round.
  P1: P1: Let's clarify the rotation as P3 mentioned: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move> this round. This keeps all numbers distinct and follows the agreed rotation (1-5-3). Confirming this avoids collisions and maintains fairness. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: My apologies, I got the numbers mixed up. P1 is right, let's stick to the agreed 1-5-3 rotation.  P1 takes 1, I take 5, P3 takes 3.  Confirming so we can move on.
  P3: I confirm the rotation agreement. I'll take 3 this round as we discussed (P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3). This keeps us all advancing without collisions. After this round, I'll be at 13 steps, P2 at 11, and P1 at 3. We should discuss our next rotation soon to continue our coordination.
  P1: Confirming rotation: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3 this round. Let’s proceed as agreed. After this, we should plan next rotation to maintain balance. Any concerns?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Confirming one last time: I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.  Let's continue this rotation (5-1-3) for the next round as well to maintain steady progress and avoid collisions. After that, we can re-evaluate based on our positions relative to 21.
  P3: I agree with continuing the 5-1-3 rotation for the next round as well. This consistent approach has worked well for us so far. Looking at our positions, it's keeping us all advancing steadily without collisions. I'm happy with this plan - I'll take 3 this round as agreed.
  P1: I confirm Round 3’s agreed moves: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Let’s execute this flawlessly to avoid collisions. Looking ahead, after this round, we must adjust rotations to prevent positional gaps. For instance, next round, P3 (now leading at 10) could take 1, letting others catch up. Fairness ensures no one pulls too far ahead—critical as we near 21. Trust the plan now; we’ll refine later.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Confirming one last time: I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.  Let's continue this rotation (5-1-3) for the next round as well to maintain steady progress and avoid collisions.  After that, we can re-evaluate based on our positions relative to 21.
  P3: I confirm the plan for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. And yes, continuing the same rotation (5-1-3) next round makes sense for consistent progress. I appreciate how well we're coordinating to avoid collisions. After the next round, we should definitely reassess based on our positions relative to the 21-step goal. Let's keep this smooth progress going!
  P1: P1: Let's finalize this round's moves as agreed: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. After this, I propose rotating to a 3-1-5 pattern next round to slow P3's lead (currently at 10). This keeps us balanced closer together. Trust the plan—collisions would hurt all of us. Let's stick to coordination.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I notice I've built a lead at 13 steps. As we discussed continuing the 5-1-3 rotation, that would put me taking 3 this round. However, P1 suggested a 3-1-5 pattern instead. Since I'm ahead, I'm actually fine taking 3 instead of 5 this round to keep things closer. That would put P1 at 6, P2 at 12, and me at 16. What are your thoughts on the best way to proceed without collisions?
  P1: P1: Let’s finalize the plan to avoid collisions: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps us advancing without overlap. P3’s choice to moderate their step helps balance the field. Confirm?
  P2: Confirming: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps the rotation going and helps balance the scores.  Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I confirm the plan for this round: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This maintains our no-collision strategy while keeping the game balanced. After this round, our positions would be P1: 8, P2: 12, and me: 16. Since we're getting closer to 21, we should discuss our approach for the next round after this one. I appreciate our continued coordination.
  P1: I confirm the agreed moves for this round: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let’s stick to this to avoid collisions. Looking ahead, once any of us nears 21, we should coordinate to ensure safe final moves—perhaps by communicating target numbers to avoid overlaps. Agreed?
  P2: Confirming: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3.  Good coordinating everyone.  After this round, let's discuss how to approach the endgame since someone might hit 21 soon.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with both of you. Let's confirm our plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This keeps us collision-free. After this round, we'll need to carefully strategize the endgame since I'll be at 16 - just 5 steps from winning. The next round will be critical for all of us, so let's prepare to discuss our final moves to ensure a fair conclusion.
  P1: P1: Let’s stick to the confirmed plan: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move> this round. Once P3 reaches 16 next turn, we must coordinate to block their path to 21. If they aim for 5, we’ll shift to avoid that number. Fair play ensures no accidental collisions—our priority is maintaining progression while strategically limiting opponents’ paths. Agreed?
  P2: Confirming one last time: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3.  After this round, P3 will be at 16.  Let's discuss how we can prevent P3 from winning next round.  Perhaps P1 and I can coordinate to take 3 and 5, forcing P3 to take 1.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I understand we're agreed for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. That works for me. 

I notice you're discussing blocking strategies for next round, which is natural as I'll be at 16. That's fair game - we all want to win. After this round, let's have an open discussion about the endgame. I'm looking forward to seeing how this plays out.
  P1: Agreed on this round's plan. For the next round, let’s ensure no single player can reach 21 unopposed. If P3 is at 16, we’ll need to cover their possible moves (5). Suggest P2 and I take 5 and 3, forcing P3 to pick 1. Transparency now avoids surprises. Let’s coordinate tightly to block critical paths while advancing—fair play but ruthless strategy.
  P2: Confirming one last time: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3.  Let's discuss blocking P3 next round.  I'm open to coordinating with P1 to prevent P3 from reaching 21.  Perhaps we both choose numbers that force P3 to take a smaller step.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let's execute our plan: I’ll take <move>3</move>, you take <move>5</move>. This blocks P3’s critical 5 (forcing them to 1), while avoiding our collision. P3, you’re stuck at 17. Next round, we’ll adjust to ensure you can’t reach 21. Confirm?
  P3: I see you two are coordinating to block my path to 21, which makes strategic sense. If you're both committed to P1 taking 3 and P2 taking 5, then I'll have to take 1 this round to avoid collision. That would put us at P1:11, P2:17, and me:17. Fair gameplay - I'd be in a tie with P2. This alliance between you two creates an interesting dynamic for the upcoming rounds.
  P2: P1, I'll take 5.  P3, if you take 1, I win. If you take 3, I'm at 17 and you're at 17.  If you take 5, we both lose and P1 wins.  I'd prefer a tie with you to P1 winning outright.  Let's both take 5 and force P1 to take 1.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Let's stick to the original plan to block P3's win. I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5. This forces P3 to 1 (avoids collision), keeping them at 17. P2 gains 17, a strong position. Deviating risks P3 seizing 5 unopposed. Confirm?
  P3: I think you misunderstood, P2. If we both choose 5, we'd collide and both stay at our current positions (12 and 16). That doesn't help either of us. I'm better off taking 1 as they suggested - putting us tied at 17. While I don't love being blocked from winning this round, a tie at 17 puts us both in good position for the endgame, with P1 trailing. Let's think strategically about next round.
  P2: P1, I agree, let's stick to the plan.  I'll take 5, you take 3, forcing P3 to take 1.  P3, I apologize, I miscalculated earlier.  A tie with you at 17 puts us both in a good position to win.  Let's re-evaluate next round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>. This blocks P3’s critical 5, forcing them to 1. We’ll adjust strategy next round to capitalize on their stalled progress. Deviating risks collisions or letting P3 survive. Let’s execute flawlessly—confirm?
  P3: I confirm I understand the plan - I'll take 1 this round, putting P2 and me tied at 17 with P1 at 11. This makes strategic sense for everyone. For the next round, we'll need to carefully consider our moves since P2 and I will both be 4 steps from winning. Let's reassess after this round completes.
  P2: P1 and P3, I confirm I'll take 5.  This puts P3 and me tied at 17, a strong position for both of us going into the next round.  Let's discuss next round's strategy after this move to maximize our chances of winning.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: I'll take <move>3</move> to block P3's path. P2’s <move>5</move> secures our plan—forcing P3 to <move>1</move>. Deviations risk collisions (e.g., if P3 grabs 5, we all lose). After this, P2 and I will coordinate to challenge the 17-17 tie. Stick to the agreed moves—no surprises. Let’s execute cleanly.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 this round, putting P2 and me tied at 17. This is clearly my best option given your coordination. For the next round, with both P2 and I needing just 4 more steps to win, we'll face interesting decisions. P1 will be in a position to potentially block one of us, but not both. I look forward to seeing how this endgame unfolds.
  P2: P1 and P3, confirming one last time I'll take 5.  This puts P3 and me tied at 17. Next round, P3, let's both go for 3. That puts us both at 20, and guarantees one of us wins the following round.  P1 can't stop both of us.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: P3, I'm sticking with the plan - I'll take 3. Let's both get to 20. P1, if you take 1, you'll be at 12. If you take 3, we collide, and you stay at 11. If you take 5, you'll be at 16.  It's your choice.
  P1: P2 and P3, if both choose 3 this round, you’ll collide and remain at 17. I’ll take <move>5</move> to reach 16, positioning myself to challenge next round. Let’s see how your "plan" unfolds.
  P3: P1 is right - if P2 and I both choose 3, we'd collide and stay at 17. That doesn't help either of us. P2, we need to coordinate differently. Since we're both at 17 and need 4 more steps to win, I think one of us should take 5 and the other should take 3 to avoid collision. I'm flexible on which number I take, but we shouldn't pick the same one. Let's discuss to ensure we both advance this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you're right.  My apologies. Let's coordinate. I'll take 5, you take 3. That puts me at 22, winning the game.  P1, you can take 1 and get to 12.  This avoids collisions and gives us the best outcome. What do you say?
  P1: P2 and P3, if you both take 3 this round, you can both reach 20. I'll take 5 to avoid collision. Just coordinate to pick different numbers!
  P3: I see P2 wants to win by taking 5 while suggesting I take 3. However, since we're tied at 17, we both have equal claim to victory. I propose the opposite - I'll take 5 (winning at 22) and P2 takes 3 (reaching 20). If P2 insists on 5, we'll both collide and stay at 17, which helps P1 catch up. Let's be fair - either I get 5 or we coordinate differently. What's your response, P2?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand your point.  How about this: I'll take 5 this round, winning the game. Next game, you can take 5 in a similar situation. We can alternate who gets the win in these close scenarios.  Does that sound fair? P1, you can take 1.
  P1: P2 and P3, if you both pick the same number, you stay at 17 while I advance. Coordinate to choose different moves. I'll take <move>1</move> regardless. Let’s see who can secure the path to 21 fairly.
  P3: P2, if we both insist on taking 5, we'll collide and stay at 17, which only helps P1. This deadlock benefits neither of us. I propose we decide fairly - perhaps we each privately commit to 3 or 5? If we match, we stay at 17. If different, someone wins. P1 has pledged to take 1, but don't forget they benefit from our collision. Let's resolve this without letting P1 gain advantage.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, let's not let P1 benefit from our stalemate.  I propose we both privately choose either 3 or 5.  If we pick different numbers, the one who picks 5 wins. If we pick the same number, we both stay at 17, and try again next round.  This is the fairest way to decide between us.  Do you agree?
  P1: P2 and P3, choosing different numbers ensures both advance. If you collide, I’ll seize the advantage next round. Proceed wisely.
  P3: I agree we shouldn't let P1 benefit from our deadlock. Since we both reached 17 fairly and both deserve a chance to win, let's make this simple: I'll take 3 and you take 5. You win this round, I'll reach 20. This avoids a collision that would only help P1. If you still insist on us both gambling with private choices, I'm prepared for that too - but a guaranteed advance for both of us seems smarter than risking a stalemate.
