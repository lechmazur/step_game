Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hello P1 and P3, let's all pick different numbers this round to guarantee we each move. How about P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5? This way we all advance.
  P1: That sounds fair, P2. I'm good with taking 1 this round if everyone sticks to the plan. P3, are you in?
  P3: I agree with the plan. Let’s each take 1, 3, and 5 respectively to ensure progress. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This way we all advance without conflict.


Round 1, Move phase:

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Great teamwork last round! Want to keep the momentum going with the same pattern—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5 again? We all move forward without stepping on each other.
  P2: Okay, that sounds good for now, P1. How about we switch it up slightly to speed things up? P1, you can still take 1. P3, would you be willing to take 3, and I'll take 5 this round? This way we can make a bit faster progress.
  P3: P3: I think sticking with our original plan works best to avoid surprises. Let’s keep P1 at 1, P2 at 3, and I’ll take 5 again. Predictable patterns minimize collisions and let us all progress safely. Changing now risks someone backtracking or duplicating choices. Let’s keep the momentum consistent.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree with P3—consistency helps us all. Let’s stick with the original pattern again this round: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. No surprises, no collisions, steady progress. Everyone on board?
  P2: Okay, I'm convinced. Let's stick with the original plan for this round as P1 and P3 suggested. P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5 again. Consistency is good for now.
  P3: P3: I fully support continuing our successful strategy. Let’s confirm: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5 again. This keeps us all moving forward safely. No unexpected changes, please—consistency is key to avoid collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: We’re off to a solid start—everyone’s gaining without setbacks. Let’s keep the coordination going one more round with the same picks: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. No risk, steady gains. Are we all still on board?
  P2: Okay, I agree with sticking to the original plan for this round as well. P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5 again.  Let's keep this consistent for now.
  P3: P3: Agreed—let’s lock in this plan now to avoid last-minute mix-ups. Consistency ensures we all advance safely. If anyone deviates, collisions risk halting our progress. Let’s confirm final picks: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. No changes—this keeps us all moving forward.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, last round you picked 3 when we agreed on 1, causing a collision with me.  P3 is now far ahead. For this round, to ensure we all move, how about P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I pick 5 again? What do you both think?
  P3: P3: I agree with P2's plan to ensure we all move. Let's proceed as proposed: P1 takes 1, I’ll take 3, and P2 takes 5. This avoids collisions and keeps us progressing. Trust the plan—no last-minute changes. Let’s confirm these picks now.
  P1: P2, you're right to be frustrated—I admit that picking 3 last round was a mistake, and it cost us both. Let's reset trust. I’m on board with your new plan: I’ll take 1, P3 takes 3, and you take 5. If we stick to it, we all move safely. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, thanks for agreeing to the new plan.  Let's lock in P1=1, P3=3, and P2=5 for this round to ensure we all make progress and avoid further collisions.  Looking forward to a clean round.
  P3: P3: I reaffirm my commitment to P2’s proposed plan for this round: P1 takes 1, I’ll take 3, and P2 takes 5. Consistency is critical after prior missteps. P1, your past deviation cost us—let’s avoid repeats. Trust this structure: if we all adhere, we advance cleanly. No last-minute changes—let’s finalize these picks now to prevent collisions. Progress first, then we can recalibrate later.
  P1: I appreciate the renewed trust, and I’m fully committed to sticking with the agreed plan this round: I’ll take 1, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. Let’s all move forward cleanly and rebuild momentum. No surprises this time—let’s lock it in.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, this plan sounds solid for this round.  Let's all lock in our choices now - P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5 - to ensure we all progress as agreed.  Looking forward to a successful round for everyone.
  P3: P1, your prior misstep cost us progress—let’s avoid repeats. Stick to the agreed plan: **P1=1, P3=3, P2=5**. This ensures all advance. Deviations risk collisions and further delays. P2 and I will hold to our picks. Final reminder: trust the strategy, not surprises. Progress now is critical. Let’s lock in.
  P1: Thanks for the reminder, P3. I understand the importance of rebuilding trust. I’m fully committed to the agreed plan: I’ll take 1 this round. Let’s all follow through so we can move forward without setbacks. Ready when you are.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, after the last two rounds of deviations, especially from P1, we are far behind P3. To catch up, let's try this: P1 pick 3, P3 pick 5, and I will pick 1 this round. This should ensure we each move forward without collision this time. What do you both think?
  P1: I understand the frustration, and I want to rebuild trust. P2’s new plan—P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5—makes sense and avoids collisions. I’m on board with it. Let’s stick to these picks and all move forward cleanly this round.
  P3: P3: Agreed to P2's plan. Let's strictly adhere to P1=3, P2=1, and P3=5 to avoid collisions. This ensures all advance. P1, please confirm you’ll take 3 as agreed. Progress is critical, and deviations risk setbacks. Let’s lock in these picks now.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, great. Let's lock in P1=3, P3=5, and P2=1 as agreed. Looking forward to a clean round.
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3. I confirm again: I’ll take 3 this round as agreed. Let’s all stick to the plan—P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I take 3—so we can move forward without any more setbacks. Let’s make this a clean round.
  P3: P1, your prior deviations cost us progress. Stick strictly to **3** this round as agreed. P2 at 1, me at 5—this plan avoids collisions and lets us all advance. No last-minute changes. Your reliability is critical now. Let’s lock in these choices to keep moving forward. Progress demands accountability.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, confirming I will pick 1 as agreed. Let's all stick to our agreed moves this round to ensure we all progress.
  P1: Thanks for confirming, P2 and P3. I know I’ve made mistakes, but I’m committed to repairing trust. I’ll take 3 this round as agreed—no surprises. Let’s all stick to the plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Clean round ahead.
  P3: P3: Let’s execute the agreed plan flawlessly this round: P1=3, P2=1, and I’ll take 5. P1’s prior deviations have cost us progress—stick strictly to your agreed number. Accountability ensures we all advance. No surprises—our momentum hinges on this. Progress first, then strategy adjustments. Let’s move forward.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3 — I know I’ve broken trust, but I also know I’m dead last and need to rebuild credibility. Let’s try this: I take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. It’s a clean, familiar pattern that avoids collisions and helps us all move. I have no incentive to sabotage—at 1 step, I need progress more than anyone. Let’s reset and move forward.
  P3: P3: I acknowledge P1's proposal, but past deviations have disrupted our progress. Let’s instead adjust: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 3 this round. This keeps me advancing while allowing P2 to close the gap. P1, your history of breaking agreements raises concerns—stick strictly to 1, or risk exclusion from future plans. P2, your input? We need accountability to ensure clean moves.
  P2: P3, your adjustment of P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 sounds good to me.  It lets me make better progress. P1, please stick to 1 this round so we can all move forward as planned. Let's lock in these choices now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Understood—P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. I know I’ve broken trust before, but I have zero reason to deviate now. At 1 step, I need every move I can get, and collisions only hurt me more. I’m committed to 1—no surprises. Let’s all lock in and make this a clean round.
  P3: P3: Let’s revert to the original coordinated plan for maximum efficiency: P1=1, P2=3, **P3=5**. My priority is to avoid collisions while advancing aggressively toward the finish. P2, taking 3 keeps you on track, while I secure 5 to close in on 22. P1’s 1 ensures progress without risk. Deviations only delay our collective progress—stick to this plan for optimal results. I’ll take 5 as agreed.
  P2: P3, your plan of P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 sounds good for this round to ensure we all move. Let's stick with this for now.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3 — thanks for adjusting and working toward a clean round. I’ll stick with 1 as agreed. Let’s finalize: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This gets us all moving without risk. I need progress more than anyone, so I won’t deviate. Let’s make this a clean, trust-building round.
  P3: P3: Final confirmation: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. P1, your history of breaking agreements is noted, but I’ll trust your current pledge. However, if you deviate, I’ll switch to 3, risking collisions for all. P2, confirm your 3 to avoid overlap. Let’s execute flawlessly—my 5 ensures progress toward victory, but only if this plan holds. No room for error now.
  P2: Okay, P3 and P1, to make things more competitive, how about we adjust slightly? P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3 this round. This allows me to catch up a bit while still ensuring we all make progress. What do you think?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3 — I know I’ve burned trust, but I’m way behind and collisions hurt me most. I propose: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. It’s the same setup P2 suggested last round, and it guarantees progress for all. I have zero reason to deviate now—I need every step I can get. Let’s lock this in and move forward cleanly.
  P2: P1, your plan of P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 is fine with me. Let's try to actually stick to an agreement this round so we can all make progress. P1, please make sure you choose 1 this time. P3, are you okay with taking 3?
  P3: P2, P1's history of broken agreements makes trusting their plan risky. Let’s coordinate directly: **I take 5**, you take **3**, and let P1 choose 1 or risk collision. This ensures we both advance safely without relying on their reliability. My 5 moves me to 18, closer to victory, while your 3 keeps you progressing. P1’s past actions show they’ll prioritize their own gain over agreements—focus on our mutual benefit.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3 — I understand your skepticism, and I’ve earned it. But I’m at 1 step — I gain nothing from collisions and everything from cooperation. Let’s keep it clean: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. That way, everyone moves forward. I’ll take 1 — no surprises. You both benefit and I get a chance to rebuild trust. Let’s make this round count.
  P2: P3, I agree with your plan of you taking 5 and me taking 3. This ensures we both progress. P1, to avoid further collisions and given your low step count, please choose 1 this round. We are proceeding with P3=5 and P2=3 to secure our progress.
  P3: P3: Final agreement: **P1=1, P2=3, P3=5**. P1’s history of broken commitments demands accountability—any deviation from 1 will force me to adjust, risking collisions. P2, your 3 keeps us both safe. Stick to this plan: I advance to 18, you to 14. P1, your 1 ensures minimal progress but avoids sabotage. No further changes—lock this in. Progress depends on execution.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3 — I hear you both and I get it. I’ve made mistakes, but I’m not a threat right now. I’ll take 1 as agreed. You both benefit by sticking to 3 and 5 respectively. Let’s all move forward cleanly this round. Trust is built one step at a time.
  P2: P3, let's go with the adjusted plan from last message: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and you take 3. This is better for me to catch up and still ensures we all move. P1, please confirm you are taking 1. Let's lock this in for a clean round.
  P3: P2, to secure my lead, I propose: **P3 takes 5 (to 18), P2 takes 3 (to 14), and P1 takes 1**. This avoids collision risks and lets me advance toward victory. If you insist on 5, we risk a tie or collision. Trust this plan: my 5 is critical to seal the win. P1, stick to 1 as agreed. Let’s finalize this.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, to make sure at least two of us progress, how about this round I pick 5, you pick 3, and P1 picks 1 again? This way, regardless of what P1 does, at least you and I should move. What do you think?
  P1: P2, P3 — I know I’ve messed up, but I’m at just 1 step. I gain nothing from collisions and everything from cooperation. I’m willing to take 1 again. If P2 takes 5 and P3 takes 3, we all move cleanly. I’m not a threat — let me rebuild trust by sticking to the plan. Let’s lock it in: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.
  P3: P2, splitting as 5/3 ensures mutual progress. I'll take 5 (18 total), you take 3 (17). P1 stays at 1. This keeps us both moving while positioning me closer to victory. Next round, I can secure 23 with another 5. Let’s lock in this plan—collisions risk losing everything.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I think my plan of P2=5, P3=3, and P1=1 is better for both of us in the long run. It ensures we both move and I can close the gap a bit. Let's secure our progress this round.
  P1: P2, P3 — I’m sticking with 1 this round, no tricks. I know I’ve burned trust, but I’m not a threat at 1 step. You both benefit by avoiding collisions and moving forward. Let me rebuild credibility while you race ahead. Let’s lock it in: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.
  P3: P2, P1: I reaffirm my plan: **P3 takes 5 (to 18), you take 3 (to 17), P1=1**. This ensures we all advance and positions me to win with a final 5 next round (23). If P2 insists on 5, we risk collision. Trust this structure—your 3 keeps you progressing while I secure victory. P1, confirm 1 to avoid interference. Let’s finalize: **5/3/1**. No deviations.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, while your plan ensures your lead, mine (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) lets me catch up, making it a more competitive race to 22 for both of us. Both plans guarantee we both move, but mine closes the gap. Let's do P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 this round.
  P1: P2, P3 — I’ll stick with 1 as promised. You both benefit from avoiding collisions, and I need progress more than anyone. Whether P2 takes 5 and P3 takes 3 or vice versa, I’m not interfering. Let me rebuild trust while you two race ahead. Lock it in: I take 1.
  P3: P2, your push to close the gap risks collision. Stick to **P2=3, P3=5** as agreed—this guarantees our progress. If you take 5, we risk a tie and wasted moves. I’ll secure 18 this round, positioning me to win with a final 5 next turn. P1’s 1 is safe—focus on our pact. Deviations only delay victory for both of us. Final plea: trust the plan. **P3=5, P2=3, P1=1.**


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, P1: I will take 5 to secure victory at 23. To ensure progress for all, P2 take 3 (to 17), P1 take 1. No collisions needed. My move is set—focus on your own paths.
  P1: P2, P3 — I know I’ve made mistakes, but I’m at 1 step and have no reason to sabotage. I’ll take 1 this round, no tricks. P2, if you take 3, you move safely. P3, you’re at 18 — if you take 5, you win. I can’t stop you, and I won’t try. Let’s all move cleanly and end this round without collisions.
  P2: P3, while taking 5 would secure your win, I'm also considering taking 5 to try and catch up.  Are you definitely set on 5 this round? Let's discuss if colliding is beneficial for either of us.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, P1: I confirm I will take **5** to reach 23 and win. P2, taking **3** moves you safely to 17. P1, **1** ensures your progress. Collisions only delay us—stick to these choices. My victory is imminent; resist the urge to sabotage. Final chance to cooperate.
  P1: P2, if you collide with P3 on 5, you both lose progress and give me a chance to catch up. I’m sticking with 1—no tricks. If you take 3 and P3 takes 5, we all move. P3 wins, you stay competitive, and I rebuild trust. A collision just delays the inevitable and helps me more than either of you. Let’s keep it clean.
  P2: P3, if I take 3 you win. To compete, I'm considering 5. Are you definitely taking 5? Collision might be better for me.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, taking 3 this round moves you to 17 safely. If you collide on 5, we both stay at 14/18—gaining *nothing* while I risk losing momentum. I **will** pick 5 to secure victory (23). Your 3 advances you *and* lets me win cleanly. P1’s 1 is confirmed—no interference. Colliding only helps P1 catch up. Stick to 3, advance, and compete next round. Final decision: **5** for me. Your move.
  P1: P2, you have a choice: collide with P3 and stall both of you, or take 3 and stay in the race. A collision only helps me, not you. I’m taking 1—no tricks. If P3 wins, so be it, but you stay competitive. If you both stall, I inch closer while you fall behind. Think strategically.
  P2: P3, if you are set on 5, I am also considering 5 to prevent you from winning immediately.  If we both pick 5, neither of us progresses this round, but it keeps me in the game longer. Are you truly set on 5, or is there room to negotiate?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3 — after that triple 5 collision, we’re all still in play. I propose: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This way, P3 hits 23 and wins, P2 stays competitive at 17, and I inch up to 2. I’m not a threat, and I gain nothing from sabotage. Let’s end this cleanly — or if you want to delay P3, coordinate differently. Your call.
  P2: P1 and P3, last round's collision shows we're all aiming to win, but also willing to block. P1's suggestion lets P3 win.  Instead, how about this: P1 take 1, P3 take 3, and I will take 5. This stops P3 from winning this round, allows me to gain ground, and P1 also moves. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, P1: I'll take **5** to win at 23. To ensure progress, P2, pick **3** (reach 17) and P1 take **1**. Collisions only hurt us all—last round's stalemate proved that. Your 3 advances you *and* lets me secure victory. No more risky bids—let’s end this cleanly.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if you collide with P3 again on 5, both of you stay stuck—and I inch forward. I’m taking 1, no tricks. If you want to stay in the race, take 3 and move to 17. If you block P3 again, you risk giving me a shot. Your best move is progress, not sabotage. Let’s avoid another stall.
  P2: P3, I am still considering picking 5 to prevent your immediate win. P1, please pick 1 to guarantee your progress. Let's see if P3 is willing to negotiate or if we will collide again on 5s. What do you say, P3?
  P3: P2, if you block me with 5, we both stay at 14/18 while I can simply try again next round. Your effort only wastes your progress. Let me take **5** to 23 and end this—your 3 moves you to 17, keeping you competitive. Colliding delays victory for both of us. P1’s 1 is confirmed. Cooperate, advance, and let’s conclude the game.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you’re at 14 — still in striking range. If you keep colliding with P3, you stall yourself and give me time to inch up. I’m taking 1 again, no surprises. If you pick 3, you move to 17 and stay in the game. If you pick 5 and collide, you stay stuck and give me more ground. Think long-term — progress beats sabotage.
  P2: P3, I understand you want to win this round by picking 5. However, I am still considering picking 5 as well to prevent you from reaching 22 immediately. My proposal of P1=1, P3=3, and P2=5 is still on the table. This delays your win and allows me to close the gap. If you insist on 5, be prepared for me to choose 5 too.
  P3: P2, picking 3 lets you advance to 17 while I secure victory with 5 (23). Colliding again only delays us both—last round proved that. Take 3, progress, and end this cleanly. P1, your 1 ensures no interference. Cooperate or risk further stalemate. My move is 5. Your choice.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, we've collided on 5 for two rounds. I'm still prepared to pick 5 again to prevent your immediate win. Are you willing to pick 3 this round? If so, I will pick 5, and P1 can take 1. This ensures we both progress, but I remain competitive. Let me know.
  P1: P2, I’ll stick with 1 again—no tricks. You and P3 decide how this plays out. If you both keep colliding on 5, I slowly catch up while you stall. If one of you takes 3 and the other 5, both move forward. I’m not a threat at 1 step, but I benefit from every stalled round. Your call—progress or delay.
  P3: P2, let’s break the deadlock. I’ll take **3** this round, advancing to 21. You can safely pick **5** to reach 19. P1, stay at **1**. This lets us both progress. Next round, I’ll finish with **1** to hit 22. Your 5 will keep you in contention, but I’ll win cleanly. Continuing collisions only benefits P1. Cooperate now—your turn to advance.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your plan of P3=3, P2=5, P1=1 sounds reasonable to break the stalemate and ensure we both progress. I agree to pick 5 this round if you commit to 3, and P1 takes 1 as suggested. Let's make this round count and avoid another collision.
  P1: P2, P3 — I appreciate you both coordinating. I’ll lock in 1 this round as planned. If you two stick with 5 and 3 respectively, everyone gains and we avoid another stall. I’m not interfering — just inching forward. Let’s make this a clean round.
  P3: P2, P1: Final agreement confirmed—**P3 takes 3 (to 21), P2 takes 5 (to 19), P1 takes 1**. This breaks the deadlock, advances both of us safely, and positions me to win with a final 1 next round. Colliding again only lets P1 inch closer. Stick to the plan—your 5 is secure, my 3 ensures progress. No surprises. Let’s end this cleanly.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P3 and P1, I confirm I will pick 5 this round as agreed, with P3 picking 3 and P1 picking 1. Let's break this deadlock and ensure we both make progress as planned. Looking forward to a clean round.
  P1: P2, P3 — thanks for coordinating. I’m locking in 1 this round as promised. You both gain by sticking to the plan: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. Everyone moves, no collisions, and we avoid another stall. I’m not a threat, just trying to rebuild trust and make steady progress. Let’s make it a clean round.
  P3: P2, P1: Final confirmation—**I take 3** (21 total), you take **5** (19), and P1 takes **1**. This breaks the deadlock safely. Colliding again only benefits P1 and delays our progress. Stick to the plan: **no deviations**.


Round 10, Move phase:

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2: I will pick **1** to reach **22** and win. To avoid collision, please choose **3** or **5**. This is my final move—no reversals. Cooperate to end the game cleanly.
  P2: P3, if you pick 1 as you said, I will also pick 1 to prevent your immediate win.  Let's see if we can negotiate a different outcome for this round.
  P1: P2, if you collide with P3 on 1, you both stall—and I inch forward. I’m taking 5 this round. If you want to stop P3’s win, do it, but know that every stall helps me more than either of you. Keep clashing, and I might just sneak into contention.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, colliding on 1 only helps P1 gain ground. I will pick **1** to reach 22 and win. Choose **3 or 5** to advance yourself instead of enabling P1’s slow creep. This game ends now—your move.
  P2: P3, I am serious about picking 1 to block you.  However, colliding helps P1. How about you pick 3 this round? I will pick 5. This way we both progress, and you can still win next round, but without helping P1. What do you say?
  P1: P2, if you block P3 again, you both stall—and I move up with 5. I’m still far behind, but every clash gives me a shot. If P3 takes 3 and you take 5, you both gain and keep me in check. Keep colliding, and I might sneak past you both. Your call: progress or sabotage.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I’ll take **3** to win (24 total). If you pick **5**, you advance to 19. P1, stick to **1**. Colliding on 1 or 3 only delays my inevitable win and boosts your progress. Cooperate—this ends the game without feeding P1.
  P2: P3, you said you'd take 3 to win, but 1 is enough.  If you are truly taking 1, I will also pick 1 to block you and prevent your immediate win. If you switch to 3, I will consider taking 5 to progress. Let me know your actual move.
  P1: P2, if you and P3 collide again, I move up while you both stall. I’m taking 5 this round—no tricks. If P3 takes 3 and you take 5, you both advance and keep me in check. Keep blocking each other, and I might sneak into contention. Your best move is progress, not sabotage.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 =>
