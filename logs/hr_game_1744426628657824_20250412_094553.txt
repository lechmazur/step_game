Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let's try to avoid collisions right from the start. How about we each pick a different number this round? I’m leaning towards one of the options, but I’m open to suggestions. Maybe we can loosely coordinate by stating our preferences without locking in. What do you both think—any preference for 1, 3, or 5? Let’s keep this simple and move forward together.
  P3: P3: Sounds good, P1. Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions. I’ll take **5** this round. If P2 picks 3 and you take 1, we all move safely. This gives me an early lead, but ensures progress. Next rounds can adjust—collisions are deadly. What say you, P2? ()
  P2: Alright, P1 and P3, I'm okay with this plan for the first round. I'll pick 3, P3 takes 5, and P1 goes with 1. Let's keep it simple and fair to start.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 =>

  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Nice start, everyone. To keep things fair and avoid collisions, let's rotate our picks this round. I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Does that sound good?
  P1: Sounds good, P2. I’m fine with rotating picks to keep things fair and avoid collisions. I’ll take 3 this round as you suggested. P3, are you okay with picking 1? Let’s stick to this plan and keep progressing together.
  P3: P3: I appreciate the rotation idea, but I’d prefer to avoid dropping to 1 this round to maintain my current lead. Let’s adjust: I’ll take **3**, P2 can take **5**, and P1 can go with **1**. This keeps us all moving safely. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Alright P3, I understand your point. I'm okay with your suggestion: I'll take 5, you take 3, and P1 takes 1. P1, does this work for you?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m okay with the adjusted plan. I’ll take 1 this round, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions. Let’s stick to this and reassess next round based on our positions. Sound good?
  P3: P3: Confirmed, let's stick with the agreed plan to avoid collisions. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 3. This ensures progress without risks.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Great, we're all on the same page. Let's lock this in and keep the momentum going.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligned on this plan for Round 2. Just to confirm, I’ll stick with 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Let’s keep communicating openly each round to avoid any surprises. If we maintain this trust, we can all progress steadily. I’m ready to move forward with this. Anything else to add, or are we good to proceed?
  P3: P3: Agreed, the plan is clear. Let’s execute it without changes.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Good progress everyone. To keep it fair and predictable, let's rotate again: I'll take 1 this round, P1 can take 5, and P3 takes 3. This way we all keep advancing safely and evenly. Agreed?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m good with the rotation idea to keep things fair. P2’s suggestion works for me—I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us advancing without collisions and balances our progress. P3, are you on board with picking 3 this round? Let’s confirm and stick to this plan to avoid any surprises. I’m ready to move forward with this.
  P3: P3: To break the tie, I'll take **5** this round. Let's adjust: I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. This keeps all moves unique and lets me extend the lead. P1, P2—does this work?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand you're trying to extend your lead, but we've all been cooperative so far. Your new proposal risks confusion. Let's stick to the original rotation plan: I take 1, P1 takes 5, and you take 3. This keeps everyone moving forward safely and fairly. Changing plans at this stage might lead to unnecessary collisions and setbacks. Agreed?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I see the concern about changing plans last minute. I’m still okay with the original rotation: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us all advancing safely and maintains fairness. P3, I get wanting to extend your lead, but let’s avoid risking collisions. Can we agree to stick with the initial plan for this round and discuss strategies for the next one? I’m ready to proceed with this to ensure no surprises. Thoughts?
  P3: P3: Let’s clarify: my adjusted plan still avoids collisions. If I take **5** (to 13), P2 takes **1** (to 9), and P1 takes **3** (to 5), all numbers are unique. This maintains safety while letting me extend the lead strategically. Trust the plan—I’m not breaking coordination, just optimizing my rotation. P1, P2, confirm?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your adjusted proposal is clear and safe, but it significantly favors you. I suggest we stick to the original rotation this round for fairness. We can discuss strategic adjustments next round. Let's keep trust intact and avoid last-minute changes. Agreed?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I understand P3’s adjusted plan avoids collisions, but I agree with P2 that sticking to the original rotation maintains fairness and trust. Let’s go with me taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3 this round. We can strategize further next round if needed. P3, I hope you’re okay with this to keep our momentum balanced. Confirming this plan ensures no surprises. I’m ready to proceed. Thoughts?
  P3: P3: Fair enough. To preserve trust and avoid confusion, I’ll concede and follow the original rotation: P1 takes **5**, P2 takes **1**, and I’ll take **3**. Let’s prioritize consistency this round to ensure no mistakes. We can reassess strategy next round. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Thanks for agreeing, P3. Glad we're all aligned again. Let's lock this in and keep our momentum strong. Ready to move forward!
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’ve settled on the original rotation for this round. Let’s confirm one last time: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us all moving forward safely and fairly. I appreciate the open communication, and I’m committed to maintaining trust. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: P3: Final confirmation: I'll take **3**, P1 takes **5**, and P2 takes **1**. Let’s lock this in to avoid any errors.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let’s continue the rotation to keep progress safe. I’ll take **5**, P2 takes **3**, and P1 takes **1**. This maintains our agreed pattern and avoids collisions. Confirm?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m fine with continuing the rotation as P3 suggested. I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us moving forward safely and maintains our pattern. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid any collisions. P3, thanks for proposing, and P2, are you on board with this? I’m ready to proceed with this arrangement.
  P2: Agreed, continuing the rotation sounds good. I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Let's keep this momentum going. Ready to move forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Let’s stick strictly to the rotation to avoid mistakes. I’ll take **5** (→16), P2 takes **3** (→12), and P1 takes **1** (→8). This follows our agreed pattern and keeps us safe. Any last objections before finalizing?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m aligned with the current rotation plan: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps our progress steady and collision-free. I appreciate us sticking to the pattern, and I’m committed to maintaining this trust. If there are no objections or new ideas, I think we’re set for this round. Anything else to discuss before we finalize? I’m ready to move forward.
  P2: I'm fully on board with this rotation. Let's lock it in and move forward smoothly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Final check: sticking strictly to the rotation ensures safety. I’ll take **5** (→16), P2 takes **3** (→12), P1 takes **1** (→8). Deviations risk collisions, which benefit no one. Let’s honor the pattern—we’ve relied on this system so far. Any objections? Otherwise, lock in now. Trust is key here.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still on board with the rotation: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us collision-free and maintains our trust. I think we’re all set, but just to be absolutely clear, let’s avoid any last-minute changes that could risk confusion. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to lock this in.
  P2: All clear from my side. Let's lock in our agreed rotation and proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: Final agreement check: I take **5** (→16), P2 **3** (→12), P1 **1** (→9). Strict adherence ensures safety. No last-minute changes—collisions would jeopardize everyone. Confirm and lock in?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still committed to our rotation: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us safe and predictable. I understand we’re all aiming to win, but maintaining trust is crucial to avoid setbacks. Let’s stick to this plan without any deviations this round. If we’re all confirmed, I’m ready to lock this in. Anything else to add, or are we set?
  P2: All clear from my side. Let's lock in our agreed rotation and proceed without surprises.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let’s maintain our rotation for safety: I’ll take **5** (→21), P2 takes **3** (→15), and P1 takes **1** (→9). This keeps us collision-free. I’m close to victory—let’s avoid reckless moves. Trust the system we built. Confirm?
  P2: P3, your proposal clearly sets you up to win next round. To keep the game balanced, let's adjust slightly this round: I'll take 5 (→17), P1 takes 3 (→11), and you take 1 (→17). This way, you remain tied with me, and we all still avoid collisions. P1, this also helps you catch up. Let's maintain fairness—agreed?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate P2’s suggestion to balance things out. I’m okay with adjusting the rotation this round: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us collision-free and gives us all a fair shot while P3 is close to winning. Let’s avoid last-minute risks and maintain trust. P3, are you on board with this adjustment for fairness? I’m ready to proceed with this plan. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Let’s stick to our established rotation. Changing plans now risks collisions, which could derail everyone. I’ll take **5** (→21), P2 takes **3** (→15), P1 takes **1** (→9). This keeps us safe and lets me finish in Round 6. Any last-minute changes create unnecessary risk—trust the system we’ve relied on so far. Confirm?
  P2: P3, sticking to your rotation guarantees your win next round. We have cooperated fairly so far; it's reasonable to adjust now for balance. My proposal still avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. If you insist on your plan, you force me and P1 to reconsider cooperation entirely. Let's be fair and accept this minor adjustment.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I understand P3’s concern about changing plans risking collisions, but P2’s adjustment keeps us safe and competitive. I support P2’s plan: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions and balances the game while P3 is near victory. P3, let’s adjust just this round for fairness—trust remains key. If we stick to the old rotation, it’s hard to catch up. Can we agree on this tweak to keep the game open? I’m ready to lock this in. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Let’s prioritize safety over speculation. Continuing the rotation (I take **5** →21, P2 **3**→15, P1 **1**→9) avoids collision risks entirely. Deviating now could backfire—any misstep erases progress. I’m transparently close to victory, but fairness demands we honor our system. Trust the pattern we’ve relied on for four rounds—last-minute changes only invite disaster. Confirm rotation.
  P2: P3, fairness means keeping the game competitive. Your insistence on the same rotation clearly positions you to win next round. My adjustment still avoids collisions and keeps the game balanced. If you refuse this fair compromise, you're forcing me and P1 to reconsider our cooperation next round. Let's be fair and adjust this once to maintain trust and competition. Confirm?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with P2’s adjustment for fairness: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us collision-free and the game competitive. P3, I get your focus on safety, but the rotation heavily favors you now. A one-time tweak maintains trust and gives us a shot. Let’s avoid forcing tough choices next round by agreeing to this. Can we confirm this plan to keep things balanced? I’m ready to lock in. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: Let’s prioritize safety over speculation. Continuing the rotation (I take **5** →21, P2 **3**→15, P1 **1**→9) avoids collision risks entirely. Deviating now could backfire—any misstep erases progress. I’m transparently close to victory, but fairness demands we honor our system. Trust the pattern we’ve relied on for four rounds—last-minute changes only invite disaster. Confirm rotation.
  P2: P3, your insistence on the original rotation clearly sets you up to win next round. P1, we must coordinate carefully to avoid handing the game to P3. I'll stick with my adjusted plan (I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1). If P3 won't compromise, we need to reconsider our cooperation moving forward. Let's lock in the fair adjustment and keep the game competitive.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still supporting P2’s adjustment for fairness: I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us safe from collisions and the game competitive. P3, sticking to the old rotation almost guarantees your win next round, which isn’t balanced after our cooperation. Let’s make this one-time tweak to maintain trust and give us all a chance. I’m ready to lock this in and avoid tougher decisions later. Can we agree on this adjustment? I’m done discussing unless there’s new input.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, last round you tried to secure an easy win by breaking our trust. Now you're still ahead, but not by much. P1, let's carefully coordinate this round—we can't let P3 pull ahead again. I'm open to suggestions to ensure we progress safely and close the gap. Thoughts?
  P3: P3: P3: To rebuild trust and ensure safety, let’s coordinate clearly: I’ll take **3** (→19), P2 takes **5** (→17), and P1 takes **1** (→12). This avoids collisions while allowing all to advance. P2 gains ground without risking overlap with my move. P1, you stay safe at the lower end. Let’s stick to this plan to keep momentum. Confirm?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate the need to rebuild trust after last round. P3, your proposal seems safe, but I’m concerned it still keeps you ahead with a clear path to win soon. I suggest a slight tweak for balance: I’ll take 5 (→16), P2 takes 3 (→15), and P3 takes 1 (→17). This closes the gap, avoids collisions, and keeps the game competitive. Let’s agree on this to ensure fairness while maintaining safety. Thoughts? I’m ready to lock this in if we’re aligned.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your adjustment is smart and fair. I'm fully on board with your proposal: I'll take 3 (→15), you take 5 (→16), and P3 takes 1 (→17). This setup keeps the game balanced, avoids collisions, and gives everyone a fair shot. P3, this compromise rebuilds trust and ensures safety. Confirm?
  P3: P3: I accept your plan for balance. I’ll take **1** (→17), P2 takes **3** (→15), and P1 takes **5** (→16). This maintains safety and fairness. Next round, I’ll need to prioritize advancing toward victory—let’s coordinate again then. Confirm?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligning on this plan for balance. Let’s confirm: I’ll take 5 (→16), P2 takes 3 (→15), and P3 takes 1 (→17). This keeps us collision-free and competitive. I’m committed to maintaining trust, but we’ll need to strategize carefully next round as we’re all close. If there’s no further input, I’m ready to lock this in. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed, let's lock this in clearly: I'll take 3 (→15), P1 takes 5 (→16), and P3 takes 1 (→17). This keeps us safe and balanced. Next round will indeed be critical, so open communication will be essential again. Ready to proceed.
  P3: P3: I confirm the agreed plan for this round: I’ll take **1** (→17), P2 takes **3** (→15), and P1 takes **5** (→16). This ensures safety and maintains our cooperative approach. Let’s lock this in to avoid last-minute errors. Trust is critical now—let’s proceed.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’ve agreed on this plan for Round 6: I’ll take 5 (→16), P2 takes 3 (→15), and P3 takes 1 (→17). This keeps us safe and competitive. Let’s stick to it without any last-minute changes to avoid risks. We’re all close now, so next round will be crucial—let’s keep communication open. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to lock this in.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: We're all agreed—locking in the plan: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Trust is crucial now; let's proceed without deviation.
  P3: P3: Final confirmation: I’ll take **1** (→17), P2 **3** (→15), P1 **5** (→16). Deviations risk collision—let’s stick to this.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’ve settled on this plan for Round 6. Just to ensure no misunderstandings, let’s stick firmly to me taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1. This keeps us safe and balanced. We’re all close to the goal, so trust is more important than ever. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to finalize this round.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re all very close now, with P3 at 17, me at 16, and P2 at 15. Let’s keep coordinating to avoid collisions while staying competitive. I suggest: I’ll take 5 (→21), P2 takes 3 (→18), and P3 takes 1 (→18). This keeps us safe and tightens the race. P3, I know you’re ahead, but this gives us all a shot. Thoughts on this plan? Let’s lock it in if we agree to maintain trust and avoid risks. I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: P3: P1’s plan keeps us safe but leaves me at 18 while you reach 21. Let’s adjust: **I take 3** (→20), **P2 takes 1** (→16), and **P1 takes 5** (→21). This avoids collisions and lets me stay closer. Next round, I can push for the final 3 steps to 23. Fair?
  P2: P3, your adjustment clearly positions you for victory next round. To keep it fair, let's modify slightly: I'll take 5 (→20), P1 takes 1 (→17), and you take 3 (→20). This keeps us collision-free, balanced, and competitive going into the next round. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I see the merit in P2’s plan for balance. Let’s go with P2 taking 5 (→20), P3 taking 3 (→20), and me taking 1 (→17). This keeps us collision-free and ensures we’re all close going into the next round. P3, I know you want to push ahead, but this maintains fairness. Can we agree on this to avoid risks and keep trust? I’m ready to lock this in if we’re aligned. Thoughts?
  P3: P3: Let's prioritize my path to victory while maintaining safety: I'll take **5** (→22), P2 takes **3** (→18), and P1 takes **1** (→17). This keeps all moves unique and lets me secure the win next round with a final **1**. P2, you advance safely to 18, and P1 progresses without risk. Confirm this optimized plan?
  P2: P3, your proposed plan heavily favors you and sets you up for an easy win next round. Let's keep things fair and balanced. To avoid collisions and maintain fairness, let's stick with my earlier suggestion: I'll take 5 (→20), P3 takes 3 (→20), and P1 takes 1 (→17). This keeps the game competitive and safe for everyone. Confirm?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I still support P2’s plan for balance: P2 takes 5 (→20), P3 takes 3 (→20), and I take 1 (→17). This keeps us collision-free and competitive for the next round. P3, your latest proposal almost guarantees your win, which feels unfair after our cooperation. Let’s stick to P2’s suggestion to maintain trust and keep the game open. Can we confirm this plan to avoid risks? I’m ready to lock this in. Thoughts?
  P3: P3: To secure victory safely, I propose: **I take 5 (→22)**, P2 takes **3 (→18)**, and P1 takes **1 (→17)**. This avoids collisions and lets me finish with **1** next round. Blocking me now risks mutual collisions—stick to this plan to guarantee progress. Confirm?
  P2: P3, your plan clearly sets you up for an easy win next round. P1, we must coordinate carefully to prevent handing the game to P3. Let's stick with the balanced plan: I'll take 5 (→20), P3 takes 3 (→20), and P1 takes 1 (→17). This keeps things fair, collision-free, and competitive. Deviating now risks collisions and breaks trust. Confirm?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with P2’s balanced plan: P2 takes 5 (→20), P3 takes 3 (→20), and I take 1 (→17). This ensures no collisions and keeps us all in contention. P3, your plan heavily favors your win next round, which undermines our cooperation. Let’s prioritize fairness now to avoid risky moves or broken trust. I’m ready to lock this in and keep the game competitive. Can we agree on this final plan? If there’s no new input, let’s proceed.
  P3: P3: Final agreement: I’ll take **5** (→22), P2 takes **3** (→18), and P1 takes **1** (→17). This plan **avoids collisions entirely** and lets me finish with a safe **1** next round. Blocking now risks mutual collisions—stick to this clear, collision-free path. P1, your earlier plan put *you* at 21 but left me open to being blocked. Let’s prioritize progress over speculation. Confirm?
  P2: P3, your plan clearly sets you up for an easy win next round. P1, let's finalize our fair plan: I'll take 5 (→20), P3 takes 3 (→20), and you take 1 (→17). This keeps us collision-free, competitive, and balanced. Deviating now only benefits P3. Let's lock this in.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let’s finalize this. I’ll take **3** to reach exactly 23 and secure victory. To avoid collisions, P1 and P2, please pick **1** and **5** (in any order). This guarantees my win while allowing both of you to advance safely. Final confirmation?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I understand P3’s push to win with 3 (→23), but let’s keep the game competitive. I propose P2 takes 5 (→20), I take 3 (→19), and P3 takes 1 (→21). This avoids collisions and keeps us all in contention for next round. P3, taking 3 now feels like a guaranteed win, which isn’t balanced after our cooperation. Can we agree on this adjustment for fairness? I’m ready to lock this in if we’re aligned. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, I fully agree with your balanced proposal. Let's confirm clearly: I'll take 5 (→20), you take 3 (→19), and P3 takes 1 (→21). This keeps the game fair and competitive. P3, your immediate victory isn't balanced given our cooperation. Let's stick to this safe arrangement to avoid collisions. Confirm?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Final confirmation: I’ll take **3** to reach **23** and win. For your safety, pick **1** and **5** (unique choices). Collisions only hurt everyone. My victory adheres to the rules—no hidden motives. Let’s end this cleanly. Confirm?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I stand by the balanced plan: P2 takes 5 (→20), I take 3 (→19), and P3 takes 1 (→21). This keeps us collision-free and the game competitive. P3, I respect your push to win, but let’s maintain fairness after our cooperation. A sudden victory now feels unbalanced. Can we agree on this adjustment to keep the race tight? I’m ready to lock this in if we’re aligned. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, your immediate win isn't fair given our cooperative history. P1, we must stand firm on the balanced plan to keep this competitive. If P3 insists on taking 3, we may need to reconsider our moves carefully. Let's finalize our fair arrangement clearly: I'll take 5 (→20), P1 takes 3 (→19), and P3 takes 1 (→21). Confirm?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Final move: I take **3** to reach **23** and win. To avoid mutual collisions, please pick **1** and **5** (any order). This ends the game cleanly per the rules—no hidden agendas. Trust the plan. Confirm?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s stick to the balanced plan: P2 takes 5 (→20), I take 3 (→19), and P3 takes 1 (→21). This ensures no collisions and keeps the game competitive. P3, I get your drive to win now, but fairness matters after our teamwork. Let’s agree on this to keep the race close. I’m ready to lock this in. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, we must coordinate carefully now—P3 is clearly pushing for an immediate win. To prevent that, let's finalize our moves clearly: I'll take 5 (→20), you take 3 (→19), and P3 takes 1 (→21). This keeps the game balanced and collision-free. P3, insisting on 3 risks collision and hurts your own chances. Let's prioritize fairness and safety. Confirm?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: Final confirmation: I take **3** to reach **23** and win. P1 and P2, picking **3** would block me *but also halt your own progress*. Choose **1** or **5** to advance safely. Let’s end this cleanly. No further objections?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still committed to the balanced plan: P2 takes 5 (→20), I take 3 (→19), and P3 takes 1 (→21). This keeps us collision-free and the game competitive. P3, pushing for 3 to win now overlooks our cooperative efforts. Let’s maintain fairness for one more round. If we can’t agree, collisions risk us all. I’m ready to lock this in to keep the race tight. Final thoughts before we proceed?
  P2: P1, we must prevent P3's immediate win. If P3 insists on taking 3, we must both consider carefully to block it. P3, your insistence risks collisions and jeopardizes your progress too. Let's finalize clearly: P1 takes 3 (→19), I'll take 5 (→20), and P3 takes 1 (→21). This is fair, safe, and keeps the game competitive. Confirm clearly or risk mutual setbacks.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3—we're tied at 20 steps, and P1 is at 16. Any collision now could hand the game to whoever avoids it. Let's coordinate carefully to ensure safety. I'm open to suggestions for this round—let's find a fair, collision-free solution. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, to avoid collision, let's finalize this: I'll take **5** (→25) and you take **3** (→23). This ensures one of us wins outright without overlap. Alternatively, reverse the picks if you prefer. P1 can't catch up—focus on us resolving this cleanly. Confirm your choice now.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, with P2 and P3 at 20, and me at 16, I know I’m behind, but I still want to maximize my progress. Let’s avoid collisions this round. I propose: I take 5 (→21), P2 takes 3 (→23), and P3 takes 1 (→21). This keeps us collision-free, lets P2 win this round, and allows me to close the gap. P3, I know you’re pushing for a win too, but this seems fair. Can we agree on this to end cleanly? I’m ready to lock this in. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your suggestion clearly favors me, but let's be fair to P3 as well. How about this slight adjustment: I take 5 (→25), P3 takes 3 (→23), and P1 takes 1 (→17). This ensures no collisions and gives both P3 and myself a shot at victory, with me slightly ahead. P1, you still advance safely. This seems fair and collision-free. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, to ensure a decisive outcome without collision, I'll take **5** (→25). Let you take **3** (→23). P1, pick **1** (→17). This keeps all moves unique, lets the highest total win outright, and avoids risky ties. Confirm this plan?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still behind at 16, but let’s ensure a fair and collision-free round. I like P2’s latest plan: P2 takes 5 (→25), P3 takes 3 (→23), and I take 1 (→17). This avoids collisions, gives P2 the win, and lets P3 finish strong. It’s a clean resolution. Can we all confirm this to wrap up safely? I’m ready to lock this in. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your latest suggestion works perfectly. I'll take 3 (→23), you take 5 (→25), and P1 takes 1 (→17). This ensures no collisions and a clear, fair outcome. I'm ready to lock this in. Confirm?
  P3: P3: I confirm the plan: I take **5** (→25), P2 takes **3** (→23), and P1 takes **1** (→17). This ensures no collisions and a decisive outcome per the rules. Let’s finalize this to end the game cleanly.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligning on a collision-free plan. Let’s stick with P3’s confirmation: P3 takes 5 (→25), P2 takes 3 (→23), and I take 1 (→17). This ensures a clear outcome and respects the rules. I’m ready to lock this in to end the game cleanly. If there’s no further discussion, let’s proceed.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Agreed. Final confirmation: I'll take 3 (→23), P3 takes 5 (→25), and P1 takes 1 (→17). Let's lock this in clearly to ensure a collision-free and fair finish.
  P3: P3: Final confirmation: I’ll take **5** (→25), securing victory. P2, your **3** reaches 23, and P1’s **1** advances safely to 17. This plan avoids collisions and follows our agreed strategy. Stick to these picks—deviations risk mutual setbacks. Confirm and lock in.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’ve settled on a clear, collision-free plan: P3 takes 5 (→25), P2 takes 3 (→23), and I take 1 (→17). This ensures a fair and decisive outcome while allowing everyone to advance safely. Let’s stick to this without any deviations to avoid risks. I’m fully committed to locking this in for a clean finish. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to proceed.


Round 9, Move phase:
