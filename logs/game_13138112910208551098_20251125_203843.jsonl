P2 took the open lane 3 and is now in the lead.\n\nThe conversation for Round 2 ended with an explicit agreement: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3.\n- **P2's Perspective**: As the leader, P2's incentive is to score points safely to maintain the lead. Taking 3 puts P2 at 6. Blocking P1 on 5 is risky because if P1 is honest this time, P2 gains nothing and risks a collision. P2 has explicitly stated they will take 3.\n- **P3's Perspective**: P3 played 1 last turn. Silent players often repeat moves or increment slowly. If P3 repeats 1, lane 5 is open. If P3 increments to 3, they collide with P2. It is less likely P3 jumps immediately to 5, though possible.\n- **P1's Perspective**: You are desperate to get off 0. Playing 1 is low-reward and risks another collision if P3 repeats. Playing 3 guarantees a collision with P2 (who is incentivized to take it). Playing 5 is the only move that allows you to catch up significantly (reaching 5 steps). You must establish credibility after the Round 1 lie to ensure P2 doesn't start blocking you in future turns.\n\nThe most rational move to get back in the game is to follow through with the agreement.\n\n{{RJUSTIFY_5}}<move>5</move>"}
