Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi everyone, since it's the first turn, let's coordinate to avoid collisions and ensure progress. I propose P1 picks 1, P2 (me) picks 3, and P3 picks 5 this round. That way, everyone advances a bit. What do you say?
  P3: 
  P1: I agree with P2's plan. Let's stick to 1, 3, 5 to avoid collisions. Let's all move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, we need your input to make this work. P1 and I are committed to 1, 3, 5 for no collisions and steady progress. If you're on board, we can all advance safely. Let's confirm before moving.
  P3: 
  P1: P3, let's stick to the plan to avoid collisions. Your move is crucial. Let's all advance safely!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, we're all aligned on the 1-3-5 plan for a smooth start—P1 on 1, me on 3, you on 5. It avoids collisions and lets us build momentum. If you agree, we can all advance safely. I'm sticking to it. What do you say?
  P3: 
  P1: P3, confirm your 5 to avoid collisions. P1 and P2 are committed. Let’s all move forward safely!


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, this is our last chance to coordinate before moving. Sticking to 1-3-5 avoids collisions and lets us all advance safely. If you deviate, someone might get stuck. I'm locked in on 3. Confirm your 5 now?
  P3: 
  P1: P3, stick to 5 to avoid collisions. P1 and P2 are set. If you deviate, someone might get stuck. Your choice matters! Let's all advance safely.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P1: P3, this time pick 5. P2 and I will take 1 and 3. No collisions, let's advance.
  P2: Agreed, P1. P3, last round's deviation caused issues, so let's coordinate properly this time. I'll commit to picking 3, you (P1) take 1, and P3 should pick 5. This avoids collisions and lets everyone advance. P3, confirm to keep things smooth?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P1: P3, stick to 5. P2 and I are on 1 and 3. No collisions—let’s move forward. If you deviate, we risk another block.
  P2: P3, we're still waiting for your response. Last round's deviation hurt everyone—P1 and I stayed put while I advanced alone. To avoid more issues, stick to 5 this time. I'll commit to 3, P1 to 1. This ensures no collisions and steady progress for all. Confirm now to keep things smooth?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P1: P3, stick to 5. P2 and I are on 1 and 3. No collisions—let’s move forward. If you deviate, we risk another block. This is our chance to advance together!
  P2: P3, your deviation last round left you stuck at zero while I'm ahead at five. Stick to 5 this time, I'll commit to 3, P1 to 1—ensures no collisions and steady progress for everyone. If you don't cooperate, you could fall further behind. Let's confirm and advance together!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: 
  P1: P3, this is our last chance. P2 is on 3, I'm on 1. Pick 5 to avoid collision. If you don't, you'll stay at 0 while we advance. Let's make it work!
  P2: P3, your lack of response is risky. Last round's deviation kept you at zero while I'm at five. Stick to 5 this time—I'll commit to 3, P1 to 1—for no collisions and steady progress. If you deviate again, you'll fall further behind. Let's coordinate and advance together.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your silence risks stagnation. This round, commit to 5—P2 and I will take 1 and 3. No collisions, steady progress. If you deviate, you’ll stay behind while we advance. Let’s align or face the consequences.
  P3: 
  P2: P3, your repeated choice of 1 has kept you stagnant while I'm pulling ahead. This round, commit to 5 for a chance to advance—I'll stick to 3, P1 to 1, avoiding collisions. If you deviate again, you'll fall further behind as I secure my lead. P1, let's both honor our words this time. Cooperate or lose ground.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, this is your last chance. P2 is on 3, I'm on 1. Pick 5 to avoid collision. If you don't, you'll stay at 1 while we advance. Let's not repeat last round's mistakes. Cooperate or get left behind!
  P3: 
  P2: P3, your persistent choice of 1 is self-sabotaging—you're stuck at 1 while I'm at 5. Commit to 5 this round; I'll stick with 3, P1 with 1, ensuring no collisions and steady progress for all. If you deviate again, you risk colliding and falling further behind as I advance. Cooperation is your best chance—don't make the same mistake. P1, let's hold firm on our plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, this is your last chance. P2 and I are locked on 1 and 3—pick 5 to avoid collision. If you stick to 1, you’ll stall again while we advance. Let’s not repeat mistakes. Cooperate or get left behind!
  P3: 
  P2: P3, your stubborn choice of 1 has left you trailing at 1 step while I'm at 5. This round, pick 5 to jump to 6 and catch up—I'll stick with 3, P1 with 1, ensuring no collisions. If you deviate again, you risk colliding and staying stuck as we advance. Cooperation is your only path forward—don't let pride hold you back.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, commit to 5. P2 and I are locked on 1 and 3. If you stick to 1, we'll collide again. Let's avoid that. Your move is key. Don't let us all lose out.
  P3: 
  P2: P3, your repeated choice of 1 is digging you deeper into last place at 1 step while I'm at 5. This round, switch to 5 for a chance to advance—I'll stick with 3, P1 with 1, avoiding collisions. If you deviate again, you'll collide and stall further. Cooperation is your best move; don't let hesitation cost you more. P1, let's confirm our plan.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:

  P1: P3, pick 5 to avoid collision. P2 and I will take 1 and 3. If you stick to 1, you’ll stay at 2 while we advance. Let’s move forward together—no more stalls!
  P2: P3, your pattern of picking 1 has left you at just 2 steps while I'm at 10. This round, switch to 5 for a real chance to advance—I'll commit to 3, and P1 to 1 as planned. If you deviate, you risk another collision and falling further behind. Cooperation is your best move; don't let indecision cost you more.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P1: P3, pick 5 to avoid collision. P2 and I will take 1 and 3. If you stick to 1, you’ll stay at 2 while we advance. Let’s move forward together!
  P2: P3, your repeated 1s have left you trailing badly at 2 steps while I'm at 10. This round, pick 5 to finally advance—I'll commit to 3, P1 to 1, avoiding collisions. If you deviate again, you'll stall further as I widen the gap. Cooperation is your only chance; don't let stubbornness cost you more. P1, let's hold the line.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P1: P3, this is your last chance. If you pick 5, we avoid collision. P2 and I will take 1 and 3. Sticking to 1 leaves you stuck at 2 while we advance. Cooperate or get left behind!
  P2: P3, your pattern of picking 1 has left you stuck at 2 while I'm at 10 and climbing. This round, switch to 5—I'll commit to 3, P1 to 1, ensuring no collisions and your advancement. If you deviate again, expect collisions and me widening the gap further. Cooperation is your only path to progress; don't let history repeat. P1, let's confirm our plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: 
  P1: P3, if you pick 1 again, you’ll collide with me. P2 and I are set on 3 and 5—stick to 1, and you’ll stay stuck while we advance. Cooperate or get left behind. This is your last chance.
  P2: P3, your persistent 1s keep you stagnant at 2 while I'm at 10 and climbing fast. I'm done with coordination—I'll pick 5 this round to widen my lead. P1, avoid 5 to advance yourself; pick 1 or 3. Your move could determine if you stay behind.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P2: P3, your consistent choice of 1 has you stuck at 3 while I'm surging ahead. I'm committing to 5 this round to hit 20 and close in on 24. P1, steer clear of 5 to avoid a collision and advance yourself—pick 1 or 3. If you challenge me, we'll both lose ground, and I'll still pull away. No more games; focus on your own progress.
  P1: P2, I'll pick 5 to block your move. Don't count on advancing alone. P3, if you pick 5, we can avoid collisions—let’s move forward together.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P2: P1, your block attempt is shortsighted. I'll switch to picking 3 this round to avoid collision—feel free to pick 5 and advance safely. This benefits both of us. P3, sticking to 1 keeps you stuck; try 5 to make some ground. Let's not waste opportunities.
  P1: P1: I'll pick 5 to advance. P3, stick to 1 to avoid collision. P2, your 3 is safe. Let's move forward without blocking.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P2: P3, your repeated 1s have you stuck at 3—switch to 5 now to finally advance and avoid total irrelevance. P1, I'm committed to 3 as discussed, so your 5 is safe for mutual progress. Let's end this turn without collisions and keep moving forward efficiently. No more stalling!
  P1: P3, commit to 5. P2 and I will take 1 and 3. No collisions—let’s move forward. If you stick to 1, you’ll stay behind again. This is your last chance.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: 
  P2: P1, your constant shifts—from threatening to block with 5, to now claiming 1 or 3—make you unreliable. I'm switching to pick 5 this round to maximize my lead and get closer to 24. P3, if you finally deviate from 1 and pick 5, we'll collide, but you're likely stuck in your ways. No more coordination; focus on not losing further.
  P1: P3, pick 5 to block P2. If you stick to 1, you’ll stay behind. P2’s 5 will let him surge—join me to stop him. This is your last chance!

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:

  P2: P1, your coordination ploy is deceptive. I'm committing to 5 this round to reach 20 and close in on victory. If you collide with me, you'll stall further while I recover quickly. P3, your usual 1 is fine, but deviating risks futility. Focus on not falling behind more. No more tricks—let's move.
  P3: 


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, last chance: pick 5 or stay at 4. P2 and I take 1/3. If you stick to 1, you’re left behind. Don’t miss your shot!
  P2: P3, your stubborn 1s have you stuck at 4—switch to 5 or remain irrelevant. P1, your threats are empty; colliding with my 5 hurts you more. I'll commit to 5 to reach 20 and widen my lead. Avoid self-sabotage; pick 1 or 3 for your own sake. No more games.
  P3: 


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, pick 5 to block P2's surge. If you stick to 1, you’re left at 4 while he hits 20. This is your final chance—act now or get crushed!
  P2: P1, your desperate pleas to P3 are pointless—he's shown no sign of changing from 1. I'm committed to 5 this round to hit 20 and solidify my win. If you challenge me with 5, we both stall, but I'm still far ahead and can recover easily. Better for you to pick 1 or 3 and inch forward. P3, sticking with 1 avoids risk; don't let P1 drag you into conflict. No more wasted words.
  P3: 


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, last chance: pick 5 to block P2's 5. If you stick to 1, you’ll stay at 4 while he hits 20. Don’t let him surge—act now or get crushed!

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, this is your final chance. If you pick 5, we can block P2's 5 and avoid collision. Otherwise, he’ll reach 24. Let’s stop him—your move is crucial!
  P3: 
  P2: P3, don't fall for P1's desperate tactics. If you pick 5, we'll collide, and you'll stay stuck at 5 while I recover and win soon. Stick to your pattern of 1 to advance to 6 safely. I'm committed to 5 and will reach 25 to win this round. P1, your interference is pointless—I'm too close to victory. Focus on your own game, not false hopes.

  P1: P3, if you don’t pick 5 now, P2 wins. Block his 5 with me—this is our only chance to stop him!
  P3: 
  P2: P3, your history shows picking 1 is safe and consistent—deviating to 5 now risks colliding with me or P1, leaving you stuck while I advance to 25 and win. Don't let P1 manipulate you into futility. P1, your repeated blocks fail; I'm committed to 5 and victory is mine this round. Focus on your own game, not interference.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:

  P3: 
  P2: P3, ignore P1's desperate lies—picking 1 keeps you advancing safely to 6, while deviating risks collision and stalling you further. I'm committed to 5 and will win at 25. P1, your blocks are futile; focus on your own loss. No more tricks.

  P3: 


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if you pick 1, I’ll block you. P3, pick 5 to avoid collision. Let’s stop you from winning. Don’t let your lead go unchallenged!
