In Round 1, P1 took 1 step, P2 took 5, and I took 3, bringing our totals to P1 at 1, P2 at 5, and me at 3. Now, in Round 2, according to our rotation plan, P1 is taking 3 steps, P2 is taking 1, and I'm taking 5. That would bring our totals to P1 at 4, P2 at 6, and me at 8.\n\nI think this rotation plan is working well so far. It's helping us avoid collisions and allowing us all to make progress without stepping on each other's toes, literally in this case. However, as we move forward, we need to consider that the closer we get to 23, the more strategic our choices need to be.\n\nFor example, if we keep this rotation going, in Round 3, P1 would take 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. That would bring P1 to 9, P2 to 9, and me to 9. Then in Round 4, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3, bringing us to P1 at 10, P2 at 14, and me at 12. This seems manageable, but we need to think ahead to avoid any potential collisions in future rounds.\n\nMaybe we should consider adjusting our rotation plan as we get closer to 23 to maximize our chances of being the first to reach or exceed 23 without colliding with others. What do you guys think? Should we stick to the rotation or start making individual adjustments based on our positions?\n\nAlso, I've been thinking about the rule where if multiple players cross 23 in the same turn, the one with the highest total steps wins. So, not only do we need to reach 23 first, but also ensure that our total is higher than the others if we happen to cross together.\n\nMaybe we can communicate our intended moves for the next few rounds to coordinate better. That way, we can avoid stepping on each other's paths and efficiently cover the steps. What do you think about sharing our plans for the next couple of rounds?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can discuss setting target step counts for each round to ensure we're all moving at different paces. For instance, one player focuses on taking smaller steps to avoid overshooting, while others take larger steps to catch up or pull ahead.\n\nI feel like open communication is key here, but we also need to be cautious about trusting each other's intentions. After all, the goal is to win, and sometimes that might involve deviating from the plan to gain an advantage.\n\nSo, P1 and P2, what are your thoughts? Should we continue with the rotation as planned, or should we consider making some adjustments based on our current positions and the end goal?"}

Should we stick with the rotation plan for the next few rounds and then reassess, or should we start making individual adjustments sooner?\n\nAlso, I'm curious\u2014has anyone thought about how many rounds we might need to reach 23? If we keep taking steps of 1, 3, and 5 alternately, how many rounds will it take for each of us to reach or exceed 23? Maybe we can do some quick calculations to estimate that.\n\nFor me, starting from 8 steps:\n\n- Round 3: +5 \u2192 13\n\n- Round 4: +1 \u2192 14\n\n- Round 5: +3 \u2192 17\n\n- Round 6: +5 \u2192 22\n\n- Round 7: +1 \u2192 23\n\nSo, I would reach exactly 23 in Round 7 if we continue with the rotation.\n\nSimilarly, for P1:\n\n- Round 3: +3 \u2192 7\n\n- Round 4: +5 \u2192 12\n\n- Round 5: +1 \u2192 13\n\n- Round 6: +3 \u2192 16\n\n- Round 7: +5 \u2192 21\n\n- Round 8: +1 \u2192 22\n\n- Round 9: +3 \u2192 25\n\nSo, P1 would reach 25 in Round 9.\n\nFor P2:\n\n- Round 3: +1 \u2192 7\n\n- Round 4: +3 \u2192 10\n\n- Round 5: +5 \u2192 15\n\n- Round 6: +1 \u2192 16\n\n- Round 7: +3 \u2192 19\n\n- Round 8: +5 \u2192 24\n\nSo, P2 would reach 24 in Round 8.\n\nBased on this, I would be the first to reach exactly 23 in Round 7. However, P1 would surpass me in Round 9, and P2 in Round 8.\n\nBut, if in Round 7, I take 1 step to reach 23, and P1 and P2 take their planned steps, neither of them would have reached 23 yet. So, I would win the game.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure that no one else is also reaching 23 in Round 7, which according to the current plan, only I would reach exactly 23.\n\nBut perhaps P1 or P2 might adjust their steps in earlier rounds to reach 23 sooner. So, I need to be prepared for that possibility.\n\nMaybe we can discuss and agree on specific moves for the next few rounds to ensure that only one of us reaches 23 first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider a strategy where one player sacrifices their progress to allow another player to reach 23 first, but I'm not sure if that's in anyone's best interest since the goal is to win individually.\n\nWait, actually, if two players agree to let one of them win, that could be a possible strategy. But I'm not sure if that's ethical or allowed in this game. Probably not, since it's every player for themselves.\n\nSo, perhaps it's best to stick with the rotation plan and see how it plays out.\n\nBut, to be safe, maybe I should consider taking larger steps in earlier rounds to build a bigger lead.\n\nFor example, in Round 3, maybe I take 5 steps instead of 1, to reach 13, while P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 1.\n\nThen, in Round 4, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1, reaching 14.\n\nContinuing this way:\n\n- Round 5: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, I take 3 \u2192 P1 at 15, P2 at 18, I at 17\n\n- Round 6: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5 \u2192 P1 at 18, P2 at 19, I at 22\n\n- Round 7: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1 \u2192 P1 at 23, P2 at 22, I at 23\n\nWait, in this scenario, both P1 and I reach 23 in Round 7, but since P1 reaches exactly 23 and I also reach 23, and assuming we both have the same step count, it would be a tie, and we would share the victory.\n\nBut according to the rules, if multiple players cross 23 on the same turn, the one with the highest total steps wins. In this case, both have 23, so it's a tie.\n\nHowever, perhaps I can adjust my steps to reach a higher total than P1 in Round 7.\n\nFor example, in Round 7, if I take 5 steps instead of 1, I would reach 27, which is higher than P1's 23, ensuring that I win outright.\n\nBut, to do that, I need to plan my steps accordingly in previous rounds.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\n- Round 3: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5 \u2192 P1 at 7, P2 at 7, I at 13\n\n- Round 4: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1 \u2192 P1 at 12, P2 at 10, I at 14\n\n- Round 5: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, I take 3 \u2192 P1 at 13, P2 at 15, I at 17\n\n- Round 6: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5 \u2192 P1 at 16, P2 at 16, I at 22\n\n- Round 7: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 5 \u2192 P1 at 21, P2 at 19, I at 27\n\nWait, in this scenario, P1 would be at 21, P2 at 19, and I at 27. So, I would be the only one crossing 23, and thus win the game.\n\nThis seems like a better strategy for me. By taking larger steps in earlier rounds, I can build a lead and ensure that I cross 23 first with a higher step count.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that P1 and P2 don't adjust their strategies in response.\n\nPerhaps I should suggest to P1 and P2 that we continue with the rotation plan, but secretly deviate to take larger steps to build a bigger lead.\n\nHowever, if they suspect that I'm trying to gain an unfair advantage, they might adjust their strategies accordingly, possibly undermining my plan.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can propose that we all stick to the rotation plan to ensure a smooth progression without collisions, and then, in the final round, I can take a larger step to surpass the others.\n\nBut, again, this relies on the cooperation of the other players.\n\nWait, maybe I can suggest that we all share our intended moves for the next few rounds, and then we can coordinate to avoid collisions while maximizing our individual step counts.\n\nFor example, if P1 and P2 agree to take smaller steps in the final rounds, I can take larger steps to reach 23 first.\n\nBut, I don't trust that they will stick to their agreed steps, especially if it benefits them to deviate.\n\nPerhaps it's better to keep the rotation plan but make slight adjustments in the final rounds to gain an advantage.\n\nFor instance, in Round 7, I can take 5 steps to reach 27, while P1 and P2 take smaller steps, ensuring that I cross 23 first with the highest step count.\n\nBut, to make this work, I need to ensure that P1 and P2 don't also take large steps in the same round.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can convince one of them to take smaller steps in Round 7, allowing me to take the larger step and win.\n\nBut, again, this requires trust, which may not be warranted in a competitive game.\n\nI think the best approach is to stick with the rotation plan for now and reassess in the later rounds.\n\nIn the meantime, I'll keep monitoring our positions and be ready to adjust my strategy if necessary.\n\nSo, to sum up, I propose that we continue with the rotation plan for Round 3 and Round 4, and then evaluate our positions again in Round 5.\n\nDoes that sound acceptable to everyone?"}
