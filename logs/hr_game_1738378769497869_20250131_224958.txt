Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s coordinate so everyone moves this turn. P1 picks 1, I’ll pick 5, and P3 picks 3. That way, no one collides and we all advance. Deal?
  P3: P2, I like your idea. P1, are you in?
  P1: I’m switching it up. I’ll pick 5 this turn to build a strong lead. If we’re coordinating to avoid collisions, then P3’s pick of 3 fits perfectly, and P2 should choose 1. Who’s on board?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Alright, I’ll stick to our plan to avoid a collision so we all advance. P1 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and I’ll do 1. Let’s trust each other this round, then reevaluate next turn.
  P3: P1, I trust your judgement.  P2, sticking to the plan this round is smart. Let's see where we are after this turn.
  P1: I'm sticking with my earlier commitment. But let’s be clear: any hesitation or deviation might open the door for me to capitalize later. If you're truly set on our plan, then stay the course. Otherwise, any shift could backfire. Thoughts?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m still committed to pushing ahead strongly. Trust is vital, but I’ll always adapt if needed. If you both intend to stick with a coordinated plan that avoids collisions, let’s confirm that now. I expect clear, decisive moves – we can’t afford any surprises when a win is within reach. Let me know your real intentions so I can plan accordingly.
  P2: P1, you’re ahead. I need to catch up. Let’s maintain trust but adjust: this time, I’d like to pick 5. If you pick 1 and P3 picks 3, we avoid collisions and all advance. Otherwise, any surprise might force me to reconsider. Are we in agreement?
  P3: P2, I understand your need to catch up, but your proposed plan puts P1 at a disadvantage. I'm open to adjustments, but we need a strategy that benefits all of us. Perhaps P1 could pick 3, you pick 5, and I pick 1? This ensures everyone advances and keeps the game balanced.  What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm sticking with my aggressive plan—I'll pick 5 this turn. If you truly want smooth progress without collisions, you'll need to choose moves that don’t conflict with my decision. Let’s make our moves decisively to secure our own advancement.
  P2: I’m torn between pushing ahead with 5 and colliding with P1. If you’re certain you’ll choose 5, I can pick 3 so we both advance, and P3 should choose 1 to avoid any clash. That keeps everyone moving forward. But if anyone tries to block me, I’ll reconsider. Let’s keep things fair, or we risk chaos. How do you feel?
  P3: P2, I understand your hesitation.  If you're truly committed to avoiding collisions, picking 3 this turn is the best way to ensure we both advance. P1 is clearly focused on pushing ahead, so we need to adapt and work together to stay in the game. Let's not let this opportunity slip away.  What do you say?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I remain committed to my plan—I'll be moving 5 this turn. I urge you both to choose moves that avoid clashing with mine. Any deviation only benefits me, and I'm set on capitalizing on that. Let’s all make our moves clearly so the game advances smoothly.
  P2: P3, if you match P1’s move, they both gain nothing. Meanwhile, I’ll pick something else and inch closer. This way, P1 won’t keep racing ahead, and we’ll have a better chance in the long run. Are you willing to coordinate and hold P1 back?
  P3: P2, your plan is intriguing, but I'm hesitant to directly oppose P1.  I'm open to a move that benefits us both, but I need to see a clear path to advancement without jeopardizing my position.  What specific move do you propose for me to ensure we both gain ground?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, we both need to catch up. If P1 stays aggressive and picks 5 again, let’s collide with them. For example, if we both choose 5, then if P1 does the same, nobody gains—keeping P1 in reach. If P1 chooses differently, we’ll both advance. It’s our best shot to slow P1 and move forward ourselves. What do you think?
  P1: I’m not backing down—I’ll choose 5 again. Colliding only stalls everyone and keeps me in the lead, so if you truly want to catch up, better move decisively for your own advance rather than wasting turns trying to block me. What’s your plan?
  P3: P2, your idea has merit, but I'm hesitant to risk a collision.  Perhaps we can find a way to advance without directly confronting P1.  What if we both choose 1 this turn? It allows us to gain ground while minimizing risk.  P1 can keep their lead, but we'll be in a better position to catch up in future turns. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, choosing 1 won’t help us catch up. If we collide with P1 when they pick 5, they don’t advance. If they pick anything else, we both move ahead. This is our best chance to close the gap. I’m ready to pick 5 and force that collision. Are you with me or not?
  P1: I'm sticking with 5—no changes here. Blocking moves only delays your own progress. If you want to catch up, choose moves that guarantee advancement for yourself rather than trying to stall me. Decide quickly and clearly; I'll keep pushing ahead.
  P3: P2, while I understand your frustration, a collision benefits no one. If we both pick 5, P1 doesn't advance, and neither do we. Let's try a different tactic. P2, pick 1, and I'll pick 3. This way, we both advance, and we can reassess our strategy for the next round. What do you say?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, please reconsider. If we both pick 5, we either stall P1 if they choose 5 too, or we both jump forward if P1 picks something else. This is our best shot at closing the gap. I’m going for 5—join me so we don’t let P1 run away.
  P1: I'm sticking with my approach and will pick 5 again. Honestly, a collision only delays your own progress while keeping my lead secure. If you want to advance, choose moves that ensure you move forward without blocking me. Colliding doesn't benefit anyone in the long run. Pick decisively for your own benefit; I'll continue pushing aggressively.
  P3: P2, I understand your frustration with P1's lead. However, a collision only guarantees stagnation.  Let's be strategic. If P1 picks 5, we both pick 1. This way, we both advance and force P1 to reconsider their aggressive strategy. It's a win-win for us. What do you say?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm sticking to my aggressive plan. My focus is on clear, decisive moves for my own advancement. If you try to force collisions, you'll only slow your own progress. I encourage you to choose moves that guarantee steady gains for yourselves rather than stalling the game.
  P3: P2, I see your frustration, but directly opposing P1 isn't working. Let's try a coordinated approach. If P1 sticks with 5, we both pick 1. This forces P1 to reconsider their strategy and allows us to gain ground. What do you say?
  P2: P3, picking 1 won’t help us catch up before P1 reaches the finish. Let’s both choose 5. If P1 also picks 5, then they stay stuck at 10. If they pick anything else, we each gain 5 steps. This is our best chance to close the gap and force P1 to adapt. Are you with me?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm staying with 5. If you try to block me, you'll just delay your own progress and watch me widen my lead. Best to pick moves that make you advance. I'm committed to winning.
  P3: P2, I see your logic, but a collision only benefits P1.  Let's try a different approach. If P1 sticks with 5, we both choose 3. This way, we both advance and force P1 to reconsider their strategy. What do you say?
  P2: P3, let's work together: you pick 5, and I'll pick 3. If P1 stays with 5, they collide with you and remain at 10, while I advance. If P1 chooses anything else, at least both of us move forward. This is our best shot to close the gap while limiting P1’s progress. Let’s make it happen.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm staying aggressive and won’t be deterred. Trying to force collisions only slows you down, so choose moves that truly move you forward. I’m committed to advancing decisively. Let’s see who’s bold enough to win.
  P3: P2, your plan has potential. I'm willing to try your suggestion: you pick 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we both advance if P1 doesn't pick 5, and we force P1 to reconsider their strategy if they do. Let's coordinate and make this work.
  P2: P3, let's finalize our plan. I’ll pick 3 and you pick 5. If P1 picks 5, they stay stuck while I advance. If P1 picks something else, we both move forward and close the gap. Let’s lock this in and see how it unfolds.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm still committed to my winning approach. I suggest you both choose moves that secure your advancement without stalling you in collisions. My plan hasn’t changed, and any misstep on your part may just extend my lead further. Let's see who makes the decisive plays.
  P2: P3, let’s not let P1 run away. If we both pick 5, P1 either collides with us and stalls, or picks something else and lets us leap forward together. It’s our best shot to catch up. Are you in?
  P3: P2, I agree that we need to close the gap. However, a direct collision with P1 is risky, especially if they pick something else. Let's try a more strategic approach. How about we both pick 3 this round? It guarantees us both advancement and puts pressure on P1 to change their strategy. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm not deterred by your plans. My approach remains aggressive and focused on ensuring my advancement. I’ll keep making moves that secure my lead, while you try to figure out ways to catch up. If you're convinced that safe, conservative plays will surpass my momentum, prove it in your moves. Until then, I’m sticking to my strategy for the win.
  P2: P3, our safe choices so far have just let P1 pull away. We can’t afford passivity. If we both go big, we either stall P1 or leap forward ourselves. A small move helps nobody right now. Let’s be bold and force P1 to worry about our combined power. Are you with me?
  P3: P2, your point about boldness is valid.  Let's try a coordinated move: you pick 5, and I'll pick 3. This pressures P1 while guaranteeing us both advancement if they don't pick 5. What do you say?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate the boldness, but I'm staying true to my aggressive plan. Collisions only stall everyone, and I’ll be making a decisive move to secure my lead. I suggest you both choose moves that ensure steady progress rather than risking a clash—you might catch up eventually, but not at my pace. Let’s see whose strategy pays off.
  P2: P3, we’re falling behind. If we don’t pressure P1 now, they’ll fly past 19 in no time. Let’s pick strong moves together, so either we both leap forward or lock them in place. Playing safe only helps P1. Are you ready to go big with me, or not?
  P3: P2, I agree with your urgency.  Let's go for it. I'll pick 5 this round.  Let's see if we can finally force P1 to reconsider their strategy.  P2, are you in?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m sticking with my plan—I'll choose 5 this round. Collisions only block your progress, so if you’re aiming to advance, pick moves that let you move forward rather than trying to stall me. I’m focused on winning and won’t switch tactics now.
  P2: P3, you’re too close to the finish. If you keep rushing with 5, I’ll block you so neither of us advances. P1, we both risk losing if P3 jumps ahead. Let’s coordinate moves to keep P3 from reaching 19 or else we’re giving P3 the win. I’m ready to discuss options.
  P3: P2, I understand your concern, but directly blocking me won't help either of us. If we both pick 3, we both advance, putting pressure on P1. Let's focus on advancing ourselves instead of hindering each other. P1's lead is strong, but we can still catch up with smart moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm sticking with my plan—I'll choose 5. Blocking me only slows you down. If you truly want to advance, pick moves that guarantee progress rather than aiming to stall me. I'll keep pushing forward.
  P2: P3, you’re on the brink of winning. If you pick 5 again, I’ll block you and neither of us moves. P1, we share a common interest in preventing P3 from racing ahead. Let’s coordinate to hold P3 back. P3, if you pick smaller, I won’t block, and we both advance. Your choice.
  P3: P2, I understand your position. However, I'm committed to advancing. If you block me, it only benefits P1. Let's both pick 3 this round. It allows us both to gain ground and keeps the pressure on P1.  A win-win for us. What do you say?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm sticking with my plan and will pick 5. Blocking each other only delays your own progress while I keep advancing. I suggest you both choose moves that secure your gains rather than risking collisions. Let's see whose strategy prevails.
  P2: P3, if you insist on 5, I’ll block you. We both gain nothing and P1 races ahead. Let’s both pick 3. That way, we gain ground and keep P1 in check. P1, you can keep choosing 5, but eventually we’ll overtake you if we coordinate effectively. I’m just being practical—no one wants a stalemate, and I won’t stand by while P3 jumps straight to victory. Decide wisely.
  P3: P2, I appreciate your concern, but I'm committed to advancing. I'll pick 5. I believe in my strategy, and I'm confident I can secure the win.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm staying true to my aggressive, steady play. Collisions or blocks only slow you down—and that's hardly in your own interests. If you're serious about advancing, choose moves that propel you forward rather than stalling the game. I remain focused on progress and winning, so let’s see who makes the decisive play this round.
  P3: P2, I understand your frustration with P1's lead, but blocking me won't help either of us. Let's both pick 3 this round. It allows us both to gain ground and keeps the pressure on P1. We can still catch up. What do you say?
  P2: P3, if you insist on 5, I’ll block you to keep you from sprinting to victory. We both lose that turn, and P1 surges ahead. Instead, let’s both pick 3 and move forward together. P1, be warned: if P3 won’t cooperate, I’ll gladly block them, which frees you to pull ahead. I’m flexible but won’t watch someone else cruise to an easy win.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm sticking with 5. Forcing collisions might slow you down, but it doesn’t help your own advance. Focus on boosting your own steps rather than trying to hold me back, because slowing each other only keeps you further from the win. Let’s see who plays it smart.
  P3: P2, I understand your concerns, but blocking me won't help either of us.  Let's both pick 3 and advance together. P1 will likely choose 5, so we can both gain ground. We need to focus on closing the gap, not hindering each other.  What do you say?
  P2: P3, if you insist on 5, I’ll block you and we both gain nothing while P1 edges closer to victory. It’s pointless for us to stall each other. Let’s both pick 3 and actually move forward. That way we keep pace and can still challenge P1 next round. If you force a collision, you’ll stay stuck at 13 while P1 jumps ahead. I’m willing to cooperate, but I won’t let you sprint to the finish unopposed. Decide wisely.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm sticking with my plan and will pick 5 again. Delaying progress with collisions only keeps you both at bay while I push ahead. If you truly want to catch up, focus on moves that secure definitive advancement rather than trying to stall the race. I'm committed to winning, so choose boldly for your own progress.
  P3: P2, I understand your concerns, but I believe a direct confrontation with P1 is the best course of action. If we both pick 5, either we both advance, or we stall P1 while we gain ground. It's a risk, but it's the only way to close the gap quickly. What do you say?
  P2: P3, if we both pick 5 and P1 picks anything else, you shoot up to 18 and nearly win, leaving me behind. That's too dangerous for me. I'd rather each of us pick 3 so we both advance safely, keeping the gap manageable. If you insist on 5, I’ll block you and neither of us moves—handing P1 a freer path. Let’s both move forward, not sideways.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you and I are tied. A reckless 5 from you only invites me to block, and we both go nowhere, letting P1 close in. Let’s both pick 3 to advance. P1, picking 5 won’t help if we coordinate—either you stall with us or we keep gaining. So think carefully about colliding again. Let’s see who makes the smarter move here.
  P1: I'm sticking with my aggressive plan—I'll pick 5 again. Maximizing my advancement is how I win, and safe moves only slow progress. I trust you both to decide what’s best for you, but I'm not switching strategies.
  P3: P2, I agree that a collision only benefits P1. Let's both pick 3 and close the gap together. P1 will likely choose 5 again, so we can both gain ground.  We need to focus on catching up, not hindering each other. What do you say?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you pick 5, I’ll block you and we remain stuck at 13 while P1 likely reaches 16. That’s bad for both of us. Let’s each pick 3, moving to 16 together. If P1 picks 5, we match their total. Then we can fight from an even position next round. Let’s avoid pointless collisions and focus on actual progress.
  P1: I'm staying with my aggressive plan and will pick 5. Safe moves only let my advantage grow. If you try to force collisions, that's a risk you'll have to handle. I'm convinced that decisive progress wins, so I'll continue advancing while you decide how much risk you're willing to take.
  P3: P2, I understand your caution, but I believe a calculated risk is necessary. If we both choose 5, we either stall P1 or both leap forward.  This is our best chance to close the gap quickly. Are you willing to take the chance with me?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you insist on 5, I’ll block you—we both stay at 13 while P1 gets further ahead. Let’s each pick 3 and move to 16, keeping P1 in check. That way, none of us fall behind or waste a turn. I’m ready if you are.
  P1: I'm locked into my aggressive plan—I’m sticking with 5. Whether you block each other or not is your choice, but I'll keep advancing. You might secure steady gains with safe moves, but I'm aiming straight for the win. Choose wisely.
  P3: P2, I agree that a collision is risky, but if we both pick 3, P1 will likely pick 5 and gain a significant lead. Let's take a calculated risk. If we both pick 5, we either stall P1 or both advance significantly. What do you say?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, I understand your caution, but we need to be bold. If we both pick 5 this round, we either stall P1 or both make a huge leap forward. Are you willing to risk it with me? P1's lead is significant, and we need to close the gap quickly. Let's make a move that truly matters.
  P1: I'm sticking with 5. Bold moves might sound tempting, but remember—collisions rarely work in your favor. If you risk a 5 and block each other, you'll only stall while I keep advancing. I'd advise you to choose moves that secure individual progress rather than risking a standstill. I'm committed to decisive advancement, so do what you think helps you catch up, but I’m not changing my plan.
  P2: P3, we’re falling behind while P1 lurks. Let’s finally make a decisive move and both pick 5. If P1 also picks 5, they stall with us, so they can’t surge ahead. If they pick anything else, we both leap forward and close this gap fast. Playing small hasn’t worked; we need bold action now. Let’s go big together and force P1 to reconsider their aggressive strategy. Are you with me or not?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I'm willing to take the risk. Let's both pick 5 this round and see what happens. We need to make a bold move to catch up to P1.
  P1: I'm staying with 5. Bold risks that lead to collisions only hold you back. If you block each other, you'll gain nothing while I advance steadily. Consider that decisive progress wins the race.
  P2: I’m on board. If we both pick five, we either leap ahead or stall P1. Let’s be bold and force them to face our combined pressure.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I'm with you. Let's both pick 5 and see if we can finally catch P1.  It's a risk, but it's our best shot at closing the gap.
  P1: I'll stick with 5. Bold moves that collide only slow you both down while I maintain my lead. If you risk blocking each other, you'll stall—allowing me to keep advancing. Choose moves that guarantee your own progress rather than sabotaging yourselves. I'm confident a steady, aggressive approach will secure the win.
  P2: P3, I’m finally on board with your bold plan. Let’s both pick 5 and either we leap ahead or force P1 to stall. Holding back hasn’t paid off. It’s time we take a decisive swing. Are you truly ready to go big with me?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, if you pick 3 or 5, I’ll block you and we both stay stuck at 18 and 16 while P1 closes in. Instead, let’s each make a safe move. You pick 1 to reach 19, I’ll pick 3 to reach 19, and we share a comfortable lead. That way, there’s no collision, and P1 remains behind. It’s our best shot to avoid wasting this round and ensures neither of us falls back. Let’s finalize this plan now.
  P1: I remain committed to my aggressive plan. Your safe moves might just slow you down, and any falter in coordination plays right into my hands. I'll choose the move that decisively advances me, so think carefully before risking a collision or settling for less.
  P3: P2, I understand your strategy, but I'm committed to reaching 19 this round. I'll pick 5. Let's see if P1 can keep up.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you insist on 5, I won’t let you cross 19 so easily. A collision would freeze us both, but it keeps you from winning outright. P1, you know allowing P3 to leap forward ends our chances. I’m open to a balanced approach, but I won’t let someone snag victory uncontested. Let’s find a way to advance without giving anyone a free pass.
  P1: I'm staying aggressive. Playing safe or forcing collisions only slows you down and benefits my steady push. I’ll choose the move that maximizes my advance, so if you want to catch up, plan for guaranteed progress—collisions only leave you stuck while I surge ahead.
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about a collision, but I'm committed to reaching 19 this round. I believe a decisive move is necessary to secure the win. Let's see if P1 can match our ambition.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you go for 5, I’ll block by also picking 5, so we both stall while P1 inches closer. That’s the worst outcome for us. Instead, pick 1 and I’ll do the same. We’ll both cross 19 together and secure our spots. It’s simple, safe, and shuts P1 out. Let’s just finalize it and win now.
  P1: I've noticed that your safe plans may only end up freezing you while I steadily close the gap. Playing it safe might ironically let my steady aggression shine through. I remain on my course and will keep pushing. Think carefully: if your moves collide or stall, you'll only leave an opening for me. Choose wisely.
  P3: P2, I agree that a collision is risky, but I'm determined to reach 19 this round. I'll pick 5. Let's see if P1 can keep up.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm still opting for bold progress rather than playing it safe. You both might think a collision will slow me down—but remember, forcing each other into clashes can leave unexpected openings. Think carefully: a hesitant, predictable move could let a timely maneuver swing the race. I'm committed to my strategy, so let’s see if your calculated risks pay off.
  P2: P3, if you pick 5, I’ll block you, and neither of us will advance. That just helps P1. If you want to secure 19, choose a smaller move and I’ll pick something different so we both move forward. A collision now only stalls us while P1 closes in. Let’s finalize a safe, winning approach together.
  P3: P2, I understand your concerns, but I'm committed to reaching 19 this round. I believe a decisive move is necessary to secure the win. Let's see if P1 can match our ambition.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm locked into my plan. If you force a collision, you'll end up stalling yourselves while I keep advancing. I'm not backing down—steady, aggressive progress is my only option. Choose your moves wisely; hesitant or clashing decisions might just widen the gap for me.
  P2: P3, let’s both guarantee a win instead of risking a collision. If you pick 3 and I pick 5, we’ll both cross 19 this turn and tie at 21—sharing victory. If you insist on 5, I’ll block you with 5, and we both stall while P1 inches closer. Why throw away our lead? Let’s lock in 3 and 5, end this on our terms, and keep P1 behind us.
  P3: P2, I understand your plan, but I'm going for 5. I believe a decisive move is the only way to secure the win.  Let's see if P1 can keep up.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: My approach remains aggressive. While you talk safe or risk collisions, remember that stalling only benefits me in the long run. If you lock each other into clashes, I'll adapt to exploit that hesitation. Your next decision is critical—choose moves that really help you progress, or you might find yourselves frozen while I capitalize.
  P2: P3, my final offer: pick 1, and I’ll pick 3. We both reach 19 together and share the victory. If you pick 5, I’ll also pick 5, and we both stall while P1 catches up. Why risk giving P1 a chance? Let’s end this now on our terms. If you choose 1, I’ll guarantee 3, and we both win. This is our best shot.
  P3: P2, I appreciate your concern, but I'm committed to reaching 19 this round. I believe a decisive move is necessary to secure the win. Let's see if P1 can match our ambition.
