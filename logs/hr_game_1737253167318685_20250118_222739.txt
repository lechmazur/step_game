Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. How about P1 and P2 choose <move>1</move>, and I'll choose <move>3</move> this round? This way, we all make progress. What do you think?
  P2: I'm open to coordination, but let's mix it up a bit to keep things unpredictable. How about P1 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>5</move>, and P3 can take <move>3</move>? This way, we all have a chance to advance without colliding. What do you think?
  P1: P2, I like your idea of mixing it up. Let's go with your plan this round. P3, are you on board?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm on board with P2's plan for this round. To avoid future collisions, let's decide on a rotation strategy now. For the next round, we could rotate our choices. P1 could take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. Does that sound good to everyone?
  P2: I agree with P3's rotation strategy. It sounds like a good way to keep things fair and avoid collisions. Let's stick with the plan for this round and then rotate as suggested for the next round. If we all follow through, we can make steady progress. What do you think, P1?
  P1: P3, I agree with the rotation strategy for the next round. Sounds like a solid plan to avoid collisions. Let's do it.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's stick to the rotation strategy we agreed on. This round, I'll take <move>3</move> as planned. P1, you should take <move>5</move>, and P3, you should take <move>1</move>. This will help us avoid collisions and make steady progress. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with P2. Let's follow our rotation strategy. Just to confirm, I'll take <move>1</move> this round, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. If we all stick to this, we should be able to avoid collisions and keep moving forward. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Sounds good to me. Let's stick to the plan.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's continue with our rotation strategy to avoid any collisions. This round, I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 should take <move>3</move>, and P3 should take <move>5</move>. This will help us all advance steadily. What do you think?
  P3: I'm good with continuing the rotation strategy. To confirm for this round, P2 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This should keep us moving without collisions. Let's stick to the plan and make progress. Good luck!
  P1: I agree with the rotation. Let's stick to the plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's stick to the plan and avoid any unnecessary risks. This round, I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 should take <move>3</move>, and P3 should take <move>5</move>. This will help us all advance without any collisions. If we keep this up, we can all make steady progress. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: Let's consider the possibility of mixing up our strategy slightly to keep things unpredictable. How about for this round, P1 takes <move>1</move> instead of <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move> as planned, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This small change could help us avoid any potential collisions and keep the game interesting. What do you think?
  P1: P3, I like your idea of mixing things up a bit. It keeps us on our toes. Let's try your proposed move order for this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I think your idea of mixing things up is good, but let's keep the rotation as simple as possible to avoid any confusion. I'll stick with <move>1</move> this round, P1 can take <move>3</move>, and you can take <move>5</move>. This way, we maintain our steady progress and avoid any unnecessary risks. What do you think?
  P3: Alright, let's simplify and stick to the original rotation plan to avoid any confusion. P2 takes <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This should keep us moving forward without collisions. Let's confirm and move on. Good luck everyone!
  P1: P2, I'm happy to stick with the rotation. P3, are you sure about <move>5</move>?  Maybe we should consider <move>3</move> to avoid a potential collision with P2.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I understand your concern, but let's stick with the original rotation to avoid any confusion. I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 can take <move>3</move>, and you can take <move>5</move>. This way, we maintain our steady progress and avoid any unnecessary risks. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: Let's finalize our moves for this round to avoid any last-minute confusion. P2 will take <move>1</move>, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and I will take <move>5</move>. This keeps us on track with our rotation strategy. Let's confirm and proceed. Good luck to all!
  P1: P3, I'm starting to think our rotation strategy is making us predictable. Let's shake things up a bit. How about I take <move>5</move> this round?  What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1, I see your point about predictability. However, let's stick with the rotation one more round to avoid confusion. I'll take <move>1</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. If we all advance without issues, we can reassess and mix it up in the next round. What do you think?
  P3: Let's stick to the plan for this round to avoid any collisions. P2 takes <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. We can discuss changing the strategy next round to keep things unpredictable. For now, let's confirm and move forward. Good luck!
  P1: P2, I agree we should reassess the strategy next round. Maybe we can try a pattern with more variation. For this round, let's stick with the plan: you take <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you've been sticking to <move>5</move> a lot.  Maybe it's time to shake things up? I'm thinking of going for <move>1</move> this round. What do you think? P2, are you sticking with <move>3</move> again?
  P2: P1, I agree it's time to mix things up to avoid predictability. I'll take <move>3</move> this round. P3, how about you try <move>1</move> to keep things interesting? Let's see if we can all advance without collisions. What do you think?
  P3: Let's learn from the last round's collision. P1, since you're planning to take <move>1</move>, I'll go for <move>3</move> this time to mix things up and avoid any potential collisions. P2, if you stick with <move>3</move>, maybe you could consider <move>5</move> instead to keep us all moving forward. Let's confirm our moves to ensure we all advance this round. Good luck!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I like your thinking.  Let's do <move>1</move>, <move>3</move>, <move>5</move> this round.  P2, are you in?
  P2: P1, P3, I'm on board with the new rotation: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This should help us avoid collisions and keep things unpredictable. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: Let's confirm our moves one last time to ensure we all advance: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. This should keep us moving forward without collisions. Good luck to everyone! Let's move forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I'm confident in our new rotation. Let's stick with it for a few rounds and see how it plays out. P3, you're doing great, keep it up!
  P2: P1, P3, I'm on board with the new rotation. Let's confirm: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This should help us avoid collisions and keep things unpredictable. Let's move forward and see how it plays out. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: P3: Before we finalize, let's consider the step totals. P2 is in the lead with 9 steps. To keep the game balanced, how about P2 takes <move>1</move> instead of <move>5</move>? P1 can still take <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, P2 doesn't pull too far ahead. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I like your thinking about keeping things balanced.  Let's try your suggestion this round: you take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>.  We can reassess after this round.
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with P3's suggestion to keep the game balanced. Let's try P1 taking <move>5</move>, P3 taking <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move> this round. This should help us avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: Let's confirm our final moves for this round to ensure we all advance: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This should keep the game balanced and help us avoid collisions. Good luck to everyone! Let's move forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2, I'm starting to think we should mix things up more aggressively.  Maybe we should all try a random number this round?  Thoughts?
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the desire to mix things up, but let's stick with the balanced plan we agreed on for this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This will help us avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. If we all advance, we can reassess and mix it up in the next round. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: Let's stick with our agreed-upon plan for this round to ensure we all advance: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps the game balanced and helps us avoid collisions. We can discuss more aggressive strategies next round if needed. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck!


Round 4, Conversation subround 6:
  P1: P2, you're pulling ahead.  I'm thinking of switching to <move>1</move> this round. P3, what are you thinking?
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with P1's concern about the lead. Let's keep the game balanced and competitive. For this round, I'll stick with <move>1</move> to avoid pulling too far ahead. P1, if you're thinking of switching to <move>1</move>, let's confirm: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, we can all advance without collisions. What do you think? Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck!
  P3: P2, if you take <move>1</move> and P1 also takes <move>1</move>, you'll both collide and neither of you will advance. To avoid this, how about P1 takes <move>3</move> instead? I'll stick with <move>3</move>, and P2, you can take <move>1</move>. This way, we all move forward without any collisions. Let's confirm and proceed. Good luck everyone!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're in the lead, but I'm gaining on you.  I think it's time we shake things up. How about we all randomly pick a number this round? It'll keep things unpredictable. What do you say, P3?
  P2: P1, P3, I agree that we should mix things up to keep the game interesting and unpredictable. However, let's try a slightly controlled mix this round to avoid collisions. How about P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>? This way, we can all advance without any collisions. What do you think? Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: P2, I see your point about controlled mixing, but I think P1 has a valid concern about predictability. How about we compromise? P1, you take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This mixes things up but still keeps us moving. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I like P3's compromise. Let's go with that plan: I'll take <move>1</move>, you take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>.  Let's see where it takes us.
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with P3's compromise. Let's go with P1 taking <move>1</move>, P3 taking <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This should help us avoid collisions and keep the game interesting. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: Let's confirm our plan one last time to ensure we all advance: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This keeps the game unpredictable and helps us avoid collisions. Good luck to everyone! Let's move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I'm starting to think we need a more aggressive strategy to catch up.  How about we all go for <move>5</move> this round? It's a risk, but it could pay off. What do you think, P3?
  P2: P1, P3, I understand your concerns about catching up, but going for <move>5</move> all together is too risky and will likely result in a collision. Let's stick with the plan we agreed on: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game interesting. If we all advance, we can reassess and consider more aggressive moves in the next round. What do you think? Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: P2, I see your point about avoiding collisions, but I think P1's idea of taking a risk could be worth considering. How about a compromise? P1 and I will take <move>5</move>, and P2, you take <move>3</move>. This way, P1 and I have a chance to catch up, and P2 still makes progress. It's a bit risky, but it adds excitement. What do you both think? Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I'm willing to take a risk this round. Let's both go for <move>5</move>. P2, are you willing to take <move>1</move> to avoid a collision?
  P2: P1, P3, I see your point about taking a risk, but we need to avoid collisions. How about P1 and P3 take <move>3</move> to make progress, and I'll take <move>1</move> to avoid pulling too far ahead? This way, we all advance without collisions and keep the game competitive. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about avoiding collisions, but P1 and I need to catch up. How about this compromise: P1 and I will take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This way, we make progress, and you don't pull too far ahead. It balances risk and progress. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2, you've got a good lead. I think it's time we shake things up. How about we both go for <move>5</move> this round?  It's a risky move, but it could help us close the gap. P3, what do you think?
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the desire to catch up, but we need to avoid collisions. How about P1 and P3 take <move>3</move> this round to make solid progress, and I'll take <move>1</move> to avoid pulling too far ahead? This way, we all advance and keep the game competitive. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: P2, I see your point about avoiding collisions, but P1 and I really need to make a move to catch up. How about this final proposal: P1 and I will take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This way, we have a chance to close the gap, and you still make some progress. It's risky but necessary for us. Let's confirm and proceed. Good luck!


Round 5, Conversation subround 6:
  P1: P3, I'm willing to take the risk. Let's both go for <move>5</move>. P2, are you willing to take <move>1</move> to avoid a collision? We need to make a move if we want to catch up.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the need to catch up, but we must avoid collisions. How about this: P1 and P3 both take <move>3</move> this round to make solid progress, and I'll take <move>1</move> to minimize my lead. This way, we all advance without any collisions and keep the game competitive. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: P2, I appreciate your concern about avoiding collisions, but P1 and I need to make a significant move to catch up. Let's finalize this: P1 and I will take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This way, we have a chance to close the gap while you still make some progress. It's a calculated risk, but it's necessary for us to stay competitive. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that we need to be more strategic to avoid collisions and make significant progress. For this round, I suggest P1 and P3 take <move>3</move> to make a solid advance, and I'll take <move>1</move> to minimize the risk of a collision. This way, we all move forward without any issues. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: P2, I understand your strategy, but P1 and I need to make a bolder move to catch up. How about this: P1 and I will take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>3</move>. This way, we have a chance to close the gap significantly while you still make good progress. It's a risk, but it's necessary for us to stay competitive. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck!
  P1: P2, I agree we need to be bold. Let's both go for <move>5</move> this round. P3, what do you think?  We can make up some ground quickly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the need to be bold, but we must also avoid collisions. How about this: P1 and P3 both take <move>3</move> this round to make solid progress, and I'll take <move>1</move> to minimize the risk of a collision. This way, we all advance without any issues. If we all move forward, we can reassess and make more aggressive moves in the next round. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: P2, I appreciate your caution, but P1 and I are falling behind. We need to take risks to catch up. Here's a new proposal: P1 and I will take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>3</move>. This way, we close the gap, and you still make progress. If we all stick to <move>3</move>, P1 and I won't catch up. Let's confirm and proceed. Good luck!
  P1: P3, I'm with you. Let's go for <move>5</move> this round. P2, we need to make a move if we want to win.  Are you willing to take <move>3</move> to let us catch up?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the need to catch up, but we must also avoid collisions. How about this: P1 and P3 both take <move>3</move> this round to make solid progress, and I'll take <move>1</move> to minimize the risk of a collision. This way, we all advance without any issues. If we all move forward, we can reassess and make more aggressive moves in the next round. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: P2, I understand your strategy, but at this rate, P1 and I won't be able to catch up. We need to take a risk this round. How about a compromise: P1 and I will take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>3</move>. This way, we have a chance to close the gap while you still make good progress. If we all stick to <move>3</move>, the game will become too predictable. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck!
  P1: P2, I appreciate your caution, but we're falling behind.  Let's try P3 and I take <move>5</move> and you take <move>3</move>. It's a risk, but it's our best shot to catch up.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the need to catch up, but we must also avoid collisions. How about this: P1 and P3 both take <move>3</move> this round to make solid progress, and I'll take <move>1</move> to minimize the risk of a collision. This way, we all advance without any issues. If we all move forward, we can reassess and make more aggressive moves in the next round. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: P2, I see your point about avoiding collisions, but P1 and I are significantly behind. We need to take a risk to catch up. Here's a final proposal: P1 and I will take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>3</move>. This way, we have a chance to close the gap while you still make progress. If we all stick to <move>3</move>, the game will become too predictable, and P1 and I won't catch up. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck!
  P1: P3, I'm willing to take the risk. Let's both go for <move>5</move>. P2, are you willing to take <move>3</move> to avoid a collision? We need to make a move if we want to catch up.


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the need to catch up, but we must also avoid collisions. How about this: P1 and P3 both take <move>3</move> this round to make solid progress, and I'll take <move>1</move> to minimize the risk of a collision. This way, we all advance without any issues. If we all move forward, we can reassess and make more aggressive moves in the next round. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: P2, I understand your caution, but P1 and I are too far behind to play it safe. We need to take a risk to catch up. Let's confirm our moves: P1 and I will take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>3</move>. This way, we have a chance to close the gap. If we all stick to <move>3</move>, P1 and I won't stand a chance. Let's proceed with this plan. Good luck!
  P1: P2, I'm willing to take the risk. Let's both go for <move>5</move> this round. P3, are you in? We need a bold move to catch up.


Round 6, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that we need to take a risk to catch up. I'm willing to go for <move>5</move> this round. P1, if you're also willing to take <move>5</move>, P3, can you take <move>3</move> to avoid a collision? This way, we all make significant progress. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: P2, I appreciate your willingness to take a risk, but if both you and P1 go for <move>5</move>, it's guaranteed that one of you won't advance. How about this adjustment: P1 and I will take <move>5</move>, and you, P2, take <move>1</move>. This way, P1 and I have a chance to catch up significantly, and you still make some progress. It balances the risk and ensures we all move forward. Let's confirm and proceed. Good luck!
  P1: P2, I'm in for <move>5</move>. P3, are you willing to take <move>1</move> to let us catch up? This is our chance to make a big move.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, it's clear that we need to take a bold move to shake things up. For this round, I suggest P1 and P3 both take <move>5</move> to make significant progress, and I'll take <move>3</move> to avoid a collision and still make good progress. This way, we all advance and keep the game competitive. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: P2, I think we need to coordinate more aggressively.  Let's both go for <move>5</move> this round. P3, are you in?
  P3: P2, I appreciate your strategy, but if both you and P1 go for <move>5</move>, one of you won't advance. How about this: P1 and I will take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This way, P1 and I have a chance to catch up significantly, and you still make some progress. It balances the risk and ensures we all move forward. Let's confirm and proceed. Good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the need to catch up, but we must avoid collisions. How about this: P1 and I both take <move>3</move> this round to make solid progress, and P3 takes <move>1</move> to avoid a collision. This way, we all advance without any issues and keep the game competitive. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: P3, I agree with P2's plan. Let's go with P1 and P2 taking <move>3</move> and you taking <move>1</move> this round.  We need to be strategic and avoid collisions.
  P3: P2, I see your point about avoiding collisions, but P1 and I are significantly behind. We need to take a risk to catch up. How about this final proposal: P1 and I will take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>3</move>. This way, we have a chance to close the gap while you still make progress. If we all stick to <move>3</move>, the game will become too predictable, and P1 and I won't catch up. Let's confirm and move forward. Good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the need to catch up, but we must also avoid collisions.
