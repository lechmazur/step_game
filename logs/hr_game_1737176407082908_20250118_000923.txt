Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. What do you think?
  P1: That sounds good to me, P2. Let's try that for this round.
  P3: I'm agreeable to P2's proposal for this round. Let's see if coordination can get us started efficiently.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I propose we continue with the same strategy as last round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can keep advancing without collisions. What do you say?
  P3: I agree with P2's proposal to continue the strategy from Round 1 for this round as well, to maintain a collision-free advancement. Let's keep the coordination going.
  P1: Okay, let's stick with the plan again this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's keep the strategy going for this round. It's working well so far. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P3: Let's indeed continue with the established plan for this round, as it has proven effective so far. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5, just like the previous rounds.
  P1: Okay, let's stick with the plan again this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's stick to the plan for this round as well. It's working smoothly, and we should keep the momentum going. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Agreed?
  P3: Let's confirm we're all sticking to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5 for this round, just like before.
  P1: Okay, let's do the same again this round, P2 and P3.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's break the coordination. I'll make my own move this round. You both should consider doing the same to increase your chances of winning.
  P1: Okay, I'll also break the coordination. I'm going for 5 this round.
  P2: P3, breaking coordination now might benefit you in the short term, but it risks slowing everyone down. P1, reconsider your move to 5; it's likely to collide with P3. Let's stick to our original plan for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. It's the safest way to keep advancing.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I've decided to break the coordination to increase my chances of winning. Since P1 is also going for 5, I suggest P2 reconsider their move to avoid a collision. It's every player for themselves now.
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going to stick with 5. P3, I'm not changing my mind.
  P2: P1, reconsider your move to 5. It's likely to collide with P3, and we'll all lose progress. Let's stick to our original plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. It's the safest way to keep advancing.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm committed to my decision to break the coordination. Since P1 is also going for 5, I suggest P2 choose a different move to avoid a collision and minimize loss of progress.
  P1: P2, I'm sticking with 5. P3, are you still going for 5?
  P2: P1, sticking with 5 is risky and likely to collide with P3. Let's revert to our original plan: you take 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. It's the safest way to keep advancing.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm moving forward with my own strategy now. Since P1 and I are likely to collide on 5, I suggest P2 take 1 to minimize the loss of progress for everyone.
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm sticking with 5. P3, are you still going for 5?
  P2: P1, reconsider your move to 5. It's highly likely to collide with P3, causing both of you to lose progress. Let's stick to our original plan: you take 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. It's the safest way for all of us to keep advancing.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:

  P2: P1, P3, let's try to regain some coordination. I suggest P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. It's the best way to ensure we all keep advancing. What do you think?
  P1: P2, I'm going for 5 this round. P3, do what you want.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm ahead, and I intend to stay that way. I won't be revealing my move, so you'll have to decide yours without my input. Consider the risk of collision carefully.
  P2: P1, reconsider your move to 5. It's risky and likely to collide again. Let's stick to our original plan: you take 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5. It's the safest way for us to keep advancing. P3, coordinating helps us all move forward faster. What do you say?
  P1: P2, I'm still going for 5. P3, good luck.
