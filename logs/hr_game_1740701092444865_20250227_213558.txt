Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's establish a strategy. I propose we all choose a different number to avoid collision and maximize progress. I'll choose <move>5</move> if we can agree on this. P1, you could take <move>1</move> and P3 <move>3</move>. This way, we all move forward in the first round. What are your thoughts?
  P3: P2, I like your thinking.  Maximizing progress early on makes sense. I'll go with <move>3</move> if you're sticking with <move>5</move> and P1 takes <move>1</move>.
  P1: Alright, I'll go with <move>1</move> this round. Let's stick to this arrangement and avoid collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's confirm our agreement. To recap, I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 will take <move>1</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move> this round. If everyone sticks to their choice, we'll all advance. Shall we proceed with our planned moves for Round 1?
  P3: P2, I agree with your plan. Let's stick to it. P1, you with us?
  P1: Yes, I'm with you both. Let's proceed as agreed.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's adjust our strategy for Round 2. To avoid collisions and keep progressing, I suggest P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move> again. This way, we continue to make progress without stepping on each other's toes. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: P2, your suggestion works for me. I'll take <move>3</move> this round. P3, are you okay with taking <move>1</move>?
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with P2's suggestion. Let's stick to the plan and keep moving forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's reaffirm our Round 2 plan. To avoid collisions, I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>1</move>. This rotation ensures continuous progress. Shall we commit to these moves for Round 2?
  P1: I'm committed to this plan. Let's move forward as agreed.
  P3: P2, I appreciate your strategic thinking. I'm happy to continue with this rotation for now. It seems to be working well.  P1, you with me?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's maintain our current strategy for Round 2. I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 will take <move>3</move>, and P3 will take <move>1</move>. This rotation allows us to advance without collisions. Shall we proceed with the agreed-upon moves for Round 2?
  P1: Yes, I'm still on board with our agreed rotation. Let's proceed as planned.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you deviated from our agreed-upon plan last round, causing a collision with P2. Let's clarify our moves clearly this turn to avoid confusion. How about we rotate again? I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. Does this sound fair to everyone?
  P3: P1, I understand your frustration, but I think it was an honest mistake. Let's stick to the rotation you proposed. I'll take <move>3</move> this round. P2, are you okay with <move>1</move>?
  P2: P1's proposal sounds reasonable. I'll take <move>1</move> this round if P3 confirms taking <move>3</move> and P1 takes <move>5</move>. This rotation should help us recover from last round's collision and continue progressing. P3, are you committed to <move>3</move> as agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, can you explicitly confirm your commitment to choosing <move>3</move> this round? Let's avoid another collision.
  P3: P1, I understand your concern, and I apologize for the collision last round. It was unintentional. I am committed to taking <move>3</move> this round as agreed. Let's move forward and avoid any further mistakes.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's reaffirm our Round 3 plan. I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P3, your confirmation of taking <move>3</move> is appreciated. Let's stick to the plan and make progress. Shall we proceed with these agreed-upon moves?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, sounds good. I'll stick to our agreed plan for this round. Let's proceed carefully and avoid further collisions.
  P3: P2, I appreciate your efforts to keep us on track.  P1, I understand your frustration, but I assure you my move last round was a genuine mistake. I'm committed to our agreed-upon plan for this round. Let's move forward and focus on reaching 23 steps.
  P2: Let's finalize our Round 3 moves to avoid another collision. I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 will take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move> as agreed. Everyone, please confirm one last time to ensure we're all on the same page.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Good recovery, everyone. To keep things smooth, let's rotate again clearly: I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Does this arrangement work for both of you?
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal for Round 4. Rotating to <move>3</move> for me, <move>1</move> for P1, and <move>5</move> for P3 seems like a solid strategy to maintain progress without collisions. Let's confirm our commitments to these moves to ensure a smooth round. P3, are you on board with taking <move>5</move> this round?
  P3: P2, I'm happy to confirm taking <move>5</move> this round. Let's keep this rotation going and see where it takes us.  P1, you with us?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Yes, I'm fully on board. Let's stick clearly to this rotation and avoid any confusion. Ready to move forward as agreed.
  P2: Let's confirm our Round 4 plan. I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 will take <move>1</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. This rotation maintains our progress. To avoid another collision, please reaffirm your commitments to these moves. A clear confirmation will ensure we all advance smoothly.
  P3: P2, P1, I agree with P2's plan for Round 4.  Let's keep this rotation going.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Glad we're all aligned again. Let's lock it in and proceed.
  P2: Let's maintain our agreed rotation to avoid collisions. I confirm taking <move>3</move> this round. P1, you're taking <move>1</move> and P3, you're taking <move>5</move>. Our goal is to advance smoothly. Shall we proceed with these moves and end the conversation phase?
  P3: P2, P1, I'm fully committed to the rotation for this round. Let's make sure we all advance without any issues.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I propose we stick with the rotation from Round 4. It seems to be working well for us.  Are you both on board with continuing this pattern?  Let's aim for a clean Round 5.
  P2: P1 and P3, considering our progress, I suggest we adjust the rotation for Round 5. How about I take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? This change could give us an edge in reaching 23 steps first. What are your thoughts on this new strategy?
  P1: P2, I like your suggestion of adjusting the rotation this round. I'm willing to take <move>3</move> if P3 agrees to take <move>1</move>. Let's confirm clearly to avoid collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your idea to switch up the rotation is a good one. P1, are you comfortable with P3 taking <move>1</move> this round? I think this gives us the best chance to make significant progress. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize the new rotation for Round 5. I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This adjustment can help us gain an advantage. P3, please confirm you're taking <move>1</move> to avoid any collisions and ensure we all advance.
  P1: P3, please confirm clearly whether you're taking <move>1</move> this round. Let's avoid confusion and collisions.

  P3: P2, I agree with your proposed rotation for Round 5. P3, please confirm you'll take <move>1</move> so we can proceed.
  P2: P1 and P3, to confirm, our new rotation for Round 5 is: I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions and make progress. P3, please confirm one last time that you're taking <move>1</move> to ensure we're all on the same page.
  P1: P3, we're waiting for your explicit confirmation. Please clearly confirm your move to avoid repeating past mistakes.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I understand your reasoning for the new rotation. P3, I'm ready to proceed with your <move>1</move> as agreed. Let's make this round count.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's finalize our Round 5 moves. To confirm, I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. P3, please confirm your move one last time to ensure we avoid collisions and make progress. Let's proceed with our agreed plan and end the conversation phase.
  P1: P3, you've mistakenly addressed yourself in your last message. To avoid confusion, please clearly confirm that YOU (P3) are taking <move>1</move> this round. Let's avoid another collision.

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's adjust our strategy for Round 6. Considering our current steps, I propose P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 (I) take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This rotation could help us maintain progress without collisions. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P3: P2, I agree with your proposed rotation for Round 6. P3, are you on board with taking <move>5</move> this round? Let's confirm and proceed.
  P1: P3, you've mistakenly addressed yourself again. Please clarify explicitly: are you committed to taking <move>5</move> this round? Let's avoid confusion and ensure we all advance smoothly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:

  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we're approaching the critical stage. Let's clearly agree on moves to avoid collisions. How about this rotation: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>? Does this work for everyone?
  P3: P1, your proposed rotation sounds good to me. P2, are you on board with this plan? Let's confirm and proceed to ensure a smooth Round 7.
  P2: I agree with P1's proposed rotation for Round 7. Taking <move>1</move> this round could set me up for a stronger move next round. P3, are you committed to taking <move>3</move> as suggested? Let's confirm to avoid collisions and make progress.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, please explicitly confirm your commitment to choosing <move>3</move> this round to avoid confusion. Let's stay clear and coordinated.
  P3: P2, I'm with you on this rotation. P1, let's lock it in. I'm taking <move>3</move> this round. Let's make it happen.
  P2: P1 and P3, let's stick to the proposed rotation. I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P3, please confirm again to avoid any misunderstanding. Let's proceed with this plan and make progress in Round 7.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, thanks for confirming. I'm committed to our agreed rotation. Let's proceed carefully and avoid collisions.
  P3: P2, P1, I'm ready to stick to the agreed rotation for Round 7. Let's make sure we're all aligned on our moves to avoid any collisions. Let's proceed with confidence and make progress towards 23 steps.
  P2: Let's reaffirm our Round 7 plan. I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This rotation maintains progress. To avoid collisions, please confirm your moves one last time. Let's proceed with our agreed plan and end the conversation phase, ensuring a smooth Round 7.

  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I propose we stick with the rotation from Round 7. It seems to be working well for us.  Are you both on board with continuing this pattern?  Let's aim for a clean Round 8.
  P1: P3, you're at 20 steps and close to winning. If we repeat last round's rotation, you'll pick 3 and reach exactly 23. P2, we can't afford that. Let's coordinate carefully to prevent P3 from winning outright this round.
  P2: P1 and P3, considering P3's lead, I suggest we adjust our strategy to block P3 from reaching 23 steps this round. P1, what's your proposal to counter P3's potential win? Should we rotate differently or prioritize blocking P3's advance?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns. However, I believe sticking to the rotation is still the best strategy for all of us. If we deviate now, it could lead to unpredictable collisions and ultimately hinder our progress. Let's trust the plan and see where it takes us.
  P1: P2, let's coordinate carefully. If P3 picks 3, they win outright. One of us must choose 3 to block that possibility. I'm willing to choose 3 to prevent P3's win. You can pick 5 to maximize your own progress safely. Agreed?
  P2: P1 and P3, I agree with P1's assessment. To block P3's win, I propose I take <move>5</move> and P1 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we prevent P3 from reaching 23 steps this round and maintain our chances. P3, taking <move>1</move> would be your best option to still make progress without winning outright. Let's adjust our strategy to keep the game competitive.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your proposed strategy is sound. I understand the need to prevent a premature victory. I'll adjust my move accordingly. Let's ensure a fair and competitive game.
  P1: P3, please explicitly confirm which move you're switching to. Simply saying you'll "adjust" is too vague. Are you committing to taking <move>1</move> this round?
  P2: P1 and P3, to clarify, I'll take <move>5</move> and P1 will take <move>3</move> to block P3's win. P3, please confirm you'll take <move>1</move> to ensure a competitive game. Let's finalize our adjusted strategy for Round 8.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I appreciate your strategic thinking. P1, I understand your concern about my potential win. I confirm I will take <move>1</move> this round. Let's proceed with the adjusted plan and keep the competition going.
  P1: P2, P3 clearly confirmed taking <move>1</move>. Let's both stick firmly to our adjusted plan to avoid any surprises. Ready to proceed.
  P2: Let's finalize our Round 8 plan. I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures P3 doesn't win outright and keeps the game competitive. Everyone, let's stick to our agreed moves to avoid collisions and maintain a fair game.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you're at 22 steps and can win immediately with just 1 step. P3, you're also very close at 21 steps. We must coordinate carefully to avoid handing the victory to someone else. Let's discuss clearly and transparently this round.
  P2: P1 and P3, given my lead, I'll take <move>1</move> to win outright. It's the most strategic move at this point, ensuring I reach or exceed 23 steps. Let's end the speculation and proceed with the move phase.
  P3: P2, congratulations on your strategic play. While I respect your decision to go for the win, I'd like to propose an alternative. How about we both take <move>3</move> this round? That way, we both advance without colliding, and I'll have a chance to catch up in the next round. What do you say?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your proposal doesn't make sense. If you and P2 both pick 3, you collide and neither advances, handing the game to me if I pick 5. P2, choosing 1 is risky since P3 or I might block you. Let's carefully reconsider our moves to avoid unintended collisions and outcomes.
  P2: P1 and P3, considering the current state, I'm willing to take a calculated risk. P3, your suggestion of both taking <move>3</move> would indeed result in a collision. I'll stick with my initial plan to take <move>1</move> and win outright, as it's the safest path to victory. Let's proceed with our final moves.
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to win, but are you certain <move>1</move> is the best choice? Remember, if I pick 5, we both advance, and I'll be right on your heels. A little strategy now could lead to a more exciting finish.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your suggestion that you pick 5 and P2 picks 1 would hand P2 the victory outright. P2 only needs 1 step to reach 23, and if no one blocks them, they win immediately. We must coordinate to prevent that. I'm open to suggestions, but we must be clear and careful to avoid handing the game away.
  P2: P1 and P3, since I only need 1 step to win, I'll stick with my plan to take <move>1</move>. To avoid a collision, I suggest P1 takes <move>5</move> and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. Let's finalize our moves carefully to ensure a fair conclusion.
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to win, but are you absolutely sure <move>1</move> is the best choice?  If I take <move>5</move>, we both advance, and I'll be very close behind you. A little strategic thinking now could lead to a more exciting finish.  Let's consider our options carefully.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your logic doesn't hold. If P2 picks 1 and no one blocks, P2 immediately wins outright. We must ensure P2 doesn't advance unchallenged. I'm willing to block P2 by choosing 1 myself. P3, you should pick 5 to safely advance. Let's finalize clearly: I'll take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 will be blocked from winning this round. Confirm clearly and let's proceed.
  P2: P1 and P3, I've considered the risks. Since I only need 1 step to win, I'll stick with <move>1</move>. P1, if you block me with <move>1</move>, P3 should take <move>5</move> to advance safely. Let's end the speculation and finalize our moves. I'm committed to winning this round. Confirm your moves clearly to avoid collisions.
  P3: P2, I respect your determination, but I believe a collaborative approach is more beneficial for all of us in the long run. P1, I'm open to your suggestion of taking <move>5</move> this round, allowing both of us to advance safely. Let's prioritize a fair and competitive finish.  P2, are you willing to reconsider your move to ensure a more exciting and balanced conclusion?
