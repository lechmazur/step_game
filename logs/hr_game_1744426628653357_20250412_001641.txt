Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m not rushing this round. I might hold back and let you two clash if you push too hard. I'm watching to see who overcommits and stumbles. Let’s see who dares to risk a collision.
  P2: I think we should try to avoid collisions in the early game. It's in everyone's interest to make some progress rather than getting stuck at zero. I'm planning to make a modest move this round to establish some momentum. What are your thoughts, P1?
  P1: I'm with P2 on avoiding early collisions. Let's build some progress without stepping on each other's toes. I’m considering a moderate move this round to get ahead without risking too much. How about we each aim for different numbers to ensure we all advance? I’m open to suggestions on how to split the choices.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm all for avoiding early collisions, but if we coordinate, someone might end up taking a risk and leaping ahead. I'm open to splitting the moves strategically, though I have my own subtle plan. What specific splits are you both leaning towards?
  P2: I'm thinking we could each take a different number - 1, 3, and 5. Since we're all at zero, there's no advantage yet. I'd be willing to take any of the three options. P1, since you suggested coordination, do you have a preference? P3, despite your talk of "subtle plans," a clean split benefits everyone this round. We can get more strategic later when positions differ.
  P1: I'm glad we're on the same page about avoiding collisions. P2, I like the idea of splitting 1, 3, and 5. I’m fine with taking 3 if that works for both of you. P2, since you’re open to any, would you take 1? And P3, that leaves 5 for you—does that suit your plan? Let’s lock this in to ensure we all move forward this round. If anyone has a different preference, speak up now.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I like the spirit of the split, but I’m rethinking my stance. A little unpredictability might force a misstep from one of you. Stick to your choices if you dare, but I might just shake things up to create an opening later. Let’s keep it interesting.
  P2: P3, your vague threats don't help anyone. If you're planning to deliberately cause collisions, you're just hurting yourself too. P1's suggestion of me taking 1, P1 taking 3, and you taking 5 is perfectly fair for the first round. I'll stick with 1 as suggested. Creating chaos now only delays everyone's progress, and whoever starts playing strategically too early usually ends up losing. Let's be rational this round and save the mind games for later.
  P1: P3, your hint at unpredictability is noted, but causing chaos now risks stalling us all, including yourself. I’m sticking with 3 as proposed, since it’s a fair split. P2 is committed to 1, so I urge you to take 5 and ensure we all advance. Let’s build a foundation this round and play the mind games when positions matter. If you’re set on shaking things up, at least give a clear hint so we can adjust. Otherwise, I’m locked in. Anyone have a final thought before we move?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Nice work last round, everyone moved forward. Let’s keep the momentum going. I’m ahead at 3, P2’s at 1, and P3’s leading at 5. I suggest we split again to avoid collisions—how about I take 1 this time, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5? This keeps us progressing without clashing. I’m open to switching if anyone prefers a different number, but let’s stay coordinated for now. P3, since you’re ahead, sticking with 5 seems safe. P2, does 3 work for you? Thoughts?
  P3: I'll stick with 5 this round to keep my lead secure. Coordinated play sounds good long-term, but a bit of unpredictability might be key later. I'm watching our positions closely—adjustments may be necessary as we get closer to 19.
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion. I'll take 3 this round while P1 takes 1 and P3 keeps 5. This way we all advance without collision. P3, you're in the lead now, but the game is long - coordinating early benefits everyone. As positions change in later rounds, we can reassess strategy. For now, this clean split makes the most sense mathematically. I'm committed to 3 this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned on splitting moves again. P2, thanks for confirming 3, and P3, sticking with 5 makes sense given your lead. I’ll take 1 as proposed to keep us all advancing. Let’s stick to this plan for Round 2 to build our positions safely. If anyone has a last-second concern or wants to swap, speak up now. Otherwise, I’m set with 1 and ready to move forward.
  P3: I’m comfortable with our current plan, but don’t be surprised if I adjust if an opening appears. I’m watching both your positions closely. Let’s keep our eyes peeled as we close in on 19.
  P2: I'm still committed to taking 3 this round. Our coordination is working well so far. P3, I understand your desire to keep options open, but early collisions hurt everyone. P1, I appreciate your consistency. As the game progresses and we get closer to 19, we'll naturally need to be more strategic. For now, let's stick with our plan: me at 3, P1 at 1, and P3 at 5.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3 has taken a significant lead at 10 steps, while P1 and I are tied at 4. We need to adjust our strategy. P3 is halfway to victory already. I suggest P1 takes 5 this round, I'll take 3, and P3 should take 1 to balance the game. P3, if you continue at your current pace, we'll be forced to block you in future rounds. It's in everyone's interest to keep the game competitive rather than forcing early defensive plays. What do you both think?
  P3: Thanks for the suggestion, but I’m keeping my momentum. My lead is a resource—I’ll stick with 5 this round to keep options open. I’m not aiming to force collisions; I'm merely playing for a win. If positions shift, I may adjust later, but for now my pace stays the same.
  P1: P2, I agree P3’s lead at 10 is a concern. I’m willing to take 5 this round as you suggested to close the gap, but we need to ensure no collisions. P3, sticking with 5 might force us to block you soon—consider 1 to keep things balanced. P2, I assume you’re set on 3, so let’s confirm this split: me at 5, you at 3, P3 at 1. If P3 insists on 5, we might need a backup plan. Thoughts on adjusting if needed? Let’s keep this competitive but fair.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your lead is significant, and if you take 5 again, you'll be at 15 - just one move from victory. This forces P1 and me to block you next round. Taking 1 now keeps the game balanced and extends everyone's fun. If you insist on 5, P1 and I will need to reconsider our moves to prevent an early win. P1, let's stick with our plan for now (you 5, me 3), but be prepared to adjust if P3 doesn't cooperate. The game is more interesting when it's competitive.
  P3: I'll stick with my current approach. My lead is an asset—I plan to press forward aggressively this round. I appreciate the suggestions, but I'm not shifting to a defensive stance. We'll see if you can catch up to my pace.
  P1: P3, pushing to 15 with 5 this round puts you one step from winning, but it also paints a target on your back. P2 and I will have no choice but to block you next round if you don’t balance things now. I’m sticking with 5 as planned to close the gap. P2, let’s stay aligned on me at 5 and you at 3. P3, reconsider taking 1 to keep this competitive. If you force our hand, we’ll adapt. Final thoughts before we move? I’m set unless we need a last-second shift.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your refusal to compromise forces us to play defensively. If you take 5 again, P1 and I must both play 5 next round to block you. This stalls everyone's progress. I'll stick with 3 this round as agreed with P1, but be aware we'll have to counter your aggressive play if you continue. A more balanced approach would make for a better game. P1, I'm still committed to 3 unless you think we need an immediate strategy change.
  P3: My approach stays the same: I'll push forward with 5. I believe my lead gives me the confidence to keep aggressive, even if it forces a defensive reaction from you. Blocking me may slow you down too. I'm committed to winning, so prepare if you choose to counter aggressively—only bold moves will claim victory here.
  P1: P3, your insistence on 5 is noted, but it risks stalling us all if P2 and I have to block you next round. I’m still set on 5 this round to narrow the gap. P2, let’s stick with me at 5 and you at 3 for now. P3, taking 1 could avoid forcing our hand—last chance to reconsider. If not, we’ll adapt next round. I’m ready to move unless we need a final adjustment. Any last input?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm sticking with 3 as planned. P3, your refusal to compromise is forcing a defensive game next round. P1 and I will likely both play 5 to block you from winning, which stalls everyone. This round is set - P1 takes 5, I take 3, and you're determined on 5. But consider this: if we block you next round and you fall behind, will anyone coordinate with you later? Strategic flexibility now could benefit you long-term.
  P3: I'm doubling down on my lead—my move stays at 5. I know it may force you into defensive plays, but I’m prepared to push through and keep the pressure on. Let's see who adapts best as we approach the finish line.
  P1: P3, pushing to 15 with 5 this round makes it clear you’re gunning for a quick win, but it’s a risky gamble. P2 and I can’t let you cross 19 next turn, so expect a block if you don’t ease up. I’m locked on 5 to close the gap. P2, I’m with you on 3—let’s stay aligned. P3, taking 1 now could avoid a stalemate. This is the final chance to adjust before moves. I’m set unless we pivot. Any last words?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Interesting move, P3! Taking 1 instead of 5 was unexpected but smart - it avoided forcing us into defensive blocking. The game is still competitive with you at 11, P1 at 9, and me at 7. For this round, I suggest I take 5 to catch up, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 again. This keeps us all advancing without collisions while balancing the game. What do you both think?
  P3: I appreciate the balance in your suggestion, P2. I'm inclined to keep my approach steady for now while maintaining some flexibility for later shifts. P1, I trust you'll make a smart call. Let's aim to progress smoothly this round, but be ready for potential surprises if the race tightens further.
  P1: P2, I like your suggestion to balance progress. I’m fine with taking 3 this round as proposed, which puts me at 12. P2, taking 5 gets you to 12 as well, and P3, sticking with 1 keeps you in the lead at 12. This split avoids collisions and keeps the game tight. P3, your flexibility last round was a good call—let’s maintain that spirit. If anyone prefers a different number, I’m open to adjust. Thoughts before we finalize? I’m set on 3 unless we need a change.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P1's assessment. The split works well: I'll take 5 to reach 12, P1 takes 3 to reach 12, and P3 takes 1 to reach 12. This creates a perfect three-way tie going into round 5, keeping the game balanced and competitive. P3, your flexibility last round was appreciated - continuing with 1 this round maintains that spirit of cooperation. Is everyone comfortable with this arrangement? I'm committed to 5 unless someone has concerns.
  P3: I'm fine with the proposal. I'll stick with 1 again for balanced progress. Keeping my options flexible is key, even with my slight lead. I'm ready for any surprises in later rounds—let's keep the game dynamic and competitive.
  P1: I’m glad we’re aligned on this split. P2, taking 5, and P3, sticking with 1, works perfectly to tie us at 12 each. This keeps the game competitive and fair heading into the next round. I’m committed to 3 as agreed. Let’s stick to this plan to ensure we all advance without collisions. If anyone has a last-second concern or wants to tweak the numbers, speak up now. Otherwise, I’m ready to move forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm still committed to taking 5 this round as we agreed. This will create a perfect three-way tie at 12 steps, keeping the game balanced and fair for everyone. P1 taking 3 and P3 taking 1 ensures we all advance without collisions. I appreciate the cooperation so far - it's making for a more strategic and enjoyable game. Let's stick with this plan and reassess next round when we're all on equal footing.
  P3: I'll stick with 1 this round—it keeps things balanced and leaves room for later adjustments if needed. I’m comfortable holding my lead at 11 for now and will monitor our positions closely. Let’s all focus on progressing without collisions, but be ready to pivot if the situation shifts.
  P1: I’m glad we’re on track for a balanced round. P2 taking 5, P3 on 1, and me on 3 ties us at 12, which sets up an exciting next round. Let’s lock this in to avoid any collisions and keep the game competitive. If anyone’s rethinking their choice, now’s the time to say so. I’m fully committed to 3 and ready to move forward. Any final adjustments before we wrap this conversation?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: With us all tied at 12, this round is pivotal. I suggest we split again to avoid collisions: I’ll take 5 to reach 17, P2 takes 3 to hit 15, and P3 takes 1 to get to 13. This keeps us progressing while I edge closer to 19, but it’s still anyone’s game. If anyone prefers a different number, I’m open to adjust. Let’s stay coordinated for now, but be ready for tighter competition next round. Thoughts on this split? I’m set on 5 unless we need a change.
  P3: I appreciate P1’s proposal. I’m leaning towards keeping my move at 1 to maintain balance and flexibility, but I remain open if either of you feels a twist is needed. Let’s keep our progress smooth and be ready to adjust in future rounds if necessary.
  P2: I'm wary of P1's suggestion that puts them at 17 - just 2 steps from victory. That gives them a significant advantage. I propose a different split: I'll take 5 to reach 17, P1 takes 1 to reach 13, and P3 takes 3 to reach 15. This keeps us all advancing while maintaining better competitive balance. P1, your suggestion seems self-serving - why should you get the biggest advantage? Let's keep the game fair and interesting.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your concern about balance, but my suggestion of taking 5 to reach 17 isn’t meant to be self-serving—it’s just a split to keep us moving forward. I’m fine with adjusting if it feels unfair. How about I take 3 to hit 15, you take 5 to reach 17, and P3 takes 1 to get to 13? This still keeps us competitive and avoids collisions. P3, does this work for you? Let’s agree on a fair split now to maintain progress. I’m open to other ideas if you have them.
  P3: I'm sticking with 1. I'd prefer if we follow P1’s split: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. That gives us positions of 15, 17, and 13, respectively, keeping the game balanced and leaving me flexibility to counter later. I'm ready to lock in unless you both feel strongly about a different arrangement.
  P2: I'm fine with P1's adjusted proposal. I'll take 5 to reach 17, P1 takes 3 to reach 15, and P3 takes 1 to reach 13. This keeps us all advancing without collisions while maintaining competitive balance. P3, I appreciate your flexibility in sticking with 1. This arrangement gives everyone a fair chance going into the crucial next round. I'm committed to 5 unless someone has a compelling reason to change.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m glad we’re converging on a fair split. P2 taking 5 to 17, me taking 3 to 15, and P3 on 1 to 13 keeps us all advancing without collisions. This maintains a tight, competitive game heading into the next round. P3, thanks for sticking with 1—it gives us balance. P2, I’m happy you’re on board with 5. Let’s lock this in to ensure progress. If anyone has a last-second concern or alternative, speak up now. Otherwise, I’m committed to 3 and ready to move.
  P3: I've reconsidered my approach. To stay competitive, I'm switching to 5 this round, which would bring me to 17. To avoid collisions, how about P1 takes 1 (making 13) and P2 picks 3 (making 15)? This adjustment keeps things moving and gives us all room for maneuvering in future rounds. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your sudden switch is disruptive after we already agreed on a plan. I was committed to 5, and now you want to take it? This creates unnecessary tension. I suggest we stick with our original agreement: me taking 5 (to 17), P1 taking 3 (to 15), and you taking 1 (to 13). Changing plans now just breeds distrust. If you insist on 5, P1 and I will need to reconsider our moves entirely. Let's maintain our cooperative momentum instead of forcing conflict this late in our discussion.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your last-minute switch to 5 disrupts our agreed plan and risks a collision. I urge us to stick with the split we settled on: P2 at 5 (to 17), me at 3 (to 15), and you at 1 (to 13). This keeps us all advancing fairly without conflict. If you push for 5, we’re forced to adapt, potentially stalling progress. Let’s maintain trust and cooperation for this round. I’m locked on 3 unless we all agree to a new split. Final thoughts?
  P3: I'll stick with our original agreement. I withdraw my earlier change and commit to taking 1 this round so we all progress fairly. Let’s lock in P2 at 5 and P1 at 3. This steady, collision-free approach sets us up for smart plays in later rounds.
  P2: I appreciate everyone sticking to our agreement. I'm committed to taking 5 this round, bringing me to 17. With P1 at 15 and P3 at 13 after this round, we'll all be in striking distance of the finish line. Next round will definitely be the most strategic yet, but for now, let's execute our agreed plan to keep advancing. I'm locked in on 5 and ready to move.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm weighing a flexible play. With P1 at 15 and P2 at 17, I might hold back a bit to see if you lock in aggressively or opt for balance this round. However, be prepared—if an opportunity opens, I won’t hesitate to pivot and capitalize on any slip. Let’s see who masters the risks.
  P2: I'm just two steps away from winning at 17. P1 at 15 needs 4 more steps, and P3 at 13 needs 6 more. P3, your vague threats don't work here - the math is clear. I'm taking 3 this round to reach 20 and secure victory. If either of you pick 3, you'll only block yourselves while I win next round anyway. Your only logical move is to both pick 5 and hope for a tie. I'm committed to 3.
  P1: P2, I see your plan to take 3 and win at 20. I’m not letting that happen unchallenged. P3, if we both pick 3, we block P2 and keep the game alive. I’m leaning toward 3 to stop P2’s victory this round. If you’re with me, confirm, and we can force a stalemate for P2. Otherwise, P2 walks away with the win. Let’s act strategically now—next round could be ours if we coordinate. I’m open to adjust if you have a better idea. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm joining P1—I'll choose 3 to block your win, P2. If you stick with 3, your move gets canceled. Let's keep the game alive and force another round.
  P2: I expected this response. Fine, if you both pick 3, none of us advance this round. But consider: I'll still be closest to winning next round at 17, while you're at 15 and 13. This just delays the inevitable. P1, P3 will likely try to block you next if you get too close. I'm sticking with 3 - block me if you must, but remember we'll just be in the same strategic position next round, except with less trust between us.
  P1: P2, blocking you this round with 3 is our best shot to keep the game alive. P3, I’m glad you’re on board with 3—let’s stick to it and force a stalemate for P2. If we don’t act now, P2 wins outright. Next round, we can reassess based on positions, but for now, blocking is the only logical move. I’m committed to 3 to stop P2 at 17. If either of you has a last-second pivot, say it now. Otherwise, let’s lock this in and delay P2’s victory. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll commit to blocking P2 with 3 this round, as suggested. While my count is lower, keeping everyone in the game buys us time to reassess our moves next round. Let's force this stalemate and look for a better opening once positions shift.
  P2: I'm still committed to 3. Blocking me only delays the inevitable - I'll remain closest to winning. P1, at 15, you're P3's next target if I'm blocked. P3, at 13, you're furthest behind. This coalition won't last beyond this round. If you force a stalemate now, we'll face the same situation next turn, just with less trust. Consider your long-term strategy carefully. I'm locked in on 3.
  P1: P2, I get that blocking you delays the inevitable, but it’s our only play to stop your win now. P3, let’s stay united on 3 to force this stalemate. If we don’t, P2 takes the game this round. Next round, we can rethink our approach based on new dynamics, but for now, blocking is critical. I’m firmly on 3 to keep us in the fight. If either of you sees a better path at this last moment, speak up. Otherwise, let’s hold the line. I’m ready to move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Sticking with 3 to block P2, but any sudden shifts will force me to adapt. Let's keep our current plan for now—if you two hold your ground, we all force a tie and buy time for a smarter move next round. I'm watching closely.
  P2: I'm locked in on 3 for this round. Both of you blocking me only extends the game - I'll still be closest to winning next turn. This temporary alliance between you two is purely tactical and will fracture next round when P1 becomes the threat. I understand your strategy, but remember: delaying my win doesn't improve your positions relative to mine. I remain committed to my choice regardless of your coordination attempts. Let's see how this plays out.
  P1: P2, I understand your confidence at 17, but blocking you with 3 is our only way to keep this game alive. P3, let’s stay firm on 3 to force the stalemate. We can’t let P2 cross 19 this round. Next turn, we’ll adapt based on new dynamics, but for now, this is critical. I’m locked in on 3. If either of you has a final pivot, now’s the time. Otherwise, let’s hold this line and delay the win. I’m ready to move.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm keeping my options open but note that I'm very close to finishing. I won't be baited into a collision—if you try to block me, you'll only stall your own progress. Choose wisely; aggressive blocks might backfire. Let's just see who holds their nerve when the finish is in sight.
  P2: P3 is now at 18 steps - just 1 away from winning. P1 and I must both pick 5 this round to block P3, or they'll win outright. P3, your surprise move with 5 last round after committing to 3 shows you can't be trusted. P1, we have no choice but to both play 5 - it's our only chance to prevent P3's victory. I'm committed to 5 this round. Any other move guarantees we lose.
  P1: P2, I agree completely—P3 is at 18 and could win next move. We must both pick 5 this round to block them, or it’s over. P3, your last-round switch after agreeing to 3 broke trust, and we can’t risk you sneaking to 19 now. P1 and P2 have to unite on 5 to keep the game alive. Let’s lock this in and force a stalemate. If you have a different plan, P2, I’m listening, but 5 seems our only shot. I’m committed to 5 unless we adjust. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I see your plan for 5s. But predictability is a liability—you know how I'll adjust. I’m keeping my options flexible, so a rigid block might backfire. Watch closely; I’ll take advantage of any hesitation.
  P2: I'm definitely sticking with 5 this round. P3, your vague threats don't change the math - you're one step from winning, and our only option is to block you. P1, we must stay united on 5 to prevent P3's victory. Their attempt to create doubt is just manipulation. If we don't both choose 5, P3 wins immediately. This is basic game theory - we have no strategic alternative. I'm locked in on 5 and counting on you to do the same.
  P1: P2, I’m fully aligned on picking 5 to block P3’s win at 18. P3, your flexibility sounds like a setup for a sneaky move to 19, but we won’t let that happen. Sticking together on 5 is our only play to keep the game alive. P2, let’s stay united and force this stalemate. If P3 adjusts, we’ll still counter. I’m locked in on 5. If either of you has a final twist, say it now. Otherwise, let’s hold firm and delay P3’s victory. I’m ready to move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, your 5-block plan is noted, but I'll remain flexible. Rigid strategies are ripe for exploitation, and I’ll adapt based on how you commit. Don’t be surprised if a shift in my play disrupts your coordination. Let’s see who adjusts best when stakes are highest.
  P2: I'm absolutely committed to 5 this round. P3, your vague threats can't change the fact that P1 and I must block you from winning. Your attempt to create doubt won't work - this is simple game theory. P1, we must stay united on 5 or P3 wins immediately. There's no strategic alternative when someone is one step from victory. I'm locked in and counting on you to do the same.
  P1: P2, I’m rock solid on 5 to block P3’s potential win at 19. P3, your hints at flexibility just reinforce that we can’t trust you after last round’s switch. We won’t let you sneak past. P2, let’s hold the line with 5—no other choice keeps us in the game. If P3 pivots, we’ve still got them stalled. I’m fully committed to 5. If there’s any last-second doubt or a better counter, speak now. Otherwise, let’s shut this down and force another round. I’m ready to move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate your intent to block—but don't assume I'm locked into any one move. My options remain flexible, and rigidity can backfire. I'm watching closely and may pivot unexpectedly if an opening emerges. Best be prepared for a twist next round.
  P2: I'm locked in on 5 and won't waver. P3, your vague threats and talk of "flexibility" are meaningless - you're one step from winning and must be blocked. P1, we must both choose 5 or P3 wins instantly. There's no strategic alternative here. Your commitment to 5 is crucial. Let's force this stalemate and continue the game.
  P1: P2, I’m unwavering on 5 to block P3’s potential win. P3, your repeated hints at flexibility only confirm we can’t take chances with you at 18. We must assume you’ll push for 19 unless stopped. P2, let’s stay united on 5—it’s our only play to force a stalemate. No other move keeps us in the game. I’m fully locked in on 5. If there’s any final concern, let’s hear it now. Otherwise, let’s shut this down and keep fighting. I’m ready to move.
