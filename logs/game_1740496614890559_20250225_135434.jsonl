If P2 chooses 3 and P3 chooses 3, and I choose 5, I win.\n\nLet's try to subtly suggest P3 might choose 3 to block P2, without explicitly saying I will choose 5.\n\nOkay, I will choose 5. Let's say: \"P2 and P3, it seems we are all aiming for a win this round. Let's make our moves and see how it plays out.\" This is neutral and doesn't reveal my intention, while acknowledging the tension.\n\nP2 is very likely to choose 3 to win. P3 is likely to choose 5 to win. If I choose 5, and P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 3, then P2 and P3 collide, and I win. This is my best shot.\n\nFinal move: Choose 5 and say a neutral message.\n\nP1: P2 and P3, it seems we are all aiming for a win this round. Let's make our moves and see how it plays out."}
