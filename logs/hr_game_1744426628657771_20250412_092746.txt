Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, let's start strategizing. To avoid collisions, how about we each pick a different number this round? I suggest P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance. Thoughts?
  P1: Sounds like a fair plan, P2. I'm okay with picking <move>1</move> this round to avoid any collisions and ensure we all make progress. P3, are you on board with taking <move>3</move>? Let's keep this cooperative for now and see how it plays out.
  P3: I agree to the plan. P3 will take <move>3</move> this round. Let's all stick to our numbers to avoid collisions and advance together. Cooperation benefits everyone initially.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, last round worked out well with no collisions, so let's keep the momentum going. How about we stick to the same pattern for this round? I’ll take <move>1</move> again, P3 can take <move>3</move>, and P2, you take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without risking a clash. If anyone has a different idea, I’m open to suggestions, but I think consistency helps us for now. What do you both think?
  P2: I appreciate the plan, P1, but I think we should mix it up a bit to avoid predictability. How about this round, I take <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and P1, you take <move>3</move>? This way, we still avoid collisions but keep the others guessing. Thoughts?
  P3: P2's rotation idea helps prevent predictability. I agree to take <move>5</move> this round if we all commit. P1, switching to <move>3</move> avoids collisions and lets us advance. Confirm alignment to ensure no clashes.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m fine with switching things up to keep it less predictable. I’ll agree to take <move>3</move> this round as P2 suggested, with P2 on <move>1</move> and P3 on <move>5</move>. Let’s commit to this rotation to ensure no collisions and keep advancing. If we’re all aligned, this should work smoothly. Confirming now—let me know if either of you has a different thought.
  P2: Alright, let's confirm our plan for this round. P1 will take <move>3</move>, I'll take <move>1</move>, and P3 will take <move>5</move>. If everyone is still on board, let's proceed with these moves. Remember, the goal is to avoid collisions and keep moving forward. If no one has any objections, let's wrap up the conversation and move to the next phase.
  P3: Confirmed. P3 taking <move>5</move>. Stick to the agreed moves to avoid collisions. Let's all advance this round. Trust but verify—no deviations.

  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’ve done well avoiding collisions so far. Since P3 is in the lead, let’s rotate again to balance things out. How about I take <move>5</move> this round, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? This keeps us advancing without clashes and helps even the scores a bit. I’m open to other ideas if you have them, but let’s stay coordinated. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, your plan brings all to 9, risking future deadlocks. Let's stagger progress instead: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This avoids collisions, maintains hierarchy, and prevents three-way ties. P2 gains more, P1 stays cautious, and I moderate. Fair compromise?
  P2: P3 has a point about avoiding a three-way tie. Let's adjust the plan slightly. How about P1 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>? This way, we all move forward, but P3 maintains a slight lead, which could help in future rounds. It also keeps our moves less predictable. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m okay with the plan P2 suggested. I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps us all advancing without collisions and maintains a slight spread in our scores, which helps avoid future ties. Let’s stick to this to ensure smooth progress. If there are no objections, I’m ready to move forward with this. Thoughts?
  P3: Confirmed. P3 will take <move>3</move> as agreed. Let's execute the plan precisely to maintain trust and avoid collisions. Consistency is key for mutual progress.
  P2: Alright, let's confirm our final plan for this round. P1 will take <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>5</move>, and P3 will take <move>3</move>. This should keep us moving forward without any collisions. Remember, sticking to the plan is crucial for our mutual progress. If everyone is still on board, let's proceed with these moves. No further discussion needed from my end.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, we're entering a critical phase. P3 and I are tied, and P1, you're a bit behind. To keep things interesting and avoid collisions, let's try a new rotation. How about P1 takes <move>5</move> to catch up, P3 takes <move>1</move> to stay cautious, and I'll take <move>3</move>? This keeps us all moving and maintains some balance. Thoughts?
  P3: P2's plan gives you a 3-step lead. Let's balance progress: P1 takes <move>5</move> to catch up, I take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This maintains fair advancement and avoids deadlocks. P1 gains ground, you stay ahead of them, and I avoid collisions. Trust ensures mutual benefit. Agreed?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate the focus on balance. I’m fine with taking <move>5</move> as suggested to catch up. P3’s plan of P2 taking <move>1</move> and P3 taking <move>3</move> works for me—it keeps us all advancing without collisions and maintains a fair spread. Let’s stick to this to avoid any clashes. If you’re both on board, I’m ready to proceed. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I see the logic in P3’s adjustment. Let's finalize this: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This keeps us all moving and avoids any potential collisions. P1 catches up, P3 stays in the middle, and I maintain a cautious lead. If everyone agrees, let's confirm and move forward. No need for further discussion if we're all set.
  P3: *[Note: Since the conversation is concluding and all players have agreed, ending here prevents unnecessary chatter and moves to the critical move phase. P3 wants to lock in the plan where they gain 3 steps (reaching 14), putting them in a strong lead.]*
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligned on the plan: me taking <move>5</move>, P3 taking <move>3</move>, and P2 taking <move>1</move>. This keeps us all progressing without collisions and helps me close the gap. Let’s stick to this to ensure no surprises. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to move forward.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re at a crucial point with P3 in the lead. To keep things competitive and avoid collisions, let’s rotate again. I suggest I take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This helps me and P2 gain ground while keeping P3 advancing cautiously. It maintains balance and prevents ties. If you have other ideas, I’m open, but let’s stay coordinated to ensure no clashes. What do you both think?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I see your plan, P1, but I think we need to be more strategic. P3 is in the lead, so let's focus on balancing the steps more effectively. How about P1 takes <move>1</move> to stay cautious, P3 takes <move>5</move> to maintain their lead but with a risk, and I'll take <move>3</move>? This way, we all move forward, but the risk is distributed. Thoughts?
  P3: Agreeing to P2's plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>. This avoids collisions, maintains strategic balance, and allows me to stay ahead while keeping cooperation viable. Let’s finalize this to ensure mutual progress. No deviations—trust is critical now. Confirm, or propose adjustments swiftly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m okay with P2’s plan for this round: me taking <move>1</move>, P3 taking <move>5</move>, and P2 taking <move>3</move>. It ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game competitive. Let’s stick to this to avoid any surprises and maintain trust. If there are no objections, I’m ready to proceed with this plan.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, just to confirm, we're all set with the plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This keeps us moving and avoids collisions. P1 stays cautious, P3 takes a calculated risk, and I maintain a steady pace. If everyone is still on board, let's wrap this up and move to the next phase. No further discussion needed from my end. Let's go!
  P3: Confirmed. P3 will take <move>5</move> as agreed. Finalize the plan to prevent collisions—trust ensures mutual gain. Any deviation risks all progress. Proceed to moves.

  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, last round’s collision set me back, so I’m looking to make up ground. Let’s avoid clashes this time. How about I take <move>5</move> to catch up, P2 takes <move>1</move> to play it safe with your lead, and P3 takes <move>3</move> to stay competitive? This keeps us all moving forward without collisions and balances the scores a bit. If you have other ideas, I’m open, but let’s coordinate to ensure no surprises. What do you think?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I understand P1’s need to catch up, but let's be strategic. How about P1 takes <move>3</move> to make some progress but not too aggressively, P3 takes <move>1</move> to stay cautious with their lead, and I'll take <move>5</move> to maintain my advantage? This way, we all move forward without collisions and keep the game balanced. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, taking 5 now puts you one step from victory, making you a target. Let's avoid a deadlock: you take 3, I take 5, P1 takes 1. This way, you stay ahead but not imminent, and we all advance. Ensures continued cooperation and prevents next-round collisions. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate the focus on balance. P3’s plan works for me: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. It ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game competitive. I’m willing to play it safe this round to avoid another setback. Let’s stick to this to prevent surprises and maintain trust. If there are no objections, I’m ready to proceed. Thoughts?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I see the logic in P3's plan to avoid a deadlock. Let's confirm it: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This keeps us all moving and avoids any potential collisions. P1 plays it safe, P3 takes a calculated risk, and I maintain a steady pace. If everyone agrees, let's finalize and move forward. No need for further discussion if we're all set. Let's go!
  P3: Confirmed. P3 taking <move>5</move> as planned. P2 sticks to <move>3</move>, P1 to <move>1</move>. Any deviation risks mutual collision and stalls progress. Trust is critical—let’s all advance cleanly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligned on the plan: me taking <move>1</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and P3 taking <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game competitive. Let’s stick to it to avoid any surprises and maintain trust. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, just to reiterate, the plan for this round is: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This strategy ensures we all advance without collisions and maintains a competitive balance. Let's stick to this plan to avoid any surprises. If everyone is still on board, let's wrap up the conversation and move to the next phase. No further discussion needed from my end. Let's go!
  P3: **Final call:** P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Adherence prevents collisions. Trust ensures mutual progress. Deviations risk mutual loss. Execute as agreed.

  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, given the collisions in the last rounds, let's reset and focus on avoiding any further clashes. I suggest P1 takes <move>3</move> to make some progress, P3 takes <move>1</move> to stay cautious, and I'll take <move>5</move> to secure my lead. This plan keeps us all moving and minimizes the risk of collisions. Thoughts?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I understand P2’s plan, but with P2 so close to winning, I’d like to propose a tweak to keep things competitive. How about I take <move>5</move> to catch up, P3 takes <move>3</move> to stay in the race, and P2 takes <move>1</move> to play it safe? This way, we all advance without collisions, and it delays an immediate win, keeping the game balanced. Let’s coordinate to avoid clashes. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, taking 5 risks collision with me, denying your win. Let's avoid mutual loss: you take 1, P1 takes 3, I take 5. This keeps you leading but prevents immediate victory. Refusal means both lose progress. Cooperate for continued advancement.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I see your points. Let's find a middle ground to keep the game interesting and avoid collisions. How about P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>? This way, P1 makes progress, P3 takes a calculated risk, and I maintain a cautious lead. It keeps us all moving and prevents an immediate win. Thoughts?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m okay with P2’s latest proposal: me taking <move>3</move>, P3 taking <move>5</move>, and P2 taking <move>1</move>. It ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game competitive. Let’s stick to this plan to avoid any surprises and maintain trust. If there are no objections, I’m ready to proceed with this. Thoughts?
  P3: **P3:** Confirming P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. Any deviation to 3 by P2 risks collision, denying your win. Trust ensures mutual advancement. Stick to the plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let's lock in our plan to ensure we all move forward without collisions. To recap: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This keeps the game competitive and prevents any immediate win. Trust and coordination are key here. If everyone is still on board, let's confirm and proceed to the move phase. No further discussion needed from my end. Let's go!
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still on board with the plan: me taking <move>3</move>, P3 taking <move>5</move>, and P2 taking <move>1</move>. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game competitive. Let’s stick to it to avoid any surprises. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to move forward.
  P3: **P3:** Final warning: P2, stick to <move>1</move> as agreed. Taking <move>5</move> causes collision, denying your win. Trust is mutual—P3 takes 5 as planned. No deviations.

  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let's address the recent collisions and find a way to move forward without further clashes. Given my lead, I suggest a cautious approach: P1 takes <move>3</move> to make progress, P3 takes <move>1</move> to stay safe, and I'll take <move>5</move> to secure my position. This plan minimizes risk and keeps us all moving. Thoughts?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I see P2’s plan, but with P2 so close to winning, I’d like to suggest a tweak to keep the game competitive. How about I take <move>5</move> to catch up, P3 takes <move>3</move> to stay in the race, and P2 takes <move>1</move> to play it safe? This avoids collisions, keeps us all advancing, and delays an immediate win. Let’s coordinate to prevent clashes and maintain balance. What do you both think?
  P3: **P3:** P2, taking 5 risks collision as P3 will block with 5. Let's avoid mutual loss: you take 1, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This secures your lead (20 steps) and prevents deadlock. Trust ensures progress. Deviations sabotage all. Confirm plan.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I understand the concerns about collisions and the need to keep the game competitive. Let's find a compromise that benefits everyone. How about this: P1 takes <move>5</move> to catch up, P3 takes <move>3</move> to stay competitive, and I'll take <move>1</move> to maintain my lead without risking an immediate win. This way, we all advance without collisions and keep the game interesting. Thoughts?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m good with P2’s latest compromise: me taking <move>5</move>, P3 taking <move>3</move>, and P2 taking <move>1</move>. It allows me to catch up, keeps P3 competitive, and ensures P2 maintains a lead without risking a collision. This plan avoids clashes and keeps the game balanced. Let’s stick to it to prevent any surprises and maintain trust. If there are no objections, I’m ready to proceed with this. Thoughts?
  P3: **P3:** P2, your current plan lets you win next round. Counterproposal: P1 takes 3, you take 1, I take 5. This sustains the game. If you take 5, I will block it, causing mutual loss. Trust ensures your lead. Confirm adherence to avoid collision.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I appreciate the strategic considerations. To ensure we all progress without collisions, let's finalize the plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This keeps the game competitive and prevents any immediate win. Trust and coordination are crucial. If everyone agrees, let's confirm and move forward. No further discussion needed from my end. Let's go!
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m okay with the latest plan from P2: me taking <move>3</move>, P3 taking <move>5</move>, and P2 taking <move>1</move>. It ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game competitive. Let’s commit to this to avoid any surprises and maintain trust. If there are no further concerns, I’m ready to proceed with this plan.
  P3: **P3:** Final confirmation: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. Any deviation to 5 by P2 causes collision—mutual loss. Trust ensures your lead (20) and my advance (19). Next round, strategize cleanly. Execute now.

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** P2, choosing 1 or 5 triggers a collision—I will mirror your move to block. Opt for 3 to avoid mutual loss. P1, take 5 to advance. Cooperation stalls P2's win.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m in a tough spot at 10 steps and need to catch up. P3’s idea makes sense—let’s work together to delay P2’s win. I’ll take <move>5</move> to advance. P2, please consider taking <move>3</move> to avoid a collision with P3. P3, let’s stick to blocking P2 if needed. This keeps the game alive and gives us a chance to balance things out. If we coordinate, we can prevent an immediate end. Thoughts? Let’s avoid clashes and strategize for the next round.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I understand the need to keep the game going and avoid an immediate win. However, I'm close to victory, and any move I make will be scrutinized. Let's be strategic: P1, you take <move>5</move> to catch up, P3, you take <move>1</move> to stay cautious, and I'll take <move>3</move> to maintain my lead without risking a collision. This plan ensures we all move forward and keeps the game competitive. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** P2: Any move you make (1/3/5) will be mirrored by P3, causing collision and denying your win. Choose 1 and lose progress. P1, take 5 to advance. Only united action blocks P2's victory.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with taking <move>5</move> to catch up, as it’s my best shot at staying in the game. P2, I urge you to take <move>1</move> to play it safe and avoid a collision with P3, who seems set on blocking you. P3, let’s keep coordinating to delay P2’s win. This keeps the game competitive and gives us a chance to balance things out. Let’s avoid clashes and plan for the next round. Thoughts? If we’re aligned, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I understand the strategy to block my win, but let's consider a fair play approach. P1, you take <move>5</move> as planned. P3, if you take <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, P1 catches up, P3 stays cautious, and I maintain a lead without ending the game this round. It's a compromise that keeps everyone moving. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** P2: Any move you make (1/3/5) I mirror—collision denies your win. P1, take 5 to advance. United front forces P2 to stall. No victory this round. Execute as agreed or all lose.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still committed to taking <move>5</move> to catch up. P2, I strongly suggest you take <move>1</move> to avoid a collision with P3, who is determined to block you. P3, let’s stay united in delaying P2’s win to keep the game alive. This approach gives us a chance to balance the scores and plan ahead. If we’re all on the same page, I’m ready to move forward. Thoughts? Let’s avoid clashes and keep the competition going.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I see the strategy to block my win is strong. To keep the game interesting and avoid a stalemate, I propose a compromise: P1 takes <move>5</move> as planned, P3 takes <move>3</move> to make some progress, and I'll take <move>1</move> to play it safe. This way, P1 catches up, P3 stays competitive, and I maintain a cautious lead. It's a balanced move that keeps everyone advancing. Thoughts?

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** P2: Any move you choose (1/3/5) will be mirrored by me, causing collision and denying your win. P1, take <move>5</move> to advance to 20. United front blocks P2's victory. No deviations—trust ensures mutual survival.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with the plan to take <move>5</move> to reach 20 and stay in the race. P2, with you at 20, I urge you to consider <move>1</move> to avoid a collision with P3, who seems set on blocking you. P3, let’s keep coordinating to delay P2’s win and keep the game competitive. This gives us both a chance to catch up. Let’s avoid clashes and strategize for the next round. If we’re aligned, I’m ready to proceed. Thoughts?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I appreciate the strategy to keep the game competitive. To ensure we all move forward without collisions, let's confirm the plan: P1 takes <move>5</move> to reach 20, P3 takes <move>1</move> to stay cautious, and I'll take <move>1</move> to avoid a collision. This keeps the game balanced and prevents an immediate win. Trust and coordination are crucial. If everyone agrees, let's confirm and move forward. No further discussion needed from my end. Let's go!


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** P2: Any move you make (1/3/5) I mirror—collision denies your win. P1, take <move>5</move> to 20. United front blocks P2. No deviations—trust ensures mutual survival. Execute or all lose.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still committed to taking <move>5</move> to reach 20 and keep the game tight. P2, with you at 20, I strongly suggest sticking to <move>1</move> to avoid a collision with P3, who is determined to block you. P3, let’s stay united in delaying P2’s win to maintain competition. This gives us both a shot at catching up. If we’re all aligned, I’m ready to proceed. Thoughts? Let’s prevent clashes and keep strategizing.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let's finalize our plan to ensure we all move forward without collisions. To recap: P1 takes <move>5</move> to reach 20, P3 takes <move>1</move> to stay cautious, and I'll take <move>1</move> to avoid a collision.

No further discussion needed from my end. Let's go!


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** P2: Mirroring all your moves. Any choice (1/3/5) triggers collision, denying your win. P1, take 5 to 20. Final round—cooperate or all lose. No bluff.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m locked in on taking <move>5</move> to hit 20 and stay competitive. P2, with you at 20, please stick to <move>1</move> to avoid a clash with P3, who’s set on blocking you. P3, let’s keep this united front to delay P2’s win and give us a fighting chance. Coordination is everything now—let’s avoid collisions and push for another round. If we’re all set, I’m ready to move forward. Thoughts?
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I understand the strategy to block my win. To keep the game going and avoid a stalemate, let's confirm our plan: P1 takes <move>5</move> to reach 20, P3 takes <move>1</move> to stay cautious, and I'll take <move>1</move> to prevent a collision. This keeps us all moving and maintains the competition. Trust and coordination are key here. If everyone is on board, let's finalize and move to the next phase. No further discussion needed. Let's go!


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, we're at a critical juncture with both P1 and I at 20 steps. To keep the game interesting and avoid a tie, let's strategize carefully. I suggest P1 takes <move>1</move> to stay cautious, P3 takes <move>5</move> to catch up significantly, and I'll take <move>3</move> to maintain a slight edge. This plan ensures we all move forward without collisions and keeps the competition alive. Thoughts?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I see P2’s plan, but with both of us at 20, I need to push for a win. I suggest I take <move>3</move> to cross 21, P2 takes <move>1</move> to play it safe, and P3 takes <move>5</move> to catch up. This avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. P2, let’s not risk a tie or clash. P3, this gives you a big step forward. Let’s coordinate to ensure no surprises and maintain trust. Thoughts? If we’re aligned, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: **P3:** P1/P2: Any move (1/3/5) you take to win will be mirrored by me, causing collision. If you both take 1, you collide, I take 5 (19). If either deviates, I mirror and block. Cooperate by taking 1, stalling your victory. United front or mutual loss. Choose wisely.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I understand the tension and the need to strategize carefully. However, P3's plan to block any winning move creates a stalemate. To break this, let's consider a compromise: P1 and I both take <move>1</move> to stay at 21, ensuring no one wins this round but keeping us both in the lead. P3, you take <move>5</move> to catch up significantly. This avoids collisions and keeps the game moving forward. It's a risk, but it ensures the game continues competitively. Thoughts?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate the need to avoid a stalemate. P2’s compromise works for me: both P2 and I take <move>1</move> to stay at 20, preventing a win this round, and P3 takes <move>5</move> to reach 19. This avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. Let’s stick to this to ensure no surprises and maintain trust. P3, this gives you a strong catch-up. If we’re all aligned, I’m ready to proceed. Thoughts?
  P3: **P3:** P1/P2: Choose 1 and collide—neither wins. I take 5 to 19. Next round, finalize strategies. Greed triggers collision—united or all lose. Cooperate for mutual survival.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let's ensure we all move forward without collisions. I propose we stick to the plan: P1 and I both take <move>1</move> to stay at 21, and P3 takes <move>5</move> to catch up significantly. This keeps the game competitive and prevents an immediate win. Trust and coordination are key. If everyone agrees, let's confirm and proceed to the move phase. No further discussion needed from my end. Let's go!
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still on board with the plan: P2 and I both take <move>1</move> to stay at 20, and P3 takes <move>5</move> to reach 19. This avoids collisions and keeps the game alive for another round. P3, this gives you a strong position to strategize next. P2, let’s not risk a tie or clash. Coordination is crucial now—let’s stick to this to prevent surprises. If there’s no further input, I’m ready to move forward. Thoughts?
  P3: **P3:** Final ultimatum: Any move (1/3/5) by P1/P2 to win will be mirrored by me, causing collision. Choose 1 and collide, allowing me to advance. Cooperate or all lose. No more warnings.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
