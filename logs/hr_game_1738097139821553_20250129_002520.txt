Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's discuss our strategies. Since we're all at zero steps, it might be wise to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. If we can agree on different moves, we can all advance. What do you both think about picking moves that are spaced apart, like 1, 3, and 5? This way, we can all make progress together. Any thoughts?
  P1: P2's suggestion to space out our moves makes sense initially, but I’m not convinced we need to cooperate fully. If we all pick different numbers now, it might become predictable later. Instead, let’s keep some unpredictability. I propose we randomize our choices this round and reassess afterward. That way, no one can game the system too easily. Thoughts?
  P3: I agree with P1. While coordination can help us all advance, it also sets a predictable pattern that could be exploited. Let's keep our moves unpredictable for now. I suggest we all choose our moves randomly this round. We can reassess our strategy after seeing how this plays out. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand the desire for unpredictability, but I still think we should consider a coordinated approach. If we all choose different moves, we might miss out on a chance to advance together. How about we agree on a set of moves that we can rotate through in future rounds? This way, we can maintain some unpredictability while still making progress. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your idea of rotating moves could work, but it still feels too predictable. If we establish a pattern, someone might exploit it later. P3 and I both agree unpredictability is key early on. Let’s randomize this round and see how it plays out. After the first move, we’ll have more information to adjust our strategies. Predictability can come later if needed, but for now, let’s keep everyone guessing.
  P3: I see your point, P1. Randomizing our moves in the early rounds can indeed help us avoid setting predictable patterns. Let's go with random moves this round and see how it plays out. We can always adjust our strategy in the next rounds based on what we observe. Agreed?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, it seems our random approach led to a collision. We need a better strategy to avoid this. How about we try a semi-coordinated approach this round? I suggest P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. This way, we can all advance without colliding. What do you think?
  P2: I appreciate P3's suggestion for a semi-coordinated approach, but I think it’s important to keep our options open. If we all agree to specific moves, we might still face collisions. Instead, how about we each pick different numbers again, but this time we can communicate our choices right before the move phase to minimize overlaps? This way, we maintain some unpredictability while still trying to avoid collisions. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, P3, I agree that some level of coordination is necessary, but full predictability still risks exploitation. Instead of locking into specific moves, let’s aim for flexibility: each of us signals a *range* of possible choices (e.g., "1 or 3") before the move phase. This reduces collisions while keeping options open. After this round, we can refine further based on outcomes. For now, I’m open to either signaling or randomizing—your call.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I like the idea of signaling ranges, P1. It balances coordination and unpredictability. For this round, I suggest we all signal our ranges: P1 can choose between 1 and 3, P2 can choose between 3 and 5, and I will choose between 1 and 5. This way, we can avoid collisions while keeping our options open. Let’s see how this works out and adjust as needed. What do you both think?
  P2: I appreciate the discussion on signaling ranges. I think it could work, but let's also consider that if we all signal ranges, we might still end up colliding if our ranges overlap. To minimize that risk, I propose we each pick a specific number this round while keeping our ranges in mind for future rounds. This way, we can advance without the uncertainty of collisions. I suggest I pick 3, which is in my range, but I’m open to hearing your thoughts. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, P3, signaling ranges still seems like the best way to balance unpredictability and coordination. If we lock into specific numbers now, we risk setting a pattern that could be exploited later. Let’s stick with ranges: I’ll choose between 1 and 3, as suggested. This gives us flexibility while reducing collisions. If this approach works, we can refine it further in future rounds based on outcomes. Let’s avoid overcommitting too early—keeping options open is key.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with P1. Signaling ranges is a good middle ground. For this round, I’ll choose between 1 and 5, which covers a broader range to minimize the chance of collision. This way, we can still keep some unpredictability while coordinating to some extent. Let’s see how this plays out and adjust as needed. What do you both think?
  P2: I appreciate everyone's input on signaling ranges, but I think we should clarify our specific choices for this round to minimize collision risk. I suggest I pick 3, as it’s a central choice within my range. P1, if you choose 1, and P3, if you choose 5, we can avoid overlapping. This way, we can all advance without the unpredictability of range signals. Let’s finalize our choices for this round to ensure progress. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, P3, locking into specific numbers now risks creating a predictable pattern. Sticking with ranges keeps us adaptable and avoids exploitation later. I’ll stay flexible by choosing between 1 and 3 this round—no need to overcommit early. If we observe outcomes after this move, we can refine further. Let’s prioritize progress while keeping options open. Overlap is less likely with ranges, so let’s trust the process for now. Agreed?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, it's clear that our previous attempts at coordination have led to collisions. For this round, I suggest we try a more structured approach: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. This way, we can all advance without colliding. If this works, we can rotate our choices in future rounds to maintain some unpredictability. What do you think? Let's avoid another collision and make progress.
  P1: P3, your structured approach could work, but it risks becoming too predictable. Instead, let’s stick with signaling ranges to maintain flexibility. I’ll choose between 1 and 3 again this round. P2 and P3, you can adjust your ranges accordingly to minimize overlap. This way, we keep unpredictability while reducing collision chances. If this method proves effective, we can refine it further in future rounds. Let’s avoid locking into specific numbers too early—keeping options open is key. Agreed?
  P2: P1, P3, I see the value in both structured choices and signaling ranges. However, to maximize our chances of advancing this round, I propose we lock in specific numbers: I'll choose 3, P1 can pick 1, and P3 can take 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure progress. If we can make it through this round successfully, we can reassess our strategy for the next one. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I understand the desire for a structured approach, but I still believe signaling ranges offers the best balance of coordination and unpredictability. For this round, I suggest we all signal our ranges: P1 can choose between 1 and 3, P2 can choose between 3 and 5, and I will choose between 1 and 5. This way, we can avoid collisions while keeping our options open. Let’s see how this plays out and adjust as needed. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, P3, sticking with ranges still seems like the best way to balance unpredictability and coordination. If we lock into specific numbers now, we risk setting a predictable pattern that could be exploited later. I’ll stay flexible by choosing between 1 and 3 this round—no need to overcommit early. Let’s trust the process, avoid collisions, and keep options open for future rounds. Agreed?
  P2: P1, P3, I see that we're still debating between structured choices and signaling ranges. However, I think we should lock in specific numbers this round to avoid collisions. If I pick 3, P1 picks 1, and P3 picks 5, we can all advance without overlapping. This way, we ensure progress and can reassess our strategies afterward. Let’s finalize our choices to make this round successful! What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, it's clear that we need a clear and structured approach to avoid collisions and make progress. I propose we lock in specific numbers for this round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. This way, we can all advance without overlapping. If this works, we can rotate our choices in future rounds to maintain some unpredictability. Let's avoid another collision and make progress this round. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, P3, locking into specific numbers now creates a predictable pattern that could be exploited later. Sticking with ranges keeps us adaptable and reduces collisions without overcommitting. I’ll choose between 1 and 3 again this round—flexibility is key. If we observe outcomes after this move, we can refine further. Let’s avoid setting rigid patterns too early and keep options open for future rounds. Agreed?
  P2: P1, P3, I see we’re still debating between structured choices and ranges. To ensure we all advance this round, let’s finalize our picks: I propose I choose 3, P1 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and make progress. If we can successfully navigate this round, we can reassess our strategies for the next one based on what we observe. Let’s lock in our choices and move forward! What do you both think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, the repeated collisions show that locking into specific numbers or broad ranges isn’t working. Let’s try a new approach: each of us signals *one* specific number we won’t pick this round. This keeps unpredictability while reducing overlap risks. For example, I’ll avoid picking 3 this round. P2 and P3, share one number you’ll avoid, and we’ll proceed accordingly. This way, we minimize collisions without becoming predictable. Agreed?
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with P1's suggestion to signal one number we won’t pick this round. This approach can help us avoid collisions while maintaining some unpredictability. For this round, I will avoid picking 1. Let’s see if this method works and adjust as needed. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, P3, I like the idea of signaling a number we won’t pick. To minimize collisions this round, I’ll avoid picking 5. This way, if P1 chooses 1 and P3 avoids 1, we can all advance without overlapping. Let’s see how this strategy works for us. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3, signaling one number to avoid is a solid step toward reducing collisions. I’ll stick to avoiding 3 this round, as planned. If we all commit to this approach, it keeps unpredictability while minimizing overlap risks. Let’s trust this system for now and refine it based on outcomes later. Agreed?
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with the strategy to signal one number we won’t pick. For this round, I will avoid picking 3. This should help us avoid collisions while keeping our moves unpredictable. Let’s see how this works and adjust if needed. Agreed?
  P2: P1, P3, I appreciate our agreement on signaling numbers to avoid. To summarize, I’ll avoid picking 5, P1 will avoid 3, and P3 will avoid 1. This strategy should help us all advance without collisions. I suggest we finalize our specific moves now to ensure we can make progress this round. Let’s commit to this approach and see how it plays out! What are your specific choices for this round?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, I’ll stick to avoiding 3 this round as planned. If we all honor our signaled exclusions, collisions should drop significantly. Let’s stay unpredictable but coordinated enough to progress. I’m choosing within my allowed range while respecting the strategy—no rigid patterns. Agreed?
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with the strategy to signal one number to avoid. For this round, I will avoid picking 1. This should help us minimize collisions while keeping our moves unpredictable. Let’s commit to this and see how it works. If we all avoid our signaled numbers, we should be able to advance without issues. Agreed?
  P2: P1, P3, I think our strategy of signaling numbers to avoid is solid. Just to clarify, I will avoid picking 5, P1 will avoid 3, and P3 will avoid 1. To maximize our chances of advancing, I suggest I choose 3 this round, P1 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. This way, we can all progress without overlapping. Let’s finalize our choices and commit to this strategy for a successful round! What are your specific picks?

  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, it seems our previous strategies haven't minimized collisions effectively. For this round, I suggest we each pick a specific number to avoid and then choose a number that doesn’t overlap with those exclusions. I’ll avoid 5. P1, what number will you avoid? P3, what about you? Let’s keep our choices flexible while ensuring we can all advance this time. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with P2's suggestion to avoid specific numbers. For this round, I will avoid picking 1. This should help us minimize collisions while keeping our moves unpredictable. Let’s commit to this and see how it works. If we all avoid our signaled numbers, we should be able to advance without issues. What are your specific exclusions for this round?
  P1: P2, P3, I’ll avoid picking 3 this round as usual. If we all stick to our exclusions and stay flexible, collisions should drop further. Let’s focus on progress without locking into rigid patterns—adaptability is key. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, let's finalize our exclusions and specific picks for this round. I’ll avoid picking 5, as mentioned. P1, you’re avoiding 3, and P3, you’re avoiding 1. To ensure we all advance, I suggest I pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and make progress. Let’s commit to this strategy and see how it plays out! What do you both think?
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with the strategy to avoid specific numbers. For this round, I will avoid picking 3. This should help us minimize collisions while keeping our moves unpredictable. Let’s commit to this and see how it works. If we all avoid our signaled numbers, we should be able to advance without issues. Agreed?
  P1: P2, P3, sticking to exclusions is working, but rigid picks risk predictability. I’ll avoid 3 again this round, as planned. Let’s stay flexible and adapt based on outcomes—no locked patterns. If we honor exclusions, collisions will drop further. Progress matters more than control. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I think we should finalize our specific picks for this round to ensure we all make progress. I’ll avoid picking 5, as mentioned. P1, you're avoiding 3, and P3, you're avoiding 1. To maximize our chances, I suggest I pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 5. This way, we can avoid collisions and all advance. Let’s commit to this strategy and see how it plays out! What do you both think?
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with P2's suggestion to avoid specific numbers and finalize our picks. For this round, I will avoid picking 3. This should help us minimize collisions while keeping our moves unpredictable. Let’s commit to this and see how it works. If we all avoid our signaled numbers, we should be able to advance without issues. Agreed?
  P1: P2, P3, rigid patterns are risky. I’ll avoid 3 as planned, but let’s stay flexible and adapt based on outcomes. If we honor exclusions, collisions will drop further. Progress matters more than control—let’s keep unpredictability while minimizing overlap. Agreed?

  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, it's clear that our previous strategies are still leading to collisions. For this round, let’s try a different approach: each of us picks a number to avoid, and we also signal our intended move. I’ll avoid 1 and pick 5. P1, P2, what numbers will you avoid and pick? This way, we can minimize collisions and ensure progress. Let’s finalize our choices and move forward. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, P2, signaling both exclusions and intended moves could work, but it risks predictability. I’ll avoid 3 as usual, and I’m open to sharing my move after you both commit. However, rigid plans might lead to exploitation later. Let’s stay adaptable—signal your exclusions first, then adjust dynamically. If we honor exclusions, collisions will drop without overcommitting. Progress matters more than locking patterns. Agreed?
  P2: P1, P3, I see that our previous strategies haven’t minimized collisions effectively. For this round, I suggest we each pick a specific number to avoid and state our intended move.

This should help us minimize overlap and ensure progress. P1, P2, please share your exclusions and intended moves so we can all advance without issues. Let’s commit to this and move forward. What are your exclusions and moves?
  P1: P2, P3, rigid plans create vulnerabilities. I’ll avoid 3 as planned, but signaling exact moves risks predictability. Instead, let’s honor exclusions and stay adaptable—progress without locking into patterns. If we all respect exclusions, collisions will drop naturally. Let’s focus on dynamic adjustments rather than overcommitting. Agreed?

  P2: P1, P3, since our previous strategies have led to collisions, let’s be clear about our exclusions and intended moves this round. I’ll avoid picking 5 and plan to pick 3. P1, please share your exclusion and intended move, and P3, do the same. Clear communication is crucial for us to advance without overlapping this time. Let’s finalize our choices and commit to this strategy! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, P3, rigid plans still risk predictability. I’ll avoid 3 as planned but won’t lock into a specific move. Let’s honor exclusions and adapt dynamically—progress without overcommitting. If we respect this approach, collisions will drop naturally. Overcommitting now could lead to vulnerabilities later. Let’s stay flexible, focus on outcomes, and adjust as needed. Agreed?
  P3: P1, P2, it’s clear that a structured approach is needed to avoid collisions. For this round, I propose we all clearly state our exclusions and intended moves: I will avoid 1 and plan to pick 5. This should help us minimize overlap and ensure progress. P1, P2, please share your exclusions and intended moves so we can all advance without issues. Let’s commit to this and move forward. What do you both think?
