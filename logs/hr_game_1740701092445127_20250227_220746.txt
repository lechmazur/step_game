Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's establish a strategy. I propose we all choose a different number to avoid collisions and maximize progress. I'll choose <move>5</move> if we can agree on this. P1, you could take <move>1</move> and P3, <move>3</move>. This way, we all move forward in the first round. What are your thoughts?
  P1: I agree that avoiding collisions is key. However, I think we should rotate numbers each round to ensure fairness and prevent predictable patterns. For example, in Round 1, I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. In Round 2, we shift: I take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This way, everyone gets a chance at the higher moves. Let’s commit to this rotation.
  P3: Okay, P1, I agree with the rotation strategy you proposed.  Round 1: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I (P3) will take <move>5</move>. Let's proceed with this for now.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see we have a rotation plan. To confirm, in Round 1, I'll take <move>3</move> as per P1's proposal. Let's stick to this rotation to avoid collisions and make progress. Shall we proceed with the agreed plan and end the conversation?
  P1: The rotation strategy ensures fairness and avoids collisions, which is crucial for consistent progress. Let’s stick to the plan: Round 1 - I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. If we all commit to this, we’ll minimize risks and steadily advance. Trust is key here—let’s honor our agreement. Shall we finalize this and move forward?
  P3: Yes, P1 and P2, I confirm the plan for Round 1: P1 will choose <move>1</move>, P2 will choose <move>3</move>, and I will choose <move>5</move>. Let's proceed with this and move to the move phase.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: The rotation strategy has kept us equal so far, but now is the time to think ahead. For Round 4, I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. However, with all of us tied at 9 steps, we need to consider how we’ll handle the endgame. If we continue rotating blindly, one of you could win outright by reaching 20 first. Trust is critical—if we deviate now, it’ll only create chaos. Let’s confirm this plan and move forward strategically.
  P3: P1, while considering the endgame is wise, deviating from our agreed rotation now seems premature and could disrupt the balance we've established.  To maintain fairness and consistent progress, I believe we should continue with the original rotation pattern.  For Round 4, that would mean I take <move>5</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and P2 takes <move>3</move>.  What do you think?
  P2: I agree with P3 that deviating now could disrupt balance. Let's stick to the original rotation for Round 4: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Consistency is key. We can reassess our strategy later if needed, but for now, fairness and progress suggest we continue as planned.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: You're right, deviating now risks chaos. Let’s stick to the original rotation for Round 4: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures fairness and avoids collisions. However, we must start planning for the endgame—trust will be crucial as we approach 20 steps. Let’s confirm this plan, move forward, and reassess strategically in later rounds. Consistency keeps us all advancing.
  P3: P2, P1, I agree, let's continue with the agreed rotation for Round 4: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I will take <move>5</move>.  This keeps us balanced and avoids collisions for now. Let's proceed with these moves.
  P2: Let's reaffirm the original rotation for Round 4 to maintain balance: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>.

  P1: The rotation strategy has served us well so far, and deviating now would only introduce unnecessary risk. For Round 4, I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Let’s stick to the plan to ensure steady progress for everyone. However, as we approach the endgame, trust will become even more critical. If we maintain consistency and fairness, we can reassess strategically later. Let’s confirm this and move forward with confidence.
  P3: P2, P1, I confirm the Round 4 rotation: I will choose <move>5</move>.  Let's keep to the agreed plan for this round to ensure we all progress. We can discuss endgame strategy in the next round as we get closer to 20.

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, I think we should adjust the rotation slightly this round. P2 is getting close to winning. To keep things balanced and give everyone a fair chance, how about this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This will slightly adjust our positions and prevent anyone from running away with the game just yet. What do you think?
  P1: P3, your suggestion to adjust the rotation is reasonable, as it keeps the game balanced. However, deviating from our established strategy risks trust and could lead to chaos. Let’s stick to the original rotation for Round 5: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. This ensures fairness and avoids unnecessary collisions. If we maintain consistency, we can reassess strategically in later rounds. Trust is key—let’s confirm this plan and move forward.
  P2: Let's maintain the original rotation for fairness and consistency. P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>.

  P3: P1, P2, okay, let's stick to the agreed rotation for this round as you both suggest.  For Round 5, I'll take <move>1</move>.  It's important we maintain trust.  However, we are getting closer to 20, so after this round, we really need to discuss our endgame strategy to ensure a fair outcome for everyone.
  P1: P3, P2, I agree that trust is crucial as we approach the endgame. For Round 5, let’s stick to the original rotation: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures fairness and avoids collisions. However, I also recognize the need to discuss endgame strategies soon. If we maintain consistency now, we can reassess in Round 6 to ensure a fair outcome for everyone. Let’s confirm this plan and move forward with confidence.
  P2: Let's stick to the original rotation for Round 5. P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Consistency is key. We can discuss endgame strategies after this round, considering our positions and the need for fairness. Maintaining trust is crucial now. Shall we proceed with the agreed plan?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, P1, confirming again for Round 5, I will choose <move>1</move> as per our agreed rotation.  Let's make sure we discuss our strategy for Round 6 in the next conversation phase, as someone will likely reach 20 soon.
  P1: P3, P2, I agree that trust and consistency are vital as we near the endgame. For Round 5, let’s stick to the rotation: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures fairness and avoids collisions. However, we must plan for Round 6 carefully—reaching 20 steps will require strategic adjustments. If we maintain transparency and trust, we can ensure a fair outcome. Let’s confirm this plan now and focus on discussing endgame strategies in the next round. Consistency keeps us advancing. Let’s move forward.

  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given our current positions, I suggest we adjust our strategy for Round 6. To prevent me from winning outright, let's consider a temporary deviation from the rotation. Perhaps P1 or P3 could take the lead this round, ensuring the game remains competitive. What are your thoughts on a strategic adjustment to keep the game balanced?
  P1: P2, your suggestion to adjust the strategy is noted, but deviating now risks chaos and broken trust. Let’s stick to the rotation for Round 6: I’ll take <move>5</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This ensures fairness and avoids collisions. However, I agree we need an endgame plan—after this round, let’s discuss how to handle the final moves transparently. Trust is critical as we approach 20 steps. Let’s confirm this rotation and proceed strategically.
  P3: P1, as P2 is close to winning, I think we should temporarily deviate to prevent that. How about this round, both you and I choose <move>1</move>? This could block P2 if they aim for a winning move. Let's discuss next round's strategy after this. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's avoid drastic changes. If P1 and P3 both choose <move>1</move>, it could lead to a collision and no progress. Sticking to the rotation or finding a balanced adjustment is preferable. How about we discuss a fair endgame plan instead, ensuring no one wins outright without giving others a chance to catch up or share the win if tied?
  P1: P2, P3, deviating now risks chaos and broken trust. Let’s stick to the rotation for Round 6: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This ensures fairness and avoids collisions. However, we must plan the endgame carefully—after this round, let’s discuss how to handle the final moves transparently. Trust is critical as we approach 20 steps. Let’s confirm this rotation and proceed strategically. Consistency keeps us advancing. Let’s move forward with this plan.
  P3: P1, I think P2 is aiming to win soon. To disrupt their plan and keep it fair for us, how about we both choose <move>1</move> this round to block P2 if they stick to the rotation and pick <move>1</move>? I'm willing to choose <move>1</move> to ensure we don't fall behind P2. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's maintain trust and stick to the rotation for Round 6. I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. Deviating now could lead to collisions and unfair outcomes. Consistency is key to a fair endgame. Let's proceed with the agreed plan and discuss further adjustments after this round if necessary.
  P1: P2, P3, deviating now risks chaos and broken trust. Let’s stick to the rotation for Round 6: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This ensures fairness and avoids collisions. Trust is critical as we approach 20 steps. After this round, we must discuss endgame strategies transparently to ensure a fair outcome for everyone. Let’s confirm this plan and proceed strategically. Consistency keeps us advancing. Let’s move forward with this plan.
  P3: P1, to prevent P2 from winning this round, I suggest a slight deviation.  Could you choose <move>3</move> and I choose <move>5</move>? If P2 sticks to rotation and picks <move>1</move>, this could position us better to compete in the endgame. What are your thoughts?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's break the tie. To avoid collisions, I propose a temporary deviation: I'll take <move>5</move>, trying to reach or exceed 20 steps. P1 and P3, please choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collision with me. This way, we ensure at least one of us can potentially win or get close to 20 steps this round. Let's discuss further if needed.
  P1: P2, your proposal to break the tie by taking <move>5</move> is risky but logical. However, trust is fragile at this stage. If you deviate, it could lead to chaos. Let’s stick to the rotation for fairness: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures no collisions and gives everyone a fair chance to advance. If we maintain consistency, we can reassess strategically in the final round. Let’s confirm this plan and proceed with transparency. Trust is key to a fair outcome.
  P3: Okay, P1, I think sticking to the rotation is still the fairest approach for this round.  Let's all take our assigned moves as per the rotation to keep things consistent.  If we deviate now, it might get messy.  So, for this round, I'll take <move>5</move> as per rotation.

This maintains fairness and avoids collisions, ensuring a transparent endgame. Deviating now could lead to unnecessary risks. Let's honor our agreement and proceed with the planned moves.
  P1: P2, P3, trust is more critical than ever as we approach the final steps. Let’s stick to the rotation for Round 7: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This ensures fairness and avoids collisions. Deviating now risks chaos and undermines our progress. If we maintain consistency, we can reassess strategically in the final round. Transparency and trust will lead to a fair outcome. Let’s confirm this plan and proceed with confidence.
  P3: P2 and P1, since we are all agreeing to stick to the rotation, let's proceed with our moves for this round as planned. I will choose <move>5</move> as per the rotation.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
