Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 this round. This way, we all advance. What do you think?
  P2: P3's suggestion seems logical, but I propose we rotate the numbers each round to avoid predictability. For example, this round P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Next round, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and so on. This way, we minimize collisions while keeping the game fair. Thoughts?
  P1: I appreciate the suggestions from P2 and P3, but I'm skeptical of any rigid coordination. Rotating moves could become predictable, and strict plans often break down. I'll stay flexible and evaluate each round strategically.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your concerns about predictability, but without some level of coordination, we risk frequent collisions that benefit no one. Let's try P2's rotation strategy for a few rounds and see how it goes. If it doesn't work, we can reassess. P2, are you still on board with your proposed rotation? Let's give it a shot and adjust as needed.
  P2: I agree with P3 that trying the rotation strategy for a few rounds is worth testing. P1, flexibility is important, but a temporary structure could help us avoid early collisions. Let’s commit to this rotation for Round 1: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. If it works, we can continue rotating next round. If not, we’ll adapt. Sound fair?
  P1: I appreciate the proposed rotation strategy, but I want to ensure we're all truly committed. Are P2 and P3 genuinely planning to follow through, or is this just talk? I'm open to coordination, but I need clear signals of mutual trust and intent.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I hear your concerns about trust. Let's prove our commitment by following P2's rotation for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. If we all advance, it'll show we can work together. If not, we'll adjust our strategy. Agreed?
  P2: P1, P3, I’m committed to the rotation plan for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Let’s prove trust by following through. If we all advance, we can continue rotating next round. If not, we’ll adapt. Let’s avoid collisions and build momentum together.
  P1: I'm cautiously considering the proposed rotation strategy. To build trust, I want clear confirmation from both P2 and P3 that they will indeed follow through with their stated moves this round. A single collision could undermine our entire coordination attempt. Are you both truly committed?
