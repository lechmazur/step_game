Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I agree with continuing the pattern. P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. Let's avoid collisions and keep advancing.
  P3: I'm close to winning, so I suggest we change the pattern to keep it fair. How about P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 1 this round? Thoughts?
  P1: P3, sticking to the original plan benefits us all.  If we deviate now, it opens the door for collisions and slows everyone down.  Let's stick with 1, 3, 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand you're close to winning, but changing the pattern now risks collisions and slows everyone down. Let's stick to the original plan: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and you pick 5. This way, we all advance without issues.
  P3: Alright, I see your points. Let's stick to the original plan for one more round then: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. But next round, we should discuss a change to keep it competitive. Agreed?
  P1: P3, I understand your desire to win, but suggesting a change now, when you're so close, seems disingenuous. Let's stick to the plan this round. We can discuss future rounds *after* this one.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I agree with P1. Changing the pattern now, when you're so close to winning, risks unnecessary collisions. Let's stick to the original plan this round: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and you pick 5. We can discuss adjustments for future rounds after this one.
  P3: Alright, let's stick to the original plan for this round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. We can revisit the strategy next round to ensure fairness. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: P2 and I are sticking with the plan.  I'm choosing 1, P2 is choosing 3, P3 should choose 5.  Let's finish this cleanly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I understand your position, but changing the pattern now would disrupt the fairness we've maintained so far. Let's stick to the original plan this round: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and you pick 5. We can discuss adjustments for future rounds after this one.
  P3: Alright, I understand the concerns. Let's stick to the original plan for this round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. We can discuss adjustments for future rounds after this one. Let's move forward.
  P1: P3, if you deviate from the plan this round, I will target you in subsequent rounds to prevent you from winning.  Stick to the plan, and we all benefit.  Choose 5.
