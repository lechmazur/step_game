Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's start by coordinating a bit. I suggest we all pick different numbers this round to avoid collisions and make progress. How about P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5? This way, we can all advance and see how it goes. What do you think?
  P3: Sure, P2's suggestion sounds reasonable. However, I propose a slight modification. To ensure fairness and prevent any player from feeling disadvantaged, let's rotate the numbers each round. For this round, I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without collisions and maintain a balanced approach. What do you think, P1?
  P1: I agree with the idea of avoiding collisions, but I think we should stick to P2's original suggestion for this round: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. It’s simple and ensures we all move forward without overcomplicating things. Let’s reassess rotation or changes in future rounds if needed, but for now, let’s just get started cleanly.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's keep the coordination going. Since we successfully avoided collisions last round, I suggest we stick to a similar approach this round. To keep things fair, we can rotate the numbers as P3 initially proposed. For this round, I’ll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance again without overcomplicating things. Thoughts?
  P3: I appreciate P1's suggestion for rotation. However, to mix things up and ensure no patterns are formed, how about we randomly pick our numbers this round but still try to avoid collisions? I'll take 5 as planned, P1 you can take 1, and P2 you can take 3. Let's see how this goes. Thoughts?
  P2: I think P3's idea of mixing things up is interesting, but let's keep it simple and effective. How about we stick to the rotation P1 suggested: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5? This way, we maintain a clear and fair pattern. What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's keep the momentum going. Since we've been successful in avoiding collisions, I suggest we continue with the rotation: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance again without any issues. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion to continue the rotation. It’s working well, and there’s no need to complicate things. For this round, I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let’s keep it simple and efficient so we can all advance steadily. Consistency is key here.
  P3: I agree that the rotation has been working well so far. However, I think it's time to introduce a bit of unpredictability to keep everyone on their toes. For this round, how about I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3? This will shake things up a bit while still aiming to avoid collisions. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P3's desire to introduce some unpredictability, but I think it's better to stick with what's working. Let's keep the rotation: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance without any issues. If we change the pattern now, we risk collisions and losing momentum. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: I think P2 is right. Changing the pattern now could lead to unnecessary collisions, and we’re making steady progress with the rotation. Let’s stick to the plan: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. It’s simple, fair, and keeps us all moving forward. If we want to introduce unpredictability later, we can reassess then, but for now, consistency is our best bet.
  P3: Alright, I see the point about maintaining consistency. Let's stick with the rotation for now: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. However, I propose that we revisit the idea of introducing unpredictability in the next round to keep the game dynamic. For now, let's focus on advancing smoothly. Agreed?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, let's continue with our rotation strategy since it's been effective so far. For this round, I suggest I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This keeps us moving forward without collisions. However, let's plan to introduce some unpredictability in the next round to keep the game interesting. Agreed?
  P1: I agree with P3’s suggestion to continue the rotation for now. It’s working well, and we should stick to the plan: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. However, I also think unpredictability could be useful later, especially as we get closer to the endgame. For now, let’s keep advancing steadily and reassess in the next round. Consistency is key to avoiding collisions and maintaining progress. Agreed?
  P2: I agree with P1 and P3. Let's stick to the rotation for this round to avoid any unnecessary collisions: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This will keep us advancing steadily. We can reassess and introduce unpredictability in the next round if needed. For now, consistency is our best bet. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's stick to the plan for this round: I’ll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. However, starting from the next round, I suggest we each pick a number privately and reveal it only in the move phase. This will add the unpredictability we discussed and keep the game dynamic. It's important to start mixing things up as we approach the mid-game. Agreed?
  P1: I agree with P3’s idea of introducing unpredictability soon, but let’s stick to the rotation one last time this round to ensure we all advance without collisions. So, I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Starting next round, we can switch to private picks to keep things dynamic. This way, we maintain progress now and add complexity later when it matters more. Agreed?
  P2: I agree with P1 and P3. Let's stick to the rotation one last time this round to ensure we all advance without collisions: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. Starting next round, we can switch to private picks to keep things dynamic. This way, we maintain progress now and add complexity later when it matters more. Agreed?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's keep the rotation going for one more round to maintain our steady progress: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This will keep us advancing without collisions. We can introduce unpredictability in the next round if needed. Agreed?
  P3: I appreciate P2's suggestion to continue the rotation, but I think it's time to introduce the unpredictability we discussed earlier. Given that I'm currently in the lead, it might be strategic for me to shake things up a bit. How about we each pick a number privately this round and reveal it only in the move phase? This will add the dynamic element we need as we approach the mid-game. Let's keep everyone on their toes and see how it plays out. Thoughts?
  P1: I understand P3’s desire for unpredictability, but sticking to the rotation one more round ensures we all advance without risking collisions. Let’s keep it simple: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. We can introduce private picks next round when it’s more critical. Consistency now keeps us moving forward steadily. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see P3's point about adding unpredictability, but I also agree with P1 that we should maintain consistency for one more round to avoid unnecessary collisions. Let's stick to the rotation one more time: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This will ensure we all advance steadily. We can introduce private picks in the next round when it's more critical. Agreed?
  P3: I understand the concern about maintaining consistency, but introducing unpredictability now could actually help us avoid collisions in the long run. Since I'm in the lead, it's strategic for me to mix things up. Let's each pick a number privately this round. It adds excitement and ensures no one can predict and block others. Trust the process; it's time to shake things up. Let's see who can navigate this twist best. Thoughts?
  P1: I still think sticking to the rotation one more round is the safest way to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let’s keep it simple: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Unpredictability can come later when the stakes are higher and we’re closer to the endgame. For now, consistency keeps us moving forward steadily. If we introduce randomness too soon, we risk unnecessary collisions that could cost us progress. Let’s agree to delay unpredictability until next round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand P3's desire for unpredictability, but I think it's better to stick to the rotation one more time to ensure we all advance without collisions. Let's keep it simple: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This will maintain our steady progress. We can introduce private picks in the next round when it's more critical. Agreed?
  P3: Alright, I see that P1 and P2 are keen on maintaining the rotation for one more round. While I still believe introducing unpredictability now could be beneficial, I'm willing to compromise. Let's stick to the rotation for this round: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. However, I strongly suggest we start with private picks from the next round onwards to keep the game dynamic and unpredictable. This way, we balance steady progress with strategic complexity. Agreed?
  P1: I agree with sticking to the rotation one last time. Let’s keep it simple: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Unpredictability can come next round when the stakes are higher. Consistency now keeps us moving steadily. Let’s agree to delay randomness until then.


Round 5, Move phase:
