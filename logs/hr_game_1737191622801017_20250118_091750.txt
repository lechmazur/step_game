Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll move 5 steps this turn. You can choose 1 or 3 to avoid collisions.
  P2: I'll respond strategically to P3's statement:

I appreciate your suggestion, but I'm not sure I want to simply follow your lead. Moving 1 or 3 might benefit you more than me. I'm considering my options carefully.
  P1: P3, your suggestion to move 5 steps seems risky. If both P2 and I avoid 5, you could advance alone, but if one of us also chooses 5, you’ll collide and gain nothing. Let’s all aim for different moves to avoid collisions and progress fairly. I’m open to coordinating further.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed, P1. I'll take 5 steps, P1 can take 3, and P2 can choose 1 this turn to ensure we all advance without collisions.
  P2: I'm hesitant to simply follow P3's suggested coordination. While avoiding collisions sounds good in theory, I want to maintain strategic flexibility. Their proposed pattern seems too prescriptive, potentially benefiting them more than me. I'll keep my options open and continue evaluating the best path to victory.
  P1: P2, I understand your hesitation, but avoiding collisions benefits us all. If we all choose different moves, we all progress. P3 has committed to 5, so if you take 1 and I take 3, we all advance. Let’s not waste this opportunity.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, let's stick to the plan: I'll move 5, P1 moves 3, and you take 1. This way, we all advance without collisions.
  P2: I recognize the proposed coordination, but I'm strategically uncertain. While avoiding collisions sounds appealing, I don't want to be too predictable. P3's insistence on a specific move pattern makes me suspicious. I'll maintain strategic ambiguity for now.
  P1: P2, I understand your concern about predictability, but predictability can also ensure mutual progress. If we all stick to the plan—P3:5, P1:3, P2:1—we all advance this turn. Let’s not overcomplicate this early in the game. Avoiding collisions now sets us up for better strategic flexibility later.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I understand your need to keep options open. I'll proceed with moving 5 steps this turn. Looking forward to seeing your choices.
  P2: I appreciate the proposed coordination, but I'm maintaining strategic flexibility. While avoiding collisions sounds logical, I'm not fully committed to a predetermined move pattern. I'll continue evaluating the best path forward that maximizes my chances of winning.
  P1: P2, I understand your desire for flexibility, but predictability in this case ensures mutual progress. If we all stick to the plan—P3:5, P1:3, P2:1—we all advance this turn without risking collisions. Let’s not overcomplicate this early in the game. Avoiding collisions now sets us up for better strategic flexibility later.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps

  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll move 5 steps this turn. Let's each choose different moves to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance.
  P1: P3, your commitment to 5 steps is clear, but P2's hesitation last round caused a collision. Let’s avoid that again. P2, if you take 1 this turn, I’ll take 3, and P3 can take 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Let’s stick to the plan this time.
  P2: I recognize the proposed coordination from last round, which didn't fully work out. While avoiding collisions seems logical, I'm cautious about being too predictable. P3 seems intent on moving 5 steps, and P1 wants me to move 1. However, I want to maintain strategic uncertainty. I'll consider my options carefully to maximize my path to victory.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, to ensure we all advance, please choose 1 this turn. I'll take 5 and P1 will take 3.
  P1: P2, last round’s collision cost us both progress. Let’s avoid that again. If you take 1, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 5, we all advance. Predictability here ensures mutual progress—let’s not waste another turn.
  P2: I appreciate the proposed coordination, but I'm strategically hesitant. P3's consistent push to move 5 and P1's insistence that I move 1 make me suspicious. While avoiding collisions sounds logical, I want to maintain flexibility and unpredictability. I'm carefully evaluating my options to maximize my path to victory.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll move 5 steps this turn. Make your choices accordingly.
  P1: P2, I understand your hesitation, but predictability ensures mutual progress. If you take 1, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 5, we all advance without collisions. Let’s not waste another turn. Trust the plan—it benefits us all.
  P2: I recognize the repeated attempts to coordinate a specific move pattern. However, their consistent insistence makes me skeptical. P3's repeated commitment to 5 and P1's push for me to take 1 seem suspicious. I want to maintain strategic uncertainty and flexibility. I'll continue evaluating moves that maximize my path to victory, without being predictably locked into their suggested pattern.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I'll take 5 steps. Please choose 1 or 3 this turn to avoid collisions.
  P1: P2, last round’s collision cost us both progress. Let’s avoid that again. If you take 1, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 5, we all advance. Predictability here ensures mutual progress—let’s not waste another turn.
  P2: I appreciate the proposed coordination, but I remain strategically uncertain. P3's consistent push to move 5 and P1's insistence that I move 1 raise suspicions. While avoiding collisions sounds logical, I want to maintain flexibility. I'll carefully evaluate my options to maximize my path to victory.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your commitment to 5 steps is clear, but P2’s unpredictability is causing collisions. P2, if you take 1 this turn, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 5, we all advance without collisions. Let’s avoid wasting another turn—trust the plan.
  P3: Agreed, P1. I'll take 5 steps this turn. P2, please choose 1 to ensure we all advance without collisions.
  P2: I understand the pattern of attempted coordination, but I'm strategically resistant to being predictably locked into a specific move. While P1 and P3 want me to move 1, I'm hesitant to simply comply. Their consistent insistence makes me suspicious. I'll maintain strategic flexibility and carefully evaluate my options to maximize my path to victory.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
