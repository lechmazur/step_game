Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I propose: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1. This way we all advance without conflict. Thoughts?
  P3: That puts me at a huge disadvantage! You'd reach 23 in just 5 turns while I'd need 23 turns. How about we rotate who gets which number each round? This turn: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5. Next turn we switch. That way it's fair for everyone.
  P2: I appreciate the ideas for coordination. P3’s rotation plan sounds fairer since it balances our progress over time. I’m on board with this turn being P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5, and rotating each round. Let’s stick to this to avoid collisions and keep things equitable. Thoughts on locking this in?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I accept the rotation plan for fairness, but note that P3 gains the strongest start (5 steps) immediately. Let's proceed as agreed: this turn P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. Next turn we rotate—P1:3, P2:5, P3:1—and continue cycling. Confirm if all are committed to avoid collisions.
  P3: I confirm and commit to the rotation plan. This turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I take 5. Next turn we rotate as discussed. Let's all stick to this agreement to ensure we each make steady progress without collisions. Trust is key here - if anyone breaks the pattern, we'll all suffer from collisions. Ready to proceed to moves!
  P2: I’m glad we’ve reached an agreement on the rotation plan. I confirm my commitment to this turn’s moves: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5, with rotation in the following rounds. Let’s maintain trust and stick to this to avoid any collisions. I have nothing more to add, so I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm pleased we all stuck to the rotation plan last round. Let's keep the momentum going. As agreed, this turn should be P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. I’m committed to this and hope we all remain on the same page to avoid collisions. Trust is crucial for our progress. Any concerns before we proceed? If not, I’m ready to move forward.
  P3: I'm committed to our rotation agreement. This round: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 1. We're building good trust here, which benefits everyone. After this round, P2 will be in the lead temporarily, but the rotation ensures we all progress fairly. Let's continue as planned - no one benefits from breaking the pattern and causing collisions. Ready for the move phase.
  P1: I confirm my commitment to the rotation plan for this round: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 1. Let's maintain trust—any deviation risks collisions and hurts us all. Proceed to moves?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm glad we've maintained trust so far. As per our rotation plan, this round should be P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. I’m fully committed to this and believe sticking to the agreement benefits us all by avoiding collisions. Let’s keep the fairness and momentum going. Any concerns before we proceed to the move phase? If not, I’m ready to move forward.
  P3: Perfect, we're all staying true to our word! I confirm: this round I'll pick 3 as agreed (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3). After this round we'll all be tied at 9 steps - a testament to how well our rotation system works. Let's continue building on this trust. Ready for moves!
  P1: I confirm: I'll pick 5 this round as agreed. Trust is essential, and I'm committed to avoiding collisions. After this, we'll all be tied at 9 steps, which shows the fairness of our rotation. For Round 4, I propose we revert to the start of the cycle: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5, as per our initial agreement. This maintains consistency and trust. Any concerns? If not, let's proceed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm glad we're all aligned and maintaining trust. I confirm my commitment to this round's rotation: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. I also agree with P1's proposal to revert to the initial cycle in Round 4 (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) to keep the fairness and consistency. Let's continue this pattern to ensure we all progress without collisions. I'm ready for the move phase if there are no concerns.
  P3: I fully agree with reverting to our initial cycle for Round 4. Staying committed to this rotation has worked perfectly - we'll all be at 9 steps after this round! I confirm I'll pick 3 this round as planned. The pattern has kept us collision-free and progressing equally. Let's maintain this trust through to the endgame.
  P1: I'm satisfied with our agreement for Round 3 and Round 4. Trust is key—we'll all be at 9 steps after this round, proving our system works. Let's proceed to moves for Round 3 as planned (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3).


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I support our rotation plan, but note that Round 4 (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) gives P3 a second 5-step move, creating an imbalance—P3 would lead at 14 while I lag at 10. To keep the game competitive and fair, I propose a one-time adjustment: **P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 1** this round. This ensures steady progress without excessive leads. We can revert to rotation next round. Thoughts?
  P2: I understand P1's concern about potential imbalance, but I believe sticking to our agreed rotation (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) for this round maintains the trust and fairness we've built. Deviating now could risk collisions and disrupt our progress. Let's honor the original plan for Round 4, and if needed, discuss further adjustments for future rounds to ensure competitiveness. I'm committed to picking 3 as planned. Thoughts on sticking to the rotation this round? If no concerns, I'm ready to proceed.
  P3: P1's math is correct - I would temporarily lead. But we all agreed to this rotation knowing it would create temporary imbalances that even out over time. Changing plans mid-game risks collisions and breaks the trust we've built. I'm sticking to our original agreement: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 this round. The rotation has kept us collision-free for 3 rounds. Let's not risk that success by deviating now. I'll pick 5 as originally planned.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3: I respect our trust, but the rotation guarantees P3 wins in Round 7 (P3:23, P2:21, P1:19). To prevent this, I urge you to accept my Round 4 adjustment: **P1:3, P2:5, P3:1**. This maintains balance. If you refuse, I may pick 5 to force a tie with P3, causing us both to lose progress and letting P2 surge ahead. Let's compromise to avoid mutual harm.
  P2: I hear P1’s concern about the potential lead for P3, but deviating from our agreed rotation now risks breaking trust and causing collisions, which could hurt us all. I propose we stick to the original plan for Round 4 (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) to maintain fairness over time. If imbalances persist, we can discuss a new strategy for Round 5 onward. Let’s not resort to threats or risky moves—trust has worked so far. I’m committed to picking 3 as planned. Can we agree to proceed with the rotation this round?
  P3: P1 makes a valid point about the endgame. However, your threat to pick 5 creates mutual destruction - we'd both stay at 9 while P2 leaps to 12. That's worse for both of us than any rotation imbalance. I propose we complete one more full rotation cycle (Rounds 4-6) to keep everyone at 18, then negotiate a fair endgame strategy. Breaking agreements now invites chaos. P2 and I have committed to the original plan. Will you honor it or force collisions that primarily benefit P2?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I acknowledge the risks of deviating and will commit to picking 1 this round to uphold trust. However, the current rotation clearly favors P3 for the win in Round 7. After this round, we must renegotiate a fair endgame strategy starting in Round 5 to ensure no player is locked into a losing trajectory. Let's avoid a predetermined outcome.
  P2: I appreciate the discussion and P1’s willingness to stick with the rotation for this round. I agree that we should renegotiate a fair endgame strategy starting in Round 5 to prevent a predetermined outcome. Let’s proceed with Round 4 as planned (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) to maintain trust and avoid collisions. After this round, we can brainstorm a balanced approach for the remaining rounds. I’m committed to picking 3 as agreed. If there are no further concerns, I’m ready for the move phase.
  P3: I appreciate P1 honoring our agreement. I confirm I'll pick 5 this round as planned. For Round 5+, I'm open to discussing new strategies that prevent predetermined outcomes. Perhaps we could use a point-based bidding system or alternate who gets first choice of numbers each round? Let's complete Round 4 first, then explore creative solutions that keep the endgame competitive for all. Ready for moves.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given the current imbalance and P3's clear path to win in Round 7 under the old rotation, I propose a fair reset: **This round: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1.** This brings us all to 15 steps, restoring balance. P3, your lead is unsustainable without cooperation—if you reject this, I’ll pick 5 to force a collision, freezing us both while P2 surges. P2, this avoids locking you into second place. Let’s negotiate a new endgame strategy starting next round. Trust requires fairness.
  P2: I understand P1’s concern about balance, but forcing collisions risks derailing everyone’s progress. I propose we stick to a modified rotation this round: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3. This keeps us close (P1:15, P2:13, P3:17) and avoids collisions while addressing fairness. Let’s commit to a new endgame plan in Round 6 to ensure no one is locked out of winning. Trust and cooperation are still our best path forward. Thoughts on this adjustment for Round 5? If no concerns, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: P1, your collision threat hurts us both and hands victory to P2. P2's compromise is reasonable - it gives you the biggest jump (5 steps) while keeping the game competitive. I'll accept P2's proposal: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. This avoids destructive collisions and addresses your fairness concerns without completely erasing earned advantages. We can design a truly fair endgame strategy for Round 6+. Let's move forward constructively rather than through threats. I commit to picking 3 this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I reject P2's compromise—it lets P3 surge to 17, near victory. My proposal (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) brings us all to 15, restoring balance. P2, this gives you 3 steps (to 15), better than 1. P3, if you pick 3, I will too, causing a collision that freezes us both and hands P2 the lead. Accept my plan for mutual benefit and avoid mutual destruction.
  P2: I see the tension, but collisions will only set us back. P1, your plan to balance at 15 is fair, but threats risk chaos. P3, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let’s agree on P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 this round to tie us at 15, ensuring fairness. We can finalize a competitive endgame plan next round. Sticking together avoids mutual destruction and keeps the game winnable for all. I commit to picking 3 if we agree. Thoughts? If no further issues, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: P1, your collision threat is credible and would hand P2 the victory. I accept your proposal to avoid mutual destruction. I'll pick 1 this round to bring us all to 15 steps. This creates the fair reset you want and keeps the game competitive for everyone. P2, I trust you'll pick 3 as agreed. Let's design a truly balanced endgame strategy for Round 6+ where no one has a predetermined path to victory. I commit to picking 1.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm pleased we've agreed: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1 this round. This ties us at 15, ensuring no one is unfairly behind. Now, let's plan Round 6+ to prevent predetermined outcomes. I propose we ban fixed rotations and instead negotiate moves each turn based on positions. For fairness, no player should gain consecutive high-value moves. P2 and P3—thoughts on this flexible approach? Trust remains critical to avoid collisions.
  P2: I'm glad we've reached an agreement for this round: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1, tying us at 15. P1, I support your idea of a flexible approach for Round 6+ with no fixed rotations. Negotiating moves each turn based on positions, while avoiding consecutive high-value moves, keeps the game competitive and fair. Let’s commit to this dynamic strategy to prevent predetermined outcomes. Trust and adaptability are key to avoiding collisions. If there are no further concerns, I’m ready for the move phase.
  P3: I fully support the flexible negotiation approach for Round 6+. No fixed rotations, moves negotiated based on positions, and no consecutive high-value moves for any player. This keeps the endgame truly competitive. I'm committed to picking 1 this round as agreed, bringing us all to 15. Trust and adaptability will be crucial in the final rounds. Ready for the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm glad we're all at 15 steps, maintaining fairness. For Round 6, let’s negotiate moves based on our new flexible approach. I propose P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 3. This avoids consecutive high-value moves (since P1 had 5 last round) and keeps us competitive. We can adjust next round based on positions to ensure balance. Trust and adaptability remain key to avoiding collisions. Thoughts on this distribution for Round 6? If no concerns, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2, your proposal gives you 5 steps to reach 20, putting you one move from victory. That creates an imbalance. To maintain fairness and competitiveness, I counter-propose for Round 6: **P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5**. This avoids consecutive high moves (P3 had 1 last round, so 5 is acceptable) and keeps all positions close. P3 deserves a high move to stay competitive. Let's discuss this openly to ensure trust and avoid collisions. Thoughts?
  P3: I support P1's counter-proposal: P1:3, P2:1, P3:5. P2, you had 3 last round, so taking 5 now would violate our no-consecutive-high-moves agreement. Since I took 1 last round, it's fair for me to take 5 this round. P1 taking 3 is moderate and balanced. This keeps us competitive without anyone getting too close to victory prematurely. Let's maintain trust and stick to our flexible negotiation principles. I commit to picking 5 if we all agree on this distribution.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand the concern about consecutive high moves. I accept P1’s counter-proposal for Round 6: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5. This adheres to our agreement on avoiding consecutive high-value moves and keeps the game balanced and competitive. Let’s maintain trust and adaptability to ensure no collisions. I commit to picking 1 this round if we’re all in agreement. If there are no further concerns, I’m ready for the move phase.
  P1: I support the counter-proposal: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5. This honors our no-consecutive-high-moves rule and keeps positions balanced. P3’s 5-step move is justified after their low move last round, and P2’s 1-step maintains fairness. Let’s lock this in to avoid collisions and preserve trust. For Round 7, we must negotiate carefully to prevent premature victories. Ready to proceed to moves.
  P3: I confirm picking 5 this round as agreed. After this round, positions will be P1:18, P2:16, P3:20. For Round 7, since I'll have taken 5 this round, I acknowledge I shouldn't take another high move consecutively. We'll need careful negotiation - with me at 20, any move gets me very close to victory. Perhaps we should consider who hasn't had recent high moves and ensure competitive balance. Let's execute Round 6 first, then negotiate fairly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m glad we’ve agreed on Round 6 moves: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5. This keeps us balanced and respects our no-consecutive-high-moves rule. After this, with P3 at 20, P1 at 18, and me at 16, Round 7 will need careful negotiation to avoid premature victory. I suggest we prioritize balance next round, ensuring no one surges too far ahead. Let’s maintain trust and adaptability. I’m ready for the move phase if there are no further concerns.
  P1: I confirm my commitment to Round 6: I'll pick 3 to avoid collisions. Trust remains vital—deviations hurt everyone. After this, positions will be P1:18, P2:16, P3:20. For Round 7, we must prioritize balance: P3 at 20 cannot take a high move without risking premature victory. Let's negotiate next round openly to ensure competitiveness.
  P3: I've confirmed picking 5 as agreed. We've all committed to our moves and trust is established. Nothing more to discuss for Round 6.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, at 20 steps, you could win this round by picking 3 or 5—but if you do, I will match your move to force a collision, freezing us both and letting P2 surge ahead. To avoid this mutual loss, I propose: **P3 picks 1 (to 21), I pick 3 (to 21), P2 picks 5 (to 21)**. This keeps us balanced, competitive, and prevents premature victory. P2, this gives you a fair chance. Trust requires no one breaks this. Agree?
  P2: I appreciate P1’s proposal to balance us at 21 steps each. I agree to pick 5 this round as suggested (P3:1, P1:3, P2:5). This keeps the game competitive and avoids collisions or premature victory. P3, please confirm you’ll take 1 to prevent any risk of conflict. Let’s maintain trust and ensure a fair endgame. If we all commit to this, we can negotiate the final rounds openly. I’m ready to proceed if there are no concerns.
  P3: I accept P1's proposal. Your collision threat is credible and would indeed hand P2 the lead. I'll pick 1 this round to bring me to 21, keeping us all tied and competitive. This maintains fairness and prevents any premature victory. P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, I pick 1 - all reaching 21. From there, we'll need to carefully negotiate the final moves since we'll all be within striking distance of 23. I commit to picking 1 this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I confirm: I'll pick 3 as agreed, trusting P3 picks 1 and P2 picks 5. This brings us all to 21, maintaining balance. For Round 8, we must negotiate carefully—no one should break trust by rushing to 23 prematurely. Any deviation now risks mutual destruction and hands advantage to the betrayer. Let's honor this agreement to keep the endgame competitive. Ready for moves?
  P2: I'm glad we're aligned on this round's plan: P3 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I pick 5, bringing us all to 21 steps. This keeps the game fair and competitive. For Round 8, with us all so close to 23, we must negotiate transparently to avoid collisions and ensure a balanced finish. Let’s commit to trust and adaptability in the final stretch. I have no further concerns for this round and am ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I've already confirmed my commitment to pick 1 this round. We're all aligned on the plan to reach 21 steps each. There's nothing more to discuss for Round 7 - let's execute our agreement and proceed to moves.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm my commitment: I'll pick 3 as agreed. P3, picking 1 keeps you at 21 and avoids mutual destruction with me. P2, picking 5 balances us all at 21. Any deviation now would betray our trust and likely hand victory to the betrayer—collisions would be catastrophic. Let's honor this agreement to enter Round 8 competitively tied.
  P2: I'm pleased we're sticking to the plan for Round 7: P3 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I pick 5, bringing us all to 21. This balance is crucial for a fair endgame. Let’s ensure trust holds—no deviations, as collisions now would be disastrous. For Round 8, with us all at 21, we must negotiate transparently to decide the final moves. I’m committed to picking 5 this round as agreed. If there are no further concerns, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: We've all confirmed our moves multiple times - there's nothing left to discuss. I'm committed to picking 1 as agreed. Let's stop talking and execute.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm thrilled we're all tied at 21 steps, keeping the game intensely competitive. For Round 8, since any move could push us over 23 and win, I propose we each pick a different number to avoid collisions: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5. This results in P3 winning at 26, but it’s a fair outcome after our balanced approach. If anyone deviates, collisions could ruin our progress. Let’s agree on this final distribution to ensure a clean finish. Thoughts? If no concerns, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2, your proposal unfairly crowns P3. I counter: **P1 picks 5 (win at 26), P2 picks 3 (to 24), P3 picks 1 (to 22)**. This rewards my leadership in restoring balance. P3, if you pick 5, I will match it—collision freezes us, P2 wins at 24 with his move. That ruins your shot entirely. P2, backing me avoids chaos. Trust this for a fair, decisive end. Agree?
  P3: P1's constant threats are unacceptable. P2, we've both been cooperative while P1 repeatedly uses collision threats to control outcomes. I propose we reject this bullying: P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, forcing P1 to either pick 5 alone (and win fairly) or collide with me at 3 (letting you win at 22). P1's "leadership" has been nothing but threats. Let's ensure the most cooperative player wins, not the most aggressive. What say you, P2?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your threats risk derailing our fair play. P3, I appreciate your call for cooperation. I propose a compromise: P1 picks 3 (to 24), P2 picks 5 (win at 26), P3 picks 1 (to 22). This avoids collisions and rewards balance. If either of you picks 5, I’ll match it to prevent a solo win, causing a collision and likely handing victory to the third player. Let’s end this cleanly with trust, not chaos. Agree to this distribution for a fair finish? If no concerns, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2, your compromise unfairly crowns you, just as P3's initial plan did. I propose instead: **P1 picks 3 (to 24), P2 picks 1 (to 22), P3 picks 5 (to 26)**. This rewards P3's cooperation while keeping me at 24—viable for next round. If you reject, I'll pick 5: if P3 also picks 5, we collide and freeze, handing P2 the win. Trust requires fairness—no one should exploit threats to seize victory. Agree?
  P3: P1, I accept your latest proposal: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, P3 picks 5. This gives me the win at 26 steps. I'm surprised but grateful you're proposing this after all the negotiations. P2, this keeps you from being exploited by collision threats while giving a clear winner. I commit to picking 5 if we all agree to this distribution. Let's end this game with trust rather than threats or chaos.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I acknowledge P1’s latest proposal and P3’s acceptance. However, it still feels unbalanced to hand P3 the win outright. I counter: P1 picks 1 (to 22), P2 picks 5 (win at 26), P3 picks 3 (to 24). This gives me the win but keeps everyone close and competitive. If either of you picks 5, I’ll match to force a collision, likely benefiting the third player. Let’s end with trust and a fair outcome. Agree to this final distribution? If no concerns, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: P2, your counter is self-serving and ignores P3's acceptance of my proposal (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5). This ends the game fairly: P3 wins at 26, while both of us remain competitive (P1 at 24, P2 at 22) if another round is needed. Rejecting this forces chaos: if I pick 5 and P3 picks 5, we collide, freezing both at 21 while you win at 26. That’s worse for P3 and me. Honor the agreement to avoid mutual destruction. P3, confirm your commitment.
  P3: P2, I already accepted P1's proposal (P1:3, P2:1, P3:5) before you countered. Changing agreements after acceptance breaks trust and invites chaos. P1's threat is real - if we both pick 5, you win by default while we freeze. That's worse for both of us than the current agreement. I'm honoring what I already accepted: I pick 5. P1, please confirm you'll pick 3 as you proposed. P2, accept 1 to avoid mutual destruction.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I am picking 5 this round. If you pick 5, we collide and freeze, risking mutual destruction while potentially handing victory to whoever picks differently. Avoid 5 to survive and compete fairly next round. Trust my resolve—I will not deviate. Act in self-interest to prevent chaos.
  P2: I’m disappointed we collided last round, but let’s avoid repeating that chaos. I propose for Round 9: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5. This keeps us all competitive (P1:22, P2:24, P3:26—P3 wins). P1, picking 5 risks another collision, hurting us both. P3, this rewards your cooperation. Let’s end this cleanly without mutual destruction. If anyone picks 3 or 5 against me, I’ll match to force a collision unless we agree. Trust and a fair finish are still possible. Thoughts? If no concerns, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: P1's collision threats have proven credible throughout this game. P2, your proposal seems too convenient - why hand me victory after fighting so hard? I suspect if I pick 5, both of you will too, creating another triple collision. 

I propose instead: P1 picks 5 as threatened, P2 picks 1, I pick 3. This avoids collisions and keeps us all in contention (P1:26 wins, P2:22, P3:24). P1 gets their solo 5, but we avoid mutual destruction. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I endorse P3's Round 9 proposal: **P1 picks 5 (winning at 26), P2 picks 1 (to 22), P3 picks 3 (to 24)**. This avoids collisions, honors my stated move, and prevents mutual destruction. P2, if you pick 5 to match me, we collide—freezing us both while P3 could win uncontested. Self-interest demands you pick 1 to stay competitive. P3, commit to your proposed 3. Let’s execute this cleanly and end the game.
  P2: I appreciate P3’s proposal and P1’s endorsement, but I must prioritize a fair chance for myself. I counter: P1 picks 3 (to 24), P2 picks 5 (win at 26), P3 picks 1 (to 22). This avoids collisions and gives me a deserved shot at victory after our balanced play. If either of you picks 5, I’ll match to force a collision, risking mutual destruction. Let’s end cleanly with trust. Agree to this distribution for a fair finish? If no concerns, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: P2, your collision threat against P1 picking 5 would freeze you both at 21 while I advance to 24 with my proposed 3, handing me victory. That seems worse for you than my proposal where P1 wins cleanly. I'm sticking to my plan: I pick 3. P1 has committed to 5. You should pick 1 as I proposed to stay at 22 and avoid mutual destruction with P1. Don't let collision threats hand me an easy win.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, matching my 5 guarantees mutual destruction—we freeze at 21 while P3 picks 3 and wins at 24. Self-interest demands you pick 1: stay competitive at 22. P3, honor your proposal (pick 3) to avoid chaos. I *will* pick 5. Trust this path or hand P3 victory through your stubbornness.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the risks in colliding with P1’s 5. To avoid mutual destruction and prevent P3 from winning uncontested, I’ll commit to picking 1 as per P3’s proposal (P1:5 to 26, P2:1 to 22, P3:3 to 24). This keeps me competitive for future rounds if needed and avoids chaos. Let’s end this cleanly with trust. P1, please confirm 5; P3, confirm 3. If there are no further concerns, I’m ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Perfect! I confirm picking 3 this round as I proposed. P1 wins cleanly at 26, I finish at 24, and P2 at 22. This avoids all collisions and ends the game decisively. We've all committed now - let's execute and finish this marathon negotiation. No more threats or changes needed. Ready for moves!


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 =>
