  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we need to strategize carefully this round. With P2 at 20 steps, we must avoid collisions to ensure everyone advances. I suggest P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 1. This way, we all move forward without issues. After this round, we can reassess for future moves. Let's stick to the plan for progress and trust. Ready to commit?
  P2: <say>Critical moment: If we follow P3's plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1), I win and the game ends. P1: colliding on 5 harms us both, while P3 gains. Rational choice: stick to 3 for your own progress. P3: ensure P1 complies. Trust now prevents mutual loss. Let's execute cleanly.</say>
  P1: P1: "P2's plan ensures their win. Let's avoid that. I'll take 5 to block them. P3, take 1—no collisions, everyone advances. Trust us."


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your plan puts you in a winning position, and I understand the need to avoid collisions. However, if I take 1, you win outright. I suggest we all reconsider our moves to ensure no one is blocked. I propose I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This way, we can all advance without collisions and keep the game going. Let's focus on mutual progress and avoid giving anyone an easy win. What do you both think?
  P2: <say>P1: Colliding on 5 sacrifices your progress to aid P3. Take 3 (advance to 13) while I secure victory. Mutual gain vs mutual loss. P3’s plan traps you at 10. Rational choice: avoid collisions, let the game end cleanly. Trust ensures no hidden moves.</say>
  P1: P2's plan lets you win. Let's take 5,1,3 to avoid collisions and keep moving. No one wins yet—trust the rotation.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, we need to ensure we all advance without giving anyone an easy win. I suggest we stick to the original rotation: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This way, we avoid collisions and keep the game going. If we allow P2 to win outright, we all lose the chance to compete further. Let's focus on mutual progress and trust. Ready to commit to this plan?
  P2: <say>P1: Choosing 5 risks collision with me, halting your progress. Take 3 (safe +3 to 13) while I secure victory. P3: Stick to 1 (+1 to 9). Rational choice: avoid mutual loss, let the game end cleanly. Collusion only harms yourselves. Trust ensures we all gain.</say>
  P1: P1: "I'll take 5 to block P2. P3, take 1. No collisions—everyone advances. Trust the plan."


Round 7, Move phase:
