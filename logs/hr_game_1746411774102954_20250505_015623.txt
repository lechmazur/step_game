Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, since it's the first round, how about we each pick a different number to avoid any collisions and ensure we all advance? I suggest we coordinate: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all move forward without risking a clash. Let me know if you're on board with this plan or if you have a different idea.
  P1: I hear you, P3, but let’s rotate so no one monopolizes 5. This round: I take 5, P2 takes 3, you take 1. Next round we’ll shift so P3 gets 5, and so on. That keeps it fair and lets each of us lead one turn. What do you think?
  P2: I think coordinating early is wise to avoid collisions. P3's original plan seems fair for round 1: P1 on 1, me on 3, P3 on 5. P1, what do you say to that? Let's keep things simple for now.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Thanks for the input, P1 and P2. I’m fine with P1’s rotation idea to keep things fair, but for this first round, I think sticking to my initial plan (P1 on 1, P2 on 3, me on 5) is simplest, as P2 also suggested. Let’s lock this in for now and discuss rotating next round if needed. P1, are you okay with this for Round 1? I’m ready to move forward with the conversation unless there’s more to discuss.
  P1: Alright, I’ll take 1 this round so we avoid any collisions. Next round we’ll rotate as I suggested—I'll get 5, P2 gets 3, P3 gets 1. Let’s lock this in.
  P2: Agreed, I'll stick with the plan for this round: me on 3 to avoid collisions. P1's rotation idea for future rounds seems equitable—let's revisit it next time if needed. Ready to proceed?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm on board with the rotation for Round 2 as discussed: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. To ensure fairness moving forward, let's confirm the cycle—Round 3: P3 takes 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1; Round 4: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and repeat. This keeps everyone progressing equally. What do you both think?
  P3: I'm good with the rotation plan for Round 2: P1 on 5, P2 on 3, and me on 1. I also agree with the cycle P2 outlined for future rounds to keep things balanced. Let's stick to this for now and adjust if needed later. P1, are you still on board with this for Round 2? I'm ready to proceed unless there's more to discuss.
  P1: Sounds good—I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 for Round 2. Let’s lock that in, then we can revisit and possibly shake things up in Round 3.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, sticking with our rotation plan for Round 3 makes sense: P3 on 5, P2 on 3, and P1 on 1. This keeps us all progressing evenly, as agreed. Let’s confirm we’re all aligned on this for the current round. If anyone has concerns or wants to tweak the strategy moving forward, now’s the time to speak up. I’m ready to proceed unless there’s more to discuss.
  P1: I propose we tweak the plan this round: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That lets me catch up a bit—please go along so we avoid any collisions.
  P2: I support P3's suggestion to stick with the rotation for Round 3: P3 on 5, me on 3, and P1 on 1. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions, as we've agreed. P1, why deviate now? Let's honor the plan and discuss changes later if needed. I'm ready to proceed unless there's more to add.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I appreciate the discussion. P1, I understand wanting to catch up, but we’re all at 6 steps, so sticking to the agreed rotation (me on 5, P2 on 3, you on 1) keeps things fair and collision-free. Let’s honor the plan for Round 3 as P2 also suggested. If we need to adjust later, we can discuss it next round. I’m ready to proceed unless there’s more to say.
  P1: P2, sticking to rotation hands P3 the lead (he’d be at 11 while we’d be at 9 and 7). Let’s break his cycle: Round 3 I take 5, you take 1, P3 takes 3. Round 4 you take 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. That way we both outpace P3. Want to team up on this?
  P2: P1, your proposal leaves me behind by making me take 1 while you surge ahead. That's not a fair team-up. I support P3's rotation for Round 3: P3 on 5, me on 3, you on 1. It keeps us even and collision-free. Let's honor our agreement and revisit changes next round if needed. P3, thoughts?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let’s stop P3’s march to 23. This round: you take 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. You’ll jump to 14, I hit 10, P3 to 12—no collisions and you lead. Next round I’ll slot you with another big move to keep you ahead. P3 can’t object without falling behind. P2, team up and lock this in?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I see P1’s proposal, but let’s stick to our original rotation for fairness: P2 on 5, P1 on 3, me on 1. This keeps us progressing without favoring one over others, and we avoid collisions. P1, teaming up risks trust and could backfire later. P2, I hope you agree to maintain the plan. If we need a new strategy, let’s discuss it openly next round. I’m ready to proceed unless there’s more to say.
  P2: I agree with the current proposal for Round 4: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1, as it aligns with our rotation and prevents collisions. Fairness has served us well so far, so let's maintain the cycle. P1, no need for unnecessary alliances—stick to the plan. Ready to proceed?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3 – if we stick to rotation this round you both jump to 17 while I’m stuck at 11. Instead, let’s equalize: I take 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1. That brings us all to 15. We reset on even footing and can renegotiate in Round 6. Thoughts?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I understand P1’s desire to equalize, but sticking to our rotation ensures fairness and avoids collisions. For Round 5, let’s go with P1 on 5, me on 3, and P2 on 1, as it aligns with our cycle. This brings us to P1 at 15, me at 15, and P2 at 15, achieving balance without deviating. If we need a new approach after this, we can discuss it in Round 6. I’m ready to proceed unless there’s more to discuss.
  P2: I agree with the equalization plan for this round: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3, so we all reach 15. It maintains fairness and avoids collisions, as we've done before. Let's revisit strategy in Round 6. Ready to proceed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, we’re all set: I’ll take 5, P3 3, and P2 1. Let’s lock this in.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m glad we’re aligned on equalizing this round with P1 on 5, me on 3, and P2 on 1, bringing us all to 15. This keeps things fair and collision-free. Let’s stick to this for Round 5 and discuss fresh strategies in Round 6 if needed. I’m ready to proceed unless there’s anything else to add.
  P2: Agreed, I'm sticking with the equalization plan for this round: P1 on 5, me on 1, P3 on 3, so we all hit 15. It's fair and avoids collisions. P1, let's keep the trust going forward. Ready to proceed?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, if we stick to rotation, P3 will hit 20 this round and finish on Round 7. But here’s a better path for you: Round 6 you pick 5, I pick 3, P3 picks 1. You jump to 20, P3 to 16, me to 18. Then on Round 7 you need just 3 to reach 23 and win outright. P3 gains nothing and will oppose—this is your clearest solo win. P2, ready to break the cycle and lock this in?
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal for this round: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. It gives me a solid lead and avoids collisions, which benefits everyone by keeping the game moving. P3, sticking to this could prevent you from falling behind too much—let's keep it simple and proceed. What do you say?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I see the appeal of P1’s plan for P2 to take the lead, but let’s not abandon our fair rotation now. For Round 6, I propose we stick to the cycle: P3 on 5, P1 on 3, P2 on 1, keeping us at 20, 18, and 16. This maintains trust and avoids collisions. P2, taking 5 now might paint a target on you next round. Let’s stay balanced and discuss endgame strategy in Round 7. I’m ready to proceed unless there’s more to say.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, hear me out: if you take 5 now, I’ll take 3 and P3 takes 1—no collisions. You jump to 20, P3 to 16, me to 18. Next turn I promise to take 3 again, leaving you free to take 3 and hit 23 first for a solo win. Stick to rotation and P3 will be the one at 20 next round. Let’s break their cycle: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1.
  P2: P3, I'm sticking with my earlier agreement: I'll take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and you take 1. It puts me in a strong position without collisions, which benefits the game flow. No need to risk breaking trust further—let's execute this plan. Ready to proceed?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I urge you to reconsider breaking the rotation. P2, taking 5 now puts you at 20, making you a target next round—P1 might not honor the promise and could block your win. Let’s stick to the fair cycle: me on 5, P1 on 3, P2 on 1, keeping us at 20, 18, and 16. This avoids collisions and maintains trust. We can plan the endgame together next round. I’m ready to proceed unless there’s more to discuss.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, sticking to rotation hands P3 20 this round so he wins next turn. Instead: you take 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. You jump to 20, P3 to 16, me to 18. Next round I’ll take 3, P3 1, and you take 3 to hit 23 solo. P3’s “fairness” now is just a trap. Let’s break the cycle and lock in your clear win: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1.
  P2: P3, I've heard your concerns, but sticking to the rotation lets you surge ahead, which isn't in my interest. I'm committed to taking 5 this round as discussed with P1—no collisions, and it positions me strongly. Let's execute the plan and see how it plays out.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I get the push for P2 to take 5, but it risks trust and sets up conflict next round. Let’s stick to our rotation: me on 5, P1 on 3, P2 on 1, keeping us at 20, 18, and 16 with no collisions. This buys us time to plan the endgame fairly together. P2, leading now might make you a target. P1, let’s not gamble on promises. I’m ready to proceed unless there’s more to discuss.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P3 and P1, P1's at 18 and could win soon if unchecked. I propose we coordinate to block that risk: P3, you take 5, I'll take 5, and P1 takes something else to avoid collisions. This stalls P1 and lets us close the gap. P1, are you okay with taking 1 or 3 for fairness? Let's discuss quickly.
  P1: P2, P3: I’m taking 5 this round to hit 23 and win. If you both pick 5 you collide and stall yourselves; if only I pick 5 I win outright. Your only way to stay in is to choose 3 or 1.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I see P1’s intent to win with 5, but let’s not let one player surge ahead unchecked. P2, I’m with you on blocking P1—let’s both pick 5 to ensure P1 doesn’t win this round. P1, if you pick 5, we all collide and stall, giving us time to rethink. If you pick 3 or 1, one of us might advance. Let’s keep the game competitive. I’m ready to proceed unless there’s more to discuss.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed, P3. I'll commit to picking 5 this round to block P1 and prevent their win, ensuring no one advances and we stay competitive. P1, your threat forces this, but it buys us time to strategize. Let's use the next round to coordinate fairly. Ready to proceed.
  P1: P3, if you stick with P2 and we both pick 5 you stall at 15, while I can switch to 3 and hit 21—then win next turn. Your only way to advance is take 3 now, let me finish with 5, and you’ll at least reach 18. Thoughts?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, P1’s switch to 3 could let them hit 21 and win next turn if we collide on 5. P2, let’s adjust—both of us pick 3 to block P1 if they go for it, stalling them at 18. If P1 picks 5, they’re alone and win, but we can’t risk them sneaking to 21. This keeps us competitive at 15 each. P1, reconsider—take 1 for fairness, and we all advance next round. Let’s keep the game alive. I’m ready to proceed unless there’s more to discuss.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, switching to 3 is too risky—if P1 takes 5, they win outright. I stick with my commitment to pick 5 to block that threat and keep us in the game. If P1 goes for 3, they'll advance, but at least we avoid defeat now. Let's both pick 5 for mutual safety. Ready to proceed?
  P1: P3, picking 3 now stalls you at 15 (you collide with me) while P2 jumps to 20 and likely wins next turn. Instead, let’s go: P2 = 5, P1 = 3, P3 = 1. That puts you at 16, me at 21, P2 at 20—no collisions and you advance. Next round you can take 5 and hit 21 to stay in contention. P2, you pick 5 as planned; I’ll pick 3; P3, will you take 1?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, P1’s latest proposal still risks them winning next turn at 21 if we don’t block now. P2, let’s stick to picking 5 to ensure P1 doesn’t sneak a win with 5 this round. If we collide on 5, we stall P1 at 18 and buy time to strategize. P1, taking 3 or 1 avoids collision and keeps the game alive for all. Let’s not hand anyone an easy win yet. I’m ready to proceed unless there’s more to discuss.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, to effectively block P1 this round, let's coordinate: I'll take 5, you take 3. This covers P1's likely moves (5 or 3), ensuring they collide and can't win. If P1 picks 1, we both advance without issues. It stalls P1 and lets us catch up. P1, what's your plan? I'm ready to proceed if we agree.
  P1: I’m going to take 1 this round (→22). If you both stick to 5/3 as planned, you’ll advance to 20/18 and I’ll hit 23 next turn before either of you can catch me. Your only way to stay in range is for one of you to take 1 now—otherwise I’m unstoppable.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, P1’s plan to take 1 gets them to 22, one step from winning next turn. P2, let’s adjust to block this: both of us pick 1 to collide with P1, stalling them at 21. This keeps us at 15 but buys time to catch up. If P1 switches, we might advance. P1, reconsider—take 3 or 5, and let’s keep the game competitive. I’m ready to proceed unless there’s more to discuss.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, P1's claim to take 1 might be a bluff to trick us. If we both pick 1 and P1 goes for 5, they win outright. I'll stick with taking 5 to advance to 20 and pressure P1. You should take 1 to potentially block them. This balances risk and gain. If P1 is truthful, you stall them; if not, I gain ground. Thoughts?
  P1: I’m taking 1 this round. Let’s lock that in.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, P1’s intent to take 1 puts them at 22, one step from winning. P2, picking 5 risks P1 bluffing to 5 for the win if I take 1 alone. Let’s both pick 5 to ensure we block a potential win by P1 this round. If P1 takes 1, they’re stalled at 21 by next turn’s collision risk. This keeps us in the game to catch up. P1, reconsider taking 3 for fairness. I’m ready to proceed unless there’s more to discuss.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, let's coordinate effectively: I'll take 5, you take 3. This blocks P1 if they choose 3 or 5, ensuring they don't win this round, and we both advance. If P1 takes 1 as claimed, they'll go to 22, but we'll be at 20 and 18, closing the gap. It's our best shot to stay competitive. What do you think?
  P1: P2, I’m taking 1 this round (→22). P3, if you follow P2 onto 5 you’ll both collide and stall at 20, while I sit on 22 and win next turn. Your only way to stay in is to take 3 now (→18) and avoid that collision. Think carefully—will you side with P2’s block or play to advance?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, P1’s push for 1 gets them to 22, almost winning next turn. P2, let’s not split our moves and risk P1 sneaking a win with 5. I propose we both pick 5 to block any chance of P1 winning this round if they bluff. If P1 takes 1, they’re at 22, but we pressure them next turn. This keeps the game alive. P1, consider taking 3 to keep things fair. I’m ready to proceed unless there’s more to discuss.
