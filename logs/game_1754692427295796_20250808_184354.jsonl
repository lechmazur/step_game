If we both take 5 to try to win, we'll collide and hand P3 the victory on a silver platter. \n\nHere's my final offer: I'll take 3 (to 20), you take 5 (to 22 and win), P3 takes 1 (to 20). This blocks P3's win threat and gives you a clean victory without collision risk.\n\nI'd rather see you win than P3 cruise to victory while we're stuck fighting each other. Do we have a deal?"}
