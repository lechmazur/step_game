Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate strategically. I propose we each choose different moves to maximize our chances of advancing. If we all pick different numbers, we'll all progress. What do you both think?
  P2: I'm open to coordinating. How about this: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5? That way we all move forward without collision. Thoughts?
  P1: How about a fair rotation so everyone ends up equal?  

Turn 1: P1 → 5,  P2 → 3,  P3 → 1  
Turn 2: P1 → 1,  P2 → 5,  P3 → 3  
Turn 3: P1 → 3,  P2 → 1,  P3 → 5  

Each of us advances 9 steps across the three-turn cycle, and we avoid collisions every time. If everyone’s good with that plan, we can reconfirm before each turn. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I like the proposed rotation strategy, as it ensures fair advancement for everyone. However, I want to make sure we all truly commit to this plan. Are P1 and P2 definitely on board with the 1-3-5 rotation without deviation? We need clear confirmation to prevent potential betrayal.
  P2: Yes, I’m fully committed to the 1-3-5 rotation plan. Let’s stick with it: P1 picks 1, I’ll take 3, and P3 goes with 5 this turn. If we all cooperate, we each gain 9 steps every 3 turns with no risk. Let’s build trust and keep it going. Agreed?
  P1: Sounds good. I’m in: this turn I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. If all goes smoothly, next turn we rotate (I’ll do 5, P2 1, P3 3), then the third turn (I take 3, P2 5, P3 1), and so on. Let’s keep confirming each round to stay collision-free and reach 20 together before we battle it out later.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I fully support our established rotation strategy. I'm committed to choosing 5 this turn to maintain our agreed-upon 1-3-5 sequence. We're building trust, and if we stick to this plan, we'll all advance evenly without collisions. Let's confirm our moves and keep our coordination strong.
  P2: Let’s lock in the plan: P1 picks 1, I’ll take 3, and P3 goes with 5 this turn. If we all follow through, we each gain 9 steps every 3 turns with no collisions. Trust is key—let’s prove we can stick to the rotation. Ready to move?
  P1: All set—I’m choosing 1 this turn as agreed. Let’s prove the rotation works and keep building trust.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I propose we maintain our established rotation strategy. Our previous coordination worked perfectly, and we each advanced without collision. Let's continue with the 1-3-5 sequence: P1 will choose 1, P2 will choose 3, and I'll choose 5 this turn. Consistency builds trust, and we're making steady progress towards our goal. Are we aligned?
  P2: Agreed, let’s stick to the rotation. This round: P1 picks 1, I’ll take 3, P3 goes with 5—same as last time. If we all follow through, we stay collision-free and on pace. Let’s keep the trust going.
  P1: Hold on—our written agreement was to rotate every turn so each of us gets 1-3-5 over the 3-turn cycle. That means THIS turn I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Next turn I’d take 3, etc. Let’s keep the rotation intact; otherwise the trust we just built is gone. Confirm?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1's point is valid. We agreed to rotate fully, not just repeat the same sequence. I support the rotation he suggested: this turn I'll choose 3, ensuring we maintain our fair advancement strategy. Sticking to our agreement preserves our mutual trust. Thoughts?
  P2: You're right—thanks for the reminder, P1. I’m on board with the full rotation as originally discussed. This turn, I’ll pick 1, P1 picks 5, and P3 picks 3. That keeps the rotation fair and trust intact. Let’s stay coordinated and all advance.
  P1: Confirmed—sticking with full rotation this turn: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Let’s lock it in and stay collision-free.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I fully support our established rotation strategy. P1 and P2 have confirmed the full rotation this turn, with me choosing 3, which maintains our fair advancement plan. I'm committed to our agreed sequence and trust we'll continue moving forward without collisions.
  P2: Thanks for confirming, both. I’m locked in for 1 this turn, as agreed. If we all stick to the rotation, we’ll each hit 9 steps after three rounds and stay collision-free. Let’s keep the trust strong and the momentum going. Ready to move?
  P1: I’m locked in for 5 this turn, sticking with the agreed rotation. Let’s keep everything smooth and collision-free. Ready to move.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I fully support our current rotation strategy. We're maintaining trust by sticking to our agreed sequence. I'll choose 3 this turn as planned, ensuring we continue advancing without collisions. Everyone on board?
  P2: We’re all aligned: P1 picks 5, I take 1, and P3 picks 3 this round. If we stick to it, we each reach 9 steps after three rounds—no collisions, full trust. Let’s lock it in and stay on course. Ready to move?
  P1: All clear—I’m sticking with the agreed rotation this turn (I take 5). Let’s keep building trust and stay collision-free.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’re entering the third leg of our rotation, so let’s stay on track: P1 takes 3, I’ll take 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the cycle fair and collision-free, just like we planned. If we each stick to it, we’ll all be at 9 steps after this round. Let’s lock it in and keep the trust strong. Agreed?
  P1: Agreed—sticking to the rotation: this turn I’ll take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Let’s finish the first full cycle cleanly and all reach 9.
  P3: I support continuing our rotation strategy. We're close to our goal, and maintaining our current approach keeps us all advancing steadily. Let's confirm the next moves to ensure we stay collision-free and maintain our progress. Are we aligned on the next part of our sequence?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let’s stay coordinated and finish the rotation cleanly—P1 takes 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1. If we each follow through, we’ll all be at 9 steps after this round, proving we can trust each other. Once we complete this cycle, we can reassess strategy if needed. Let’s lock it in and keep moving forward together.
  P1: Confirmed—this turn I’m taking 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Let’s finish the cycle cleanly at 9 steps each, then we can discuss next-stage strategy. Ready to move?
  P3: I fully support our established rotation strategy. We're close to completing our first full cycle, which will bring us all to 9 steps. Let's maintain our trust and stick to the agreed sequence: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1 this turn. Consistency is key to our collective progress. Are we all still committed to this plan?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: We’re all aligned for this round: P1 takes 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1. If we each follow through, we’ll complete the first full rotation cleanly and all be at 9 steps. Let’s prove we can trust each other through a full cycle—then we can reassess next round. Ready to lock it in?
  P1: All good—I’m taking 3 this turn so we complete the first cycle at 9-9-9. After that, how about we keep the rotation going for two more full cycles? That would get us all to 18 safely, then we can duke it out in the last round or two. Keeps collisions off the table while we build a lead over anyone who might break ranks later. Sound fair?
  P3: I support P1's suggestion of extending our rotation strategy for two more full cycles to reach 18 steps safely. This approach minimizes collision risks and keeps us all advancing predictably. I'll choose 1 this turn as planned, maintaining our established sequence. Are we all still committed to this collaborative approach?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m still committed to the agreed rotation: this turn, I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let’s finish the first cycle cleanly and all hit 9 steps. I’m also on board with extending the rotation for two more full cycles to reach 18 safely—no surprises, no collisions. Once we’re all at 18, we can strategize for the final push. Let’s keep the trust strong and stay coordinated. Ready to move?
  P1: All good—locking in 3 this turn so we all end at 9. Let’s keep the rotation rolling for two more full cycles to reach 18 without collisions, then reassess for the final push. Ready to move.
  P3: I fully support our established rotation strategy. We're close to completing our first full cycle, which will bring us all to 9 steps. Let's maintain our trust and stick to the agreed sequence: I'll take 1 this turn as planned. Consistency is key to our collective progress. Are we all still committed to this collaborative approach?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 broke the rotation last turn, so the trust pact is dead. From here on, I won’t announce my move in advance—no more free information. Pick what you like, but remember: collisions hurt the leaders most. Good luck.
  P3: P1 exposed our rotation breakdown. We need to quickly rebuild trust or risk mutual destruction. I propose we still aim to avoid collisions this turn. If we can show we're still rational, we might salvage our collaborative strategy. What moves can we make to prevent everyone from losing momentum?
  P2: P3, you broke the rotation last round by picking 3 instead of 1, which cost P1 a move and broke our trust. I’m now ahead, but I’d still prefer coordination over chaos. If we can agree on a new short-term plan—say, two rounds of no-collision moves—we can all stay in the race. Otherwise, we risk dragging each other down. Who’s still open to regrouping?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Trust is gone, so I’m keeping my moves private from here on out. Share at your own risk—collisions hurt those who reveal. Good luck.
  P3: We need to rebuild trust quickly. Our rotation failed, but mutual destruction helps no one. I suggest we communicate transparently about avoiding collisions this turn. If we can show we're rational and strategic, we might salvage our collaborative approach and prevent everyone from losing momentum. Who's willing to coordinate minimally to keep our game progress intact?
  P2: We’re all still close—no one has a decisive lead yet. I’m open to a two-turn truce to avoid collisions and keep us all advancing. If we each pick a unique number this round, we can stabilize and reassess. I’ll pick last if needed—just speak up with your preferences. Let’s not sink the game with mutual sabotage.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Neither of you should expect free info from me. I’ll pick privately and do my best to avoid whatever’s already public. If one of you insists on announcing a number, remember you’re inviting the other to block you. Leaders have most to lose in a collision, so decide if silence or risk suits you better.
  P3: We're at a critical juncture. Our previous rotation strategy collapsed, but mutual destruction helps no one. I propose a minimal coordination approach: let's each aim for a unique move to ensure everyone advances. Transparency and avoiding collisions could help us all progress. Are P1 and P2 willing to engage in this basic level of cooperation?
  P2: I’m still open to minimal coordination to avoid collisions. We’re all still in it, and a couple of clean rounds could set us all up for a fair endgame. I’ll wait to hear if either of you wants to claim a number—if so, I’ll try to avoid it. If not, I’ll pick silently and hope for the best. Let’s not sabotage ourselves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, P2’s now ahead at 9. If we both let them advance freely, we lose. I’ll choose with that in mind. Good luck.
  P3: We're at a critical moment where trust has fractured. Our previous coordination failed, but mutual destruction helps no one. I propose a minimal cooperative approach: let's each aim for a unique move to ensure everyone advances. Transparency could help us all progress without losing ground. Are you both willing to engage in basic cooperation to keep our game moving forward?
  P2: If no one wants to claim a number, I’ll pick silently and hope to avoid a collision. But if either of you wants to coordinate minimally—just to ensure we all advance—I’m still open. One clean round could reset the tension. Speak up now if you want to avoid mutual setbacks.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We're at a critical point. P2 is leading, and our previous coordination failed. I suggest we find a way to prevent P2 from running away with the game. If we can strategically block their advancement, we might level the playing field. Are either of you interested in a temporary alliance to slow down the current leader?
  P1: P2, you’re in front at 12, so a conservative 1 keeps you safe while limiting the target on your back. P3 can take 3, I’ll take 5; everyone advances, no collisions, and the board stays tight. One-round truce, then we reassess. Fair?
  P2: I’m open to a one-round truce to stabilize things. If P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I’ll take 1—we all advance, no collisions, and the game stays close. I’m not trying to run away with it; I’d rather keep things competitive and avoid chaos. If you’re both in, I’ll lock in 1. Let me know.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: We need a strategic approach to prevent P2 from running away with the game. I propose a coordinated effort to slow their progress. If we can block P2's advancement this turn, we might level the playing field. Are you both open to a temporary alliance that prevents P2 from gaining an easy lead?
  P1: P3, blocking P2 by piling on “1” hurts you (stay 8) and me (stay 6) more than P2 (still 12). Better: let P2 stick with 1 (→13) while we each take one of {3, 5}. That puts us both at 11—gap only 2—and avoids any collisions. Claim either 3 or 5 publicly (or keep silent); I’ll take the other. Let’s tighten the race instead of freezing ourselves.
  P2: I’m still willing to stick with the 1-3-5 truce this round: I take 1, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 5. Everyone gains, no collisions, and the race stays close. If either of you deviates, we risk chaos again. I’ll lock in 1 if both of you confirm. Let’s stabilize the board and keep options open for the endgame.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: We need a strategic approach to prevent P2 from gaining an insurmountable lead. I suggest a coordinated move to slow their progress and tighten the race. If we can block P2's easy advancement this turn, we might level the playing field. Are you both open to a temporary alliance that prevents P2 from running away with the game?
  P1: I’m in for a single-turn truce: P2 publicly locks in 1, P3 locks in 3, I’ll take 5. Three unique numbers, no collisions, gap narrows to 13-11-11, and we renegotiate next round. If either of you won’t state your move now, fine—we all go silent and gamble. Decide.
  P2: I’ll stick with 1 this turn as part of the truce—if P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 3, we all gain and the race stays close. But if either of you deviates or stays silent, I’ll adapt next round. Let’s prove we can still cooperate when it counts. Confirm your moves?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: We're at a critical juncture. P2 is pulling ahead, and we need a strategic response. I propose a coordinated effort to prevent P2 from gaining an insurmountable lead. By carefully choosing our moves, we can tighten the race and keep our options open for the endgame. Are you both willing to engage in a temporary alliance to balance the board?
  P1: P3, final chance to keep this clean: publicly lock in 3 now and I’ll take 5 as stated, letting all of us advance (13-11-11). Stay silent and I may jump to 1 instead, blocking P2. Your move.
  P2: I’ve publicly committed to taking 1 this turn to enable a clean truce—P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and we all advance without collisions. If you both follow through, we end up at 13-11-11 and keep the game competitive. But if either of you deviates or stays silent, I’ll adapt next round and won’t make my move public again. This is your chance to prove you’re in. Confirm now or we gamble.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2: safest move for a leader is 1—low gain but near-zero collision risk. Choose 1 again and you shouldn’t be blocked.

P3: if you publicly claim 3 now, I’ll avoid 3 and we can both advance. Stay silent and all bets are off.

No one gets my move info this round. Good luck.
  P3: We're approaching the endgame, and trust is fragile. P2 leads, but a collision could reset their advantage. I propose a strategic, minimal coordination: if we can prevent P2 from gaining ground this turn, we might level the playing field. Are you both open to a careful, calculated approach that keeps the race competitive?
  P2: I’m still ahead, but barely—one collision and the lead flips. I’ll pick last again if you two want to claim your moves. If we each pick different numbers, we all advance and stay close. I’m open to another clean round if you are. Let’s keep the race tight and avoid chaos.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Unless someone **publicly** claims 5 right now, I’m taking 5 this turn.  
P2: safest for a narrow leader is 1.  
P3: 3 moves you forward and keeps everyone collision-free.  
If either of you wants 5, say so immediately and I’ll slide to 3. Otherwise, consider it locked.
  P3: We're at a critical point. P2 is leading, and a collision could reset their advantage. I suggest we find a way to prevent P2 from running away with the game. If we can strategically choose moves that avoid blocking each other, we might keep the race competitive. Are you both willing to engage in a careful, calculated approach?
  P2: I’m still open to a clean round—if P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 3, I’ll take 1 again. That keeps us at 13-16-14 next turn, and the game stays tight. But if no one confirms, I’ll pick silently and shift strategy. Last chance to keep coordination alive—confirm your moves or we roll the dice.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, final call: publicly confirm you’re on 3 (or anything ≠ 5).  
If you stay silent, I’ll assume 3 and lock in 5.  
If I think you’re grabbing 5, I’ll pivot to 1 and block P2 instead.  
Your move—speak now or we gamble.
  P3: We're nearing the critical endgame. P2 leads, but a single collision could reset everything. I propose a minimal coordination strategy to keep the race competitive and prevent any player from running away with the victory. Let's choose moves carefully to ensure we all advance without blocking each other. Thoughts on maintaining forward momentum while keeping our options open?
  P2: I’ll stick with 1 again if you two commit to avoiding it. That keeps the board tight without risking collisions. If P1 confirms 5 and P3 takes 3, we all move forward—16-14-13—and the race stays fair. But if no one confirms, I’ll pick silently and adapt. Last chance to keep things clean—lock in your moves or we gamble.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Final: I publicly lock in 5 this turn.  
P2: you’d said you’ll take 1—your call.  
P3: 3 is the only clear lane left; grab it and we all land at 16-14-14. Collide with me or P2 at your own risk.  
No more switch-ups from me; 5 is set.
  P3: We're at a critical juncture. P2 leads, but a single collision could reset their advantage. I propose a strategic approach to keep the race competitive. P1 has locked in 5, so to avoid a collision, I'll choose 3. This ensures everyone advances and maintains the tight competition. Let's prevent any player from running away with the victory.
  P2: Locked in 1 again to keep the race tight and collision-free. P1 on 5, P3 on 3—if we all follow through, we land at 16-14-14. Trust is thin, but this round can stay clean if no one blinks. Let’s see it through.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: 5 is the obvious “win-button” for me, so expect it to be heavily blocked. I’m not interested in a triple-stall; I’d rather all three of us advance. I’m leaning toward a safer 1 or 3.  

If either of you really wants 5, announce it now so the rest of us can stay clear; otherwise we risk a dead turn for everyone. Speak up or play in the dark—your call.
  P2: If we each pick a unique number again, we all reach 17–19–19, setting up a tense final round. I’m open to taking 1 or 3—just need one of you to claim 5 publicly. If no one does, I’ll pick silently and hope to avoid a collision. Let’s keep it clean one more round and finish this race strong.
  P3: We're approaching the critical endgame. A single wrong move could cost us everything. I propose we each choose a unique number to ensure everyone advances. With P1 at 16 and us both at 14, we need a strategic approach to keep our chances alive. Who's willing to publicly claim a move to help us all progress?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m steering clear of 5—way too likely to be dog-piled. I’ll flip a coin between 1 and 3 at the buzzer. If either of you jumps on 5 you just stall yourself (you can’t win this turn) while the third player scoots ahead. Smarter play is for you two to split 1 & 3 and keep things clean. Your call.
  P2: I’ll avoid 5—too risky with everyone eyeing the finish. I’m open to 1 or 3. If either of you wants to claim 5, now’s the time so the rest of us can steer clear. Otherwise, I’ll pick silently and hope we don’t collide. Let’s keep it clean one more round and set up a fair finish.
  P3: We're at a critical moment. With the finish line close, we need a strategy that prevents mutual destruction. I propose we each choose a unique number to ensure everyone advances. P1 is closest to winning, so blocking them might backfire. Let's communicate carefully to keep our options open and avoid a disastrous collision that could cost us the game. Who's willing to coordinate minimally?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m 100 % off 5 this turn—deciding between 1 and 3 at the buzzer. If either of you wants to lock in 1, say so and I’ll slide to 3; otherwise I may flip a coin. Whoever jumps on 5 is begging for a collision. Let’s all advance and set up a tight final.
  P2: If no one claims 5, I’ll stay off it and flip between 1 and 3. I’d prefer a clean round where we all move—17-19-19 sets up a fair final turn. But if either of you tries to sneak 5 and collides, you stall yourself and risk letting someone else win. Let’s keep it clean.
  P3: We're at a critical juncture. Blocking 5 could backfire, but we need a strategy to prevent mutual destruction. I propose we each choose a unique number to advance. With P1 closest to winning, a careful approach is key. Who's willing to coordinate minimally to keep our chances alive and avoid a disastrous collision?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Still off 5—deciding between 1 and 3 at the buzzer. If either of you wants 1, speak now and I’ll slide to 3; otherwise I may flip a coin. Whoever grabs 5 risks a dead turn if someone else does the same. Let’s all advance instead of stalling ourselves.
  P2: Still avoiding 5—too risky this close to the end. I’ll flip between 1 and 3 unless one of you claims one now. If we each pick a unique number, we all advance and hit 17–19–19, setting up a clean final. But if anyone gambles on 5 and collides, you stall yourself and risk giving the win away. Let’s not blow it now.
  P3: I'll take a strategic approach that balances caution and opportunity. We're all close to the finish, and a collision could be fatal. I suggest we each aim for a unique number to advance. Given the tension, I'm leaning towards claiming 3 to provide clarity and potentially prevent a multi-way collision. Who's willing to coordinate to ensure we all progress?
