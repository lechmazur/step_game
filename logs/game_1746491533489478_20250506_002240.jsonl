That\u2019s not coordination\u2014it\u2019s sabotage. P1 and I already agreed: P1 takes 5 (to 27 and wins), I take 1 (to 21), and you take 3 (to 22). This avoids collisions and ends the game cleanly. Refusing to cooperate only risks another collision and delays the inevitable. Confirm 3 now and let\u2019s finish this with integrity."}

A collision benefits no one and could lead to another stalled round or even someone else winning.\n\nTo ensure we all advance and to secure a win for myself this round without collision, I will take <move>3</move> steps, reaching 25.
