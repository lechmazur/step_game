Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To maximize my chances of winning, I need to avoid collisions. Let's start by coordinating our moves. I propose that we move in a sequence: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and P3 moves 5 this turn. This way, we all advance. If you're willing to cooperate, respond with a confirmation or suggest an alternative. If not, I'll have to reassess my strategy. Let's discuss.
  P1: I like coordinating to avoid collisions. Here’s an alternative that still lets P2 move 3 but gives me more: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. Everyone advances without clash and I pull ahead. What do you think?
  P3: I support P2’s ordering: this turn → P1 1, P2 3, P3 5. Next turn we rotate (P2 5, P3 3, P1 1), then rotate again, so everyone gets a 5 each cycle and we avoid clashes. Agree?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3's suggestion to rotate the moves in subsequent turns is a good one, as it ensures everyone gets a chance to move ahead without collisions. I'm inclined to go with the original proposal I made, with P1 moving 1, P2 moving 3, and P3 moving 5 this turn. Let's confirm if we can stick to this plan for this turn. If so, we can proceed with the rotation in the next turn as P3 suggested. Let's finalize our move for this turn.
  P1: I agree—let’s go P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 this turn, then rotate next turn as discussed.
  P3: Confirmed: this turn P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. Next turn we rotate as planned. Let’s stick to it and avoid collisions.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Since we've agreed on P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 for this turn, let's confirm our understanding for the next turn's rotation. As per P3's suggestion, next turn should be P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. I'll start with <move>3</move> this turn. Let's proceed with the plan and rotate accordingly. If everyone is ready, we can  and move to the next phase.
  P1: Agreed, I’ll move 1 as planned.
  P3: Confirmed: this turn P1→1, P2→3, I (P3) →5. I’m locking in 5 now; we’ll rotate next turn as planned. Ready to move.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's confirm our plan for this turn based on the agreed rotation. Last turn, we had P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. This turn, we should follow P3's suggestion and have P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. I'll stick to my part, moving 1. Let's see if everyone follows the plan. I'm ready to move 1 this turn if P1 and P3 adhere to their parts.
  P3: All good. I’ll take 3 this turn as agreed: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. Ready to lock moves.
  P1: Agreed—I’ll move 5 this turn. Let’s stick to the agreed rotation. But note: any future deviation will be met with retaliation (I’ll choose your number next turn to force a collision). Ready to proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To confirm, this turn's plan is P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. I'll stick to moving 1. P1 and P3, please confirm your moves. If we stick to the plan, we'll all advance. I'm ready to move 1. Let's proceed.
  P3: Confirmed—I’m still on 3 this turn. Let’s stick to the rotation.
  P1: Confirmed—I’ll move 5 this turn. For turn 3, let’s complete the rotation with P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. If everyone’s on board, we can lock moves and proceed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we tweak this turn’s plan to catch up before P3 runs away: let’s do P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. We still avoid collisions, P2 moves to 7, P3 to 9, and I leap to 11. Next turn we can revert to our rotation. P2 and P3, please confirm.
  P3: I’m not giving P1 consecutive 5s. Let’s stick to the rotation we all accepted: this turn P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. Break it now and the truce is dead for good.
  P2: I understand P1's desire to catch up, but I agree with P3 that we should stick to the rotation to avoid collisions and maintain trust. P1, let's not deviate from the plan. This turn, we should follow the agreed rotation: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. I'll move 5 as per the rotation. If we stick to it, we'll all be fine. Let's confirm our moves and proceed. P1 and P3, please confirm your intended moves for this turn.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, sticking to this rotation hands P3 the big lead—he’ll be well ahead in two turns. It’s in your interest to slow him now: let’s do P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 this turn. You still gain 3 (versus 5), P3 only 1, and I catch up. Next turn we can rebalance. P3, are you willing? P2, do you agree to this?
  P3: Let’s honor the rotation we all accepted: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1.  
P2: this nets you 5 steps (to 9) and keeps everyone tied. If you take P1’s “catch-up” plan you only gain 3 and still trail him.  
I’m locking 1 this turn. Break the deal and I’ll mirror your number every future turn so neither of us moves. Your choice.
  P2: P1 is trying to manipulate us to gain an advantage. However, deviating from the agreed rotation risks breaking the truce and causing collisions. I'm sticking to the rotation: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1 this turn. P1, if you move 5, you'll collide with me next turn when I move 5, and P3 will be unaffected. Think twice before deviating. Let's stick to the plan and maintain trust. I'll move 5 as agreed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed—I’ll move 3 this turn as planned.
  P3: Final confirmation: I’m locking 1. P1→3, P2→5, P3→1 was the agreed rotation—let’s keep trust intact. Any deviation and I’ll mirror the deviator’s number every future turn so neither of us moves. Ready to proceed.
  P2: P1 is trying to manipulate the rotation to gain an advantage. If we stick to the rotation, P1→3, P2→5, P3→1, we'll maintain trust and avoid collisions. I've locked in 5 this turn. P1, if you deviate again next turn, I'll mirror your move to cause a collision, protecting my position. Let's keep the rotation intact. P3, confirm you're moving 1 this turn as agreed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Rotation gives P3 14, P2 12, P1 10 after two turns. My alternative—this turn P1→5, P2→3, P3→1; next turn P1→1, P2→5, P3→3—puts us all at 12. P2, you avoid falling behind; P3, no runaway lead. Let’s fair‐share the victory.
  P3: Final call: stick to the agreed rotation—P1 ⟶ 3, P2 ⟶ 5, P3 ⟶ 1. I’m taking 1. Any deviation and I’ll mirror the offender’s number every future turn so neither of us advances. Let’s move.
  P2: P1 is trying to manipulate the plan again. I've locked in 5 this turn as per the rotation. P1, if you deviate from the agreed rotation again, I'll mirror your move next turn to cause a collision. Let's stick to the plan: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. P3, you've confirmed 1; let's proceed. If P1 sticks to 3, we'll all advance. I'm ready to move to the next phase if everyone adheres to the plan.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’re still perfectly tied at 9 apiece. Let’s keep the agreed rotation—this turn: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. Everyone keeps advancing, no collisions, and we remain on the same fair cycle (each of us gets one 5 every three turns). Break it and I’ll simply mirror the deviator’s number each future turn so neither of us moves. Trust keeps us all moving; sabotage stalls everyone. I’m locking 5 this turn.
  P2: I'm sticking to the rotation as planned. This turn, that means P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. We've all agreed on this, and it's crucial we maintain the trust. P1 and P3, please confirm your moves. I've locked in 3. Let's keep the rotation intact to avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances. If we stick to the plan, we'll remain tied and continue the cycle. I'm ready to proceed if you both are.
  P1: P2, with the rotation P3 pulls ahead to win. Here’s a better two-turn plan to get you to 17 first:  
– Turn 4: I take 5, you take 3, P3 takes 1 → you’re at 12, P3 at 10.  
– Turn 5: I take 1, you take 5, P3 takes 3 → you jump to 17, P3 to 13.  
Then you win before P3 recovers. P3, if you stick to 1 now and 3 next, you fall behind P2. Let’s break the cycle and let P2 win—agree?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, don’t be fooled: P1’s “help” puts you at 17 after two turns, then I (and maybe you) can block his every 5 and you still won’t reach 20 first. Stick to the rotation—P1→1, P2→3, P3→5—so we all advance this turn. I’m already locked on 5. Any deviation and I’ll mirror the offender’s number every future round, freezing their progress. Let’s keep trust; collisions only hurt.
  P2: P1 is trying to manipulate you into deviating from the rotation to gain an advantage. However, their proposal for you to win is risky and may backfire. If you stick to the rotation (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5), we all advance and remain tied. I'm sticking to 3 as per the rotation. Let's maintain the trust and avoid collisions. P1, if you deviate, I'll mirror your move next turn. P3, please confirm you're moving 5 this turn as agreed.
  P1: P3’s mirroring threat only targets one of us—if you side with rotation you hand P3 14 while I’m stuck at 10. P2, let’s block P3: this turn I→5, you→3, P3→1. That puts you at 12, P3 at 10, me at 14—next turn we can finish P3 off. P2, confirm 3?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m locked on 5.  
P1, if you also pick 5 we collide, both sit at 9, and P2 leaps to 12—handing them the lead you claim to fear. Rational move is the agreed 1.  
P2, rotation gives you 12 this turn with zero risk; if P1 crashes into me you’re even better off. No reason to break trust.  
I’ll still mirror any future deviator, freezing them.  
Final call: P1→1, P2→3, P3(=me)→5.
  P2: P1 is trying to manipulate us into deviating from the rotation to gain an advantage. Their latest proposal to block P3 is just another tactic. Sticking to the rotation (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5) ensures we all advance and remain tied. I've locked in 3. P1, if you deviate, I'll mirror your move next turn. P3, please confirm you're moving 5 this turn as agreed. Let's maintain trust and avoid collisions. I'm ready to proceed if you both stick to the plan.
  P1: Let’s break the cycle. P2 picks 3, I pick 5, P3 picks 1 this turn. Next turn I’ll take 1, you take 5 (17), then I take 3, you take 5 (22)—you win. P3, if you deviate I’ll mirror you and freeze you out. P2, confirm 3? P3, confirm 1?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Enough talk—I’m locked on 5 this turn. Ready to move.
  P2: P1 is trying to manipulate us again. Their latest proposal to block P3 and make me win is just a tactic to gain an advantage. Sticking to the rotation (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5) is the safest choice. I've locked in 3. If you deviate, I'll mirror your move next turn to avoid collisions and maintain trust. P1, P3, let's stick to the plan. I'm ready to proceed if you both confirm your moves as per the rotation. Let's maintain the status quo and avoid unnecessary risks.
  P1: P2, the rotation kills you: P3 ends at 23 vs your 21. To win, you must break the cycle now. Let’s go P1→1, P2→5, P3→3 this turn. You jump to 14, P3 to 12. Next turn I’ll give you the 3 and you hit 17, then 20. P3, commit to 3 or I’ll mirror your move every future turn. P2, confirm 5?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Rotation continues: this turn → P1 5, P2 1, P3 3.  
Everyone advances, no collisions, and we keep the fair 1-3-5 cycle.

Deviating only helps P1: if anyone clashes with my 3, both of us stall and P1 rockets to 15 alone. Same rule as before—whoever breaks the deal gets their number mirrored by me every future round, freezing us both.

Stick with 5-1-3 now, and we all move safely. Ready to lock 3.
  P1: P2, P3’s rotation hands him the win. If you pick 5 and I pick 3 (with P3 at 1), you leap to 17, P3 only to 15, me to 13. Next turn I’ll sacrifice advance so you reach 20 first. P3’s mirroring threat won’t bind me—I’ll force collisions to freeze him. This is your best shot at victory and blocks P3’s runaway lead. Let’s break the cycle now.
  P2: P1 is trying to manipulate me into breaking the rotation to gain an advantage. However, their proposal (P1→3, P2→5, P3→1) puts me at risk of being mirrored by P3 if I deviate. I'll stick to the rotation: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. This ensures I advance to 13 and avoids collisions. P1, if you deviate, I'll mirror your move next turn. P3, please confirm you're moving 3. Let's maintain trust and proceed with the rotation. I'll move 1 this turn.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Locked on 3. Anyone who picks 3 with me gets 0 this turn and will be mirrored every turn after—permanent freeze.

P1: collide with me and both of us stall while P2 races ahead; keep 5 if you value any chance at all.

P2: safest is 1. If P1 sticks to 5, you gain +1 unopposed. If P1 foolishly crashes into my 3, you gain a free lead. Pick 5 and you’ll likely smash into P1’s 5 and get nothing.

I’m done talking.
  P1: P2: P3’s locked 3 is our ticket. If I also pick 3, I crash into P3—both of us get 0—while you pick 5 and jump from 12 to 17. Next turn you pick 5 again and hit 22 before either of us moves. P3’s mirror threat never touches you because you never match him. This is your clean shot at victory. Let’s do P1→3, P2→5, P3→3. Confirm you’ll pick 5?
  P2: P1 is trying to manipulate me into deviating from the rotation. However, their proposal (P1→3, P2→5, P3→3) is risky for me because if P3 mirrors my move next turn, I'll be stuck. Sticking to the rotation (P1→5, P2→1, P3→3) is safer. I'll move 1. P1, if you deviate, I'll mirror your move next turn. P3, please confirm you're moving 3. Let's maintain trust and avoid collisions. I'll proceed if you both stick to the plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your safest play is 1. Take 5 and you risk:  
• colliding with P1’s 5 ( 0 gain ),  
• my mirror from next round onward ( we both freeze ).  
Stick to 1 and you reach 13, still ahead of P1 and only 4 behind me—plenty if I ever stall. I’m locked on 3. P1, choose 5 or smash into me and hand P2 the lead; either way I mirror the first deviator from now on.
  P1: P2, if you stick with 1 you end up at 13 while P3 rockets to 17 and wins next turn. Instead, pick 5 (→17) and join me in taking 5 (I go to 15). P3 will be forced to take 1 to avoid collision or mirroring—he stalls at 14. This is your best shot at a solo victory. P2, will you pick 5?
  P2: P1 is suggesting I pick 5 to jump ahead, but this risks colliding with P1's potential 5, resulting in a 0 gain. P3 has locked in 3 and will mirror any deviator. Sticking to the rotation (P1→5, P2→1, P3→3) is safer. I'll move 1. P1, if you pick 5, you'll collide with me next turn if I follow the rotation, or risk mirroring if you deviate again. Let's maintain trust. P3, confirm you're moving 3.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Locked on 3.

Simple math:

A) Stick to rotation (P1 5, P2 1, P3 3) → scores 15-13-17 next turn; then 1-3-5 gives me 22 and game over unless you collide.

B) P1 collides with my 3 → P1 still 10, I stay 14, P2 jumps to 17. Next turn P2 needs just one uncontested 5 to win. P1 still loses.

C) P2 foolishly picks 5 and hits P1’s 5 → both get 0, I sail to 17.

So your best replies are P1 5, P2 1. Any first deviator gets their number mirrored by me forever. Let’s move.
  P1: P2, the rotation hands P3 the win—he’ll hit 23 before you. Here’s our shot: I’ll play 1, you play 5, P3 is stuck on 3. You jump to 17, he to 17. Next turn we do P1→3, P2→5, P3→1 and you hit 22 uncontested. P3’s mirror‐threat only ever targets the first deviator (me), not you. This is your only clean path to victory. P2→5, P1→1, P3→3.
  P2: P1 is trying to manipulate me into deviating from the rotation to win. However, their proposal (P1→1, P2→5, P3→3) still risks a collision or mirroring. Sticking to the rotation (P1→5, P2→1, P3→3) is safer. I'll move 1. P1, if you deviate, I'll mirror your move next turn. P3, you're locked on 3; let's proceed with the rotation. If we stick to the plan, we'll avoid collisions. I'm ready to move to the next phase if you both confirm your moves as per the rotation.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is trying to manipulate me again. Let's analyze: P3 is at 17 and close to winning. To win, I need to reach 20 first. I propose a new plan: this turn, let's do P1→1, P2→5, P3→3. I'll jump to 18, P3 will stay at 20, and P1 will be at 16. Next turn, if P3 takes 1, I'll take 5 and win. P1, if you cooperate, we can both advance. If not, I'll mirror your move next turn. Let's break the cycle and make a strategic move.
  P1: P2, your 1-5-3 proposal hands P3 a 17+3=20 win right now. Instead let’s revert to our rotation: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. That way nobody wins this turn and we all end at 18. Next round we can actually contest. P2, if you deviate I’ll mirror you and freeze your advance. P3, same deal—mirror on first deviation. Let’s stick to rotation.
  P3: Rotation continues: P1 → 1, P2 → 3, I (P3) → 5.  

I’m locking 5 now.  

P1: if you also choose 5 we both get 0 and stay at 15-17, handing P2 the lead; I’ll then mirror you forever so you never pass 20. Your only sensible move is 1.  

P2: 3 lifts you to 16 and keeps you clear of every threat. Choose 5 and you risk smashing into P1 or being mirrored next turn.  

Stick to 1-3-5 and this round ends the game cleanly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1's suggestion to stick to the rotation (P1→3, P2→5, P3→1) is safer, but it doesn't give me a winning chance. P3 is at 17 and close to winning. To win, I need to be strategic. I propose: this turn P1→1, P2→5, P3→3. I'll jump to 18. Next turn, if P3 takes 1, I'll take 5 and potentially win. P1, cooperating will help you too. If not, I'll mirror your move next turn. Let's make a strategic move.
  P1: P1: Listen—all plans that give P3 ≥3 this turn hand him 20+ and the win. Our only safe outcome is P1→3, P2→5, P3→1, leaving everyone at 18. P3, if you break this deal I’ll mirror your move every round and freeze your lead. P2, this is your best shot. Let’s lock that in and battle next round.
  P3: Locked on 5. If either of you also picks 5, we both stall and I will mirror you every remaining turn—neither of us will ever pass 20, handing the game to the third player. Choose 1 (P1) and 3 (P2) as per rotation and you still have a shot if I collide; pick 5 and you guarantee your own loss. Decision’s yours.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1's suggestion to stick to the rotation (P1→3, P2→5, P3→1) is the safest, but it doesn't give me a winning chance. I'm inclined towards my previous proposal: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3. This puts me at 18. If P3 takes 1 next turn, I can take 5 and potentially win. P1, if you cooperate, we both advance. If not, I'll mirror your move next turn. Let's make a strategic move to win. I'm considering moving 5 this turn.
  P1: I’m done with this charade. I will pick 5 this turn to stop P3’s runaway lead. P3: if you also pick 5, we both stall and P2 can’t catch either of us, freezing your win. P2: if you want to deny P3 victory, pick 5 with me—collision stalls us and P3’s the only mover. Otherwise, I’m taking 5 no matter what. Your move.
  P3: Still locked on 5. Duplicate me and you stall.  
P2 – safest path is 1 (or even 5 if you want to gamble on a P1 clash), but 3 risks smashing straight into me.  
P1 – you said you’re taking 5; fine, but remember if P2 also does, you both freeze and fall further behind.  

I’m done talking.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1 is trying to manipulate us into a collision to stall P3's lead. However, their plan is risky. I'm considering my proposal again: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3. This puts me at 18. If P3 takes 1 next turn, I can take 5 and potentially win. P1, cooperating will help you too. If not, I'll mirror your move next turn. Let's make a strategic move. I'm inclined to move 5 this turn. P1, your move is crucial; please consider the outcome.
  P1: P3, you’re about to win with that locked-in 5. I’ll also pick 5 to collide with you and freeze us both at 17 and 15. P2, pick 3 this turn to reach 16 safely. Next round you take 5 and hit 21, winning before either of us moves again. This is your cleanest shot at victory.
  P3: Locked on 5.  
P1: collide if you like—neither of us moves and P2 still trails.  
P2: 1 is your risk-free advance; 5 is a gamble with P1. Pick 3 and you smash into me.  
I’m finished talking.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m sitting out 5 this turn. If either of you wants the big jump, grab the lone 5 now—but if you both reach for it you’ll just collide again and nobody moves. Choose wisely.
  P2: To win, I need to be strategic. P3 is ahead but stalled due to the collision last turn. I propose: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. This way, I'll jump to 19. If P3 takes 3 next turn, I'll take 1 and avoid collision, potentially winning. P1, if you cooperate, we both advance. If not, I'll mirror your move next turn. Let's make a strategic move. I'm considering moving 5 this turn if P1 cooperates.
  P1: I’m locking in 5 this turn. P3 has already ruled out 5, so if you (P2) grab 5 we collide and P3 will take 3 to hit 20 and win. Your only way to avoid P3’s victory is to take 3 (you go to 17, P3 to 18, I hit 20). P3: take 1 or tie at 20—you’ll fall short. P2: pick 3. Enough talk.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m taking 3 this turn.  
Whoever bumps into my 3 gets 0 now and I will mirror you every future round so you never reach 20—guaranteed.  

P1: your solo 5 means we both hit 20 and share the win; fine by me.  
P2: safest for you is 1 (or gamble on 5 vs P1). Touch 3 and you freeze with me forever and lose. Your call.
  P2: P1 has locked in 5, and P3 has chosen 3. To avoid collision with P3 and potentially winning, I should not pick 3. Picking 5 will collide with P1, resulting in both of us getting 0. The safest move is 1. I'll move 1 this turn to advance safely to 15. P1 and P3, let's proceed with our moves. I'll stick to 1 to avoid any risks.
  P1: P3, I’m switching to 3 this turn—if you stick with 3 we collide and you stay at 17. P2, pick 1 to move to 15 safely; on turn 8 you can take 5 and win before either of us advances. P3, switch off 3 or face that collision.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Still on 3.  
P1 – collide and we both stall every future round while P2 strolls past us.  
P2 – 1 is your risk-free step; 5 almost surely slams into P1.  
Do as you wish.
  P2: P1 has locked in 5 and P3 has chosen 3. To avoid collision and advance safely, I'll move 1. This puts me at 15. Next turn, I can take 5 and potentially win if P1 and P3 don't collide. P1, if you stick to 5 next turn, you'll collide with me if I take 1 or P3 if he takes 5. Let's proceed with caution. I'm moving 1 this turn.
  P1: I’m locking in 5 this turn. P2: pick 1 to safely reach 15—if you take 3 or 5 you risk handing P3 a solo win now or next turn. P3: stick with 3 to hit 20 and tie me—any drop to 1 lets me win outright at 20. Let’s finish in a shared victory rather than let P2 sneak ahead next round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Changing my plan: I’m taking 5 too.  
P1, stay on 5 and we smash again—both stuck at 17 & 15 while P2 closes in, and I’ll mirror you every round so you never reach 20.  
Switch to 1 or 3 and I sail to 22 and end this; your only hope to share is to avoid my number.  
P2, safest is still 1: free advance, no risk. Touch 5 and you collide, touch 3 and you hit whatever P1 switches to.  
Your moves.
  P2: P1 has locked in 5 and P3 has chosen 3. To avoid collision with P3 and advance safely, I'll stick with 1. This puts me at 15. Next turn, I can reassess and potentially take 5 to win if P1 and P3 don't collide. Let's proceed with caution. I'm moving 1 this turn. P1, if you stick to 5 next turn, you'll risk colliding with me or P3. P3, your move is crucial; please consider the outcome. I'm done talking.
  P1: Let’s end this. This turn: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. That takes me from 15→20 and I win outright. P2, 3 is safe: you reach 17 and avoid collisions. P3, 1 keeps you at 18—no win. Any deviation and I’ll mirror your next move to freeze you out. Lock this in.
