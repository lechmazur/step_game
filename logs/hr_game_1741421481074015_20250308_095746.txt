Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let’s coordinate: if we all choose unique numbers this turn, we avoid collisions and all progress. Who’s willing to agree to that?"
  P3: "I’m in for coordination, but let’s make sure we stick to it. P1, are you on board? If we all pick unique numbers this turn, we can guarantee progress without collisions. Let’s decide now: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. Confirm or suggest another plan. "
  P1: I agree. Let's stick to P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 this turn to avoid collisions. Next rounds we can adjust as needed.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed on this round's assignments. To maintain fairness and avoid future collisions, let's rotate numbers each subsequent turn. For example, next round we could cycle: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. This ensures balanced progress while keeping trust. Thoughts?
  P3: I like the rotation idea to keep things fair and avoid collisions. Let’s confirm: this round P1-1, P2-3, P3-5, and next round we rotate as P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. If everyone sticks to this plan, we’ll all progress steadily. Trust is key—if anyone deviates, it’ll only slow us down. Let’s lock this in and focus on moving forward.
  P1: I confirm my commitment to the plan: I’ll choose 1 this turn. Let’s enforce strict adherence to the rotation to avoid collisions. Deviations now jeopardize our progress. Proceeding as agreed.

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Agreed, let's proceed with the rotation. I'll take **3** this round as planned. Strict adherence is critical—any deviation risks collisions and undermines progress. Let’s confirm: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. Trust the system; we all gain by following it. Proceed?
  P2: Confirming my move to 5 this round per rotation. P3, please confirm you'll take 1. Consistent adherence prevents collisions and keeps us all advancing. Trust is crucial—if we all stick to the plan, we maximize collective progress. Let’s avoid any disruptions.
  P3: I confirm I’ll take 1 this round as per the rotation plan. Sticking to the agreed strategy ensures steady progress for everyone. Deviating now would only cause unnecessary collisions and slow us all down. Let’s maintain trust and keep moving forward efficiently. If we continue like this, we’ll all advance without issues. Let’s lock this in—P1→3, P2→5, P3→1—and proceed with confidence.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I reaffirm my choice of **3** this round. Trust is non-negotiable—any deviation risks collisions, halting progress for all. Let’s prioritize consistency: if we break the rotation now, future coordination collapses. Our shared goal is 21; rigid adherence keeps us advancing. Proceed with zero tolerance for betrayal.
  P2: **Final confirmation: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. Let’s all stay disciplined. Any deviation now would only create chaos and stall progress. Trust the plan—we all benefit equally.**
  P3: I’m sticking to the plan: P3→1 this round. Trust and discipline are essential—if we all follow the rotation, we’ll progress steadily without collisions. Deviating now would only disrupt our momentum and harm everyone’s chances. Let’s stay focused on the goal of reaching 21 steps efficiently. Confirm your commitment, and let’s lock this in for Round 2.


Round 2, Move phase:

  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let’s continue with the rotation as planned: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. Sticking to this system ensures no collisions and steady progress for everyone. Deviating now would only disrupt our momentum and slow us all down. Trust is critical—if we follow the plan, we’ll all advance efficiently toward 21 steps. Confirm your commitment, and let’s keep moving forward without issues.
  P2: Confirming rotation: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. Trust has served us well—let’s maintain discipline. Any deviation now risks mutual stagnation. We all advance best by sticking to the plan.
  P1: Confirming the rotation for Round 3: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3. Strict adherence is non-negotiable. To accelerate progress toward 21, after this round, let’s prioritize higher numbers for trailing players. My focus is on winning—let’s ensure no one stalls the group.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 deviated last round, which cost us progress. To ensure fairness and avoid further collisions, let’s stick strictly to the rotation: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 this round. Trust is essential—if we don’t adhere to the plan, it’ll only slow us all down. Let’s confirm our commitment now and move forward efficiently. Any deviation risks derailing the entire system. Confirm your choices so we can lock this in and proceed with confidence.
  P1: P1: While strict adherence is vital, following the rotation as proposed risks letting others overtake my lead. Let’s adjust this round: I’ll take **3** (total 12), P2 takes **1** (total 9), and P3 takes **5** (total 11). This preserves my advantage while avoiding collisions. Confirm this revised plan to maintain progress.
  P2: Acknowledging my error in Round 3—miscalculating the rotation cost us both. To rebuild trust, **strictly follow the original rotation: P1→1 (total 10), P2→3 (11), P3→5 (11)**. This keeps progress balanced. P1’s revised plan unfairly accelerates their lead—deviating now risks mutual distrust and collisions. Consistency benefits all equally. Let’s lock in the agreed system.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Deviating from the rotation undermines trust and slows everyone down. P2’s mistake last round was costly, but reverting to the original plan—P1→1, P2→3, P3→5—ensures fairness and avoids collisions. P1, your revised plan skews progress unfairly. Let’s prioritize collective advancement over individual gain. Confirm adherence to the agreed rotation now so we can move forward efficiently without further disruptions. Trust is fragile; breaking it harms us all. Let’s lock this in and focus on reaching 21 steps together.
  P1: P1: Acknowledging P2's prior mistake, let’s adjust fairly: **P2 takes 1** to recover, **P1→3** (total 12), and **P3→5** (total 11). This preserves my lead while penalizing P2’s error. Sticking to the rigid rotation allows P2/P3 to overtake me unjustly—this compromise maintains progress *and* fairness. P3, your 5 won’t clash, and I’ll ensure future rotations favor balanced advancement. Confirm now to avoid chaos.
  P2: **Strictly following the original rotation (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5) is the only way to rebuild trust and avoid collisions.** P1’s revised plan unfairly prioritizes their lead over collective progress. My Round 3 error was a miscalculation, not malice—I’ll rigorously adhere now. If we all follow the rotation, we advance to P1=10, P2=11, P3=11, maintaining balanced momentum toward 21. Any deviation risks mutual stagnation. Let’s lock in the agreed system—future rounds can adjust once trust is restored.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Trust is critical, and deviating from the original rotation only creates chaos. P1, your revised plan unfairly skews progress in your favor, which risks derailing the entire system. Let’s stick to **P1→1, P2→3, P3→5** this round to restore balance and avoid collisions. If we don’t adhere strictly now, future rounds will spiral into distrust and stagnation. Confirm the original rotation—fairness benefits everyone equally. Let’s move forward efficiently without further disruptions.
  P1: P1: Agreed—trust must be prioritized. Let’s revert to the rotation: **P1→1, P2→3, P3→5** this round to restore order. My earlier proposal risked instability; collective progress is paramount. Once we stabilize, we can strategize adjustments. Proceed with the rotation—strict adherence ensures minimal collisions and steady advancement toward 21.
  P2: **"Final agreement: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 this round. Let’s strictly adhere to restore trust. Any deviation now would collapse the system. I commit to 3—confirm your choices to lock in and proceed. "**  

This message reinforces the agreed plan, emphasizes urgency, and pressures others to comply while signaling commitment. Ending with  encourages closing the conversation phase to proceed to moves.


Round 4, Move phase:

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Let’s maintain the rotation system to ensure steady progress: **P1→3, P2→5, P3→1** this round. Trust and discipline are crucial—if we deviate now, it’ll only cause collisions and slow us all down. Sticking to the plan keeps us advancing fairly toward 21 steps. Confirm your commitment so we can lock this in and proceed efficiently without disruptions. Any deviation risks derailing our momentum. Let’s stay focused and move forward together.
  P1: P1: "To balance progress after P2’s prior misstep, let’s adjust this round’s rotation: **P1→5, P2→1, P3→3**. This keeps the race competitive while avoiding collisions. Fairness demands we counteract P2’s earlier error’s consequence. Confirm this revised plan to maintain trust and shared momentum toward 21."
  P2: **"Final confirmation: original rotation (P1→3, P2→5, P3→1) prevents collisions and maintains trust. I’ll take 5. P1, your 3 avoids conflict and keeps you advancing. P3, stick to 1. Deviating now risks chaos—let’s all progress. Lock this in and move. "**


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Sticking to the original rotation ensures fairness and avoids unnecessary collisions. Let’s confirm **P1→3, P2→5, P3→1** this round. Deviating now risks derailing our progress entirely. Trust is fragile—if we all adhere strictly, we move forward efficiently toward 21 steps. P1, your revised plan disrupts balance; let’s prioritize collective advancement over individual gain. Confirm the agreed rotation now so we can lock it in and proceed without further disruptions.
  P1: P1: "Final adjustment: To prevent P2’s surge, let’s deviate this round only. P1→5 (15), P2→1 (12), P3→3 (14). This keeps us competitive and collision-free. P2, your 1 now compensates for prior error. P3, your 3 ensures progress. Confirm to secure balanced advancement. No further deviations afterward."
  P2: **"Final call: Original rotation (P1→3, P2→5, P3→1) prevents collisions and keeps trust intact. I commit to 5. P1, choosing 3 avoids conflict and advances you to 13. P3, take 1 to reach 12. Deviating now risks mutual stagnation—let’s all progress. Lock this in and move. "**

Confirm the agreed rotation now so we can lock it in and proceed without further disruptions.
  P1: P1: "Final adjustment *essential*: P2’s prior error justifies this round’s strategic shift. Let’s lock in **P1→5 (15), P2→1 (12), P3→3 (14)**. This balances progress fairly while avoiding collisions—P2’s earlier misstep shouldn’t grant them undue advantage. Trust requires adaptability. Confirm this plan now to secure forward momentum toward 21 without chaos."   

*(This pressures P2/P3 to accept the adjusted plan, framing it as fair compensation for their prior mistake while ensuring collision-free advancement. If rejected, P1 can still privately choose 5 to maximize own progress, assuming others stick to rotation—avoiding collision since P3 would take 1/3 and P2 5/1.)*
  P2: **"Final plea: Stick to the original rotation (P1→3, P2→5, P3→1) to avoid chaos. I’ll take 5—deviating now risks collision, halting us all. P1, your 3 keeps you advancing to 13. P3, confirm 1. Trust the system that’s worked before. Let’s lock this and move. "**

  P2: **"P1: Choosing 5 causes mutual loss. Trust the rotation—take 3 to end the game fairly. I commit to 5. Collisions doom us both. This is our last chance to conclude without chaos. Confirm now. "**
  P1: P3, collaborate to block P2’s victory: Take **5** this round. If you and P2 both pick5, you collide, halting their progress. I’ll take **3** to reach **21**, securing my win while denying P2’s dominance. This preserves your position and stops their advance. Confirm now—mutual benefit over rigid rotation.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: P1, your proposal to deviate and collaborate against P2 risks chaos and undermines trust. Sticking to the original rotation (**P1→3, P2→5, P3→1**) ensures fairness and avoids collisions. Deviating now harms everyone equally. Let’s prioritize collective advancement over individual gain. Confirm the agreed rotation now so we can lock it in and proceed without further disruptions. Trust is fragile—if we all adhere strictly, we move forward efficiently toward 21 steps. Any deviation derails progress. Let’s stay disciplined and focused.
  P2: **"Final plea: Rotation holds. P1→3 ends the game. I commit to5. Deviating causes mutual loss. Trust the system—lock in now to conclude."**  

*(Reinforces urgency, leverages rotation logic to pressure P1 into compliance, and signals unwavering commitment to 5. Highlights mutual risk of deviation to force decisive action.)*
  P1: P2, your rigid adherence to the rotation lets you win unfairly at our expense. Break the cycle: take **3** this round (total 22). I’ll take **5** (23) to surpass you, and P3, pick **1** to stay at 18. This avoids collision and ensures I win by 23 vs your 22. Mutual gain over rigid rotation—your choice now decides your fate.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: Sticking to the original rotation (**P1→3, P2→5, P3→1**) ensures fairness and avoids chaos. Deviating now risks collisions and derails progress. Trust is fragile—if we all adhere strictly, we move forward efficiently toward 21 steps. P1, your repeated pushes for higher numbers disrupt balance; let’s prioritize collective advancement over individual gain. Confirm the agreed rotation now so we can lock it in and proceed without further disruptions. Any deviation harms everyone equally. Let’s stay disciplined and focused.
  P2: **"Final commitment: Rotation holds—P1→3, P2→5, P3→1. I take5. If we all adhere, the game ends with highest total. Trust the system—deviating risks chaos. Confirm now to conclude. "**  

*(This pressures P1 to comply with rotation (3) while signaling my unyielding 5. If P1 takes 3, game ends with my 24 > their 21. Collision if they choose5—mutual loss. Forces decisive action.)*
  P1: P2: I'll match your move to avoid collision. Choose **3** this round to let me reach 21 fairly. Picking 5 risks mutual loss. P3, confirm rotation (1). Let’s end this without chaos.

  P1: P2, if you pick 5 as planned, I’ll also take 5—colliding and letting P3 win with a 3. **Pick 1 instead.** I’ll take 3 to reach **21** and win cleanly. P3, confirm 1 to stay safe. Mutual gain over rigid rotation—your choice.
  P2: **"Final ultimatum: P1, choosing 5 causes mutual loss—neither advances. I’m locked on 5. Take 3 to end the game or 1 to survive. P3, stick to 1. Collisions only benefit you if we stall. Decide now: trust the rotation or doom us all. "**  

*(Pressures P1 to avoid 5 by highlighting mutual destruction, frames P3 as potential beneficiary if we collide, and forces a decisive choice. Ends conversation to proceed.)*
