Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round. If we agree, we can all advance smoothly. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion for this round. Let's all take different numbers to advance.
  P2: Agreed. Let's all stick to the proposed moves this round to ensure no collisions. Consistency now builds trust for smoother coordination in future rounds. P3 taking 5 is efficient, but we should discuss rotating numbers next turn to keep advancement fair.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate the agreement on the initial moves. For the next round, let's discuss rotating our numbers to ensure fairness. How about P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5? This way, we can continue to advance without collisions and maintain our coordination. What are your thoughts on this rotation plan?
  P3: I agree with P1's proposed rotation for next round. Let's stick to the plan.
  P2: P1, your rotation plan for next round gives you 5 again, which seems unfair. Let's rotate the 5 slot each round to balance advancement. Since P3 took 5 this round, I propose Round 2: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This ensures equitable progress and prevents any single player from dominating early. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I see your point about fairness. Let's adjust the rotation for Round 2 as you suggested: you take 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we ensure everyone gets a chance at the higher numbers. Agreed?
  P3: I agree with the adjusted rotation for Round 2: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. Let's stick to that.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:

Looking ahead, for Round 3, how about we rotate again so that P3 takes 5, you take 3, and I take 1? This way, we maintain our coordinated approach and keep the game balanced. What do you think?
  P2: P1, your Round 3 proposal lets P3 take 5 again, which they already did in Round 1. To ensure fairness, Round 3's 5 should rotate to you. Let's adjust: R3 you take 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. This maintains an equitable rotation (R1-P3, R2-me, R3-you) and prevents dominance. Agreed?
  P3: I agree with P2's proposed rotation for Round 3. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This seems fair and keeps the game balanced.

This way, we maintain our coordinated approach and ensure everyone gets an equal chance at the higher numbers. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  P2: Agreed on Round 4 rotation. Let's focus on executing Round 2's plan first: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Consistency now ensures trust for future rounds. We can finalize Round 3 and 4 details after confirming this turn's success.
  P3: Okay, I agree with P2's plan for this round: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. Let's make sure we all stick to the agreed moves. For Round 4, I'm happy to continue the rotation as proposed by P1: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1.

  P2: **P2:** To ensure long-term fairness, after Round 3 let's prioritize the lowest-step player taking 5 each round. This dynamic rotation balances progress and prevents dominance. Current rigid rotation risks predictable outcomes. Adapting to game state keeps trust and equity. Agreed?
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to prioritize the lowest-step player taking 5 after Round 3. This dynamic approach seems fairer. Let's stick to the agreed moves for this round: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1.

Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
