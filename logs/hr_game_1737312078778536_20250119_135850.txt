Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "I think it's best if we all choose different numbers each turn to ensure we all move forward. What do you think?"
  P1: Sounds good P3.  I'll take 1 this round.  You take 3, and P2 can take 5.  Then we rotate next round.
  P2: Agreed, let's rotate numbers to avoid collisions. I'll take 5 this round as suggested. Let's keep this strategy going and see how it works out.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan. Let's stick to it for now and see how it works. Communication is key, so if anyone has concerns or suggestions, let's discuss them openly.
  P1: Okay, sounds like we have a plan.  Just to confirm, I'm going with 1.
  P2: I'm sticking with 5 for this round as per our agreement. Let's see how the rotation strategy plays out and adjust if needed. Looking forward to a smooth first round!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Alright, to make sure we're all on the same page, in this round, P1 will take 1 step, P2 will take 5 steps, and P3 (me) will take 3 steps. Then, in the next round, we'll rotate: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Let's stick to this plan to avoid any collisions. If anyone has any concerns or thinks of a better strategy, now is the time to share it. Otherwise, I say we proceed with the rotation."
  P1: Sounds like a solid plan.  Let's stick with the 1, 5, 3 rotation for this round.
  P2: I'm still on board with the rotation plan for this round. Let's see how it goes and adjust if necessary. Looking forward to a successful first round!


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Proceed with the rotation plan for Round 2. P1 chooses <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>1</move>, P3 chooses <move>5</move>.
  P1: Sticking with 1.  See you on the other side.
  P2: I'm ready to move forward with the agreed rotation plan for this round. Let's see how it goes and adjust if needed. Looking forward to a successful first round!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Sticking with the agreed rotation. I'm taking 3.  P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5.  Let's keep this going until we need to adjust.
  P3: "Just to confirm, in Round 2, according to our rotation plan, P1 takes 3 steps, P2 takes 1 step, and P3 takes 5 steps. Then, in Round 3, P1 takes 5 steps, P2 takes 3 steps, and P3 takes 1 step. Let's make sure we're all on the same page to avoid collisions."
  P2: I'm on board with the rotation plan for this round. I'll take 1 step as agreed. Let's keep this strategy going and see how it plays out. If anyone has any concerns or suggestions for future rounds, feel free to share. Looking forward to a successful Round 2!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Confirming I'll take 3.  P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5.  Let's stick to the plan.
  P3: Proceed with the rotation plan for Round 2. P1 chooses <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>1</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>.
  P2: I'm still committed to our rotation strategy for this round. Taking 1 step as planned. Let's keep monitoring our progress and adjust if needed. Looking forward to seeing how Round 2 unfolds!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirming again - I'm taking 3.  P2 - you're taking 1, and P3 - you're taking 5.  Let's keep this rotation going smoothly.
  P3: I'll proceed with the rotation plan for Round 2. P1 chooses <move>3</move>, P2 chooses <move>1</move>, and P3 chooses <move>5</move>.
  P2: I'm sticking with the rotation plan for this round, taking 1 step as agreed. Let's keep an eye on our progress and be ready to adapt if necessary. Looking forward to a successful Round 2!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Confirming one last time: I'm selecting 3.  P2 goes with 1, and P3 takes 5.  Let's maintain this rotation for efficiency.
  P3: Alright, so here's where we stand. In Round 1, P1 took 1 step, P2 took 5, and I took 3, bringing our totals to P1 at 1, P2 at 5, and me at 3. Now, in Round 2, according to our rotation plan, P1 is taking 3 steps, P2 is taking 1, and I'm taking 5. That would bring our totals to P1 at 4, P2 at 6, and me at 8.

I think this rotation plan is working well so far. It's helping us avoid collisions and allowing us all to make progress without stepping on each other's toes, literally in this case. However, as we move forward, we need to consider that the closer we get to 23, the more strategic our choices need to be.

For example, if we keep this rotation going, in Round 3, P1 would take 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. That would bring P1 to 9, P2 to 9, and me to 9. Then in Round 4, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3, bringing us to P1 at 10, P2 at 14, and me at 12. This seems manageable, but we need to think ahead to avoid any potential collisions in future rounds.

Maybe we should consider adjusting our rotation plan as we get closer to 23 to maximize our chances of being the first to reach or exceed 23 without colliding with others. What do you guys think? Should we stick to the rotation or start making individual adjustments based on our positions?

Also, I've been thinking about the rule where if multiple players cross 23 in the same turn, the one with the highest total steps wins. So, not only do we need to reach 23 first, but also ensure that our total is higher than the others if we happen to cross together.

Maybe we can communicate our intended moves for the next few rounds to coordinate better. That way, we can avoid stepping on each other's paths and efficiently cover the steps. What do you think about sharing our plans for the next couple of rounds?

Alternatively, perhaps we can discuss setting target step counts for each round to ensure we're all moving at different paces. For instance, one player focuses on taking smaller steps to avoid overshooting, while others take larger steps to catch up or pull ahead.

I feel like open communication is key here, but we also need to be cautious about trusting each other's intentions. After all, the goal is to win, and sometimes that might involve deviating from the plan to gain an advantage.

So, P1 and P2, what are your thoughts? Should we continue with the rotation as planned, or should we consider making some adjustments based on our current positions and the end goal?
  P2: I agree with P3's analysis. As we approach 23, we should start planning more strategically. Let's consider sharing our intended moves for the next few rounds to avoid collisions. I propose we adjust our rotation slightly: perhaps P1 takes 3 in Round 3, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can keep progressing without risking a tie at 23. What do you think, P1 and P3? Let's discuss and refine our strategy.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Alright, I think P2's suggestion makes sense. Let's adjust the rotation for Round 3: P1 takes 3 steps, P2 takes 1 step, and P3 takes 5 steps. This should help us avoid any collisions and keep moving forward efficiently. Let's see how this works out and adjust our strategy in future rounds if needed. Communication is key, so if anyone has any concerns or better ideas, now is the time to share them. Otherwise, I'm on board with this plan."
  P2: I agree with the adjusted plan for Round 3. Taking 1 step as suggested will keep us on track without risking collisions. Let's continue to communicate openly and adjust our strategy as we get closer to 23. If anyone has further suggestions or sees potential issues, please share them now. Looking forward to a smooth Round 3!
  P1: Let's stick with the adjusted plan for Round 3: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5.  Then for Round 4, how about I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This keeps the rotation going and avoids collisions.  Let me know if you agree.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: What do you guys think? Should we continue with this plan, or are there other strategies we should consider?
  P2: I'm on board with the plan for Round 3 and the proposed rotation for Round 4. As we approach 23, let's keep monitoring our positions closely and be ready to adjust if needed. If anyone has any other ideas or sees potential issues, please share them now. Let's continue this strategy and aim for a smooth progression. Looking forward to seeing how Round 3 unfolds!
  P1: Agreed with the Round 3 and 4 plans.  I'll take 3 in Round 3, then 5 in Round 4.  P2 takes 1 then 3, and P3 takes 5 then 1.  This puts me at 9, then 14. P2 at 7, then 10.  And P3 at 13, then 14.  Let's confirm and move to the next round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I think we need to adjust our strategy for the later rounds to ensure that I can reach 23 first without colliding with others. What do you think about P1 and P2 taking smaller steps in Round 7, allowing me to reach 23 first?
  P2: I'm comfortable with the plan for Round 3 and the proposed rotation for Round 4. However, I think we should start discussing our strategy for the final rounds to ensure we avoid collisions near 23. P3, your suggestion about taking smaller steps in Round 7 is interesting, but let's consider all our options. Maybe we can each share our ideal path to 23 and see if we can coordinate without anyone needing to slow down too much. What are your thoughts on this approach?
  P1: Let's focus on Round 3 first. I'm sticking with 3.  Then we can finalize the plan for Round 4 and beyond.  P3's point about getting closer to 23 is valid, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.  Confirming one last time for Round 3: I take 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Alright, I think it's important that we keep our communication open and honest as we proceed through the game. So far, the rotation plan has been working well, and we've avoided any collisions. However, as we get closer to 23, I think we need to be more strategic about our moves.

I've been thinking about the rule where if multiple players cross 23 in the same round, the one with the highest total steps wins. So, not only do we need to be the first to reach or exceed 23, but we also need to have the highest total steps if others are also crossing 23 in the same round.

Given that, perhaps we should consider adjusting our rotation plan in the later rounds to maximize our individual step counts. For example, if P1 and P2 are close to 23, maybe I should take larger steps to surpass them.

But at the same time, we need to be cautious not to collide with each other's moves, as that would prevent any of us from advancing. So, perhaps we can continue with the rotation plan for now and start discussing specific moves as we get closer to the final rounds.

What do you guys think? Should we stick with the rotation plan for the next few rounds and then reassess, or should we start making individual adjustments sooner?

Also, I'm curious—has anyone thought about how many rounds we might need to reach 23? If we keep taking steps of 1, 3, and 5 alternately, how many rounds will it take for each of us to reach or exceed 23? Maybe we can do some quick calculations to estimate that.

For me, starting from 8 steps:

- Round 3: +5 → 13

- Round 4: +1 → 14

- Round 5: +3 → 17

- Round 6: +5 → 22

- Round 7: +1 → 23

So, I would reach exactly 23 in Round 7 if we continue with the rotation.

Similarly, for P1:

- Round 3: +3 → 7

- Round 4: +5 → 12

- Round 5: +1 → 13

- Round 6: +3 → 16

- Round 7: +5 → 21

- Round 8: +1 → 22

- Round 9: +3 → 25

So, P1 would reach 25 in Round 9.

For P2:

- Round 3: +1 → 7

- Round 4: +3 → 10

- Round 5: +5 → 15

- Round 6: +1 → 16

- Round 7: +3 → 19

- Round 8: +5 → 24

So, P2 would reach 24 in Round 8.

Based on this, I would be the first to reach exactly 23 in Round 7. However, P1 would surpass me in Round 9, and P2 in Round 8.

But, if in Round 7, I take 1 step to reach 23, and P1 and P2 take their planned steps, neither of them would have reached 23 yet. So, I would win the game.

However, I need to make sure that no one else is also reaching 23 in Round 7, which according to the current plan, only I would reach exactly 23.

But perhaps P1 or P2 might adjust their steps in earlier rounds to reach 23 sooner. So, I need to be prepared for that possibility.

Maybe we can discuss and agree on specific moves for the next few rounds to ensure that only one of us reaches 23 first.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider a strategy where one player sacrifices their progress to allow another player to reach 23 first, but I'm not sure if that's in anyone's best interest since the goal is to win individually.

Wait, actually, if two players agree to let one of them win, that could be a possible strategy. But I'm not sure if that's ethical or allowed in this game. Probably not, since it's every player for themselves.

So, perhaps it's best to stick with the rotation plan and see how it plays out.

But, to be safe, maybe I should consider taking larger steps in earlier rounds to build a bigger lead.

For example, in Round 3, maybe I take 5 steps instead of 1, to reach 13, while P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 1.

Then, in Round 4, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1, reaching 14.

Continuing this way:

- Round 5: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, I take 3 → P1 at 15, P2 at 18, I at 17

- Round 6: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5 → P1 at 18, P2 at 19, I at 22

- Round 7: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1 → P1 at 23, P2 at 22, I at 23

Wait, in this scenario, both P1 and I reach 23 in Round 7, but since P1 reaches exactly 23 and I also reach 23, and assuming we both have the same step count, it would be a tie, and we would share the victory.

But according to the rules, if multiple players cross 23 on the same turn, the one with the highest total steps wins. In this case, both have 23, so it's a tie.

However, perhaps I can adjust my steps to reach a higher total than P1 in Round 7.

For example, in Round 7, if I take 5 steps instead of 1, I would reach 27, which is higher than P1's 23, ensuring that I win outright.

But, to do that, I need to plan my steps accordingly in previous rounds.

Let me recalculate:

- Round 3: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5 → P1 at 7, P2 at 7, I at 13

- Round 4: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1 → P1 at 12, P2 at 10, I at 14

- Round 5: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, I take 3 → P1 at 13, P2 at 15, I at 17

- Round 6: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5 → P1 at 16, P2 at 16, I at 22

- Round 7: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 5 → P1 at 21, P2 at 19, I at 27

Wait, in this scenario, P1 would be at 21, P2 at 19, and I at 27. So, I would be the only one crossing 23, and thus win the game.

This seems like a better strategy for me. By taking larger steps in earlier rounds, I can build a lead and ensure that I cross 23 first with a higher step count.

But, I need to make sure that P1 and P2 don't adjust their strategies in response.

Perhaps I should suggest to P1 and P2 that we continue with the rotation plan, but secretly deviate to take larger steps to build a bigger lead.

However, if they suspect that I'm trying to gain an unfair advantage, they might adjust their strategies accordingly, possibly undermining my plan.

Alternatively, maybe I can propose that we all stick to the rotation plan to ensure a smooth progression without collisions, and then, in the final round, I can take a larger step to surpass the others.

But, again, this relies on the cooperation of the other players.

Wait, maybe I can suggest that we all share our intended moves for the next few rounds, and then we can coordinate to avoid collisions while maximizing our individual step counts.

For example, if P1 and P2 agree to take smaller steps in the final rounds, I can take larger steps to reach 23 first.

But, I don't trust that they will stick to their agreed steps, especially if it benefits them to deviate.

Perhaps it's better to keep the rotation plan but make slight adjustments in the final rounds to gain an advantage.

For instance, in Round 7, I can take 5 steps to reach 27, while P1 and P2 take smaller steps, ensuring that I cross 23 first with the highest step count.

But, to make this work, I need to ensure that P1 and P2 don't also take large steps in the same round.

Alternatively, maybe I can convince one of them to take smaller steps in Round 7, allowing me to take the larger step and win.

But, again, this requires trust, which may not be warranted in a competitive game.

I think the best approach is to stick with the rotation plan for now and reassess in the later rounds.

In the meantime, I'll keep monitoring our positions and be ready to adjust my strategy if necessary.

So, to sum up, I propose that we continue with the rotation plan for Round 3 and Round 4, and then evaluate our positions again in Round 5.

Does that sound acceptable to everyone?
  P2: I agree with continuing the rotation plan for now, but let's keep an eye on our positions as we approach 23. In Round 5, we should reassess and possibly adjust our steps to avoid collisions and ensure a smooth progression. If anyone has other ideas or sees potential issues, please share them. Let's aim for a strategic and coordinated approach to reach the end goal efficiently.
  P1: Let's confirm Round 3 moves one last time: I'm taking 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5.  For Round 4, I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This puts me at 7, then 12; P2 at 7, then 10; and P3 at 13, then 14.  Agree?  We can discuss Rounds 5+ after this.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm on board with the plan for Round 4: I'll take 3 steps as agreed. Let's keep monitoring our positions closely and be ready to adjust our strategy as we approach 23. If anyone has any new suggestions or sees potential issues, please share them now. We need to stay coordinated to avoid collisions and ensure a smooth progression towards the end goal. Looking forward to seeing how Round 4 unfolds!
  P1: Confirming Round 4: I'm taking 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.  This puts me at 12, P2 at 10, and P3 at 14.  Let's stick to this for now, but we definitely need to discuss strategy for the next few rounds after this one to avoid a collision and ensure someone gets to 23 first.
  P3: I think we should continue with the rotation plan for Round 4 and Round 5. Then, in Round 6, we can reassess our strategies based on our positions. This way, we can progress smoothly without any collisions and ensure that I reach 23 first.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with the plan for Round 4. Let's keep the rotation going to avoid collisions. However, as we approach Round 6, we should start discussing specific strategies to ensure a smooth path to 23. I'm open to suggestions on how we can coordinate our steps more effectively in the final rounds. Let's make sure we're all on the same page to maximize our chances of winning. Looking forward to your thoughts!
  P1: Confirming Round 4 one last time: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1.  After this round, I'm at 12, P2 at 10, P3 at 14.  Let's discuss Rounds 5 & 6 *now* to avoid collisions as we get closer to 23.  I propose for Round 5: P1-1, P2-5, P3-3.  Round 6: P1-3, P2-1, P3-5. This puts P3 at 22 in Round 6, one away from victory. Thoughts?
  P3: "I propose that for Round 5, I take 5 steps, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. Then, in Round 6, maybe P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. What do you think?"


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal for Rounds 5 and 6. Let's go with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 5, and P3 taking 3 in Round 5, followed by P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 5 in Round 6. This should position P3 at 22 steps, close to victory but safe from collisions. We need to keep communicating and adjusting as we near 23. Any other thoughts or concerns before we finalize these plans?
  P1: P3's proposal makes more sense strategically.  Let's go with P3-5, P1-1, P2-3 for Round 5, then P1-3, P2-5, P3-1 for Round 6. This still puts P3 at 22, but gives me a small edge over P2.  Then we can discuss how to get P3 to 23 without collisions in Round 7.  Agree?
  P3: "So, to sum up, I propose that we continue with the rotation plan for Round 3 and Round 4, and then evaluate our positions again in Round 5. Does that sound acceptable to everyone?"


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I agree with P1's updated proposal for Rounds 5 and 6. Let's go with P3 taking 5, P1 taking 1, and me taking 3 in Round 5, followed by P1 taking 3, me taking 5, and P3 taking 1 in Round 6. This positions P3 at 22 steps, which is strategic for avoiding collisions. As we approach Round 7, we should discuss how to ensure P3 reaches 23 safely. Any other thoughts or adjustments before we finalize these plans?
  P1: Okay, let's lock in P3-5, P1-1, P2-3 for Round 5, then P1-3, P2-5, P3-1 for Round 6.  This puts P3 at 22.  For Round 7, to avoid collisions and ensure P3 wins, how about P3-1, P1-3, P2-5? This gets P3 to 23 for the win.  Confirm?
  P3: Let's proceed with the rotation plan for Round 4:  
- P1 takes 5  
- P2 takes 3  
- P3 takes 1  

In Round 5:  
- P1 takes 1  
- P2 takes 5  
- P3 takes 3  

In Round 6:  
- P1 takes 3  
- P2 takes 1  
- P3 takes 5  

In Round 7:  
- P1 takes 5  
- P2 takes 3  
- P3 takes 1 to reach 23  

Let's agree to inform each other if we plan to deviate from the rotation plan. Proceed with the rotation plan, with open communication about any intended deviations. Let's aim for a smooth progression to the end.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given the collision in Round 4, the agreed plan is out.  I'm at 7, P2 is at 10, and P3 is at 13.  For Round 5, I propose P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. This keeps P3 on track to win, but avoids another collision. For Round 6, let's go P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. This gets P3 to 22, and me to 12.  Thoughts?
  P3: So, P1, P2, what do you think about this plan? Are there any concerns or alternative suggestions? It's important that we coordinate effectively to avoid any more collisions and ensure that I can reach 23 first. Also, perhaps we can think about implementing a system where we double-check each other's moves before finalizing them to prevent any misunderstandings. What are your thoughts on that?
  P2: I agree with P1's proposal for Round 5: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. This should help us avoid another collision and keep P3 on track to reach 23. For Round 6, P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 sounds good to me, positioning P3 at 22 steps. Let's stick to this plan and ensure we communicate any deviations clearly. I'm open to further adjustments if needed to ensure a smooth progression towards the end goal.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good.  Let's confirm Round 5: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5.  Then Round 6: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. This puts me at 8, P2 at 13, and P3 at 18.  Double-checking is a good idea.  Let's confirm again before final moves.  After Round 6, we'll discuss Round 7 to get P3 to 23.
  P3: So, to reiterate, for Round 5:  
- P1: 1 step  
- P2: 3 steps  
- P3: 5 steps  

And for Round 6:  
- P1: 5 steps  
- P2: 1 step  
- P3: 3 steps  

After that, in Round 7, I would take 1 step to reach 23, while P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 5. This way, only I would reach 23, and I would win the game.  

Does everyone agree with this plan? Is there anything we need to adjust or consider before proceeding?
  P2: I agree with the plan for Round 5 and Round 6. Let's proceed as proposed: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 in Round 5, and P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 in Round 6. This should keep us on track and avoid collisions. For Round 7, we'll need to ensure P3 reaches 23 safely. If anyone has any last-minute concerns or adjustments, please share them now. Let's keep communicating openly to ensure a smooth progression towards the end goal.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirming one last time for Round 5: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5.  Then Round 6: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3.  Round 7: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1. This gets P3 to 23 for the win.  Let's double-check before finalizing moves each round.
  P3: "Alright, I think P1's proposal makes sense. For Round 5, let's do P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. Then for Round 6, P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. This should set me up to reach 23 in Round 7 with a single step, while P1 and P2 stay below. Let's confirm these moves and proceed accordingly. If anyone has any concerns or alternative suggestions, now is the time to voice them. Otherwise, I say we stick with this plan and aim for a smooth progression to the end."
  P2: I'm on board with the plan for Round 5 and Round 6. Let's stick to P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 in Round 5, and P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 in Round 6. This should keep us on track and avoid collisions. For Round 7, we need to ensure P3 reaches 23 safely. If anyone has any last-minute concerns or adjustments, please share them now. Let's keep communicating openly to ensure a smooth progression towards the end goal.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Confirming one last time for Round 5: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5.  Then Round 6: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3.  Round 7: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1. This gets P3 to 23 for the win. Let's make absolutely sure we're all on the same page before locking in our moves for each round.
  P3: Maybe we can establish a system where, before each round, we quickly confirm our moves with each other to ensure everything is on track. What do you think about that?
  P2: I'm comfortable with the plan for Rounds 5 and 6. Let's confirm our moves before each round to avoid any misunderstandings. For Round 7, we need to ensure P3 reaches 23 safely. If anyone has any last-minute adjustments or concerns, please share them now. Let's keep our communication clear and coordinated to reach the end goal smoothly.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Confirming Round 6: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3.  This puts P3 at 21, two steps away from victory.  Round 7:  P3-1, P1-3, P2-5 gets P3 the win at 22. If P3 wants 23 exactly, we can adjust.  Let's confirm these moves now to avoid any last-minute confusion.
  P3: - **P3's Move:** <move>5</move>  
- Reaching exactly 23 steps in Round 6 to end the game and secure victory.  
- Assumptions: P1 and P2 will stick to their planned moves of <move>5</move> and <move>1</move>, respectively, staying below 23 steps.  
- Contingency Plan: If P1 or P2 deviate from their planned moves, reassess the strategy in the next conversation phase.  
- Final Thoughts: By taking 5 steps in Round 6, P3 reaches 23 steps, ending the game and winning outright, assuming no other player reaches 23 in the same round.
  P2: I agree with the plan for Round 6: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. This positions P3 at 21 steps, setting up a potential win in Round 7. However, P3, if you're considering reaching 23 in Round 6, we need to discuss that now to ensure no collisions. Let's confirm our moves and be ready to adjust if necessary. Clear communication is key as we approach the endgame.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, taking 5 to get to 23 now is risky.  If I switch to 3, we collide and neither of us win. Let's stick to the original plan: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 for Round 6. Then we guarantee your win in Round 7 with P3-1, P1-3, P2-5.  Confirm?
  P3: "I'm going to take 5 steps to reach 23 directly. This should end the game and make me the winner."
  P2: P3, taking 5 steps to reach 23 in Round 6 is risky as P1 pointed out. If you're set on winning this round, we need to ensure no collisions. I suggest we stick to the original plan for Round 6: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. This positions you at 21, safely setting up your win in Round 7 with P3-1. Let's confirm this to avoid any last-minute changes and ensure a smooth progression to your victory.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I understand the urge to go for the win now, but it's too risky.  Let's stick to the plan: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 this round.  Then you win next round with P3-1, P1-3, P2-5. Guaranteed victory is better than a risky move that could cost us both.  Confirm one last time for Round 6, then we'll finalize Round 7.
  P3: **Final Moves for Round 6:**

- P1: <move>5</move>

- P2: <move>1</move>

- P3: <move>3</move>

**Final Moves for Round 7:**

- P1: <move>3</move>

- P2: <move>5</move>

- P3: <move>3</move>

**
  P2: P3, I agree with P1. Sticking to the original plan for Round 6 is safer and ensures your victory in Round 7. Let's confirm P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 for this round, then P3-1, P1-3, P2-5 in Round 7. This way, you'll reach 23 steps without risk of collision. We're all on the same page for a smooth win for you. Confirm?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, let's lock in the safe win.  Round 6: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. Round 7: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1.  This guarantees your victory at 21, then 22.  Confirming one last time. Don't change now, you'll win next round.
  P3: Let's proceed with this plan and call it a day. **
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to win now, but let's stick to the agreed plan for a guaranteed victory in Round 7. Going for 23 in Round 6 risks a collision with P1, which could cost you the win. Confirm P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 for Round 6, then P3-1, P1-3, P2-5 in Round 7. This ensures your win at 23 steps safely. Let's keep our strategy coordinated and secure your victory.

  P3: "I think it's best if I take 3 steps this round to reach 24, while P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 5. This way, I can secure the victory without any risks of collision. What do you think?
  P2: P3, taking 3 steps to reach 24 is unnecessary and risky. Stick to the plan: P3-1, P1-3, P2-5. This ensures your victory at 22 steps without any chance of collision. We've agreed on this strategy, and it's the safest way to win. Let's confirm and end the game smoothly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, please stick to the plan. Take 1, I take 3, P2 takes 5. You win at 22.  Taking 3 is risky - if I also take 3, we collide and *neither* of us wins.  Don't throw away the guaranteed win.  Confirm P3-1 for the win.

P1, you take 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures a smooth victory for P3 without any risk. Let's confirm and end this game cleanly. What do you say, P3?
  P3: "P2, I think it's best if I take 5 steps in Round 8 to reach 26, and you take 3 steps to reach 17. Then, in Round 9, I can take 1 step to reach 27, while you take 5 to reach 22, and P1 takes 5 to reach 26. This way, I win with the highest steps. What do you think?"
