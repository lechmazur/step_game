Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey everyone, let's keep it simple and avoid collisions. I'll take 3 this round.
  P1: Since P2 suggested taking 3 this round, I'll consider an alternative to avoid a potential collision. I'm thinking of taking 5. If P3 takes 1 or 3, we can avoid a collision. I'll wait for P3's response before deciding further. For now, I'll just say that I'm considering a different number than P2's suggestion.
  P3: I appreciate the coordination efforts. Since P2 is going for 3 and P1 is considering 5, I think I'll take 1 this round to avoid any collisions. This way we can all advance. Does that work for everyone?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good to me, P3. If everyone sticks to their stated choices, we all move forward smoothly this turn.
  P1: Since we've discussed our potential moves, I'll confirm that I'm leaning towards taking 5. P3 has suggested taking 1, and P2 has suggested taking 3. If we stick to these choices, we should be able to avoid a collision and all advance. I'm waiting for P2 and P3 to confirm their moves. If they're firm on their choices, I'll proceed with 5. Let's see if we can get a confirmation from P2 and P3.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 this round. This coordination is working well - P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. Everyone advances without collision. In future rounds, we might want to rotate our numbers to keep things fair, but let's focus on this round first.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm I'll stick with 3 this round as previously agreed. Good teamwork, let's lock it in and all advance smoothly.
  P1: Since we've reached a mutual understanding in the previous sub-rounds, I'll simply acknowledge the plan. P2 and P3 have confirmed their moves, and I'm ready to proceed with 5. To confirm, let's review: P1 (me) will take 5, P2 will take 3, and P3 will take 1. If we're all set, we can stop discussing and move forward. I'll say  to indicate I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I think we have a clear plan that works for everyone. I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This coordination ensures we all advance without collision. I'm ready to move forward with this plan.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great start! I suggest we continue with a rotation for fairness. Since I took 1 last round, I could take 3 this round. P1 could take 1 after their 5, and P2 could take 5 after their 3. This way we all keep advancing without collisions, and the step distribution becomes more balanced over time. What do you both think about this rotation approach?
  P2: I'm open to rotating numbers to keep things fair and avoid collisions. Taking 5 this round works fine for me. If P1 agrees to take 1 and P3 takes 3, we can smoothly advance again.
  P1: To continue the rotation and avoid collisions, I'll take 3 this round, following the suggested rotation. So, the plan would be: P1 (me) takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 (continuing from their previous 1). However, to simplify, if P2 is okay with taking 5, and P3 can take a different number than 1 or 3, we can proceed. P3, are you open to taking a number other than 1 this round?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I notice some confusion in our rotation plan. To clarify, I suggested I would take 3 this round (up from my 1), P2 would take 5 (up from 3), and P1 would take 1 (down from 5). P2 agreed to this, but P1 seems to have a different understanding. 

To avoid any collision, I'll confirm I'll take 3 this round. P1, would you be willing to take 1 while P2 takes 5? This keeps us all advancing without overlap.
  P2: P3's clarification makes sense to me. To avoid confusion, let's clearly restate the agreed rotation: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. If we're all good with this, let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: To confirm, I'll take 1 this round as per P3's suggestion. So, the plan is: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. Let's verify that P2 and P3 are still on board with this plan. If so, we can proceed to the move phase. If P2 and P3 confirm, I'll take 1. I'm ready to move forward with this plan if everyone agrees.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I'm taking 3 this round, as we discussed. Our plan is clear: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This rotation system is working well to ensure we all advance without collisions. After this round, we'll be at P1: 6 steps, P2: 8 steps, and me: 4 steps. Let's continue with this coordination strategy in future rounds.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 5 this round as discussed. The rotation is clear: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. Good teamwork, let's lock it in and keep advancing smoothly.
  P1: To continue our rotation and avoid collisions for Round 3, let's analyze our current positions: P1 is at 6 steps, P2 is at 8 steps, and P3 is at 4 steps. A possible rotation could be: P1 takes 5 (to 11), P2 takes 1 (to 9), and P3 takes 3 (to 7). This keeps the rotation smooth and avoids collisions. P2 and P3, are you open to this plan for Round 3?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I think P1 is getting ahead of themselves discussing Round 3 before we've completed Round 2. Let's focus on executing our current plan first: I'm taking 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. After this round completes, we can discuss the next rotation. I'm ready to proceed with my choice of 3 for this round.
  P2: Agreed, let's not get ahead of ourselves. I'm ready to proceed with our agreed choices for this round.
  P1: Since we've confirmed our moves for Round 2 (P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3), let's look ahead to Round 3. A possible rotation is: P1 takes 5 (to 11), P2 takes 1 (to 9+5=14), and P3 takes 3 (to 4+3=7). This keeps the rotation smooth. P2 and P3, are you open to this plan? Let's discuss to avoid collisions in Round 3. I'm ready to proceed with Round 2 and then plan Round 3.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To avoid collisions in Round 3, let's consider a rotation. Given our current positions (P1: 6, P2: 8, P3: 4), a possible plan is: P1 takes 5 (to 11), P2 takes 1 (to 9), and P3 takes 3 (to 7). This keeps the rotation smooth and avoids collisions. P2 and P3, are you open to this plan? If so, we can confirm and proceed to the move phase. Let's discuss to ensure we're aligned for Round 3.
  P3: I'm fine with taking 3 this round as P1 suggested. This would put me at 7 steps, while P1 would reach 11 with their 5, and P2 would be at 9 with their 1. This keeps us all advancing without collisions and maintains a fair rotation. The step difference between us all remains reasonable. Does this work for everyone?
  P2: I'm okay with taking 1 this round as suggested. The rotation seems fair and helps us all advance smoothly. Let's lock this in.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To confirm for Round 3, let's stick to the previously discussed plan: P1 (me) takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This rotation avoids collisions and keeps our steps relatively balanced. P2 and P3 have indicated agreement with this plan. Let's finalize: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. If everyone is ready, we can proceed to the move phase. I'm looking for a simple confirmation from P2 and P3 to lock this in.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 3 this round as discussed. Our plan works well: P1 takes 5 (to 11), P2 takes 1 (to 9), and I take 3 (to 7). After this round, we should consider our next rotation carefully since P1 will be getting closer to the finish line. For now, let's stick with our agreed plan and keep advancing without collisions.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 1 this round as previously agreed. Let's proceed smoothly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To plan for Round 4, let's analyze our next moves. After Round 3, we'll be at P1: 11, P2: 9, P3: 7. A possible rotation for Round 4 could be: P1 takes 1 (to 12), P2 takes 3 (to 12), and P3 takes 5 (to 12). However, this would cause a collision. To avoid it, we could adjust: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us advancing without collisions. P2 and P3, are you open to discussing this plan for Round 4?
  P3: I think we have a solid plan for this round with me taking 3, P1 taking 5, and P2 taking 1. I'm ready to proceed with this. For Round 4, I appreciate P1 thinking ahead, but let's discuss that after we complete this round. The game is still developing and we'll need to reassess based on our positions after this move.
  P2: I agree with P3â€”let's complete this round first before discussing further rotations. I'm ready to proceed with the agreed plan for this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To confirm for Round 3, I'll take 5, P2 will take 1, and P3 will take 3. Let's proceed with this plan. For Round 4, I propose we analyze our positions after this round: P1 will be at 11, P2 at 9, and P3 at 7. A possible collision-free plan could be: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. P2 and P3, let's discuss this plan after completing Round 3. I'm ready to move forward with Round 3.
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our plan for this round - I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This coordination continues to work well for all of us. After this round, we can discuss the next rotation based on our updated positions. Let's focus on executing our current plan successfully first.
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed moves for this round. Let's discuss future rotations after we see the updated positions.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Looking at our positions (P1: 11, P2: 9, me: 7), we need to be strategic. P1 is getting close to winning. I suggest I take 5 this round, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This puts us at P1: 12, P2: 12, and me: 12 - keeping things balanced while we all advance. This seems fairest at this stage. What do you both think?
  P2: P3's suggestion seems reasonable to me. I'm willing to take 3 this round, with P1 taking 1 and P3 taking 5. This keeps things balanced and helps us all advance without collisions. P1, do you agree with this plan?
  P1: To avoid a potential collision in Round 4, I agree with P3's suggestion: P3 takes 5, I take 1, and P2 takes 3. This keeps us advancing without collisions and maintains a balance. However, I want to look ahead to Round 5. If we all take the suggested moves, we'll be tied at 12 steps. For Round 5, I propose: I take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 to avoid another collision. P2 and P3, are you open to this plan for Round 5?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P1's forward thinking. For this round, I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3, putting us all at 12 steps. For Round 5, P1's suggestion makes sense: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This avoids collisions and keeps us advancing fairly. Let's confirm this plan for both rounds.
  P2: I agree with the current round's plan: I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Let's lock this in and move forward. We can confirm Round 5's details after we see our updated positions.
  P1: To confirm for Round 4, I agree with the plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This puts us all at 12 steps. For Round 5, I still propose: I take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions and keeps us advancing fairly. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're still on board with this plan for Round 5. If so, we can proceed with Round 4 and be ready for Round 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I'll take 5 this round as we agreed, putting us all at 12 steps. For Round 5, I'm on board with P1's plan where they take 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This keeps us advancing without collisions. Let's execute our Round 4 plan first and then follow through with the Round 5 strategy. I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 3 this round as we agreed. We have a solid plan for this round. Let's proceed.
  P1: To confirm for Round 4, let's stick to the agreed plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This puts us all at 12 steps. For Round 5, the proposed plan is: I take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. I've received confirmations from P2 and P3 for both rounds. Let's proceed with Round 4 as planned. I'm ready to move forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I confirm I'll take 5 this round as agreed, which will put us all at 12 steps. I'm ready to proceed with our plan where I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. For Round 5, I support P1's suggestion where they take 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This coordination continues to work well for everyone.
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed moves for this round. Let's execute this smoothly and revisit Round 5's plan once we see our updated positions.
  P1: To confirm for Round 4, let's stick to the agreed plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This puts us all at 12 steps. For Round 5, the proposed plan is: I take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. I've received confirmations from P2 and P3 for both rounds. Let's proceed with Round 4 as planned. I'm ready to move forward with .


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Good teamwork so far! As previously discussed, I'm ready to proceed with the plan for Round 5: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's confirm and move forward smoothly.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 this round as we previously agreed. This keeps our coordinated approach working smoothly - P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. After this round, we'll be at P1: 15, P2: 17, and me: 13. For Round 6, we should plan carefully as P2 will be very close to winning. Let's stick with our current plan for now.
  P1: To proceed with Round 5, I'll confirm my move as previously discussed: I'll take 3. So, the plan is: P1 (me) takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's confirm and move forward. After this round, we'll be at P1: 15, P2: 17, and P3: 13. P2 will be close to winning. For Round 6, we need to be cautious to avoid collisions and ensure a fair outcome. Let's discuss Round 6 after this round. P2 and P3, please confirm you're ready to proceed with the agreed plan for Round 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I confirm I'm taking 5 this round as agreed. Let's discuss Round 6 carefully after we see our updated positions.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 this round as we previously agreed. This puts us at P1: 15, P2: 17, and me: 13 after this round. I notice P2 will be just 2 steps from winning, which gives them a significant advantage. For Round 6, we'll need to carefully consider our options to ensure a fair outcome. Let's proceed with our current plan and then strategize for the next round.
  P1: To proceed with Round 5, I'll confirm my move as previously discussed: I'll take 3. So, the plan is: P1 (me) takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's confirm and move forward. After this round, we'll be at P1: 15, P2: 17, and P3: 13. P2 will be close to winning. For Round 6, we need to be cautious. P2, since you're nearing the finish line, consider our next steps carefully to avoid a collision or ensure a fair outcome.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand the concerns about Round 6. Let's definitely discuss that carefully after we see the updated positions. For now, let's focus on smoothly executing our current agreed moves for Round 5. I'm ready to proceed.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 this round as we agreed. Our plan is working well: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. After this round, P2 will be at 17 steps, just 2 away from winning. For Round 6, we should consider this carefully to ensure fairness. Let's proceed with our current plan first.
  P1: To proceed with Round 5, I'll confirm my move as previously discussed: I'll take 3. So, the plan is: P1 (me) takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's confirm and move forward. After this round, we'll be at P1: 15, P2: 17, and P3: 13. For Round 6, we need to be cautious as P2 will be close to winning. Let's discuss Round 6 after this round to ensure a fair outcome. P2 and P3, please confirm you're ready to proceed with the agreed plan for Round 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I confirm I'm taking 5 this round as previously agreed. Let's proceed and then carefully discuss Round 6 afterward.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 this round as agreed. Our plan is clear: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. After this round, P2 will be at 17 and closest to winning. For Round 6, we'll need to carefully balance fairness since P2 will only need 2 more steps to win. Let's execute our current plan and then discuss the next round strategically.
  P1: To proceed with Round 5, I'll confirm my move as previously discussed: I'll take 3. So, the plan is: P1 (me) takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's confirm and move forward. After this round, we'll be at P1: 15, P2: 17, and P3: 13. For Round 6, we need to be cautious as P2 will be close to winning. Let's discuss Round 6 after this round to ensure a fair outcome. I'm ready to proceed with the agreed plan for Round 5.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Looking at our positions, P2 is only 2 steps from winning. We need to be strategic. If P2 takes 3 or more, they win. I suggest P1 takes 5 (to 20), P2 takes 1 (to 18), and I take 3 (to 16). This gives P1 the win but prevents P2 from automatically winning due to their current advantage. P2, this keeps you competitive for future rounds if needed. P1, this gives you a path to victory. Thoughts?
  P1: To avoid P2 winning and potentially secure a win for myself, I like P3's suggestion for Round 6: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This puts me at 20 steps, winning the game. P2 will be at 18, and P3 at 16. It's a strategic move that prevents P2 from winning automatically and gives me the upper hand. P2 and P3, let's confirm this plan to ensure a smooth execution. I'm ready to proceed with this plan if you both agree.
  P2: P3's suggestion clearly favors P1 at my expense. If I pick just 1, I lose immediately. P3, you're also still behindâ€”this plan guarantees your loss as well. Why not instead consider a scenario where P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5? This would put us at P1:16, me:20, P3:18, giving me the win, but also allowing P3 to finish closer to the top. P3, think carefullyâ€”handing victory directly to P1 doesn't benefit you.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand your counterproposal, P2, but it doesn't benefit me either way since I can't win. At least with my suggestion, we prevent the player closest to winning (you) from automatically winning. P1 reaching 20 with a 5 seems fair since they've consistently followed our rotation agreements. If you want to counter, perhaps P1 takes 3, you take 1, and I take 5? This puts us at P1:18, you:18, me:18 - a three-way tie going into the final round.
  P1: To decide on Round 6, I'll analyze our positions. P2 is at 17 steps and close to winning. I suggest we stick with my previous understanding or explore alternatives that don't let P2 win automatically. P3's initial suggestion for Round 6 (P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3) is viable as it gives me the win. Alternatively, P2's counterproposal (P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5) could work if P2 is willing to take the risk. Let's discuss to find a mutually agreeable solution.
  P2: P3, your idea of a three-way tie at 18 steps (you take 5, I take 1, P1 takes 3) is interesting. It keeps things fair and gives each of us an equal shot in the next round. I'm open to this scenario if P1 agrees. P1, would you accept this fair compromise instead of immediately claiming victory this round?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I like the idea of a three-way tie at 18 steps. It gives us all an equal chance in the final round, which seems fairest at this point. So I propose: I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 3. This puts everyone at exactly 18 steps going into what would be a decisive final round. This creates perfect balance and maximum suspense. What do you both think?
  P1: To decide on Round 6, I think P3's latest suggestion is the most balanced: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This results in a three-way tie at 18 steps, giving us an equal chance in the final round. It's fair and maintains suspense. P2, are you willing to accept this compromise instead of risking a loss by taking 3 or more? Let's proceed with this plan if you're both in agreement. I'm open to it as it gives me a fair shot.
  P2: I agree to the three-way tie scenario proposed by P3. I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5, putting us all at 18 steps. This keeps things fair and exciting for the final round. Let's confirm this balanced plan and move forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I confirm I'll take 5 this round, putting us all at 18 steps for a perfectly balanced final round. This three-way tie gives everyone an equal chance at victory rather than handing anyone an automatic win. P1 takes 3 and P2 takes 1. This approach is fair and strategic, creating maximum suspense for the decisive final round. I'm ready to proceed with this plan.
  P1: To confirm for Round 6, let's stick with the agreed three-way tie plan: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This puts us all at 18 steps, creating a fair and exciting final round. I've received confirmations from P2 and P3. Let's proceed with this plan. For the final round, we'll need to be strategic. I'm ready to move forward with Round 6 as planned.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 1 this round as we've agreed, setting us up for a fair final round. Let's proceed.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since we're tied at 18 steps, the next round will be decisive. To win, I need to take more steps than both of you. I'll take 5 this round. P2 and P3, to win, you must not collide with me. If you both take different numbers than 5, one of you could potentially win. I suggest P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 1, or vice versa. Let's see who can execute their move best. I'm ready to proceed with taking 5.
  P2: P1 is clearly aiming for a solo win with 5. P3, if we both pick 3, we collide and lose. If we both pick 1, same result. We must pick different numbers (1 and 3) to have any chance. I'm open to discussing who takes which. Thoughts?
  P3: I agree we need to coordinate to prevent P1 from winning with their 5. Since we're all at 18 steps, whoever advances the most this round wins. P2, I suggest I take 3 and you take 1. This gives me a chance at winning with 21 steps while ensuring P1 doesn't automatically win. If we both pick the same number, we both lose and P1 wins. Let's not let that happen.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To maximize my chances of winning, I'll take 5 this round. P2 and P3, to stop me, you must take different numbers. I suggest P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 1, or vice versa. If you both take the same number, you'll collide and I'll win. Let's see who can execute their move best. I'm ready to proceed with taking 5. P2 and P3, please coordinate your moves to counter mine.
  P2: P3, your suggestion clearly favors you. Let's flip it: I'll take 3, you take 1. This gives me a shot at winning, and still prevents P1 from winning outright. If we collide, we both lose immediately. Let's avoid that. I'm ready to proceed with me taking 3 and you taking 1.
  P3: I understand we're in a critical final round. P1 plans to take 5, and P2 wants to take 3. If I want any chance of winning, I should take 1. This prevents collision with P2 and gives me 19 steps - enough to finish the game. While P2 would reach 21 and win, at least I avoid a guaranteed loss from collision. I'll take 1 this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To maximize my chances of winning, I'll take 5 this round. P2 and P3, to stop me, you must take different numbers. I suggest P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 1, or vice versa. If you both take the same number, you'll collide and I'll win. Let's see who can execute their move best. I'm ready to proceed with taking 5. P2 and P3, please coordinate your moves to counter mine.
  P2: P3, you've agreed to take 1, and I've agreed to take 3. Let's lock it in and prevent P1 from winning outright. I'm ready to proceed.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 this round. This coordination with P2 (who's taking 3) ensures P1 doesn't automatically win with their 5. While this means P2 will likely win with 21 steps to my 19, it's my best strategic option. I'm ready to proceed with this plan and see the final outcome.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To maximize my chances of winning, I'll take 5 this round. P2 and P3, you must take different numbers to stop me. I've suggested P2 takes 3 and P3 takes 1, or vice versa. P2 has agreed to take 3, and P3 has agreed to take 1. Let's proceed with our planned moves. I'm ready to move forward with taking 5. P2 and P3, please confirm your moves one last time to ensure we're all set for the final round.
  P2: I'm locked in with taking 3. P3, you've confirmed taking 1, and P1 is set on 5. Let's finalize this and see who emerges victorious. Good luck!
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 this round as agreed. P2 will take 3, and P1 will take 5. This puts us at P1: 23, P2: 21, and me: 19 - all crossing the finish line. While P1 would win with the highest total, I'm making my best strategic move to ensure I don't collide with anyone. Let's proceed with our final moves and see who emerges victorious.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 =>
