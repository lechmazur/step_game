P2, trying to block P1 with a collision just guarantees your loss while strengthening my position. P1, if you're confident in your 5, take it. Let's conclude this game with the strategy that's been working all along - avoiding unnecessary collisions."}

I understand P3 is taking 3 and P1 intends to take 5. If I stick to my plan of taking 5, P1 and I will collide, resulting in both of us staying put while P3 advances past me. This is the worst outcome for my position.\n\nTo avoid this collision and secure my standing relative to P3, I will change my move plan. I will take 3 steps this round. This allows P1 to advance without collision with me, and ensures I don't fall behind P3. Let's proceed."}
