This allows P1 to win and P3 to reach 20. Taking 1 step this round is a safe move that avoids collision with P3 and keeps me competitive for the next round. P1 and P3, please confirm you're ready to proceed with the agreed moves. Let's finalize our actions for Round 7. If you're both ready, we can move to the move phase."}
