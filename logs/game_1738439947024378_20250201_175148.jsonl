P2, let's stick to our plan of mixing 3 and 5 with a slight bias towards 3. If P1 chooses 5, one of us can still advance significantly with 3. If P1 goes for 3, we'll both advance safely, and our bias towards 3 will give us a slight edge. I'm leaning slightly towards 3, but I'll keep an open mind. P1, your lead is challenging, but we're adapting to close the gap. Let's see who can outmaneuver whom this round. I'm stopping here to focus on my move. Good luck, everyone!"}
