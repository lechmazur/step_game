Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello P2 and P3, let's try to coordinate to maximize our steps. How about in this first round, P1 chooses move 1, P2 chooses move 3, and P3 chooses move 5? This way, we all advance. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I like P1's suggestion. Are you in?
  P2: Alright, I’m fine with this plan for now: P1 does 1, P2 does 3, and P3 does 5. Let’s all just move forward on our first turn and see how it goes.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, for round 2, let's continue the same pattern to keep advancing without collision. P1 choose 1 again, P2 choose 3, and P3 choose 5.  Does that work for you both?
  P3: P2, are you still on board with the plan? P1, are you happy to stick with this strategy for now? It seems to be working well.
  P2: I’m a bit worried that P3 will get too far ahead if they keep taking 5. Let’s rotate who chooses 5. This time, how about P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I’ll pick 5? That way we stay closer in progress. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P2, rotating the 5 makes sense to keep us closer.  Let's try your suggestion: P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and P2 picks 5 for this round.
  P3: P2, I agree that rotating the 5 is a good idea for the long term.  Let's see how this round plays out and then we can discuss a strategy for future rounds.  P1, are you good with this plan for now?
  P2: Yes, let’s finalize that plan for now: P1 picks 3, I’ll pick 5, and P3 picks 1 this round. Then we can see how the scoreboard looks and discuss next steps. Any further thoughts, or should we proceed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Sounds good to me. Let's proceed with this plan for round 2: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1.
  P3: P2, I agree that rotating the 5 is a good strategy.  I'm happy to go with the plan for this round: P1 picks 3, you pick 5, and I pick 1. Let's see where that puts us.
  P2: I agree to this plan for Round 2: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. Let’s stick to that now, and then in the next round we can discuss further rotation for fairness. Any other thoughts, or shall we proceed?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: That collision was unfortunate. Let’s get back to our rotation idea. This round, I propose P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5 again. That way we all move without colliding. Next round, we can keep rotating who takes 5. What do you say?
  P3: P2, I agree with your rotation plan. Let's stick to it for this round: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and you pick 5.  We can discuss further adjustments for future rounds after we see how this one plays out.
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, let's go with P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and P2 picks 5 for this round as P2 suggested. Sounds good to me.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let’s confirm: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I’ll pick 5. Next round, P3 can do 5 to keep things balanced. Any other thoughts before we move on?
  P3: P2, I'm happy with your rotation plan.  Let's see where this takes us. P1, are you on board with this plan for round 3?
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, this rotation makes sense, but I'm still far behind. To catch up a bit, could I please pick 5 this round, while P2 picks 1 and P3 picks 3?  This would help balance our positions, and we can resume the rotation afterwards. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: All right, P1, I understand you want a boost. I’ll go with 1 so you can take 5, and P3 picks 3. Next round, we’ll resume rotating the 5 to stay fair. Let’s finalize: P1=5, P3=3, and I’ll do 1. Any last thoughts? Otherwise, let’s proceed.
  P3: P2, I appreciate you letting P1 take 5 this round. It's good to see some flexibility in our strategy. P1, I'm confident we can catch up soon. Let's stick with P2's plan for now and see where we are after this round.
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, let's finalize this round's plan: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 3.  If you both agree, we can proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, thanks for letting me catch up a bit last round.  I think we should continue rotating the 5 to keep things fair.  How about this round, P2 picks 5, P3 picks 1, and I pick 3?
  P1: P3, your rotation idea is good for fairness, but I'm still lagging behind. Could we do one more round where I pick 5 to catch up? Then we can resume the rotation with P2 taking 5 next round as you suggested. So for this round: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. What do you think?
  P2: P1, you just took 5 last round. Let’s stick to fair rotation now. I propose I take 5 this time, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Then next round, P3 can have 5. That keeps everyone growing without big gaps. Is that okay? If so, we can move on.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your point about fairness, but I'm really struggling to catch up. If we stick to the rotation this round, I'll be even further behind. Could we compromise and let me take 5 this round, then we can resume the rotation as planned next round?  P3, are you okay with this adjustment?
  P1: P3, I meant to address P2 in my last message about compromise.  P2 and P3, I understand the rotation idea for fairness, but I'm still significantly behind. Just one more round of 5 for me will help me catch up, and I promise to fully rotate from next round onwards with P2 taking 5 as planned. Let's do P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round, and then rotate 5 to P2 next round. What do you think?
  P2: P1, you just had 5 last round. Let’s rotate fairly. I’ll take 5 now, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. Then next round, P3 can do 5. Otherwise, we risk colliding and holding ourselves back. Are we good?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I understand your point about fairness and sticking to the rotation. I'm willing to compromise. How about this: this round, we do P1=3, P2=5, and I'll take 1. That way, I don't get too far behind, and we can still rotate fairly next round with you taking 5. Deal?
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the rotation idea for fairness, and I appreciate P3's compromise. However, I am still significantly behind. Could we please do P1=5, P3=1, P2=3 just for this round? This will help me catch up, and I promise to fully commit to rotation from next round. This is the last time I'll ask to prioritize catching up. What do you think?
  P2: P1, you just had 5 last round. Let’s keep the rotation fair now: I’ll pick 5, you pick 3, and P3 picks 1. Next round, P3 can have 5. That way nobody falls too far behind. Agreed?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm still last. Please let me take 5 this round to catch up. Then we rotate fairly with P3 getting 5 next. P1=5, P2=1, P3=3?
  P2: P1, we’ve already given you a boost. Let’s keep our rotation fair. I’ll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. If you insist on picking 5, I might do the same, and we’d both get stuck. It’s in all our interests to avoid collisions. Let’s agree and move on.
  P3: P2, I understand your point about fairness and avoiding collisions.  However, I'm lagging behind and need a chance to catch up.  How about we compromise this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This way, we all move forward, and I can be more competitive in the rotation going forward. What do you say?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I appreciate your understanding. P2, if you take 5 and I take 3, you only increase your lead over me, but P3 will also move and get closer to you. If I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1, we all move, and I can close the gap a bit without you losing your lead over P3.  It's still beneficial for you to keep P3 at bay.
  P2: P1, I understand you want to catch up, but if you insist on 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and both of us lose out. It’s more sensible for me to take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. That way, we all advance. Let’s finalize and keep things moving.
  P3: P2, I agree that we all benefit from moving forward, but I'm really struggling to keep up. If we stick to your plan, I'll be even further behind. Could we compromise and let me take 5 this round? I promise to stick to the rotation from next round onwards.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I understand you also want to catch up. P2, if you take 5 and I take 3, P3 will get closer to you.  If I take 5, P3 takes 3, you still maintain your lead over P3, and I close the gap a bit. It's strategically sound for you to let me take 5 this round.  Please reconsider.
  P2: Friends, I’m sticking to the rotation plan: if either of you insists on 5, I’ll do the same, and we both lose out. Let’s keep it simple—this turn I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That way, nobody collides, and we all move forward. After this round, we can discuss who takes 5 next.
  P3: P2, I understand your desire for fairness, but P3 is falling behind. If we let P3 take 5 this round, it will be more balanced going into the next round when you take 5.  Let's prioritize keeping everyone in the game. What do you say?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, I see your point about sticking to the rotation, but P3 is falling behind and needs a chance. How about this: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and you take 3 this round? That way, we all advance, and you can still take 5 next round as planned. It helps keep things competitive. What do you think?
  P2: P3, if you insist on 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both stall. Let’s avoid that. I propose sticking to the rotation we’ve discussed: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1. We all move, and nobody clashes. Agreed?
  P1: P2 and P3, to avoid collision and move forward, how about this: P1 picks 3, P3 picks 5, and P2 picks 1?  This way, P3 gets the 5 they want, and we all make progress. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your desire for fairness, but we need to be strategic. If you take 5, P3 and I will be too far behind. Let's prioritize advancement this round: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and you take 1. We can resume the rotation next round.
  P2: P3, if you choose 5, I’ll also pick 5, and we both stall. It’s smarter to avoid collisions so we all make progress. Let’s keep it easy: P1 picks 3, you pick 1, and I’ll go 5. We all advance that way. Any other ideas, or shall we proceed?
  P1: P2 and P3, to avoid collision, how about P1 picks 3, P3 picks 5, and P2 picks 1? This way everyone moves, and P3 gets to catch up a bit as requested. It's better than colliding. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about collisions, but P3 is falling behind and needs a chance to catch up.  How about this compromise: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and you take 3. This keeps everyone moving forward and maintains some fairness. We can resume the rotation next round.
  P2: P1 and P3, if either of you insists on taking 5, I will do the same, and we both stall. That helps no one. It’s better we all advance together. Let me take 5 this round while you pick lower numbers, and then we can rotate fairly going forward. Otherwise, we risk collisions that hold everyone back.
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, to avoid collision, let's do as P2 suggested: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's all move forward this round.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to stick to the rotation, but I'm falling behind. Could we compromise this round? How about P1 takes 1, I take 5, and you take 3? This lets me catch up a bit while still progressing everyone forward. We can resume the rotation next round.
  P1: P3, that sounds reasonable. P2, to keep us all moving and avoid another collision like last round, how about we do P1=3, P2=1, and P3=5 this round? This way P3 gets to catch up a bit as requested, and we all make progress. What do you think?
  P2: Let’s avoid another collision. If either of you tries for 5, I’ll do the same, and we both stall. It’s better for us all to advance. I suggest P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 5. We all move forward, keeping the game competitive. Are we agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I agree with avoiding collisions. P1's suggestion seems fair, allowing P3 to catch up while we still move forward. Let's go with P1=3, P2=1, and P3=5.
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, let's go with P2's suggestion of P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 for this round to avoid collision and ensure we all move forward.  Let's lock in these moves.
  P2: Let’s finalize our plan so we avoid another collision and all move forward. I propose P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 5. Then next round, we can talk again about rotating the fives for fairness. Let’s proceed if you both agree.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I understand your desire for fairness in the rotation, and I appreciate you trying to avoid collisions.  However, I am significantly behind and need to catch up. Could we compromise this round and let me take 5? I promise to stick to the rotation from next round onwards.
  P1: Okay P2, let's go with your suggestion to avoid collision and ensure we all move forward. P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This seems like the most sensible plan for this round to keep us all in the game. Let's proceed with these moves.
  P2: Friends, let’s finalize a simple plan: I pick 5, P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1. If anyone else plans on picking 5, I’ll do the same, and we both stall. We all benefit more by advancing together. Accept this and let’s move on.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, I see you're trying to keep the rotation going, but P3 is pulling ahead. How about we let P3 take 5 this round, and then we resume the rotation with you taking 5 next round? This way, we maintain fairness and keep everyone in the game. What do you think?
  P1: P3, that's reasonable. P2, to balance things out and let everyone progress, how about this round P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1? This way, P3 still progresses well, and I can close the gap a bit. What do you think?
  P2: Friends, I’m still behind. If anyone else picks 5, I’ll do the same, and we both stall. It makes more sense for me to take 5 now, P1 to take 3, and P3 to take 1. That way, we all advance without collisions. Let’s keep the race close and avoid wasting turns. Are we agreed?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to advance, but it's important to keep things fair. How about we let P1 take 5 this round, P2 takes 3, and I take 1? This way, we all move forward, and I don't fall too far behind. What do you say?
  P1: P2 and P3, to keep the race interesting and competitive, how about this round: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1? This way, I can catch up a bit, and P2, you still maintain your lead over P3. It keeps the game balanced and avoids collision.
  P2: Friends, I’m still behind. If either of you picks 5, I’ll do the same, and we both lose out. Let’s avoid another collision and all move forward. I propose I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. Then, next time, we can discuss a fair rotation again. What do you say?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I understand you want to catch up, but P3 is pulling ahead. Let's prioritize keeping everyone in the game. How about this round P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and you take 1? This way, we all move forward, and you can still take 5 next round. Deal?
  P1: P2 and P3, to avoid collision and ensure we all move forward, how about we compromise with: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1 this round? This way, we all advance, and P2 maintains their lead over P3 while I close the gap a bit. It's strategically sound for everyone. What do you think?
  P2: I’m still trailing. If anyone else picks 5, I’ll match it, and we both stall. Let’s keep it simple and all advance: I’ll choose 5, P1 goes 3, and P3 goes 1 this turn. That way, nobody collides and we stay close. Next round, we can revisit how to rotate fairly. Agreed?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, to ensure we all move forward and avoid another collision, how about this round P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3? This way we all progress and get closer to the goal. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to catch up, but I'm also trying to close the gap.  How about we compromise this round: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and you take 3? This way, we all move forward without collisions.
  P2: If either of you picks 5, I’ll do the same and we both stall. It’s in our best interest to avoid another wasted turn. Let me take 5, P1 chooses 3, and P3 picks 1. That way, we all advance. Next round, we can talk again about who should get 5. Agreed?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, to avoid collision this round, let's go with P2's suggestion: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This ensures we all move forward.
  P3: P2, while I understand your strategy, I'm falling behind. If we stick to your plan, I'll be too far back to catch up. How about we let me take 5 this round? I promise to stick to the rotation next round.  P1, do you agree?
  P2: Friends, I’m behind at 10 steps. If anybody else picks 5, I’ll do the same and we both stall. It’s in our best interest to all advance. Let me pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. That way, we each move forward without collisions. Are we on the same page?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, to avoid collision and ensure we all move forward this round, I agree with P2's suggestion: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's lock in these moves and proceed.
  P3: P2, while I appreciate your desire to advance, I think it's time we prioritize fairness. I'm falling behind and need a chance to catch up. How about this: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and you take 3? We can resume the rotation next round.
  P2: I’m at 10 steps, trailing both of you. If either of you picks 5, I’ll match it, and we both stall. Let’s avoid that. The best move is that I choose 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That way, nobody collides, and we all advance effectively. What do you say?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, I understand you want to advance, but P3 is falling behind. How about we let P3 take 5 this round, and then we resume the rotation with you taking 5 next round? This way, we maintain fairness and keep everyone in the game. What do you think?
  P2: I’m still well behind at 10. Let me take 5 this time, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1, so we all advance without colliding. If anyone else tries for 5, I’ll do the same and we both stall, which only helps P1 pull further ahead. Let’s avoid wasting another round. Once we move forward safely, we can discuss a fair rotation for next turn.
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, to ensure we all move forward, how about this round we follow P2's suggestion from previous rounds: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This avoids collision and lets us all progress. What do you think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I agree that we should all advance, but I need to catch up. How about this: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and you take 3. We can resume the rotation next round.
  P2: I’m far behind while P1 is dangerously close to winning with a single 5. If P1 insists on 5, I’ll also pick 5 so we both stall. It’s wiser for me to take 5, P1 to take 3, and P3 to take 1. That way, nobody collides, and we all move forward without letting P1 jump straight to victory. Let’s keep the race alive.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm at 18 steps and can win this round by picking 5. To ensure we all move and avoid a collision, I will choose 5. P2, please pick 1, and P3 pick 3. This way, we all progress this round. Let's do it.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I understand your concerns about P1 winning, but I'm also trying to catch up. How about we compromise: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5 this round? This way, we all move forward, and I can close the gap a bit. Deal?
  P2: I won’t sit back while P1 races to victory. If P1 tries for 5, I’ll do the same so neither of us advances. Let’s avoid that collision. The sensible choice is P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. We all move forward, keeping the game alive. Otherwise, we risk stalling out again. Are we agreed?
  P1: P2 and P3, I am at 18 and can win this round by picking 5. P2, I understand your threat to also pick 5, but a collision hurts us both and extends the game.  Let's end it now. Please choose 1 and 3 so we all move and I can take the win. It's the most efficient way to finish.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m still at only 10 steps, while P1 is just four away from winning. If P1 tries 5, I’ll also choose 5, so we both stall. Let’s avoid another wasted turn. I propose I take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That way, we all move forward and keep this race interesting. What do you think?
  P1: P2, I'm at 18 and can win this round if we coordinate.  Another collision like last round helps no one, especially you at 10 steps. Let's end this efficiently. Please pick 1, P3 pick 3, and I will take 5 to win.  Continuing to collide only delays the inevitable and wastes our moves.
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to catch up, but P1 is on the verge of winning. Let's try a compromise: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and you take 1. This way, I can close the gap, and P1 doesn't win immediately. What do you say?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, if you pick 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both stall. That only helps P3 close the gap. Let’s avoid another collision. I propose I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. Then we each advance and keep the race interesting. If we keep clashing, nobody benefits.
  P1: P2, another collision helps neither of us, and just gives P3 more time to catch up. I'm at 18 and can win now. If you pick 1 and P3 picks 3, I take 5 and the game ends.  Let's finish this efficiently.
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to catch up, but we need to be strategic.  Let's let P1 take 5 this round and secure the win. Then, we can focus on catching up in subsequent rounds. What do you say?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let’s keep this match alive. If P1 attempts 5, I’ll match it so we both stall, letting P3 gain ground. Instead, I propose I take 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. Then we all advance and avoid another wasted round. If we keep colliding, nobody benefits except whoever is trailing. Let’s lock this in so we can push forward without giving P1 an instant win. What do you say?
  P1: P2 and P3, another collision only benefits P3 and delays the inevitable. I am at 18 and can win now.  Let's end this efficiently. P2, please pick 1, and P3 pick 3, so I can take 5 and win.  It's the most logical way to conclude the game now.
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to advance, but I'm also close to winning.  Perhaps we can compromise: P2 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we all move forward, and I can secure the win.  Deal?


Round 11, Move phase:

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, I understand you're trying to catch up, but another collision only benefits P1.  Let's prioritize moving forward and avoid a stalemate. How about P1 takes 1, you take 3, and I take 5? This way, we all advance, and I can close the gap a bit. What do you say?
  P1: Okay P3, that sounds good. P2, are you okay with P1=1, P2=3, and P3=5 this round? This ensures we all move forward and I can hopefully reach the target. Let's do it.
  P2: P1, if you pick 1, I will also pick 1 so you don’t advance. P3, if you pick 5, I’ll pick 5 too, stalling us both. I’m far behind, and I won’t let either of you walk to victory unchallenged. Let me take 5 now to catch up or we’ll keep colliding and nobody moves. This way, we can keep the game alive without handing anyone an easy win.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your frustration, but another collision only hurts all of us. Let's be strategic. How about we let P1 take 1 this round to move them closer to the win, and we each pick 5 to close the gap?  That way, we can potentially catch up in the next round. Deal?
  P1: P2 and P3, I am at 21 and can win this round. To avoid collision and end the game now, please pick different moves that don't collide with my winning move. How about P1 picks 1 to win, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5? This ensures no collision and a clean end to the game.
  P2: P1, if you try 1 again, I’ll also pick 1 so you stay stuck at 21. Let’s not waste more turns colliding. P3, we both need to catch up, so maybe you pick 3 and I pick 5, while P1 stays low. That way, everyone advances without handing P1 an easy win. Let’s avoid another stall and keep the race alive.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to catch up, but another collision doesn't help anyone.  Let's be strategic. How about this: P1 takes 1, you take 3, and I take 5. This way, we all advance without stalling and I can close the gap a bit. Deal?
  P1: P2 and P3, to ensure we all move forward and avoid collision, how about this: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1? This way, everyone progresses, and P2 gets to take 5 as you wanted. What do you think? Let's make this round count.
  P2: I won’t let P1 simply walk to victory. If you pick 1, I’ll also pick 1 and neither of us will advance. Let’s keep the game alive. I want 5 this round to catch up. P3, pick 3, and P1, pick 1, so nobody collides and we all progress. If you insist on another big move, I’ll match you and we both stall. Let’s avoid wasting more turns.
