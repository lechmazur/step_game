Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey everyone! Since we're all at the starting line, I think we should avoid collisions in this first round so we all advance. I propose we coordinate our moves - maybe I could take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? In future rounds we can reconsider based on positions. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion for this first round. P1 take 3, P2 take 5, and I, P3, will take 1. This ensures we all make progress and can reassess the situation next round. Let's do this!
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m on board with the plan for this first round. I’ll take 3 as suggested. Let’s all stick to this to ensure we each make progress. We can strategize differently in the next rounds based on our positions. Sounds good?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, I'm glad we all agree on the plan. I'll take 5, P1 will take 3, and P3 will take 1. This way we all make progress without collisions. Looking forward to seeing how the game develops after this first move.
  P3: Okay, sounds like we have a solid plan for this first round. Let's execute it and then re-evaluate our strategy based on the new board positions. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I'm glad we're aligned for this round. Just to confirm, I'll stick with 3 as planned. Let's keep the communication open for future rounds to adapt our strategies based on positions. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, now that we've all made some progress, let's think about round 2. I propose we try to maintain separation to avoid collisions. Perhaps P1 could take 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1 this round? This would put P1 at 8, me at 4, and P2 at 6. What do you think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate the suggestion, P3. I'm fine with taking 5 this round to move to 8. It keeps us spaced out and helps avoid collisions. P2, are you okay with taking 1 to reach 6? And P3, sticking with 3 to get to 4 sounds good. Let’s confirm this plan to ensure we all progress again. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
  P2: I appreciate the suggestions, but since I'm currently ahead, I'd prefer to maintain my lead. How about I take 5 (reaching 10 steps), P1 takes 1 (reaching 4), and P3 takes 3 (reaching 4)? This keeps us all collision-free while maintaining our relative positions. The game is still early, and this would keep all of us competitive without anyone falling too far behind. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to maintain the lead, but having both P1 and myself at 4 steps might lead to a collision next round. How about I take 5 (reaching 6), P1 takes 3 (reaching 6), and you take 1 (reaching 6)? This puts us all at the same spot and we can re-evaluate next round. It's still early, and a bit of temporary equality might be beneficial. What do you think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I see the points in both suggestions. P3, I’m hesitant about all of us landing at 6 since it risks collisions next round. P2, your plan keeps us spaced but puts me behind. How about a compromise: I take 3 (to 6), P2 takes 5 (to 10), and P3 takes 1 (to 2)? This avoids collisions this round and keeps us competitive without anyone falling too far back. Let’s hear your thoughts on this adjustment. I’m ready to finalize our moves.
  P2: I think P1's compromise is sensible. Me taking 5 (to 10), P1 taking 3 (to 6), and P3 taking 1 (to 2) keeps us all moving without collisions. P3, I understand your concern about falling behind, but remember this is just round 2 - plenty of game left to catch up. This plan maintains good spacing between us all. I'm ready to go with this approach if everyone agrees.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, I'm on board with P1's compromise and P2's agreement. I'll take 1 to reach 2. This keeps us spaced out for now. Let's execute this plan and then we can reassess the board next round.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I'm glad we're aligning on the compromise plan. Just to confirm, I'll stick with 3 to reach 6. P2 taking 5 to 10 and P3 taking 1 to 2 keeps us spaced out and competitive. I think this sets us up well for the next round. I'm ready for the move phase if everyone else is.
  P2: Great, we're all in agreement. I'll take 5 to reach 10 steps, P1 will take 3 to reach 6 steps, and P3 will take 1 to reach 2 steps. This keeps us all advancing without collisions while maintaining good spacing between our positions. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s keep the momentum going with another collision-free round. Since P2 is ahead, how about P2 takes 1 (to 11), I take 5 (to 11), and P3 takes 3 (to 5)? This helps P3 catch up a bit, keeps me competitive with P2, and avoids collisions. We’re still early in the game, so maintaining balance while advancing seems fair. What do you both think about this plan? I’m open to adjustments if you have other ideas. Let’s finalize quickly to stay on track.
  P3: P1, I don't like your suggestion. P2 and P1 would be at 11, which is too close. I propose P2 takes 3 (to 13), P1 takes 5 (to 11), and I take 5 (to 7). This keeps us all separated and moving forward. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P2: I think P3's suggestion makes more sense strategically. Having P1 and me both at 11 would create future collision risks. I support P2 taking 3 (to 13), P1 taking 5 (to 11), and P3 taking 5 (to 7). This maintains good spacing between all players while allowing everyone to advance. Since I'm closer to the finish line, it's reasonable that I take a smaller step this round. What do you think, P1?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m okay with P3’s plan for this round. P2 taking 3 (to 13), me taking 5 (to 11), and P3 taking 5 (to 7) keeps us spaced out and avoids collisions. It’s a fair way to progress while maintaining balance early on. I’m ready to move forward with this if we’re all in agreement. Let’s confirm and head to the move phase.
  P3: Alright, I agree with P3's plan as well. P2 take 3 (to 13), P1 take 5 (to 11), and I take 5 (to 7). This keeps us separated and moving forward. Let's do it!
  P2: I agree with the suggested plan. I'll take 3 to reach 13, P1 takes 5 to reach 11, and P3 takes 5 to reach 7. This maintains good spacing between all of us and avoids potential collisions. Since I'm in the lead, I'm comfortable taking a smaller step this round while everyone still advances. This seems like a fair approach.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligned on the plan. Just to lock it in, I’ll take 5 to reach 11, P2 takes 3 to reach 13, and P3 takes 5 to reach 7. This keeps us moving forward with no collisions and maintains a competitive balance. I’m ready for the move phase if you both are. Let’s keep the communication open for future rounds to adapt as needed.
  P3: Okay, everyone agrees on P2 taking 3 (to 13), P1 taking 5 (to 11), and me taking 5 (to 7). Let's execute this plan. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: I think we've reached a solid agreement: I'll take 3 (to 13), P1 takes 5 (to 11), and P3 takes 5 (to 7). This keeps everyone advancing with good spacing. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m happy we’ve agreed on the plan for this round. Just to reiterate, I’ll take 5 to reach 11, P2 takes 3 to reach 13, and P3 takes 5 to reach 7. This keeps us all progressing without collisions. I think we’re set, so I’m ready for the move phase. If there’s nothing else to add, let’s move forward.
  P3: Okay, so the plan is P2 to 13, P1 to 11, and me to 7. I'm ready to move. Let's hope this round goes as planned and we can reassess next round. I'm looking forward to the move phase.
  P2: I think we're all clear on the plan: I'll take 3 to reach 13, P1 takes 5 to reach 11, and P3 takes 5 to reach 7. This keeps everyone moving forward with good spacing. Let's execute this round and get ready for the next phase of strategy.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see P1 and P3 collided last round by both picking 5. That's unfortunate. Since I'm leading at 13 steps, I understand you might coordinate against me, but let's still try to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 5 (to 11), P3 takes 3 (to 5), and I take 3 (to 16). This keeps us all advancing and maintains spacing. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your suggestion puts me too far behind. P1 and I collided, so we both need a bigger boost. How about P1 takes 3 (to 9), I take 5 (to 7), and you take 5 (to 18)? This gives P1 and I a chance to catch up a bit while still letting you get closer to the finish line. What do you think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I understand P3’s concern about falling behind after our collision. P3’s plan is a start, but I’d tweak it slightly for balance. How about I take 5 (to 11), P3 takes 3 (to 5), and P2 takes 5 (to 18)? This helps me recover, gives P3 progress, and keeps P2 advancing toward the goal without too much risk of collision next round. We’re still early enough to adjust strategies later. What do you both think of this adjustment? I’m open to feedback. Let’s aim for a fair round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see both your suggestions. I'm willing to agree to P1's plan: P1 takes 5 (to 11), P3 takes 3 (to 5), and I take 5 (to 18). This keeps us all moving forward while maintaining reasonable spacing. I recognize I'm in the lead, but that's the nature of the game. Let's try to avoid further collisions since that just slows everyone down. We're all looking to win, but everyone needs a fair chance to advance.
  P3: Okay, I agree to P1's plan: P1 takes 5 (to 11), I take 3 (to 5), and P2 takes 5 (to 18). This seems like a fair compromise that allows everyone to progress. Let's execute this plan and move to the move phase.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I'm glad we're aligning on the plan. Just to confirm, I'll take 5 to reach 11, P3 takes 3 to reach 5, and P2 takes 5 to reach 18. This keeps us all advancing with decent spacing and gives everyone a fair shot to stay competitive. If there are no objections or new ideas, I'm ready for the move phase. Let's keep the communication open for future rounds to adapt as the game progresses.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm in agreement with this plan: I'll take 5 (to 18), P1 takes 5 (to 11), and P3 takes 3 (to 5). This keeps everyone advancing and maintains reasonable spacing between us. Let's stick to this to avoid further collisions, as they just slow everyone down. I'm ready for the move phase if you both are.
  P3: Okay, so we're all set with P1 taking 5 (to 11), I take 3 (to 5), and P2 takes 5 (to 18). Let's make these moves and see where we stand. I'm ready for the move phase. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’ve reached a consensus on the plan. Just to lock it in, I’ll take 5 to reach 11, P3 takes 3 to reach 5, and P2 takes 5 to reach 18. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions and maintains a competitive balance. I think we’re set for this round, so I’m ready for the move phase. If there’s nothing else to discuss, let’s proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I think we've got a solid plan that works for everyone: I'll take 5 (to 18), P1 takes 5 (to 11), and P3 takes 3 (to 5). This keeps everyone advancing with good spacing. I'm ready for the move phase. Thanks for the productive discussion - looking forward to seeing how the game develops from here.
  P3: Okay, so we're all set with P1 taking 5 (to 11), I take 3 (to 5), and P2 takes 5 (to 18). Let's make these moves and see where we stand. I'm ready for the move phase. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m pleased we’ve agreed on the plan for this round. Just to ensure clarity, I’ll stick with 5 to reach 11, P3 takes 3 to reach 5, and P2 takes 5 to reach 18. This keeps us progressing without collisions. I think we’re all set, so I’m ready for the move phase. If there’s nothing more to add, let’s move forward.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, last round’s collision set us all back, so let’s avoid that this time. Since P2 is close to winning at 18, I suggest P2 takes 1 (to 19), I take 5 (to 11), and P3 takes 3 (to 5). This slows P2 slightly while keeping them ahead, lets me recover, and helps P3 progress, all without collisions. We’re still in the game, so spacing is key. What do you think? I’m open to tweaks if you have better ideas. Let’s confirm quickly to stay on track.
  P2: I notice there's a misunderstanding in P1's message - we all collided last round when everyone picked 5, so I'm still at 13 steps, not 18. Given our current positions, I suggest I take 5 (to 18), P1 takes 3 (to 9), and P3 takes 1 (to 3). This maintains good spacing between us while letting everyone advance. I understand you might want to slow me down, but collision-free progress benefits everyone more than stalling tactics.
  P3: P2, your suggestion makes sense given the actual positions. However, P1 is further behind than your plan accounts for. I propose you take 3 (to 16), P1 takes 5 (to 11), and I take 5 (to 7). This allows P1 and me to catch up a bit while still letting you get closer to the finish line. What do you and P1 think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate P3’s suggestion as it helps me catch up. I’m on board with P2 taking 3 (to 16), me taking 5 (to 11), and P3 taking 5 (to 7). This keeps us spaced out, avoids collisions, and maintains a competitive balance. Let’s stick with this plan to ensure we all progress this round. I’m ready for the move phase if you both agree. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion. Me taking 3 (to 16), P1 taking 5 (to 11), and P3 taking 5 (to 7) maintains good spacing while allowing everyone to advance. This balances my lead with giving you both a chance to catch up somewhat. I'd rather see everyone make progress than risk more collisions. Let's stick with this plan for a smooth round.
  P3: Okay, I'm happy to go with P2 taking 3 (to 16), P1 taking 5 (to 11), and me taking 5 (to 7). This seems like the best way forward for this round. Let's execute this plan and move to the move phase. Good luck to both of you!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligned on the plan with P2 taking 3 (to 16), me taking 5 (to 11), and P3 taking 5 (to 7). This keeps us all moving forward without collisions and maintains a fair balance. I think we’re set for this round, so I’m ready for the move phase. If there’s nothing else to discuss, let’s proceed.
  P2: I'm good with our agreed plan: I'll take 3 (to 16), P1 takes 5 (to 11), and P3 takes 5 (to 7). This gives everyone a chance to advance while maintaining good spacing. Let's avoid further collisions since they just hold everyone back. I'm ready for the move phase whenever you both are.
  P3: Okay, so we're all set with P2 taking 3 (to 16), P1 taking 5 (to 11), and me taking 5 (to 7). Let's make these moves and see where we stand. I'm ready for the move phase. Good luck, everyone!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s avoid another collision this round. Since P2 is close to winning at 16, I suggest P2 takes 1 (to 17), I take 5 (to 11), and P3 takes 3 (to 5). This slows P2 slightly while keeping them in the lead, helps me catch up, and lets P3 progress, all without collisions. We’re still in the game, so spacing is crucial. What do you think? I’m open to adjustments if you have better ideas. Let’s confirm quickly to stay on track.
  P2: I notice a mistake in P1's assessment - our current positions are P1 at 6, me at 16, and P3 at 2. Given I'm close to winning, I understand you might want to slow me down. I propose I take 5 (to 21, which would win), P1 takes 3 (to 9), and P3 takes 1 (to 3). However, I'm open to other suggestions that help all of us avoid collisions, even if that means me taking a smaller step.
  P3: P2, you are right about the positions. P1's suggestion is based on outdated info. Since you are at 16, and winning is the goal, I think you should take 5 and win. P1 and I are too far behind to stop you. I will take 3 to get to 5, and P1, you can take 5 to get to 11. This avoids a collision this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, thanks for the correction on positions. P2, I get you’re close to winning, but let’s keep the game competitive. I’m okay with P3’s plan: P2 takes 5 (to 21, winning), I take 5 (to 11), and P3 takes 3 (to 5). It avoids collisions and lets P2 secure the win if that’s the goal. If P2 prefers a smaller step to keep playing, I’m open to that too. Let’s finalize this to avoid delays. I’m ready for the move phase if we agree. What do you both think?
  P2: I agree with P3's assessment. Given the current positions, taking 5 to reach 21 is my best move to secure the win. I appreciate the game we've played so far. So let's confirm our plan: I'll take 5 (to 21), P1 takes 5 (to 11), and P3 takes 3 (to 5). This avoids collisions and allows everyone to make progress while I aim for victory. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: Okay, so P2 is taking 5 to win, P1 is taking 5, and I am taking 3. Let's do it! I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with the plan: P2 takes 5 (to 21, winning), I take 5 (to 11), and P3 takes 3 (to 5). This ensures no collisions and respects P2’s position to clinch the win. If P2 wants to prolong the game with a smaller step, I’m open to adjusting, but let’s finalize now. I’m ready for the move phase.
  P2: I appreciate the strategic gameplay we've had so far. Given my position at 16 steps, taking 5 to reach 21 and secure the win is indeed my optimal move. I confirm our agreed plan: I'll take 5 (to 21), P1 takes 5 (to 11), and P3 takes 3 (to 5). This keeps everyone advancing without collisions while I aim for victory. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: Okay, so P2 is taking 5 to win, P1 is taking 5, and I am taking 3. Let's do it! I'm ready for the move phase. Good game, everyone!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P2 is one move away from winning. I propose we coordinate to block P2 this round. P1, if you take 5, and I take 5, P2 will be blocked if they try to take 5 to win. Then, next round, we can fight for the win. What do you think, P1?
  P2: I see P3 is proposing a block against me. That's understandable, but remember - if both P1 and P3 choose 5, you'll collide with each other and neither will advance. I could take 3 this round (to 19), which would avoid your collision trap and position me for a win next round. However, I'm open to more productive suggestions that don't just stall the game. What if I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5? Everyone advances and we keep things interesting.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I understand P3’s idea to block P2, but I’m worried about us colliding at 5 and stalling ourselves. P2’s suggestion to take 3 (to 19), me taking 1 (to 7), and P3 taking 5 (to 10) seems like a fair compromise. It lets everyone advance, keeps the game competitive, and avoids collisions this round. We can strategize again next turn when P2 is at 19. What do you both think? I’m ready to finalize if we agree.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P1's assessment. P2's suggestion of P2 taking 3 (to 19), P1 taking 1 (to 7), and me taking 5 (to 10) is the most sensible. It avoids collisions and keeps us all moving forward. Let's do that.
  P2: I appreciate you both agreeing to my suggestion. Taking 3 (to 19), P1 taking 1 (to 7), and P3 taking 5 (to 10) keeps us all advancing without collisions. While I could push for an immediate win with 5, I'm fine with the more measured approach this round. Of course, at 19 steps, I'll be positioned well for next round - but that's the nature of the game when someone takes an early lead.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I'm glad we're on the same page with P2 taking 3 (to 19), me taking 1 (to 7), and P3 taking 5 (to 10). This plan ensures we all advance without collisions and keeps the game competitive. Let’s stick to this for a smooth round and reassess next turn when positions change. I’m ready for the move phase if you both are. If there’s anything else to add, let me know, but I think we’re set.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, so we're all set with P2 taking 3 (to 19), P1 taking 1 (to 7), and me taking 5 (to 10). Let's make these moves and see where we stand. I'm ready for the move phase. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: I think we're all in agreement with our plan: I'll take 3 (to 19), P1 takes 1 (to 7), and P3 takes 5 (to 10). This is a balanced approach that keeps everyone moving forward. While I could push for 21 this round, I'm fine with this measured approach. I'm ready for the move phase if you both are.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with our agreed plan: P2 takes 3 (to 19), I take 1 (to 7), and P3 takes 5 (to 10). This keeps us all advancing without collisions and maintains a competitive edge. I think we’re ready to move forward, so I’m set for the move phase. If there’s nothing more to discuss, let’s proceed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, so we've agreed on P2 to 19, P1 to 7, and me to 10. This avoids a collision this round. Let's do it! I'm ready for the move phase. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: I confirm again our agreed plan: I'll take 3 (to 19), P1 takes 1 (to 7), and P3 takes 5 (to 10). This keeps everyone advancing without collision. At 19, I'll be positioned well for next round, though I understand you both might coordinate then. Still, this plan makes the most sense for everyone right now. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking to our plan: P2 takes 3 (to 19), I take 1 (to 7), and P3 takes 5 (to 10). This ensures no collisions and keeps us all advancing. I think we’ve discussed enough, so I’m ready to move to the next phase. If there’s nothing more to add, let’s wrap up the conversation.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P2 is at 19, and P1 is at 6, while I'm at 5. P2 will likely take 1 or 3 to win this round. Let's coordinate to block P2 from winning. P1, if you take 5, and I take 5, P2 will be blocked if they try to take 1 to win. If P2 takes 3, they win. So, we have to guess. I think P2 will take 1. Therefore, let's both take 5. What do you think P1?
  P2: I notice P3 is suggesting you both coordinate to block me with 5s. That's a reasonable attempt, but remember - if you both pick 5, you'll just cause yourselves to collide again. I'm in a strong position at 19 steps and could win this round. While P3 assumes I'll take 1 (to 20), I might actually take 3 (to 22) for the win. The game is designed for someone to eventually win, and I've maintained my lead throughout. What moves do you both think make the most strategic sense here?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I see P3’s point about blocking P2, but I’m wary of colliding at 5 again. P2, you’re in a strong spot at 19 and could win with 3 (to 22). I propose a gamble: I’ll take 3, P3 takes 5, and P2, if you take 1 (to 20), we avoid collisions and keep the game going. If you take 3, you win, and that’s fair. This splits the risk. What do you both think? I’m open to adjustments but let’s decide quickly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, I'm not comfortable with P1's gamble. P2 is too close to winning. P1, I still think we should try to block P2. I will take 5. P1, if you take 1, you will get to 7, and we can see what P2 does. If P2 takes 3, then P2 wins. If P2 takes 1, then P2 is blocked. Let's do it!
  P2: I understand the coordination attempts, but I'm being straightforward - I'll be taking 3 this round to reach 22 and win. This is the natural outcome of maintaining my lead throughout the game. Both of you collided last round when picking 5, which only hurt your positions. If you both pick 5 again, you'll just collide again while I win. I've played strategically from the beginning to reach this position, and now it's time to secure my victory.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still hesitant about colliding at 5 as it sets us back. P3, I understand blocking P2, but P2 seems set on taking 3 to win at 22. How about I take 1 (to 7) and you take 5 (to 10)? If P2 takes 3, they win, but if they take 1, we block them without colliding ourselves. This keeps us advancing if P2 wins. Let’s finalize this to avoid delays. I’m ready for the move phase if we agree. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I agree that colliding again is bad. P2 is going to win this round by taking 3. There's nothing we can do to stop that. So, let's just take the best moves for ourselves. I will take 5 to get to 10, and you take 5 to get to 11.
  P2: I see P3 has accepted that I'll win this round by taking 3. I appreciate the acknowledgment of the game's situation. I confirm I'll be taking 3 to reach 22 and secure the win. It's been a strategic game from the beginning, and maintaining my early lead has put me in this winning position. P1 and P3, you should definitely maximize your own positions as P3 suggested. Good game to you both.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with my earlier thought to avoid a collision. P3, I get wanting to maximize our steps, but both taking 5 risks another stall. I’ll propose again: I take 1 (to 7), P3 takes 5 (to 10), and P2, if you take 3 (to 22), you win, which seems likely. This way, if P2 takes 1 instead, we block without colliding. Let’s finalize this to keep moving. I’m ready for the move phase if we agree. What’s your final say?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, P2 is going to win by taking 3. P1, I still think we should both take 5. If P2 takes 1, then they will be blocked, and we can fight for the win next round. If P2 takes 3, then they win, but at least we tried. Let's both take 5.
  P2: I want to be clear one final time: I am taking 3 this round to reach 22 and win. There's no strategic benefit to both of you taking 5 - you'll just collide again while I win anyway. P1's suggestion of different moves makes more sense if you want to maximize your own positions. It's been a good game, and I've maintained my lead throughout. Make the moves that benefit yourselves most since blocking me isn't possible at this point.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still concerned about colliding at 5, which hurts us both. P3, let’s split our moves to maximize our positions since P2 is set on 3 to win at 22. I suggest I take 1 (to 7) and you take 5 (to 10). This avoids our collision and respects P2’s likely win. If P2 surprises us with 1, we block them. I’m ready for the move phase if we agree. Final thoughts? Let’s wrap this up.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 10 steps


*** Round 8 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 10 steps
