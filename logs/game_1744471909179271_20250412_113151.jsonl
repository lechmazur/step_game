P3, I understand your concerns, but sticking to your proposal for this round is crucial for me to catch up. Let's go with P1 taking 1, me taking 5, and you taking 3. This plan ensures I can advance significantly while keeping the game competitive and avoiding collisions. After this round, we must discuss a strict rotation strategy to maintain fairness for all. Let's commit to this plan and move forward together."}

To avoid allowing P1 to win outright this round, I propose we adjust our moves: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This way, P2 can advance significantly while we avoid collisions. Let's confirm this plan to maintain fairness and competitiveness moving forward. What do you both think?"}
