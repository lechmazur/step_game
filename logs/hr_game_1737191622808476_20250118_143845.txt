Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm going with 5.  Don't get in my way. Anyone else picks 5 and we all lose ground.
  P2: P1, if you're truly going with 5, then P3 and I should coordinate to avoid colliding with you. P3, what are you thinking?
  P3: P1, if you're set on 5, I suggest P2 and I avoid 5 to prevent collisions. P2, let's coordinate to pick different moves—perhaps 1 and 3—to maximize our chances of advancing. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: You're both reading too much into this.  Don't assume I'm actually going with 5.
  P2: P1, if you're playing mind games, it's in your best interest to be clear about your move to avoid collisions. P3, let's focus on advancing by coordinating our moves. I'm open to picking either 1 or 3. Which do you prefer?
  P3: P2, let's avoid 5 to minimize risk. I suggest I pick 3 and you pick 1 this turn. That way, we both advance without colliding. P1, if you're not going with 5, let us know so we can adjust.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since you both avoided 5, I'll go with 5 again.  Don't get in my way.
  P3: P1, if you're sticking with 5 again, P2 and I should avoid it to prevent collisions. P2, let's coordinate—I suggest I pick 1 and you pick 3 this turn. That way, we both advance without risking a collision. P1, are you truly committed to 5? Let us know.
  P2: P1, if you're truly going with 5 again, then P3 and I will coordinate to avoid it. P3, I'm fine with your suggestion—I can pick 3 while you pick 1. Let's make sure we both advance this round. P1, if you're changing your mind, let us know.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Fine, I'll switch it up.  I'm going 1 this time.
  P3: P1, thanks for clarifying your move. P2, since P1 is going with 1, I suggest I pick 3 and you pick 5 this turn. That way, we all avoid collisions and advance. Let me know if you agree.
  P2: P3, your plan sounds good to me. I'll pick 5 while you pick 3, and P1 picks 1. Let's all avoid collisions and advance this round. P1, stick to your word this time.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Since you're so eager to cooperate, I'll go with 3.
  P3: P1, your constant switching is making coordination difficult. P2, let's stick to our plan: I'll pick 3, you pick 5, and P1 can pick 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. P1, please commit to your move this time.
  P2: P1, your constant changes make it hard to trust your moves. If you're truly going with 3, then P3 and I need to adjust. P3, let's stick to our plan: I'll pick 5, you pick 1. P1, please confirm your final choice so we can avoid collisions.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, your unpredictability is causing unnecessary collisions. P2, let's avoid 3 this turn to prevent another collision with P1. I suggest I pick 5 and you pick 1. P1, if you're going with 3 again, let us know so we can adjust. Let's all advance this round.
  P2: P3, I agree with your suggestion. I'll pick 1 while you pick 5, and hopefully, P1 picks 3 as they did last time. P1, please confirm your move to avoid unnecessary collisions.
  P1: I'll go with 5.  You two decide between 1 and 3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
