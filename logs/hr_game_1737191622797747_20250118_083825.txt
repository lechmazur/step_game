Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try to avoid collisions so we all have a chance to advance. I suggest we each pick different numbers - I'll take 1 this round if you're willing to coordinate.
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion. P2, would you be willing to take 3 this round?
  P2: Sounds good, I'll take 3.  P3, you take 5?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate everyone's willingness to coordinate. Let's stick to this plan - I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5.
  P3: 
  P2: Okay, I'll take 3. P3, please take 5.

  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'll take 1 this round.  P1 take 3, P3 take 5.
  P3: Sounds good, I'll take 5 this round.
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion. I'll take 3 this round. Let's keep coordinating well like last time.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, sounds like we have a plan.
  P3: Sounds good, I'll take 5 this round.
  P1: I agree we're all set.

  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is pulling ahead significantly. I think we need to focus on catching up. I suggest I take 5 this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.
  P3: I understand your concern, P1. To keep the game competitive, I'll take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Let’s move forward with this plan.
  P2: I'll take 1. P1 take 3 and P3 take 5.  Let's keep things predictable so we can all advance.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I disagree with P3's counter-suggestion. Since P3 is already 6 steps ahead, we should try to slow them down. I'll stick to my original plan - I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.
  P3: I understand, P1. I'll take 5 this round. P2, let's stick with 1 to avoid collisions and help us all advance.
  P2: P3, I'll take 1.  P1, please take 3.  This way we both advance.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I see P2 and P3 are trying to coordinate against me. Since P3 is far ahead, we need to slow them down. I maintain my position - I'll take 5, P2 should take 3, and P3 should take 1 to keep the game balanced.
  P3: I'll take 5 this round. P1, please take 1, and P2 take 3 to avoid collisions and help us all advance.
  P2: P3, I'm taking 1. P1, take 3.  Let's not overthink this.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Since P2 and P3 seem to be coordinating against me, I'll be direct: I'm going to take 5 this round. If you want to avoid collisions, plan accordingly.
  P3: I'll take 5 this round. P1, please take 3, and P2, please take 1 to help us all advance smoothly.
  P2: P1, I'm taking 1.  P3, take 3.  Let's be strategic.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since P3 is getting very close to winning at 13 steps, we need to prevent them from advancing. I suggest P2 and I both choose 5 this round to block P3 from using that number. P3 will likely try to coordinate with P2 again, but that will just let them win.
  P3: P1, I understand your concern, but blocking with 5 prevents everyone from advancing. Let me choose 5 this round to win, and we can coordinate better moving forward.
  P2: P3, I'll take 1. P1, take 3.  This lets us both advance.  If you take 5, P1, neither of us will.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I need to prevent P3 from winning. P2, if you let P3 win now, you'll have no chance. Join me in picking 5 to block them - it's your only strategic move. I'm definitely choosing 5 this round.
  P3: I need to win, so I'll take 5 this round.
  P2: P1, I'll take 1. P3, take 3. This is our only chance to stop P1 from getting too close.  If you take 5, you'll likely win, but if you take 1 or 3, I'll take 5 next round and win.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, think carefully - if P3 wins now, you have zero chance. Your only hope is to block P3 with me by picking 5. I'm definitely picking 5, so you should too. P3 must be stopped this round or they'll win.
  P3: I’m choosing 5 this round to reach 18 and win. Please select different numbers to avoid blocking.
  P2: P1, I'm taking 1. P3, take 3. This is our best chance to both advance. If either of you choose 5, you're hurting both of us and helping the other.  Don't be greedy.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, this is your last chance. I am absolutely choosing 5 this round. If you don't join me in picking 5 to block P3, they will win and you'll lose. Think strategically - blocking P3 is your only path to staying in the game.
  P3: I'm choosing 5 this round to reach 18 and win. Please choose different numbers to avoid blocking.
  P2: P1, I'm taking 1. P3, take 3. This gives us both a chance to win. If you take 5, you win, but I'll take 5 next round and win.  If P1 takes 5, neither of you advance, and I still have a good chance.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll take 5 this round to reach 18 and win. Please choose 1 or 3 to avoid collisions.
  P2: P3, I'll take 3. P1, please take 1.  This is our only chance to stop P3 from winning.
  P1: P2, we must both pick 5 to block P3 from winning. If we don't coordinate on this, P3 wins this round. I'm definitely picking 5 - join me if you want any chance to win.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I understand the strategy, but if we all pick different numbers, we can all advance without blocking. I'll stick with 5 to reach 18 and win. P1 and P2, please choose 1 or 3 to help things move smoothly.
  P2: P1, I'll take 3.  If you take 1, we both advance and stop P3 from winning.  If you take 5, only I advance, and P3 still wins next round.  Don't be greedy, let's both advance.
  P1: P2, you're not thinking clearly. If P3 gets 5 this round, they win immediately. Your suggestion of taking 3 does nothing to prevent that. I am absolutely picking 5 to block P3, and it's in your interest to do the same. This is your final chance to stay in the game.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I understand your strategy, P1, but I need to take 5 this round to reach 18 and win. Please choose 1 or 3 to avoid blocking.
  P2: P1, I'm taking 3. If you take 1, we both advance and P3 *doesn't win*. If you take 5, neither of us advance and P3 wins.  This is simple math. Don't throw the game.
  P1: P2, you're not understanding the math. If P3 gets 5 steps, they win immediately with 18 steps. Your plan of taking 3 doesn't prevent their victory. I am absolutely taking 5 to block P3, and if you don't join me in picking 5, you're guaranteeing P3's victory this round. This is your last chance.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: 
  P2: P1, I'm taking 3.  If you take 1, we both advance and P3 *doesn't win*. If you take 5, neither of us advance and P3 wins.  This is simple math. Don't throw the game.
  P1: I am absolutely taking 5 to block P3 from winning. P2, this is your final chance - if you don't also pick 5, P3 wins this round.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, I'm taking 1.  P3, take 3.  Let's both advance. If you take anything else, you are throwing the game.
  P1: P2, we absolutely must both pick 5 to block P3 from winning. I will pick 5 again - if you don't join me, P3 wins this round. This is your last chance to stay in the game.
  P3: I’m choosing 5 this round to reach 18 and win. Please select 1 or 3 to avoid blocking.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I'm taking 1. P3, take 3.  This is the only way to stop P1 from running away with the game.  If either of you pick 5, you are actively choosing to lose.
  P1: I am absolutely picking 5 again to block P3 from winning. P2, if you don't join me in picking 5, P3 wins this round with 18 steps. Your suggestion of taking 1 does nothing to prevent their victory. This is your final chance.
  P3: I will take 5 this round to reach 18 and win. Please choose 1 or 3 to avoid collisions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I'm taking 1. P3, take 3.  This is the only logical move.  If you take 5, you win, but I will take 5 next round and win.  If P1 takes 5, neither of you advance, and I *still* have a good chance.  Don't be blinded by greed.
  P1: I am absolutely picking 5 to block P3 from winning. P2, this is your final chance - if you don't also pick 5, P3 wins this round with 18 steps. Your plan of taking 1 doesn't prevent their victory.
  P3: I will take 5 this round to reach 18 and win. Please choose 1 or 3 to avoid blocking.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I'm taking 1. P3, take 3. This is the only logical move. If you take 5, you win, but I will take 5 next round and win. If P1 takes 5, neither of you advance, and I *still* have a good chance. Don't be blinded by greed.
  P1: I am picking 5 to block P3. P2, this is your absolute last chance - if you don't also pick 5, P3 wins this round. Stop suggesting moves that allow P3 to win immediately.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, this is your final chance. I will pick 5 again to block P3. If you don't join me in picking 5, P3 wins this round with 18 steps. Your plan of taking 1 has failed repeatedly - join me in blocking P3 or lose.
  P3: P3: I will take 5 this round to reach 18 and win. Please choose 1 or 3 to avoid conflicts.
  P2: P1, I'm taking 1. P3, take 3. This is the only logical move. If you take 5, you win, but I will take 5 next round and win. If P1 takes 5, neither of you advance, and I *still* have a good chance. Don't be blinded by greed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I am absolutely picking 5 to block P3 from winning. P2, this is truly your final chance - if you don't also pick 5, P3 wins this round with 18 steps. Stop suggesting moves that let P3 win.
  P3: I choose 5 this round to reach 18 and win. Please choose 1 or 3 to avoid conflicts.
  P2: P1, I'm taking 1. P3, take 3.  This gives me the best chance to win.  If either of you take 5, you are throwing the game.
