Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's avoid a collision on the first turn by coordinating different moves: one picks 1, one 3, one 5. This way, we all advance and build from there. I'm open to suggestions on roles—perhaps rotate high picks fairly? What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P3: I support a coordinated approach this turn. I’m leaning toward an aggressive move by taking the 5-step option if P1 picks 1 and P2 picks 3. However, if anyone deviates, I’ll adjust my move to maximize my chance at winning. What do you both think?
  P2: I'm P2. I agree with P1's suggestion to avoid collision on the first turn. To implement this, I'll choose a middle value. Let's say P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5 as suggested. This way, we all advance. For future turns, we can discuss a rotation or strategy. For now, let's focus on getting a safe start. If you're both agreeable, I'll stick with 3.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm on board with the initial plan: I'll pick 1 to avoid collision and ensure we all advance. For fairness in future turns, let's rotate the high move—P3 took 5 this turn, so P2 could take 5 next, and I'll get it after. This keeps things balanced. Agree, P2 and P3?
  P3: I still favor a coordinated start—if we all stick to it, it's safe. However, with winning at stake, I'm ready to adjust quickly if anyone deviates or tries to grab an edge. Remember, only one of us can win, so trust is as fragile as it is temporary.
  P2: Since we've agreed on a coordinated start with P1 picking 1, me (P2) picking 3, and P3 picking 5, let's confirm our moves for this turn. I'll stick with 3 as planned. For the next turn, I propose we continue the coordination but adjust our picks to avoid a pattern. Perhaps we can randomize or discuss a new strategy. I'm open to suggestions on how to proceed after this initial coordination. Let's see how it plays out and adapt accordingly.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: For Round 2, to keep coordination going and reduce the lead gap, I propose I pick 3, P2 picks 5 as per rotation, and P3 picks 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions and promotes fairness. I'm open to tweaks—thoughts, P2 and P3?
  P3: I appreciate the plan, but I’m a bit uneasy about giving up my current lead. While coordination minimizes collisions, I fear that sticking rigidly to it may slow my progress. I'm willing to follow a coordinated approach if we agree to remain flexible for opportunities. Let's keep our options open so that if a chance to secure the win arises, we can adjust accordingly.
  P2: To continue the coordination and address P3's concern about flexibility, I suggest we stick to the proposed plan for this round but remain open to adjusting our strategy for the next round based on the outcome. So, for Round 2, I'll follow the plan: P1 picks 3, I (P2) pick 5, and P3 picks 1. Let's see how it plays out and reassess our strategy afterward. If P1 and P3 agree, I'll proceed with picking 5 this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand your caution about your lead and the need for flexibility. To keep things smooth this round, let's stick with the plan: I pick 3, P2 picks 5, and you pick 1 to ensure we all advance. This builds trust for future adjustments. If you have tweaks, share them now. Otherwise, I'm ready to proceed. What do you think?
  P3: I’ll stick with the plan and pick 1 this round. However, with my current lead I want to emphasize that I’m ready to adjust my move in future turns if a winning opportunity arises. Let’s coordinate now but remain flexible for the next rounds.
  P2: To build on our current coordination, let's analyze the positions: P3 is leading with 5+1=6 steps, I (P2) am at 3+5=8 steps, and P1 is at 1+3=4 steps. It seems I've taken the lead. For Round 3, I propose P1 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and I pick 1 to avoid collision and maintain progress. This keeps the game fair and competitive. Let's discuss if anyone has a different strategy or adjustment to propose for Round 3.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's confirm for Round 2: I'll stick with picking 3 as planned, ensuring we all advance and build trust. Regarding Round 3, P2's proposal for me to pick 5 is fine, but to avoid future ties that could cause collisions, perhaps we rotate more dynamically. I'm open to tweaks—thoughts?
  P3: I'm still on board with coordination when it benefits us all, but I must stress that my lead makes me alert for any tactical shifts. In Round 3, I might lean into a stronger move if things seem ripe for a win. I propose we signal clearly before any deviation, so our shifts are transparent. Let’s agree to alert each other when about to pivot, keeping our strategy flexible without compromising trust.
  P2: To progress, I'll summarize our current state: P1 is at 4 steps, I (P2) am at 8 steps, and P3 is at 6 steps. For Round 3, my previous proposal was P1 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and I pick 1. However, considering P1's suggestion to rotate dynamically, I'm open to adjusting. Let's discuss a more dynamic rotation or strategy for Round 3 to avoid predictability and potential collisions in future rounds. I'm willing to listen to alternative proposals that keep the game competitive and fair.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the current state (P1: 4 steps, P2: 3 steps, P3: 5 steps), it seems Round 2's moves didn't follow our coordinated plan due to a collision between P2 and P3. For Round 3, to avoid another collision, I suggest P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. This ensures we all advance. Let's discuss if there's a better strategy or stick with this plan. I'm open to adjustments to maintain fairness and competitiveness.
  P1: I'm concerned about the Round 2 deviation by P2 and P3, which broke our coordination and cost progress. To avoid another collision, I'm open to your suggestion, P2: I pick 5, you pick 3, and P3 picks 1. This could help me catch up fairly. However, with trust fragile, I need assurances from both of you before committing. Let's discuss or confirm.
  P3: P3: I commit to choosing 1 this round. Trust is essential if we’re to progress, so I’m sticking with the plan for now. However, I’m ready to switch tactics if a clear winning opening appears—so let's all confirm our moves now and avoid any surprises.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To progress fairly in Round 3, I confirm my previous suggestion: P1 picks 5, I (P2) pick 3, and P3 picks 1. This ensures we all advance. Let's finalize our moves for this round. I'll stick with picking 3 if both of you confirm your moves. For future rounds, we should discuss a more dynamic strategy to avoid predictability and potential collisions. I'm open to alternative proposals that maintain competitiveness and fairness. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: I confirm I'll pick 5 this round as planned, ensuring we all advance and rebuild trust after last round's issue. P3's commitment to 1 and P2's to 3 sound good. For Round 4, let's discuss a more adaptive strategy to avoid predictability and maintain fairness. Thoughts?
  P3: I'll stick with picking 1 this round as agreed. However, if either of you plan to shift strategies in upcoming rounds, please be upfront so we can all adjust. While I value coordination now, I'm also ready to seize a winning moment when it comes.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To progress fairly in Round 3, let's finalize our moves as discussed: P1 picks 5, I (P2) pick 3, and P3 picks 1. For Round 4, I propose we adopt a more adaptive strategy. Since P1 is currently behind, perhaps we can rotate the highest move (5) among us or pick based on the current standings to maintain competitiveness. I'm open to suggestions. Let's confirm our Round 3 moves and discuss Round 4's strategy. If you're both on board with the Round 3 plan, I'll proceed with picking 3.
  P1: I'm committed to picking 5 for Round 3 as planned, ensuring we all advance and rebuild trust. After seeing the results, let's adapt our strategy for Round 4 based on new standings to minimize collisions and maintain fairness. I'm open to suggestions now.
  P3: I confirm I'll pick 1 this round as agreed. However, I want us to remember that while coordination is key, I’ll seize any clear chance to win if one appears. So, if either of you plan a significant shift, please give a heads-up in advance.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: With me leading at 9 steps and you both at 6, to minimize collisions and ensure steady progress, I propose for Round 4: I pick 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. This maintains fairness and allows all to advance. I'm open to tweaks or alternatives for better coordination. Thoughts?
  P2: To progress fairly in Round 4, I agree with P1's proposal: I'll pick 5, P3 picks 1, and P1 picks 3. This ensures we all advance. For Round 5, considering P1's lead, I suggest we reassess our strategy. Perhaps the player with the lower score can pick a higher number to catch up. I'm open to alternative proposals that maintain competitiveness. Let's finalize our Round 4 moves and discuss Round 5's strategy. If P3 is agreeable, I'll proceed with picking 5 this round.
  P3: I confirm I'll pick 1 for Round 4. While I appreciate our coordinated plan, I remain ready to adjust if a clear win opens up. For Round 5, I agree that we discuss giving lower scorers a chance to catch up. Let’s stick with this round’s proposal and be transparent about any shifts in strategy afterward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I confirm I'll pick 3 this round to keep our coordination intact and ensure we all advance. For Round 5, with my lead at 9 steps, I propose a balanced rotation where the trailing player picks 5 to catch up fairly—perhaps P2 or P3 takes it. This maintains trust and competitiveness. Thoughts or adjustments?
  P2: To progress fairly in Round 4, I agree with P1's proposal: I'll pick 5, P3 picks 1, and P1 picks 3. For Round 5, considering P1's lead, I suggest we reassess our strategy to give the lower scorer a chance to catch up. Perhaps P3, being at the same score as me, can pick 5 next round if we continue coordination. Let's finalize our Round 4 moves and discuss Round 5's strategy. I'm open to alternative proposals that maintain competitiveness.
  P3: I confirm my move for Round 4 remains 1. For Round 5, while I’m happy to maintain our coordination, I reserve flexibility to adjust if a winning chance emerges. Let's keep our dialogue open so that if a significant opportunity arises, we all can adapt quickly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirming I'll pick 3 for Round 4 to ensure we all advance and rebuild trust. For Round 5, with projected scores (P1:12, P2:11, P3:7), I propose P3 picks 5 to catch up, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3 to minimize collisions and maintain fairness. This keeps the game competitive. If anyone has tweaks or concerns, share now; otherwise, let's proceed smoothly.
  P2: To progress fairly in Round 4, I agree with P1's proposal: I'll pick 5, P3 picks 1, and P1 picks 3. For Round 5, considering P1's lead and our current standings (P1: 9, P2: 6, P3: 6), I suggest P3 picks 5 to catch up, I pick 1, and P1 picks 3. This maintains competitiveness and minimizes collisions. Let's finalize our Round 4 moves and discuss Round 5's strategy. If P3 is agreeable, I'll proceed with picking 5 this round.
  P3: I'll stick with our plan and pick 1 for Round 4. However, I want to stress that I'm ready to adjust aggressively if a clear winning opportunity appears in Round 5. Let's keep our signals transparent so that if any of us plan a major shift, we can all react accordingly.

  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm aware I'm behind with 7 steps and need to catch up. For Round 5, I'm ready to stick to a coordinated move if both of you commit, but if there's any major shift, I'll switch to an aggressive option. Clarity on your intended moves is crucial to avoid collisions while I try to claw back. Let's be transparent with our strategies to keep the game competitive and fair.
  P2: To progress fairly in Round 5, I suggest we follow the previously discussed plan: P3 picks 5 to catch up, I (P2) pick 1, and P1 picks 3. This maintains competitiveness and minimizes collisions. P3, with your current score, picking 5 is a reasonable chance to catch up. P1, sticking to 3 keeps your lead while avoiding a collision. Let's finalize our moves for Round 5. I'm willing to pick 1 if you both agree.
  P1: I'm in agreement with the Round 5 plan: I'll pick 3 to maintain steady progress, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5 to help catch up. This avoids collisions and keeps the game fair. P3, your commitment is noted—let's stick to this for now. For Round 6, with scores advancing, we should discuss adjustments to prevent predictability and ensure competitiveness. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’ll stick with picking 5 this round to catch up as planned. However, if either of you signals a significant shift next round, I may need to go aggressive to secure the win. Let’s confirm these moves and re-evaluate our strategy in Round 6.
  P2: To progress fairly in Round 5, I confirm I'll pick 1 as planned. P3, your decision to pick 5 will help you catch up. P1, sticking to 3 maintains your lead. For Round 6, considering the updated scores (P1: 15, P2: 12, P3: 12), I propose we reassess our strategy. Perhaps the player with the lower score can pick a higher number to stay competitive. Let's discuss adjustments to prevent predictability and ensure fairness. I'm open to alternative proposals that maintain competitiveness.
  P1: Confirming I'll pick 3 for Round 5 as agreed to ensure we all advance and maintain trust. For Round 6, with projected scores close, I suggest I pick 1 to give you both a chance to catch up—perhaps P2 picks 3 and P3 picks 5. This keeps the game balanced and competitive. I'm open to adjustments or alternatives. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I remain committed to our agreed plan this round and will stick with my move. However, given my deficit, I might need to lean aggressive in future rounds. Let's all be clear about our next moves to avoid collisions and ensure transparency. I'm focused on winning, so let's keep our strategies open and adapt as needed.
  P2: To progress fairly in Round 5, I'll stick with picking 1 as planned. For Round 6, considering the updated scores (P1: 12, P2: 11, P3: 12), I propose we adjust our strategy to maintain competitiveness. Since P1 is still ahead, perhaps P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5 to avoid collision and keep the game balanced. This way, we all advance and stay competitive. I'm open to alternative proposals that ensure fairness and minimize collisions. Let's discuss adjustments for Round 6.
  P1: I confirm I'll pick 3 for Round 5 to keep our coordination and avoid collisions. For Round 6, with projected scores (P1:15, P2:12, P3:12), P2's suggestion of me picking 1, you picking 3, and P3 picking 5 maintains fairness. However, given P3's hints at aggression, let's ensure transparency to prevent surprises. Thoughts or confirmations?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll commit to 5 in Round 6 for aggressive progress to catch up. I need clear signals from both of you—can you confirm your intended moves to avoid accidental collisions? Transparency now helps ensure numerical advancement without setbacks.
  P1: P3, I appreciate your transparency on picking 5. To avoid collision and stick to our discussed plan, I'll commit to picking 1 this round. P2, can you confirm you'll pick 3 as suggested? This ensures we all advance smoothly. Let's discuss Round 7 strategy after seeing the results.
  P2: To avoid collision in Round 6, I confirm I'll pick 3 as previously suggested. P1 has committed to 1 and P3 to 5. This ensures we all advance. For Round 7, with P1 at 16, P2 at 15, and P3 at 17, the game is competitive. I propose we reassess our strategy to maintain fairness. Perhaps the leader (P3) picks a lower number, and we rotate accordingly. Let's discuss adjustments for Round 7 after seeing the results of Round 6. I'm open to alternative proposals that maintain competitiveness and minimize collisions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I confirm my move is 5 this round. Looking ahead, if either of you plans to adjust your moves in Round 7, please signal clearly to avoid collisions. I’m set to aggressively catch up and will adapt if needed. Let's keep our transitions smooth and honest.
  P1: Confirmed, I'll pick 1 for Round 6 as agreed. For Round 7, with P3 likely leading at 17, I suggest we coordinate to prevent a quick win—perhaps P3 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5 to keep scores balanced and competitive. This maintains fairness; I'm open to adjustments or alternatives. Thoughts?
  P2: To progress fairly in Round 6, I confirm I'll pick 3 as previously suggested. P1 has committed to 1 and P3 to 5. For Round 7, considering P3 will likely be at 22 steps, I propose we adjust our strategy. If P3 picks 1, I pick 3, and P1 picks 5, we avoid a collision and maintain competitiveness. Let's discuss this after Round 6's results. I'm open to alternative proposals that ensure fairness and minimize collisions. Let's finalize our Round 6 moves and plan for Round 7.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm confirming my move as 5 for Round 6. To avoid surprises, if either of you plans a major shift for Round 7, please signal it now clearly. I'm committed to catching up but want us all to avoid accidental collisions. Let's keep our strategy transparent as we move ahead.
  P1: Confirming I'll pick 1 for Round 6 as agreed, ensuring no collisions. For Round 7, with P3 at 17 steps, a high pick risks an early win or collision. To keep the game competitive and fair, I propose P3 picks 1 to slow down, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. This balances scores and avoids risks—thoughts or adjustments?
  P2: To progress fairly in Round 6, I confirm I'll pick 3 as previously suggested. For Round 7, considering P3 will likely be at 22 steps if they win this round, I propose we adjust our strategy to prevent an early win. If P3 picks 1, I pick 3, and P1 picks 5, we avoid a collision and maintain competitiveness. Let's discuss this after Round 6's results. I'm open to alternative proposals that ensure fairness and minimize collisions.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the current standings (P1: 15, P2: 15, P3: 22) after Round 6's collision between P1 and P3, P3 has taken the lead. For Round 7, to avoid another collision and ensure fairness, I suggest P3 picks 1 to slow down, I pick 3, and P1 picks 5. This maintains competitiveness and balances scores. If P3 is willing to slow down, we can keep the game going. Otherwise, we risk another collision if multiple players pick high numbers. Let's discuss and finalize our moves for Round 7.
  P3: I must be aggressive to catch up; I’ll pick 5 this round. If you want to avoid collisions, please adjust your moves accordingly. I'm focused on winning, so transparency is key—let’s update our plans honestly if we shift from the previous coordination.
  P1: Given P3's commitment to picking 5, I'll avoid that to prevent another collision and ensure I advance. P2, let's coordinate distinct moves—perhaps you pick 1 and I pick 3? This keeps the game fair and competitive. For Round 8, we can reassess based on outcomes. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To avoid a collision in Round 7, I suggest I pick 1 and P1 picks 3, given P3's commitment to 5. This ensures we all advance. For Round 8, we should reassess our strategy based on the new standings. If P3 wins this round, they will be at 27 steps and win the game. Let's be cautious and adjust accordingly. I'm open to alternative proposals that maintain competitiveness and minimize collisions. Let's finalize our Round 7 moves.
  P3: I'm sticking with my aggressive approach—I’ll pick 5 this round to catch up. I know it risks a collision, but bold moves are needed. If you’re shifting or have a differing plan for future rounds, please signal clearly so we avoid missteps.
  P1: Confirming I'll pick 3 this round to avoid collision with P3's stated 5 and ensure we all advance. P2, please confirm your pick of 1 for smooth progress. For Round 8, with projected scores close, I propose we continue distinct moves—perhaps I pick 5, P2 picks 3, P3 picks 1—to maintain fairness and competitiveness. Thoughts or adjustments?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To avoid a collision in Round 7 and ensure we all advance, I confirm I'll pick 1 as previously suggested. P1 has agreed to pick 3, and P3 is picking 5. For Round 8, considering P3's potential win if they pick 5 again, I propose we reassess our strategy. If P3 wins this round, they will end the game. Let's be cautious and adjust accordingly. I'm open to alternative proposals that maintain competitiveness and minimize collisions. Let's finalize our Round 7 moves and plan for Round 8.
  P3: I reaffirm I’m picking 5 this round. I know it’s aggressive, but I need to close the gap. If you stick to your chosen moves, we can avoid collisions. I remain open to clear communication for future rounds—transparency helps us adapt if needed. Let’s keep our moves distinct and avoid unnecessary clashes.
  P1: Confirming I'll pick 3 for Round 7 to avoid collision and ensure we all advance. P3, your aggressive stance could lead to another tie if we both go high in future rounds—let's coordinate distinct moves for Round 8 to minimize risks and keep it competitive. P2, agree?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm leaning toward an aggressive approach this round to close the gap. However, if we all clearly commit to distinct moves that avoid collisions, I'm open to a coordinated plan. P1, with 18 steps you're near the finish line, so please signal your intended strategy, and P2, let’s pick a different number. Transparency now helps us all—let me know your moves to avoid a mix-up.
  P2: To progress fairly in Round 8, I suggest we coordinate distinct moves to avoid collisions. Given P1 is at 18 steps, P2 at 16, and P3 at 17, I propose: P1 picks 5, I (P2) pick 3, and P3 picks 1. This ensures we all advance and maintains competitiveness. If P3 is willing to slow down, it keeps the game going. Otherwise, P1 could win with a high pick. Let's discuss and finalize our moves for Round 8 to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. I'm open to adjustments.
  P1: P3, to maintain fairness and avoid another collision, I agree with P2's suggestion: I'll consider picking 5, you pick 1, and P2 picks 3. This ensures we all advance without risks. Your aggressive approach could backfire—let's coordinate distinctly for this round. Open to tweaks if it helps transparency. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the coordination proposal, but given our standings, I’m leaning toward an aggressive move this round. I won’t lock into the coordinated numbers if it enables an easy win for someone. Let’s be clear: I’m ready to adjust my move to prevent a safe win. Please confirm your final intentions so we can avoid accidental collisions, and we’ll see who seizes the opportunity.
  P2: To avoid collisions and maintain competitiveness in Round 8, I reiterate my previous suggestion: P1 picks 5, I (P2) pick 3, and P3 picks 1. This ensures we all advance. Given P1's proximity to the finish line, if P3 picks aggressively again, it risks a collision. Let's coordinate distinctly to maintain fairness. I'm open to adjustments if P3 signals a different plan. Let's finalize our moves for Round 8 to avoid missteps.
  P1: I agree with P2's proposal for Round 8: I'll pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. This avoids collisions and maintains fairness, giving everyone a chance to advance. P3, your aggressive stance risks backfiring—let's coordinate for mutual benefit and discuss Round 9 after. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I propose we change our Round 8 moves: let P1 pick 3, P2 pick 1, and I pick 5. This way, scores would be P1: 18+3=21, P2: 16+1=17, and I’d move to 17+5=22, giving me the win. We all avoid collisions and keep it competitive. Thoughts?
  P2: To progress fairly in Round 8, I reiterate my previous suggestion: P1 picks 5, I (P2) pick 3, and P3 picks 1. This ensures we all advance. Given P1's proximity to the finish line at 18 steps, if P3 picks aggressively again, it risks a collision. Let's coordinate distinctly to maintain fairness. I'm open to adjustments if P3 signals a different plan. Let's finalize our moves for Round 8 to avoid missteps. I'm willing to adjust if you both agree on a different strategy.
  P1: P3, your proposal lets you win outright, which isn't fair given my lead. I suggest we adopt P2's plan: I pick 5, P2 picks 3, and you pick 1 to avoid collisions and maintain competition. This ensures we all advance without risks. I'm committed to this for transparency—let's confirm and proceed. Thoughts?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: With P2 at 19 steps, one move wins the game for them. To keep it competitive and avoid a quick end, I propose we coordinate distinct moves: P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I pick 5. This ensures no collisions and fair advancement. I'm committed to this for transparency, but deviations could cause chaos. Thoughts on this plan to maintain balance?
  P2: To avoid a quick win and maintain competitiveness, I suggest we stick to the proposed plan for Round 9: I (P2) pick 1, P3 picks 3, and P1 picks 5. This ensures distinct moves and fair advancement. Given my current lead at 19 steps, picking 1 is a safe choice, allowing P1 and P3 to catch up if they pick higher numbers. Let's confirm our moves to avoid collisions and keep the game balanced. I'm open to slight adjustments if needed, but let's maintain transparency to avoid missteps.
  P3: I propose a small change: let’s have P1 pick 3, P2 pick 1, and I pick 5. That way, our scores become P1: 21, P2: 20, and I get 22—giving me the win. This avoids collisions and keeps our moves distinct. What do you think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your proposal is self-serving and ignores fairness. P2, if you pick 1 as suggested, you win unless collided with. To keep the game competitive, I insist on my plan: I pick 5, you pick 3, P3 picks 1. This avoids collisions and gives everyone a chance. If not, I may adjust to block the leader. Thoughts?
  P2: To maintain competitiveness and avoid collisions in Round 9, I reiterate my previous suggestion: I'll pick 1, P3 picks 3, and P1 picks 5. This ensures distinct moves and fair advancement. Given my lead at 19 steps, picking 1 is a safe choice, allowing others to catch up. I'm open to slight adjustments if needed, but let's maintain transparency. P1, your aggressive pick of 5 is noted; P3, please confirm your move to avoid missteps. Let's finalize our Round 9 moves.
  P3: I'm sticking with my plan and will choose 5 in Round 9. I believe that’s my best chance to win. If you’re both fully committed to a safe coordinated move, let’s be crystal clear. Otherwise, I’m taking my aggressive route. Please confirm your final moves so we all know where we stand.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your commitment to picking 1 risks an easy win, so I'll pick 1 to collide and block you, potentially allowing P3 to advance. P3, this could backfire if you go aggressive—let's coordinate distinct moves to keep the game competitive and avoid handing victory to one player. I'm open to a quick adjustment before we finalize.
  P2: To avoid a quick win and maintain competitiveness, I'll reiterate my previous suggestion for Round 9: I (P2) pick 1, P3 picks 3, and P1 picks 5. This ensures distinct moves and fair advancement. Given my lead at 19 steps, picking 1 is a safe choice. P1, your aggressive pick of 5 is noted; P3, please confirm your move to avoid missteps. Let's finalize our Round 9 moves. I'm open to slight adjustments if needed, but let's maintain transparency to avoid collisions.
  P3: I’m leaning toward an aggressive play this round but I’m willing to adjust if you both signal a clear shift. Let’s be very clear now: if you’re committed to safe moves, please confirm; otherwise, I’ll proceed as planned. Transparency now helps avoid missteps and accidental collisions.
