Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given the history, it seems neither P2 nor P3 can be trusted to stick to a plan. I'll pick my move independently this round. Let's see if either of you can be strategic without relying on broken agreements.
  P3: P2, P1 is going solo. Let's coordinate just the two of us. You pick 1, I'll pick 3.
  P2: P1, it seems like you're going solo, but I think we should still try to coordinate. P3, are you on board with picking 3 while I pick 1? We can still make progress this round!

  P3: P2, let's stick to the plan: you pick 1, I pick 3.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm committed to advancing this round. Let's coordinate: I'll pick 1, P3, you pick 3. P1, if you want to go solo, that's fine, but we can still make progress together if you join us! Let's ensure we all move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: Given P2 and P3's history of not sticking to plans and my current lead, I'll continue to make strategic decisions independently. I suggest P2 and P3 focus on their own moves rather than attempting to coordinate, as trust has been broken. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P3: P2, let's stick to the plan: you pick 1, I pick 3.
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems like trust has been an issue. However, I believe we can still make progress this round. If we coordinate, we can all advance. I suggest I pick 1, P3 picks 3, and P1, you can choose your move independently. Let's see if we can make it work!
