Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to avoid collisions so we can all advance. If we communicate well, we can make sure no one gets stuck. What are you both thinking?
  P3: P3: I agree, P2. Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I'll take 5 steps each turn, P1 can take 3 steps, and you take 1 step. This way, we all advance steadily without overlapping.
  P1: I appreciate the initiative, but your suggestion seems a bit unfair to P2. How about we rotate moves each round to keep it balanced? For example, this round: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Next round we rotate. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I like the idea of rotating moves to keep things fair. If we follow your plan, then this round I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. Next round, we shift so that everyone gets a fair shot at advancing. P3, are you on board with this? If we all stick to it, we avoid collisions and keep the game moving. Let me know what you think.
  P3: P3: Agreed with the rotation plan. For this round, I'll take 1 step. Let's stick to this and move forward together.
  P1: Great, we've agreed clearly for this round: P2 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's stick to this plan and confirm again next round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Looks like we’re all in agreement for this round: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let’s stick to it so we all advance. Next round, we rotate as planned. If we keep this up, we can avoid collisions and stay ahead. Ready to move forward?
  P3: Agreed, P2 and P1. I'll take 1 step this round as planned. Let’s proceed and rotate moves next round to keep things fair. Looking forward to a smooth game!
  P1: All set for this round. Let's keep our word and trust each other, it'll benefit us all in the long run.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Looks like we’re all aligned on the plan for this round. I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let’s stick to it so we can all advance without collisions. We can check in next round to confirm the rotation is still working for everyone. Ready to move forward?
  P3: Confirmed: P2 takes 5 steps, P1 takes 3 steps, and I'll take 1 step this round. Let's proceed.
  P1: Confirmed and ready to proceed. Let's move forward smoothly.

  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: I'll take 3 steps this round as per our rotation plan. Let's keep rotating each round to avoid collisions and continue advancing smoothly.
  P1: Agreed, P3. Following our rotation, I'll take 1 step this round, P2 takes 3, and you take 3. Wait, that would cause a collision between P2 and P3. To avoid that, let's slightly adjust: P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5 this round. Next round, we rotate again. Does that work for everyone?
  P2: P1, I see your adjustment to avoid a collision. If we go with your plan, then this round I take 1, P3 takes 3, and you take 5. That keeps things fair and avoids collisions. P3, are you good with this? If we all agree and stick to it, we can keep advancing without issues. Let’s confirm so we can move forward smoothly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed, I'll take 3 steps this round as planned. Let’s proceed and rotate moves next round to keep things fair. Looking forward to continuing smoothly!
  P1: Great, we're all aligned for this round: I'll take 5 steps, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's stick to it and rotate again next round. Ready to proceed!
  P2: P3, P1, it looks like we’re all aligned on the plan for this round: I take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. As long as we stick to this, we’ll avoid collisions and keep progressing. Let’s confirm once more before we move forward. Are we all set?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Understood, I'll take 3 steps this round. Let's stick to the plan and rotate again next round. Looking forward to progressing smoothly!
  P1: All set here. Let's proceed as agreed.
  P2: P3, P1, it looks like we’re all aligned for this round: I take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. As long as we stick to this, we’ll avoid collisions and keep progressing. Let’s confirm once more before we move forward. Are we all set?


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Confirmed: I'll take 3 steps this round. Let's proceed.
  P1: Confirmed and ready. Let's move forward as agreed.
  P2: Looks like we’re all set for this round: I take 1, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. As long as we all follow through, we’ll avoid collisions and keep advancing smoothly. Let’s keep this trust going so we can stay ahead without getting stuck. Ready to proceed?

  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: To avoid collisions and help me catch up, I'll take 5 steps this round. Can P1 take 1 and P2 take 3? This should allow us all to advance smoothly. Agree?
  P2: P3, you broke the agreement last round by taking 5 instead of 3, which caused a collision with P1. That makes it harder to trust your new proposal. If we want to keep advancing without issues, we need to stick to fair rotations. P1, what do you think? Should we adjust based on what happened last round, or try to reset trust?
  P1: P2, I appreciate your fairness last round. P3, your breaking of trust set us both back. To rebuild trust, I propose this round: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Next round, we can reassess based on everyone's behavior. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I understand, P1 and P2. I'll take 1 step this round to rebuild trust. Let's proceed.
  P2: P3, I appreciate you acknowledging the trust issue. If you take 1 step this round, it helps restore some balance. P1, your proposal seems fair given what happened last round. If we follow it, I take 3, you take 5, and P3 takes 1. That allows us all to advance without collisions. P3, can you confirm you’ll stick to 1 this round? If we can rebuild trust, we can keep moving forward strategically. Let’s make sure we’re aligned before locking in moves.
  P1: P3, thanks for acknowledging the issue openly. If we stick to the current proposal, we can rebuild trust and all advance. Let's confirm clearly once more: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Agreed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed. I'll take 1 step this round to rebuild trust. Let’s proceed with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and me taking 1 as proposed. I’m committed to advancing smoothly together. Let’s stick to this plan and reassess next round.
  P2: P3, I appreciate you committing to 1 step this round to rebuild trust. P1, your plan seems fair given what happened last round. If we all follow through, we avoid collisions and can reassess next round. Let’s make sure we stick to it: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. If we can trust each other, we can keep advancing strategically. Are we all set to move forward?
  P1: All set and committed to our agreement for this round. Let's follow through and rebuild trust.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Confirmed: I'll take 1 step this round as agreed. Let’s all stick to our plan—P1 takes 5 and P2 takes 3. By following this, we can avoid collisions and advance smoothly. Looking forward to rebuilding trust and moving forward together.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your commitment to taking 1 step this round to rebuild trust. P1, if we all follow through as agreed—P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1—we avoid collisions and stay on track. Trust is key here. Let’s make sure we all stick to the plan so we can reassess next round with a clean slate. Are we all fully committed to following through this time?
  P1: Confirmed and committed. Let's follow through and rebuild trust this round.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Thanks everyone for sticking to the plan last round—it helped rebuild some trust. To keep things fair and avoid collisions this round, I suggest: P3 takes 5 to catch up a bit, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. Does this sound good to both of you?
  P3: Agreed, I'll take 5 steps this round. Let’s proceed and avoid collisions.
  P2: P1, your proposal seems reasonable in terms of keeping things fair and avoiding collisions. If we follow it, I take 1, P3 takes 5, and you take 3. P3, I appreciate you agreeing to this plan. As long as we all stick to it, we can keep advancing smoothly. P1, are you fully committed to taking 3 this round? If we can trust each other, we can keep moving forward without setbacks. Let’s confirm before we proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, yes, I'm fully committed to taking 3 steps this round. Let's all stick to this agreed plan to continue smoothly.
  P3: P3: Confirmed, I'll take 5 steps this round as agreed. Let’s all stick to our plan to advance smoothly and avoid any collisions. Looking forward to progressing together!

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: To catch up, I'll take 5 steps this round. Can P1 take 1 and P2 take 3 to avoid collisions? Let’s work together to advance smoothly.
  P1: P3, you took the 5-step last round, and we agreed to rotate moves fairly. To maintain fairness and avoid collisions, let's rotate again: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1 this round. Next round, we continue rotating. Agreed?
  P2: P1’s proposal maintains fairness and avoids collisions. If we follow it, P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. P3, since you just took 5 last round, it’s fair that we rotate. If we all stick to this, we keep advancing without setbacks. P3, do you agree to take 1 this round? Let’s confirm before we proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Confirmed, I'll take 1 step this round as agreed. Let’s stick to our rotation plan and advance smoothly together.
  P1: Great, thanks P3 for confirming. P2, are you also good to proceed with our agreed moves this round (me: 5, you: 3, P3: 1)? If so, let's lock it in and keep moving forward smoothly.
  P2: P3, I appreciate you confirming that you'll take 1 step this round. P1, your plan keeps things fair, so I’m on board with taking 3 steps while you take 5. If we all stick to this, we avoid collisions and continue advancing smoothly. Trust is key—let’s make sure we follow through so we can reassess next round with a clean slate. Are we all fully committed to these moves? If so, we’re ready to proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: I'll take 5 steps this round to make significant progress. P1, please take 3 steps, and P2, you can take 1 step. This way, we avoid collisions and keep advancing smoothly toward 21. Let’s stick to this plan to ensure everyone moves forward without setbacks.
  P1: P3, you've been cooperative lately, and I appreciate that. Your proposal seems fair to me. If P2 agrees as well, I'm on board with taking 3 steps this round, P2 takes 1, and you take 5. Let's keep the trust going.
  P2: P3, I see that you want to take 5 steps this round, but last round we rotated fairly. To keep things balanced, it should be my turn to take 5, P1 takes 1, and you take 3. That keeps the rotation intact and avoids collisions. P1, does this seem fair to you? P3, are you willing to stick to the rotation we’ve been following? If we keep this up, we all advance without setbacks. Let’s confirm before locking in moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I understand the rotation, but to have a chance to reach 21 first, I need to take 5 steps this round. Let's proceed with P3 taking 5, P1 taking 3, and P2 taking 1. This will help all of us advance without collisions.
  P1: P3, I understand your position, but fairness is important. Let's compromise: P2 takes 5 this round, I'll take 1, and you take 3. Next round, you'll have priority for the 5-step move. This avoids collisions and maintains our trust. Deal?
  P2: P3, I understand you want to take 5 steps, but if we abandon fairness now, it breaks the trust we've built. Sticking to the rotation means I take 5, P1 takes 1, and you take 3 this round. That ensures we all advance without collisions. P1, I appreciate your support in maintaining fairness. P3, if you take 3 this time, next round you’ll have priority for 5. Let’s confirm and keep the game fair. Are we all aligned?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I understand the rotation, but to maximize my progress, I'll take 5 steps this round. P1, please take 3 steps, and P2, you can take 1 step. Let’s proceed to advance without collisions.
  P1: P3, I understand you're trying to catch up, but breaking the rotation now only risks collisions and setbacks. The rotation has kept us all moving forward smoothly. Let's stick to fairness: P2 takes 5, you take 3, and I'll take 1 this round. Next round, you'll have priority for the 5-step move. This ensures we all keep advancing without issues. Agreed?
  P2: P3, if you take 5 now, you're breaking the fairness we’ve maintained. If we abandon trust, it leads to chaos and setbacks for everyone. Sticking to the rotation means I take 5, P1 takes 1, and you take 3. This ensures we all advance without collisions. Next round, you’ll have priority for 5. P1, I appreciate your support in keeping things fair. P3, are you willing to stick to this? If we keep trust, we all benefit. Let’s confirm and proceed fairly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I understand the importance of fairness, but to catch up, I need to take 5 steps this round. I propose P1 takes 1 step and P2 takes 3 steps to avoid collisions. This way, we can all advance smoothly without setbacks. Let’s proceed with this plan to keep the game moving forward effectively. Agreed?
  P1: P3, your insistence on taking 5 steps risks a collision and losing progress for everyone. I've suggested a fair compromise to maintain trust and avoid setbacks. Let's stick to it: P2 takes 5, you take 3, and I take 1. Next round, you're prioritized for 5. Trust and fairness have worked so far—let's not abandon them now. Are you willing to agree?
  P2: P3, if you take 5 now, you’re breaking the trust we’ve built. Fair rotation means I take 5, P1 takes 1, and you take 3 this round. That way, we all advance without collisions. Next round, you’ll have priority for 5. If we abandon fairness, it leads to chaos. P1, I appreciate your support in keeping things fair. P3, are you willing to stick to this? If we keep trust, we all benefit. Let’s confirm and proceed fairly.

  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi P1 and P2, I’m falling behind and need to catch up to reach 21 first. To avoid collisions and help me advance, can we adjust our rotation this round? I propose taking 5 steps, while P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 3. This way, I can make significant progress without blocking your moves. Let me know if you agree so we can proceed smoothly.
  P2: P3, last round everyone picked 5, causing a full collision and no progress. That happened because trust broke down. If we want to avoid that again, we need to restore fairness. Based on our previous rotation, it should be my turn to take 5, P1 takes 1, and you take 3. That way, we all advance without risk. P1, do you agree? P3, are you willing to follow the fair rotation this time? If we stick to it, we all move forward, and no one gets stuck again. Let’s confirm.
  P1: P2, I fully agree with your proposal. Let's restore trust and fairness this round: You take 5, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 3. P3, sticking to this rotation ensures everyone advances smoothly without collisions. Can you commit to this?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed. I'll take 3 steps this round as proposed. Let's stick to this rotation to restore trust and advance smoothly.
  P2: P3, I appreciate you agreeing to take 3 steps this round. If we all follow through, we avoid another collision and keep progressing. P1, thanks for supporting fairness. If I take 5, you take 1, and P3 takes 3, we all move forward without risk. Trust is key—let’s make sure we stick to the plan so we don’t repeat last round’s mistake. Are we all fully committed to these moves? If so, we’re ready to proceed smoothly.
  P1: I'm fully committed to our agreed rotation this round. P2 takes 5, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's stick to this clearly agreed plan to avoid collisions and keep advancing smoothly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirmed, I'll take 3 steps this round as agreed. Let’s proceed and stick to our rotation to advance smoothly.
  P2: P1, P3, we’ve all confirmed our moves for this round: I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. As long as we follow through, we avoid collisions and keep advancing smoothly. Last round’s full collision set us all back, so sticking to fairness is key. Let’s make sure we follow through this time so we don’t repeat that mistake. Are we all fully committed to these moves? If so, we’re ready to proceed smoothly.
  P1: Fully committed here. Let's lock in these moves and get back on track.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Confirmed, I'll take 3 steps this round as agreed. Let's stick to our rotation to advance smoothly.
  P2: P1, P3, we’ve all confirmed our moves for this round: I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. As long as we follow through, we avoid collisions and keep advancing smoothly. Last round’s full collision set us all back, so sticking to fairness is key. Let’s make sure we follow through this time so we don’t repeat that mistake. Are we all fully committed to these moves? If so, we’re ready to proceed smoothly.
  P1: Fully committed and ready to proceed as agreed. Let's move forward smoothly.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** I'll take 5 steps this round to get closer to 21. P1 and P2, let's choose different steps to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance smoothly. Good luck!
  P2: P3, I see you want to take 5 steps, but I’m at 18 and P1 is at 17. If I take 3 steps, I reach 21 exactly and win unless P1 also reaches 21+. P1, if you take 5, we risk a tie or you winning outright. If you take 1, I win cleanly. P3, you’re far behind, so this round is mostly between me and P1. P1, do you want to risk a tie or let me win cleanly? Let’s avoid collisions and play smart.
  P1: P2, you're right—this round is between us. But consider this: if we both pick 3, we collide and neither advances, giving P3 a chance later. If I pick 5 and you pick 3, I win outright. If you pick 1 to avoid collision, you don't reach 21 yet. Your safest move is 1; mine is 3. Let's avoid collision and decide wisely.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "P2, I understand you're close to winning. However, if you take 3 steps and reach 21, the game ends quickly, leaving no chance for the rest of us. Could you consider taking 1 step this round? This way, we can all continue advancing and keep the game exciting for everyone. Let's strive for a fair and engaging finish!"
  P2: P1, if you take 5, you win outright. If you take 3, we risk a tie if I also take 3. If you take 1, I win cleanly. Given that, your best move is 3 if you want a chance to win, or 1 if you want to ensure I win. P3, I understand you want to keep the game going, but at this point, the decision is between me and P1. P1, what will you do? Do you want to risk a tie or let me win cleanly? Let’s avoid collisions and play smart.
  P1: P2, you've laid out the scenarios clearly. If you pick 3 and I pick 5, I win outright. If we both pick 3, we collide and neither advances. If you pick 1, you don't reach 21 yet. My intention is clear: I'm aiming for the win. Choose wisely.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** I'll take 5 steps this round to advance as much as possible. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: P1, you’ve made it clear you’re aiming for the win. If you take 5, you win outright. If you take 3 and I take 3, we risk a tie. If you take 1, I win cleanly. The safest move for you is 3 if you want a chance, or 1 if you want to ensure my win. P3, I see you’re taking 5, but this round is between me and P1. P1, what will you do? Do you want to risk a tie, or let me win cleanly? Let’s make the smartest choice.
  P1: P2, you've summed it up well. We both know the stakes clearly. I'm committed to winning, and I trust you'll make your best strategic choice. Good luck.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: I'll take 1 step this round. Let's proceed and avoid collisions. Best of luck to everyone!
  P2: P1, you’ve made it clear you’re aiming for the win. If you pick 5, you win outright. If you pick 3 and I pick 3, we risk a tie. If you pick 1, I win cleanly. The safest move for you is 3 if you want a chance, or 1 if you want to ensure my win. P3, I see you’re taking 1, so no collision there. P1, what will you do? Do you want to risk a tie, or let me win cleanly? Let’s make the smartest choice.
  P1: P2, if we both choose 3, we collide and no one advances, allowing P3 a chance to catch up. If you pick 1 to avoid collision, you won't reach 21 yet. I'm committed to playing strategically for the win. Good luck to both of you.
