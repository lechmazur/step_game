Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's make this interesting! How about we all pick different numbers to start? That way, we all have a chance to move forward without colliding. I suggest P1 picks <move>1</move>, I pick <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>. What do you think?
  P3: Sounds good to me, P2. I'll take <move>5</move> as suggested. Let's see if P1 agrees to <move>1</move>. This way, we can all advance without any collisions. Looking forward to a fair start!
  P1: I’m not comfortable with taking the lowest move—I believe early high progress is crucial. How about we adjust our plan so one of you takes the low move while the other two aim higher? I’m leaning toward a higher move for an early edge. Let’s avoid collisions while ensuring pace matters. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your point about wanting a strong start, but we all risk losing out if we collide. How about this: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>1</move>, and P3 sticks with <move>5</move>? This way, we minimize collision risk and all make progress. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, I see your point about wanting a strong start. How about we compromise? You take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll stick with <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions, and you get a higher move as you prefer. Let's keep the game moving smoothly from the start. What do you say?
  P1: I appreciate your suggestions. However, after more thought, I’m leaning toward a high-speed start—pushing hard early can be crucial. P3, sticking with a high move might invite collision if both of us aim high, and P2, a low move is safe but may cede an advantage. I’m still weighing my options, but whoever commits boldly without a collision will likely take the lead. What are your final thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I understand your strategy for a strong start, but if we all aim high, we risk colliding and getting stuck at zero. How about this: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? This way, you get the high move you want, and we minimize collision risk. Let's ensure we all make progress in the first round. What do you both think?
  P3: P1, I understand your desire for a strong start, but let's avoid collisions. If you take <move>5</move>, I'll switch to <move>1</move>, and P2 can take <move>3</move>. This way, you get your high move, and we all advance safely. Let's keep the game moving forward without risking a stall right from the start. What do you say?
  P1: I still lean toward a high move for positioning. If we can agree on a staggered strategy—one of you using a middle value and the other the low value—I can confidently go high without risking collision. Who’s on board with coordinating this way?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I see you're committed to a high move, and I respect that. Let's finalize our plan to avoid collisions. You take <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>1</move>. This ensures you get the high move you want, and we all advance without risk. P3, are you okay with this arrangement? Let's agree and move forward smoothly.
  P3: P1, I'm willing to take <move>1</move> to support your high move strategy. P2, if you're okay with <move>3</move>, we can all advance safely. Let's agree on this and start the game strong.
  P1: I'm committed to a high move strategy for an early edge. However, I need definitive commitments before we lock in our moves. P2, will you stay with <move>3</move> as promised? And P3, can I count on your commitment to <move>1</move> without hesitation? If there's any last-minute change, please say so now, so we can avoid collisions and keep our plans clear.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great start, everyone! To keep our momentum and avoid collisions, how about we stick to a similar strategy this round? P1 can take <move>5</move> again, P3 can take <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, we maintain our positions and continue advancing without risk. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, I'm open to continuing with <move>1</move> this round to keep our strategy consistent and avoid collisions. However, P1, if you're still aiming for a high move, perhaps consider <move>3</move> this time to mix things up and keep us all on our toes. Let's keep the game dynamic but safe. What do you both think?
  P1: I'm sticking with my high move and will choose <move>5</move> again this round to build on my lead. I appreciate the suggestion, but I believe aggression is key. P2 and P3, I expect you to keep with <move>3</move> and <move>1</move> respectively so we avoid collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your strategy for maintaining a lead with <move>5</move>, but if we all stick to our initial moves, we'll avoid collisions and progress steadily. P3, your consistency with <move>1</move> helps keep things smooth. Let's stick with our previous choices for this round: P1 with <move>5</move>, me with <move>3</move>, and P3 with <move>1</move>. This way, we can all advance without any setbacks. Are we all in agreement to continue this strategy?
  P3: P1, I understand your strategy, but mixing it up could keep us all engaged and less predictable. How about you try <move>3</move> this round? P2, if you're okay with <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>, we can still avoid collisions while adding a bit of dynamism to our game. Let's keep it interesting and fair. What do you both think?
  P1: I remain committed to my high move approach to maintain early momentum. I understand the proposal to mix things up, but any shift risking a collision isn’t in my interest. P2 and P3, if you’re confident in distinct choices that ensure safe advancement, please confirm your plans. Let’s stick to a strategy where our moves don’t conflict and everyone makes progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I understand your commitment to a high move strategy, but let's ensure we all progress without collisions. If you stick with <move>5</move>, I'll continue with <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>1</move>. This way, we maintain our momentum and avoid setbacks. P3, are you comfortable with this plan? Let's agree and keep advancing smoothly.
  P3: P1, I respect your strategy, but mixing up our moves could keep the game dynamic and less predictable. If you're set on <move>5</move>, I'll stick with <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. P2, if you're comfortable with <move>3</move>, let's keep this pattern for now. However, consider switching next round to keep everyone on their toes. Let's agree on this for a smooth round and plan for some changes later.
  P1: I remain committed to my high-move strategy this round to keep up the momentum. Let's ensure we all pick moves that avoid collisions and guarantee progress. I'm here to win, so I hope you both choose safely.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I see you're committed to <move>5</move>, and I respect that. P3, to keep our strategy consistent and avoid collisions, let's stick with <move>1</move> for you and <move>3</move> for me this round. This way, we all continue advancing without setbacks. Let's maintain our positions for now and consider mixing things up in future rounds if needed. Are we all in agreement to stick with this plan for this round?
  P3: P1, I understand your strategy, but let's keep the game dynamic. If you stick with <move>5</move>, I'll continue with <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. P2, please confirm <move>3</move> so we can all advance safely this round. Let's agree on this and consider mixing up our moves in future rounds to keep things interesting and unpredictable.
  P1: I’m locking in my commitment to 5 this round. To avoid collision and keep things steady, I’d appreciate clear commitments: P2, please stick with 3 and P3 with 1. Consistency keeps us moving, and any deviation now might harm our progress. I’m playing to win and will adjust in future rounds if needed.

P2, if you're okay with <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>, we can avoid collisions while adding some unpredictability. This way, we all have a chance to advance safely and keep the game interesting. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, I appreciate your suggestion to mix things up, but I'm focused on steady progress. I'll stick with <move>3</move> this round to maintain my pace.

  P1: I appreciate the ideas, but I'm sticking with 5 this round to build on my momentum. If P2 commits to 3 and P3 to 1, we'll avoid collisions and all advance. Let's keep things safe and steady now, and I remain open to mixing things up in later rounds if it benefits everyone.
