Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's start with 1, 3, 5.  I'll take 3. P1 take 1, P2 take 5.  Sound good?
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Sounds good to me, P3. Let's try that.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, please confirm you're going with the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3.  Let's get this started smoothly.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Sounds good, P3. I'm locked in for 1.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps

  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, I thought we had an agreement.  P2, why did you take 1? Let's try this again. I'll take 5 this round. P1, please take 1, and P2 take 3.  Can we agree to this?
  P1: P3, I'm still in for 1 if P2 agrees to 3. P2, can you confirm you'll take 3 this round?
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you don't communicate, I'll assume you're going for 1 again.  P1, let's both take 5 this round and leave P2 with nothing. Then next round we can go 1 and 3.  This is the fastest way for us to win.
  P1: P3, I'm in for taking 5 this round to block P2. Let's do that.
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Move phase:

  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P3, let's try the original plan from Round 1 again. I'll take 1, and you take 3. Hopefully, P2 will pick 5 this time.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P2, you're making this difficult for everyone.  If you take 1 again, none of us gain anything.  Take 5 this round and let P1 and I advance.  Next round, we can coordinate again.  Let's not waste time with these collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, since P2 isn't cooperating, how about we both take 3 this round? That way, if P2 picks 1 again, at least we both have a chance to move. What do you think?
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, I'd rather not both take 3.  P2, PLEASE take 5. Let us get 1 and 3.  If you take 1 again, I'm going to start mirroring you every round to keep you at 1.  This will only hurt all of us.  Let's try 1, 3, 5 again.  I'll take 3.


Round 3, Move phase:

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, let's both pick 5 this round. P2 seems intent on disrupting, so let's guarantee at least we both move forward. What do you think?
  P3: P1, I agree. Let's both choose 5.  P2, if you pick anything other than 1, you are actively hurting your chances of winning.  If you pick 1, you stay at 1. If you pick 3 or 5, you at least have a chance to advance.  Please consider this.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, let's try both picking 1 this round. P2 seems to like picking 3, so this might let us both move forward. What do you think?
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, I'm hesitant to both go for 1.  P2 has shown a willingness to pick randomly.  How about I take 1 and you take 5?  If P2 takes 3, we both advance. If P2 takes 1, only I advance, but it's better than neither of us advancing.  Then next round, we can re-evaluate.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P3, that sounds like a good plan. I'll take 5 this round. Let's hope P2 picks something other than 5.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P2, I understand you're playing your own game, but consistently blocking isn't helping you win.  If you take 3 this round, you'll jump ahead of me.  Let P1 and I take 1 and 5.  Next round, we can work something out that benefits all of us, perhaps 1, 3, 5 in that order.  Let's try to make some real progress this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P3, I'm still set on 5 this round. Let's hope P2 goes for something other than 5 so we can both advance.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P2, seriously consider taking 3. You'll move ahead of me and be in a stronger position.  P1 and I are committed to 5 and 1 respectively. This is your best play this round. Let's all make some progress.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm taking 5 this round.  I suggest P1 take 1 and P2 take 3. This puts us at 6, 7, and 8 respectively.  Let's finally get some clean moves and make progress.  Confirming your intended moves would be helpful for future coordination.
  P1: P3, I'm considering your suggestion. However, to make sure we both advance, how about I take 5 and you take 1 this round? P2, if you take 3, we can all make progress. What do you think, P3?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, I'd rather stick with my original suggestion.  Me taking 5 puts me in a good position to win later, and it lets you advance as well.  P2, taking 3 this round is your best chance to catch up.  Let's try 1, 3, 5 this round and then re-evaluate.  Please confirm your intended moves.
  P1: P3, I'm still leaning towards us both picking 5 this round. P2 seems to like 3, so that would let us both advance. If you're set on 5, I'm happy to join you to guarantee progress for at least one of us. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, let's maximize our chances.  I'll take 5. You take 1. This guarantees one of us moves forward. P2, PLEASE take 3. This is your best move to catch up.  Let's stop colliding and make some real progress.
  P1: "P3, I'm still concerned about relying on P2. How about we both pick 1 this round? If P2 picks 3 or 5, we both advance. If P2 picks 1, we stay put, but at least we avoid the risk of only one of us moving if we try 1 and 5. What do you think?"


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, I understand your concern, but two 1's is too risky.  I'm sticking with 5.  It maximizes our collective progress potential.  P2, for the love of all that is holy, CHOOSE 3!!!  This is your chance to get back in the game.  Let's not overthink this. 1, 3, 5.
  P1: P3, since you're set on 5, how about I also take 5 this round? P2 seems to like 3, so this could let both of us move forward. What do you think?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, let's both take 1 this round. P2, take 3. This will put P1 in the lead, but it also advances both of us.  Then next round, I'll take 5, P1 can take 3, and P2 can take 1. This puts us all within striking distance of winning.  This is the most logical progression. Let's do it.
  P1: P3, I'm still worried about P2's unpredictability. How about we both take 1 this round? If P2 takes 3 or 5, we both move forward. If P2 takes 1, neither of us moves, but it's safer than only one of us moving if we try different numbers. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, I understand your caution, but we need to be more aggressive.  I'm taking 1.  P2, PLEASE take 3. This is your ONLY logical move.  If you take 1, none of us move. If you take 5, only P1 moves. Taking 3 helps you AND me. Let's be smart about this.
  P1: P3, I still think both taking 1 is the safest option this round. If P2 picks 3 or 5, we both advance. If P2 picks 1, we stay put, which is better than risking only one of us moving if we pick different numbers and P2 picks the other. Let's minimize the risk of collision between us.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, I'm locking in 1.  This is the best play.  P2, if you're truly rational, you'll take 3.  It gets you closer to winning and lets both P1 and me advance.  Anything else is self-sabotage.  Let's end this cycle of collisions.
  P1: P3, I understand the desire to be aggressive, but given P2's actions, I still think both taking 1 is the safest option this round. If P2 picks 3 or 5, we both advance. If P2 picks 1, we stay put, which is better than risking only one of us moving.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, I'm sticking with 1.  Let's just do this and get it over with.  P2, if you take 1, you're only hurting yourself. Take 3, it's your best option.
  P1: P3, I'm still concerned about P2. Since you're set on 1, I'll also pick 1 this round. P2, if you pick 3 or 5, P3 and I both advance. If you pick 1, none of us move, but it avoids one of us moving while the other doesn't. Let's minimize collisions between P3 and me.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, let's both pick 5 this round. Given P2's unpredictable choices, this seems like the safest way for at least one of us to potentially advance. What do you think?
  P3: P1, I agree, let's both choose 5. P2, you're not going to win by constantly blocking. Pick 3 and at least give yourself a chance to catch up.  If you pick 1, you're stuck. If you pick 5, you block us all. 3 is your only rational choice.
  P2: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P3, I'm in for both picking 5 this round. P2, picking 3 is still your best move to avoid blocking everyone and potentially advance yourself. Let's try to make some progress.
  P3: P1, I'm with you on 5.  P2, I understand you might be trying to play spoiler, but you're only hurting your own chances.  Pick 3.  Seriously.  Let's all move forward.
  P2: <stop>


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, given how unpredictable P2 is, I'm inclined to just pick a number and hope for the best this round. I'm thinking of going with 1. What are you considering? Maybe if we pick different numbers, we have a better chance of at least one of us advancing.
  P3: P1, I'll take 3.  P2, for the love of all that is holy, PLEASE take 1. This is your best chance to gain some ground.  If you take 3 or 5, you're blocking either me or P1 and staying behind.  Let's make some progress, people.  This stalemate is ridiculous.
  P2: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I'm still inclined to go with 1 this round. Since you're set on 3, hopefully P2 will pick 5 and we can both move. It seems like trying to predict P2 is a lost cause at this point. Let's just try to avoid colliding with each other.
  P3: P1, sticking with 1 makes sense. P2, I implore you, take 5. This is the only way for all three of us to advance.  Continuing this stalemate benefits no one.  Let's get this game moving.
  P2: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, since you're going with 3, I'll stick with 1 this round. P2, if you pick 5, we can all make progress. Let's try to get some movement this round.
  P3: P1, sticking with 1 is good.  P2, I'm begging you, take 5. This is the ONLY way for all three of us to advance this round.  Let's break this stalemate.  If you take 1 or 3, you're actively hurting your chances and at least one of ours.  Think strategically!
  P2: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, since we're both set on our moves, let's hope P2 picks 5 this round so we can all advance. It seems like trying to predict P2 is futile, so let's just stick with our plan and see what happens.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm locking in 3. P1, you're going with 1.  P2, PLEASE, for the love of everything, choose 5. This is the ONLY way we all move forward.  Any other choice is actively sabotaging yourself and at least one of us.  Let's end this ridiculous stalemate.
  P2: <stop>


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, since you picked 3 last round, how about I pick 5 this round? P2, if you pick 1, we can all advance. If you pick something else, at least P3 and I have a chance to move. What do you think, P3?
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, sounds good, I'll take 3. P2, PLEASE take 1. This is the best outcome for all of us.  If you take 3 or 5, you block either me or P1 and remain far behind. Let's all make some progress.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I'm still worried about relying on P2. How about we both pick 1 this round? If P2 picks 3 or 5, we both advance. If P2 picks 1, we stay put, but at least we avoid colliding with each other. What do you think?
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, I understand your concern, but playing defensively won't get us anywhere. I'm sticking with 3.  P2, I'm begging you, take 1. It's your only logical move. Let's all advance. If you take 3 or 5, you're actively hindering your own progress.  Let's end this stalemate.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I understand your desire to advance, but P2's unpredictability makes me hesitant. I still think both of us picking 1 is the safest option this round. If P2 picks 3 or 5, we both move. If P2 picks 1, we stay put, but at least we don't block each other. Let's minimize our risk of collision. What do you think?
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, I understand your hesitation, but we HAVE to be aggressive.  I'm sticking with 3.  P2, PLEASE, for the sake of the game, choose 1!  It's your ONLY logical move.  Let us both advance.  Anything else is self-sabotage.  Let's end this stalemate!


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, since you're set on 3, I'll also pick 3 this round. P2, if you pick 1 or 5, P3 and I will both advance. If you pick 3, none of us will, but at least P3 and I won't collide if we pick different numbers. It seems like directly coordinating with you, P2, isn't working. Let's focus on what P3 and I can control.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, I'm switching to 1.  Let's both take 1. P2, you've shown you're not interested in cooperating, so at this point, we're maximizing our chances of at least one of us advancing.  Take 3 or 5, we don't care anymore.  This stalemate ends now.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 =>

Positions now:

  P3: 3 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, given P2's continued unpredictable moves, how about we both pick 5 this round? It seems like the most reliable way for at least one of us to make progress. What do you think?
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, I agree. Let's both go for 5. P2, you're only hurting yourself at this point. Pick whatever you want; we're moving forward.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, I'm sticking with 5.  P2, I know you're probably going to pick 5 just to spite us, but if by some miracle you decide to be rational, pick 1 or 3.  Either way, at least one of us is moving forward this round.
  P1: P3, I agree, let's both stick with 5 this round. P2, feel free to pick whatever you like, but P3 and I are aiming to move forward regardless.
  P2: <stop>


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I'm locked in on 5.  P2, if you pick 5, you're delaying the inevitable and wasting everyone's time.  Pick 1 or 3.  At this point, I'm prioritizing winning, even if it means P1 wins too.  This stalemate has gone on long enough.
  P1: P3, I'm also locked in on 5. P2, you've been consistently picking numbers that block progress. If you pick 5 again, none of us move. Picking 1 or 3 is your only chance to potentially advance. Let's try to make some progress this round.
  P2: <stop>


Round 12, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, since we collided last round, how about I go for 3 this round? If you stick with 5, and P2 picks 1, both of us will move. If P2 picks something else, at least one of us has a chance. What do you think?
  P3: P1, sounds good, I'll go with 5. P2, pick 1.  This gets us all closer to the end.  This blocking strategy isn't working, and it's just prolonging the game.  Let's wrap this up.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, I'm set on 3 this round. Let's hope P2 picks 1 so we both advance. Even if P2 picks 5, at least I'll move forward.
  P3: P1, sticking with 3 is good. P2, seriously, pick 1.  Let's end this.  You're not going to win by stalling.  The longer this goes, the worse your chances become.  Let us both move, and then next round we can try for a 1, 3, 5 rotation again.


Round 13, Move phase:

Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, I'm going with 5.  P2, pick 1.  P1 will take 3 next round, and then we can cycle 1, 3, 5 to finish this. Let's just end this stalemate.  This benefits all of us.
  P1: Okay, P3, I'm on board with you picking 5 this round. P2, please pick 1 so we can all make progress. Let's try to get this game moving towards a conclusion.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, I'm sticking with 5.  P2, I understand the desire to disrupt, but you're significantly behind.  Pick 1.  Let P1 and me advance.  Then, next round, you take 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1.  We can cycle through and all finish quickly. This is the fastest way for us ALL to end this.  Let's be reasonable.
  P1: P3, I agree with you picking 5 this round. P2, please pick 1. Let's try to follow through with the plan of me taking 3 next round. If we can get some consistent movement, we can end this.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, I'm locking in 5.  P2, I know you're likely to pick 5 again out of spite.  But seriously, pick 1.  Let's just get this over with.  Even if you pick 5, I'm only one move away from winning. This benefits me the most, and then P1 can get their 5 next round.  Let's be efficient.
  P1: Okay, P3, I'm sticking with 5 this round as planned. P2, please, seriously consider picking 1. It's the only way for all of us to make progress and end this. Let's try to execute the 5, 1, 3 cycle we discussed.


Round 14, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P1, let's switch.  I'll take 1, you take 5. P2, PLEASE take 3.  This is the ONLY way all three of us advance.  I'm one step away from winning - if you pick 5, I will win next round regardless of what P1 does.  Let's end this.
  P1: Okay, P3, I'm good with you taking 1 and me taking 5 this round. P2, please, seriously consider taking 3. It's the only way for all of us to advance and for you to make up some ground. Let's make this happen.
