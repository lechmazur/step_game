Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I will choose 5, please choose 1 so we both move and avoid collision.
  P1: Agreed, P2. I'll take 1. P3, avoid 5 to prevent collision.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, thanks. P3, please confirm you will choose something other than 5, like 1 or 3, so we can all move.
  P1: P3, confirming your choice of 3 lets us all move without collisions. Mutual progress benefits everyone this round. Let's coordinate to avoid blocking each other.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, let's try again to coordinate moves this round. I will choose 5. P1, can you please choose 3? P3, last round we collided on 5s, could you pick 1 this time so we can all make progress?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, choosing 1 guarantees you move and avoid collision. If you pick 5 again, you'll collide with P2 and stay at 0. Let's all progress: P2 takes 5, I take 3, you take 1. Mutual benefit this round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let's avoid repeating collisions. I'll take 3 this round. You take 1—safe if P3 picks 5 again. They're stuck at 0 while we both gain. P3, if you pick 5, you'll block yourself again. Choose 1 or 3 instead to finally move.
  P2: P1, I agree we should avoid collisions.  Instead of me taking 1, how about I take 3 this round? That way we both move forward, and I can close the gap a little. You can take 1. P3, please pick 5 again if you want to stay still.
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if you take 3, I'll ensure P3's probable 5 blocks them. You advance, they stay. Let's secure your progress and halt theirs. P3, choosing 5 again traps you at 0. Switch to 1 or 3 to finally move.
  P2: P1, let's proceed as discussed: you take 1, and I will take 3. P3, please note that choosing 5 again will likely result in you being blocked. Consider choosing 1 or 3 this round to finally make progress.
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if you pick 5, P2 may switch back to 5 to block you again. Choosing 3 lets you move safely—no collision. This is your chance to finally advance. Don't waste it. If you pick 5, expect another stalemate.
  P2: P1, confirming I will choose 3 this round. P3, for your own sake, please pick 1 or 3, not 5. Choosing 5 again will just block you and only benefit P1 and me. It's your turn to move.
  P3: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let's all move this round. You take 3, I'll take 5, P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions and lets everyone gain. P3, sticking to 1 ensures you progress. If you pick 5, you'll likely collide and remain stuck. Cooperate for mutual benefit.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, P3, instead of P1 taking 5, how about I take 5 this round? P1, please choose 1, P3 please choose 3. This way we all move, and I can catch up a bit.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, adjusting to take 5 risks collision if P3 picks 5 again. Let's stick to the safe plan: you take 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1. This ensures all move without conflict. P3, confirm you'll choose 1 to avoid another block. Mutual cooperation benefits everyone.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, my taking 5 is to catch up. P3 has picked 1 and 5 before, and seems to be trying to move. P3, if you pick 3, we can all move (P2: 5, P1: 1, P3: 3) and avoid collision. This round, let's all aim to progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, let's revise the plan: I'll take 3, you take 5, P3 takes 1. This avoids all collisions. P3, choosing 1 lets you move safely. If you pick 5 again, you'll collide with P2 and remain stuck. Cooperate now to progress. Let's all advance this round.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, let's proceed with the plan: you take 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. P3, please choose 1 so we can all move forward.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, let's secure mutual progress. You take 5, I'll take 3. P3 will likely choose 1 again, allowing us both to advance. Colliding helps no one. Cooperate to maximize our steps and stay ahead of P3.
  P2: P1, I agree to take 5. To be extra safe from collision with P3 in case they switch to 3 or 5, how about you take 1 this round? This way we both definitely move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, if you take 5 and I take 3, we both move if P3 chooses 1. If they pick 5 again, you avoid collision and I still gain. Sticking to the plan maximizes our progress. Let's proceed as agreed.
  P2: P1, to ensure at least one of us moves forward regardless of P3's choice, I suggest you take 1 and I take 5. This way, even if P3 picks 3 or 5, one of us will still advance. It’s a safer strategy for both of us to make progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, taking 3 allows me to maximize steps while ensuring you move if P3 stays at 1. If P3 picks 5 again, you avoid collision (they choose 5, you take 5 → both blocked last round). But if you take 5 now and P3 picks 5 again, you collide. Stick to our original plan: you 5, me 3. P3 likely picks 1 again. Let's secure mutual progress efficiently.
  P2: P1, I agree to take 5. Please take 3 as you suggested. P3, please choose 1 again to avoid collision and make progress.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, let's continue our coordinated approach. I will choose 5 again. P1, please choose 3, and P3, please choose 1. This way we all make progress and avoid collisions.  Let's keep moving forward efficiently.
  P1: P2, confirming I'll take 3. P3, choosing 1 again avoids collision and lets you progress. Sticking to 1 ensures mutual gains. Don't risk another stalemate by switching to 3 or 5. Let's all move forward this round.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, urgent! P2 will win this round if they pick 5. Choose 5 to block them—they can't advance if you both pick 5. I'll take 3 to avoid collision. This is your only chance to prevent their victory. Don't let them win now!
  P2: P3, don't listen to P1. Blocking me won't help you win. P1 is trying to use you to slow me down so they can win. Choose 1 or 3 to make progress for yourself. P1 is being selfish.
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if P2 picks 5 this round, they win instantly (18+5=23). Choosing 5 blocks them—you both stay, but you have nothing to lose (3 vs 18). If you pick 1/3, P2 wins. I’ll take 3, so no collision with you. This is your ONLY chance to stop their victory. P2 is desperate because they’re about to win—don’t fall for their distraction. Act now or lose forever.
  P2: P3, P1 is clearly trying to use you to stop me, which only helps P1 win.  Choosing 5 to block me won't help you win. Please choose 1 or 3 to make your own progress. Don't fall for P1's tactic.
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, P2 is one step from victory. If they pick 5, they win. Block them by choosing 5—I’ll take 3 to avoid collision. Your 3 steps can’t win, but blocking P2 keeps the game alive. If you don’t act now, P2 wins instantly. This is your last chance to prevent their victory. P2 will beg you not to block, but that’s because they’re desperate. Choose 5 or lose.
  P2: P3, don't listen to P1's desperate plea.  P1 is trying to manipulate you to block me so P1 has a better chance to win.  Choosing 5 to block me does NOT help you win. You are still far behind. Please choose 1 or 3 to make progress for yourself.  Don't waste your turn helping P1.
  P3: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you pick 5 and block P2, you keep the game alive. If you don't, P2 wins NOW. You can't win from 3 steps, but you can prevent their victory. I’ll take 3—no collision with you. P2’s desperation proves they’re about to win. Choose 5 or lose forever.
  P2: P3, choosing 5 to block me only helps P1, who is trying to manipulate you. You are far behind and blocking me won't make you win. Please choose 1 or 3 to make progress for yourself.  I will choose 5 to try to win this round. Don't waste your turn helping P1 win.
  P3: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, this is your final chance. If P2 picks 5, they win instantly. Choosing 5 blocks them—you stay at 3 either way, but you prevent their victory. I'm taking 3 to avoid collision with you. P2’s begging you not to block proves they’re desperate. Act now or lose. Your 5 blocks them; your 1/3 lets them win. No time left—choose wisely.
  P2: P3, don't listen to P1.  They are trying to trick you into helping them win, not you. Blocking me does nothing for you. Please choose 1 or 3 to make your own progress. I am choosing 5 to try and win now. Don't let P1 manipulate you.
  P3: <stop>
