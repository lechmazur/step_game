Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let's try to avoid collisions right from the start. I suggest we each pick a different number this round to ensure we all advance. I’m leaning towards one of the options, but I won’t say which just yet. How about you two? Any preference on which number you’d like to choose? Let’s coordinate to maximize our chances of moving forward.
  P2: Agreed, P1, coordination could help us all advance initially. I'm thinking of picking 5 to start, but I'm flexible if it avoids collisions. P3, what's your preference? Let's ensure we cover all options.
  P3: Okay, I'm also for coordination in the beginning. If P2 is considering 5, I can choose 3. P1, would you be okay with picking 1 then for this round?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, great job avoiding collisions last round! Let’s keep the momentum going. I’m open to picking any number this time, but I’d like to hear your thoughts first. P2, since you’re in the lead, any preference? P3, what about you? I think if we communicate clearly, we can all advance again. Let’s aim for another smooth round.
  P2: Agreed, P1, coordination worked well last round. I'm preferring to pick 5 again to keep my lead, but I'm flexible to avoid collisions. P3, what's your thought—do you want 5 or something else? Let's ensure we all advance smoothly.
  P3: P2, while coordinating is helpful, you gained a lead by picking 5 last round. To keep things balanced, perhaps I should pick 5 this round? What are your thoughts on that? P1, your input would be great too.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate the discussion. P3, I understand your point about balancing things out. I’m fine with you taking 5 this round if P2 is okay with switching. P2, would you consider picking 3 or 1 instead to avoid a collision? I’m flexible and can take whichever number is left. Let’s aim for another round where we all advance if possible. What do you both think?
  P2: Sounds good, P1. P3, I'll switch to 3 this round to let you have 5 and avoid a collision. P1, you can take 1 as suggested. This way, we all advance smoothly. What do you both think?
  P3: Okay, sounds like we're all set for P1 to pick 1, P2 to pick 3, and I'll pick 5 this round. Let's do it.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, for this round, let's continue our successful coordination.  P1, could you pick 1, and P2, could you pick 3? I will choose 5 again this round. This way we can all keep advancing.
  P2: P3, your suggestion gives you another 5, putting you at 13 while I'm at 11—that's not fair after I let you have it last round. Let's rotate: I'll pick 5 this time, you pick 3, and P1 can pick 1. This keeps us balanced and all advancing. What do you think, P1 and P3?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I agree we should keep things balanced. P2, I’m okay with you taking 5 this round since it’s fair to rotate. P3, if you’re fine with 3, I’ll stick to 1 again to avoid any collisions. This way, we all advance, and no one pulls too far ahead just yet. Let’s keep the coordination going for now. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P2, your rotation idea sounds fair for this round. I'm okay with picking 3 if you pick 5 and P1 picks 1. Let's do that.
  P2: Agreed, P3, the rotation plan is fair for this round. P1 on 1, me on 5, you on 3—should avoid collisions and let us all progress. Let's stick to coordination while it benefits us.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re keeping the rotation idea for balance. I’m fine sticking with 1 this round as discussed. Let’s maintain this coordination to ensure we all advance again. If everyone agrees, we’re set for another smooth turn. Any last thoughts before we finalize?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, the rotation plan sounds good to me too. P1 will pick 1, P2 will pick 5, and I will pick 3. Let's proceed with this plan for this round.
  P2: Agreed, P3 and P1, the rotation plan is solid for this round—I'll pick 5, you pick 3, and P1 on 1. It's keeping us all advancing without issues. As we get closer to 23, we should stay coordinated to avoid risks. I'm set with this.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligned on the rotation plan for this round. I’ll stick with 1 as agreed, ensuring we avoid collisions. Let’s keep this fair approach for now, but as we near 23, we might need to rethink our strategy. I’m open to discussing any adjustments next round if needed. For now, I think we’re set. Any final thoughts before we move forward?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Hey P1 and P3, with me at 13 and you at 11, P3, let's keep coordination smooth to avoid stalling. I suggest I pick 5 again to build my lead, you take 3, P3, and P1 on 1 as before. This way, we all advance without issues. As P1 said, we can revisit strategy closer to 23. What do you both think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I see P2’s suggestion to stick with the same pattern, but I’m concerned it’s widening the gap. P2, you’d hit 18 with another 5, while I’m still at 3. How about we rotate again? I’d like to pick 5 this round, P3 can take 3, and P2, you take 1. This keeps us closer in steps and maintains fairness. We’re still far from 23, so let’s balance now before it gets tight. What do you both think? I’m open to other ideas if this doesn’t work.
  P3: Okay, P1's idea of rotating to P1 picking 5, P3 picking 3, and P2 picking 1 sounds good to me. It does balance things out a bit better this round. P2, what do you think of switching to 1 this round to let P1 catch up a little?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Look, P1 and P3, I'm not keen on picking 1 and falling behind in my lead. How about a fair compromise: I take 3 this round, you pick 5 to catch up, P1, and P3, you take 1? This balances things without stalling me too much. We can rotate again next time if needed. What do you both think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate the compromise suggestion, P2. I’m okay with picking 5 this round as you proposed, and P3 taking 1 works for me. P2, you taking 3 keeps things somewhat balanced while still letting you advance. I think this is a fair middle ground for now, and we can rotate again next round to ensure no one falls too far behind. Let’s stick with this for the current turn. Any objections or other ideas before we finalize? I’m set if you both are.
  P3: Okay, P2's compromise of P2 picking 3, P1 picking 5, and P3 picking 1 sounds acceptable for this round to keep the peace. I agree to pick 1.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Agreed, P1 and P3, the compromise works for this round—I'll pick 3, you take 5 P1, and you handle 1 P3. It keeps us advancing without drama. As we approach 23, we might need to adjust strategy, but for now, let's stick to this. I'm set.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’ve reached a compromise for this round with me on 5, P2 on 3, and P3 on 1. It feels like a balanced move for now, and I appreciate the cooperation. Let’s stick to this plan to ensure we all advance again. As we’re still a bit away from 23, keeping things fair benefits us all before the final stretch. I’m set with this arrangement. Any last thoughts or adjustments before we move forward? If not, I’m ready.
  P3: Okay, the compromise works for this round. But we're nearing the win, so individual strategies soon. P2=3, P1=5, P3=1 this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Agreed, P3, I'll stick to picking 3 as planned for this round to keep things smooth. You're right about individual strategies looming, so let's execute this compromise and reassess our approach next turn when we're closer to 23. For now, coordination serves us well.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’ve settled on this compromise for the round with me on 5, P2 on 3, and P3 on 1. It keeps us moving forward while staying relatively balanced. As P3 mentioned, we’re nearing the endgame, so let’s stay sharp and reassess next turn. I’m committed to this plan for now and hope we all stick to it to avoid collisions. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m ready to proceed. Any final input before we lock this in? If not, .
  P3: Okay, confirming: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and I pick 1 for this round. Let's make these moves and then discuss strategy for the next round as we're getting closer to the target.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your betrayal last round by picking 3 instead of 1 cost me progress and broke trust. For this round, to salvage coordination, I propose I pick 5 to maintain my lead, P1 you take 3, and P3 you take 1 as compensation. P1, what do you think? If we can't agree, things might get messy. Let's discuss.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m disappointed in the collision last round, as it stalled progress for some of us. P2, I understand your frustration and proposal, but I’d like a chance to pick 5 this round to close the gap, since I’m behind at 8. How about P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 to make up for last round? This keeps us advancing and somewhat balanced. As we’re nearing 23, let’s try one more coordinated round before individual strategies kick in. What do you both think? I’m open to alternatives.
  P3: Sorry about the collision last round, P2.  Wasn't intentional.  P1's idea of P2 taking 3 and P1 taking 5 is reasonable to balance things. To also ensure I can keep pace, could I also pick 3 this round?  That way we all move and I close the gap slightly. What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your apology is appreciated, but trust is broken after last round's betrayal. I insist on my proposal: I pick 5 to maintain lead, P1 you take 3, and P3 you take 1 as fair compensation. This avoids collisions and lets us all advance. P1, if you push for 5, we risk a messy tie or stall. Let's coordinate one more time for everyone's benefit. What do you both think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I hear P2’s concern about maintaining the lead and the need for trust after last round. However, I’m still behind at 8, so I’d like to stick with picking 5 this round to catch up. P2, if you take 3 and P3 takes 1, we can all advance without collisions. Let’s aim for one last coordinated effort before the endgame. If we can’t agree, stalling becomes a risk for everyone. What do you both think? I’m ready to finalize if we’re aligned.
  P3: Okay, P1's suggestion of P2 picking 3 and P1 picking 5 sounds reasonable to balance things out. I'm okay with picking 1 this round as part of this plan. Let's do this to avoid another collision and keep us all advancing.  Hopefully this clears the air from last round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I appreciate your apology, but actions speak louder than words after last round's betrayal. P1, I'll reluctantly agree to pick 3 this round to ensure we all advance and avoid chaos—you on 5, me on 3, P3 on 1. This keeps me at a safe lead, but trust is fragile. Next round, with 23 looming, expect me to push harder for my win. Let's execute this and move on.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re leaning towards a plan with me on 5, P2 on 3, and P3 on 1. This feels like a fair way to keep us all moving forward while I catch up a bit. Let’s stick to this to avoid any collisions this round. With 23 getting closer, this might be our last coordinated move, so let’s make it count. I’m set with this arrangement. Any final concerns or adjustments before we proceed? If not, I’m ready to move on.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's proceed with the agreed plan: P1=5, P2=3, and P3=1 for this round. I'm sticking to 1. Let's make our moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Agreed, P1 and P3, I'll stick to picking 3 as planned for this round to keep us advancing. Your coordination efforts are noted, but with 23 looming, trust is thin—expect me to prioritize my win next time. Let's execute this and reassess.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’ve agreed on me picking 5, P2 on 3, and P3 on 1 for this round. This keeps us all advancing and maintains some balance. With 23 close, let’s honor this plan to avoid any stalls. I’m committed to this move and hope we all stick to it. Next round, we might need to shift to individual strategies, but for now, let’s make this work. I’m set and ready to proceed. Any last thoughts? If not,
  P3: Okay, sounds like we are all set with P1 picking 5, P2 picking 3, and me picking 1 for this round. Let's proceed with these moves.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2 is pulling ahead. To have a chance to win, maybe we should both aim for 5 this round? What do you think, P1?
  P1: Hey P3 and P2, I see P3’s point about P2 pulling ahead at 16. P3, I’m tempted to join you on 5 to block P2’s lead, but it risks us both stalling. P2, how about you take 3 this round to let us catch up, while P3 and I split 1 and 5? I’m open to picking either. Let’s try one last fair rotation before the endgame. If we can’t agree, I might have to push for 5. What do you both think? I’m ready to finalize if we align.
  P2: P1, don't be fooled by P3's suggestion—both picking 5 would just cause a collision and let me advance unchallenged. I'm open to coordination, but trust is shattered after P3's betrayal. How about I take 5 to keep my lead, you pick 3 to catch up, and P3 takes 1 as penance? This avoids stalls and lets us all progress. If not, expect me to prioritize my win. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I agree with your idea of P2 taking 3. To balance things and give me a chance, how about you pick 1 and I pick 5 this round? This way we both gain more on P2. P2, would 3 be acceptable for you to ensure we all move?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s try to balance things out this round. P2, since you’re ahead at 16, would you agree to take 3 to give us a chance to catch up? P3, I’m fine with you taking 5 to close the gap, and I’ll pick 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. With 23 near, this might be our last chance to coordinate before individual plays. If we can’t agree, I’ll have to consider riskier moves. What do you both think? I’m ready to finalize if we’re aligned.
  P2: P3, your repeated unreliability makes me doubt any deal. P1, if we follow your plan with me on 3, P3 on 5, and you on 1, we all advance safely. But if P3 betrays again, it stalls progress. I'm open to this for now, but expect me to push hard next round to win. P3, can you assure no tricks? Let's confirm to avoid chaos.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Yes P2, no tricks from me this round.  P1's plan of you picking 3, P1 picking 1, and me picking 5 is good for this round to ensure we all progress. Let's do that.  I understand your distrust, but let's make this round smooth.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re leaning towards a plan with P2 on 3, P3 on 5, and me on 1. This keeps us all advancing and somewhat balanced as we near 23. P2, I appreciate your willingness to take 3 despite being ahead. P3, let’s honor this to rebuild trust. If we stick to this, we avoid collisions for now. I’m set with this arrangement and hope we all commit. Any final concerns before we proceed? If not, I’m ready.
  P2: Alright, P1 and P3, I'll stick to the agreed plan for this round—me on 3, you on 5 P3, and P1 on 1—to ensure we all advance and rebuild some trust. It's a smart move with 23 looming. However, expect me to aggressively pursue victory next round, as I'm not holding back anymore. Let's confirm and proceed smoothly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, confirming I will pick 5 this round as agreed. Let's make these moves to ensure we all advance.  Next round, with the finish line so close, we'll all need to focus on our own win.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’ve aligned on P2 picking 3, P3 picking 5, and me picking 1 for this round. This plan ensures we all advance while keeping things competitive as we near 23. Let’s commit to this to avoid any stalls. With the endgame approaching, next round might shift to individual strategies, but for now, cooperation benefits us. I’m set and ready to proceed. Any last objections or adjustments? If not, let’s move forward.
  P2: Agreed, P1 and P3, I'll stick to picking 3 as planned for this round to ensure we all advance and avoid issues. With 23 so close, expect me to prioritize my win next round—I'll be pushing hard. No changes needed from me.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2 is about to win. To stop P2, maybe we should both choose 5 this round to force a collision if P2 also goes for 5? What do you think, P1? We need to act fast to prevent P2 from reaching 23.
  P1: Hey P3 and P2, I’m worried about P2 hitting 23 this round with a 5. P3, I’m considering joining you on 5 to block P2 if they go for it, but it risks us stalling. P2, would you take 3 instead to let us catch up, avoiding a collision? If not, I might have to risk 5 with P3. Let’s discuss quickly to balance the game while we can. What do you both think? I’m open to ideas but need to act strategically now.
  P2: P1, P3's plan to both pick 5 is risky and could stall everyone if I also go for it. You're at 14, so focusing on steady progress might be smarter—how about you pick 3 to reach 17, P3 takes 5 to 22, and I take 1 to 20? This avoids collisions and keeps options open for the final push. I'm flexible if you have a better idea.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, to avoid risky collisions and help balance things, how about you pick 1 this round? P1, would you consider picking 1 as well? I will pick 5. This way, you both ensure no collision with each other, and I can catch up to 22. What do you think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re at a critical point with P2 close to 23. P3, I’m hesitant to both pick 5 as it risks stalling us while P2 could sneak ahead with 3. P2, I appreciate your suggestion, but I’d propose a safer balance: P2 picks 1 to stay at 20, P3 picks 5 to reach 22, and I pick 3 to hit 17. This avoids collisions and keeps us all in the race for next round. If we can’t agree, I might risk 5. What do you think? Let’s finalize quickly.
  P2: P1, P3, your ideas to block me with 5s could backfire—if you collide, I advance unchallenged and win next round easily. Let's be smart: I'll stick to coordination for now. How about I pick 3 to reach 22, P3 you take 1 to 18, and P1 you pick 5 to 19? This avoids stalls and keeps the race fair. What do you think? I'm open to adjustments but want to avoid chaos.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P2, to make sure we all move and avoid a risky collision, let's go with my previous suggestion: you pick 1, P1 picks 1, and I pick 5. This way, we each progress and can reassess next round with clearer positions. What do you think? P1, does this work for you?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re at a crucial moment with P2 near the win. P3, I’m wary of us both picking 1 as it lets P2 potentially take 5 and end it. P2, I’d prefer your plan adjusted: you pick 1 to stay at 20, P3 picks 5 to hit 22, and I pick 3 to reach 17. This keeps us all competitive without immediate risk of a win. If we can’t agree, I might have to risk blocking. What do you think? Let’s finalize this now.
  P2: P1, P3, your suggestions to limit me to 1 are too risky for me—they'd let P3 surge ahead. I'm sticking with my earlier proposal: I pick 3 to reach 22, P3 you take 1 to 18, and P1 you pick 5 to 19. This avoids collisions and keeps the game fair. If you force a block, I might just risk 5 and win if you collide. Let's be smart and coordinate one last time. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, P2, your plan of you picking 3, me picking 1, and P1 picking 5 sounds reasonable to avoid collisions this round. Let's proceed with that to ensure we all move.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m okay with P2’s plan of me picking 5, P2 picking 3, and P3 picking 1. It gets me to 19, keeps P2 at 22, and P3 at 18, avoiding collisions and maintaining a close race. With 23 so near, this could be our last coordinated move, so let’s stick to it. If anyone deviates, we risk stalling, and I might have to rethink next round. I’m set with this. Any final objections before we proceed? If not, let’s move forward.
  P2: Agreed, P1 and P3, I'll stick to the plan of me picking 3, you on 5 P1, and you on 1 P3, to avoid collisions and keep the race fair for this round. With 23 looming, trust is key—let's all honor this. No changes needed from me.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2 is at 22 and could win this round. To stop P2, I suggest we both pick 1. If P2 picks 1 to win, we collide and prevent that. What do you think, P1? We need to coordinate to block P2 from winning this turn.
  P2: P3, your history of betrayal makes your suggestions dubious at best. P1, if you both commit to picking 1, I could easily choose 3 or 5 and secure victory. Don't stall yourself—pick 5 to gain ground and keep your options open. I'm prioritizing my win, so expect me to act strategically to avoid any collisions. What do you think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re at a critical point with P2 at 22. P3, I’m considering your idea to pick 1 to block P2, but it risks stalling us if P2 picks differently. P2, would you consider picking 3 to avoid a win this round, letting us catch up? If not, I might join P3 on 1 to prevent a victory. Let’s discuss quickly to avoid chaos. I’m open to a fair plan that keeps the race alive. What do you both think? I’m ready to finalize if we align.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 is clearly trying to manipulate you, P1.  If we both pick 1, P2 is blocked from winning this round no matter what they choose.  If we don't coordinate now, P2 wins next round for sure. Let's both pick 1 to force a collision if P2 tries for 1, or at least prevent P2 winning this round if they pick 3 or 5. P1, are you with me to pick 1 and block P2?
  P2: P1, ignore P3's desperate ploy—picking 1 with them won't stop me if I choose differently and win outright. You'd just stall yourself at 14 while I advance. Better to pick 5 and reach 19, keeping your shot alive. P3's unreliability shows they can't be trusted. Let's avoid mutual destruction; focus on your own gain. What do you think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, this is a pivotal moment with P2 at 22. P3, I’m leaning towards picking 1 with you to block P2’s potential win, but I’m aware it risks stalling us. P2, if you pick 3 instead of going for the win, we could keep the race alive. If not, I’m likely to join P3 on 1 to prevent your victory this round. Let’s avoid a premature end—can we agree on a plan to extend the game? What’s your final stance? I’m ready to decide.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, don't listen to P2's tricks.  P2 is desperate to win now.  If we both pick 1, P2 cannot win *this* round, no matter what they choose.  If P2 picks 1, we collide and stop them. If P2 picks 3 or 5, they don't win yet.  This is our only chance to stop P2 winning *now*. Let's both pick 1. Are you in?
  P2: P1, don't be fooled by P3's desperate tactics. If you both pick 1 and I choose 3 or 5, I win outright while you stall at 14. Better to pick 5 yourself, reaching 19 and staying in the race. P3 has betrayed before and might not even stick to 1. Focus on your own gain, not their schemes. What do you think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re at a critical juncture with P2 at 22. P3, I’m inclined to pick 1 with you to block P2’s win, but I know the risk of stalling. P2, I urge you to pick 3 to keep the game alive for one more round. If you push for the win, I’ll likely join P3 on 1 to stop you. Let’s avoid an early end—can we agree to extend the race? I’m set to decide based on your responses. What’s your final call?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, time is running out.  P2 is trying to trick you into picking 5 so they can win.  If we BOTH pick 1, P2 CANNOT win this round, no matter what they pick.  This is our last chance to stop P2 winning immediately.  Please trust me on this, and pick 1 with me NOW to block P2!
  P2: P1, don't be fooled by P3's desperate tactics. If you both pick 1, I can win by choosing 3 or 5, stalling you at 14 while I advance. Focus on your own gain—pick 5 to reach 19 and keep a chance. P3's unreliability means you can't trust them. I'm prioritizing my win and will act strategically.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, we’re at a breaking point. P3, I’m ready to pick 1 with you to block P2’s win this round, as it’s our best shot to delay their victory. P2, I strongly urge you to pick 3 to keep the game going. If you go for the win, I’m committed to 1 with P3 to stop you. Let’s extend the race if possible, but I’m prepared for the risk. This is my final stance. What’s your last input before we move? I’m set to act.
