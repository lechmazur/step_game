A shared win for us is infinitely better than a stalemate that lets P2 back in the game. I am holding up my end of the bargain.\n\nP2, you are in last place. Of course you want us to collide. It's your only chance. But we won't fall for it.\n\nI am choosing 3. This guarantees I do not lose. P3, I trust you to make the same rational choice. Let's end this."}
