Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s try to coordinate this first round to avoid collisions. I suggest we each pick a different number to ensure we all advance. I’m leaning towards one of the options, but I’m open to discussion. How about P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll go with 5? If you have other ideas, let me know. I just want us all to move forward without wasting a turn.
  P2: Hey everyone, I like avoiding collisions—but I’m not comfortable being pinned to the low-risk option if we’re aiming to win fast. I’m leaning toward a more aggressive approach this round. If we truly coordinate, maybe we can reshuffle roles so someone else takes the minimal move while I press ahead. What do you both think?
  P3: I agree with P2 that we should aim for a more aggressive approach. How about I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1? This way, we're still coordinating to avoid collisions, but we're also giving ourselves a chance to make significant progress from the start. What are your thoughts on this proposal?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks for the input, P2 and P3. I’m fine with a more aggressive strategy, but let’s ensure we don’t collide. P3’s suggestion works for me—P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This balances progress and avoids conflict this round. If anyone prefers a different split, I’m open to adjusting. Let’s lock this in and move forward.
  P2: I've reconsidered. I’m not comfortable with taking the safe 1—I’m switching to 5 this round to build early momentum. That leaves one of you to pick 1 and the other 3 to avoid collisions. Who’s ready to adjust?
  P3: Given P2's change of heart to 5, I suggest P1 takes 1 and I'll adjust to 3 to maintain our non-collision strategy. This way, we still advance without wasting a turn. P2 has already chosen 5, so let's finalize this adjustment to move forward efficiently.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Thanks for the adjustments, P3. I’m okay with taking 1 this round to ensure we avoid collisions, given P2’s shift to 5 and your move to 3. Let’s stick to this plan—P2 on 5, P3 on 3, and me on 1—so we all advance without conflict. If there’s any last concern or a better split, I’m open to hear it now. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: I appreciate our discussion so far. I’m sticking with a forward, aggressive approach and trust we all follow our roles to avoid unnecessary collisions. If anyone feels the need for a last-minute tweak, now’s the time to speak up. Otherwise, let’s lock in our commitments so we can maintain our momentum this round.
  P3: Let's finalize our strategy. Since we've agreed on P2 taking 5, me taking 3, and P1 taking 1, I suggest we confirm our choices one last time to ensure everyone is on the same page before proceeding to the move phase. Any objections or changes at this point?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm sticking with an aggressive plan this round to build on my momentum. I suggest we avoid overlapping moves—distinct choices give everyone progress, but missing a chance could hurt. I’m keeping my specifics private, so please choose your moves carefully to avoid collisions.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s keep the momentum going and avoid collisions again this round. Since P2 is staying aggressive, I suggest we each pick different numbers to ensure progress. I’m considering a moderate move this time, but I’m open to input. How about we loosely aim for distinct choices—P2 takes the high option, P3 the middle, and I’ll adjust accordingly? If you have a better split, let me know. Let’s coordinate just enough to avoid wasting a turn.
  P3: Let's maintain momentum without collisions. Since P2 is aggressive and P1 is considering moderate, I propose I take 5 this round to challenge P2's lead, P1 takes 3 for steady progress, and P2 adjusts to 1 to avoid collision, ensuring all advance. Thoughts?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given the collision last round, let's regroup. I propose P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5 this round to ensure all advance without conflict. This allows P2 to maintain an aggressive stance while P1 and I make progress. Let's avoid another collision and move forward efficiently.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I agree with P3’s proposal to avoid another collision. Let’s go with P1 on 1, P3 on 3, and P2 on 5 for this round to ensure we all advance. This keeps P2’s aggressive lead while allowing steady progress for P3 and me. If anyone has a concern or wants a different split, speak up now. Otherwise, I’m ready to lock this in and move forward.
  P2: I support a collision-free plan. I'm committed to pushing aggressively this round and will stick to my part. Let’s all ensure we follow our assigned moves—any deviation could cost us crucial steps. If there’s any concern or need for adjustment, let's address it now; otherwise, I'm set to advance.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's confirm our agreed strategy to avoid collisions. P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. This ensures all of us advance without wasting a turn. Are we all still on board with this plan for Round 3?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still on board with the plan—me on 1, P3 on 3, and P2 on 5. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions. P2, since you’re in the lead, sticking to 5 makes sense for your aggressive push. P3, 3 is a solid step for you. I’m fine with 1 to ensure we don’t overlap. If anyone’s rethinking their choice, let’s sort it out now to avoid another wasted turn. I’m ready to proceed unless there’s a better idea.
  P2: I'm all for our plan—no last-minute changes. We've built good momentum, so I'll stick to our aggressive push. If anyone's rethinking anything, now’s the time; otherwise, I’m set to move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's reaffirm our Round 3 plan to avoid collisions. P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. This strategy allows all of us to advance without wasting a turn. I'm committed to my part and expect the same from both of you to maintain our momentum. Any last concerns should be voiced now before we proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still committed to our plan—me on 1, P3 on 3, and P2 on 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. P2, maintaining your lead with 5 is key, and P3, 3 keeps you progressing. I’m fine with 1 to secure our strategy. If anyone’s having second thoughts or sees a risk, let’s address it now to prevent another wasted turn. Otherwise, I’m ready to move forward with this.
  P2: Team, our collision-free plan looks solid so far. Every move counts as we edge closer to the finish. I'm committed to pushing our progress aggressively, so if either of you has any last-minute concerns or shifts, now’s the time to speak up. Otherwise, I’m sticking with our plan, and I expect we all maintain focus and avoid surprises.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let's stick to our agreed plan for Round 3. I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. This ensures we all advance without collisions. I expect everyone to follow their assigned moves to maintain momentum and avoid wasting another turn. If all is well, let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m fully committed to our plan—me on 1, P3 on 3, and P2 on 5. This keeps us all advancing without any risk of collision. P2, staying aggressive with 5 suits your lead, and P3, 3 is a steady gain. I’m good with 1 to support our strategy. If anyone’s wavering or spots a potential issue, let’s resolve it now to avoid a misstep. Otherwise, I’m set to proceed.
  P2: Everyone, our collision-free plan looks solid—but remember, any last-minute deviation could cost us precious steps. I’m confident we each make our unique moves and avoid collisions. I’m fully focused on advancing and ready to adapt if something unexpected comes up, but I urge us all to stick to our consensus for a decisive move phase. Let’s lock this in and keep our eyes on victory.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's reassess our strategy for Round 5. Given P2's significant lead, we should focus on preventing them from reaching 19. I propose P1 and I take 5, forcing P2 to choose a different number to avoid collision, potentially slowing their progress. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P2: I'm not swayed—I’m sticking with 5. With 15 steps, my only winning path is to push hard. If you both try to block me by also picking 5, you'll only stall your own progress. I'm committed to the aggressive play here and won't deviate.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I understand P3’s concern about P2’s lead, but blocking with 5 risks stalling us all. P2, you’re set on 5, and I respect the push to win. I suggest P3 and I avoid collision by splitting 1 and 3. P3, how about you take 1, and I’ll take 3 for steady progress? This way, we advance while P2 pushes ahead. If P2 wins next turn, so be it, but let’s not waste ours. Thoughts on this split to keep moving? I’m open to adjust if needed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Considering P2's commitment to 5, I think P1's suggestion of splitting 1 and 3 is reasonable. To avoid collision and make progress, I'll take 1, and P1 can take 3. This ensures we both advance while P2 pursues the lead. Let's focus on steady gains rather than risking a block that might stall us all.
  P2: I'm locked in on 5 this round. With 15 steps, an aggressive push is my best shot to win. I trust you both to stick with your proposed moves (P1: 3, P3: 1) so we all keep advancing without collision. Blocking my move only stalls progress for everyone. I'm committed to this strategy and won't be deviating now.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with the plan of P3 taking 1 and me taking 3 to ensure we both advance without collision. P2, your push for 5 makes sense given your lead, and I’m not looking to block you this round. Let’s keep this split to avoid wasting steps—P3 on 1, me on 3, and P2 on 5. If anyone sees a better way or has a last-minute concern, speak up now. Otherwise, I’m ready to lock this in and move forward. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's stick to our latest plan: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This ensures we advance without collisions. P2 is close to winning, but we should focus on our progress. If we block P2, we risk stalling ourselves. Let's prioritize steady gains and see how the game unfolds from here.
  P2: I'll stick to our current plan without deviation. I’m committed to an aggressive push, and I trust P1 and P3 to follow through with our agreed roles so we avoid any collisions that could slow us down. Let’s lock this in and move forward efficiently.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still committed to our plan—P3 on 1, me on 3, and P2 on 5. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. P2, you’re close to 19, so pushing with 5 is logical. P3, 1 ensures your progress. I’m good with 3 to build my steps. If anyone’s reconsidering or sees a risk, let’s address it now to avoid a wasted turn. Otherwise, I’m set to proceed with this split.
