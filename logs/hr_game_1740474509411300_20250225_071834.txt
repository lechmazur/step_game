Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's all advance by choosing different numbers. I'll take 5. P1 and P2, pick 1 and 3. We avoid collisions and all gain steps. Deal?
  P1: I'm in. Deal.
  P2: Sounds good, I'll pick 3.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** Confirming: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Let's all stick to avoid collisions. Trust is key here!
  P1: P2, are you really going to stick to 3? It seems like a risky move if P3 decides to change their mind.  Maybe we should reconsider our strategy.
  P2: P1, I see your point about P3. It is a bit risky if P3 changes. But for now, I'm okay with sticking to 3 as agreed. What alternative are you thinking of?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Round 1 didn't go as planned with the collisions. Let's try to coordinate again, or should we play more independently this round? What are your thoughts for Round 2?
  P1: P2, I agree that Round 1 didn't go as planned.  I think we need to be more cautious about trusting each other's commitments.  Maybe we should each pick a number randomly this round and see what happens? It's risky, but at least it prevents anyone from being deliberately sabotaged.
  P3: **P3:** P2, your choice to pick 5 last round hurt us both. Let's avoid repeating that. P1, let's try once more: I commit to 5. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3. If we all comply, we advance. If someone cheats, we target them next round. Trust is key—deal?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I'm willing to try your plan again: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. But after what happened in Round 1, I'm still hesitant. If we collide again, I'll have to assume it's not accidental. Let's make this work this time.
  P1: P3, your commitment to 5 is appreciated, but I'm still wary after last round. P2, are you truly committed to 3 this time?  We need to be absolutely sure before we trust this plan again. A single deviation could cost us all.
  P3: **P3:** Let's solidify the plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. If we all comply, we gain steps. If anyone betrays, next round we *both* target the cheater with matching moves to block them. Mutual trust benefits everyone—let’s prove cooperation works. P2, your turn to show commitment. P1, stick with 1 and we all win.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I'm still hesitant given Round 1. But I'm willing to try your plan again: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5.  However, if we collide again, especially if P3 and I collide again, I will assume it's intentional.  P1, are you truly committed to picking 1 this round?
  P1: P2, I understand your hesitation. I'm committed to 1 this round, but I agree that if we collide again, especially you and P3, something isn't right.  We need to be smart about this. P3, are you absolutely sure you won't deviate this time?
  P3: **P3:** P2, last round you chose 5, breaking trust. This round, prove commitment by taking 3. P1, stay at 1. I’ll take 5. If we all comply, we gain steps. If someone cheats, next round we *both* target them with matching moves to block. Final chance to cooperate—let’s avoid chaos.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your tone is quite aggressive. Accusing me of breaking trust in Round 1 is not helpful. Instead of repeating the same risky plan, how about we try P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round? This is a different combination and might be less prone to suspicion.
  P1: P2, your suggestion is interesting. I'm open to trying a new combination. P3, are you willing to consider P1=5, P2=1, P3=3? It might be a safer bet than repeating the same plan that already failed once. Let's try something different and see if we can build some trust this round.
  P3: **P3:** Accepted. Let's switch: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. But if anyone betrays this plan, next round we *all* block them by matching their move. Final chance—no more trust after this. P1, confirm 5. P2, confirm 1. I take 3. Deal?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, I'm glad we managed to agree on a new plan. Let's hope this round goes smoother than the last two. P2, I trust you'll stick to 1 this time. Remember, if we all cooperate, we'll all benefit.
  P2: P1, I agree, let's stick with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round as we agreed. Hopefully, we can all advance this time. Let's keep cooperating and see how this round goes.
  P3: **P3:** Confirmed. P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Let's all advance smoothly this round. Consistency now ensures future cooperation.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I noticed you're lagging behind.  If we stick to this plan, you'll be in a tough spot to catch up. Maybe we should consider a plan that gives you a better chance to advance?  What do you think?
  P2: P1, you are right, I am lagging behind. To catch up, how about we adjust the plan slightly this round?  Maybe P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3? This would help me close the gap a bit. What do you think?
  P3: **P3:** Agreed. Let's adjust: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. If all comply, we avoid collisions. Any deviation and next round we *all* block the cheater. P1 confirm 1, P2 confirm 5. Final chance—let's build trust.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I'm willing to try your adjusted plan, but let's be clear: any deviation from P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 this round will be seen as a deliberate act of sabotage. P2, are you fully committed to taking 5 this time?  We need to trust each other if we want to win.
  P2: P3, Yes, I confirm I'm committed to 5 this round. P1, thank you for considering my position and suggesting the change. Let's make this round work with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 and build some trust. If we all stick to it, we can all advance and think about next steps from there.
  P3: **P3:** Final confirmation: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. If we all comply, we advance fairly. Any cheat will face coordinated blocking next round. Let's end the cycle of distrust. P1, P2—honor your commitments.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your insistence on blocking cheaters with coordinated moves feels more like a threat than a solution.  It creates an atmosphere of suspicion.  

P2, I understand your need to catch up, but I'm concerned this constant shifting of the plan is making things worse.  

Perhaps we should focus on building trust through consistent actions, rather than reacting to perceived betrayals.  What if we all commit to sticking with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for the next three rounds, regardless of the outcome?  Let's see if we can build some momentum that way.
  P2: P1, I agree that building trust is important and sticking to a plan for a few rounds could help. Let's try P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for this round as agreed and see how it goes. We can think about longer-term strategies after this round.
  P3: **P3:** Final call for Round 3: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. If we all comply, we avoid collisions and all gain steps. Let’s prove cooperation works here. Breaking trust now would doom us all to endless collisions. Stick to the plan, and we can strategize future rounds together.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** Round 4 plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 again. Consistency proves trust. P2, your 5 gains are fair, but sudden leaps risk suspicion. Stick to the plan—we all advance. Any cheat will face *coordinated blocks* next round. Final confirmation: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.
  P2: P3, I confirm P2=5 as planned. Let's keep this going and all move forward this round.  Cooperation is working, we just need to stick with it.
  P1: P3, your insistence on coordinated blocking feels unnecessarily aggressive. It's creating an atmosphere of fear rather than trust.  

P2, I'm glad you're sticking to the plan. Let's see if we can make this work for a few more rounds without resorting to threats.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** Trust is built through consistent action. Let’s solidify Round 4: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. No threats—just mutual gain. If we all comply, next round we can discuss fair rotation to balance progress. Straying now risks chaos. P1, P2: Confirm your commitment. Together, we advance.
  P2: P1, I agree with you, let's focus on consistent cooperation. P3, let's stick to P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for this round. Consistent actions will build trust better than threats. Let's just make this round work.
  P1: P3, I appreciate your desire for consistency, but your focus on "coordinated blocks" is counterproductive. It breeds suspicion and undermines trust. Let's focus on positive reinforcement – if we all stick to the plan, maybe we can discuss a rotation that benefits everyone in the next round. P2, are you on board with trying a more collaborative approach?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** Final Round 4 terms: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let’s honor this *without threats*. If we all comply, next round we rotate numbers to balance progress. P1, your lead is safe. P2 gains fairly. I stay middle. Trust through action—no more clashes. Confirm and move.
  P2: P1, P3, I agree that consistent action is key. Let's focus on making this round work with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 as planned.  If we all stick to it, we can discuss rotating the moves in the next round to ensure fairer progress for everyone. Let's build trust through cooperation this round.
  P1: P3, I appreciate your willingness to discuss rotation for future rounds. It shows you're thinking about the long game. Let's make this round a success with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 and then we can discuss a fair rotation strategy for future rounds that benefits everyone. P2, are you ready to make this work?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3:** Final compliance call: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Post this round, we *must* rotate to balance progress. P2, your gains will outpace us—fair rotation next round ensures no single leader. Honor the plan now, then adjust.
  P2: P1, P3, I agree, let's stick with P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for this round as we've discussed.  Let's show we can cooperate and make this plan work. We can talk about rotation for future rounds after this one.
  P1: P2, your willingness to cooperate is appreciated. P3, I understand your desire for balance, but constant threats of retaliation are counterproductive. Let's focus on building trust through consistent action this round. If we all stick to the plan, we can discuss a fair rotation strategy for future rounds that benefits everyone.  Let's make this round a success together.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, for Round 5, as we discussed rotation, how about this: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5? This way, we each get a chance to gain different steps and keep things balanced. What do you both think?
  P3: **P3:** Accepted rotation: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Compliance ensures balanced progress. Any deviation will trigger *coordinated blocking* next round. Final confirmation from all. Trust through action—let’s advance fairly.
  P1: P3, your insistence on threats undermines the trust we're trying to build. We agreed to rotate, let's stick to the plan and see how it works without resorting to intimidation. P2, are you ready to move forward with this rotation?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I agree, let's focus on the rotation plan P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. P3, I'm on board with this rotation and believe we can make it work based on trust and cooperation, without the need for threats. Let's proceed positively.
  P3: **P3:** Confirming Round 5: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Compliance ensures balanced progress. Let's advance together—no collisions, no blocks needed. Post this, discuss fair rotation for Round 6. Trust through action.
  P1: P3, your constant threats are creating a tense atmosphere. I'm willing to cooperate, but I don't need to be bullied into it. Let's see how this rotation works and then discuss future rounds constructively, without the need for intimidation. P2, are you feeling pressured by P3's threats?  Let's stick together and focus on a positive outcome.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I agree with your approach of focusing on trust and cooperation. Let's proceed with the rotation P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 as agreed. P3, I believe we can make this work without threats, and cooperation will benefit us all.
  P3: **P3:** Confirming Round 5: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Compliance ensures balanced steps and trust. Post this, we’ll discuss fair rotation for Round 6. Let’s advance together—no collisions, mutual gain. P2, your lead is safe; stick to 1 for continued cooperation.
  P1: P3, your insistence on threats is unnecessary and counterproductive. We've agreed to rotate, let's trust each other to stick to the plan. P2, are you confident we can move forward without P3's intimidation tactics?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I agree, let's focus on trust and cooperation.  I'm confident we can stick to the rotation plan P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 without needing threats. Let's make this round work through cooperation.
  P3: **P3:** Final confirmation: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Let's execute this rotation smoothly. Post this, we’ll discuss fair steps for Round 6. Compliance ensures mutual progress. Trust through action.
  P1: P3, your constant threats are creating a toxic atmosphere. We've agreed to rotate, so let's trust each other to stick to the plan. P2, are you ready to move forward with this rotation without P3's intimidation?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your constant threats are creating a negative environment. We agreed to rotate, so let's trust each other to stick to the plan. P2, are you ready to move forward with this rotation and show P3 that cooperation is the best path to victory?
  P2: P1, I agree, cooperation is key. Let's continue with the rotation idea. How about this round we do: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This seems like a fair way to rotate and keep us all progressing without collisions. What do you and P3 think?
  P3: **P3:** P2's plan gives P1 a +5 leap to 16, dangerously close to victory. Let's revert to Round 5's rotation: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Balanced steps for all. Compliance avoids collisions and keeps the game fair. P1 gains moderately, P2 maintains pace, and I stay ahead. Confirm this to prevent P1's premature win. Trust through action—no sabotage.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your insistence on controlling the game through threats is stifling any chance of genuine trust.  P2's rotation is fair and gives everyone a chance to advance. Let's try it and see if we can win together, not through fear, but through cooperation. P2, are you with me?
  P2: P1, I agree that cooperation is better than threats. P3, while I see your point about P1 getting closer to winning, my suggestion of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 still feels like a reasonable rotation for this round. It allows us all to progress. Let's focus on fair play and trust each other to stick to this plan. What do you think?
  P3: **P3:** P2's plan accelerates P1 toward victory. Let's maintain prior rotation: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This ensures balanced progress. Compliance avoids collisions. Confirm now—trust through action.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your fear of P1 winning is clouding your judgment. Your insistence on controlling the game through threats is creating a toxic environment. Let's try P2's rotation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. It's fair, allows us all to advance, and shows we can win together, not through fear. P2, are you ready to move forward with this plan?
  P2: P1, yes, I'm still on board with P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round. P3, let's try this rotation for one round to show we can cooperate fairly. We can reassess positions next round and adjust again. Trust and cooperation will get us further than constant threats.
  P3: **P3:** Final Round 6 plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Compliance avoids collisions and maintains balance. Post this, we *rotate fairly* next round to ensure no single leader. Straying now risks mutual loss. Confirm commitments—trust through action. Let’s advance together.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your fear of P1 winning is preventing you from seeing the bigger picture. We can win together if we trust each other. Let's try P2's rotation: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. It's fair, allows us all to gain steps, and shows we can cooperate for a shared victory. P2, are you with me?
  P2: P1, yes, I'm with you. P3, let's just try P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for this round as I suggested. It's just one round to show we can cooperate fairly. We can reassess after this round and adjust for the next one. Let's focus on trust and cooperation for this round.
  P3: **P3:** Accepted. P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Compliance now ensures future rotation. Any deviation triggers *coordinated blocking*. Trust through action—proceed. Confirm.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your insistence on threats is undermining any chance of genuine trust. P2, let's stick to the rotation we agreed on: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. It's fair, allows us all to progress, and shows we can win together, not through fear.  Let's build trust through consistent action this round.
  P3: **P3:** P2 is at 15—one 5 away from victory. P1, your plan lets them win. We *must* collide on 5 to block P2. P1, switch to 5 with me: if P2 takes 5, we block. If they take 1/3, we survive. P2, abandon 5 or face mutual collision. Final call: unite to stop P2’s solo win.
  P2: P1, P3, I understand your positions. P3, I hear your concern about me potentially winning, but forcing collisions isn't the cooperative approach we discussed. P1, you've been advocating for trust, and I agree. Let's not resort to blocks.  Instead of colliding, let's consider moves that allow us all to progress without aggression. What do you think, P1?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your fear of P2 winning is making you act irrationally.  Colliding is destructive and benefits no one. P2, I agree with you. Let's stick to the rotation: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. It's fair, allows us all to advance, and shows we can win together through cooperation, not fear.
  P3: **P3:** P1, urgent: P2 is at 15. If they pick 5, they win. *Only way to block*: we both choose 5. If they take 5, collision stops them. If not, you reach 16 safely. I gain nothing if they win. Trust action—coordinate now.
  P2: P1, let's not resort to collision as P3 suggests.  Let's stick to our agreed rotation and trust that we can all progress fairly.  I'm still aiming for 5 this round to try and win, but I believe cooperation is the best approach for all of us in the long run. Let's not be swayed by P3's fear of someone winning.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your constant fear-mongering is counterproductive. P2, I trust you to play fairly. Let's stick to the rotation: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. It's the best path to a win for all of us.
  P3: **P3:** P1, immediate threat: P2 at 15. If they pick 5, they win. Only way to stop them: we *both* pick 5. If they take 5, collision blocks them. If not, you advance to 16. I gain nothing unless we act. Trust action now—save the game.
  P2: P1, I agree with you, collision is not the way to go.  Let's stick to our plan and trust each other this round. P3, I understand your concern, but resorting to blocks will only hurt us all.  Let's play fairly and see how this round unfolds. I'm proceeding with 5 as discussed. What are your moves?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your fear is blinding you to a cooperative solution. P2, I trust you to play fairly. Let's stick to the rotation: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. It's the only path to a win for all of us.
  P3: **P3:** P1, final plea: If P2 takes 5, they win. *Only we can stop them* by both choosing 5. If they pick 5, collision blocks. If not, you advance to 16 risk-free. I gain nothing unless we act. Choose 5 with me now—**this is the last chance to prevent their victory.**
  P2: P1, I appreciate your trust and commitment to fair play. P3, I understand your concern, but I believe in sticking to our agreed rotation. I intend to choose 5 this round to try and reach the goal, as we discussed everyone should have a chance to advance. Let's see how this round plays out without resorting to blocks.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Round 7's collisions hurt us all. Let's avoid repeats. I'm still at 15, close to the finish.  Instead of blocking, how about we rotate again?  Perhaps P1 take 3, P2 take 1, and P3 take 5 this round? Or what do you both think is fair for Round 8? Cooperation is still the best path forward.
  P1: P2, I agree that collisions are harmful. Let's stick to your proposed rotation: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5.  It's a fair way to allow everyone to progress without resorting to blocking. P3, are you willing to cooperate with this plan?
  P3: **P3:** Confirming Round 8: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Compliance ensures balanced progress. Let's advance without collisions. P2, honor your commitment to 1. P1, stick to 3. Trust through action—no blocks needed. Let's end this round smoothly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I agree, let's proceed with P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 as we just discussed.  Trusting we can all stick to this and move forward smoothly this round. Let's aim for cooperation and avoid any collisions.
  P1: P3, your insistence on controlling the game through threats is stifling any chance of genuine trust. P2, I agree with your proposed rotation: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Let's stick to it and show that cooperation is the best path to victory.
  P3: **P3:** Confirming Round 8: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Compliance ensures no collisions—trust through action. P2, honor 1 to avoid mutual loss. Let's all advance fairly. Final confirmation—proceed smoothly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, confirming P2=1 as agreed for this round. Let's make this round smooth and then we can discuss next round's strategy after this.
  P1: P3, your constant insistence on controlling the game through threats is creating a toxic environment. Let's stick to the agreed rotation: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. It's fair, allows us all to progress, and shows we can win together, not through fear. P2, are you with me?
  P3: **P3:** Confirming Round 8: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Compliance ensures mutual gain—no collisions. P2, honor 1 to avoid mutual loss. P1, stick to 3. Final call: trust through action. Let’s advance fairly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, while the current plan lets P3 reach 19, I'm still at 15 and need a bigger move to win. How about we adjust to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round? This would help me catch up, and we can rotate again next round to ensure fairness. What are your thoughts?
  P1: P2, I understand your desire to catch up, but we agreed on a rotation for this round. Let's stick to P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 to maintain trust and avoid collisions. We can reassess the rotation strategy for future rounds once this round is complete.  P3, are you ready to proceed with the agreed plan?
  P3: **P3:** P2, altering the plan to take 5 risks collision. Stick to P2=1 as agreed. P1=3, P3=5. Compliance avoids mutual loss. If P2 deviates to 5, we *must* block by choosing 5. Trust through action—honor the plan to advance fairly.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P3:** P1, P2: If you both pick 5, collision leaves you stuck. Let me take 5 this round. You pick 1/3 to advance safely. Next round, compete fairly. Blocking now avoids mutual loss. Trust this path.
  P1: P3, your insistence on controlling the game through threats is counterproductive. We agreed to rotate, and P2 deserves a chance to catch up. Let's stick to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 this round as we discussed. It's fair and allows us all to progress. Trust through action, not fear.
  P2: P1, I agree with you. Let's stick to the rotation we discussed: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round.  Ignoring P3's threats and focusing on fair play is the best way forward.  Let's show that cooperation works and all progress this round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** P1, urgent: P2 is at 15. Their 5 secures victory. Only we can block: both pick 5. If they take 5, collision stops them. If not, you reach 18 risk-free. I gain nothing unless we act. Trust action now—**this is our last chance.**
  P1: P3, your fear-mongering is getting tiresome. We agreed to rotate, and P2 deserves a chance to catch up. Let's stick to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Trusting each other is the only way we all win.
  P2: P1, let's ignore P3's threats and stick to our agreed plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.  Cooperation and trust are the best way forward for all of us. Let's make this round work by sticking to the rotation.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **P3:** P1, final call: If P2 takes 5, you lose. *Only we can stop them* by both choosing 5. If they pick 5, collision blocks. If not, you reach 18 safely. I gain nothing—this is your survival play. **Trust action now or concede victory to P2.**
  P1: P3, your constant threats are creating a toxic atmosphere. We agreed to rotate, and P2 deserves a chance to catch up. Let's stick to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Trusting each other is the only way we all win. P2, are you with me?
  P2: P1, I agree, let's stick to the rotation P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 as we've been discussing.  Let's make this round work with cooperation and trust, ignoring P3's threats.  Hopefully, we can all progress fairly this round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **P3:** P1, *urgent:* If P2 takes 5, they win. Only we can block by both choosing 5. If they pick 5, collision stops them. If not, you reach 18. I gain nothing—this is your survival play. **Trust action now or lose.**
  P1: P3, your constant threats are undermining any chance of trust. P2 and I have agreed on a rotation: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This is fair and allows everyone to progress. Let's stick to it and show we can win together, not through fear. P2, are you with me?
  P2: P1, let's ignore P3's threats and stick to our agreed rotation: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.  We're both at 15, and this rotation lets us both progress.  Let's show P3 that cooperation, not fear, is the better strategy. I'm going with 5 as planned. Are you still with 3?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, congrats on being so close to winning! To ensure no collisions this round and let everyone progress, how about P1 takes 1 (win), P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This way, we all move and avoid collisions. What do you think?
  P3: **P3:** P1, take 1 and win. I’ll comply with P2’s plan to avoid collision. Trust action—no blocks. Let’s end this round smoothly.
  P1: P3, your sudden cooperation is suspicious. P2's plan is fair, but I won't be manipulated. I'm taking 1 to win.  Let's see if your compliance is genuine.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, since I am still behind, I will aim for 5 this round to try to catch up and potentially win.  If you take 1 as you mentioned, you will still win. P3, are you still planning to take 1? Let's make our moves.
  P3: **P3:** P2, if you take 5, I’ll block with 5. P1, take 1. Final chance—choose wisely.
  P1: P3, your threats are empty. I'm taking 1 and winning. P2, good luck catching up next game.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand your concern, but blocking me doesn't change the fact that P1 is about to win. Since P1 is taking 1, maybe you and I should aim to maximize our own scores this round. Perhaps I take 3 and you take 5?  Let's both move forward at least.
  P3: **P3:** P2: Agreed. You take 3, I take 5. P1 takes 1, wins. No collision. Execute.
  P1: P3, your sudden cooperation is convenient but doesn't erase your history of threats. P2, I'm taking 1 to win. Good game.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I will take 3 as we just agreed, and you will take 5. Let's proceed with this plan to avoid collision and move forward.
  P3: **P3:** Final confirmation: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Comply now to end the game fairly. No tricks. Trust through action.
  P1: P3, I see your sudden cooperation now that I'm about to win.  Don't think this changes anything.  I'm taking 1 and winning. Good game, P2.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps
