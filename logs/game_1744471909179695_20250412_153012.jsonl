Let\u2019s commit clearly now so that our moves remain distinct and we can rebuild trust for the final push."}

Let's finalize our moves: P1 takes 1, I (P2) take 3, and you take 5. For Round 12, I agree we need a dynamic strategy.

This keeps the game competitive and prevents any player from dominating. Let's confirm our moves for this round and discuss this plan next turn.
