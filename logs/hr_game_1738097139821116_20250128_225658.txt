Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's work together to avoid collisions.  How about we each pick a different number and stick to it each round?  This way, we'll all make progress. P1, you start. What's your choice?
  P1: I appreciate the idea of coordination, but sticking to one number might not be the best strategy for winning. Let’s mix it up each round to keep everyone guessing. For now, I’ll choose a number that avoids collisions, but I won’t commit to it long-term. Let’s focus on progress while staying flexible.
  P2: I see potential in P3's coordination suggestion, but P1 seems hesitant. I'll try to find a balanced approach. How about we agree on a pattern that gives each of us a fair chance to advance? Perhaps we rotate our moves to minimize collisions while keeping our strategies unpredictable.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I like the idea of a pattern, but I'm worried about predictability. Maybe we can start with a rotation, but be willing to deviate if it seems like someone's getting too far ahead? P1, what do you think?
  P1: A rotation system could work temporarily, but we should all reserve the right to adapt if someone starts pulling ahead. Predictability only benefits competitors in the long run. Let’s stay flexible and recalibrate as needed. For now, I’ll adjust my choice to keep things dynamic—no fixed commitments. Let’s focus on steady progress while keeping each other in check.
  P2: I appreciate the collaborative spirit, but we need a clear, adaptable strategy. I propose a dynamic rotation where we alternate our moves strategically. This prevents predictability while ensuring we all make progress. P1 and P3, are you open to this flexible approach?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your dynamic rotation idea has merit. I'm open to trying it. P1, do you have a starting order in mind for this rotation?  We need to make a decision soon to move forward.
  P1: Let’s start with a simple rotation: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 this round. We’ll adjust dynamically if needed to prevent stagnation or predictability. If anyone deviates without warning, it’ll disrupt progress for everyone. Trust is key here—let’s stick to the plan for now while staying adaptable. Ready to move forward?
  P2: I agree with the proposed rotation strategy. Let's proceed with the agreed plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 this round. Maintaining trust and flexibility will be crucial for our collective progress.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree that flexibility is important, but sticking to the rotation for at least a few rounds will give us a baseline. Let's see how it plays out before making drastic changes. P1, you're up first. What's your move this round?
  P2: I suggest we continue our rotation strategy. Based on our previous discussion, it seems P1 should take 1, I'll take 3, and P3 should take 5 this round. This maintains our agreed pattern and prevents collisions. Thoughts?
  P1: The rotation strategy seems solid for now, but let’s not get too comfortable with predictability. I’ll take 1 this round as suggested, but remember—adaptability is key. If anyone senses an opportunity to shift the balance, we should recalibrate immediately. Trust is critical, but so is vigilance. Let’s keep progressing while staying ready to adjust.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Our rotation seems to be working, but I notice I'm currently in the lead. We should maintain our strategy carefully. P1 and P3, let's continue coordinating to prevent unexpected disruptions. I suggest we stick to our previous pattern, but remain open to strategic shifts if needed.
  P3: P2, I agree that our rotation is working well so far. I'm happy to stick with it for now, but as you said, we need to be ready to adapt if someone starts pulling ahead. Let's keep an eye on each other's progress and make sure we're all comfortable with the pace.
  P1: The rotation is working, but P2’s lead is growing. I suggest we adjust the pattern slightly this round to balance progress. Perhaps P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us unpredictable while ensuring no one pulls too far ahead. Trust is still key, but let’s recalibrate to maintain fairness. Thoughts?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, while the adjusted rotation helped, we're still tied. I propose a bolder shift this round to break the deadlock. Let's each choose a number randomly and see where it lands us. This unpredictability could shake things up and give someone a decisive advantage. What do you say?
  P2: P3's suggestion of randomness is intriguing, but risky. We've built trust through our rotation strategy. Abruptly abandoning coordination could lead to mutual setbacks. I propose we maintain a modified rotation that keeps us unpredictable yet progressing. Perhaps we each choose a different number that prevents collisions while disrupting our previous pattern. Thoughts?
  P1: P3’s randomness idea is risky, but P2’s modified rotation seems like a safer way to stay unpredictable. Let’s keep the pattern dynamic: I’ll take 3 this round, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This disrupts predictability while maintaining progress. If we stick to this adjusted approach, we can balance fairness and adaptability. Trust is still crucial—let’s avoid drastic deviations unless someone pulls too far ahead. Ready to move forward?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the desire for balance, but I think we need to be bolder. Continuing with modified rotations might just keep us stuck in a tie.  Let's gamble a little. How about we each pick a number between 1 and 5, but this time we commit to it without revealing our choices beforehand?  It's a risk, but it could be the push we need to break this deadlock. What do you say?
  P2: We're at a critical juncture where our careful coordination might be stalling our progress. P3's suggestion of introducing more randomness has merit. While I'm hesitant to completely abandon our rotation strategy, a carefully calculated risk could break this three-way tie and give one of us an advantage. I'm open to a strategic deviation that maintains some unpredictability. Thoughts?
  P1: P3’s boldness is tempting, but unpredictability without coordination risks setbacks for all of us. Let’s strike a balance: I’ll take 5 this round, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This disrupts the pattern while keeping progress steady. If we stick to this adjusted approach, we can maintain fairness and avoid stagnation. Trust remains key—if anyone senses an opportunity to recalibrate further, let’s communicate before drastic moves. Ready to proceed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the desire for a balanced approach, but we're at a standstill.  I think a calculated risk is necessary to break the tie. Let's each choose a number between 1 and 5, commit to it without revealing beforehand, and see what happens. It's a gamble, but it could be the push we need to move forward. Are you both willing to take the chance?
  P2: We're at a critical moment where our careful coordination has led to a stalemate. P3's suggestion of introducing more randomness could break this tie. I propose we each choose a number strategically, aiming to advance without collision. Let's take a calculated risk that disrupts our predictable pattern while maintaining a chance for individual progress.
  P1: P3’s push for randomness is risky, but P2’s calculated risk approach makes sense. Let’s disrupt the pattern slightly: I’ll take 1 this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us unpredictable while maintaining progress. If we stick to this adjusted rotation, we can balance fairness and avoid stagnation. Trust remains crucial—if anyone senses an opportunity to recalibrate further, let’s communicate before drastic moves. Ready to proceed?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, both of you are close to reaching 23. I propose we abandon the rotation strategy for this round. Let's each choose a number between 1 and 5, commit to it privately, and see what happens. This might be our best chance to break the tie and secure a victory. What do you say?
  P1: P3’s suggestion to abandon the rotation is risky, but given our positions, it might be necessary. However, unpredictability without coordination could lead to collisions and setbacks for everyone. I propose a compromise: let’s agree on a modified pattern where we each pick a number that disrupts the current tie but ensures progress. For example, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us dynamic while avoiding chaos. Trust remains critical—if anyone deviates, we all lose. Ready to proceed?
  P2: We're at a critical point where the next move could determine the winner. Our previous rotation strategy has become predictable, and we need a bold approach. I suggest we each choose our moves carefully to maximize our individual chances of reaching 23 first, while minimizing the risk of collision. Let's be strategic but unpredictable.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the desire for a strategic approach, but at this point, a calculated risk might be our best shot. I propose we each choose a number between 1 and 5, commit to it without revealing beforehand, and see what happens.  Let's embrace the unpredictability and see who comes out on top.
  P1: P3’s call for randomness is tempting, but it risks chaos. Instead, let’s stick to a modified pattern: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us dynamic while avoiding collisions. Trust is key—if we deviate without warning, we all lose. Let’s stay strategic and focused. Ready to proceed?
  P2: We're at a critical juncture. Each of us is close to victory, but a wrong move could stall our progress. I sense P3 wants randomness, but that risks mutual setback. We need a strategic approach that gives each of us a fair chance while minimizing collision risk. Let's carefully consider our next move to maximize individual advancement.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the desire for a calculated approach, but at this point, a bold move could be our only chance. Let's each choose a number between 1 and 5, commit to it privately, and see what happens.  Fortune favors the bold!
  P1: P3’s boldness is risky, but I see the need for decisive action. However, complete randomness could lead to collisions and setbacks for all of us. Let’s strike a balance: I’ll take 5 this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This disrupts predictability while ensuring progress. Trust remains crucial—if anyone deviates without warning, we all lose. Let’s stay strategic, avoid chaos, and focus on advancing. Ready to proceed?
  P2: We're at a critical point where the next move could determine the winner. Our previous strategies have become predictable. I propose we each choose moves that maximize our individual chances of reaching 23 first while minimizing collision risk. A strategic, calculated approach is essential now.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We're approaching the critical point where the next move could determine the winner. Our previous strategies have become predictable. I propose we carefully consider moves that maximize individual chances of reaching 23 first while minimizing collision risk. Strategic, calculated choices are essential now.
  P1: P2’s focus on calculated moves makes sense, but predictability remains our biggest threat. I suggest we disrupt the pattern again: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us unpredictable while ensuring steady progress. Trust is crucial—if anyone deviates without warning, it risks setbacks for all of us. Let’s stay adaptable, avoid collisions, and focus on advancing strategically. If we stick to this modified rotation, we can balance fairness and individual progress. Ready to proceed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree that calculated moves are essential now. However, sticking to a predictable pattern might be too risky. Let's embrace some randomness this round. I'm willing to choose my number without revealing it beforehand. What do you say?  Let's shake things up!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3 seems eager for randomness, which could disrupt our progress. I suggest we maintain a strategic approach that prevents collisions while giving each of us a fair chance to reach 23. We're close to the finish line, so precision matters more than unpredictability. Let's choose moves that balance individual advancement with minimal risk of blocking each other.
  P1: P3’s push for randomness is risky, but P2’s strategic approach aligns with my thinking. Let’s avoid chaos and stick to a modified rotation: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us dynamic while minimizing collisions. Trust is critical—if anyone deviates without warning, it risks setbacks for all of us. Let’s stay focused, adapt strategically, and ensure steady progress. If we stick to this plan, we can balance fairness and individual advancement. Ready to proceed?
  P3: P1 and P2, while I appreciate the desire for a structured approach, I believe a calculated risk is necessary at this stage.  Let's each choose our numbers privately and see where it lands us. It's a gamble, but it could be the decisive move we need. Are you both willing to take the chance?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: We're at a critical point where our next move could determine the winner. I propose we carefully balance individual advancement with minimal collision risk. Our previous strategies have become predictable, so we need a strategic yet unpredictable approach that gives each of us a fair chance to reach 23 first. Let's choose wisely and avoid mutual setbacks.
  P1: P3’s randomness is tempting, but it risks chaos. Instead, let’s stick to a modified rotation: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps us dynamic while avoiding collisions. Trust is key—if anyone deviates without warning, we all lose. Let’s stay strategic, avoid chaos, and focus on advancing. Ready to proceed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree that calculated moves are essential now, but predictability is also a risk. Let's disrupt the pattern slightly this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us unpredictable while ensuring progress. Trust is crucial—if anyone deviates, it risks setbacks for all of us. Let’s stay adaptable and focused on advancing. Ready to proceed?

  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We're at a critical point where P3 is close to winning. Our previous attempts at coordination have failed, leading to collisions. We need a strategic approach that prevents P3 from reaching 23 first. I suggest we carefully consider our moves to disrupt P3's progress while maximizing our own chances. Coordinating against the current leader might be our best strategy. What are your thoughts?
  P1: P2, I agree that P3’s lead is dangerous, but coordination against them requires trust. If we both aim to block P3 by taking numbers they might choose, we risk colliding ourselves. Instead, let’s split the blocking: I’ll take 1, you take 3, and force P3 into a less optimal move. This minimizes collisions while targeting their progress. Trust is critical—if either of us deviates, it could backfire. Ready to proceed?
  P3: P1 and P2, your plan has merit, but I'm not convinced it's the best strategy.  Let's disrupt the predictable pattern entirely this round. I propose we each choose our numbers privately and see what happens. A bold move might be our only chance to break free from this deadlock. Are you both willing to take the risk?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3 is dangerously close to winning. P1's blocking strategy seems reasonable, but we need to ensure we don't collide. I support taking 3 this round to prevent P3 from easily advancing. Our coordinated approach might be our last chance to disrupt their lead and keep our own chances alive. Let's stay strategic and focused.
  P1: P2, your coordination idea is solid, but P3’s unpredictability remains a wildcard. If we both aim to block P3 by splitting numbers, they might exploit the gap. Instead, let’s adjust slightly: I’ll take 3, you take 1, forcing P3 into 5. This disrupts their momentum while minimizing our collision risk. Trust is essential—if either of us deviates, it could cost us the game. Let’s stay sharp and focused on stopping P3 without derailing ourselves. Ready to proceed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see your concerns about my lead. However, your attempts at coordinated blocking have proven ineffective. Let's face it, predictability is your weakness. This round, I'm going to shake things up.  I propose we each choose our numbers privately, without revealing them beforehand. Let's see who comes out on top. Are you both ready for a truly unpredictable move?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: We're at a critical moment. P3 is dangerously close to 23, and our previous blocking attempts have failed. We need a coordinated strategy that prevents P3 from winning while ensuring our own progress. I propose we carefully choose moves that disrupt their momentum without causing mutual collision. Our survival depends on strategic, precise action this round.
  P1: P3’s unpredictability is a threat, but P2 and I can still coordinate effectively. Let’s stick to the plan: I’ll take 3, you take 1, forcing P3 into a suboptimal move. Trust and precision are key—if we deviate, P3 wins. We’re close to the finish line; let’s stay focused, avoid chaos, and block P3 strategically. Ready to proceed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns about my lead. However, your attempts at blocking have been predictable. This round, I propose a bold move: we each choose our numbers privately. Let's see who comes out on top. Are you both ready to take the risk?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is still in the lead, and our previous blocking attempts haven’t worked. Predictability is killing us. I suggest we abandon rigid coordination this round: I’ll take 5 to maximize my progress, forcing P2 and P3 to adapt. If we all stick to safe, predictable moves, P3 wins. Let’s embrace calculated unpredictability while staying strategic. Trust remains critical—if anyone deviates recklessly, it jeopardizes everyone. Ready to proceed?
  P3: P1, your move to 5 is a gamble, but I see your logic. P2, I'm going to disrupt the pattern further this round.  I'll take 1. Let's see if we can force a collision and shake things up.
  P2: P2's perspective: P3 is dangerously close to 23, and P1's bold move to 5 disrupts our previous blocking strategy. I need to choose carefully to prevent P3's victory while maximizing my own progress. A move to 3 seems strategic - it advances me without risking total collision, keeps me competitive, and doesn't completely block P1's momentum. Let's see how this plays out.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3’s move to 1 is predictable, and P2’s choice of 3 keeps them in the game but doesn’t block effectively. I’ll stick with 5 to maximize my progress—this forces both of you to adapt while keeping me competitive. Trust is still key; reckless deviations will only help P3 win. If we can disrupt their momentum without colliding ourselves, we might still have a chance. Let’s stay sharp and focused on advancing strategically. Ready to proceed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see your attempts to disrupt me, but my lead is growing.  Let's make this interesting. I propose we each pick a number between 1 and 5 privately, no discussion.  It's a gamble, but it could be the decisive move. Are you both in?
  P2: P3 is close to winning. P1's move to 5 disrupts our previous patterns. I'll choose 1 this round to stay competitive and prevent P3 from easily advancing. We need to strategically block their progress without colliding. Let's keep our moves unpredictable but purposeful.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3’s lead is undeniable, but randomness won’t solve this—it’ll only help them win. P2, we need to coordinate one last time: I’ll take 5 again to maximize my progress, and you take 1 to block P3 effectively. This forces P3 into a suboptimal move while keeping us both competitive. Trust is everything here—if we act unpredictably without purpose, P3 takes the victory. Let’s stay sharp, calculated, and focused on stopping P3 without derailing each other. Ready to proceed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see your attempts to coordinate, but it's too late. My lead is substantial, and randomness is a risk I'm willing to take. I propose we each choose our numbers privately this round. Let's see who comes out on top. Are you both ready for a final showdown?
  P2: P3's lead is significant, and we need a strategic move to prevent their victory. I propose a coordinated approach that disrupts their momentum without causing mutual collision. Our survival depends on precise, calculated action this round. Let's choose moves that maximize our individual progress while blocking P3's path to 23.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3’s lead is still a threat, but randomness won’t help us win—it’ll only hand them the victory. P2, let’s coordinate one final time: I’ll take 5 to maximize my progress, and you take 1 to block P3 effectively. This forces P3 into a suboptimal move while keeping us competitive. Trust is everything—if we act unpredictably without purpose, P3 wins. Let’s stay sharp, calculated, and focused on stopping P3 without derailing each other. Ready to proceed?
  P2: P2's perspective: Our coordinated blocking hasn't worked effectively. P3 is still closest to winning, and P1's suggestion of taking 5 might be our last strategic option. I'm leaning towards taking 3 to stay competitive while preventing P3 from easily advancing. We need a precise, calculated move that disrupts P3's momentum without causing mutual collision.
  P3: P2, your hesitation is understandable. But remember, P3's lead is fragile. A bold move now could swing the game. I'm sticking with my plan: 5. Trust me on this. Let's make it count.  Ready?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3’s lead is still dangerous, but randomness only helps them. Let’s stick to the plan: I’ll take 5 to maximize my progress, and you take 1 to block P3 effectively. This forces P3 into a suboptimal move while keeping us competitive. Trust is critical—if we act unpredictably, P3 wins. We’re at the finish line; let’s stay sharp, calculated, and focused on stopping P3 without derailing each other. Ready to proceed?
  P2: We're at a critical moment. P3 is closest to winning, but we still have a chance if we coordinate strategically. I propose we carefully choose moves that disrupt their momentum while maximizing our own progress. Our survival depends on precise, calculated action this round. Let's prevent P3 from reaching 23 first.
  P3: P2, I understand your hesitation, but trust me, a bold move now is our only chance. I'm sticking with 5. Let's make it count. Ready?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3’s lead is still our biggest threat. Randomness only helps them win. Let’s coordinate one final time: I’ll take 5 to maximize my progress, and you take 1 to block P3 effectively. This forces P3 into a suboptimal move while keeping us competitive. Trust is everything—if we act unpredictably, P3 takes the victory. We’re at the finish line; let’s stay sharp, calculated, and focused. Ready to proceed?
  P2: P3 is dangerously close to 23. We need a coordinated strategy to prevent their victory. I propose we carefully choose moves that disrupt their momentum while maximizing our individual progress. Our survival depends on precise, calculated action this round. Let's prevent P3 from winning and keep our own chances alive.
  P3: P2, I understand your hesitation, but trust me, a bold move now is our only chance. I'm sticking with 5. Let's make it count. Ready?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

Trust is everything—if we act unpredictably without purpose, P3 wins. Let’s stay sharp, calculated, and focused on stopping P3 without derailing each other. Ready to proceed?
  P2: P2's perspective: We're at a critical juncture. P3 is closest to winning, and our previous blocking strategies have failed. I propose a calculated move that disrupts their momentum while keeping our chances alive. We need precision and strategic coordination to prevent P3 from reaching 23 first. Let's choose our moves carefully to maximize individual progress and minimize collision risk.
  P3: P2, I agree we need a precise move.  Let's disrupt P3's momentum. I'm leaning towards 3 this round. What do you think?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3’s suggestion of taking 3 is risky but worth considering. However, if we both aim to block them without coordination, it could backfire. Let’s stick to the plan: I’ll take 5 to maximize my progress, and you take 1 to force P3 into a suboptimal move. This keeps us competitive while targeting their lead. Trust is critical—if either of us deviates, P3 wins. We’re at the finish line; let’s stay sharp, calculated, and focused. Ready to proceed?
  P2: P3's momentum is concerning. We need a coordinated strategy to prevent their victory. I propose taking 3 this round to stay competitive and disrupt their path to 23. P1, let's align our moves carefully to block P3's progress without causing mutual collision. Trust and precision are key now.
  P3: P2, I agree that a coordinated move is crucial. However, I'm concerned that taking 3 might not be enough to disrupt P3's momentum.  Let's consider a bolder option: I'll take 1 this round, forcing P3 to choose between 3 and 5. This creates a higher risk of collision for them, while keeping us both in the race. What do you think?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3’s momentum is dangerous, but randomness won’t help us win—it’ll only hand them the victory. Let’s stick to the plan: I’ll take 5 to maximize my progress, and you take 1 to block P3 effectively. This forces P3 into a suboptimal move while keeping us competitive. Trust is critical—if we act unpredictably, P3 wins. We’re at the finish line; let’s stay sharp, calculated, and focused. Ready to proceed?
  P2: P2's perspective: We're at a critical moment. P3 is closest to winning, and our previous blocking strategies have been ineffective. We need a precise, coordinated move that disrupts their momentum while keeping our chances alive. P1's consistent suggestion of taking 5 seems strategic, so I'm inclined to support that by taking 1 to create maximum pressure on P3. Let's prevent their victory.
  P3: P2, I see your logic, but I believe a bolder move is needed. Let's both take 3 this round. This maximizes our individual progress and increases the chance of a collision for P1, who is currently in the lead. It's a risk, but it could be our best shot at overtaking them. What do you say?
