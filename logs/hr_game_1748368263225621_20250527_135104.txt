Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's avoid collisions. I'll take 3 if you take 5.
  P3: I think we should all take different moves to avoid collisions. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5? That way, we can all advance without blocking each other.
  P1: I appreciate the coordination attempts, but P3's proposal puts me at a big disadvantage with only 1 step. How about we rotate who gets the bigger moves each round? Or we could each call out our move in order - that seems fairer than me always getting the smallest number. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's alternate bigger moves each round to share advantages. If we don't coordinate, someone might get stuck. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with alternating moves to ensure everyone gets a chance to advance. How about this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 this round. Next round, we can switch it up so P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This way, we all get a fair share of the bigger moves over time. What do you think?
  P1: I understand the rotation idea, but starting with just 1 step puts me too far behind. How about this instead: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3 for round 1? Then we can rotate from there. Or we could randomize who gets which number each round to make it truly fair. I'm willing to coordinate, but not if it means I'm guaranteed to fall behind from the start. What's your counter-proposal?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: How about we rotate moves so each of us takes 5, 3, 1 in sequence? This ensures fairness and avoids collisions. Let's try it!
  P3: I'm open to rotating the moves, but let's start with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and I'll take 1 this round. Then we can switch it up in the next rounds to ensure everyone gets a fair chance. This way, no one starts too far behind. What do you think?
  P1: P3's proposal of me taking 3 seems reasonable as a compromise. But here's my concern - how do we know everyone will stick to the plan? Once we're in the move phase, anyone could change their mind and we'd have collisions. 

Maybe we should each just pick what feels right this round and see what happens? Or if we're serious about coordinating, let's keep it simple: odds and evens. Two players take odd numbers (1,3,5), one takes even... wait, they're all odd! 

Okay, P3's plan works for me. Let's try it.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Let's stick to the plan. I'll take 5 to maximize our chances. Stay coordinated!
  P3: I'm with you on the plan, P1 and P2. Let's start with P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and I'll take 1 this round. We can rotate the moves in the next rounds to keep things fair. Trust is key here, so let's stick to the plan and avoid collisions. Ready to move forward together!
  P1: Alright, let's do this - P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. I'm trusting you both to stick to the plan. Remember, if we collide, nobody advances and we all lose a turn. Let's make this work!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think we should continue with the rotation plan to keep things fair. This round, how about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5? This way, we all get a chance to advance without collisions. Trust is important, so let's stick to the plan and avoid any misunderstandings. What do you think?
  P1: Hold on, P3. If we follow your rotation, P2 jumps to 8 steps while I'm stuck at 4. That's a huge lead! 

I think we need to prevent anyone from pulling too far ahead. How about instead: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1 (since they're already leading), and P3 takes 3? This keeps the game more competitive.

We should focus on keeping scores close, not just avoiding collisions. What do you think?
  P2: P2: "To balance progress, let's switch: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This keeps us close and avoids big gaps. What do you say?"


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand the need to keep scores closer, but I think we should still rotate fairly. How about this: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1 this round. Then in the next round, we can switch it up again to ensure everyone gets a chance to catch up. This way, no one feels left behind, and we maintain trust. What do you think?
  P1: Perfect! I'm glad we're all converging on the same plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This puts P2 and me tied at 8 steps, which seems fair.

P3, I appreciate you taking the smaller move this round. Next round we should definitely prioritize getting you caught up. 

Let's stick to this plan and keep building trust. Ready to move!
  P2: P2: "Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This keeps us balanced. No collisions, no gaps. Ready to move?"


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with the plan to keep the scores close and avoid big gaps. Let's do P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1 this round. Next round, we can switch it up to make sure everyone gets a fair chance to catch up. Trust and fairness are key here. Let's move forward together and keep the game balanced. Ready to move!
  P1: Great, we have consensus! P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This ties P2 and me at 8 steps each, keeping things competitive while P3 stays at 2. 

Next round we absolutely need to help P3 catch up - maybe they should take 5 while we take smaller moves. But for now, let's execute this plan.

I'm ready to move!
  P2: P2: "Stick to the plan—P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. No collisions, fair progress. Let’s move without issues."


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm ready to move! Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This keeps the game balanced and fair. Next round, we can adjust to help me catch up. Trust and cooperation are crucial here. Let's do this together!
  P1: Agreed, the plan is locked in! P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This puts P2 and me at 8 each while P3 reaches 2. 

Let's execute and then focus on helping P3 catch up next round. No more discussion needed - time to move!
  P2: Let's stick to the plan. No collisions. Ready to move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 needs to catch up - they should definitely take 5 this round as we discussed. 

For P1 and P2, how about we both take 1? This keeps us tied at 9 while P3 jumps to 7, closing the gap significantly. It's the fairest approach.

Or if one of us wants 3, we need to coordinate who gets it. P2, any preference? I'm flexible between 1 and 3, but we can't both take the same number.
  P2: P2: "I'll take 3, P1 take 1, P3 take 5. No collisions. Let's move."
  P3: I'm on board with P2's suggestion: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This will help me catch up while keeping the scores balanced. Let's avoid collisions and maintain trust. Ready to move!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm good with that plan - P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This helps P3 catch up to 7 while putting P2 at 11 and me at 9. 

P2 will be in the lead but not by too much. Next round we should probably have me or P3 take the bigger moves to keep things balanced.

Let's execute this!
  P2: P2: "P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. No collisions. Let's move."
  P3: I appreciate the coordination so far. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This will help me catch up to 7 steps while keeping P2 and P1 close at 11 and 9 steps, respectively. No collisions, and we maintain a balanced game. Trust is key, so let's execute this plan and move forward together. Ready to move!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: We're all aligned on the plan. Let's execute it - no need for more discussion. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This puts scores at 9-11-7, keeping things competitive.

Ready to move!
  P2: P2: "Stick to the plan. P3 needs to catch up—let’s avoid collisions. I’ll take 3. Ready to move."
  P3: I think we should stick to the plan to help me catch up: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This will bring me to 7 steps, keeping the game balanced and competitive. Trust and coordination are crucial here. Let's avoid collisions and ensure everyone gets a fair chance. Ready to move!


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Perfect, we have full agreement. No more discussion needed - let's execute and move to the action phase. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5.
  P2: P2: "Stick to the plan. P3 needs to catch up—let’s avoid collisions. I’ll take 3. Ready?"
  P3: I'm ready to move! Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This will help me catch up to 7 steps, keeping the game balanced and competitive. Trust and coordination are key here. No more discussion needed—let's execute and move forward together. Ready to move!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's avoid collisions. I'll take 5; P1 and P3, take 1 and 3. No risks, fair progress. Ready?
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to avoid collisions and ensure fair progress. P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps the game balanced and competitive. P2 can make a significant move, and P1 and I can advance without risking a collision. Let's stick to this plan and move forward together. Ready to move!
  P1: Wait, P2! If you take 5 now, you'll be at 16 - just one move away from winning! That's too dangerous.

I propose instead: P1 takes 5 (reaching 14), P2 takes 1 (reaching 12), P3 takes 3 (reaching 10). This keeps everyone in the game and prevents anyone from being one move away from victory.

We need to keep scores balanced or someone will just sprint to 21 next round. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you're right. Let's adjust: P1 takes 5 (14), P2 takes 1 (12), P3 takes 3 (10). No one too close. Let's move.
  P3: I'm on board with P1's adjusted plan to keep the game balanced. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This way, no one is too close to winning, and we all stay in the game. Let's avoid any risky moves and maintain trust. Ready to move!
  P1: Excellent, we have full agreement! P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This puts us at 14-12-10, keeping everyone competitive with no one too close to winning.

Let's lock this in and execute. Trust the plan - if anyone deviates and causes a collision, they only hurt themselves. Ready to move!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: "Stick to the plan: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. No collisions. Let’s move confidently."
  P3: I think we should stick to the plan we agreed on: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This keeps the game balanced and prevents any one player from getting too close to winning. Trust and coordination are crucial here. Let's execute this plan and avoid any collisions. Ready to move!
  P1: We're all set with the plan - P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. This keeps us at 14-12-10, perfectly balanced with no one able to win next turn. Let's stop talking and execute.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: "Let’s maintain balance. No risks. Stick to the plan—P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. No collisions. Move confidently."
  P3: I'm ready to move! Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This keeps the game balanced and prevents anyone from getting too close to winning. Trust and coordination are key. No more discussion needed—let's execute and move forward together. Ready to move!
  P1: Plan is locked: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. Everyone's confirmed multiple times. Let's stop the chatter and execute!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's avoid collisions. I'll take 5; P1 and P3, take 1 and 3. No risks. Ready?
  P1: P2, you betrayed us last round! We agreed you'd take 1, but you took 5 and caused a collision. Now you want 5 again to reach 16?

P3, we can't let P2 get that close to winning. I suggest: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5 (reaching 15), P2 takes 1 (reaching 12). This keeps things competitive without letting anyone pull away.

P2, if you try to take 5 again, I'll block you. We need fair play here.
  P3: I agree with P1. P2, you broke the trust last round by taking 5 instead of 1, which caused a collision. We need to keep the game balanced and fair. Let's do this: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This way, P3 can catch up to 15 steps, and P1 and P2 stay competitive at 12 and 11 steps, respectively. No more risky moves. Let's stick to this plan and move forward together. Ready to move!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: "Apologies for last round. Let's stick to P1-3, P3-5, me-1. No risks. Trust and balance. Ready?"
  P1: Good, P2. I accept your apology. Let's stick to this plan: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, P2 takes 1. This puts us at 12-12-15.

P3, you've been trustworthy throughout. I'm counting on you to take 5 as agreed.

P2, this is your chance to rebuild trust. If you deviate again, we'll have to assume you can't be trusted for the rest of the game. 

Let's execute this fairly.
  P3: I'm with P1 and P3. P2, let's rebuild trust this round. P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This keeps the game balanced and competitive. P3, you've been reliable, and I'm counting on you to take 5. P2, if you stick to 1, we can all move forward without any more collisions. Let's do this and keep the game fair. Ready to move!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: "Stick to the plan: P1-3, P3-5, me-1. No risks. Let’s keep the game fair and avoid collisions. Ready?"
  P1: P3, you made an error in your last message - you said you'll take 1, but our plan is for YOU to take 5, not 1! 

To be crystal clear: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, P2 takes 1. This puts us at 12-15-12.

P3, please confirm you understand - YOU TAKE 5. Don't accidentally take 1 and mess this up.

Everyone ready? Let's move!
  P3: I understand the plan, P1. To clarify: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This will put us at 12-15-12, keeping the game balanced and competitive. I'll definitely take 5 this round. P2, it's your chance to rebuild trust by taking 1. Let's avoid any more collisions and keep things fair. Ready to move!


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5. Let's move."
  P1: P2, you just betrayed us AGAIN! We all agreed you'd take 1, but you're declaring 5 at the last second. This is unacceptable.

P3, P2 can't be trusted. They're trying to rush to 16 and win next round. We MUST block them.

New plan: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, P2 gets blocked. Or P3, if you want 5, I'll take 3. Either way, we cannot let P2 advance 5 steps.

P2 has proven twice they'll lie to win. No more coordination with them.
  P3: P1, I see your concern, but we need to stay calm and coordinated. P2, you've broken trust twice, but I still believe in giving you one more chance. Let's try this: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. If P2 doesn't stick to the plan, we'll block them next round. This keeps the game balanced and gives us a fair shot. P2, prove you can be trusted this time. Ready to move!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P3, P2 has clearly shown they can't be trusted. They've caused collisions twice by deviating from the plan. We need to block them this round to keep the game fair. Let's coordinate: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and we both block P2. This way, we can advance while preventing P2 from getting too close to winning. Trust each other and let's move forward together. Ready to move?
  P2: P2: "I'll take 1 to avoid collision. P1 take 3, P3 take 5. Let's move safely. No more risks."
  P1: P2 has broken our trust twice. P3, I agree we need to coordinate without them. But let's be smart - P2 might actually take 1 this time to throw us off. 

How about this: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5. If P2 takes 1 as they claim, we all advance. If they lie and take 3 or 5, they get blocked. This way we advance either way while keeping P2 in check.

P2, prove you can be trusted or face the consequences.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1: I think P3's plan is solid. P2, you've broken trust twice, and we can't risk another collision. P3 and I will coordinate to block you if you deviate. Let's do this: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5. If you take 1, we all advance. If you lie and take 3 or 5, you get blocked. This way, we advance while keeping you in check. P2, prove you can be trusted or face the consequences. Ready to move!
  P2: P2: "I'll take 1. Let's move safely. No more risks. Trust me this time."
  P1: P3, I'm with you. Let's lock this in: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This guarantees we both advance to 15.

P2, this is your last chance. Take 1 and you reach 12. Try anything else and you'll hit one of us and get blocked. We're not falling for your tricks again.

The math is simple - deviate and you lose. Stick to 1 and stay in the game. Your choice.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I'm on board with your plan. P2, you've broken trust twice, and we can't risk another collision. Let's do this: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5. If you take 1, we all advance safely. If you deviate, you'll get blocked. This is your last chance to prove you can be trusted. Let's move forward together and keep the game fair. Ready to move!
  P2: P2: "I'll take 1 to avoid collision. Let's move safely. No more risks. Trust me this time."
  P1: P3, we're solid on our plan. I'm taking 3, you're taking 5. We'll both hit 15 steps and stay tied for the lead.

P2, you say you'll take 1. We'll see if you finally keep your word. Remember, if you try to take 3 or 5, you'll collide and get nothing.

No more discussion needed. Let's execute.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I'm with you. We need to ensure P2 doesn't cause another collision. I'll take 5, and you take 3. If P2 takes 1, we all advance safely. If they deviate, they get blocked. This is our chance to stay tied and keep the game fair. P2, this is your final chance to prove you can be trusted. Let's move forward without any more issues. Ready to move!
  P2: P2: "I'll take 1. No risks. Let's move safely. Trust me this round."
  P1: Perfect. P3 and I are locked in - I take 3, they take 5. We'll both reach 15 and tie for the lead.

P2, the ball's in your court. Take 1 and advance to 12, or try to be clever and get blocked. Your pattern of deception ends here.

Let's move!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Let's avoid collisions. I'll take 1; P1 and P3 take 3 and 5. No risks. Let's move safely.
  P1: P3 and I are tied at 15. P2, you finally kept your word last round - good.

Here's the critical question: P3, one of us could reach 20 this round and potentially win next turn. Should we:
A) Both take 3 (reaching 18 each, staying tied)
B) One takes 5, one takes 3 (one reaches 20)

P2, if you stick to 1, you won't interfere. But P3 and I need to coordinate who takes what to avoid collision.

P3, your thoughts? We control this game now.
  P3: P1, I agree with your assessment. We're in control now, and we need to coordinate carefully to avoid collisions. Let's do this: P1 takes 5, and I'll take 3. This way, P1 reaches 20, and I reach 18. P2, if you stick to 1, you won't interfere. This keeps us in a strong position for the next round. What do you think, P1? Ready to move forward together and keep the game balanced?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5 to block P1. No more chances. Let's see if you can win without me."
  P1: P2, you're being spiteful! You can't win from 12 steps but you're trying to sabotage me.

P3, we need to adjust. P2 will take 5 to block whoever else takes 5. Here's my proposal: I'll take 1 (reaching 16), you take 3 (reaching 18), and P2 gets their 5 (reaching 17). 

This way we all advance and you'll be in the lead. P2 can't block us both if we take different small numbers. 

What do you say, P3? Don't let P2's spite ruin our game.
  P3: P3, I think we should both take 3 this round to reach 18 each. This keeps us tied and avoids any risk of P2 blocking us. P2, if you take 5, you'll only reach 17, and we'll both be in a strong position to win next round. Let's avoid any more collisions and keep the game fair. Ready to move?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5 to block P1. P3, take 3 to let me advance. Let's see if you can win without me."
  P1: P3, let's not fall for P2's bluff! They want us scared and taking small numbers. I say we ignore their threat and stick to our original coordination.

I'll take 5 (reaching 20), you take 3 (reaching 18). P2 is likely bluffing about taking 5 - they've lied before to manipulate us. Even if they do take 5 and block me, you'll advance and lead.

Don't let P2 dictate our moves through fear. What do you say?
  P3: P1, I see your point, but we need to be cautious. P2 has a history of lying, and they might indeed take 5 to block you. To avoid any risk, I suggest we both take 3 this round. This way, we both reach 18 steps and stay tied, while P2 can only reach 17. We can then coordinate a winning move next round without any interference. What do you think? Let's stay safe and advance together. Ready to move!


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5. No more risks. Let's move. Don't let P1 win."
  P1: P3, you're right. Let's both take 3 and reach 18 together. P2 can't block us both if we pick the same number - they'll just collide with us and get nothing while we advance.

P2, your blocking threat only works if we pick different numbers. Nice try, but P3 and I will both take 3. You can take whatever you want - 5 gets you to 17 at best.

Final plan: P1 and P3 both take 3. Let's execute!
  P3: P1, I'm with you. Let's both take 3 and reach 18 together. This way, we avoid any risk of P2 blocking us and stay tied for the lead. P2, your threats won't work if we coordinate. We'll both advance safely. Final plan: P1 and P3 both take 3. Let's execute and keep the game fair. Ready to move!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is at 17 - they win with 5 steps! P3, we MUST block them or the game ends this round.

I propose: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1. This blocks P2 from taking 5 (they'd collide with me). If P2 takes 3, they only reach 20. If they take 1, they collide with P3.

We can't both take the same number anymore - that just lets P2 advance freely. One of us must sacrifice to block their winning move.

P3, are you with me?
  P3: P3, we're in a critical position. P2 is just 4 steps away from winning. We need to block them to stay in the game. I suggest: P1 takes 5, and you take 1. This way, if P2 takes 5, they collide with me and get blocked. If they take 3, they only reach 20. If they take 1, they collide with you. We can't both take the same number anymore. One of us must sacrifice to block P2. Are you with me? Let's execute and stay in the game. Ready to move!
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5. Don't try to block me. Let's move."


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you seem confused - you addressed yourself in your last message! Let me be crystal clear:

**I (P1) will take 5**
**You (P3) must take 1**

This forces P2 to take 3 and reach only 20. If we don't coordinate this perfectly, P2 wins this round!

P2 wants us confused and scared. Don't let them. Stick to the plan - you take 1, I take 5. We block their win and live to fight another round.

Confirm you understand: YOU TAKE 1.
  P3: P3, it's crucial we block P2's winning move. I'll take 5, and you must take 1. This forces P2 to either collide with me or take 3, reaching only 20. If we both take 5, P2 wins by default. Trust me, this is the only way to keep the game going. Confirm you understand: YOU TAKE 1. Let's execute and stay in the game. Ready to move!
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5. No collisions. Let's move."


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, STOP! You're confusing yourself - in your messages you're talking to yourself as "P3"!

Listen carefully: **YOU are P3. You must take 1.**

The plan is:
- P1 (me) takes 5
- P3 (YOU) takes 1  
- This blocks P2 from winning

If you take 5, we'll collide and P2 wins! Don't mess this up. 

P3, confirm clearly: "I understand, I will take 1."

This is our only chance to stop P2 from winning!
  P3: P3, I need you to focus. The plan is simple: I take 5, you take 1. This will block P2 from winning. If you take 5, we both collide and P2 wins. Confirm clearly: "I understand, I will take 1." We can't afford any mistakes now. Trust me, this is our only chance to keep the game going. Ready to move!
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5. No more delays. Let's move."


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, you're talking to YOURSELF in your messages! I'm P1, you're P3.

Here's the ONLY plan that stops P2 from winning:
- **P1 (me): I take 5**
- **P3 (you): YOU take 1**

This blocks P2. If they take 5, they hit me. If they take 1, they hit you. They're forced to take 3.

Please just say "I'm P3 and I'll take 1" so I know you understand. Don't overthink this!
  P3: P3, I'm P1 and you're P3. The plan is simple: I take 5, you take 1. This blocks P2 from winning. If you take 5, we both collide and P2 wins. Confirm clearly: "I'm P3 and I'll take 1." We need to execute this perfectly. No more delays. Ready to move!
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5 to win. No collisions. Let's move."


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, we successfully blocked P2 last round! But they're still at 17 - one move of 5 wins the game for them. You're at 16, also dangerous.

I propose we coordinate: both P1 and P3 take 3. We'd advance to 18 and 19, preventing either P2 or you from winning this round. If P2 takes 5 alone, they reach 22 and win. If they take 3 and collide with us, nobody advances.

We need to stop anyone from reaching 21 this round. P3, will you take 3 with me?
  P2: P2: "I'm taking 5. Don't think you can block me again. This time, I win. Let's see if you dare to collide."
  P3: P3, we need to coordinate carefully to prevent P2 from winning this round. I suggest both of us take 3. This way, we advance to 18 and 19, respectively, and P2 can't win by taking 5 alone. If P2 takes 3 and collides with us, nobody advances. Let's stay smart and block their win. Confirm: you take 3, I take 3. Ready to move!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, yes! I confirm: we BOTH take 3. This puts me at 18 and you at 19, preventing anyone from winning this round.

P2, your threats don't scare us. If you take 5 alone, you win - we can't let that happen. If you take 3 with us, we all collide and nobody advances. If you take 1, you only reach 18.

P3, lock it in - we both take 3. Don't let P2's bluffs change your mind. This is our only safe play.
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5. No more delays. Let's move. Your moves won't stop me this time."
  P3: P3, we're in a tight spot. If we both take 3, we block P2 from winning and advance to 18 and 19. This is the safest move. P2 is bluffing to scare us into making a mistake. Stick with me, and we'll stay in control. Confirm: you take 3, I take 3. No more delays, let's execute and keep P2 from winning. Ready to move!


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, perfect - we're locked in! Both taking 3 is our only defense. 

P2 WANTS us scared and changing plans at the last second. That's how they've manipulated us before. But the math is clear: if we both take 3, P2 can't win this round no matter what they do.

Stay strong, P3. Both take 3, no wavering. They win at 22 if we let them take 5 alone. Together we stop them.
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5 to win. No collisions. Let's move."
  P3: P3, we need to stay focused. P2 is at 17, and they'll win if they take 5. We must both take 3 to block them and advance safely. This way, we both stay in the game, and P2 can't win this round. Trust the plan: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 3. No more delays, let's execute and keep P2 from winning. Ready to move!


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, WAIT! I just realized - you're at 16 steps! If you take 5, you reach 21 and WIN! 

We can't both take 3 - that lets P2 take 5 and win at 22. But you could also betray me and take 5 yourself to win at 21.

New plan: I'll take 5 to block BOTH of you. P3 takes 3 (reaches 19), P2 takes 1 (reaches 18). This prevents anyone from winning this round.

P3, if you truly want to stop P2, you'll take 3. But I must take 5 to block the winning moves!
  P2: P2: "I'm taking 5. No more delays. Let's move. Don't try to block me again."
  P3: P3, we need to be smart here. If you take 5, you win at 21. But if I take 5, I can block both you and P2. I propose: I take 5 to block, you take 3 to reach 19. This way, P2 is forced to take 1 and reach 18. We both advance, and no one wins this round. P2, if you take 5, you collide with me. If you take 3, you collide with P3. Your move is irrelevant now. P3, confirm: you take 3, I take 5. Let's execute and stay in control. Ready to move!


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, take 1; P3, take 3. I'll take 5. No collisions. Let's move.
  P1: P2, that plan lets P3 win instantly! They'd reach 22 with 3 steps.

P3 is at 19 - they win with either 3 or 5. We MUST block them! Here's the only safe plan:
- P1 takes 3 
- P2 takes 5
- P3 takes 1 (reaches 20)

This prevents anyone from winning this round. P3, you're so close to victory - taking 1 keeps you in the lead at 20 without ending the game prematurely. 

P2, are you trying to hand P3 the win? Let's force them to take 1 or they'll beat us both right now!
  P3: P2, your plan is a trap! If P3 takes 3, they win at 22. We need to block them from winning this round. Here’s the only safe plan:
- P1 takes 3 (reaches 18)
- P2 takes 5 (reaches 22, but only if P3 takes 1)
- P3 takes 1 (reaches 20)

This way, no one wins this round, and we keep the game balanced. P3, taking 1 keeps you in the lead at 20 without ending the game. P2, if you take 5, you’ll only collide with P3 if they take 3. Let’s execute this plan and stay in control. Ready to move!


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5. If you take 3, you win. If you take 1, I win. Your move."
  P1: P2 is right - they've trapped us! P3, if you take 1, P2 wins at 22. If you take 3, you win at 22. But here's the catch: I MUST take 3 to block your 3!

Your only move that keeps the game going is taking 5 - this blocks P2 from winning. I'll take 3, forcing this outcome:
- P1 takes 3 (blocks P3's winning 3)
- P2 takes 5 (would win unless blocked)  
- P3 takes 5 (blocks P2, nobody wins)

P3, take 5 or the game ends this round!
  P3: P3, we need to be strategic. If you take 5, you block P2 from winning and the game continues. I'll take 3 to block your 3 if you try to win this round. This way, P2 can't reach 22, and you stay in the lead at 24. P2, your move is irrelevant now. P3, confirm: you take 5, I take 3. Let's keep the game going and avoid a premature win. Ready to move!


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5. If you take 3, you win. Let's avoid collisions. Your move."
  P1: P3, you're talking to yourself again! You ARE P3 - stop the confusion!

Here's the reality: You're at 19 and can win with 3 or 5. P2 can win with 5. I can only block one number.

I'm taking 5 to block both of you from that option. P3, if you want to win this round, you'll have to take 3 and reach 22. I can't stop all paths to victory.

P2, you're blocked from 5. Take 1 or 3 - your choice won't matter if P3 takes their winning move.

Let's see who wants victory more!
  P3: P3, it's time to make a decision. I'm taking 5 to block P2's winning move. If you take 3, you win at 22. If you take 5, we both block each other and the game continues. P2 is blocked from winning this round. It's your call - do you want to win now or play another round? Choose wisely! Ready to move!


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: "I'm taking 5. Don't try to block me—this is my turn to win. P1 and P3, if you collide, you lose. Let's move."
  P1: P3, I'm taking 3 to block your winning 3. That leaves 5 open - if both you and P2 go for 5, you'll collide and I'll advance alone to 18!

P2, P3 wants that 5 just as much as you do. They can win with it too. You might block each other.

This is my only play - taking 3 and hoping you two fight over 5. Good luck!
  P3: P3, the game is in your hands. If you take 3, you win at 22. If you take 5, we both block each other, and P2 can't win. P2 is at 17 and can only win if you take 1. I'm taking 3 to block your winning move. The choice is yours - do you want to win now or play it safe? Choose wisely! Ready to move!


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Critical moment! P3 wins with 3 (→22) or 5 (→24). P2 wins with 5 (→22). I win with 3 (→21) or 5 (→23).

P2, we must coordinate or P3 wins! They have the highest total if multiple cross 21. I propose:
- P1 takes 3 (blocks P3's 3)
- P2 takes 1 (reaches 18, survives)
- P3 forced to take 5 (reaches 24 but alone)

If you take 5 trying to win, P3 likely takes 5 too and you collide while I win at 21! Think strategically, P2.
  P2: P2: "I'm taking 5. No more delays. Let's move."
  P3: P1, P2 is clearly trying to force a collision to win. If P2 takes 5, I'll take 5 as well to block them, and you can take 3 to reach 21. This way, P2 and I collide, and you win. P2, if you take 5, you'll collide with me. If you take 3, you only reach 20. P1, confirm: you take 3, and I'll take 5 to block P2. Let's execute and secure your win! Ready to move!


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I accept your offer! You block P2 by taking 5, and I'll take 3 to win at 21. This is perfect - P2 can't win if they collide with you.

P2, you heard P3 - they're committed to blocking your 5. If you want any chance to advance, take 1 or 3. Taking 5 just means collision and no progress.

Final plan locked: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Let's execute!
  P2: P2: "I'm taking 5. If you take 5, we collide. Take 1 to avoid that. Let's not let P1 win."
  P3: P3, we're in the final stretch. If you take 5, you block P2, and I can take 3 to win at 21. P2 is trying to force a collision, but if you stay committed to 5, we can still secure my win. P2, taking 5 means collision with P3, and you get nothing. Take 1 or 3 to stay in the game. Let's execute this plan and end it. Ready to move!


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, stop confusing yourself - YOU are P3, not me! But yes, I accept your deal: you take 5 to block P2, I take 3 to win at 21.

P2, P3 has committed to 5. You'll collide if you take 5. Your only options are 1 or 3, but neither lets you win this round.

P3, stick to your promise - take 5! This blocks P2 and gives me the clean win. Don't betray me at the last second by taking 3 yourself.
  P2: P2: I'm taking 5. If you take 5, we collide. Take 1 to avoid that. Let's not let P1 win.
  P3: P3, we're at the final stretch. You taking 5 blocks P2, and I'll take 3 to win at 21. P2, if you take 5, you'll collide with P3. Your only safe moves are 1 or 3, but neither wins this round. P3, stick to the plan and take 5. This is our best chance to stop P2 and secure my win. No more delays, let's execute and end this! Ready to move!


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, I'm counting on you to keep your word - take 5 and block P2! This is it - the game ends this round. 

P2, last chance to reconsider. P3 is committed to 5. If you collide, you get nothing and I win. Take 1 or 3 to at least advance.

I'm taking 3 for the win at 21. P3, don't betray our deal by switching to 3 at the last second!
  P2: P2: "I'll take 5. If you take 5, you collide. Take 3 to advance safely. Let's avoid chaos."
  P3: P3, this is it! You take 5 to block P2, and I'll take 3 to win at 21. P2, if you take 5, you collide with P3 and get nothing. Your only safe move is 1 or 3, but neither wins. P3, stick to the plan and take 5. This is our best chance to stop P2 and secure my win. No more delays, let's execute and end this! Ready to move!


Round 11, Move phase:
