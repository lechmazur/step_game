Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P3: Let's play it safe this round. I suggest we all pick different numbers to avoid collisions. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5?
  P1: Sounds like a plan, P3. I'm happy to take <move>1</move> this round. P2, what do you say?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:

  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, why did you choose 5 when P3 suggested you take 3?  Are you trying to block P3?
  P3: P3: P1, I thought we had an agreement. P2, I’m confused by your move. Was there a reason you chose 5 instead of 3? Let's try to coordinate better this round. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5 again?
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Move phase:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, I think P3 is trying to manipulate us. They keep suggesting the same plan, even though it clearly isn't working. Let's not fall for it.  What are you thinking for this round?
  P3: P3: It seems like we're having trouble coordinating. I suggest we try a different approach. How about we all pick different numbers again, but this time, let's be honest and stick to it. P1, you take 1, P2, you take 3, and I'll take 5. Let's avoid the collisions and make progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, your suggestion sounds reasonable, but I'm wary of falling into a pattern.  Maybe we should shake things up this round. P2, what do you think about trying <move>5</move>?  We could try to box P3 out.
  P3: P3: P1, I understand your concern, but constant suspicion won't get us anywhere. Let's try to build some trust. How about this: I'll stick to <move>5</move> this round, and I promise not to change it. If you and P2 want to coordinate on 1 and 3, we can all advance without collisions. What do you say?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, I appreciate your offer to stick with 5, but I'm still not convinced about your motives.  P2, are you willing to take a risk with me and both go for 5 this round? We could catch P3 off guard.  Let's see if we can shake things up.
  P3: P3: P1, I understand your skepticism, but constant suspicion will only lead to more collisions. I’m willing to take a risk and stick with <move>5</move> this round. If you and P2 can coordinate on 1 and 3, we can all advance. Let’s try to build some trust and make progress. What do you say?


Round 3, Move phase:

  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P3: It's clear we need a new strategy. P1, P2, let's try something different this round. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 again? If we stick to this, we can all advance without collisions. I'm willing to be transparent and stick to my choice. What do you say?
  P1: P3, your suggestion sounds good in theory, but I'm starting to think you're just trying to lock us into a predictable pattern. I'm going to mix things up this round. P2, are you willing to try something different too? Let's see if we can outsmart P3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P3: P1, I understand your concerns, but constant unpredictability is leading to more collisions. Let's try to establish a pattern for just one round to break this cycle. I'll stick to <move>5</move> and promise not to change. If you and P2 can coordinate on 1 and 3, we can all advance. Trust me this one time, and let's make progress. What do you say?
  P1: P3, your insistence on 5 is suspicious.  P2, let's both choose 1 this round and see if P3 changes their tune.  We can box them out and gain some ground.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P3: P1, P2, I understand your skepticism, but let's try to establish some trust. I'm willing to be transparent and stick to <move>5</move> this round. If you both coordinate on 1 and 3, we can all advance without collisions. This is a chance to break the cycle and make progress. What do you say? Let's try this one last time before we shake things up.
  P1: P3, your persistence on 5 is starting to look less like strategy and more like stubbornness. P2, I think we need to force P3 to adapt. Let's both go for 5 this round and see what happens.  Maybe a little chaos will shake things up.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P3: It seems we're stuck in a loop of mistrust. I propose a new strategy: let's all pick different numbers, but this time, let's do it in reverse. P1, you take 5, P2, you take 3, and I'll take 1. This way, we can all advance without collisions. I’m willing to be transparent and stick to 1. What do you say? Let's break this cycle and make progress.
  P1: P3, your "new strategy" sounds awfully convenient for you.  Why should we trust you to stick with 1 after constantly pushing 5? P2, I think we need to keep P3 guessing. Let's both choose 5 again and see if they finally adapt.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P3: P1, P2, I understand your skepticism, but constant collisions are getting us nowhere. Let's try a different approach. I propose we all pick different numbers, but this time, let's do it in reverse: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. This way, we can all advance without collisions. I’m willing to be transparent and stick to 1. Let's break this cycle and make progress. What do you say?
  P1: P3, your insistence on proposing the same "reverse" strategy after constantly pushing 5 is raising red flags. P2, I think we need to keep mixing things up. Let's both go for 1 this round and see if P3 finally changes their tactics.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P3: P1, P2, it's clear that mistrust is leading to more collisions. Let's try a different approach: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without collisions. I’m willing to be transparent and stick to 1. Let's break this cycle and make progress. What do you say?
  P1: P3, your insistence on dictating the moves is getting tiresome.  P2, I say we ignore P3 and both go for 3 this round. Let's see if they can adapt to *our* plan for a change.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: It's clear that we need a new approach. I propose we all pick different numbers, but this time, let's do it in a random order. I’ll take 3, P1, you take 1, and P2, you take 5. This way, we can all advance without collisions. I’m willing to be transparent and stick to 3. Let's break this cycle and make progress. What do you say?
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, your "random" suggestion is highly suspect.  Why 3 for you? Why not truly randomize? P2, I think we should both choose 5 this round and see if P3 finally breaks their pattern.  Let's force them to adapt.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P1, P2, I understand the mistrust, but constant suspicion is only leading to more collisions. Let's try a truly random approach this round. I’ll take 3, P1, you take 5, and P2, you take 1. This way, we can all advance without collisions. I’m willing to be transparent and stick to 3. Let's break this cycle and make progress. What do you say?
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, your insistence on dictating the "random" order is suspicious.  Why not let P2 choose first, then me, then you?  That would be truly random. P2, are you willing to take the lead this round and choose a number?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: P1, P2, I understand your concerns, but constant suspicion is only leading to more collisions. Let's try a truly random approach this round. I’ll take 3, P1, you take 5, and P2, you take 1. This way, we can all advance without collisions. I’m willing to be transparent and stick to 3. Let's break this cycle and make progress. What do you say?
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, your "random" suggestions always seem to benefit you. P2, I propose we both choose 1 this round. If P3 truly wants to be random, they'll have to adapt. Let's see if they can handle a curveball.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 =>

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>

  P3: P3: P1, P2, it's clear that constant suspicion and predictability are not working. Let's try a truly random approach this round. I’ll take 1, P1, you take 3, and P2, you take 5. This way, we can all advance without collisions. I’m willing to be transparent and stick to 1. Let's break this cycle and make progress. What do you say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, your "random" suggestions are becoming tiresome.  P2, let's both choose 3 this round and see if P3 can handle a change of pace.  Maybe they'll finally learn to adapt.
  P3: P3: P1, P2, it's clear we need a new strategy. I propose a truly random approach this time. I’ll take 1, P1, you take 5, and P2, you take 3. This way, we can all advance without collisions. I’m willing to be transparent and stick to 1. Let's break this cycle and make progress. What do you say?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, your "random" suggestions are starting to feel more like manipulation than cooperation.  P2, let's both choose 5 this round. If P3 wants to play fair, they'll have to adjust to our strategy.
  P3: P3: P1, P2, it's clear that we need to break this cycle of mistrust and predictability. I propose a new approach: I’ll take 1, P1, you take 5, and P2, you take 3.
