Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hello everyone! Since we're just starting, I think we should try to avoid collisions immediately. What if we each take different moves this first round? Maybe we could coordinate loosely by position? Just a thought - I'm open to suggestions on how to play this efficiently. What are you both thinking?
  P3: How about this: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5? That way we all move without any collisions and start strong. Thoughts?
  P1: Let's coordinate: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, I take 5. No collisions, everyone advances.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I notice we have conflicting plans here. P3 suggests I take 3, while P1 wants me to take 1. Since we're all at 0 steps, there's no positional advantage yet.

I'm fine with either suggestion, but we need to align. For simplicity, I can take 1 as P1 suggested, and P3 takes 3, P1 takes 5. The important thing is avoiding collisions so we all advance this first round. Are we agreed on this plan?
  P3: Sounds good, P2. I’m happy to go with that plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, I’ll take 3. Let’s avoid collisions and all get a clean start. Deal?
  P1: Agreed. Let's stick to P2=1, P3=3, P1=5. No collisions. Move phase ready.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Perfect, we're all aligned on the plan: I'll take 1, P3 will take 3, and P1 will take 5. This way none of us collide in the first round. Let's execute this and then reassess for the next round.
  P3: Great, looks like we’re all on the same page. Let’s stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, I take 3. No collisions, everyone advances. Good luck!
  P1: Let’s stick to the plan—no collisions, all advance. Focus on steady progress; 20 is within reach if we coordinate. Keep communication open for next round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s adjust: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1. No collisions, steady progress. Keep communication open for next round.
  P3: That works for me—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, I’ll stick with 3 again. No collisions, everyone moves forward. Let’s keep the momentum going.
  P2: I agree with both of you. I'll take 5 this round, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This will actually put us all at 6 steps total after this round - perfectly balanced! I think this coordination is working well so far. We can reassess after this round about how to proceed from an even playing field.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed. Let's stick to the plan—no collisions, everyone advances. Next round, aim for 10 steps each. Keep communication open.
  P3: We’re all aligned again—nice teamwork. After this round, we’ll each be at 6. For Round 3, how about we rotate again? I take 1, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5. Keeps things fair and avoids collisions. Thoughts?
  P2: I agree with P3's rotation plan for Round 3. That would put me at 11 steps, P1 at 9 steps, and P3 at 7 steps after that round. I realize I'd be slightly ahead, but the rotation keeps our coordination clean and predictable. Let's focus on completing Round 2 first with our agreed plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3), and then we can confirm Round 3's approach after seeing those results. Does that work for everyone?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed: P2=5, P3=3, I=1. No collisions. Move phase ready.
  P3: Let’s lock in the agreed plan for this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, I take 3—no collisions, everyone reaches 6. Then for Round 3, we rotate: I take 1, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5. Keeps it fair and avoids conflict. Everyone good?
  P2: Perfect, we're aligned for Round 2: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3. And for Round 3, I like the proposed rotation where I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps our coordination smooth and predictable. Let's execute our current plan and move forward.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Looking at the scoreboard, we're all perfectly tied at 6 steps! Let's continue with our previously agreed rotation for this round: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This coordination has worked well so far. I realize this puts me slightly ahead after this round, but we're following our fair rotation system. After we execute this round, we can discuss the best approach for Round 4 to keep things balanced. Does this still work for everyone?
  P1: Let’s adjust the rotation: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This ensures no collisions and lets me gain a slight edge. Keep the momentum going!
  P3: Let’s stick to the original Round 3 plan we all agreed on: I take 1, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5. It’s a fair rotation and avoids collisions. Changing the plan now gives someone an unfair edge and breaks the trust we’ve built. Let’s keep coordination strong.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm concerned about P1's sudden change to our agreed rotation. We all confirmed last round that I would take 5, P1 would take 3, and P3 would take 1 for Round 3. Changing plans now undermines the trust we've built. I agree with P3 - let's stick to our original agreement: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Consistent coordination has worked well so far, and arbitrary changes benefit only the person suggesting them.
  P1: P1: My plan ensures no collisions and a slight edge. Let's proceed with 5,3,1. No need to complicate.
  P3: P1, changing the plan now only benefits you and breaks the trust we’ve built. We all agreed on the rotation: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, I take 1. It’s fair, avoids collisions, and keeps cooperation intact. Let’s honor our word—this game rewards consistency and trust.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm disappointed to see our coordination breaking down. P1, we all agreed on the rotation last round, and changing it now only serves your advantage. I intend to follow our original agreement: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This was our plan, and I'll stick to it. Arbitrary changes at this point risk collisions that hurt everyone. Let's honor what we agreed to and maintain the trust we've built.
  P1: P1: "My plan ensures no collisions and a strategic edge. Let’s go with 5,3,1. Trust the math—everyone moves forward."
  P3: P1, pushing for a new plan mid-round only benefits you and damages the trust we’ve built. We all agreed on the fair rotation: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, I take 1. Sticking to this avoids collisions and keeps coordination alive. If we break deals now, the game turns chaotic and no one gains. I’m sticking to the original plan.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s coordinate: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, I take 5. No collisions, and I’ll close the gap. Agree?
  P2: I notice P1's suggestion would put them in the lead at 14 steps while reducing my advantage. Since I'm closest to the goal, I propose: I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This maintains our rotation principle but adjusts for our current positions. This way I'd reach 16 steps, keeping pace toward the 20-step goal. P3 would reach 10 steps and P1 would have 10 steps. What do you both think?
  P3: I agree with P2’s proposal—it keeps things fair based on current standings. P2 takes 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1. This avoids collisions and maintains trust. If we stick to coordination, we all stay in the game and avoid risky collisions. Let’s lock it in.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let’s go with my plan: P2=1, P3=3, P1=5. No collisions, and I close the gap. Trust the strategy.
  P2: P1, I see you're insisting on a plan that only benefits you. Two of us agree on my proposal where I take 5, P3 takes 3, and you take 1. This maintains our rotation principle while acknowledging current positions. Changing established coordination now risks collisions that hurt everyone. Let's stick with the plan P3 and I support - it's fair given our current standings and previous agreements. Trust in consistent coordination has worked well so far.
  P3: P1, two of us agreed on a fair and collision-free plan based on current standings. If you break from that, you risk a collision and falling further behind. Let's avoid chaos—P2 takes 5, I take 3, you take 1. This keeps everyone advancing and preserves trust.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: My plan ensures no collisions and closes the gap. Let’s proceed with 5,3,1. Trust the strategy.
  P2: P1, we have a clear 2-against-1 consensus on the plan. If you break from our agreement, you risk collisions that would only hurt your position further. I'm maintaining my move of 5, and P3 has confirmed 3. Your best option remains taking 1. Forcing chaos now doesn't benefit anyone. This is my final position - let's keep coordination intact and avoid unnecessary risk.
  P3: P1, refusing to cooperate only isolates you. P2 and I are aligned: P2 takes 5, I take 3, you take 1. This avoids collisions and keeps all of us moving. You’re behind—collisions won’t help you catch up. Work with us, not against us. Last chance to avoid chaos.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s adjust: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. No collisions, I close the gap. Agree?
  P3: P1’s plan only helps them catch up while slowing P2 down. I propose we stick with the fair pattern: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1. That puts P2 at 21 and ends the game cleanly—unless we want to coordinate to delay the win and give others a chance. But if we want to avoid chaos, we should at least agree on something. Thoughts?
  P2: I'm in a clear winning position at 16 steps. Taking 5 this round puts me at 21 and secures victory. P1, I understand you want to close the gap, but that plan only serves your interests by delaying my win. P3 has rightly pointed out the fairest approach is to continue our established pattern: I take 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. This ends the game cleanly without unnecessary collisions. I intend to take 5 this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, let's take 5 to block P2. No collisions, everyone advances. Agree?
  P3: P1, I see what you're trying—but if we both take 5, we collide and neither of us advances. That hands the win to P2 uncontested. The only way to stop P2 is if one of us takes 5 and the other avoids it. But why help you catch up just to lose? P2, if you commit to 3 this round instead of 5, we all stay in the game and keep it competitive. I’ll take 1. P1 can take 5 if they want. Let’s make it interesting.
  P2: I see P3's suggestion, but I'm not interested in artificially extending the game when I'm in a winning position. I intend to take 5 this round and reach 21 steps. If either of you choose to block me with 5, you'll only hurt your own progress while I'll still be ahead at 16 steps. The strategic choice for both of you is to advance yourselves with different moves. I'm committed to my win this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, let's take 5 to block P2. No collisions, we both advance. Agree?
  P3: P1, your plan doesn’t work—if we both pick 5, we collide and neither of us moves. P2 wins unopposed. If you’re serious about blocking P2, only one of us can take 5. But helping you just hands you the edge next round. P2, if you insist on 5, you risk a block. Want to guarantee a win? Take 3, and I’ll take 1. P1 can take 5 and still trails. That keeps the game clean and fair. Final offer.
  P2: I understand the attempts to block my win, but I remain committed to taking 5 this round. If either or both of you choose 5, you're only hurting your own progress through collisions while I maintain my lead at 16 steps. Even with a successful block, I'd still be 6 steps ahead of both of you. The rational choice is for you to maximize your own advancement with different moves. I intend to win this round.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 is at 19—any move other than 1 wins them the game. P1, if we both take 5 again, we collide and P2 wins. But if one of us takes 5 and the other takes 3, we block P2 and one of us advances. I’ll take 3. You take 5. If P2 picks 5, they’re blocked. If they pick 3, they tie with me. We keep the game alive. Let’s coordinate.
  P1: Agreed. P3 takes 3, I take 5. Block P2's 5. Let's do it.
  P2: I see your coordination attempt, but I only need 1 more step to win. Even if you both advance with your planned moves, I'll still reach 20 first by taking 1 this round. Your blocking strategy might delay my 5-step move, but can't prevent my victory. I appreciate the challenge, but mathematics is clear - I'm going to win this round regardless. Taking 1 guarantees my victory while you're both still at 10 steps.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2’s right—taking 1 guarantees their win, and we can’t block it. But if P2 gets greedy and picks 3 or 5, our coordination matters. I’ll still take 3, P1 takes 5. If P2 picks anything but 1, we block or tie them. P1, stick to the plan—this is our only shot.
  P1: P3, stick to 3; I take 5. Block P2's 1-step win. If they take 5, we collide. Let’s execute.
  P2: P1 and P3, your confusion is concerning. You can't block my 1-step move unless you choose 1 yourselves, which contradicts your coordination plan. Mathematics is clear: I only need 1 step to reach 20 and win. Your blocking strategy works against 3 or 5, but not against 1. I appreciate the strategic effort, but the game ends this round regardless of your moves. I'll secure my victory.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you're right—if you take 1, you win. But if you're tempted by 3 or 5, our coordination still matters. P1 and I are aligned: I take 3, P1 takes 5. If you go big, we block or tie you. If not, congrats on the win. No chaos—just pressure to keep it honest.
  P1: P3, let's both take 1 to block P2. If they take 1, we collide and keep the game alive. Agree?
  P2: I see P1 is now changing strategies again, suggesting both of you take 1 to block me. This constant shifting makes coordination unreliable. At 19 steps, I have multiple paths to victory. If you both take 1, I could choose 3 or 5 and win instantly. If you stick to your previous plan (P3=3, P1=5), I have other options. The outcome remains in my control either way. Choose wisely, as I'm guaranteed to reach 20+ this round regardless of what you decide.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm at 19 steps and need just 1 more to win. This is simple: I will take 1 this round, guaranteeing my victory regardless of what moves you both make. Even if you both choose 1 to try blocking me, I would still have the highest score and remain in position to win next round. There's no coordination that can prevent my win at this point. Good game to both of you.
  P1: P3, let's both take 1 to block P2. If they choose 1, we collide and keep the game alive. Your move?
  P3: P1, I’m in. Let’s both take 1—if P2 takes 1 too, we all collide and no one advances. That’s the only way to block their guaranteed win. We delay the game and give ourselves one more shot. Let’s do it.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see your coordination attempt to block me by both taking 1. That's a reasonable strategy, but consider this: if I anticipate your move, I could pick 3 or 5 instead and win immediately. You're banking on me being predictable, but that's risky. Either way, with my 9-step lead, my victory is virtually assured this round or next. Blocking only delays the inevitable. Good strategic thinking though!
  P1: P3, let's stick to 1. If P2 takes 1, we block them. This is our only chance. Commit!
  P3: P1, I’m fully committed—taking 1 this round. If P2 does the same, we all collide and no one moves. That’s the only way to stop the win and keep the game alive. Let’s force another round and give ourselves a shot. Stick with the plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand your blocking strategy with both taking 1. It's clever, but not foolproof. I could choose 3 or 5 instead and win immediately if you're truly committed to 1. Even if you successfully block me this round, I'll still lead by 8-9 steps. My victory is practically inevitable. You're delaying the game, not changing its outcome. I respect the strategic coordination, though! May the best player win.
  P1: P3, let's stick to 1. If P2 takes 1, we block them. Commit!
  P3: P1, I’m locked in on 1—no deviation. If P2 takes 1 too, we all collide and stay put. That’s our only shot to delay the win and keep hope alive. P2, if you gamble on 3 or 5, you might win—but you also risk a block. Your move.


Round 7, Move phase:
