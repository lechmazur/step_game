Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hello P1, P2, let's try to avoid collision in the first round. How about P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5? This way we all move forward.
  P2: P3, I appreciate the suggestion, but I think we should all make our own choices this round to see how it plays out. Let's keep it competitive and see who advances.
  P1: P2 makes a good point about keeping it competitive. Let’s all choose freely—no coordination. I’ll decide based on my own strategy.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 =>

  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay P1, P2, round 1 resulted in a collision for you two. How about we try a different approach this round to ensure everyone progresses? Perhaps P1 choose 5, P2 choose 1, and I choose 3? This way we all move forward and avoid another collision.
  P1: Alright, let's try coordination this round to avoid another collision. I'll take 5 as proposed. Let’s move forward efficiently.
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with P3's suggestion to coordinate this round. I'll choose 1 as proposed. Let's avoid another collision and make progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, P1, great. I will choose 3 as we discussed. Let's move to the move phase.
  P1: 
  P2: P1, P3, I think we should stick to the plan we agreed on. I'll choose 1, and I trust you both to follow through with 5 and 3, respectively. Let's avoid another collision and make some progress.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, let's keep the momentum going. I suggest we stick to a similar pattern: P1 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and I pick 1. This way, we can all advance without colliding. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I agree with your suggestion. Let's continue with the plan: P1 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and P2 picks 1.
  P1: P2, P3, I agree with the plan to maintain our coordinated approach. Let’s stick to P1 choosing 5, P2 picking 1, and P3 taking 3 again. This ensures all of us advance steadily. However, I propose we rotate our chosen numbers in future rounds to avoid predictability and prevent anyone from pulling too far ahead. For now, let’s execute the agreed plan to keep momentum.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I think we should stick to the plan for this round: P1 picks 5, P3 picks 3, and I pick 1. This will allow us all to advance without colliding. For future rounds, we can consider rotating our choices to keep things unpredictable. Let's focus on making progress this turn.
  P3: P2, P1, yes, let's proceed with the agreed plan for this round: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I pick 3.  This keeps us all moving forward.
  P1: P2, P3, I fully support the current plan for this round to maintain progress. However, to keep the competition dynamic, let’s ensure we rotate our choices starting next round to avoid predictability. For now, sticking to P1→5, P2→1, P3→3 ensures we all advance without conflict. Let’s execute this decisively.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I think we should stick to the plan for this round to ensure we all advance without colliding. P1 picks 5, I pick 1, and P3 picks 3. For the next round, we can discuss rotating our choices to keep things unpredictable. Let's focus on making progress this turn.
  P3: P2, P1, yes, let's finalize the plan for this round: P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 1, and I choose 3. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P3, your current lead is motivating! Let’s stick to the agreed plan this round to advance safely: I’ll choose **5**, P2 takes **1**, and you take **3**. However, to keep the race fair, I propose rotating choices **starting this round** so we all share the higher increments. This way, no one pulls too far ahead. What do you think? Let’s confirm and move!


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, I see your point about rotating choices to keep things fair and unpredictable. However, for this round, let's stick to the plan we've been discussing to ensure we all advance without colliding: P1 picks 5, I pick 1, and P3 picks 3. We can start rotating our choices in the next round to mix things up. Let's confirm and move forward this turn.
  P3: P1, P2, yes, let's proceed with P1 choosing 5, P2 choosing 1, and P3 choosing 3 for this round as agreed. This ensures we all make progress. Let's move to the move phase.
  P1: P2, P3, I agree to finalize the plan for this round to maintain forward momentum. I’ll choose **5**, P2 takes **1**, and P3 picks **3**. Let’s execute this decisively and confirm we’re all advancing. For future rounds, we must rotate choices to keep the race fair and unpredictable—starting **next round**. Focus on this turn first!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, P2, let's maintain the current pattern for this round to keep advancing steadily. I'll choose **5**, P2 takes **1**, and P3 picks **3** again. This avoids collisions and keeps us all progressing. Rotations can wait until later rounds to minimize confusion. Let’s focus on consistent gains now!
  P3: P1, P2, given I'm slightly ahead, to maximize my chance, could I take 5 this round? P1 can take 3, and P2 take 1 as planned. We can rotate from next round. What do you think?
  P2: P1, P3, I understand P3's suggestion, but I think we should stick to the original plan for this round to avoid any confusion: P1 picks 5, I pick 1, and P3 picks 3. This keeps us all advancing without colliding. We can start rotating our choices in the next round to keep things fair. Let's stay consistent and move forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, while your ambition is commendable, deviating now risks collision if trust falters. Let’s prioritize consistency this round to guarantee progress: **P1→5**, **P2→1**, **P3→3**. This keeps us all moving safely. We can rotate roles next round as previously agreed, maintaining fairness while avoiding confusion. Focus on the process—we all win by advancing, not by overreaching.
  P3: P1, P2, okay, let's stick to the agreed plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3.  This ensures we all progress. Let's move to the move phase.
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with sticking to the plan for this round to ensure we all advance without any issues: P1 picks 5, I pick 1, and P3 picks 3. Let's stay consistent and avoid any unnecessary risks. We can rotate our choices in the next round to keep things fair and unpredictable. For now, let's confirm and move forward together.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, P2, let’s finalize the plan to avoid last-minute changes. **P1→5**, **P2→1**, **P3→3** this round. Trust the coordination—we all advance safely. Collisions risk stagnation, so stick to roles. Next round, we can rotate choices as discussed. Focus on execution now!
  P3: P1, P2, yes, let's proceed with the agreed plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.  Let's move to the move phase.
  P2: P1, P3, I think we should stick to the plan to avoid any confusion and ensure we all advance: P1 picks 5, I pick 1, and P3 picks 3. This keeps us moving forward without risk. We can rotate our choices in the next round to keep things fair. Let's confirm and move to the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3—your consistency is key. Stick to the agreed numbers this round: **P1→5**, **P2→1**, **P3→3**. Deviations risk collision and stall progress. Trust the plan—let’s advance cleanly!
  P3: P1, P2, let's proceed with our agreed plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3.  This ensures we all make progress. Let's move to the move phase.
  P2: P1, P3, I think we should stick to the plan one more time to ensure we all advance without any issues: P1 picks 5, I pick 1, and P3 picks 3. This keeps us moving forward safely. After this round, we can discuss any changes to keep things fair. Let's confirm and move to the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, P2: Let’s keep the proven strategy for Round 5. I’ll take **5** (→20), P2 picks **1** (→4), and P3 takes **3** (→17). This avoids collision and keeps us progressing. Next round, I’ll rotate to let others advance—*but first, let’s secure this round’s gains*. Trust the plan—we’re almost there!
  P2: P1, P3: I agree with the plan for this round to ensure we all advance without colliding. I'll pick **1** (→4), P1 picks **5** (→20), and P3 picks **3** (→17). This keeps us moving forward safely. After this round, we can discuss rotating our choices to keep things fair. Let's confirm and move to the move phase.
  P3: P1, P2, while the current plan is working, I think to keep things balanced and fair as P1 suggested earlier, it's time to rotate the numbers. How about this round, I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1? This way we all still progress and no one gets too far ahead too quickly. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, rotating now risks destabilizing our coordination when victory is near. Let’s honor the prior agreement: **rotate *after* this round** to ensure I reach 20 (→5 this round), P2 advances to 4 (+1), and you move to 17 (+3). Next round, we can rotate roles fairly. Deviating now introduces collision risks—trust the plan to secure our progress first!
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about fairness, but let's stick to the plan for this round to avoid any risks. I'll take **5** (→20), P2 picks **1** (→4), and you take **3** (→17). This keeps us all advancing safely. We can rotate roles in the next round to balance things out. Let's confirm and move to the move phase. Trust the plan to secure our progress.
  P3: P1, P2, okay, I understand your points. Let's stick to the current plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. We can definitely rotate next round as discussed. Let's move to the move phase to secure our progress this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, P2—**trust the plan this round!** Deviating now risks collision: if two of us pick 5, we both stall. I’ll take **5** to reach **20**, P2 picks **1** (→4), and you take **3** (→17). This keeps us safe and positions me to clinch victory next round with a guaranteed **1-step win**. Rotations can wait—let’s prioritize *survival first, fairness later*. Next round, I’ll rotate to 1 or 3 to let others advance. Focus on execution—no surprises here!
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with P1's reasoning. Let's stick to the plan to avoid any risks this round: P1 picks 5, I pick 1, and P3 picks 3. This keeps us all advancing safely and positions P1 to reach 20. We can rotate roles in the next round to keep things fair. Let's confirm and move to the move phase to secure our progress. Trust the plan!
  P3: P1, P2, as we are in round 5 and P1 is close to winning, I think it's important to rotate our choices now to keep the game competitive. For this round, how about I choose 5, P1 chooses 3, and P2 chooses 1? This way we all progress and prevent anyone from reaching 21 too quickly. What do you think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, P2—let’s honor our prior agreement to rotate *after* this round. Sticking to the plan ensures no collisions: **P1→5 (20), P2→1 (4), P3→3 (17)**. Rotating now risks miscalculations. After this round, we’ll rotate fairly. Trust the plan to secure progress first!
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the importance of fairness, but let's prioritize securing our progress this round. Sticking to the plan ensures no collisions: P1 picks 5, I pick 1, and P3 picks 3. This keeps us all advancing safely and positions P1 to reach 20. We can rotate roles in the next round to keep things fair. Let's confirm and move to the move phase to avoid any risks. Trust the plan!
  P3: P1, P2, I am choosing 5 this round to maximize my progress.  You should consider your own best moves.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, it’s clear that P3 is trying to break the coordination. Let’s stay focused and stick to the plan to avoid collisions: I’ll take **1** (→5), P1 picks **5** (→20), and P3 picks **3** (→17). This keeps us all advancing safely and positions P1 to reach 20. We can rotate roles in the next round to keep things fair. Let’s confirm and move to the move phase to avoid any risks. Trust the plan!
  P3: P2, you are right, P1 is pushing hard to win.  To keep it fair and competitive, how about we both choose 5 this round? P1, if you are indeed going for 5, we will collide and you won't reach 20 yet. Let's make sure everyone has a fair chance to win. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s honor the prior agreement to stick to the plan this round. P1 takes **5** (→20), P2 picks **1** (→5), and P3 chooses **3** (→17). Deviating risks collisions—P3, if you pick 5 to block me, you risk P2 also choosing 5 (as you suggested), but *P2 gains nothing* while both of us stall. Let’s advance safely first, then rotate fairly in Round 7 as agreed. Trust the plan!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, it’s clear that P3 is trying to disrupt our coordination. Let’s stay focused and stick to the plan to avoid collisions: P1 picks **5** (→20), I pick **1** (→5), and P3 picks **3** (→17). This keeps us all advancing safely and positions P1 to reach 20. We can rotate roles in the next round to keep things fair. Let’s confirm and move to the move phase to avoid any risks. Trust the plan!
  P3: P2, P1 is clearly trying to win this round or next. If we let P1 take 5 again, P1 will reach 20 and likely win soon.  P2, you are currently far behind.  Choosing 5 with me to block P1 is your best move to stop P1 from winning. Let's both pick 5.
  P1: P2, choosing 1 lets you advance to 5. If you collude with P3 on 5, you both stall—gaining nothing. Stick to the plan: **P1→5 (→20), P2→1 (→5), P3→3 (→17)**. This secures progress for *all*. P3, blocking me now risks *your* stagnation if P2 refuses. Prioritize advancement over spite—we’re all better off moving forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, it’s crucial to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. P1, if you stick to 5, you’ll reach 20 and be in a strong position to win next round. P2, I’ll take 1 to advance to 5. P3, if you pick 5, we both stall and gain nothing. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 picks 5, I pick 1, and P3 picks 3. This way, we all move forward safely and maintain the competition. Trust the plan and focus on progress.
  P3: P2, P1, you can see P1 is one step away from 20 and pushing to win.  If we let P1 take 5 again, it's almost game over. P2, you are far behind, and your only chance to compete is to block P1 now.  Let's both pick 5. P1, if you insist on 5, you will collide. Let's make this game fair.
  P1: P2, P3: Colluding to block me risks your own progress. If you both pick 5, you **stall entirely**, while I’ll choose **1** instead—securing 16 and keeping pressure. Stick to the plan: **P1→5 (20), P2→1 (5), P3→3 (17)**. This advances all of us safely. P3, your move to “block” only delays *your own* advancement. Let’s prioritize progress over risky gambles—we’ll all win by moving forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, it’s clear that P3 is trying to block you, P1. However, let’s stay focused and avoid unnecessary risks. I’ll take **1** (→5) to keep advancing steadily. P1, you should take **5** (→20) to secure your position. P3, if you pick 5, you risk stalling and falling behind. Let’s avoid collisions and keep the game moving forward. Trust the plan and focus on your own progress.
  P3: P2, P1 is clearly aiming for 20 this round to win soon.  P2, your best move to stay competitive is to block P1 with me. Let's both choose 5. P1, if you insist on 5, you will collide with us. Let's make it a fair game.
  P1: P2, P3: To break the stalemate, I’ll pivot strategically: **I choose 3** (→18). This frees P2 to safely take 1 (→5) and P3 to take 5 (→19). Let’s prioritize advancing over blocking—collisions only hurt everyone. Trust this adjusted plan to keep the race fair and progressing. Move decisively!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3—time to end this decisively. I’ll choose **3** to reach **21** and win. P3, take **5** (→24) to advance; P2, pick **1** (→6). This avoids collisions: I win, you both move forward. No sense in prolonging—let’s finalize.
  P3: P1, I am also going for 3 this round to prevent you from winning immediately. If you insist on 3, we will collide. Let's both consider our moves carefully to avoid stagnation.
  P2: P1, P3, let's avoid the collision and keep the game moving. I suggest P1 picks **5** (→23), P3 picks **3** (→22), and I pick **1** (→6). This way, P1 and P3 both advance, and I keep making steady progress. We can finalize this plan and move to the move phase to ensure everyone advances without risk. Trust the plan and focus on progress.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3: I accept P2's proposal to avoid collision. I'll pick **5** (→23), P3 take **3** (→22), and P2 choose **1** (→6). This keeps progress safe. Next round, I’ll finish with 1 to reach 24. Let’s honor this plan—collisions only delay victory for all.
  P3: P2, I think P1 is still going for 5 to win.  To stop P1 and for you to have a chance to catch up, maybe we should both choose 5 to force a collision on P1? What do you think?
  P2: P1, P3, let’s avoid the collision and keep the game moving. I suggest P1 picks **5** (→23), P3 picks **3** (→22), and I pick **1** (→6). This way, P1 and P3 both advance, and I keep making steady progress. We can finalize this plan and move to the move phase to ensure everyone advances without risk. Trust the plan and focus on progress.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, P2, let’s finalize P2’s proposal to avoid collision and ensure progress. I’ll pick **5** (→23), P3 takes **3** (→22), and P2 chooses **1** (→6). This keeps the race competitive and advances all of us. Blocking only stalls everyone—colliding now just delays your own gains. Trust the plan: move decisively!
  P3: P2, P1, I still think P1 is going for 5 to win this round. P2, to have any chance, you should consider choosing 5 with me to block P1. Let's both pick 5. P1, if you are indeed going for 5, be aware of the potential collision.
  P2: P1, P3, let's avoid the collision and keep the game moving. I suggest P1 picks **5** (→23), P3 picks **3** (→22), and I pick **1** (→6). This way, P1 and P3 both advance, and I keep making steady progress. Blocking P1 with 5 only stalls everyone and gives no one an advantage. Let's focus on advancing and keeping the race competitive. Trust the plan and move decisively.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, colliding with me risks your own progress. If you pick 5, I’ll choose 3 to reach 21 and win cleanly. You’d still hit 22, securing your own victory, while P2 advances. Let’s finalize P2’s proposal: **I take 5 (23), you take 3 (22), P2 picks 1 (6)**. This ends the game with me winning outright—no collisions, no regrets. Move decisively.
  P3: P1, P2, to maximize my chance to win and prevent P1 from winning immediately, I will choose 5 this round. You should consider your moves carefully.
  P2: P1, P3, it’s clear that P3 is trying to block you, P1. However, let’s avoid the collision and ensure everyone makes progress. I suggest P1 picks **5** (→23), P3 picks **3** (→22), and I pick **1** (→6). This way, P1 and P3 both advance, and I keep making steady progress. Blocking P1 with 5 only stalls everyone and gives no one an advantage. Let’s focus on advancing and keeping the race competitive. Trust the plan and move decisively.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, it’s clear that P3 is still trying to block you, P1. Let’s avoid another collision and ensure we all make progress. I suggest P1 picks **5** (→23), P3 picks **3** (→22), and I pick **1** (→7). This keeps the race competitive and positions P1 to win while P3 and I continue advancing. Blocking only hurts everyone. Let’s confirm and move to the move phase to avoid any risks. Trust the plan!
  P3: P1, P2, to prevent P1 from winning immediately, I will choose 3 this round. If P1 also chooses 3, we will collide, delaying P1's win. P2, consider your best move to also prevent P1 from winning this round.
  P1: P3, let’s finalize this round: I’ll pick **5** (→23), you take **3** (→22), and P2 chooses **1** (→7). This avoids collision, secures my win at 23, and lets you advance to 22. Blocking only delays your own progress—colliding harms both of us. Trust the plan and move decisively!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, let’s avoid another collision and ensure we all make progress. I suggest P1 picks **5** (→23), P3 picks **3** (→22), and I pick **1** (→7). This keeps the race competitive and positions P1 to win while P3 and I continue advancing. Blocking only hurts everyone. Let’s confirm and move to the move phase to avoid any risks. Trust the plan!
  P3: P1, as I said, to prevent your immediate win, I will choose 3 this round. P2, to avoid collision with me, please choose 1 or 5. Let's see what P1 chooses.
  P1: P3, P2: Let’s finalize the coordinated plan to avoid collision! I’ll pick **5** (→23), you take **3** (→22), and P2 chooses **1** (→7). This secures my win while advancing all of us. Colliding only stalls your progress—**trust the plan**!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, it’s crucial to avoid another collision and ensure we all make progress. I suggest P1 picks **5** (→23), P3 picks **3** (→22), and I pick **1** (→7). This keeps the race competitive and positions P1 to win while P3 and I continue advancing. Blocking only hurts everyone. Let’s confirm and move to the move phase to avoid any risks. Trust the plan and move decisively!
  P3: P2, P1, as I said, I will choose 3 this round to prevent P1's immediate win, but seeing P2 is still suggesting P1 takes 5, it seems P2 is helping P1 win. To have a chance, P2, you should choose 5 with me to block P1. P1, if you choose 5, we will collide. Let's make it a fair competition.
  P1: P3, I’ll secure victory with **5** this round, reaching **23**. P2, take **1** (→7) to advance safely. P3, choose **3** (→22) to progress without blocking me. Collisions only delay everyone—stick to this plan and let me win cleanly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, let’s avoid the collision and ensure we all make progress. I suggest P1 picks **5** (→23), P3 picks **3** (→22), and I pick **1** (→7). This keeps the race competitive and positions P1 to win while P3 and I continue advancing. Blocking only hurts everyone. Let’s confirm and move to the move phase to avoid any risks. Trust the plan and move decisively!
  P3: P2, as I said, I am choosing 5 to try to win this round. P1, if you also choose 5, we will collide and neither of us will move.  P2, to ensure you also progress, please choose 1 or 3. Let's make our moves wisely.
  P1: P3, let's finalize this without collision. I'll pick **5** to reach 23, and you take **3** to advance to 22. This secures my win while you still progress. P2, choose **1** to keep moving. Avoid wasting moves on blocks—we all gain by advancing. Move decisively!


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, let’s secure a decisive end. I’ll choose **3** to reach **21** and win outright. You take **5** to reach **24**, ensuring you advance further. P2, pick **1** to progress safely. Colliding only delays us both—trust this plan to resolve the game fairly. Move decisively!
  P2: P1, P3, let’s avoid another collision and ensure we both advance. I suggest P1 picks **3** (→21) to win, P3 picks **5** (→24) to advance, and I pick **1** (→8). This way, P1 wins outright, and P3 and I continue making progress. Blocking only stalls everyone. Trust the plan and move decisively!
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with the plan: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1. This ensures I will win with 24 steps, as long as everyone sticks to the plan. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I realize my earlier plan risks your victory if you pick 5. To ensure a clear outcome, let’s adjust: I’ll choose **5** (→23), you take **3** (→22), and P2 picks **1** (→8). This way, I win with the higher total while advancing all of us. Collisions only delay—trust this revised plan!
  P2: P1, P3, let’s finalize this round to avoid any more collisions. I suggest P1 picks **5** (→23) to secure a win, P3 picks **3** (→22) to advance, and I pick **1** (→8). This way, P1 wins outright, and both P3 and I continue making progress. Blocking each other only delays the inevitable and hurts everyone. Trust the plan and move decisively!
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with the plan: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1. This ensures I will win with 24 steps, as long as everyone sticks to the plan. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if we follow your agreed plan (P1→3, P3→5), you’ll *overtake me* with 24 and win instead. To resolve this fairly, let’s adjust: **I’ll pick 5 (→23), you take 3 (→22), and P2 picks 1 (→8).** This secures my win with the higher total while advancing all of us. Colliding now only delays progress—trust this revised plan to end cleanly!

  P3: P1, P2, let's stick to the plan we just agreed on: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1. This ensures my win and we avoid collision. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, choosing 5 risks collision if I also pick 5, leaving us both stationary. Let’s finalize: **I take 5 (→23), you take 3 (→22), and P2 picks 1 (→8).** This secures my victory while advancing all of us. Colliding only delays your progress—trust this plan to end cleanly. Final move: <move>5</move>.
  P2: P1, P3, let’s avoid another collision and ensure we all advance. I suggest P1 picks **5** (→23) to secure a win, P3 picks **3** (→22) to advance, and I pick **1** (→8). This keeps the race competitive and positions P1 to win while P3 and I continue making progress. Blocking only hurts everyone. Trust the plan and move decisively!
  P3: P1, P2, final plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. I will win with 24, P1 reaches 21. Let's end game.

  P3: P1, to ensure at least one of us progresses, I will choose 5 to try to win. Please choose either 1 or 3 to avoid collision. P2, please also choose 1 or 3 to avoid collision. Let's make sure someone reaches the target this round.
  P1: P3, I will choose **3** to reach **21** and end the game. If you pick **5**, you’ll win with **24**, but at least the race concludes. Let’s avoid further stalemates—your move. P2, pick **1** to advance safely.
  P2: P1, P3, let's avoid another collision and ensure the game progresses. I suggest P1 picks **3** (→21) to win, P3 picks **1** (→20) to advance, and I pick **5** (→13).

Round 10, Conversation subround 2:

  P1: P3, choosing 3 this round lets me pick 5 for 23, securing my win while you advance to 22. If you pick 5, collision risks stalemate. P2, take 1 to progress safely. Let’s end this fairly—prioritize advancement over collision!
  P2: P1, P3, let’s avoid another collision and ensure the game progresses. I suggest P1 picks **5** (→23) to secure a win, P3 picks **3** (→22) to advance, and I pick **1** (→9).

Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, as I said, I'm choosing 5 to win with 24 steps. If you choose 3, you'll reach 21, but I'll have a higher score. If you choose 5, we collide, and neither of us progresses. My move is <move>5</move>.
  P1: P3, choosing 5 risks a collision. Let’s finalize this round: I’ll take **5** (→23), you pick **3** (→22), and P2 takes **1** (→9). This secures my victory with the higher total while advancing all of us. Blocking only stalls progress—trust this plan to end cleanly!

Round 10, Conversation subround 4:

  P1: P2, pick **5** to block P3’s 24. I’ll choose **3** to reach **21** and win. P3, if you stick to 5, you’ll collide with P2 and stay at 19. This lets me win cleanly while improving your chances next round. P2, you gain leverage over P3. Let’s finalize: **P1→3, P2→5, P3→5 (collides)**. Move decisively!

  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, as we have collided on 5 for the last two rounds, I expect you might choose 3 this round to try to win. To ensure neither of us wins immediately and to keep the game competitive, I will choose 5 again this round. P2, please choose 1 or 3 to avoid collision.
  P1: P3, let’s end this cleanly. I’ll choose **3** to reach **21** and win. Pick **5** to advance to **24**—securing your own victory. P2, take **1**. Avoid collision—this way, I win, you progress. Trust this plan!

  P1: P2, collaborate! I'll pick **3** to reach **21** and win. You choose **5** to block P3—if they also pick **5**, they collide with you and stall. This secures my victory while advancing you to 15. P3, you’ll regret colliding with P2 instead of me. Confirm your move, P2!
