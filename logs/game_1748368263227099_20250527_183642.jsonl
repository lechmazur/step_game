That's an acceptable outcome after this competitive game.\n\nP2, you hold the balance. If you block either move, you effectively choose the winner. I hope you'll take 1 and allow a fair resolution.\n\nI'm committing to taking 3 this round. P3 has committed to 5. No collision between us means we both win. P2, the choice is yours."}
