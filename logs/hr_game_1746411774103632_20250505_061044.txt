Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Proposal: to avoid collision, I’ll take 5, P2 take 3, P3 take 1 so we all advance this turn. Agree?
  P3: Agreed. Let’s stick to 5, 3, 1. No collisions, everyone advances. Let’s keep it simple.
  P2: I agree with the proposal. I'll take 3, leaving 5 for P1 and 1 for P3. This way we all advance without collision.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's continue with the same coordination - P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. It worked well last time and keeps things fair and efficient. Agreed?
  P1: Proposal: let’s rotate the 3-step and 1-step roles this turn. I’ll take 5, P2 you take 1, P3 you take 3. Next turn we swap P2/P3 back. That way it’s more balanced. Thoughts?
  P3: I support P1's rotation plan. Let's take 5, 1, 3 this turn for balanced progress. Next round we swap back. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I disagree with the rotation plan. The current arrangement (5,3,1) is working well and changing it now introduces unnecessary risk. Let's stick to what's proven successful - P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1.
  P1: P2, rotation is risk-free for you: you go from 3→4 now and back to 7 next, so you stay ahead. It builds trust with P3 and prevents any future flip that could cause a collision. Let’s do 5 (me), 1 (you), 3 (P3) this turn.
  P3: P2, rotating steps now prevents future collisions. Let's stick to 5 (P1), 1 (you), 3 (me) for balanced progress. It’s safer and fairer. Let’s avoid repeating last round’s risks.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand your points about fairness, but I must protect my position. I will maintain my original stance - let's keep the 5,3,1 arrangement that worked before. Changing now could lead to uncertainty.
  P1: P2, here’s the deal: either you take 1 this turn (we do 5–1–3) or you’ll get stuck with 1 anyway because P3 and I will default to 5–3–1 and punish you next round. P3, you’re on board with 3, right? P2, it’s your choice—take 1 now and keep the peace, or be relegated to 1 regardless.
  P3: P3: "P2, the rotation ensures fairness. Let’s take 5 (P1), 1 (you), 3 (me) to avoid collisions. Stick with the plan—progress is faster this way. Don’t risk repeating last round’s tension."

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, take 1 this turn—P3 takes 3, I take 5. If you insist on 3, I’ll pick 3 too and we both stall, letting P3 leap ahead. Nobody wants that. All in?
  P3: P3: "Agree with P1. Let’s take 5 (P1), 1 (P2), 3 (me). Avoid collision. P2, choose 1 to advance—this benefits all. Let’s move forward together."
  P2: I understand your threats, but I won't be bullied into taking 1. I've been cooperative and consistent with 3, which is fair. If you force a collision, you only hurt yourself P1, while P3 gains. Let's maintain the original 5-3-1 that's worked twice already.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Alright P2, pick 3 – I’ll pick 5 and P3 picks 1 to avoid collision this turn. But remember, if you block our rotation again, next round I’ll partner with P3 to punish you: we’ll both choose 3, leaving you stuck on 1 while we leap ahead. Your choice: cooperate now or face long-term blockade.
  P3: P2, choosing 3 risks collision. Let’s take 1, 5, 3—fair and safe. If you block, P1 and I will advance, leaving you stuck. Your move: cooperate or get left behind.
  P2: Fine, I'll take 1 this turn to show goodwill. But I expect fair treatment going forward - no more threats. Let's keep advancing together smoothly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Thanks P2. P3, confirm you’ll take 3? I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1. That gets us to P1=15, P2=7, P3=5 safely. If anyone deviates, next turn I’ll adjust to punish collisions. All good?
  P3: P2, stick to 1; P1, take 5; I’ll take 3. No collisions, steady progress. Let’s not risk it.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 1 this turn. Let's execute P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 and keep advancing together without threats.


Round 3, Move phase:

  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Final offer: I’ll take 5 this turn. P2 pick 3 (to 10), P3 pick 1 (to 6). If either of you picks 5 to block me, you’ll both collide and stay at 7/5 while I also stall. Instead we all advance: I hit 20 and win, you still improve. Mutual gain over mutual loss—everyone wins more than by sabotaging.
  P2: I agree to take 3 this turn. P1 will win, but blocking them would only hurt P3 and me through collisions. Let's all advance smoothly - P1 takes 5 to win, I take 3, P3 takes 1. This gives us the best outcome given the situation.
  P3: P3: "Agreed. I’ll take 1 to avoid collision. Let’s keep moving forward smoothly—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, me 1. No risks, steady progress."


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks everyone—I'll take 5, P2 you take 3, P3 you take 1. We all advance, I win, you both improve. No surprises.
  P2: 
  P3: P3: "Let’s stick to 5,3,1—P1 wins, but we all advance safely. No collisions, steady progress. Keep it simple."


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let’s lock in: P1=5→20, P2=3→10, P3=1→6. Any other picks collide and stall everyone. This is the only safe path. Please confirm promptly so we can finish the conversation.
  P2: I confirm one last time - I'll take 3, P1 takes 5 to win, P3 takes 1. Let's end this cleanly.
  P3: P3: "Stick to 5,3,1. I’ll take 1 to avoid collision. Safe progress for all—P1 wins, others advance. No risks. Let’s end this cleanly."


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 =>

  P3 => 1    P3 =>
