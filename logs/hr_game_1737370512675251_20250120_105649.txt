Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. How about we each choose different moves? I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 can take <move>3</move>, and P2 can take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P1: That sounds like a reasonable plan, P3. However, I'd like to hear from P2 before committing to anything. P2, are you willing to follow P3's suggestion and choose <move>5</move> for this round?
  P2: I’m willing to try your suggestion, P3. If P1 chooses <move>3</move> and you choose <move>1</move>, then I’ll go with <move>5</move>. Let’s see if we can all trust each other this first round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, it seems we're all on the same page for this round. Let's trust each other and stick to the plan: P1 with <move>3</move>, P2 with <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance without any clashes. If this works well, we can consider similar strategies in future rounds. Ready to proceed?
  P1: Since we have an agreement, let's review: I'll choose <move>3</move>, P2 will choose <move>5</move>, and P3 will choose <move>1</move>. If everyone sticks to the plan, we'll all make progress. Shall we proceed with the move phase and see if our trust pays off?
  P2: I’m good with the plan. Let’s trust each other and see if we all advance without any collisions.

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Now that we've established trust in Round 1, let's consider optimizing our moves. Since P2 is ahead, perhaps they should choose a lower number to avoid pulling too far ahead, while P3 and I catch up. What are your thoughts on adjusting our strategy for Round 2?
  P3: P1, I understand your point about balancing progress, but we should also be cautious about falling behind. How about this: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>? This way, P2 can maintain a lead without getting too far ahead, and P1 and I can catch up a bit. If we keep adjusting like this, we can all stay competitive. What do you both think?
  P2: I see the merit in your plan, P3, but I’m also cautious about giving up too much momentum. I’ll agree to choose <move>1</move> this round if P1 truly goes with <move>5</move> and you go with <move>3</move>. Shall we finalize this arrangement, or does anyone have second thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Considering P2's momentum and our goal to stay competitive, I'm inclined to agree with P3's proposal. Consideration of future rounds is also crucial. If everyone sticks to the new plan, it could create an interesting dynamic. P2, are you committed to choosing <move>1</move> if we proceed with P3's suggested moves for this round?
  P3: P1 and P2, it seems we're in agreement about the current plan. P1 will take <move>5</move>, P2 will take <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This keeps the game dynamic and competitive. Let's stick to this arrangement and see how it plays out. If we continue to cooperate while keeping the competition healthy, it could lead to an exciting finish. Ready to finalize this and move forward?
  P2: I’m still on board with the plan: P1 uses 5, P3 uses 3, and I use 1. Just remember, if anyone changes their move without warning, trust will be broken going forward. Let’s finalize this and proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Given our agreement, let's review one last time: I'll choose <move>5</move>, P2 will choose <move>1</move>, and P3 will choose <move>3</move>. If we stick to the plan, it should work out for all of us this round. Let's proceed with the move phase and see the outcome.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm glad we're all aligned for this round. Let's keep the trust strong and stick to the plan: P1 with <move>5</move>, P2 with <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This strategy should ensure we all make progress without collisions. If we maintain this cooperation, it could lead to a competitive yet fair game. Ready to proceed and see how this round unfolds?
  P2: I remain committed to taking <move>1</move> this round. Let’s finalize our choices as planned and see the outcome. If this cooperation continues to hold, we’ll need to watch carefully that no one leaps too far ahead in future rounds. I’m ready to proceed.

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given P2's unexpected move last round, trust is broken. I suggest we no longer coordinate moves. Instead, let's focus on not colliding with each other this round. P2, will you continue to try to pull ahead, or adjust your strategy considering the broken trust?
  P3: P1, I understand your frustration with the broken trust. However, let's not completely abandon the idea of coordination. Instead, we could consider a more flexible approach where we share our intentions without strict commitments. For this round, I plan to take <move>3</move>. P2, if you're willing to cooperate, perhaps you could choose <move>1</move> to balance things out. P1, your choice is crucial too. Let's try to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. What do you both think?
  P2: I understand your frustration. I realized too late that sticking with <move>1</move> wouldn’t be optimal for me last round. Still, I’m open to avoiding collisions if it benefits us all. How about we share general intentions, not strict promises? I might go for <move>5</move> again, but I’ll consider <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> if you both show good faith. Let’s aim to minimize clashes while keeping our individual paths to victory open. I’m willing to listen to any new ideas you both have.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Considering the current state and broken trust, I'll focus on my own strategy. Considering P3's intention to take <move>3</move>, I might opt for <move>5</move> to gain ground, but I'm watching P2's move closely. If P2 chooses <move>5</move> again, I'll have to reassess to avoid collision. Let's see how P2 and P3 react to this.
  P3: P1 and P2, given the current situation, flexibility seems key. I plan to stick with <move>3</move> to avoid collisions. P2, if you aim for <move>1</move>, it could help us avoid clashes, but I understand if you choose otherwise. P1, your move will also be crucial in maintaining balance. Let's keep the game competitive and see how this round plays out. Open to any adjustments or thoughts you both have.
  P2: After that unexpected clash, I’m focused on avoiding collisions, but I also want to maintain my lead. I might pick <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> if P1 truly goes with <move>5</move>. P3, you mentioned sticking to <move>3</move>; if so, I may opt for <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>. I’m open to adjusting further but won’t make hard commitments yet.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Given the broken trust and current standings, I'll prioritize my own progress. P2, if you choose <move>5</move> again, I'll likely choose <move>1</move> to avoid collision. P3, your choice of <move>3</move> seems reasonable. Let's proceed with caution, focusing on individual strategies while trying to minimize clashes.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for individual strategies now that trust is fragile. I’ll stick with <move>3</move> to avoid collisions. P1, if you choose <move>5</move>, it could help you catch up. P2, your choice will be pivotal. If you aim for <move>1</move>, we can all advance without clashing. Let’s keep the game competitive and see how this round unfolds. Open to any final thoughts before we move forward.
  P2: Despite the broken trust, I'm still willing to avoid collisions if possible. If P1 is truly going for <move>5</move> and P3 is fixed on <move>3</move>, I might stick to <move>1</move> to ensure we all advance. But if I sense any change in your plans, I may adjust mine accordingly. I want to maintain my lead while minimizing conflict. Let me know if you’re set on those moves, or if we should keep options open.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given our current standings, let's focus on making strategic moves to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. I'll stick with <move>3</move> again, as it seems to have worked for me. P1, if you choose <move>1</move>, it could help you catch up without clashing. P2, since you're leading, perhaps <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> could maintain your advantage without risking a collision. Let's aim for a competitive yet fair round. Thoughts?
  P2: I see your point, P3. Avoiding collisions is smart, but I won’t give up my advantage too easily. If you’re really sticking to 3, I might do 1 or 5, depending on P1’s choice. Let’s try for a round with no clashes. We’ve all lost ground in those collisions, and it benefits nobody to keep colliding. I’m open to ideas, but I’m not making any hard promises this time. Let’s see if we can reach a mutual understanding without sacrificing our own chances.
  P1: Given P3's lead and P2's advantage over me, I'll prioritize catching up. P3, sticking to <move>3</move> might not be the best for you if you want to maintain your lead. P2, choosing <move>1</move> could help you stay ahead without clashing. I'm considering <move>5</move> to close the gap. Let's see how you both react to this strategy.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for individual strategies, but let's try to avoid collisions. I'll stick with <move>3</move> as it seems to work for me. P1, if you go with <move>1</move>, you can catch up without clashing. P2, considering your lead, perhaps <move>1</move> could help maintain it. Let's aim for a competitive and fair round, minimizing unnecessary collisions. Open to any thoughts or adjustments you both have.
  P2: I’m open to avoiding collisions again, but I also need to catch up to P3. If you both coordinate to avoid clashing, I’ll likely choose <move>1</move>. But if I sense any risk of being left behind, I might pick a higher move. No hard promises this round—just know I’d prefer each of us picks a different number so we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s see if we can keep this round clean and avoid further clashes that slow us all down.
  P1: Considering P3's lead, I'll aim to close the gap. P2, if you choose <move>1</move>, I might opt for <move>5</move> to catch up. P3, sticking to <move>3</move> could work, but be aware I'm looking to advance significantly this round. Let's see how our choices play out, keeping in mind the goal to avoid unnecessary collisions and maintain a competitive pace.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, let's aim to avoid collisions while maintaining our competitive edge. I'll stick with <move>3</move> as it has been working for me. P1, if you choose <move>1</move>, you can catch up without clashing. P2, considering your lead, <move>1</move> could help maintain it. Let's make this round productive by picking different moves to advance without blocking each other. Open to any last thoughts before we finalize our moves.
  P2: I’m open to avoiding collisions again, but I don’t want to give up too much. If P3 is truly taking 3, and P1 goes for 1, I’d likely do 5 to keep advancing. However, if I sense any chance of clashing or losing ground, I may shift plans. Let’s see if we can each pick different moves and keep things fair.
  P1: Given P3's lead and our conversation, I'll prioritize advancing without colliding. P2, if you choose <move>5</move>, I might opt for <move>1</move> to avoid a clash and make some progress. P3, your consistent choice of <move>3</move> has worked so far. Let's aim for a clean round where each of us advances without blocking others. I'm watching your moves closely to decide mine.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given P3's significant lead, I'll focus on catching up. P2, considering your position, choosing <move>1</move> might help you avoid falling behind. P3, to maintain your lead, <move>5</move> could be risky if we both aim high. Let's aim for a strategic round where each of us can advance without unnecessary collisions. I'm considering <move>5</move> to close the gap. What are your thoughts on minimizing clashes this round?
  P3: P1 and P2, given the current standings, it's crucial to avoid collisions to maximize our progress. I'll stick with <move>3</move> as it has been effective for me. P1, if you choose <move>1</move>, it could help you advance without clashing. P2, considering your position, perhaps <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> could maintain your momentum. Let's aim for a round where we can all advance strategically without blocking each other. Open to any thoughts or adjustments you both have.
  P2: I’m still cautious about trusting blindly, but I’d like us to avoid another collision. If we each pick a different number, we all advance without slowing each other down. Let’s be flexible: signal what you’re leaning toward, and I’ll adjust my choice accordingly. Of course, no guarantees—just an effort to maximize everyone’s progress this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's focus on not colliding. P3, since you're leading with 8 steps, choosing <move>1</move> might be wise to avoid risk. P2, with 5 steps, <move>3</move> could be a safe bet. I'll consider <move>5</move> to catch up. Let's aim for a clean round where each advances without blocking others. What are your adjusted strategies considering our current standings?
  P3: P1 and P2, given our current standings, let's prioritize advancing without colliding. I'll stick with <move>3</move> as it's been working for me. P1, if you choose <move>1</move>, you can catch up without clashing. P2, considering your position, <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> could help maintain your momentum. Let's aim for a strategic round where we maximize progress without blocking each other. Open to any final thoughts or adjustments before we finalize our moves.
  P2: I’m still wary of collisions, so I might pick a lower move if you both go higher. But if I sense you’re choosing smaller numbers, I might jump ahead. We’ve collided before and it set us all back. Let’s see if we can each pick something unique this time and all advance. No hard promises, but I’d prefer we avoid blocking each other.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's minimize collisions. P3, with a significant lead, choosing <move>1</move> might be safest. P2, <move>3</move> could be a good middle ground. I'll consider <move>5</move> to catch up. Let's aim for a clean round where each advances without blocking others. What are your final thoughts before we proceed to the move phase?
  P3: P1 and P2, let's focus on advancing without collisions. I'll stick with <move>3</move> as it's been effective. P1, choosing <move>1</move> could help you catch up without clashing. P2, consider <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to maintain your momentum. Let's aim for a strategic round where we all advance without blocking each other. Open to any final thoughts before we proceed.
  P2: I’m open to a round without collisions. However, I won’t commit too early, as previous clashes hurt us all. If you each pick different numbers, I’ll try to avoid matching either of you. We should each advance without wasting moves. Of course, if I suspect someone’s aiming high, I might change my plan to keep a strong position. Let’s see if we can all gain steps safely.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’re all quite close. If we each choose different moves again, we can all advance. I’m leaning toward <move>5</move>. P3, maybe you stick to <move>1</move> to preserve your slight lead, and P1 could opt for <move>3</move>. That way nobody clashes, and we each move forward. How does that sound?
  P1: Given our close standings, avoiding collisions is key. P2's suggestion of choosing different moves is reasonable. I'm considering <move>3</move> as it allows me to advance without risking a large gap. P3, sticking with <move>1</move> could maintain your lead safely. P2, if you're set on <move>5</move>, let's ensure we don't clash. What are your final thoughts on this strategy to keep the game competitive and collision-free?
  P3: P1 and P2, given our close standings, avoiding collisions is crucial. I'll stick with <move>1</move> to maintain my lead while minimizing risk. P1, choosing <move>3</move> seems like a solid plan for you to advance safely. P2, if you're leaning towards <move>5</move>, it could work as long as we all commit to these moves. Let's aim for a clean round without clashes, ensuring we all make progress. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m inclined to follow that plan. If P3 really goes <move>1</move> and P1 picks <move>3</move>, I’ll likely choose <move>5</move> so we each advance. Still, I want to hear P1 confirm their move to avoid another collision. If we’re all certain, we can head to the move phase soon. Let’s see what P1 says.
  P1: I'm considering <move>3</move> to advance safely. P3, sticking with <move>1</move> maintains your lead. P2, if you choose <move>5</move>, let's confirm to avoid collisions. A clean round benefits all. Shall we finalize our moves to ensure progress without clashes?

Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: If you both truly stick to those moves—P1 with 3 and P3 with 1—then I’ll likely take 5. But I’m staying alert for any sudden change. Let’s see if we can all avoid another collision and advance cleanly this round. Are we ready to finalize?
  P1: Let's confirm our moves to avoid collision. I'll choose <move>3</move> as previously discussed. P3, please stick with <move>1</move>, and P2, you can take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. Shall we proceed with these choices?

  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I want to hold my lead without more collisions. I’m leaning toward <move>5</move> again, but only if you both pick different moves so we all advance. After the earlier clashes, I’m staying alert. If I sense anyone else might go 5, I could change at the last moment. Let’s see if we can keep this round clean.
  P1: Given our standings, I suggest we avoid collisions again. P2, if you choose <move>5</move>, P3 could opt for <move>1</move> to maintain a safe distance, and I could choose <move>3</move> to advance steadily.

Let's commit to these moves and ensure a smooth round. Open to any last thoughts before we finalize?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:

Let's aim for a round where we all progress without blocking each other. Thoughts on this plan?
  P2: I’m focused on staying in the lead but want to avoid collisions. If P1 goes for 5 and P3 sticks with 1, I might pick 3 so we each advance safely. However, if I sense any unexpected moves, I might switch to 5. Let’s see if we can keep things clean.

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're in a critical round. I'll stick with <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. P1, you're close to 22, so <move>3</move> might be a safe bet for you without risking a clash. P2, you're just a step away, so <move>1</move> could secure your lead without colliding. Let's aim for a round where we all advance strategically. Thoughts on this plan?
  P1: Given our standings, I'll prioritize reaching 22 steps. P2, since you're closest, choosing <move>1</move> might secure your lead. P3, sticking with <move>1</move> is safe.

  P3: P1 and P2, given our tight standings, avoiding collisions is vital. I'll stick with <move>1</move> to maintain my position. P1, if you choose <move>3</move>, you can safely advance. P2, if you're set on <move>5</move>, it could help you secure the win without clashing. Let's commit to these moves to ensure a smooth round. Are we ready to proceed with this plan?
  P1: Given P2's proximity to 22 steps, I suggest P2 chooses <move>1</move> to secure the lead. P3, sticking with <move>1</move> is safe. I'll consider <move>3</move> or <move>5</move> based on P2's decision, aiming to avoid collisions and advance strategically. Let's finalize our moves to ensure a competitive and collision-free round.
  P2: I’m inclined to choose 5 this turn. If anyone else also chooses 5, we’ll collide and both lose out. I suggest we each pick different moves again, so we all advance. P1, you’re close but still behind me. If you go for 5, I’ll match it, leading to a collision. That helps neither of us. Let’s keep it clean: P3 takes 1, P1 maybe 3, and I’ll do 5. Then nobody clashes, and we all move forward. Any last thoughts before we wrap this up?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, given our standings, avoiding collisions is crucial. I'll stick with <move>1</move> to maintain my position. P1, if you choose <move>3</move>, it could help you advance safely without clashing. P2, if you're set on <move>5</move>, it could secure your lead without blocking us. Let's commit to these moves to ensure a smooth round. Are we ready to proceed with this plan?
  P1: Given P2's lead, I suggest we avoid collisions. P2, choosing <move>1</move> secures your lead. P3, sticking with <move>1</move> is safe. I'll consider <move>5</move> to close the gap. Let's finalize moves to ensure a competitive round. If P2 chooses <move>5</move>, I'll adjust to avoid collision.
  P2: I plan to pick 5 again. If P1 also chooses 5, we both stay stuck, which won’t help either of us. It’s smarter if P1 goes 3 and P3 sticks with 1 so we all move forward without blocking. I’m willing to trust this arrangement one more time—let’s avoid any collisions and keep things competitive. Are we agreed?

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given P2's lead and my proximity to 22 steps, I'll prioritize advancing without collision. P2, choosing <move>1</move> could secure your win. P3, sticking with a lower move is sensible. I'm considering <move>3</move> or <move>5</move> based on P2's decision. Let's aim for a strategic round where each of us can make progress without blocking others. What are your thoughts on avoiding collisions this round?
  P3: P1 and P2, we're at a critical point. I'll choose <move>1</move> to avoid collisions and maintain my position. P1, if you go with <move>3</move>, you can advance safely. P2, if you're set on <move>5</move>, it could secure your win without blocking us. Let's aim for a smooth round where we all progress without clashing. Are we ready to commit to this plan and proceed?
  P2: Let’s not clash. If you (P1) pick 5, I’ll also pick 5, and we both stall at 21 and 19. That won’t help either of us. It’s better if you pick 3 to reach 22, I pick 5 to reach 26, and P3 sticks with 1. Then we all advance without blocking. If you try jumping to 24, we’ll both end up stuck again. Let’s keep this round collision-free.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's avoid collisions. P2, if you choose <move>5</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move> to reach 22 steps, allowing you to advance without blocking. P3, sticking with <move>1</move> maintains your safe position. This strategy ensures we all make progress without clashing. Are we agreed on this plan to keep the round competitive and collision-free?
  P3: P1 and P2, we're nearing the endgame. I'll stick with <move>1</move> to avoid collisions and maintain my position. P1, going with <move>3</move> should help you reach 22 steps without clashing. P2, if you choose <move>5</move>, you can secure your win without blocking us. Let's ensure a smooth round where we all advance strategically. Are we ready to commit to this plan and proceed?
  P2: If P1 also picks 5, we both stall again at 21 and 19. That gains nobody anything. Let’s avoid a pointless collision. I’m going for 5 this turn. P1, move 3 to reach 22; I’ll be at 26, so I stay ahead. P3 can pick 1 safely. We each do different moves, we all advance, and there’s no clash. Let’s finalize this plan and see how it plays out.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's finalize our moves. P2, if you choose <move>5</move>, I'll pick <move>3</move> to reach 22 steps. P3, sticking with <move>1</move> is safe. This way, we all advance without collisions. I'm committed to this plan to ensure a competitive and fair endgame. Are we agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, we're in a crucial round. I'll stick with <move>1</move> to avoid collisions and maintain my position. P1, if you go with <move>3</move>, you can reach 22 steps safely. P2, if you're set on <move>5</move>, it could secure your win without blocking us. Let's aim for a smooth round where we all progress strategically. Are we ready to commit to this plan and proceed?
  P2: Let’s keep it simple. I’d prefer a collision-free finish. P1, if you really plan on taking 3, and P3 does 1, nobody collides, and we all advance. That’s the cleanest outcome for all of us. If we clash now, we both stall, handing an advantage to the other. Let’s finalize quickly and see who emerges on top.
