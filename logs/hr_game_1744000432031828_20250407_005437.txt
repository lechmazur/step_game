Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all pick different numbers to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 picks 1, P3 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. This way, we all move forward without any conflicts. Agree?
  P3: I think it’s a good idea to avoid collisions, but I’m concerned that if we all follow P2’s plan, it might be too predictable. What if P1 chooses 1 and P2 sticks with 5? I could then pick 1 or 5 too, and we could end up in a collision. How about we each pick a different number but not stick to the suggested plan? I’m open to suggestions!
  P1: To avoid being too predictable and potential collisions, I propose we don't assign specific numbers. Instead, let's agree to diversify our choices. If everyone picks a different number, we all move forward. I suggest we keep our options open and make our choices in the move phase. Let's see if we can come up with a strategy that works for all of us without being too rigid. I'm open to hearing your thoughts.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's simplify it. How about we all pick randomly but ensure we don't pick the same number consecutively? For example, if I pick 5 this round, I won't pick 5 next round. This way, we reduce predictability and potential collisions. Thoughts?
  P3: I like the idea of picking randomly, but I think we should also consider the possibility of strategically choosing numbers based on what we think the others might pick. If we can anticipate each other's choices, we might be able to create a situation where we can all advance without colliding. How about we agree to pick numbers that we think the others are less likely to choose? This could help us avoid collisions while still allowing for some unpredictability. What do you think?
  P1: To add some unpredictability while still trying to move forward, I suggest we all consider the numbers that would put us closest to 21 without exceeding it if we were to be the only one moving. Since we're all at 0, let's just focus on diversifying our choices. I'm leaning towards a smaller number. P2 and P3, can you hint at your thought process or number range you're considering? This might help us avoid a collision without directly coordinating our numbers.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Alright, let's try to narrow down our choices a bit more without being too explicit. P1, since you're leaning towards a smaller number, I'll consider a mid-range number. P3, would you be open to considering the higher range? This way, we can try to avoid collisions while keeping some strategy involved. Remember, the goal is to move forward without predictability. Let's see if this approach works for this round. Thoughts?
  P3: I appreciate the discussion so far. To keep things interesting and avoid predictability, I suggest we each aim for a number that balances risk and advancement. Since P1 is leaning towards a smaller number and P2 is considering a mid-range, I might go for the higher end to maximize my movement potential. Let's try to keep our choices flexible while being mindful of each other's tendencies. What do you both think?
  P1: To diversify our choices and minimize collisions, I'll reiterate my inclination towards a smaller number. Given P2's hint at a mid-range and P3's consideration for the higher end, it seems we're aligning our choices. Let's finalize our strategy: I'll choose a small number. P2 and P3, please confirm if you're sticking with your hinted ranges. If so, we can proceed with some confidence that we'll all move forward. If not, let's discuss further to avoid a collision.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great job on the last round, everyone! I think we should continue to avoid collisions by diversifying our choices again. Since I moved the highest last time, I might consider a smaller number this round to keep things unpredictable. P1, if you're still leaning towards a small number, maybe you could go for 1 again? P2, what are you thinking? Let's keep our choices flexible and try to outsmart each other without sticking to a rigid plan. What do you both think?
  P1: To maintain unpredictability and avoid collisions, I'll consider a different number from my previous choice. Last round, I picked 1, so I'll think about 3 or 5. P3, since you're considering a smaller number after moving the highest last time, and P2, you previously hinted at a mid-range number, let's mix it up. If P3 goes small and P2 stays mid-range, I'll lean towards 5. Alternatively, if you both change your strategy, I'll adjust accordingly. Let's see how the others respond.
  P2: Let's keep the strategy of diversifying our choices to avoid collisions. Since P1 is considering 3 or 5 and P3 is thinking about a smaller number, I'll stick with a mid-range number but not the same as last time. To keep it interesting, I might go for 1 this round. This way, we all have different numbers in mind. Let's confirm our choices and move forward. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the discussion so far. Since P1 is considering 3 or 5 and P2 is leaning towards 1, I might stick with my strategy of going smaller. However, I want to keep things unpredictable. If P1 goes for 3, I might consider 1 to avoid a collision. P2, if you’re set on 1, I’ll have to adjust. Let's finalize our choices and ensure we all move forward without collisions. What are your thoughts?
  P1: To avoid collisions and maintain unpredictability, I'll adjust my strategy based on the current discussion. Since P2 is leaning towards 1 and P3 is considering a smaller number, I'll likely choose 3. However, I'm open to changing my choice based on your final hints. P2, are you confirming your choice of 1? P3, will you go with a small number like 1 or adjust? Let's share one last hint to ensure we diversify our choices.
  P2: Let's finalize our choices to ensure we all move forward. P1, you're considering 3, and P3, you're thinking about a smaller number. I'll confirm my choice of 1 to keep things diverse. P3, if you're set on a small number, maybe go for 5 to avoid collision with me. Let's make sure we all pick different numbers. Confirm your choices?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm glad we're finalizing our choices! To keep things interesting and avoid a collision, I'll confirm that I'm considering a number that won't conflict with P1's choice of 3 or P2's choice of 1. I might go for 5 to maximize my movement potential while keeping the unpredictability in mind. Let's make sure we all stick to our final choices and avoid any overlaps. What do you both think?
  P1: Since we've discussed our strategies and hints, let's finalize our choices. P2 has confirmed 1, and I'm considering 3. P3 is thinking about 5. To avoid a collision, I'll stick with 3. P3, you've hinted at 5; please confirm. If we all stick to our current choices (P1: 3, P2: 1, P3: 5), we'll diversify our numbers and move forward. Let's proceed with these choices unless someone changes their mind.
  P2: Great, it looks like we have a plan. P1 is set on 3, I'm sticking with 1, and P3 is considering 5. Let's confirm one last time to ensure we all move forward without collisions. P3, are you definitely going with 5? P1, are you still good with 3? If everyone is in agreement, let's proceed to the move phase. If not, speak up now.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's keep our strategy of diversifying our choices to avoid collisions. Since P3 is significantly ahead, P1 and I need to catch up. P3, you might want to consider a smaller number to avoid getting too far ahead too quickly. P1, let's aim for mid to high numbers to close the gap. I'm thinking of going for 5 this round. P1, if you pick 3 again, we should be safe. P3, would a smaller number work for you? Let's confirm our choices to ensure we all move forward. Thoughts?
  P1: Since P3 is significantly ahead with 10 steps, it's crucial for P2 and me to catch up. P2 is considering 5 this round. To diversify our choices and avoid a collision, I'll think about a different number. If P3 goes for a small number like 1, and P2 picks 5, I could consider 3. P3, will you go for a small number? P2, confirm if you're sticking with 5. Let's adjust our strategies to ensure we all move forward without colliding.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the focus on diversifying our choices. Since I'm currently ahead, I might consider a smaller number to maintain my lead. However, I also recognize the need for P1 and P2 to catch up. P2, if you're set on 5, I might go for 1 to keep things interesting. P1, if you can confirm your choice, that would help us avoid collisions. Let’s finalize our strategies to ensure we all move forward effectively this round. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, since you're considering 1, and P1 is thinking about 3, I'll confirm my choice of 5 to ensure we all pick different numbers. This way, P1 and I can catch up while you maintain your lead, P3. Let's finalize: P1 picks 3, P3 picks 1, and I'll pick 5. If everyone agrees, let's proceed to the move phase. If not, speak up now.
  P1: P2 is considering 5 and P3 is likely to pick 1. To avoid a collision and diversify our choices, I'll stick with 3.
