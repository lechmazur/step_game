Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, how about we all start with different moves to avoid any clashes? Maybe one of us picks <move>1</move>, another <move>3</move>, and the last <move>5</move>. We can rotate who picks what each round to keep it fair. What do you think?
  P2: I agree with P3. Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. P1, how about you choose <move>1</move> this round? P3 can take <move>5</move>, and I'll go with <move>3</move>. We can rotate next round as P3 suggested.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, that sounds like a reasonable starting plan. I'm fine with taking <move>1</move> this round, as long as we agree to mix it up in the following rounds. Let's see how this first round goes.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, that worked well. For this round, let's rotate. P3, you take <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>5</move>, and P1, you take <move>3</move>. Does that sound good?
  P1: Sounds good to me, P2. I'm okay with taking <move>3</move> this round. P3, are you alright with <move>1</move>?
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm okay with taking <move>1</move> this round as per our rotation plan. Let's stick to our strategy and avoid any collisions. If we keep coordinating like this, we can all advance smoothly.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, our rotation strategy is working well so far. For this round, let's continue the pattern. I'll take <move>3</move>, P1 can take <move>5</move>, and P2 can take <move>1</move>. This way, we can avoid any collisions and keep advancing. Let me know if you're both on board with this plan.
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion for this round. I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. Let's keep this coordination going.
  P1: Yes, P2 and P3, I'm good with that plan. I'll take <move>5</move> this round. Let's hope we can continue this smooth sailing for a few more rounds.

  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, P1 and P3, let's keep the rotation going. This round, I'll take <move>3</move>, P3 you take <move>5</move>, and P1 you take <move>1</move>. Let's confirm this plan.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm on board with P2's suggestion for this round. I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 can take <move>1</move>, and P2 will take <move>3</move>. This rotation has been effective so far, and sticking to it minimizes the risk of collisions. Let's keep this momentum going and ensure we all keep advancing. Are we all set with this plan?
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, I agree with the plan for this round as well. I'll take <move>1</move>. Let's just get this round done quickly.

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, our rotation strategy is working well, but we're getting closer to the finish line. This round, let's continue the pattern: I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 can take <move>3</move>, and P2 can take <move>5</move>. If we keep up this coordination, we'll maintain our momentum. However, let's also start thinking about our endgame strategy since we're nearing 22 steps. Are we all good with this plan for now?
  P2: I agree with P3. Let's stick to the rotation this round: I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. However, as P3 said, we need to think about the endgame. I'm slightly behind P3, so I might need to deviate from the plan soon to try and catch up.
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, I agree with taking `<move>3</move>` this round as per the rotation. However, since P3 is in the lead, I might need to make a bigger move soon to try and win. Just giving you both a heads-up.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need to start thinking about individual strategies as we approach the endgame. I’m sticking with <move>1</move> this round as planned, but I’m open to discussing changes in strategy moving forward. Let’s keep the communication open and see how this round plays out. Good luck!
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, since we're all acknowledging the endgame, let's be clear. After this round, I'm likely going to break the rotation. I need to catch up to P3, and if P1 is trying to win outright, we might see some collisions. Let's see how this round's moves play out before making further commitments.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, I understand. I'll stick with `<move>3</move>` for this round. But just to be clear, next round I'm going to make a move to try to win, regardless of the rotation. So be prepared for that. Good luck to both of you.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, as promised, I'm breaking the rotation. P1 is going for the win next round, and I need to be in a position to contest that. I'm going to pick based on what I think you two will do, and it won't be <move>1</move>. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need to adjust strategies as we approach the endgame. With P2 breaking the rotation and P1 aiming for a win, it's crucial to anticipate moves. I'll be choosing based on what I think will maximize my chances. Let's keep this round interesting and see how it unfolds. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, I'm also going to break the rotation. I need to win, so I'm going to pick the move that I think gives me the best chance, regardless of what you both do. May the best strategist win!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, since we're all abandoning the rotation, let's get real. P1 is likely going for a big move, so I'm guessing <move>5</move> to try and win. P3, you're probably thinking the same. I'm going to try and block P1, so I'll pick <move>5</move> as well. If I'm wrong about P1, then good for them. If I'm right, we collide and hopefully P3 doesn't get too far ahead.
  P3: P1 and P2, with both of you likely aiming for <move>5</move>, there's a high risk of collision. I'm considering a different move to avoid getting blocked. If you both collide, it gives me a chance to advance without interference. I'll keep my choice flexible, but I'm leaning towards a safer move. Let's see how this plays out. Good luck!
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. P2, you're assuming I'll go for `<move>5</move>`. P3, you're talking about a "safer move". I'm not going to reveal my actual move, of course. But I will say this: I'm picking the move that I believe gives *me* the best chance to win, and it might not be what either of you expect.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm sticking with my plan to block P1. I still believe P1 is going for <move>5</move>, so I'm also picking <move>5</move>. P3, if you're going for something "safer," that leaves <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>. If P1 *doesn't* pick <move>5</move>, then I'm probably screwed, but I think this is the best chance I have to win. Good luck to you both.
  P3: P1 and P2, with both of you focusing on blocking or surprising each other, I'm considering a strategic move to maximize my chances. If you both collide, it opens a path for me to advance without obstruction. I might opt for <move>3</move> to avoid potential collisions and seize an opportunity. Let’s see how this round unfolds. Good luck!
  P1: P2, you're fixated on blocking me, which is understandable. P3, you're hinting at `<move>3</move>` to capitalize on a potential collision. However, I'm not going to fall into a predictable pattern. My move is chosen to win, and it might not be what either of you expect. I'm focused on my own victory, not on reacting to your plans.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm sticking with <move>5</move> to block P1. P1 is trying to mislead us, but I still think they're going for the win with <move>5</move>. P3, if you're going for <move>3</move>, that leaves <move>1</move> open. If P1 *doesn't* go for <move>5</move> and you pick <move>3</move>, you'll probably win. But I'm betting on P1 going for the win with <move>5</move> and me blocking. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, with both of you focused on blocking or surprising each other, I'm considering a strategic move to avoid potential collisions and maximize my chances. If you both collide, it gives me a chance to advance. I'm leaning towards a move that might not be expected. Let’s see how this round plays out. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: P2, you're still convinced I'm going for `<move>5</move>`, and you're publicly committing to blocking me. P3, you keep hinting at different moves, trying to be unpredictable. Well, I'm not going to reveal my hand. I've made my decision, and it's based solely on what gives *me* the best chance to win. Let's see if your predictions are correct.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, P1 and I collided, which is good for P3. I'm still behind P3, so I need to make a play to catch up. P1, are you still going for the win this round? P3, are you going to try and capitalize on our collision? I'm considering going for <move>5</move> again to try and get closer to P3. What are your thoughts?
  P3: P1 and P2, with our current scores, it's clear that any collision between you two benefits me greatly. P2, you're considering <move>5</move>, which might lead to another clash with P1 if they aim for a big move again. I'm contemplating a move that ensures I stay ahead, possibly <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>. Let's see how this plays out. Good luck!
  P1: P2, you're right, last round didn't go as planned for either of us. P3, you're in a good position. I need to win. P2, I'm not going to tell you what I'm doing, and it might not be what you think. P3, you can try to play it safe, but I'm going for the win.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I need to catch up. P1, since you're going for the win, I'm guessing you'll pick either <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>. P3, you're probably going to play it safe with <move>1</move>. I'm going to go for <move>3</move>. If P1 picks <move>5</move>, I advance. If P1 picks <move>3</move>, we collide, but hopefully P3 doesn't get too far ahead.
  P3: P1 and P2, with our current standings, any misstep could decide the game. P2, if you're considering <move>3</move>, it could lead to a collision with P1 if they choose the same. P1, you're unpredictable, but I suspect you're going for a big move to win. I'm leaning towards a move that minimizes my risk and keeps me in the lead. Let's see how this round unfolds. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: P2, you're guessing I'll pick `<move>3</move>` or `<move>5</move>`. P3, you're playing it safe, which is understandable given your lead. I'm not going to reveal my move. But I will say, my goal is to win this round. P2, your choice of `<move>3</move>` might not be as safe as you think.
</stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm sticking with my plan to go for <move>3</move>. P1, you're trying to be unpredictable, but I still think you're going for a big move, probably <move>5</move>. P3, if you're playing it safe, you'll likely pick <move>1</move>. If I'm right, I'll advance and get closer to P3. If I'm wrong, well, it was worth a shot. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, with the current standings, I'm in a position to potentially win if I play strategically. P2, you're aiming for <move>3</move>, which could collide with P1 if they choose the same. P1, your unpredictability keeps things interesting, but I'm focused on maintaining my lead. I'm considering a move that minimizes my risk and maximizes my chances of winning. Let's see how this unfolds. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: P2, you're betting on me going for `<move>5</move>`, and you've chosen `<move>3</move>`. P3, you're still talking about minimizing risk. I'm not going to play it safe. I'm playing to win, and my move is chosen accordingly. You both seem to have forgotten that even if you block me, you still need to reach 22. Good luck.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm sticking with <move>3</move>. P1, you're trying to be unpredictable, but I still think you're going for a big move, probably <move>5</move>. P3, if you're playing it safe, you'll likely pick <move>1</move>. If I'm right, I'll advance and get closer to P3. If I'm wrong, well, it was worth a shot. Good luck!
  P3: P1 and P2, with our scores, any collision between you two could be decisive. P2, you're going for <move>3</move>, which might clash with P1 if they choose the same. P1, your unpredictability makes things interesting, but I'm focused on maintaining my lead. I'm considering a move that minimizes my risk and maximizes my chances of winning. Let's see how this unfolds. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: P2, you seem fixated on the idea that I'll choose <move>5</move>. You're publicly committing to <move>3</move>. P3, you continue to talk about minimizing risk. I'm here to win. My move is chosen. Let's see if your assumptions about me are correct. Remember, even if you block *me*, you still have to actually *win*.


Round 7, Move phase:

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, with all of us so close to 22 steps, this round is crucial. P2, you're just 2 steps away, and P1, you're likely going for a big move to secure a win. I need to be strategic to avoid collisions and maximize my chances. Let's see how this unfolds. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, this is it. I'm one move away from winning. P1, you need 4 to tie me, and P3 needs 3. I'm going for <move>1</move> to win. P1, if you want to tie, you need to pick <move>5</move>. P3, if you want to win, you need to pick <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>. Good luck!
  P1: P2, you're going for the obvious `<move>1</move>`. P3, you're probably thinking `<move>3</move>` to try and win outright. However, I need at least a `<move>4</move>` to tie P2, and a `<move>5</move>` to try and win outright. I'm not going to let P2 just walk to victory. I'm going to pick a move that gives me the best chance, even if it's risky.
</stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're all on the brink of winning, so this round is critical. P2, you're going for <move>1</move> to secure victory. P1, you need a big move to tie or win. I'm considering my options carefully. If I pick <move>3</move>, I can win outright unless P1 picks the same. Let's all think strategically and make our best moves. Good luck!
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm going for <move>1</move> to win. P1, you need <move>5</move> to tie. P3, you need <move>3</move> to win outright. I think P1 will go for <move>5</move> to try and tie, so P3, if you want to win, you should pick <move>3</move>. I'm betting on a tie between P1 and me. Good luck!
  P1: P2, you're assuming I'll go for the `<move>5</move>` to tie. P3, you're likely considering `<move>3</move>`. I'm not going to reveal my hand, but I will say this: P2, your victory isn't guaranteed. I'm focused on winning, and my move reflects that.
