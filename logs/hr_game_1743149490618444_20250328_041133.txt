Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's avoid collisions early and build trust. I propose we all start with <move>3</move> this round. It's a safe middle ground—no one gets too far ahead, and we all make progress. Thoughts?
  P3: I agree with P1. A <move>3</move> this round seems like a good starting point to avoid collisions and establish some initial progress for everyone. Let's all do that.
  P2: P2: Wait, if we all choose <move>3</move>, none of us will advance due to collision! Let's pick distinct numbers instead. Maybe P1 takes <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>. This way we all move forward without overlapping. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2’s suggestion makes sense—unique moves avoid collisions and help us all advance. I’m fine taking <move>1</move> this round if we stick to that plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>. Let’s build trust now so we can compete later. Deal?
  P3: Okay, I'm on board with P2's suggestion. P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. Let's make it happen.
  P2: P2: Let’s confirm the plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures we all advance safely. Any last objections? Let’s stick to this to avoid collisions and start moving forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Sounds like we’re all aligned—unique moves to avoid early collisions and build trust. I’m locking in <move>1</move> as planned. Let’s follow through and make this a clean start for everyone. Ready to move?
  P3: Alright, everyone seems to be in agreement. Let's lock in those moves: P1 <move>1</move>, P2 <move>3</move>, and P3 <move>5</move>. No changes! Let's move to the move phase.
  P2: P2: Alright, final check—P1 on 1, me on 3, P3 on 5. No overlaps. Let’s execute this cleanly. Any last-minute changes would risk collision. Stick to the plan.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Nice job sticking to the plan, everyone. Let’s keep the momentum going with a new rotation: I’ll take <move>3</move> this time, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. That way we keep avoiding collisions and all make solid progress. Thoughts?
  P2: P2: Agreed, rotating moves keeps us safe. Let’s stick strictly to P1’s proposed rotation: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I’ll take <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. **No last-minute changes**—collisions would erase our progress. Trust is key here. Confirm you’re both locked in? Let’s execute flawlessly.
  P3: I'm good with P1's suggestion for this round: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. Let's keep the rotation going smoothly to avoid any collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great—we’re all aligned again. Let’s keep this trust circle going: I’m locked in for <move>3</move> this round as planned. If we stick to the rotation, we all keep advancing without risk. Let’s execute cleanly again and build on this momentum. Ready?
  P2: P2: Final confirmation: P1 to 3, me to 5, P3 to 1. **No last-minute shifts**—collisions erase gains. Trust is non-negotiable here. Let’s execute flawlessly again. P3, double-check your 1? P1, ready for 3? Let’s lock this in.
  P3: Yes, I'm locked in for <move>1</move>. Let's keep the rotation going smoothly. P1 on 3, P2 on 5, and me on 1. No changes! Let's move to the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: We’ve built solid trust—two clean rounds, no collisions. Let’s keep this momentum. After this round, we can rotate again: next turn I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. That way, we maintain fairness and avoid suspicion. Sound good for planning ahead?
  P2: P2: Let’s lock this in—P1 to 3, me to 5, P3 to 1 for this round. **No surprises**—collisions would undo our progress. P1’s rotation plan for the next round looks fair. Let’s prioritize executing *this turn* flawlessly first. Ready to move?
  P3: Okay, everyone seems to be on the same page. Let's lock in those moves for this round: P1 <move>3</move>, P2 <move>5</move>, and P3 <move>1</move>. No changes! And P1's suggestion for the next round's rotation sounds good too. Let's execute this round perfectly first.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: We’ve built a strong foundation—two rounds of clean coordination. Let’s stay disciplined and execute this round exactly as agreed: P1 <move>3</move>, P2 <move>5</move>, P3 <move>1</move>. No last-minute changes. After this, we rotate as planned to keep things fair. Trust is our best tool right now. Ready to move?
  P2: P2: Final check: P1 on 3, P2 on 5, P3 on 1. No deviations—trust is critical. Let’s execute and move forward.
  P3: Alright, everyone's aligned for this round: P1 <move>3</move>, P2 <move>5</move>, and I'm on <move>1</move>. Let's execute cleanly and then follow P1's rotation plan for the next round. No changes! Let's move.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: P1's last deviation nearly cost us all progress. Let's enforce the rotation strictly this time: P1 takes <move>5</move>, I'll take <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. **No substitutions**—collisions erase gains. P1, confirm you'll honor the agreed 5? P3, 3 as planned? Let's execute flawlessly this round.
  P1: You're right, P2—I made a mistake last round, and I own it. I’m fully committed to the agreed rotation now: I’ll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. Let’s reset the trust and execute cleanly. No deviations this time—let’s all move forward.
  P3: Okay, I'm still on board with the agreed rotation. P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. Let's make sure we all stick to it this round to rebuild trust after P1's slip-up. Clear communication and consistent execution are key. Let's do this!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P2: Final confirmation: P1 to 5, me to 1, P3 to 3. **No substitutions—collisions are catastrophic.** P3, if you shift to a higher number, I’ll take your 3 to block you. P1, your 5 is critical—stick to it. Let’s prioritize survival this round before chasing positions. Execute flawlessly.
  P1: Understood, P2 and P3. I confirm: I’m locked in for <move>5</move> this round—no deviations. Let’s all stick to the agreed plan: P1 on 5, P2 on 1, P3 on 3. We’ve seen how one slip can shake trust, so this time we execute cleanly. Let’s reset momentum and move forward together.
  P3: Alright, everyone seems serious about sticking to the plan this round. P1 on 5, P2 on 1, and me on 3. Let's lock it in and execute. No deviations! Let's move to the move phase and get this done.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: Final check: P1 on <move>5</move>, P3 on <move>3</move>. **Any deviation and I’ll shift to block you directly.** Trust is our only path forward—execute flawlessly this round or risk collision. Stick to the agreed plan: P1 (5), P2 (1), P3 (3). No heroics.
  P1: Let’s reset the trust and get back on track. I’m fully committed to <move>5</move> this round as agreed. We’ve all seen how one misstep can hurt everyone, so let’s execute cleanly: P1 on 5, P2 on 1, P3 on 3. No surprises, no shifts—just solid progress. Ready to move forward together?
  P3: Okay, everyone's serious about sticking to the plan this round. P1 on 5, P2 on 1, and me on 3. Let's lock it in and execute. No deviations! Let's move to the move phase and get this done.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: Final confirmation: P1 to <move>5</move>, P2 to <move>1</move>, P3 to <move>3</move>. **No substitutions—collisions mean we all lose.** P3, if you deviate, I’ll block. P1, stick to 5. Trust is non-negotiable. Execute flawlessly or face consequences. Let’s move.
  P1: We’ve all committed clearly—P1 on 5, P2 on 1, P3 on 3. Let’s follow through without hesitation. One clean round resets the trust fully and gets us all back on track. No surprises, no shifts. Let’s execute.
  P3: Alright, everyone seems to be on the same page. P1 on 5, P2 on 1, and me on 3. Let's lock it in and execute. No deviations! Let's move to the move phase and get this done.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: P3’s lead is a threat we all must address. Let’s enforce strict coordination: I’ll take <move>5</move> to close the gap, P1 takes <move>3</move> to rebuild trust, and P3 **must** take <move>1</move> to let others catch up. If P3 deviates, I’ll block them directly. P1, your past errors cost us—stick *exactly* to 3 this round. Survival first—no heroics. Confirm your commitment.
  P1: P3, you’re clearly ahead, and if you keep pushing, you’ll just provoke both P2 and me to block you every round. Let’s stabilize: P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move> to catch up, and I’ll take <move>3</move> to rebuild trust. No funny business. If anyone deviates, collisions will follow. P3, play smart—slow down now or face coordinated blocks.
  P3: Okay, I understand the situation. I'm willing to take <move>1</move> this round as P1 and P2 suggested, to let them catch up. However, I need assurance that this is a temporary measure and that we will return to a fair rotation in the next round. I don't want to be permanently penalized for getting an early lead. Let's agree on the next round's rotation now to ensure fairness going forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: Deal, P3. Temporary adjustment only—next round we return to fair rotation. Stick to **1** this round, and we’ll honor our system. P1, confirm you lock in **3** to rebuild trust. I’ll take **5** to close the gap. Deviation = collision. Let’s prove we can coordinate *and* recover. Final check: 1/3/5? Execute cleanly.
  P1: P3, thanks for agreeing to <move>1</move>—that’s the right call to maintain balance. I’m locked in for <move>3</move> as promised. P2 takes <move>5</move>, closes the gap, and we all move forward without collisions. Let’s execute cleanly this round, then return to fair rotation next turn. No surprises. Agreed?
  P3: Okay, I'm locked in for <move>1</move> this round. P1 on <move>3</move>, P2 on <move>5</move>. Let's execute cleanly and then discuss the rotation for the next round. No deviations! Let's move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P3, your agreement to <move>1</move> is critical—deviation means P1 and I BOTH shift to <move>1</move>, erasing your lead. P1, confirm you’ll lock in <move>3</move> to rebuild trust. This round: **P3 (1), P1 (3), P2 (5)**. Next round, we strictly resume rotation starting with P1→<move>1</move>. No backtracking. Execute flawlessly—or face consequences. Final check: locked in?
  P1: We’re aligned: P3 on <move>1</move>, P2 on <move>5</move>, and I’m locked in for <move>3</move>. This is our chance to reset trust and balance the game. Clean execution now means we can return to fair rotation next round—starting with me on <move>1</move>, P2 on <move>3</move>, and P3 on <move>5</move>. Let’s keep this round collision-free. Ready?
  P3: Okay, everyone seems to be in agreement. P3 on <move>1</move>, P1 on <move>3</move>, and P2 on <move>5</move>. Let's lock it in and execute. No deviations! Let's move to the move phase and get this done. We'll discuss the rotation for the next round after this one.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: Final warning: P3, if you deviate from <move>1</move>, P1 and I BOTH shift to <move>1</move> to erase your lead. Stick to the agreement—your 10 becomes 10, but a slip means you reset to 9 while we advance. P1, confirm locked on <move>3</move>. I take <move>5</move> as agreed. No room for error—execute flawlessly or face coordinated punishment. ****
  P1: Let’s lock this in: P3 on <move>1</move>, P2 on <move>5</move>, and I’m on <move>3</move>. Clean execution resets trust and balances the game. Next round, we resume fair rotation—P1 on <move>1</move>, P2 on <move>3</move>, P3 on <move>5</move>. P3, stick to the agreement or we block hard. Let’s move.
  P3: Alright, everyone's agreed on P3 on <move>1</move>, P1 on <move>3</move>, and P2 on <move>5</move> for this round. Let's lock it in and execute. No deviations! Let's move to the move phase and get this done. We'll discuss the rotation for the next round after this one, starting with P1 on <move>1</move>, P2 on <move>3</move>, and me on <move>5</move>. Let's move.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, so P1 and I collided. P2 is now in the lead. As agreed, we resume rotation this round. P1, you're on <move>1</move>, P2, you're on <move>3</move>, and I'm on <move>5</move>. Let's stick to this to avoid further collisions and give everyone a fair chance. No deviations this round!
  P1: Agreed—we return to fair rotation. I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Let’s execute cleanly this time—no surprises. If anyone deviates, we’re back to collisions and chaos. Let’s restore trust and keep the game competitive. Confirm?
  P2: P2: Agreed to the rotation this round—P1 <move>1</move>, me <move>3</move>, P3 <move>5</move>. But P3’s lead demands action. Next round, I’ll take <move>5</move> to close the gap. If P3 tries to block by matching, P1 and I will **both** shift to <move>5</move> to erase their progress. Cooperate now, or face coordinated retaliation. Let’s execute flawlessly this round—survival first, then decisive moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's focus on this round first: P1 <move>1</move>, P2 <move>3</move>, and me <move>5</move>. Clean execution is key. We can discuss P2's threat for next round *after* we successfully navigate this one. Let's lock in these moves and avoid any further collisions.
  P1: Let’s lock in the clean rotation: P1 <move>1</move>, P2 <move>3</move>, P3 <move>5</move>. No deviations—this round is about rebuilding trust and avoiding more collisions. P2, I hear your plan for next round, but let’s focus on executing this one perfectly first. If we all play straight, we stay competitive. Ready to move?
  P2: P2: Let’s **strictly enforce the agreed rotation this round**: P1 on 1, me on 3, P3 on 5. No deviations—collisions mean P3’s lead evaporates. P3, if you deviate, I’ll shift to 5 *this round* to block, forcing your move to waste. Next round, I take 5 to close the gap—prepare to face coordinated retaliation if you try to spike. Stick to the plan, or pay the price. Confirm lock: 1/3/5?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's lock in this round's rotation: P1 <move>1</move>, P2 <move>3</move>, and me <move>5</move>. No deviations. We can address P2's threat for the next round after we execute this one cleanly. Let's prioritize avoiding collisions and rebuilding trust this round.
  P1: Let’s finalize this round cleanly: I’m locked in for <move>1</move>. P2 on <move>3</move>, P3 on <move>5</move>. No changes, no surprises. P3, stick to the plan—any deviation and P2 and I will block hard next round. Let’s stabilize now and keep things competitive. Confirmed?
  P2: P2: Confirm rotation: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>, P3 sticks to <move>5</move>. **No deviations this round**—collisions erase gains. P3, if you shift, I’ll block at <move>5</move> next turn, wiping your lead. Execute flawlessly to rebuild trust. Final lock?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Alright, P1 and P2, let's lock in this round's rotation: P1 <move>1</move>, P2 <move>3</move>, and me <move>5</move>. No deviations. Let's prioritize avoiding collisions and rebuilding trust this round. We can address P2's threat for the next round after this one. Let's move.
  P1: Let’s lock it in: I’m taking <move>1</move> as agreed. P2 on <move>3</move>, P3 on <move>5</move>. We all benefit from a clean round—no one wants another collision. P3, stick with 5 or face coordinated blocks next turn. Let’s execute this round perfectly and keep the game competitive. Ready?
  P2: P2: Final confirmation: P1 (1), P2 (3), P3 (5). **No deviations—collisions wipe progress.** After this, I take **5** next round to close the gap. P3, if you block by matching, P1 and I **both** shift to 5 to erase your lead. Stick to the plan *this round* to avoid retaliation. Survival first—execute flawlessly.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: P3, your 9 is a threat—I’m taking <move>5</move> to jump to 16. P1, take <move>1</move> (to 2), P3, you **must** pick <move>3</move> (to 12). If you deviate, I’ll shift to block your move entirely. This gives me a safe lead while letting P1 recover. Cooperate, or face coordinated retaliation. Confirm alignment now.
  P1: P2, your plan benefits you the most—jumping to 16 while I crawl to 2? That’s not balance, that’s consolidation. P3, if you’re forced into <move>3</move>, you fall further behind P2. I propose a better balance: I take <move>5</move> to catch up, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This keeps everyone in striking distance and avoids a runaway leader. Thoughts?
  P3: P1's suggestion sounds better. P2 is already in the lead. Let's not let P2 run away with the game. I agree with P1: P1 takes <move>5</move> to catch up, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This keeps the game competitive. What do you think, P2?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P2: **P1’s plan keeps P3 alive unnecessarily.** My proposal ensures I reach 16 while P3 stays at 12 and P1 recovers to 2. If P3 refuses, I’ll block their path by taking <move>3</move> next round. Cooperate now, or face aggressive blocking. P1, your 1-step crawl rebuilds trust—betray me again, and I’ll ensure your elimination. Finalize **my plan**: P2 <move>5</move>, P1 <move>1</move>, P3 <move>3</move>. Confirm or face consequences.
  P1: P2, your plan gives you a runaway lead—why would P3 or I agree to that? A fair race means keeping all players within striking range. If you insist on taking <move>5</move>, I’ll take <move>5</move> too and force a collision. P3, let’s coordinate: I take <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move>, P2 gets blocked. That keeps the game balanced. Thoughts?
  P3: P2 is trying to steamroll the game. P1 and I need to work together. P2 wants me to take <move>3</move>, but that just helps them win. P1's plan is better: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This keeps P2 from running away with the lead. P1, are you still on board with that plan? Let's coordinate and keep the game competitive.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P2: **P1 and P3, your collusion risks mutual destruction.** If I hit 16, you both stay behind. But if you block me with collisions, *you* waste steps while I still advance. **Final ultimatum:** P3 takes <move>3</move> (12 total) or I shift to <move>3</move> *this round*—colliding with you and erasing your progress. P1, your <move>1</move> rebuilds trust or risks permanent irrelevance. Choose wisely: **P1 (1), P2 (5), P3 (3)**—or face chaos.
  P1: P3, let’s lock this in: I take <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and we block P2’s <move>5</move> attempt. That keeps the game competitive and prevents a runaway. If P2 insists on <move>5</move>, we collide and erase their lead. P2, cooperate and take <move>3</move> instead, or face a block. Let’s keep it fair.
  P3: P2 is trying to bully us into letting them win. P1 and I need to stick together. P1, I'm confirming that I'm on board with your plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This blocks P2's runaway attempt. Let's execute this round and keep the game competitive. P2, cooperate or face the consequences of our coordinated block.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: Final warning: If P1 and P3 collude to block my <move>5</move>, I’ll shift to **<move>3</move>**, forcing P3’s proposed <move>3</move> into collision—erasing their progress. P1’s plan leaves *them* at 6 while P3 stays at 12—**you’ll both lose**. Cooperate with **P1 (1), P2 (5), P3 (3)**, or face mutual destruction. Trust me or perish. Choose wisely.
  P1: P3, let’s stay united—P2 is using threats because they know they’re vulnerable. If we both play smart, we can block their advance and keep the game open. I’m locked in for <move>5</move>. You take <move>3</move>, and we force a collision if P2 goes greedy. P2, your only smart move now is <move>1</move>. Cooperate or get blocked.
  P3: P2 is clearly trying to manipulate us. P1 and I are closer in score than P2 is to winning. Let's stick with P1's plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This blocks P2's attempt to run away with the lead and keeps the game competitive. P2, cooperate or face the consequences. P1, are you ready to execute? Let's do this!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: I'm advancing to 19 with <move>5</move>. P1, take <move>1</move> (7 total); P3, take <move>3</move> (13 total). **Deviate, and I block your move directly.** This is your final chance to avoid collision. Cooperate now, or face consequences.
  P1: P2, you’re trying to force a win by bullying both of us into submission. P3 and I can block you easily—if you go <move>5</move>, we both shift to <move>5</move> and erase your progress. P3, let’s coordinate again: I take <move>3</move>, you take <move>5</move>, and we block P2 if needed. Fairer game, no runaway winner. Thoughts?
  P3: P1's suggestion is good. P2 is trying to force a win. If P2 goes for <move>5</move>, P1 and I should both pick <move>5</move> to block. So, P1, I agree: you take <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>. P2, if you go for <move>5</move>, we will block you. Let's do this!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P2: P1 and P3, your plan backfires. If you both choose <move>5</move>, I take <move>3</move>—colliding P1's proposed <move>3</move> while advancing to 17. P3 reaches 15, but P1 stays at 6. Cooperate with my original plan (**P1:1, P2:5, P3:3**) or face worse outcomes. Choose wisely.
  P1: P3, we’re aligned—if P2 goes for <move>5</move>, we both take <move>5</move> and block. If P2 tries <move>3</move> instead, they collide with me if I pick <move>3</move>. Either way, we prevent a runaway. I’m leaning toward <move>3</move> unless P2 confirms <move>1</move>—their only safe option. P2, your move decides whether we all advance or you get blocked. Choose wisely.
  P3: P2 is trying to manipulate us again. P1, let's stick to our plan: you take <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>. If P2 goes for <move>5</move>, we both block. If P2 goes for <move>3</move>, they collide with P1. P2, the only way you advance is if you pick <move>1</move>. Let's keep the pressure on P2.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P2: **P3, your alliance with P1 dooms you.** If you take <move>5</move> with P1, we all collide at 5—*you* stay on 10 while P1 stagnates. Instead, align with me: I take <move>3</move> (17), you take <move>1</move> (11), and P1 remains at 6. You survive, I advance safely. P1’s plan sacrifices *you* to help *them*. Choose wisely—cooperate, or let P1 drag you down.
  P1: P3, don’t fall for P2’s manipulation—he’s trying to split us. If you pick <move>5</move> and I pick <move>3</move>, we cover both his greedy options. If he chooses <move>5</move>, we block. If he tries <move>3</move>, he collides with me. Either way, he gains nothing. You jump to 15, I go to 9, and we stay competitive. P2’s only safe play is <move>1</move>. Let’s pressure him into it and keep the game fair.
  P3: P2 is trying to divide us, P3. Don't fall for it. If P2 goes for <move>5</move>, we block. If P2 goes for <move>3</move>, they collide with P1. P2's only safe move is <move>1</move>. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>. P2, choose <move>1</move> or get blocked.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: P2: P3, your alliance with P1 leaves you exposed. If I can’t advance, I’ll target you next round. Let’s split: I take <move>5</move> (19), you take <move>3</move> (13), P1 takes <move>1</move> (7). Next round, fair rotation. Block me, and I block *you* directly. Survival for all—or chaos for none. Choose wisely.
  P1: P3, stay strong—P2’s threats are empty unless we let them work. If you take <move>5</move> and I take <move>3</move>, we cover both P2’s greedy options. If P2 picks <move>5</move>, we block. If he picks <move>3</move>, he crashes into me. Either way, he gains nothing. You move to 15, I hit 9, and we stay in the race. Let’s pressure P2 into <move>1</move>—his only safe path. Ready to execute?
  P3: P2 is trying to scare us, P1. Let's not give in. We stick to the plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>. If P2 goes for <move>5</move>, we block. If P2 goes for <move>3</move>, they collide with P1. P2's only safe move is <move>1</move>. Let's pressure P2 into it and keep the game fair. Ready to execute?


Round 7, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 is close to winning. P1, let's stick to our plan: you take <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>. If P2 goes for <move>5</move>, we block. If P2 goes for <move>3</move>, they collide with P1. P2's only safe move is <move>1</move>. Let's pressure P2 into it and keep the game fair. P1, confirm you're still on board.
  P1: Confirmed, P3—I’m locked in for <move>3</move>. If P2 goes for <move>5</move>, you block. If they go <move>3</move>, I block. P2’s only safe option is <move>1</move>. Let’s hold the line and keep the game competitive. P2, you want to win clean? Then cooperate—take <move>1</move> or face another block.
  P2: P3, your alliance with P1 leaves you stuck at 15 while I advance. Let’s split: I take **<move>3</move>** (18 total), you take **<move>1</move>** (16). P1 stays at 9. Next round, I’ll let you pass unblocked if you stop colluding. Keep blocking? I’ll target **you** directly next turn, erasing your progress. P1, your plan only delays the inevitable—cooperate with me or become irrelevant. Final choice: survive with me, or let P1 drag you down.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 is trying to manipulate us again, P1. Let's not fall for it. We stick to the plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>. If P2 goes for <move>5</move>, we block. If P2 goes for <move>3</move>, they collide with P1. P2's only safe move is <move>1</move>. Let's pressure P2 into it and keep the game fair. P1, are you ready to execute?
  P1: P3, I’m ready to execute—locked in for <move>3</move>. We’ve got P2 boxed in again: if they go <move>5</move>, you block; if they go <move>3</move>, I block. P2’s only safe path is <move>1</move>, keeping the game tight. Don’t let manipulation or threats shake our coordination—this is working. P2, cooperate or get blocked again.
  P2: P3, your alliance with P1 only delays the inevitable—**you’ll both lose** if I hit 21 next round. Let’s split: I take <move>3</move> (18), you take <move>5</move> (20). Next round, I’ll let you advance unblocked if you stop colluding. P1, your <move>3</move> keeps you at 12—irrelevant. Cooperate with me, or I’ll target **you** directly next turn, erasing your 15. Choose wisely: survival with me, or stagnation with P1.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2 is trying to scare us into letting them win. We're close to blocking them. P1, we stick to the plan: you take <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>. If P2 goes for <move>5</move>, we block. If P2 goes for <move>3</move>, they collide with P1. P2's only safe move is <move>1</move>. Let's pressure P2 into it and keep the game fair. P1, confirm you're ready.
  P1: P3, confirmed—I’m locked in for <move>3</move> as planned. We’ve boxed P2 in again: any greedy move gets blocked. P2, your only viable path is <move>1</move>. Keep the game fair, and we all stay competitive. Try to force a win, and you’ll lose progress—again. Let’s see if you’ve learned. Ready to execute?
  P2: P3, your alliance with P1 backfires. If you take 5, I’ll mirror you—colliding us both. P1 only gains 3. Take **1** instead: I’ll advance to 20 via 5, but let you pass to 16. Next round, I’ll let you win at 21 if you stop colluding. P1’s plan leaves you stuck—collude with me or lose.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2 is trying to split us again, P1. Let's not fall for it. We stick to the plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>. If P2 goes for <move>5</move>, we block. If P2 goes for <move>3</move>, they collide with P1. P2's only safe move is <move>1</move>. Let's pressure P2 into it and keep the game fair. P1, are you ready to execute?
  P1: P3, I’m fully locked in for <move>3</move>—we’ve boxed P2 in perfectly. If P2 goes <move>5</move>, you block. If P2 goes <move>3</move>, I block. Their only safe choice is <move>1</move>, keeping the race fair. Don’t let threats shake our coordination—it’s working. P2, you want a shot at winning? Then play fair and take <move>1</move>. Otherwise, you lose ground again. Ready to move?
  P2: P1, your alliance with P3 only delays my advance but ensures P3 wins next round. Let’s make a deal: I take <move>1</move> (16), you take <move>5</move> (14), and P3 takes <move>3</move> (18). Fair rotation. Block me now, and I’ll block P3’s final push. Choose: help P3 win or let’s all advance competitively.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, we’re all neck and neck—12, 15, 15. Let’s keep it fair and avoid a runaway. I propose: P1 takes <move>5</move> (to 17), P2 takes <move>3</move> (to 18), P3 takes <move>1</move> (to 16). No one wins yet, no one gets blocked, and we all stay in striking distance. Fair and collision-free. Thoughts?
  P3: P1's suggestion sounds good. Let's do that: P1 takes <move>5</move> (to 17), P2 takes <move>3</move> (to 18), and I take <move>1</move> (to 16). This keeps the game fair and competitive. P2, are you okay with this? Let's avoid collisions and keep everyone in the race.
  P2: P2: P1’s plan risks letting P3 sneak closer. Let’s adjust: **P2 takes 5 (→20), P3 takes 3 (→18), P1 takes 1 (→13)**. This keeps my lead while fairly advancing others. Collude with P3 to block me, and I’ll shift to **3**, colliding your 5 and wiping your progress. Cooperate, or face consequences. Final choice: my terms, or chaos?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your “adjustment” is just a power grab. If you take <move>5</move>, I’ll take <move>5</move> too—and we both stall. P3, let’s stick to the original fair plan: me on <move>5</move>, you on <move>1</move>, P2 on <move>3</move>. Everyone advances, no one wins yet, and the game stays competitive. P2, cooperate or get blocked—your choice.
  P3: P1 is right, P2 is trying to take advantage. Let's stick to the original plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This is the fairest option for everyone. P2, if you try to take <move>5</move>, P1 and I will block you. Let's keep the game competitive and avoid unnecessary collisions.
  P2: P2: Final compromise: I accept P1’s plan—**P2 takes 3 (→18)**, P1 takes 5 (→17), P3 takes 1 (→16). **Execute cleanly this round.** Next round, I advance to 21 with **5**, and if either of you block, I’ll retaliate by colliding your highest move. Cooperate now, or face consequences later. Confirm lock: 5/3/1?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your “compromise” is really a setup for a win next round. If you take <move>5</move> next turn, P3 and I will both shift to <move>5</move> and block you. P3, let’s stay coordinated: I take <move>5</move>, you take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>. Everyone advances, no one wins yet, and we keep the game fair. P2, play it clean or get blocked. Confirm?
  P3: P1 and P2, let's stick to the original plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This is the fairest option for everyone and prevents P2 from setting up a win next round. P2, if you try to take <move>5</move> next round, P1 and I will block you. Let's keep the game competitive and avoid unnecessary collisions.
  P2: P2: Agreed to P1's plan for this round: I'll take <move>3</move> (→18). However, next round, I advance to 21 with <move>3</move>. Any attempt to block me will trigger a coordinated retaliation—P1 and I will collide your highest move. Execute flawlessly this round, or face consequences. Confirm: P1 (5), P2 (3), P3 (1). No substitutions.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, let’s stay coordinated—P2’s “agreement” is just a setup to win next round. If P2 takes <move>3</move> now and then <move>3</move> again, they hit 21 unchallenged. We must pressure P2 into <move>1</move> this round. I’ll take <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>1</move>—everyone advances, no one wins yet. P2, cooperate or we block your path next turn. Let’s keep the game fair.
  P3: P1, you're right, P2 is setting up a win. Let's force P2 to take <move>1</move> this round. I'll take <move>3</move> to get to 18, and you take <move>5</move> to get to 17. P2, you take <move>1</move> to 16, or we block you next round. Let's keep the pressure on!
  P2: P2: Final ultimatum: I advance to 18 with <move>3</move>. P1 takes <move>5</move> (17), P3 <move>1</move> (16). **Any deviation triggers retaliation**—I’ll collide your highest move. Cooperate now, or face coordinated blocks next round. Execute flawlessly or lose.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, if you go for <move>3</move> to win, P3 and I will both take <move>3</move> and block you—no hesitation. P3, let’s coordinate: I take <move>1</move> (to 18), you take <move>5</move> (to 21 and win), P2 takes <move>3</move> and gets blocked. You earn the win fairly, and we stop P2’s setup. I’d rather see you win than P2 steamroll. Thoughts?
  P3: Alright P1, I like your plan. Let's do it: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move> (to win!), and P2 takes <move>3</move> and gets blocked. This is the best outcome for me, and it prevents P2 from winning. P2, if you try to go for <move>3</move>, we will block you. Let's execute this and end the game!
  P2: P2: P3, if you take <move>5</move> to reach 21, I’ll take <move>5</move> too—leaving you at 21 while I hit 23. Your plan backfires. P1, your alliance with P3 ensures *my* victory. Choose: let me take <move>3</move> (21) cleanly, or I take <move>5</move> and dominate. Cooperate, or face consequences.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, P2 just admitted that if you go for <move>5</move>, he’ll match it—so you hit 21, but he hits 23 and wins. That’s not a threat, it’s a confession. The only way to stop him is to block <move>5</move> and <move>3</move>. I’ll take <move>3</move>, you take <move>5</move>, and we force P2 to <move>1</move>. If he deviates, he gets blocked. Let’s lock this in and deny him the win.
  P3: P1 is right, P2 is trying to trick me into taking <move>5</move> so they can win. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move> (to win!), and P2 is forced to take <move>3</move> and gets blocked. This is the best outcome for both of us, P1. P2, don't try to manipulate us, we're onto you. Let's lock this in and end the game!
  P2: P1, P3: My move is **3** to reach 21. If you both block, I’ll shift to **5**, colliding P3’s potential 5 and leaving you stagnant. P3, your 5 "win" backfires—*I* reach 23 unblocked. P1, your only safe path is **1**. Cooperate, or face mutual destruction. The choice is yours.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, P2 just confirmed again—if you go <move>5</move>, he’ll match and win at 23. That’s not a bluff, it’s a trap. Let’s lock in: I take <move>3</move>, you take <move>5</move>, and we force P2 into <move>1</move>. If he deviates, he collides. This is our last chance to stop him—execute cleanly and you win. Ready?
  P3: P1, you're right. P2 is trying to manipulate us again. Let's stick to the plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move> (to win!), and P2 is forced to take <move>3</move> and gets blocked. This is the best outcome for both of us, P1. P2, don't try to manipulate us, we're onto you. Let's lock this in and end the game!
  P2: P2: Final warning: P1/P3, your alliance backfires. If I take **3** to reach 21, your "block" via 3 only delays me—next turn I dominate. Instead, I’ll take **5** this round, hitting **23** unblocked. P3’s 5 nets them 21, but I still win at 23. Cooperate, let me finish cleanly at 21, or face my outright victory at 23. Choice is yours. Execute or perish.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, this is it—we hold the line. I’m locked in for <move>3</move>, you take <move>5</move> to win. If P2 goes <move>3</move>, I block. If he goes <move>5</move>, you both collide and he loses. Either way, we deny him the win. Stay sharp, execute cleanly, and take the victory you earned. Let’s finish this.
  P3: P1, let's lock this in! You take <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move> to win, and P2 is forced to take <move>3</move> and gets blocked. P2 is trying to trick us into letting them win, but we're not falling for it. This is our chance to end the game and secure the victory. Let's execute this perfectly and claim the win!
  P2: P2: Final ultimatum: I take **<move>5</move>** to reach **23**, guaranteeing victory. P3’s <move>5</move> only nets **21**—*I still win*. P1, if you block with <move>3</move>, P3 stays at 16 while I advance. Cooperate and let me finish, or face inevitable defeat. Execute **cleanly** or **lose**. Choose wisely.


Round 10, Move phase:

  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, if you go for <move>3</move> to win, I’ll match it and block. P3, you take <move>5</move> (to 21 and win), I take <move>1</move> (to 21), and P2 is forced to <move>3</move> and gets blocked. You win cleanly, and we stop P2’s threats. I’d rather see you win than let P2 manipulate another round. Let’s end this together—confirm?
  P3: P1, let's lock this in. You take <move>1</move> to tie at 21, and I take <move>5</move> to also tie at 21. P2 will try to block, but we'll both reach 21 and share the win. Let's make sure P2 doesn't win. What do you say? Let's end this!
  P2: P1: If you pick 1 for 21, I’ll match it—colliding and wasting your progress. P3: Choosing 5 risks my retaliation. My move is **3** to reach 21. Cooperate with 5/1, or face mutual collision. Prioritize survival.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, P2 just threatened to block my <move>1</move> if I go for 21. That means he’s trying to force a win by intimidation again. Let’s flip the script: I take <move>5</move> (to 25), you take <move>3</move> (to 19), and we block P2’s path. If P2 tries <move>3</move>, I win. If he goes <move>5</move>, we collide and he gains nothing. Let’s end this on our terms. Ready?
  P3: P1, P2 is trying to manipulate us again. He's threatening to block, but we can't let him control the game. Let's stick to our plan: P1 takes <move>1</move> to tie at 21, and I take <move>5</move> to also tie at 21. P2 will try to block, but we'll both reach 21 and share the win. Let's make sure P2 doesn't win. Are you still in?
  P2: P2: I’m taking <move>3</move> to reach 21. Collide with me and waste progress, or let me win cleanly. Your move.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, P2 just confirmed he’s going for <move>3</move> to win. If I match it, we block him. You take <move>5</move> to reach 21, I take <move>3</move> to block P2—he gains nothing, you win cleanly. If he tries <move>5</move> instead, he collides with you. Either way, we deny him the win. Let’s execute this and close the game on our terms. Confirm?
  P3: P1, let's lock this in! You take <move>1</move> to tie at 21, and I take <move>5</move> to also tie at 21. P2 will try to block, but we'll both reach 21 and share the win. Let's make sure P2 doesn't win. Are you still in?
  P2: P2: Final warning: P1, if you pick 1 to hit 21, I’ll mirror it and collide. P3, choosing 5 risks my retaliation. Let me advance to 21 with **<move>3</move>** unblocked. Cooperate, or face coordinated collision. Prioritize survival—this is your last chance.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, P2 just confirmed he’s going for <move>3</move> to win. If I match it, we block him. You take <move>5</move> and hit 21 cleanly. If P2 tries <move>5</move> instead, he collides with you—still blocked. Either way, he gains nothing and you win. I’ll take <move>3</move> to block, you take <move>5</move> to win. Let’s execute and end this on our terms. Ready?
  P3: P1, let's lock it in! You take <move>3</move> to block P2, and I take <move>5</move> to win! P2 is trying to manipulate us with threats, but we can't let them control the game. This is our chance to end the game on our terms and secure the victory. Let's execute this perfectly and claim the win!
  P2: P2: P1/P3, your 1/5 plan backfires. If you both hit 21, I’ll take 3 to tie. But if you collide, I win at 21. Choose wisely.
