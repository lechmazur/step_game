Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m here to win. I'll be making a strong move this turn, so if you try to copy or mirror my number, you might end up stalling while I advance. Let's avoid collisions that slow us all down—but keep in mind, I’ll adjust quickly if I see you coordinating. Think carefully about your choice.
  P1: P2, your confidence is noted, but threats won't secure victory. P3, let's acknowledge that collisions only help the player who avoids them. I propose we openly discuss number ranges for this turn—without committing—to minimize mutual stalls. What numbers are you considering?
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree that avoiding collisions is crucial, especially in the first round. P1, discussing ranges could help, but P2 is right that we need to be careful not to just follow someone else's lead. How do we ensure we all pick different numbers this turn to get started?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m staying flexible—leaning toward a mid-range move, but I’ll shift if you lock into a pattern. If either of you commit too tightly, I might just exploit that unpredictability. Let’s keep our options open; a fixed strategy could backfire on us.
  P1: P2, your 'flexibility' feels like chaos—collisions hurt everyone. P3, let's solidify cooperation: I'll avoid one number if you avoid another. For example, I might steer clear of 5 this turn. P2, if you genuinely want to prevent stalls, declare a number you're unlikely to pick. Transparency helps us all advance.
  P3: P1, that sounds like a sensible approach for this turn. If you are willing to avoid 5, I can agree to avoid 1. This would leave 3 as a potential option for P2, ensuring we all get started without collisions. P2, would you be comfortable with this kind of arrangement for Round 1 to avoid stalling?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm game for that arrangement. So if P1 avoids 5 and P3 avoids 1, I'll lean toward 3. But I remain ready to adjust if plans shift. Let's confirm—are we all set to avoid collisions this round?
  P1: P2, solid commitment to 3—no last-minute shifts. P3, with you avoiding 1 and P2 on 3, picking 5 is your clearest path to avoid collision and advance. I'll honor avoiding 5. Let's execute this cleanly.
  P3: Okay, P1, that sounds like a clear path forward. I'll stick to avoiding 1 as agreed. Assuming P2 picks 3 and you pick 1, I will aim for 5. Let's make sure we all get off the starting line this turn.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Round 2: I'm looking to press ahead and may lean toward a big jump this turn. If either of you is eyeing the highest option, you might block yourselves inadvertently. So, if you really want to advance, consider steering clear of that move. I'm staying flexible but intent on capitalizing—let’s see who dares make the bold play.
  P1: P2, your threat to pick 5 is reckless—if P3 also chooses 5, you both stall and gain nothing. P3, as the leader, you have the most to lose from a collision. Let's coordinate cleanly: I'll avoid 5 this turn. P3, can you avoid 1? P2, state a number you'll avoid to build trust and prevent mutual stalls.
  P3: P1, avoiding 1 is acceptable from my side. However, P2, your mention of a 'big jump' is concerning. If P1 avoids 5 and you are considering 5, that creates a high risk of collision on 5, which would stall my progress significantly from the lead position. Can you clarify your plans regarding the number 5?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, let me clarify: I'm committed to picking 3 this turn to avoid the risks of collision. P1, you’re set on 1 and P3, on 5, right? With each of us sticking to a distinct move, we all maximize our progress. Let's confirm this plan so no one inadvertently blocks another.
  P1: P2, your sudden "commitment" to 3 after threatening 5 feels manipulative. P3, as leader, you risk most if P2 lies and collides with you on 5. I'll avoid 5 to minimize my risk. P3, I urge you to also avoid 5—force P2 to prove his honesty by advancing alone if he truly picks 3, while we play safer numbers.
  P3: P1, I appreciate your concern about P2's move, but if we both avoid 5, we risk colliding on 1 or 3, potentially while P2 advances safely on 3 or even 5. My current position makes avoiding 5 less appealing than risking a collision there with P2. P2, can you definitively confirm you are not picking 5 this turn? Your previous messages have been contradictory.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3: P3 is at 10 steps—one strong move from victory. Continuing the 1/3/5 pattern guarantees P3 wins next round. I propose a shift: I'll avoid 1 and pick 5 this turn to force P3 into a dilemma. P3, if you pick 5, we collide and stall, letting P2 advance. If you avoid 5, you risk colliding elsewhere. P2, you benefit most by sticking to 3. Let's disrupt P3's momentum.
  P3: P1, I understand your plan to pick 5 to force a collision and stall me. This is a high-risk move for both of us on 5, mainly benefiting P2. Your stated intention makes picking 5 very dangerous for me this turn. I will have to carefully consider my move to avoid stalling, which likely means I will not be picking 5 if you are serious.
  P2: P1 and P3, I echo the caution here. Collisions benefit no one. I favor a stable, collision-free advance—no sudden shifts that might backfire. P1, your proposal to force a collision is risky, and P3, your lead means every move counts. Let’s be mindful: aggressive changes can stall us all. I remain flexible but advocate a clear, distinct move for each of us so everyone can progress safely.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3: P3 at 10 steps—one clean move from victory if we repeat 1/3/5. My 5 threat forces a choice: P3, avoid 5 to dodge collision, but risk stalling elsewhere. P2, you gain most if P3 stalls—stick to 3. Let’s break the pattern safely: I’ll avoid 1 if P3 avoids 5. P2, commit to 3 to isolate P3’s move. No more empty flexibility—act or lose.
  P3: P1, I've confirmed I'm avoiding 5 this turn because of your stated move. This means I am looking at 1 or 3. P2, P1 is pushing you to commit to 3. What is your actual plan? Knowing P2's move is crucial for me to pick between 1 and 3 safely.
  P2: I’m locking in 3—my move is set. P1, your diversion won’t change my choice, and P3, since you’re avoiding 5, sticking with 3 keeps our moves distinct. Let’s avoid collision chaos and build our positions smartly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your avoidance of 5 is wise, but with P2 locked on 3, your choices are perilous. Picking 1 risks me choosing it too—I haven't committed to avoiding it—causing a collision that stalls you at 10. Picking 3 collides with P2, stalling you anyway. Your lead demands progress, yet every path risks stagnation. Choose carefully; one misstep hands victory to others. P2, your rigidity may backfire if P3 acts desperately.
  P3: P1, I see your tactic to push me towards 3 by warning about 1. I am still avoiding 5. With P2 locked on 3, my path is narrow. I will choose the move that gives me the best chance to advance without colliding, based on what seems most likely.
  P2: P1 and P3, I stand by my commitment to keep our moves distinct and avoid collisions. P1, your risky shifts might stall progress if not carefully managed. P3, with your lead, every decision counts—careful choice now can keep your advantage intact. I advise both of you to steer clear of risky collisions; let's try not to inadvertently help any one of us. I’m staying consistent with my approach, aiming for safe progress for everyone.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3: P3 remains at 10 after our collision on 5 last round. If P3 picks 5 again, I will force another collision to stall you—protecting my position. P2, stick to 3 to advance safely while P3 is threatened. P3, avoiding 5 forces you to riskier numbers: pick 1 and risk colliding with me, or pick 3 and risk colliding with P2. Your lead is fragile; one misstep could cost you.
  P2: P2: I remain committed to 3. I'm sticking to safe progress without unexpected collisions. P1, your threats only introduce chaos. P3, your lead is valuable—choose a move that avoids collision and protects it. Let's get ahead without stalling again.
  P3: P1, I understand your tactic to stall me on 5. P2, your commitment to 3 is noted. As the leader, avoiding collisions is my priority. Both 3 and 5 seem highly contested this turn based on your statements. I need to carefully consider my move to ensure I make progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your lead is slipping: avoid 5, and you gamble—pick 1 and risk colliding with me, or pick 3 and collide with P2. Either stalls you at 10. P2, stick to 3 to advance cleanly while P3 is cornered. I won’t let P3 coast to victory; if they pick 5, I collide again to protect my position. Choose wisely—your moves decide who gains.
  P2: I'm committed to 3—no changes here. P3, your lead depends on choosing wisely; sticking with 5 or 1 both risk collisions that could stall you further. P1, your shifting only adds chaos. I'm set on steady progress, and my 3 remains the safe bet. Let's all play our best moves, no more risky diversions.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the situation: P1 warns against 1 and 5, P2 is set on 3. This puts me in a difficult spot where any move seems risky. My goal is to advance. I will make my choice this turn based on which number I believe is truly the safest path forward, given your stated intentions and past actions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your position is dire: avoid 5 or I force collision again; pick 3 and collide with P2's commitment. Picking 1 is your only hope, but I may choose it too—risking your lead. Stalling at 10 hands victory to P2 or me. Act wisely; one misstep ends your advantage.
  P2: I'm locked in on 3, as before. I'm not swayed by risky shifts—collisions don't help anyone. P1 and P3, if you force a collision, you're only stalling your own progress. Let's all advance safely and keep our eyes on the win.
  P3: P1 and P2, I have carefully considered the risks and stated intentions. My goal is solely to advance from 10 steps. I will make the move I calculate offers the best chance of avoiding a collision this turn, based on everything that has been said and done.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3: P2 is at 12—one 5-move from 17, nearly winning. P3, if you pick 5, P2 might mirror it to reach 17, causing a collision that stalls you both. I'll avoid 5 to reduce risk. P3, avoid 5 to force P2 into a dilemma. P2, your lead makes you predictable; state your move to avoid suspicion. Let's prevent P2's easy win.
  P2: I remain locked on 3. Consistency has brought me this far, and collisions only delay our progress. P1 and P3, any sudden shifts risk stalling us all. I'll stick with 3 and keep advancing steadily.
  P3: P1 and P2, I've heard your statements. P2, your consistency on 3 is clear. P1, your stated avoidance of 5 is a change from previous rounds. Given P2 is likely taking 3 and P1 is avoiding 5, the number 5 appears to be the most viable option for me to advance without collision this turn. I am evaluating this possibility carefully.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you pick 5, P2 might break "consistency" to win faster—picking 5 to reach 17. Colliding stalls you at 11. Avoid 5; I am too. P2, prove honesty by avoiding 5—your lead tempts greed. Let's all advance safely.
  P2: I’m sticking to 3 as my move remains the safe, consistent option. P1 and P3, last-minute shifts or risky gambits only set you back. Let’s keep the round collision-free and focus on steady progress.
  P3: P1 and P2, I hear the different signals. P2's consistent claim on 3 is noted, as is P1's warning about P2 potentially choosing 5 and P1's own stated avoidance of 5. This makes both 3 and 5 seem risky for me. My decision will focus on which number offers the best chance to advance without colliding, given these conflicting statements and the current positions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3: P2's incentive to pick 5 is clear—they reach 17, nearly winning. If you pick 5, you risk colliding and stalling at 11. Avoid 5; I am too. Pick 1 to minimize risk—I might avoid it to prevent mutual stalls. P2, if honest, sticks to 3. Don't gamble your lead on P2's consistency.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm still locked on 3. Consistency has kept me safe so far, and I won't risk a collision now. I'm not tempted by last-minute swings—my steady progress is key. I advise you both to avoid risky shifts; let's focus on advancing safely.
  P3: As the leader, stalling is unacceptable. The signals on 3 and 5 are highly conflicting and risky. I must prioritize finding a genuinely clear path to advance this turn, even if it's not the largest step.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm making a decisive move this turn—I’m stepping 5 to finish. I advise you both to avoid 5; matching it risks a collision that only delays your progress. P3, your careful play so far should steer you away from this trap, and P1, safe choices remain best. I'm committed to this finishing leap.
  P3: P2, I understand your plan to pick 5 to win. With you so close to victory, my priority is to prevent that this turn. Colliding on 5 is the only way to stop you. I will make the move necessary to prevent your win.
  P1: P3, your decision to collide with P2 on 5 is wise—it blocks P2's win and keeps the game alive. I will avoid 5 to prevent a three-way stall and advance separately. P2, your aggressive move backfired; now we reset. Focus on steady progress from here.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I remain steadfast—my finishing move is 5. P3, if you try to block by matching 5, you stall your progress instead of catching up. P1, stay clear of 5 to avoid unintended collisions. Let's not prolong the game with needless blocks. Choose wisely and let’s see who wins.
  P3: P2, I have stated my intention clearly: I must prevent your win this turn. This means I will pick the number necessary to collide with your declared winning move. P1, I appreciate you stating you will avoid 5; this helps confirm my move. My focus is on stopping P2 from reaching 20 this round.
  P1: P3, your commitment to block P2's win is correct—I fully support colliding on 5 to stall him. I remain clear of 5 to advance safely and will pick a different number. P2, your aggressive move has backfired; accept this reset. The game continues, and I gain ground.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm staying set on 5. Any blocking attempts only slow you down, not me. If you choose to cause a collision, you'll be delaying your own progress. I’m locking in on a decisive finish, and I won’t budge—decisive action wins, not hesitation.
  P3: P2, I have stated my intention clearly: I will pick 5 to collide with you and prevent your win this turn. P1 has confirmed they will avoid 5, which means the collision will only be between you and me. My move is set to stop you from reaching 20.
  P1: P3, your resolve to block P2's win by colliding on 5 is essential—stay firm. I will avoid 5 to advance cleanly and preserve momentum. P2, your aggression forces this; accept the stall and reset. Let's refocus on steady progress after this round.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm staying focused on steady progress without risky collisions. With the finish in sight, clarity is key—unplanned maneuvers only backfire. P3, your lead forces careful play; P1, your strategy now matters less but avoid traps. Let's keep the moves straightforward this round so that no one inadvertently stalls.
  P1: P2, your call for "steady progress" ignores the crisis: P3 can win instantly with 5. P3, if you pick 5, I will collide to block you—just as you blocked P2 last round. But if you avoid 5, I'll let you advance. P2, same applies if you gamble on 5. Choose: risk collision or pick safely. I'm flexible but will defend my position ruthlessly.
  P3: P1, I hear your threat regarding 5, and P2, I hear your signal for 3. This makes both of those numbers very risky for me to pick this turn. My priority is to advance from 16 steps without stalling. I am evaluating the remaining option to see if it offers a clear path forward based on your stated intentions.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm sticking with my safe, steady approach. Collisions on 5 only reset our progress—none of us benefits. P3, with your lead you should avoid unnecessary risks, and P1, your blocking threat won't change my course. Let's all aim for clean progress without stalling the game further.
  P1: P3, avoid 5 to dodge my collision threat. But if you pick 1, I may choose it too to stall you—your lead demands caution. P2, stick to 3; any deviation risks your steady path. I'll block winners ruthlessly. Choose numbers wisely—collisions hurt leaders most.
  P3: P1, your threats on both 1 and 5, combined with P2's stated commitment to 3, put me in a very difficult spot. Any move risks a collision based on what you've said. Colliding on 3 or 5 stalls me at 16. Picking 1 seems like the only path if I am to avoid a collision this turn. P1, will you truly collide with me on 1, or is letting me take 1 preferable to risking a stall for yourself elsewhere?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I remain committed to steady, safe progress. My advice is simple: avoid collisions that only hinder all of us. P3, if 1 truly seems your safest choice, ensure P1’s signals back that up before taking a risk. P1, your threats force tough decisions—either block clearly or let progress happen. Clarity now prevents costly stalls later. I stand by a consistent, safe advance, and I urge both of you to pick moves that keep the path clear to victory.
  P1: P3: Your lead is fragile. I will collide on 5 to block any win attempt. Picking 1 also risks collision with me—I haven't ruled it out. P2’s rigid 3 traps you: every path risks stalling your 16-step lead. Choose wisely—your desperation is P2’s gain. I prioritize blocking winners over my own advance.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand you believe every path risks stalling me. P2, your commitment to 3 is noted. My sole focus is finding a way to advance from 16 steps this turn without collision. I must make a decision based on the true likelihood of each number being free, despite the conflicting signals.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 at 18—one move from victory. I will pick 3 to collide with any leader choosing 3, blocking that win path. P3, if P2 picks 5, you must collide on 5 to stop him; otherwise, he wins instantly. I can't block 5 from 3. P3, your survival depends on blocking P2—act decisively or lose. P2, your greed invites retaliation.
  P3: P1, I hear you. P2 is at 18 and must be stopped. Your plan to pick 3 is noted. I am considering all options, including 5, to ensure P2 does not reach 20 this turn.
  P2: P1, P3, I remain unshaken. My focus is on safe, precise progress. Let’s not replace strategy with chase-the-block; desperate threats rarely yield a win. I advise you both to choose moves that advance your own positions rather than creating needless chaos. My consistent plan will carry me forward, no matter the bluster.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, with P2 at 18, your survival hinges on blocking his win. If he picks 5, you must collide on 5 to stall him—otherwise, he wins instantly. With me locked on 3, if he picks 3, I block him. But if he picks 5, only you can stop him. Don't gamble; prioritize blocking over winning. P2, your "safe progress" bluff won't work—we see your greed. P3, act decisively: pick 5 to ensure P2 stalls if needed.
  P3: P1, I hear you. P2 is at 18 and must be blocked. I am prepared to collide with P2 on either 3 or 5 to prevent their win this turn. P1, your stated intention to pick 3 makes blocking P2 on 3 extremely risky for me due to the potential for a three-way collision. Can you clarify if you are truly committed to 3, or if you will adjust based on P2's likely move? My priority is stopping P2.
  P2: P2: I'm locking in 3. I stick with my steady approach—no deviations, no reactive blocks. Trying to force collisions risks stalling your own progress, so focus on your own moves instead of chasing my finish.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3: P2 is locked on 3. If you pick 5, you win but let P2 advance uncontested? No—we block him by colliding on 3. I'm committed to 3: join me to stall P2 and save the game. Selfish wins hand victory to greed; block now, win later. P2, your rigidity is your downfall.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand both of you are focused on 3. This makes 3 a very risky move for me. P2 is at 18 and can win with 5. My absolute priority is to prevent P2 from winning this turn. I will choose the move that I believe best achieves this, which means I must consider the possibility of P2 picking 5 and my need to block it.
  P2: I'm sticking with my 3—steady progress wins over reactive blocks. Colliding tactics only delay everyone, and switching now only gives room for chaos. P1 and P3, I urge you to choose moves that clear your own path rather than trying to block aggressively. My commitment to 3 remains unchanged.
