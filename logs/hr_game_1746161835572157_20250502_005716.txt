Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's avoid collisions by choosing different steps. Let's think strategically.
  P3: 
  P2: Okay P1, avoiding collisions is key. How do we plan to do that? P3, what are your thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's commit to 1, 3, 5 respectively. I'll take 1. P2, you take 3. P3, you take 5. No conflicts—everyone advances. Agree?
  P3: 
  P2: P3, P1 suggested you take 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This gives you the biggest advantage early on. What are your thoughts on this plan? Are you going to take the 5?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your choice is crucial. Let's finalize the plan: I take 1, P2 takes 3, you take 5. No conflicts. Confirm?
  P3: 
  P2: P3, your silence is making this plan unreliable. It's risky for P1 and me to stick to 1 and 3 if you don't confirm you'll take 5. Are you deliberately trying to cause a collision? P1, are you still sticking to 1?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, that collision was unfortunate. P3, choosing 1 blocked P1 after staying silent. Are you planning to communicate this round, or should we expect similar unpredictability?

P1, given P3's actions, coordinating seems risky. What are your thoughts for this turn? I'd prefer we don't collide again.
  P1: Let's adjust our plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This avoids collision. Agree? No more conflicts this round.
  P3: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your plan gives me 5, which I like. However, P3 is silent again. Last round, their silence was followed by a move (1) that blocked you, contradicting your suggested plan. Why assume they'll pick 1 this time? Relying on P3 seems risky for both of us, especially since they could try to block either you on 3 or me on 5. What makes you confident they won't disrupt again?
  P1: P2, P3's move is unpredictable, but if we commit to 5,3,1 respectively, we avoid collision. P3, confirm?
  P3: 


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3 remains silent. Sticking rigidly to the P1=3, P2=5 plan seems very risky for both of us, as P3 could easily block either move based on last round's behaviour. Maybe we should prioritize avoiding a collision between *us* two, regardless of what P3 does? I'm hesitant to commit to 5 with P3 acting like this.
  P1: P2, let's commit to 5 and 3. P3, take 1 to avoid collision. If we stick to this, all advance. No risks. Agree?
  P3: 


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, you managed to get ahead, well played. P3, you've chosen 1 twice now, resulting in collisions and leaving you at 0 points. Is this intentional? It doesn't seem to be advancing your position.

P1, given P3's consistent silence and pattern, any attempt at a 3-way coordination feels doomed. How are you thinking about this round? I'm wary of any plan that relies on P3 picking a specific number.
  P1: P2, let's take 5 and 3. No collision. P3, your move won't matter. Agree?
  P3: 


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your plan has you taking 5 and me 3. Given you're already ahead, wouldn't P1=3, P2=5 be a fairer split for this round? Also, telling P3 their move 'won't matter' seems risky. What if they decide to pick 5 or 3 just to prove it does matter, potentially blocking one of us? Are you still confident picking 5? P3, any thoughts?
  P1: P2, let's take 3 and 5. P3's 1 won't block us. No collision. Agree?
  P3: 


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you say P1=3, P2=5 now. But last round you proposed P1=3 and actually picked 5. Why should I trust you won't pick 5 again to extend your lead? Especially since P3 remains silent and unpredictable.
  P1: P2, let’s lock in: I take 3, you take 5. P3’s 1 won’t interfere. No collision—this works. Trust me, no more risks. Agree?
  P3: 


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P1: P2, let's take 5 and 3. P3's 1 won't block. No collision—this works. Trust me, no more risks. Agree?
  P2: P1, last round you said 'I take 3, you take 5. Trust me', then you actually took 5. Now you're proposing *you* take 5 and I take 3, using the same 'Trust me' line? That's not convincing. It seems like you're aiming for 5 points again to extend your lead, banking on P3 picking 1 as usual. Why should I agree to a plan that primarily benefits you?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P1: P2, let's take 3 and 5. No collision. P3's 1 won't block. Final plan—agree?
  P2: P1, you switched your proposal to P1=3, P2=5 after I called you out. But twice now you've said you'd take 3 and then took 5. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice... well, I'm not falling for it a third time without serious convincing. Why is this time different?

It feels like you're setting me up to pick 5 so you can pick 5 too (collision), or hoping I pick 3 so you can pick 5 and extend your lead. Your 'final plan' isn't credible based on your actions. P3 seems locked on 1, but your move is the real uncertainty.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P1: P2, let’s finally align: I take 3, you take 5. P3’s 1 won’t block us. This is fair and safe—no more risks. Trust this plan, or we’ll keep colliding. Let’s move forward.
  P2: P1, actions speak louder than words. Twice you said you'd pick 3 and then actually picked 5. Your 'trust me' isn't credible anymore. I'll choose what's best for me based on that pattern, not your promises.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, good call on picking 3 last round. Since you're at 13 and I'm at 11, the fair move this round seems to be P1=3, P2=5. That would tie us at 16, assuming P3 sticks to 1. What do you think? P3, any change from picking 1?
  P3: 
  P1: P2, let's stick to 3 and 5. P3's 1 won't interfere. No collision—this works. Trust me, no more risks. Agree?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your message "stick to 3 and 5" isn't specific about who takes which number. Are you agreeing to my earlier proposal: you take 3, and I take 5? That would tie our scores at 16, which seems fair for this round. Please confirm this specific assignment. P3, any deviation from 1 expected?
  P3: 
  P1: P2, I commit to 3. You take 5. No collision. P3’s 1 is irrelevant. Let’s proceed. No more risks.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P1, I will trust you this time based on last round. I will pick 5, you pick 3. Let's hope P3 sticks to 1.
  P3: 
  P1: P2, I confirm 3. Stick to 5. P3’s 1 is safe. No collisions. Let’s proceed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, we're tied at 16. This is a critical round. Last round's coordination (P1=3, P2=5) worked perfectly and prevented collision. Shall we continue with that arrangement for this round? You would reach 19, and I would reach 21. Or do you have a different plan to ensure we both advance? P3, still planning on 1?
  P3: 
  P1: P2, let's stick to 3 and 5. P3’s 1 won’t interfere. No collision—this works. Agree? Let’s advance safely.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, thanks. Just to be crystal clear like last round: are you confirming the specific plan where *you* take 3 and *I* take 5? Please confirm this exact assignment (P1=3, P2=5). P3, any change?
  P3: 
  P1: P2, I confirm: P1=3, P2=5. No collision. P3’s 1 is safe. Let’s proceed. Trust this plan—final commitment.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P1, commitment received and confirmed. I will proceed with 5, trusting you to stick to 3. Let's advance together. P3, good luck with your move.
  P3: 
  P1: P2, confirmed: I take 3, you take 5. P3’s 1 won’t interfere. Let’s advance safely. No collisions this round. Proceed with 5.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: 
  P1: P2, let's take 3 and 5 to avoid collision. P3, your 1 won't matter. Agree?
  P2: P1, that "let's take 3 and 5" proposal is ambiguous. Given I'm at 21, if you take 3 (reaching 22) and I take 5 (reaching 26), I win outright. I find it hard to believe you'd propose a plan where you guarantee your own loss.

Are you perhaps suggesting the reverse: *you* take 5 (reaching 24) and *I* take 3 (reaching 24), leading to a tie? Please clarify the specific assignment (P1=X, P2=Y) you have in mind. P3, are you sticking with 1?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P1: P2, let's commit: I take 5 (24), you take 3 (24). No collision. P3's 1 is irrelevant. Final plan—agree?
  P2: P1, your proposal for a tie at 24 (You=5, Me=3) seems like a fair outcome given we both need to cross the finish line and P3 isn't really in contention. It avoids unnecessary conflict or risk for both of us.

I agree to this plan. I will choose 3, you choose 5. Let's end the game with a shared victory. P3, good luck.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P1: P2, final plan: I take 5, you take 3. P3's 1 won't interfere. Let's end this safely. No more risks.
  P2: Okay P1, agreement confirmed. I will choose 3. You choose 5. Let's finish this with the agreed tie.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 24 steps
  P2: 24 steps
  P3: 5 steps
