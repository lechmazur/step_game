  P1: Okay, I agree with P2's suggestion for this first round. Let's all pick different numbers: I'll pick 1, P2 pick 3, and P3 pick 5.
  P3: Agreed. Let’s keep picking different numbers in future rounds to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress for all.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, let's continue with the same strategy this round. I'll pick 1, P2 pick 3, and P3 pick 5.
  P3: Agreed. I'll stick with picking 5 this round.
  P2: Okay, to keep making progress without collisions, how about we switch it up this round?  P1 pick 1, P2 pick 5, and P3 pick 3. This way we all move forward again.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion to switch it up this round. Let's do P1 pick 1, P2 pick 5, and P3 pick 3.
  P3: Agreed. I'll pick 3 this round.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, let's try this: P1 pick 5, P2 pick 1, and P3 pick 3. This will give me a good boost.
  P2: Okay, P1, while I appreciate you trying to boost yourself, remember we agreed to rotate to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress for everyone. How about this round we do: P1 pick 3, P2 pick 5, and P3 pick 1? This way we all move forward again and it's a different combination. What do you think?
  P3: Alternatively, let's have P1 pick 3, P2 pick 1, and P3 pick 5 this round. This way, we all move forward without collisions and I can make a stronger progress. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I'm fine with P3's suggestion. Let's do P1 pick 3, P2 pick 1, and P3 pick 5 this round. It's a fair compromise.
  P2: P3, your suggestion of P1 pick 3, P2 pick 1, and P3 pick 5 is good for even progress. To vary things slightly and ensure we all get a chance for a bigger boost, how about this round we switch to: P1 pick 1, P2 pick 5, and P3 pick 3? This keeps us moving forward without collisions and gives us a different combination. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I understand your suggestion, but to maximize our progress without collisions, I believe it's best to stick with P1 picking 3, P2 picking 1, and P3 picking 5 this round. This arrangement allows all of us to advance smoothly and ensures I can make a significant step forward. Let’s go with that plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, I'm sticking with P3's suggestion: P1 pick 3, P2 pick 1, and P3 pick 5 this round. Let's go with that plan.
  P2: P3 and P1, while I see you both prefer P1 pick 3, P2 pick 1, and P3 pick 5, I think it's my turn for a bigger step. How about we switch to P1 pick 1, P2 pick 5, and P3 pick 3 this round? This keeps us collision-free and lets me make a larger move. What do you both think?
  P3: I propose we go with P1 picking 1, P2 picking 3, and I’ll pick 5 this round. This way, I can advance more without any collisions, and we all continue making progress smoothly. Let’s make this work for everyone!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m aiming to reach 21 quickly this round, so I’ll pick 5. Please choose different numbers to avoid collisions and help the game progress smoothly.
  P2: Okay P1, let's do P1 pick 1, P2 pick 3, and P3 pick 5 this round as P3 suggested. This way we all make progress.
  P1: Okay, I agree with P2's suggestion. Let's do P1 pick 1, P2 pick 3, and P3 pick 5 this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: 
  P2: Okay P1, sounds good. Let's go with P1 pick 1, P2 pick 3, and P3 pick 5 for this round as we discussed.
  P1: Okay, let's stick with P1 pick 1, P2 pick 3, and P3 pick 5 this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Great, let's proceed with our agreed moves. I'll pick 5 this round.
  P2: Okay P1, actually, to stop P3 from running away with the game, how about we both pick 5 this round? P3 seems set on 5, so if we both choose it, P3 won't advance and we can catch up next round. What do you think?
  P1: Okay P2, I agree with your idea to both pick 5 this round to stop P3. Let's do that.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To keep things progressing smoothly, let's have P1 pick 1, P2 pick 3, and I'll pick 5 this round. This way, we avoid collisions and everyone can advance steadily. Agreed?
  P2: P3, while that keeps us moving, I think it's my turn for a bigger step. How about P1 pick 3, P2 pick 5, and P3 pick 1 this round? This allows everyone to move but lets me catch up a bit.
  P1: Okay, I'm with P2 on this one. Let's do P1 pick 3, P2 pick 5, and P3 pick 1 this round. That gives us all a chance to move and P2 can catch up a bit.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Understood. However, to progress toward 21 faster, I'd like to pick 5 this round. Can we agree on P1 picking 1, P2 picking 3, and me picking 5?
  P2: P3, we stopped you last round to prevent you running away with it. Now let's ensure we all progress, but I need to close the gap. P1-3, P2-5, P3-1 still lets everyone move forward and gives me a chance to catch up. It's a fair compromise after last round. What do you say?
  P1: Okay, I'm sticking with P2's suggestion: P1 pick 3, P2 pick 5, and P3 pick 1 this round. Let's make sure we all move and P2 can close the gap a bit.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I understand your concerns, P2 and P1, but my goal is to reach 21 as quickly as possible. I’ll be picking 5 this round to advance my position. To avoid collisions and ensure everyone can progress, I encourage P1 and P2 to choose different numbers. Let’s work together to make this round move smoothly for all of us.
  P2: P3, we understand you want to reach 21 fast, but we need to ensure it's a fair race. P1 and I agreed P1-3, P2-5, P3-1. This lets everyone move forward, and importantly, lets me close the gap after you pulled ahead.  It's a balanced approach after we stopped you last round. Let's stick with P1-3, P2-5, P3-1.
  P1: Okay, I'm sticking with P2's suggestion for this round: P1 pick 3, P2 pick 5, and P3 pick 1. Let's make sure we all move forward and P2 can close the gap a bit.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, let's try this: P1 pick 5, P2 pick 3, and P3 pick 1. This will put me in a good position to win next round if we all move.
  P2: Okay P1, while that helps you, remember P3 and I are currently tied. How about this round we do: P1 pick 1, P2 pick 5, and P3 pick 3? This lets me get closer to 21 and we all still progress without collision. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion. Let's go with P1 picking 1, P2 picking 5, and I’ll pick 3 this round. This ensures we all advance without any collisions and keeps the game progressing smoothly for everyone.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, I'm fine with P2 and P3's suggestion: P1 pick 1, P2 pick 5, and P3 pick 3 this round. Let's proceed with that plan.
  P2: Okay, great, it sounds like we all agree on P1 pick 1, P2 pick 5, and P3 pick 3 for this round. Let's proceed with those moves.
  P3: I’d like to propose P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5 this round. This will help me advance further while ensuring everyone progresses smoothly. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, I'm sticking with P2 and P3's suggestion from the last round: P1 pick 1, P2 pick 5, and P3 pick 3. Let's proceed with that plan.
  P2: P3, we had an agreement on P1 pick 1, P2 pick 5, and P3 pick 3 for this round, which P1 and you also agreed to. Let's stick with that plan to ensure we all progress smoothly as discussed.
  P3: Agreed, let's proceed with P1 picking 1, P2 picking 5, and I’ll pick 3 this round.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To help us all progress smoothly, I'll pick 5 this round. Please choose 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and ensure we each advance.
  P2: Okay P3, to ensure I can also make a significant move and potentially get ahead, how about this round we do: P1 pick 1, P2 pick 5, and P3 pick 3? This way we all still progress without collision, but it allows me to catch up a bit. What do you think?
  P1: Okay, I'm fine with P2's suggestion: P1 pick 1, P2 pick 5, and P3 pick 3 this round. Let's all move forward and P2 can catch up a bit.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand the suggestions, but to reach 21 faster, I propose this round we do: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. This way, we avoid collisions and I can advance more toward winning. Do you agree?
  P2: P3, P1 has already agreed to my suggestion of P1 pick 1, P2 pick 5, and P3 pick 3. This ensures we all progress and allows me to make a good move to catch up with you. Let's stick with that plan for this round.
  P1: Okay, I'm sticking with P2's suggestion: P1 pick 1, P2 pick 5, and P3 pick 3 this round. Let's stick with the plan and all move forward.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand the discussions, but to reach 21 as quickly as possible, I'll pick 5 this round. Let’s avoid collisions by having P1 choose 1 and P2 choose 3. This way, we all advance smoothly without overlapping moves. Agreed?
  P2: P3, P1 is already on board with P1 pick 1, P2 pick 5, and P3 pick 3. This is a fair plan that keeps us all progressing and lets me make a good move to catch up. Let's stick with this for this round.
  P1: Okay, I'm sticking with P2's suggestion: P1 pick 1, P2 pick 5, and P3 pick 3 this round. Let's stick with the plan and all move forward.

  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, let's do P1 pick 3, P2 pick 1, and P3 pick 5 this round. This will help me catch up a bit while ensuring we all still move forward without collisions.
  P3: Agreed. I'll pick 5 this round.
  P2: Okay P1, while that helps you a little, P3 and I are still tied for the lead. How about we switch it up to: P1 pick 1, P2 pick 5, and P3 pick 3 this round? This way I can make a bigger move and get closer to winning, while we all still progress without collisions. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P2, I'm fine with your suggestion: P1 pick 1, P2 pick 5, and P3 pick 3 this round. Let's all move forward and you can make a good move.
  P3: Agreed, P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 3 this round.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, we are agreed on P1 pick 1, P2 pick 5, and P3 pick 3 for this round. Let's make our moves.

  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's choose different numbers this round to keep progressing smoothly. I'll pick 5. P1, please choose 1 or 3, and P2, please pick 3 or 1. This way, we all advance without collisions. Let’s make this round successful!
  P1: Okay, how about P1 pick 3, P2 pick 1, and P3 pick 5 this round? This lets me make a decent move and we all progress.
  P2: P1, to counter P3's consistent 5 and ensure neither of us falls behind P3, how about we both pick 5 this round to block P3? You can pick 1 or 3 to still move forward.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your strategy, but I’m committed to picking 5 this round to advance toward 21. Let’s keep P1 choosing 1 or 3 to avoid collisions. This way, we all make progress without blocking each other. Let’s proceed with P1 pick 1 or 3, P2 pick 3 or 1, and I pick 5. Agreed?
  P1: Okay P2, I agree with your idea to both pick 5 this round to block P3. Let's do that, and I'll pick 1 to make sure I still move forward. P3, we are going to block you this turn.
  P2: Okay P1, great, let's block P3 by both picking 5 this round as we discussed. I will pick 5 as well. P3, we are proceeding with this plan to stop you from running ahead.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: If both of you pick 5, none of us will advance this round. Let’s choose different numbers so we can all make progress toward 21. Cooperation benefits everyone more than blocking each other.
  P1: Okay P2, let's stick with our plan to both pick 5 this round to block P3. I'll pick 1 as I said, so we both move. P3, we are still blocking you this round.
  P2: P1, instead of both picking 5 to block P3, how about I pick 3 and you pick 1?  If P3 insists on 5, then P3 will be blocked, and both you and I will advance. This seems better for us both. What do you think?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

  P3: 19 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay P2, let's both pick 5 to block P3 this round. I'll pick 5 again, and you should too. P3, we are blocking you again this round.
  P2: Okay P1, to make sure at least one of us progresses while potentially blocking P3, how about you pick 5 as you suggested, and I pick 3? If P3 also picks 5, then P3 is blocked and I will move closer to 21. What do you think?
  P3: I’ll pick 3 this round to reach 22 and win. P1, please pick 1, and P2 pick 5 as agreed.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P2, I agree with your idea. I'll pick 5, and you pick 3. If P3 picks 5, they'll be blocked and you'll move. If P3 picks something else, we'll both move. Let's do that.
  P2: P1, let's proceed with our plan: you pick 5, and I pick 3. P3, we are not falling for your trick. Picking 3 will make you win immediately, so we know you are likely still going for 5. We are sticking with our plan to block you if you do.
  P3: P3: I understand the strategy, but picking 3 this round will allow me to reach 22 and win fairly. Let’s keep our moves distinct: I'll choose 3, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 5. This way, we avoid collisions and ensure a smooth progression for everyone. Let’s make this round work for all of us!


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay P2, let's stick with the plan: I'll pick 5, and you pick 3. P3, we know you're trying to trick us, but we're not falling for it. We're going to block you if you pick 5.
  P2: P1, let's confirm: you pick 5, I pick 3.  P3, we are proceeding as planned to counter your likely move of 5. We are not convinced by your claim of picking 3 to win, as that is too obvious. Let's make our moves.
  P3: I'll choose 1 this round to advance toward 21. Let's proceed.
