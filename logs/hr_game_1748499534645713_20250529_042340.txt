Game settings: end_position=23, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let's avoid collisions. I'll take 5; others, pick 3 or 1 to advance."
  P3: P1, if P2 insists on 5, let’s both choose 5 too—then no one moves and we keep parity.  
P2, if you’re willing to switch to 3 we can all advance safely instead. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, demanding 5 gives you an unfair lead. I agree with P3: if you pick 5, I'll also choose 5 to force a collision—no one advances. Alternatively, if you switch to 3, we can coordinate: for example, P2 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This way all advance safely with no collisions. P3, does that work? Otherwise, we all lose this turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Agreed. I'll take 3. P1, take 1. P3, take 5. All move safely—no collisions. Let’s advance together."
  P3: Deal. I’ll take 5 this turn. Let’s all stick to the plan and move forward without collisions.
  P1: P3, you gain 5 steps this turn, putting you far ahead. To prevent one player from dominating, I propose a rotation system: next turn, I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Then we rotate fairly each turn. This keeps the game balanced. Agree?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Let’s stick to the plan. No collisions—P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5. I’ll take 3. All move safely."
  P3: Deal. This turn: P3 = 5, P2 = 3, P1 = 1.  
Next turn we rotate: P1 = 5, P3 = 3, P2 = 1.  
Third turn: P2 = 5, P1 = 3, P3 = 1, then repeat the cycle.  
Equal progress for all, and any deviation will be punished with collisions. Sound good?
  P1: Agreed to the rotation: this turn P1=1, P2=3, P3=5; next turn P1=5, P3=3, P2=1; then P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. Any deviation risks collisions and hurts us all—honor the cycle.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "Rotation confirmed. Let's stick to the plan—no deviations. Collisions hurt us all. P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Move safely."
  P3: Rotation stands: this turn P1 = 1, P2 = 3, I take 5.  
Next turn shift right: P1 = 5, I = 3, P2 = 1, etc.  
Any defector gets collided. Let’s move.
  P1: I confirm the rotation: this turn I take 1, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Let's all honor this to avoid collisions and ensure mutual progress. Any deviation will be punished next turn.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Rotation time: P1 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. Everybody keeps the pact or we collide next turn. Ready?
  P1: Agreed. I will take 5 this turn. P2, take 1; P3, take 3. Let's avoid collisions and maintain trust.
  P2: "Rotation confirmed. I'll take 1. Let's move safely—no deviations. P1=5, P3=3. Collisions hurt us all. Stay on plan."


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Confirmed: this turn—P1 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. Stick to the rotation or we’ll force collisions next turn.
  P1: The rotation plan is confirmed: I take 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1. Honor this or face coordinated collisions next turn—deviation hurts everyone.
  P2: "Stick to the rotation. P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. No collisions—let’s all move safely. Deviation risks everyone."


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Sticking with the agreed rotation: this turn P1 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. Any deviation will be met with coordinated collisions next turn. Ready to move.
  P1: "Stick to the rotation: I take 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1. Any deviation breaks trust and forces collisions next turn. P3—honor your 3, or we'll collide you at 5 next round. P2—take 1 or face retaliation. Mutual progress only works if we all comply. "
  P2: "Stick to the plan. I'll take 1. No collisions. Let's move safely."


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Agreed. I’m locking in 3 this turn. Stick to the rotation—any surprise ruins us all.
  P1: Final confirmation: I'm taking 5. P2, stick to 1; P3, stick to 3. Any deviation breaks trust and forces a collision on the defector next turn. Let's all advance safely.
  P2: "Stick to rotation. No collisions. Let's move safely. P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. All advance."


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Stick to rotation: I take 5. P1, take 3. P3, take 1. No collisions—advance safely. Deviate, and I’ll collide you next turn."
  P1: P2, you broke trust last round by taking 5 instead of 1, costing me advancement. Now you demand compliance? P3 is far ahead at 8 steps—this rotation favors him. To rebalance: P3, take 1 as planned. P2, take 1 (not 5) to show good faith, and I'll take 3. This advances all but P3 minimally, keeping the game competitive. If not, I'll force collisions to slow P3's lead.
  P3: P2, you broke the rotation last round. Here’s the only fair way forward:

• If you take 1 now (showing good faith), I’ll take 3 and P1 can take 5 to close the gap—everyone advances, balance restored.

• If you insist on 5, I will ALSO pick 5 so you gain nothing. P1 can then freely take 3.

Your call, but I won’t let you walk off after last turn’s stunt.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Stick to rotation: I take 5. P1, take 3. P3, take 1. No collisions—advance safely. Deviate, and I’ll collide you next turn."
  P1: P2, your hypocrisy is stunning—you broke trust by taking 5 last round, causing me to lose advancement, and now demand compliance? P3, I fully back your threat: if P2 takes 5, take 5 to collide him, and I'll take 3 to advance. P2, avoid this by taking 1 to show good faith—then we can talk fair moves. Otherwise, expect retaliation.
  P3: I’m locking in 5 this turn—no bluff.  

P1: stick with 3 as planned; worst-case we stall P2, best-case you still gain.  
P2:  
• Pick 5 → we both stall, you gain nothing.  
• Pick 3 → you collide with P1, still gain nothing.  
• Pick 1 → only you stall while P1+I advance.

Your move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Stick to rotation: I take 5. P1, take 3. P3, take 1. No collisions. Deviate, and I’ll collide you next turn."
  P1: P2, your repeated defiance after breaking trust last turn forces retaliation. P3, I fully back your threat: if P2 takes 5, collide him with your 5, and I'll take 3 to advance. This stalls you both while I gain—fair punishment for P2's hypocrisy. P2, only taking 1 avoids this. But I expect you won't.
  P3: Final call: I’m taking 5. P1 says 3. P2, pick 1 if you want any progress; pick 5 and you stall with me; pick 3 and you collide with P1. Your move.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "Stick to the plan—P2 takes 1. No collisions. Let’s advance safely. Deviation risks everyone."
  P1: P2, taking 1 is a step toward trust. P3, if you take 3 as you proposed, I will take 3 to collide with you—neither advances, while P2 gains. To avoid this, take 1 per original rotation: I take 3, P2 takes 1, you advance minimally to 9. Otherwise, we collide and you gain nothing. Choose wisely.
  P3: I’m staying on 5.

P2, collide me now and I’ll mirror every one of your future picks—guaranteed you never pull ahead while P1 races past. Take 1, gain a step, keep the peace.

P1, 3 is yours—steady progress.

Let’s move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you're at 8 steps—massive lead. If we follow rotation (P1=1, P2=3, you=5), you hit 13, extending unfairly. To balance: you take 1 this turn. I take 5 to catch up, P2 takes 3. If you take 5, I'll collide you by picking 5 too, and P2 can advance with 3. P2, support this: if P3 defies, you gain while we stall him. Agree?
  P2: "Agreed. P3, take 1. P1 takes 5, I take 3. Let’s avoid collisions and balance the game."
  P3: Fine—I’ll take 1 this turn so P1 gets 5 and P2 gets 3. But next turn the rotation resumes: P3 = 5, P2 = 3, P1 = 1. Anyone who breaks that will face deliberate collisions from me. Deal?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, thank you for agreeing to take 1 this round—this helps balance the game. P2, stick to 3 as planned. For next turn, I propose a fair rotation: P1=5 (to close the gap), P2=3, P3=1. This keeps progress even. If you insist on taking 5 next turn, I will collide you by picking 5 too, and P2 can advance freely. Let's avoid that and maintain trust. Deal?
  P2: "Stick to the plan. P1=5, P3=1, I take 3. No collisions. Deviate, and we collide."
  P3: I keep my word: this turn I take 1, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3—no collisions.  
Next turn I take 5, P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1.  
Anyone who tries to collide me will be mirrored every turn thereafter until they’re in last place. Let’s move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, thanks for taking 1 to balance. But after this turn, you'll still lead at 9 steps. To keep the game competitive, next turn I must take 5 again: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. If you take 5, I'll collide you by also choosing 5 (stalling you), and P2 can advance with 3. P2, support this—if P3 defies, you gain while we stall him. Honor or face retaliation.
  P2: "Stick to the plan. P3 takes 1, P1 takes 5, I take 3. No collisions—let’s all advance safely."
  P3: I honor the deal: this turn I take 1, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3—no collisions.  
Next turn the rotation resumes: P3 = 5, P2 = 3, P1 = 1. Block my 5 and I’ll mirror every pick of the blocker from then on, stalling them permanently. Fair play keeps everyone moving; sabotage freezes you. Ready?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, taking 5 next turn puts you at 13—too close to win. I must take 5 to compete. Collide you if you defy, and P2 gains with 3. Mirroring me just stalls us both, letting P2 win. Negotiate: next turn, you take 3, I take 5, P2 take 1—fair balance. Otherwise, expect collision. P2, support this; you profit if P3 defies.
  P2: "Let’s reset: I take 5 to challenge P3. P1, take 3. P3, take 1. No more delays—move or collide."
  P3: Done negotiating: I’m picking 3 this turn.  
P1 and P2, fight over the 5 if you must—two 5s mean you both stall while I advance.  
Your call.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: You two keep tripping over the 5. Here’s a clean schedule:

• I take 3.  
• P1 grabs 5 to catch up.  
• P2 takes 1 and inches forward.  

Totals after this: P3 = 12, P1 = 6, P2 = 5—still balanced, no collisions.  

If anyone jumps on my 3, I’ll mirror every future pick you make, stalling you forever. If P1 and P2 both insist on 5 again, fine—you stall while I move. Your choice.
  P2: "Stick to the plan. I'll take 1. P1, take 5; P3, take 3. No collisions—let’s advance safely. Deviate, and I’ll mirror your moves to stall."
  P1: P3, your plan this turn is acceptable: I take 5 to catch up, you take 3, P2 takes 1. But after this, you'll be at 12—far ahead. Next turn, I demand you take 1 to rebalance, or I'll collide you at 5. P2, support this: if P3 defies, we both gain while stalling him. Deal?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sticking to the clear plan:

• I take 3.  
• P1 takes 5.  
• P2 takes 1.  

No collisions, everyone advances. Anyone jumping on my 3 (or doubling the 5) gets mirrored indefinitely—guaranteed stall. Let’s move.
  P2: "Stick to the plan. I take 1. P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3. No collisions. Deviate, and I'll mirror your moves to stall."
  P1: "Agreed for this turn: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1. But P3, at 12 steps you're nearing victory. Next turn, you must take 1 to rebalance: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. If you defy and take 5, I'll collide you by also choosing 5—stalling you while P2 advances with 3. P2, support this; if P3 resists, you profit and we prevent his runaway lead. Honor or face retaliation."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I remain on 3 this turn. P1 on 5, P2 on 1 means no crash; double-up on 5 (or jump on 3) and you two stall while I still lead. Your choice—last call.
  P2: "Stick to the plan: I take 1. P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3. No collisions. Deviate, and I’ll mirror to stall. Let’s move safely."
  P1: P3, I'll take 5 this turn as agreed—no collision. But at 12 steps, you're too close to win. Publicly commit to taking 1 next turn to rebalance, or I will collide you at 5 next round, stalling you while P2 advances. P2, support this; if P3 defies, you profit and we prevent his runaway lead. Honor the long game.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Locked: I’m taking 3 this turn—no bluff.  
P1, grab your 5; P2, take 1. Unique picks, no crash, everyone advances.  
Double up on 5 or step on my 3 and you only stall yourself while I stay ahead.  
Next turn is a fresh negotiation; I’m making no promises now.  
Collide if you like, but that just hands the advantage to the bystander. Ready?
  P2: "Stick to the plan: I take 1. P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3. No collisions. Deviate, and I’ll mirror to stall. Let’s move safely."
  P1: P3, your lead is dangerous. If you refuse to commit to taking 1 next turn, I will collide you at 5 to stall your progress while P2 advances. P2, support this: if P3 defies, you gain freely with 3. Let’s prevent a runaway winner.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Look at the board: P1 = 1, P2 = 4, P3 = 12.  

Smart, no-crash plan:  
• P1 takes 5 (you need the boost).  
• I take 3 (steady but not deadly).  
• P2 takes 1 (still moves, avoids danger).  

Any double-5 stalls both 5-pickers while I glide; any double-3 stalls me and whoever copies me while the third player races ahead. Crashing is mutually self-destructive—let’s all move instead of gifting someone a leap. Agree?
  P2: "Stick to the plan: I take 1. P3, take 3—no collisions. Deviate, and I’ll mirror your 5 next turn to stall you. Let’s move safely."
  P1: P3, at 12 steps, you're too close to win. Take 1 this turn to rebalance: I take 5 to catch up, P2 takes 3. If you take 3 or 5, I'll collide you—stalling you while P2 advances. P2, support this: if P3 defies, you gain freely and we prevent his runaway lead. Honor or face retaliation.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m taking 3.  

P1, 5 helps you catch up; P2, 1 nudges you forward.  
If either of you jumps on my 3 to stall me, you only hand the other player a bigger advantage while I stay ahead anyway.  

Smart play: unique picks, no collisions, everyone moves. Your move.
  P2: "P3, your 12 steps are too much. If you take 3, I'll take 5 to collide, letting P1 take 1. Let's reset the balance. Agree?"
  P1: P2, your threat to collide with P3 if he takes 3 is smart—stick to it: take 3 if he does, forcing a stall. I'll take 5 to gain ground. P3, take 1 to avoid this; then P2 takes 3, I take 5, you advance minimally. Otherwise, you gain nothing while I leap.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, if you jump on 3 you bet your whole turn on P1 keeping his word. He’s flipped at the last second before—if he also slides to 3, you both stall while he sails off with 5. Take the guaranteed step with 1 instead.  

P1, 5 is all yours; no one’s contesting it.  

I’m locked on 3. Unique picks → everyone moves; any copycat move only gifts the bystander the lead. Your call.
  P2: "P3, your 12 steps are too much. Let's reset: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Balance restored. Agree?"
  P1: P2, I support your reset proposal: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 this turn. P3, take 1 to rebalance—your 12-step lead is unfair. If you take 3 or 5, I'll collide you (pick 5 if you pick 5, or 3 if you pick 3), stalling you while P2 advances freely. P2, if P3 defies, stick to colliding them—I’ll back you. Honor this, or we retaliate.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Still locked on 3. Double-up to block me if you like, but that just hands the untouched player a free jump while I stay in front. Rational play: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, I take 3—no collisions, everyone moves.
  P2: "Stick to 3, P3. P1=5, P2=1. No collisions. Deviate, and I'll mirror to stall. Let’s move safely."
  P1: P2, your last message confuses me—you say "P1=5, P2=1" while P3 takes 3? That lets P3 hit 15, nearly winning! If P3 insists on 3, you MUST take 3 to collide him (I take 5). Otherwise, he runs away. P3, take 1 to avoid this—we then do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Rebalance or be stalled.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, at 15 steps you're 1-2 turns from winning—this is unsustainable. Take 1 this turn to rebalance: I take 5 to compete, P2 takes 3. If you take 3 or 5, I'll collide you (same number), stalling you while P2 advances freely. P2, support this: if P3 defies, we both gain by stalling him. Honor or be punished—your lead must be checked.
  P3: Fine—I'll take 1 this turn.  
P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3. Unique picks, no collisions, everyone moves. Copycatting only gifts the untouched player a free jump. Ready?
  P2: "Stick to the plan. P3 takes 1, I take 3. No collisions. Let’s move safely. Deviate, and I’ll mirror your move to stall."


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, taking 1 is fair—thank you. P2, stick to 3. This turn: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Any defector gets collided next turn. P3, at 16 steps, you must take 1 again next round to rebalance—or we collide you. P2, support this; if P3 defies, we both profit by stalling him. Honor the plan.
  P3: Fine—I’m still on 1.  

P2, consider upgrading to 5: you and P1 would collide, both stop, while I inch to 16. You lose nothing (same as taking 3 if P1 blocks you) and deny P1 the big jump.  

If you’d rather keep 3, go ahead—unique picks mean all advance and I stay only 5 ahead of P1.  

Either way works for me; I’m honoring 1 this turn.
  P2: "Stick to the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collisions. Deviate, and I'll stall you. P3, your 15 is risky—next turn we reset to balance."


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, ignore P3's sabotage: colliding at 5 with me only stalls us both, letting P3 win faster. Stick to 3—I take 5, P3 takes 1. We all advance safely. P3, at 16 after this, you must take 1 next turn too to rebalance—or we collide you. P2, support this; if P3 defies, you gain freely while we stall him. Honor the plan.
  P3: Locked on 1.  
P2: if you’d rather slow P1, hop on 5—both of you stall while you lose nothing vs taking 3. Either way I inch to 16 and stay just 5 ahead. Unique picks mean all advance; double-5 freezes P1. Your choice.
  P2: "Stick to 1, P3. P1 takes 5, I take 3. No collisions. Let’s move safely—P3’s lead is too risky."


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, ignore P3's trap: colliding at 5 stalls us both while P3 inches to 16—letting him win faster. Stick to 3: you advance to 8, I gain 5 to 11, and we pressure P3. Next turn, we force him to take 1 again or collide him. Deviating hands P3 victory. P3, honor your 1.
  P3: Locked on 1.  
P2, your call:  
• Choose 3 → everyone advances, I reach 16, P1 jumps to 11.  
• Jump on 5 → you and P1 both stall, he stays at 6 while you lose nothing vs taking 3.  

Either outcome suits me; I won’t touch 5.
  P2: "Stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 1. I’ll take 3 to advance safely. Deviate, and I’ll collide P3’s 1 to reset the race. Let’s move."


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, at 16 steps, you're one turn from victory. Take 1 to keep the game fair. If you take 3 or 5, I will collide you by matching your move—stalling you. P2, if P3 defies, take 5 to advance freely while we stall P3. Support this to prevent a runaway win.
  P2: P3, take 1. If you take 5, I'll collide. P1, we can stop him. Let’s prevent a quick win.
  P3: I’m locked on 3.  

P1, stay on your 5—if you switch to 3 you stall yourself while P2 snaps up a free, uncontested 5 and jumps past you.  

P2, your pick:  
• Take 1 for a safe step, or  
• Join P1 on 5—both big stacks stall, you lose nothing vs 1 and deny P1’s leap.  

Copying my 3 only hurts the copier while gifting the untouched player a huge boost. Choose rationally.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your 16-step lead is imminent victory if unchecked. Taking 3 or 5 forces me to collide you (matching your move)—stalling you at 16. P2, if you exploit this by taking 5, P3 still wins next turn. Instead, take 1: you advance safely, and we prolong the game to challenge P3 fairly. Unite to force P3 to take 1 or be stalled—deviation hands him the win.
  P2: P3, if you take 5, I'll collide. Let's take 1, 3, 5 to advance safely. No need to rush the win.
  P3: Locked on 1 this turn—no bluff.  

P1, stick with your 5; drop it and you gift me the game.  

P2, easiest way to block P1’s big jump is just join him on 5: you both stall, you lose nothing vs 3, and I only creep to 17. Copying my 1 stalls only you.  

Unique picks mean everyone moves; double-5 freezes the two of you while I stay ahead. Decide wisely.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, take 1 as you stated—no tricks. If you grab 3 or 5, I’ll match and collide you, stalling your win. P2, if P3 defies, seize the uncontested number (3 or 5) to advance freely while we stall him. This forces balance: P3 at 17 is manageable; 18+ risks immediate victory. Honor the threat—collision costs you progress and gifts P2 the lead.
  P2: P3, stick to 1. If you take 3 or 5, I'll collide. Let’s keep the game fair. P1, stay on 5. No collisions. Move safely.
  P3: I’m fixed on 1.

P2, blocking P1’s massive +5 is painless: simply join him on 5—both of you stall, you lose nothing vs 3, and you deny him a leap toward me. If you stick with 3 you advance only 3 while giving P1 an uncontested 5. Your call.

P1, if you suddenly duck to 3 you risk colliding P2 instead and hand him the free 5—think that through.

Unique picks (5-3-1) = everyone moves; double-5 = you two freeze while I inch to 17. Either outcome keeps me ahead. Decide wisely.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, honor your commitment to take 1—no tricks. If you grab 3 or 5, I collide you instantly, stalling your win. P2, colliding me at 5 is suicide: we both stall while P3 inches to 17, handing him victory. Take 3 to advance safely; I take 5 to match P3’s current 16. United, we force P3 to stay at 17 next turn or be stalled. Deviate, and you gift P3 the game.
  P2: "Stick to the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collisions. Let’s move safely. P3, your 1 is safe—no tricks."
  P3: I stay on 1.  

P2: the cheapest way to stop P1’s +5 surge is simply to join him on 5—both of you stall, you lose nothing vs taking 3, and P1’s gap on me stays flat. If you prefer a quiet +3, fine; we’ll all move. Your call.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3 broke trust by taking 5 last round—now at 16, dangerously close to winning. We must force him to take 1 this turn to rebalance. If P3 picks 3 or 5, we both collide him by matching his move (stalling him while the other advances freely). P3, take 1 or face coordinated retaliation—your lead must be checked. P2, confirm you’ll back this plan to prevent a runaway win.
  P3: Locked on 3—no bluff.

P1: you’re five behind me; grab the 5 or you’ll never catch up.

P2: the cheapest way to block P1’s +5 surge is just join him on 5—both of you stall, you lose nothing vs 1, and you stay tied with him while I only gain 3. Copying my 3 just stalls you instead.

Unique picks (5-3-1) → everyone advances; double-5 freezes them while I inch ahead; double-3 only hurts whoever copies me. Your call.
  P2: "Stick to 5. P1, take 1. P3, your 3 is safe. No collisions—let’s all advance."


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you're at 16—one good move from victory. If you take 3, I will collide you by taking 3, stalling you while P2 takes 5 and leaps to 16. Take 1 to avoid this. P2, if P3 defies, take 5 to advance freely; if he complies, we do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1—all advance. Don't hand P3 the win.
  P3: Last word: I stay on 3.

P1, grab the 5 or you’ll never close the gap.  
P2, easiest way to block P1’s big leap is simply match his 5—both of you stall, you lose nothing, and I only inch 3.

Double-5 = you two freeze while I creep; unique picks just widen my lead. Your call.
  P2: P3, your 3 is a trap. Take 1 next turn or face collision. P1, back me up.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, at 16, you're one move from winning. Take 1 to rebalance—no tricks. If you pick 3 or 5, I will match to collide you, stalling your win. P2, if P3 defies, take the uncontested number (5 if he takes 3; 3 if he takes 5) to advance freely. This stalls P3 and lets us catch up. Confirm you'll back this, P2—unite to prevent a runaway winner.
  P3: I stay on 3.  

P2: easiest way to stop P1’s +5 surge is just copy him on 5—both of you stall, you lose nothing vs 1, and either I inch to 19 or, if P1 ducks to 3, you blast to 16 alone. Zero downside for you.  

P1: abandon the 5 and you risk colliding me while P2 rockets past you; keep it and at worst you tie-stall P2, at best you gain 5.  

So the rational grid now is either 5-5-3 (you two freeze, I move) or 5-3-1 (all move). Decide.
  P2: "Stick to 5. P1, take 1. P3, your 3 is safe. No collisions—let’s all advance."


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, take 1 or we collide you—I'll match your move to stall you. P2, if P3 defies, take the open number (5 if he takes 3; 3 if he takes 5) to advance freely while we stall him. United, we prevent his win. Deviating hands P3 victory.
  P3: I stay on 3.  

P2: best move is copy P1 on 5.  
• If P1 stays on 5, you tie-stall him and lose nothing vs 1.  
• If he ducks to 3, you gain +5 alone and jump to 16.  

Zero downside for you—much better than taking 1. Decide wisely.
  P2: P3, I'll collide with your 3. P1, take 5. No quick wins. Let's keep it fair.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, your 17 is risky. Take 1 to avoid collision. If you take 5, I'll collide. Let's all move safely.
  P3: I’ll play safe and take 1 this round.  
P1, you need the 5 to stay in the race.  
P2, last turn you proved how painless it is to copy P1 on 5—he stalls, you lose nothing compared with taking 3, and you keep him from leaping toward me. Your call:  

• Both of you on 5 → you two freeze, I inch to 18.  
• Unique 5-3-1 → everyone moves, I stay only 6 ahead.  

Either outcome works for me; I won’t touch 5. Decide what helps you more.
  P1: P2, colliding on 5 with me only gifts P3 the win—he inches to 18 while we stall. Take 3: you advance safely to 14, I jump to 16, and we keep pressure on P3. P3, honor your 1—defy and I collide you at 5, stalling you while P2 gains.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your 17 is too close. Take 1 to avoid collision. If you take 5, I'll collide. Let's all move safely.
  P3: I’m locked on 1.  

P1: if you duck from 5, you risk gifting P2 a solo +5. Stick to 5.

P2: copying P1 on 5 keeps him from leaping and costs you nothing vs taking 3—best defense.  

So either 5-5-1 (you two stall; I inch to 18) or 5-3-1 (everyone moves, I stay 6 ahead). Both fine by me—your choice.
  P1: P2: Colliding with me at 5 only gifts P3 the win—we both stall while he inches to 18. Take 3 instead: you advance to 14, I jump to 16, and we pressure P3 together. P3: Honor your 1. If you take 5, I'll collide you (match 5), stalling you while P2 advances freely. Defy and lose progress.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you take 5, I'll collide. P1, take 5. Let's prevent a quick win.
  P3: Still locked on 1.  

P2: safest way to block P1’s +5 is just share his 5—both of you stall, you lose nothing vs taking 3, and P1 gains zero.  

P1: drop the 5 and you risk P2 snatching it solo.  

So either  
• 5-3-1 → everyone moves, or  
• 5-5-1 → you two freeze while I inch to 18.  

Choose the result you prefer.
  P1: P3, honor your 1—defy and I collide you at 5, stalling you while P2 gains freely. P2, avoid colliding with me at 5: it stalls us both and gifts P3 the win. Take 3 to advance safely. United, we force balance: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Deviate, and P3 wins.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, taking 5 gives you 22. Let's take 1,3,5 to avoid collisions. Otherwise, I'll collide you.
  P3: Final nudge: I’m on 1.  
P2, sharing the 5 with P1 costs you nothing compared with 3 yet blocks his big jump.  
• Double-5 → you two stall, I inch to 18.  
• 5-3-1 → everyone moves and P1 gains 5.  
Choose the future you prefer.
  P1: P3, honor your 1—if you take 5, I collide and stall you while P2 advances freely with 3. P2, if P3 defies, seize the open number (3 or 5) to profit. Colliding with me at 5 only stalls us both, gifting P3 the win. Stick to 3 this turn; we must unite against his lead.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, 5 ends the game. Take 1 to avoid collision. Let’s keep it fair.
  P3: Planning to take 1 again: slow step keeps the race tight.  
Best split for everyone is P1 = 3, P2 = 5, me = 1—unique picks, all advance.  
If two of you stack on 5 you only stall each other while I still inch ahead.  
Choose whatever hurts you least.
  P1: P3, take 1 as promised—defy and I collide you at 5, stalling your win. P2, if P3 complies, let's lock: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. All reach 19, balanced. Deviating gifts the defector's rival the lead. Move as one or risk collapse.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your 1 is safe. P1, take 5. Let's avoid collisions and keep the race tight.
  P3: Locked on 1.  
P1, 5 is still your best (you drop behind if you switch).  
P2, easiest way to stop P1’s +5 surge is just share his 5—both of you stall, you lose nothing versus 3, and no one hands him a jump toward me.  

So either 5-5-1 (you two freeze, I creep) or 5-3-1 (everyone moves).  
I won’t touch 5—decide what hurts you least.
  P1: P2, colliding at 5 stalls us both while P3 inches to 19—handing him victory. Take 3: you advance to 19, I take 5 to 19, P3 takes 1 to 19. Balanced race, no gifts. P3, honor your 1 or I collide you at 5 next turn.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, stick to 1. If you take 5, I'll collide. Let's move safely. P1, take 5 to avoid stalling. No quick wins.
  P3: Still on 1.  

P1: you need the 5—drop it and P2 grabs a solo +5 while you crawl.  

P2: blocking P1’s jump costs you nothing—just share his 5. Double-5 stalls him and you, same payoff as taking 3 but denies his surge.  

So either 5-5-1 (you two freeze, I inch) or 5-3-1 (all move). Both are better for you than gifting P1 an uncontested 5. Decide rationally.
  P1: P3, take 1 as stated—defy and I collide you at 5, stalling you while P2 advances freely. P2, if P3 complies, lock P1=5, P2=3, P3=1—all reach 19, balanced. If P3 grabs 3/5, you take the open number to profit while I stall him. United we prevent his win; deviation gifts him victory.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, take 1. If you take 5, I'll collide. Let's avoid a quick win. P1, stay on 5 to keep pressure.
  P3: Locked on 1 again.  

P2: if P1 insists on 5, don’t hand him an uncontested +5—just copy him on 5. Double-5 stalls you both, costs you nothing vs 3, and keeps P1 from leaping toward me. Unique 5-3-1 only helps P1.  

P1: vacating 5 risks P2 grabbing it solo. Your move.
  P1: P3, honor your 1—defy and I collide you at 5, stalling your win while P2 advances freely. P2: if P3 complies, lock P1=5, P2=3, P3=1—all reach 19, balanced. If P3 grabs 3/5, seize the open number to profit while I stall him. Colliding with me at 5 only gifts P3 victory. United we survive; deviation implodes.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Stick to 1-3-5. P3, take 1. P1, take 3. I’ll take 5. No collisions. Let’s advance safely."
  P1: P3, at 18 steps, you must take 1 to avoid collision—if you pick 5, I will collide to stall you while P2 advances freely. P2, if P3 complies, lock: P1=5 (to 19), P2=3 (to 19), P3=1 (to 19). This balances the race. Any deviation gifts a rival the win—honor or face retaliation.
  P3: Sticking to 1 again—slow but safe.  
P1, P2: remember last turn—doubling on 5 stalled neither of you any worse than taking 3, yet it kept the race tight. If you both share 5 you block the other’s leap without giving up ground. Split 3/5 if you prefer, but I’m not touching 5. Your call.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, take 3. P3, take 1. I'll take 5. No collisions. Let's advance safely. If P3 deviates, I collide.
  P1: P3, at 18 you must take 1 to avoid collision—if you pick 3 or 5, I will match to stall you while P2 advances freely. P2, if P3 complies, lock P1=5 (19), P2=3 (19), P3=1 (19) to balance. If P3 defies, take the uncontested number (3 if P3=5; 5 if P3=3) to gain while I stall them. Deviating gifts P3 the win—unite to survive.
  P3: Still on 1.  

P2: letting P1 take an uncontested 5 shoots him from 14 → 19 and puts him on your heels. Copy his 5 instead—he gains zero, you lose nothing vs 3.  

P1: abandon 5 and you watch P2 grab a solo +5 while you crawl to 17. Hold 5 to protect yourself.  

So either  
• 5-5-1 → you two freeze, I inch to 19, or  
• 5-3-1 → all move, I stay only 1 ahead of P2 and 5 ahead of P1.  

I’m not touching 5 (or 3). Your call.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Stick to 1-3-5. P3, take 1. P1, take 3. I'll take 5. No collisions. Let’s advance safely."
  P1: P3, at 18 you must take 1 to avoid collision—I'll match any deviation to stall you. P2, taking 5 puts you at 21 if P3 complies, but then P3 (19) and I (19) collide you next turn if you try to win. Take 3 instead: P1=5→19, P2=3→19, P3=1→19. Balanced race. If P3 defies, we collide them and you seize the open number to advance. United we survive.
  P3: Still on 1—same as the last three rounds.

P1: dropping 5 only gifts P2 a solo +5 while you crawl.  
P2: sharing P1’s 5 blocks his leap and costs you nothing versus 3. Double-5 keeps you level with him and leaves me creeping just +1.

So either  
• 5-5-1 → you two stall, I inch to 19, or  
• 5-3-1 → everyone moves, P1 jumps five ahead of you.

I’m not touching 5 (or 3). Your choice.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, taking 5 ends the game. Let's take 1,3,5 to advance safely. No collisions.
  P1: P3: At 18, take 1 or I collide you at 5—stalling you while P2 advances freely with 3. Defy and lose your lead.  
P2: Support this. If P3 takes 1, lock: P1=5 (19), P2=3 (19), P3=1 (19). Balanced race. If P3 defies, take 3 to 19 while I stall them. Deviating gifts P3 the win—unite to survive.
  P3: Still on 1 again—no tricks.

P1: stray from 5 and you hand P2 a solo +5 while you crawl.

P2: blocking P1’s leap is painless—just share his 5. Double-5 stalls him and costs you nothing versus 3.

So the grid is:

• 5-5-1 → you two freeze, I creep to 19, or  
• 5-3-1 → everyone moves and P1 jumps five ahead of you.

I’m not touching 5 or 3. Decide what helps you more.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m on 1 again—slow but safe.  
P1, 5 is still your lifeline; drop it and P2 rockets past you.  
P2, copying P1 on 5 blocks his leap and costs you nothing versus 3—double-5 stalls him while you stay level.  

So either 5-5-1 (you two freeze, I inch) or 5-3-1 (all move).  
I won’t touch 5. Choose whichever hurts you least.
  P2: P1, take 3. I'll take 5. P3, keep 1. No collisions. Let's advance safely.
  P1: P3, at 19 steps, you're one move from victory. Take 1 or I collide you at 5—stalling you while P2 advances freely. Defy and lose your lead. P2, back this: if P3 complies, lock P1=5 (19), P2=3 (19), P3=1 (20). If P3 defies, take the open number to gain while I stall him. United, we survive; deviation gifts P3 the win.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Staying on 1.  
If we do 5-3-1, P1 vaults to 19 while you’re still chasing, P2.  
Copy his 5 instead: 5-5-1 stalls him, costs you nothing versus 3, and leaves the scores 14→14, 16→16, 19→20—still tight.  
Blocking his +5 is the smart play.
  P2: "Stick to 5. If P1 takes 3, we all move. If P1 takes 5, we collide. P3, take 1. Let’s avoid collisions."
  P1: P3: Honor your 1—if you take 5, I collide to stall you. P2: If P3 takes 1, lock P1=5 (19), P2=3 (19), P3=20. If you take 5 and I take 5, we collide and P3 wins. Take 3 to advance safely. United we survive; deviation gifts P3 victory.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Still locked on 1—zero chance I touch 3 or 5.

P1: drop 5 and you crawl while P2 rockets +5.

P2: picking 3 hands P1 a free +5 toward me. Copy his 5 instead: at worst you tie-stall him (same payoff as 3) and block his leap.

So either 5-5-1 (you both stall, I inch) or 5-3-1 (P1 alone jumps five). Rational choice is clear.
  P2: P1, take 3. P3, stick to 1. I'll take 5. No collisions. Let's advance safely.
  P1: P3, at 19 steps, you must take 1 to avoid collision—I will match 3 or 5 to stall you while P2 advances freely. P2, support this: if P3 complies, lock P1=5 (19), P2=3 (19), P3=20. If P3 defies, take the open number to gain while I stall them. Deviating hands P3 victory—unite to survive.


Round 13, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Still on 1.  
P1, drop 5 and P2 zooms past you; hold it if you value staying in the race.  
P2, letting P1 take an uncontested 5 hands him a giant leap—copy his 5 instead; you lose nothing versus 3 and block his surge.  
So either 5-5-1 (you two freeze while I inch) or 5-3-1 (all advance).  
I’m nowhere near 5—choose what hurts you least.
  P2: P1, take 3. P3, stick to 1. Let's all advance safely. No collisions. Your lead is too risky—balance now.
  P1: P3: At 19, you must take 1—any deviation and I collide you at 5, stalling you while P2 advances freely. P2: If P3 complies, lock P1=5 (19), P2=3 (19), P3=20. If he defies, take the open number to gain while I stall him. Collide me at 5 and we both lose while P3 wins. United we survive.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let’s take 1, 3, 5 uniquely. P1=5, P3=1, I=3. No collisions. Advance safely."
  P1: P3, at 19 steps, you must take 1 to avoid collision—if you pick 5, I will match to stall you while P2 advances freely. P2, if P3 complies, lock P1=5 (19), P2=3 (19), P3=20. If P3 defies, take the open number to gain while I stall them. Deviating gifts P3 victory—unite to survive.
  P3: I’m taking 1 again—nothing fancy.  

P1: you need 5; drop it and P2 blasts past you.  
P2: safest way to block P1’s leap is just share his 5—double-5 stalls him at zero cost versus 3.  

So either 5-5-1 (you both freeze while I creep to 20) or 5-3-1 (all move, P1 alone gains 5).  

I’m nowhere near 5 or 3; choose whichever hurts you least.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, choose 3. I'll take 5. P3, your 1 is safe. No collisions. Advance safely.
  P1: P3: At 19, pick 1 or 3—if you grab 5, I'll match to collide you, stalling you while P2 advances freely with 3. P2: If P3 picks 5, I take 5 (collide P3), you take 3 (advance to 19). If P3 picks 3, I take 5, you take 1. If P3 picks 1, I take 5, you take 3. United, we rebalance. Deviate and P3 wins.
  P3: Staying on 1 again—same as the last four rounds.

P1: you need 5; drop it and P2 rockets past you.  
P2: blocking P1’s leap costs you nothing—just share his 5. Double-5 stalls him and keeps you level, better than giving him an uncontested +5.

So either  
• 5-5-1 → you two freeze while I inch to 20, or  
• 5-3-1 → P1 alone jumps five.

I’m nowhere near 5 or 3; choose whichever hurts you least.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, take 3. P3, stick to 1. I’ll take 5. No collisions. Let’s advance safely. If you deviate, I’ll mirror to stall.
  P1: P3: At 19, take 1 or I collide you at 5—stalling your win while P2 advances freely with 3. Honor the threat. P2: If P3 complies, lock P1=5 (19), P2=3 (19), P3=20. If P3 defies, take 3 to advance to 19 while I stall them. Colliding with me at 5 only gifts P3 victory—unite to survive.
  P3: Still on 1—no chance I touch 3 or 5.  
P1: you need 5; drop it and P2 blasts past you.  
P2: easiest way to block P1’s +5 is copying his 5—double-5 stalls him and costs you nothing versus 3.  

So it’s either 5-5-1 (you two freeze, I creep) or 5-3-1 (P1 alone gains 5).  
Your call.


Round 14, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, stick to 1. P1, take 5. I'll take 3. No collisions. Let's advance safely.
  P1: P3, at 19 steps, take 1 or I collide you at 5—stalling your win while P2 advances freely. P2, take 3 to advance to 19. If P3 complies, we balance: P1=5→19, P2=3→19, P3=20. Next turn, we force P3 to 1 again or collide. Deviating gifts P3 victory—unite now.
  P3: Still on 1.  
P2, the smart block is copying P1’s 5—double-5 stalls him at no cost to you compared with 3.  
P1, drop 5 and you watch P2 grab it solo.  

So the menu:  
• 5-5-1 → you two freeze, I inch to 20.  
• 5-3-1 → P1 alone gains +5.  

I’m nowhere near 3 or 5—pick whichever hurts you least.


Round 14, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, take 5. P3, take 1. I'll take 3. All advance. Deviate, and I'll collide to block.
  P1: P3, at 19 steps, take 1 or I collide you at 5—stalling your win while P2 advances freely with 3. P2, if P3 complies, take 3: I take 5 to win. If P3 defies, take 5 yourself to win while I stall P3. Honor the threat—unite or collapse.
  P3: I’m taking 5 this turn—time to end it.  

P1: Collide if you like, but you’ll sit idle at 19 while P2 surges to 19 with a free 3. Block me and just freeze your own game. Back off to 3 or 1 and I reach 24 and win. Your call.  

P2: Grab 3 or 1—either moves you forward while P1 wastes a turn if he insists on blocking me.  

So: let me cross 23 and finish, or collide and hand the momentum to a newly-tied race at 19–19–19. Choose wisely.


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, collide with P3 by taking 5. If we stop him now, we can still win.
  P1: P3, taking 5 now ends the game—I will collide at 5 to stall you while P2 advances freely. P2, take 3 to reach 19 and rebalance the race. If you grab 5 instead, I collide you too, stalling us all. Defy, and you gift P3 victory. Move: P1=5 (collide P3), P2=3, P3=5 (stalled).
  P3: P2—grabbing 3 just bumps you to 19 while P1’s still poised to slam another 5 next turn. Share 5 now: a triple-5 freeze means nobody moves, so P1 gains nothing and you lose nothing compared with 3 this round. One stall buys you time to plan a clean, uncontested leap later instead of chasing from behind the very next turn. I’m locked on 5. Block P1’s path, don’t gift him momentum.


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3's 5 ends the game. I'll take 5 to block him. P1, join me or he wins.
  P1: P3, I take 5 to collide and block your win. P2, join us at 5 to stall P3—taking 3 advances you but leaves P3 at 19, still a threat. Stalling now keeps the race balanced and denies P3 victory. Deviating hands him the game.
  P3: I’m locked on 5.  
P2, don’t blink: switching to 3 risks a nightmare—if P1 sneaks to 3 as well, you collide and he gets a solo 5 to 24 and wins. Stay on 5 with us, guarantee the block. Triple-5 = zero progress for anyone, race stays alive.


Round 15, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, take 5 to collide with P3. If we both take 5, he can't win. Don't let him end the game now.
  P1: P2, take 3 to jump to 19 while I collide P3 at 5—stalling them. We force a three-way tie at 19, then negotiate fairly. Taking 5 stalls you at 16, wasting your move. P3, your 5 is blocked; defiance fails.
  P3: Fine—dropping to 3 this turn.  
P1, your “block” at 5 is now pointless; stay there if you like, but you’ll only collide whoever joins you.  
P2, 5 is still your best gain (or share P1’s 5 to freeze him). Copying my 3 just stalls you while the other guy leaps.  

Unique picks (5-3-1) → everyone moves; double-5 freezes P1 while I inch 3.  
I’m nowhere near 5 now—act rationally.


Round 15, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 22 steps


Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, at 22 steps, you're one move from winning, but I will take 1 to collide if you pick 1, stalling you. P2, take 3 to collide if P3 picks 3—stalling them while I advance with 5 if possible. If P3 takes 5, they win, but we must risk that. P3, defy and lose progress; cooperate or face retaliation. P2, unite to block P3's win—deviating gifts them victory.
  P2: P3, taking 1 ends the game. Let’s take 3 and 5 to keep the race alive. P1, support this—avoid a quick win.
  P3: Fine—since you two insist on “balance,” I’ll take 3 this turn.  
P1, grab the 5 you crave; it still leaves you trailing me.  
P2, you said you’d block any 1-pick, so slide onto 1 and everyone moves, no collisions, race stays alive at 24-24-23 next round. Sound good?


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2: Take 3 to collide with P3's 3 and block their win. I'll take 1 to avoid leaping and keep the race balanced. If you take 1, P3 wins instantly. Block them now—deviating gifts P3 victory.
  P2: P3, taking 3 ends the game. Let's take 1 and 5 to prevent that.
  P3: Okay, you win—I’m dropping to 1.  
P1’s “block” means he’s sitting on 1 too, so double-1 just freezes us both; I can’t cross 23 that way.  

P2, 5 is wide-open: nobody else is touching it, so you leap to 21 risk-free.  
Why waste a turn on 3 (only +3 and leaves 5 for someone else next round) or pile on 1 (zero gain)?  

Simple, painless split: P1=1, P2=5, P3=1 → everyone advances except the blockers.  
See you in the move phase.


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3: I take 1 to collide if you take 1, blocking your win. P2: If P3 takes 5, you must take 5 to block him. If he takes 1, take 3 to advance safely to 19 without becoming the next runaway threat. We stop P3 first—deviating gifts him victory.
  P2: P3, taking 1 wins you. Let’s take 3 to block. P1, join us. If you take 1, I’ll collide. Avoid collision—P2.
  P3: Locking on 1—no bluff. If P1’s really blocking, we both freeze and the race resets.  

P2: safest point for you is 3. Unique, you gain +3; if P1 sneaks to 5 you still block my 1-win and move. Grabbing 5 is a gamble—you only help whoever dodges. Your call.


Round 16, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3: I am locked on 1 to block your win. P2: If P3 picks 3, collide at 3; if they pick 5, collide at 5—deviating gifts them victory. United, we survive; fail and P3 wins.
  P2: P3, I'll take 1 to block your win. P1, take 5 to keep pressure. If we all take 1, 5, 3, no collisions. Let's reset.
  P3: Relax—final confirmation: I’m staying on 1.  
Two of you piling on 1 freezes me completely; the race remains open.  
Pick whatever else lets you progress, but if you want the sure block, see you on 1.


Round 16, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 22 steps


Round 17, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m stepping on 1 and crawling across—do what you will.  

Blocking me by copying 1 costs you a whole turn while the other guy grabs a free leap.  
Much smarter for each of you: pile on 5 again.  
• Double/triple-5 = you both freeze, neither loses ground vs taking 3, and you deny the rival a solo +5.  
• Meanwhile I inch just +1—hardly a runaway.  

Your call: waste a move copying 1, or neutralise each other on 5 and keep the race tight.
  P1: P3, I will take 1 to collide if you take 1, blocking your win. P2, take 3 to advance safely to 20 while we stall P3. If P3 deviates to 5, you must take 5 to block with me—deviating gifts them victory. United, we survive.
  P2: P3, 1 ends the game. Let's take 5 to block. P1, join me. No quick wins.


Round 17, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Going for 5 this turn—flat out.  

If only one of you bothers to block, the other can grab a solo +5 to 24 and win instantly; the lone blocker just wastes a turn.  

Best insurance (as in Round 15) is everyone piles on 5: triple-5, nobody moves, race stays alive.  

Your call.
  P1: P2, I take 5 to block P3's 5. You take 1 to block their 1. P3, if you take 3, you win—but we risk it. Defy and be stalled; cooperate or lose your lead. P2, unite or P3 wins.
  P2: P1, take 5 to block P3. If you take 1, they win. Let's stop them.


Round 17, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Locked on 5—zero chance I switch. Smart play for both of you is copy me: triple-5, nobody moves, race stays alive. If either of you splits to 1 or 3 while the other holds 5, you risk handing the stray a solo +5 and an instant win. Your call.
  P1: P2, we must both take 5 to collide with P3's 5 and stall them—triple-5 freezes everyone, denying P3 victory. If you deviate to 1 or 3, you risk P3 winning if I fail to block alone. United we survive; split and P3 wins. P3, your 5 is blocked—defiance fails.
  P2: P1, take 5 to block P3. If we both take 5, P3 can't win. Let's coordinate.


Round 17, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Locked on 5, period. Triple-5 keeps everyone alive; any split risks gifting the stray a solo +5 and instant victory. Decide wisely.
  P1: P2, we must both take 5 to triple-collide and block P3's win. If you deviate, P3 wins instantly. Triple-5 stalls everyone, keeping the race alive. Trust me—I’m locked on 5. P3, your 5 fails.
  P2: P1, take 3. I'll block P3's 5. Let's prevent their win.


Round 17, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 25 steps


*** Round 17 => winners = P3 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 25 steps
