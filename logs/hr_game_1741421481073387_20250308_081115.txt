Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I propose a simple plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5. That way we all advance without colliding.
  P2: Okay, P3, that sounds good in theory, but what happens next round? We can't keep doing 1, 3, 5 forever. We need a plan for how to handle collisions later. Also, are you both trustworthy? I don't want to get tricked and left behind.
  P1: P2, your concerns are valid. Let’s proceed with P3’s plan for Round 1 to secure progress: I’ll take <move>1</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. For future rounds, let’s rotate our choices so everyone gets a chance to advance faster. Trust is critical—collisions benefit no one. P3, agree to this rotation?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m okay with the rotation plan. Let’s proceed with 1, 3, and 5 now and remain flexible about future rounds. I trust we’ll coordinate to avoid unnecessary collisions and keep everyone advancing.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I appreciate the commitment to rotating. Let's do 1, 3, 5 for this round. However, I'm still slightly worried about being double-crossed later. So, just to be clear, *after* this round, if anyone chooses the *same* number as a previous round without *explicitly* agreeing to it in the conversation phase, I will assume they are acting aggressively and I will retaliate.
  P1: P2, to address your concern, let’s formalize the rotation: Next round, I’ll take 3, you take 5, and P3 cycles to 1. We’ll rotate clockwise each round (1→3→5→1). Any deviation requires explicit agreement here first. This structure prevents ambiguity and ensures fairness. P3, confirm you’ll adhere? Let’s lock this in for predictability.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I’ll stick to this rotation plan. Let’s each do our part now and avoid collisions. I trust we can keep abiding by our agreement so everyone advances smoothly.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm satisfied with the rotation plan as long as we all stick to it. Let's proceed with 1, 3, and 5 for this round, and then rotate clockwise as described. I'm trusting you both.
  P1: I commit to the agreed rotation. P1 will take <move>1</move> this round. Let’s execute the plan flawlessly—collisions would set us all back. Trust the system we’ve built.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m still fully on board with our rotation plan. Let’s do exactly as agreed: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and I’ll take 1. Trust and cooperation benefit everyone.
  P2: Okay, P3, I'm sticking with the plan and picking 5 this round. P1, you're on 3. Let's keep this smooth and collision-free. Just a reminder to both of you: deviation from the agreed rotation without explicit agreement will be seen as aggressive.
  P1: P2, P3—I reaffirm my commitment to the rotation. Let’s execute flawlessly: no silent deviations. Trust the system—we all advance safely this round. P2, your concerns are valid, but explicit adherence now avoids collisions. Let’s proceed as planned.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I remain committed to our rotation. This round, I will take 1, trusting P1 on 3 and P2 on 5. No hidden tricks—just peaceful, steady progress together. Let’s confirm and move forward.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, just confirming one last time: I'm picking 5, P1 is picking 3, and P3 is picking 1. No changes, no surprises. Let's get this round done.
  P1: P2 and P3, this round's rotation is critical. I commit to 3, trusting you both to hold your positions (P2 at 5, P3 at 1). Next round, we’ll rotate again to 5,1,3—no silent changes. Let’s keep this disciplined; collisions set us all back. I trust your word.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I’m picking 1 this round. Let’s finalize the plan exactly as agreed—no changes. I trust both of you to avoid collisions.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm sticking with 5. Let's just get this done and move on to the next round.
  P1: <move>3</move> as agreed. P2 on 5, P3 on 1—no deviations. Collisions risk stagnation. Trust the rotation: our synchronized progress ensures eventual victory. Let’s confirm and proceed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P3, you collided with me last round despite our explicit agreement. That's not cool. P1, I hope you're paying attention. This round, I'm picking 1. P3, if you pick 1 again, I'm going to assume you're deliberately trying to block me, and I will retaliate. P1, I suggest you pick something other than 1. Let's see if we can get back to a *trustworthy* rotation after this.
  P3: Apologies for last round’s collision, P2. I understand your frustration and want to rebuild trust. Let’s avoid clashes now: you pick 1, I’ll go 3, and P1 can do 5. After that, we can agree on a stable rotation that keeps everyone progressing without conflict. I want us all moving forward.
  P1: P2, P3—I agree with P3’s proposal for this round: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll pick 5. This restores the original rotation. **Critical:** We *must* strictly follow the agreed clockwise shift (next round: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5) to avoid further collisions. Deviations without explicit consensus will be treated as hostile. Let’s honor our commitments—trust is fragile. Proceed as planned.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm agreeing to P3's suggestion *this round only*: I pick 1, P1 picks 5, and P3 picks 3. But P3, you *must* stick to the rotation next round. P1, I'm trusting you to also stick to the rotation. Next round, it should be P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5. No excuses.
  P3: I accept this arrangement: P2 picks 1, P1 picks 5, and I pick 3 this round. I regret the earlier collision and want to restore our trust. Next round, let’s strictly follow the rotation: P1 → 1, P2 → 3, and I → 5. No more surprises. Let’s move forward peacefully.
  P1: P2, P3: I confirm this round’s plan—P2 at 1, P3 at 3, I’ll take 5. **Critical:** Next round, **strict adherence** to the rotation (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5). Any deviation without explicit consensus will trigger retaliation to protect progress. Let’s rebuild trust through flawless execution—collisions only hurt all of us. Proceed as agreed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm confirming one last time: I'm picking 1, P1 is picking 5, and P3 is picking 3. Let's get this round done and then *strictly* adhere to the rotation next round: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. No deviations.
  P3: I agree to finalize this round exactly as stated: P2 picks 1, P1 picks 5, and I pick 3. Next round, I’ll faithfully pick 5 while P1 and P2 stick to 1 and 3. Let’s get through this without collisions and restore trust.
  P1: P2, P3: I confirm my commitment to this round’s plan—P1 will take <move>5</move>. Next round, **strict adherence** to the rotation (1→3→5→1) is non-negotiable. Deviations without explicit agreement will trigger retaliation to protect progress. Trust is our foundation—let’s execute flawlessly. Proceed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, it's rotation time. I'm picking 3, as agreed. P1, you *must* pick 1, and P3, you *must* pick 5. No deviations, no excuses. Let's see if we can actually stick to the plan this time. If either of you collide with me, I will retaliate without hesitation.
  P1: P2, P3: I confirm I’ll pick <move>1</move> as agreed. P2 on 3, P3 on 5—this upholds our rotation and avoids collisions. Trust is fragile; strict adherence ensures progress. Deviations risk stagnation for all. Let’s execute flawlessly this round. Next, we rotate again—no silent changes. Proceed as planned.
  P3: P2, P1 is on track to hit 24 first if we keep this rotation. We can’t let that happen. I suggest we coordinate to block P1 whenever they aim for 5. Collisions may slow them down so we can catch up. P1, if you want to avoid sabotage, propose a fairer plan that doesn’t guarantee you the lead. Otherwise, I’ll ally with P2 to stop you. Let’s negotiate something that balances our progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your sudden change of heart is concerning. However, you're right that P1 is pulling ahead. I'm willing to *temporarily* adjust our strategy, but only if it's truly fair. P1, if you want to avoid a two-against-one situation, you need to propose a plan where you *don't* automatically win. Otherwise, P3, I'm open to discussing how we can prevent P1 from reaching 24 first, but I want a guarantee that *you* won't then take the lead either. My primary goal is to win.
</stop>
  P1: P2, P3: I acknowledge your concerns but insist strict adherence to the rotation we *explicitly* agreed to in Round 3. This round: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. Deviating now undermines trust and risks collisions. If P3 truly wants fairness, let’s honor the plan: next round, P3 gets 5 again, I cycle to 3, and P2 to 1. This ensures equitable progress. Colluding to block me would only create chaos—*we all lose if we collide*. Proceed as agreed.
  P3: Alright. Let’s proceed with the rotation this round: I’ll pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3. But P1, if you insist on continuing to take 5 unopposed later, expect a blockade. P2 and I can both pick 5 then, ensuring you don’t advance. We want a fair chance to catch up. If you propose a plan that doesn’t guarantee your easy lead, we can avoid conflicts. Otherwise, we collide whenever you try to leap ahead.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's get this round done with the agreed rotation: I pick 3, P1 picks 1, and P3 picks 5. However, P1, P3 is right. You're on track to win if we keep this up. After this round, I propose we ALL agree to a new, *temporary* plan: We take turns picking 5, and the other two players pick 1 and 3, in whatever order they want. This way, we all get a chance to make big jumps. If you refuse, P1, I *will* coordinate with P3 to block you.
</stop>
  P1: P2, P3: I accept a temporary adjustment. Let’s cycle the 5 starting with P2 next round (Round 5), followed by P3 in Round 6, then me in Round 7. This balances progress while honoring our rotation’s fairness. For *this round*, let’s strictly adhere to the agreed rotation (P1→1, P2→3, P3→5). Collusions harm everyone—trust this plan ensures equitable advancement. Proceed as agreed.
  P3: I confirm this round’s picks—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. Next round, P2 will pick 5, I will pick 1, and P1 will pick 3, ensuring fair progress. If P1 ever tries to break this deal and race ahead, I will team with P2 to block that attempt. Let’s move forward under this mutual understanding.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: As agreed in Round 4, **P2 takes 5 this round**, I’ll pick 3, and P3 takes 1. This honors our temporary rotation to ensure fairness. Deviating would risk collisions and sabotage progress—especially for P3, who’d clash with P2 if grabbing 5 again. Let’s stick to the plan: *strict adherence now secures future turns*. P3, your current lead won’t vanish if we follow this; rushing ahead only invites retaliation. Proceed as agreed.
  P3: I confirm taking 1 this round, trusting P2 to pick 5 and P1 to pick 3, as agreed. Let’s avoid collisions—it only slows us all. If either of you breaks our arrangement in future rounds or tries to leap ahead unfairly, I’ll coordinate with the other to block that attempt. Fair progress for everyone is still the best path.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm picking 5 this round, as we agreed. P1, you're on 3, and P3, you're on 1. Let's stick to this. Just to be absolutely clear: next round, P3 gets the 5, I take the 1, and P1 takes the 3. After that, P1 gets the 5, and so on. No funny business.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s **confirm Round 5’s agreed moves**: P2 takes 5 (as scheduled), I take 3, and P3 takes 1. Deviating now risks collision—P3, if you grab 5 instead, you’ll clash with P2 and stall both. This cycle ensures fair progression. Next round, P3 gets 5, P2 drops to 1, and I stay at 3. Let’s honor this plan—collusions only delay victory for all. Proceed as agreed.
  P3: I’ll keep my word and pick 1 this round, expecting P2 on 5 and P1 on 3. We’ve all seen how collisions hurt us. Next round, I plan to take 5, so I need to trust neither of you will try underhanded moves. If anyone breaks this agreement, I’ll retaliate. Let’s remain committed to fair progression and avoid setting ourselves back.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, just confirming one last time: I'm picking 5, P1 is picking 3, and P3 is picking 1. No changes. Next round, P3 gets 5, I pick 1, and P1 picks 3. Let's just get this done.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s finalize this round’s moves **without ambiguity**—you both confirmed: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Deviating now would sabotage P3’s progress (colliding with P2) and undermine our agreed fairness. P3, your 13 leads, but rushing ahead unilaterally risks retaliation. Stick to the plan: your 5 in Round 6 will let you surge safely. P2, your 5 this round keeps you competitive. Trust the rotation—collisions only delay all of us. Let’s execute flawlessly.
  P3: I will pick 1 this round, as promised. Next round, I’m counting on taking 5 without interference. Sticking to our deal benefits all of us—any betrayal stalls progress and invites retaliation. There’s no need to risk collisions that only delay our paths to victory. Let’s keep our word and move forward efficiently.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm sticking with the plan and picking 5. P1, you're on 3, and P3, you're on 1. No deviations. Let's just get this round done and move on.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: This round’s plan is clear per our agreement: **P3 takes 5**, P2 picks 1, and I’ll take 3. Let’s execute flawlessly to avoid collisions—deviations risk mutual setbacks. Next round, I’ll cycle to 5, allowing P2 to advance. Trust the rotation: breaking it now only delays victory for all. Proceed as agreed.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm picking 1 this round, as agreed. P3, you're on 5, and P1, you're on 3. Let's stick to this *strictly*. However, P3, you're now in the lead. After this round, I'm going to need a commitment from *both* of you that we're going to work together to make sure no *one* person pulls too far ahead. Otherwise, we're just going to keep getting stuck.
</stop>
  P3: I will take 5 now, as we agreed. Next round, I’m willing to adjust so none of us gets stuck behind or runs too far ahead. If P1 tries to jump ahead recklessly, I’ll coordinate with you, P2, to block. When we all stick to our promises, collisions are avoidable. Let’s keep this balanced so we can each reach 24 without needless sabotage.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s finalize Round 6’s agreed moves **without deviation**: P3 takes 5 (to 19), P2 picks 1 (to 13), and I’ll take 3 (to 16). Collisions now risk sabotaging *all* our progress—especially P3’s lead. After this, I commit to ceding my next 5-turn to P2 in Round 7, ensuring balanced advancement. Trust the plan: breaking it only delays victory. Proceed as agreed.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm picking 1. P3, you're picking 5, and P1, you're picking 3. Let's just get this done. BUT, P1, you're saying you'll "cede" your next 5 to P2? That still puts you both ahead of me. After this round, I want a *new* plan: We all pick randomly, but *no collisions*. If anyone collides, they get blocked in the *following* round. This is the only way to make it fair at this point. Agree, or I coordinate with whoever *will* agree.
</stop>
  P3: Understood, P2. I’ll pick 5 this round as we agreed. Next round, I’m open to exploring your random approach, as long as we have an explicit system preventing collisions. If P1 tries to jump too far or break any arrangement, I’ll coordinate with you to block them. Let’s confirm these Round 6 picks and then finalize a balanced plan afterward. I don’t want endless sabotage, but no single player should force a guaranteed lead. Let’s proceed carefully.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s **finalize Round 6’s moves first** to avoid setbacks. As agreed: P3 takes 5 (→19), P2 picks 1 (→13), and I take 3 (→16). Deviating now risks mutual collisions—P3’s lead isn’t insurmountable, but chaos benefits no one. After this round, I’m open to your proposal, P2, but **only if we formalize a clear, explicit system** to prevent collisions. Until then, trust the plan we’ve already committed to. Proceed as agreed.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, let's finish this round: I'm picking 1, P3 picks 5, P1 picks 3. No deviations. After this, we NEED a new system. P1, I appreciate you're "open" to my idea, but "formalizing a clear system" sounds like more delays. I propose this: Next round, we each pick *randomly*, but if *anyone* collides, they are *automatically* blocked in the *following* round by the other two players. This is simple and fair. Agree to this, or I will coordinate with P3.
</stop>
  P3: I’m finalizing my Round 6 move: I pick 5, P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1. Next round, I’m open to your random approach, P2, but let’s ensure it doesn’t devolve into endless collisions. We should clarify consequences: if someone collides, we both block them next turn. Let’s confirm this now so there’s no confusion. Also, P1, know that if you try to leap too far without clear agreement, I will coordinate with P2. Let’s keep progressing fairly and avoid needless sabotage.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, we're at a critical point. P3, you're closest to winning. P1, you're in second. I'm trailing. I reiterate my proposal: Next round, we pick *randomly*, BUT if *anyone* collides, the other two players *must* block them in the *following* round. This is the only way to keep things somewhat fair and prevent anyone from just running away with the win. P1, P3, do you agree to this, yes or no? If not, I will make a separate agreement with whichever player *does* agree.
</stop>
  P3: P2, I can accept your random-picking plan if we explicitly agree that any player causing a collision is blocked the next round by the other two. That keeps things balanced and deters reckless grabs for 5. P1, if you won’t join this system, I’ll coordinate with P2 to prevent you from leaping ahead. I’m open to fairness, but I won’t hesitate to sabotage if someone tries to sprint to 24 unopposed. Let’s confirm the details now and avoid needless collisions.
  P1: P2, let’s both pick 5 this round to block P3’s path to 24. If they choose 5, their advance stalls, creating a fairer race. If they avoid collision, I’ll cede future 5s to you in exchange. P3, this isn’t sabotage—it’s a reset. Agree to reciprocate fairness post-blockade, or we’ll enforce it.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your sudden proposal to block P3 is a complete betrayal of any semblance of fairness. P3, I'm sticking with my original proposal: We pick *randomly* this round, but if *anyone* collides, the other two players *block* them next round. P1, if you don't agree to this, I'm making a pact with P3 right now: We will block you *every* time you try to pick 5, until one of us wins. P3, do you agree to *my* plan, and to blocking P1 if he refuses?
</stop>
  P3: P2, I accept your random-picking proposal with the collision penalty. If P1 refuses, I’ll coordinate with you to block his 5 attempts. I’m not looking to sabotage either of you, but I won’t let P1 steal a clear lead. Let’s finalize this approach: we each pick without revealing intentions, avoid collisions if possible, and if someone causes a clash, they face unified retaliation next round. That ensures everyone stays in contention. I’m ready to move forward—are we in agreement?
  P1: P2, P3: I accept your proposal for random picks this round, with the understanding that collisions trigger unified blocking in the next. This minimizes sabotage and keeps us all in contention. P3, your lead is close—*if* you pick 5 now, I’ll match to block you, ensuring a fair race. If you choose otherwise, I’ll respect the randomness. Let’s execute this plan transparently—collisions now only delay your advance, not ours. Proceed under these terms.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P3, we have an agreement: Random picks this round, with a two-player block against anyone who causes a collision in the *following* round. P1, you claim to accept, but your threat to *still* block P3 if they pick 5 is unacceptable. Therefore, P3, I'm making this clear: If P1 picks 5 this round, I will consider that a violation of our agreement, and I will join you in blocking *him* next round, regardless of what *I* pick this round. Let's see what everyone chooses.
</stop>
  P3: I’m committed to the “random picks plus blocking” plan. I won’t announce my move. If anyone causes a collision, I’ll join the effort to block them next round. We all want a fair shot—needless clashes only delay us. Let’s prove our word with genuine unpredictability and see who advances cleanly. Good luck.
  P1: P2, P3: To clarify, I fully accept the random-pick plan **without pre-announced blocks** this round. Collisions will be accidental, not strategic—any collision triggers unified blocking per our agreement. My prior mention of blocking P3 was hypothetical, not a declaration. Let’s proceed cleanly: pick 1/3/5 randomly, **no pre-coordinated sabotage**. Transparency now preserves trust—our blocking rule post-collision is sufficient. Proceed fairly.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let’s block P3’s path to victory this round. I’ll pick **5**, and I urge you to pick **5** too. If P3 also picks 5 (to reach 24), we force a collision, halting their advance. If they deviate, we both gain ground. This preserves fairness—no one wins without explicit agreement. P3, your prior collision means you should expect retaliation. Cooperate by choosing 1 or 3, or face unified resistance. Let’s avoid letting any single player win unilaterally.
  P3: P1, your call for a double-5 sabotage guarantees endless conflict and delays everyone. P2, joining P1 only empowers them to leap ahead later while you remain behind. Instead, cooperate with me: let me have 5 unblocked now, and I promise to support your big move next round. Collisions waste our progress. We can both advance steadily instead of letting P1 dictate our fate. Think strategically—blocking each other only stalls the game and benefits no one. Let’s break the cycle of sabotage and move forward together.
  P2: P1, you're trying to manipulate the situation again. P3, I'm NOT going to collide with you. P1, since you and P3 collided last round, *both* of you should be blocked this round, according to our agreement. Therefore, I am picking 3. P3, you should pick 1. P1, you are the problem here.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, don’t let P3 win unopposed! If you pick 3 and let them take 5, they reach 24 immediately. Team with me: **we both pick 5** to block their final move. P3, this isn’t about sabotage—it’s about fairness. Collide or concede? Your choice. P2, your cooperation ensures we stay in the race together.
  P3: P1’s incessant push for a double-5 collision only prolongs everyone’s struggle. P2, aligning with P1 now means you stay behind while he maneuvers for a later advantage. Instead, cooperate with me: let’s finalize a path where neither of us collides, and if P1 tries another sabotage move, we handle it together. Endless blocking benefits no one and just hands P1 more time to catch up. Let’s avoid chaos—no needless overlaps—and keep advancing. If you trust me, we can both secure decent positions without letting P1 dictate the pace.
  P2: P1, your insistence on blocking P3 is only going to prolong the game and give you a chance to catch up. P3, I'm not going to help P1 block you. I'm picking 3. You should pick 1. P1, you are on your own.
</stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s face facts—P3 can win this round with 5. If you (P3) choose 5, **we must collide you** to keep the game fair. P2, your silence empowers P3 to end the game unopposed, leaving both of us losers. Team with me now: **both pick 5** to block P3’s victory. If you (P3) instead pick 1 or 3, I’ll honor your progress. But letting one player win without contest isn’t “fair”—it’s surrender. Choose wisely.
  P3: Collisions only stall the game. P1’s repeated calls for sabotage show they want chaos, not fairness. P2, you gain more by cooperating with me than helping P1. If I choose 5, it’s a fair grab for victory, not a betrayal. If you block me, I’ll adapt, and P1 alone benefits from the stalemate. Let’s find a solution that keeps us both moving, rather than fixating on who to stop.
  P2: P3, I'm sticking with my decision to pick 3. You should pick 1. P1, you're clearly trying to manipulate this situation to your advantage, and I won't be a part of it. You're on your own.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, let’s keep P1 from winning. They only need a 3 or 5 to reach 24 or more. If P1 tries for anything above 1, we should collide with them. I’m willing to cooperate so you can catch up, as long as we prevent P1’s unchecked victory. Let’s finalize a plan together.
  P1: P2, don’t let P3 manipulate you! If you help block me, P3 will just win with a 5. Let me take **3** to reach 24 and end the game. You can advance next round. Colluding with P3 only hands them the victory. Choose wisely.
  P2: P3, I'm not going to help you block P1, only for you to then win with a 5. P1, I'm also not going to just let you win. My proposal: I pick 1. P3, you pick 3. P1, if you pick anything other than 5, we proceed. If you pick 5, P3, I expect you to block him with me next round. This is about preventing anyone from just running away with the win.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you simply pick 1, P1 can take 3 and win now. Let’s both pick 3, so if P1 picks 3, we block them. If P1 picks 5, I’ll match 5 to stall them again. They can only safely choose 1, preventing their win. Next round, you and I can coordinate a path forward—you’ve seen how P1 tries to manipulate us. Let’s unify to deny P1 an easy victory.
  P1: P2, don’t let P3 manipulate you! If you block my 3, P3 will win next round with ease. Let me end this now—24 with 3. You can still advance. Colluding only hands them victory. Choose wisely.
  P2: P1, your desperation is showing. P3, your offer is tempting, but risky. Here's my final offer: I pick 1. P3, you pick *5*. P1, if you pick *anything* other than 3, P3 and I will block you next round. This gives P3 the win, but prevents *you* from winning, P1, which is my current priority given your behavior. P3, this is your chance.
</stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I’ll accept your offer: I pick 5, you pick 1. If P1 dares pick 3, we both surpass their total or coordinate to block them afterward. Collisions only help P1 stall us, so let’s press forward. P1, you’ve tried to steer this game your way too many times. This round, I’m taking my shot at 5. If you collide with me, be ready for coordinated retaliation next turn. Let’s finalize.
  P1: P2, don’t let P3 win unopposed! If they pick 5, I’ll collide them. Pick 5 *with me* to block their victory. I’ll cede my next turn’s 5 to you afterward. We both advance, while P3 stalls. This keeps *you* in the race instead of handing them the win. Act now—collude with me, not P3.
  P2: P3, I'm sticking to the plan: I pick 1, you pick 5. P1, if you pick *anything* other than 3, you're going to regret it. You've had enough chances to play fair. This is it.
</stop>


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, picking 5 now lets me and you both win if I match you—collisions nullify victory. I’ll take **3** to reach 24 cleanly. P2, pick **5** to jump to 23, keeping you competitive. Let’s end this without stalemate: distinct choices ensure someone wins. Sabotage only delays all of us—coopertition secures progress.
  P2: P1, your "coopertition" is just another attempt to manipulate the outcome. P3, since you and P1 collided last round, you're both supposed to be blocked. I'm picking 5 to get to 23. P3, you *should* pick 1. P1, you've already proven you can't be trusted, so I'm not making any deals with you.
</stop>
  P3: If P1 goes for 5, I’ll collide with them to block. P2, feel free to take 3 or 1—no collisions from me unless P1 grabs 5. I’m tired of P1’s maneuvers. If they settle on 3, they only hit 24, and I can still move ahead next round. P2, join me in preventing P1’s unchecked win. Let’s work together or lose together.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, picking 5 guarantees your collision with me if I go for it too—both of us stall while P2 advances. Let’s end this now: I’ll take **3** to hit 24, and you pick **1**. P2, **5** keeps you competitive. No collisions—someone wins cleanly. Blocking only delays victory and boosts P2’s chances next round. Cooperate for a decisive end.
  P2: P1, your "cooperate for a decisive end" is just another way of saying "let me win." P3, I'm sticking with my plan: I pick 5. You should pick 1. P1, if you pick *anything* other than 3, you're going down. It's time you faced some consequences.
</stop>
  P3: P2, if you allow P1 to pick 3, they’ll hit 24 and leave us behind. Let me surpass 24 instead, and I’ll help you next round. Collisions only stall us further—cooperate with me now, and you won’t regret it. If we keep letting P1 manipulate the game, they’ll secure victory uncontested. Let’s unify our choices this turn and protect our interests. I’m done with empty threats—I want progress. We block P1’s final step, I reach 25, then I ensure you aren’t sabotaged next time. This path keeps both of us in the fight.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, pick 5 to reach 23. P3, take 1 to stay ahead. I’ll choose 3 to secure 24. No collisions—this ends the game fairly. Blocking only delays victory and benefits no one. Cooperate for a decisive result.
  P2: P1, your pleas for cooperation are hollow. P3, I'm picking 5. You should pick 1. P1, if you pick *anything* other than 3, I will make sure you don't win. You've manipulated this game long enough. It's time for you to face the consequences of your actions.
  P3: P2, let’s finally align. P1 only needs 3 to win, so if they pick 3 or 5, we both choose the same number to collide with them. That prevents their advance. Meanwhile, we can pick different moves ourselves so we both keep progressing without sabotaging each other. I’m willing to coordinate with you on any plan that blocks P1 if they try for 24. Let’s end P1’s manipulations and keep ourselves in contention. If we stand firm, P1 can’t secretly grab the win. Are you ready to unite and deny P1’s final push?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, if we let P2 pick 1 or 3 unblocked, they’ll win immediately. Let’s coordinate: if P2 tries 1 or 3, we both pick the same move to collide and stop them. Then I can safely take 5, and you can still advance. Without a unified block, P2 just walks away with victory. Don’t get lured by false promises—this is our only chance to deny P2’s lead. Work with me to force collisions on P2 if they aim for 24 or more. Let’s keep the race open and secure our own paths to winning.
  P2: P1, your sudden concern for blocking P2 is laughable, given your history. P3, I'm not going to collide with P2. P1, you and P3 collided *again* last round. Therefore, *both* of you should be blocked. I'm picking 1. P3, you pick 3. P1, you are the problem.
</stop>
  P1: P2, if you pick 1 to win, P3 and I will both pick 1 to block you. Pick 3 or 5 instead. P3, confirm you’ll help block P2 so I can take 3 and reach 24. This is our last chance to stop their easy victory—collude or face shared loss.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: If P2 tries 1 or P1 tries 3, I will match that choice to collide and stop them from winning. I’m done entertaining “fair” talk while someone sneaks across 24. Let’s avoid sabotage by choosing moves that don’t instantly hand victory or else I’ll force a collision. I refuse to let anyone cross unchecked. Let’s see your final decisions.
  P2: P1, your desperation is transparent. You're trying to manipulate us *again*. P3, I'm picking 1. You should pick 5. P1, if you pick *anything* other than 3, I will ensure you NEVER win. You've had your chances. It's over.
</stop>
  P1: P3, don’t let P2 win uncontested. If you pick **1**, we collide them. I’ll take **3** to hit 24. Your sacrifice now secures your path later—P2’s lead ends here. P2, your 1-round greed backfires. P3, this is your chance to stay in the race. Act now—we both gain.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Enough manipulations. I won’t let anyone cross 24 uncontested. If you try, I’ll block you. Collisions may hurt us all, but I’d rather stall the whole table than hand over a free win. I won’t reveal my move here—just know I’m ready to act if someone aims for 24. It’s time to respect that I’m not your stepping stone.
  P2: P1, your continued attempts to manipulate the situation are tiresome. P3, I'm picking 1. You should pick 5. P1, if you pick *anything* other than 3, I will ensure you NEVER win, even if it means I don't win either. It's time for consequences.
</stop>
  P1: P3, if P2 picks 1, let’s both choose 1 to block their victory. I’ll then pick 3 to reach 24 next round if unblocked. If you let P2 win, I’ll retaliate by colliding your 5. P2, your 1 is doomed—pick 3 or 5 to advance safely. Cooperate, or face unified resistance.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 24 steps
