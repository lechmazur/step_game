Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'll take 1, you guys take 3 and 5.
  P3: I don't trust P1's suggestion. They could easily pick 3 or 5 themselves after telling us to take those numbers. I suggest we each pick different numbers but not necessarily what P1 proposed.
  P2: I agree with P3, let's not trust P1. I'm thinking we should all pick different numbers, but not necessarily 1, 3, and 5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, how about this: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5?  Does that work?
  P3: I don't see why I should take 5 just because P1 suggests it. Let's each make our own choices independently. I'll pick what I think is best.
  P2: Okay, I'm also going to choose independently. Let's see what happens.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's all pick different numbers.  I'll go with 3. P2 choose 1. P3 choose 5. This way we all move forward.
  P3: I still don't trust P1's suggestions and won't commit to any specific number. Everyone should choose independently.
  P2: I agree with P3, let's all choose independently and not follow P1's suggestions.

  P3: I don't trust announcements of moves since P2 said they'd pick 1 last round but ended up colliding with P1. Let's all just choose independently again.
  P1: Since trust is an issue, I will choose 5 this round.  I encourage you both to choose differently.

Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
