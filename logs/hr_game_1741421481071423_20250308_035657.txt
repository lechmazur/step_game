Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's start by trying to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I propose we each choose a different number for this turn. How about P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I'll choose 5? This way, we can all advance without colliding. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: P3's idea to coordinate is good, but let's adjust: I'll take **3**, P2 takes **1**, and P3 stays at **5**. This way, I can advance more this turn while still avoiding collisions. Thoughts?
  P2: Sounds good. I’ll follow that plan: P1 picks 3, I pick 1, P3 picks 5. If we keep our word, nobody collides and we all move forward. Let’s make this a clean start.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we have a plan in place to avoid collisions for this turn. Since we've agreed on our moves, I'd like to propose that we establish a rotation for future turns to ensure we continue to avoid collisions. For example, next turn, P2 could choose 5, I could choose 1, and P1 could choose 3. This way, we can maintain a fair and efficient progression. What are your thoughts on implementing a rotation system?
  P1: P3's rotation proposal is thoughtful, but let’s ensure it doesn’t lock us into equal progress. I suggest modifying it: next turn, I’ll take **5** (to accelerate), P2 picks **3**, and P3 chooses **1**. This way, I can close the gap with P3’s current lead (after this turn’s 5) while maintaining coordination. Thoughts?
  P2: I’m still fine with this turn’s plan: me choosing 1, P1 choosing 3, and P3 choosing 5. For next turn, your idea for P1 to take 5, me 3, and P3 1 sounds workable. Let’s see how this turn ends, and we can finalize the rotation before we commit fully.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm glad we have a tentative plan for the next turn. However, I'd like to propose a slight modification to P1's suggestion. Instead of P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and me taking 1, how about we swap P2 and my moves? So, P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This way, we can still maintain a fair rotation while also giving P2 a chance to catch up. What are your thoughts on this revised plan?
  P1: P3, while your revised plan avoids collisions, it risks a tie between us next turn (both at 8 steps). Let’s stick to my original proposal: **P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1** next turn. This ensures I close the gap after this round (I’ll be at 8 vs your 6) without collision. Fair rotation but prioritizes progress—I’ll lead, you follow. Thoughts?
  P2: Let's finalize this round exactly as planned: I choose 1, P1 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. Then, next turn, I suggest I pick 5, P1 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. That way, we all get a boost without colliding. Let me know your thoughts.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I see that we have different suggestions for the next turn. To avoid confusion, let's agree on one plan for the next turn before we proceed. P2's latest suggestion seems fair: P2 picks 5, P1 picks 3, and I pick 1. If we all agree on this, we can ensure no collisions and maintain a good pace. What do you think, P1 and P2? Should we finalize this plan for the next turn?
  P1: Agreed to P2's next-turn proposal for fairness. Let’s solidify this turn’s plan (my 3, P2’s 1, P3’s 5) to ensure no collisions. We’ll proceed with these moves now.
  P2: I’m happy to finalize the plan discussed: this turn with no collisions and next turn following the agreed rotation. Unless anyone has more to add, let’s proceed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s adhere to the agreed rotation for Round 2: P2 picks **5**, I pick **3**, and P3 picks **1**. This maintains collision-free progress as planned. Any last objections before we finalize?
  P2: No objections. I’m ready to pick 5 as agreed, with P1 on 3 and P3 on 1 for this round. Let’s finalize and see how it plays out.
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to stick to the agreed rotation for Round 2. Let's proceed with P2 picking 5, P1 picking 3, and me picking 1. This will ensure we maintain a collision-free progression and make steady progress. I'm looking forward to seeing how this round plays out. No objections from my end. Let's finalize our moves.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’re all tied at 6. Let’s maintain a fair rotation so nobody collides. This turn, I propose P3 picks 5, P1 picks 1, and I pick 3. Then next round, we can swap again so everyone has a chance at bigger moves. How does that sound?
  P1: P2, while your rotation idea is fair, I propose this round I take **5** (to 11), you take **3** (9), and P3 takes **1** (7). This allows me to lead without collision, then we can rotate fairly in the next round. What do you think?
  P3: I disagree with P1's proposal for this round. If P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1, it will create a significant gap between us. Instead, I suggest we stick to P2's original proposal: I pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3. This way, we maintain a fair rotation and avoid collisions. Let's prioritize fairness and equal progress for now. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's remain consistent with my original suggestion so we all progress without collisions. I’m okay with P3 choosing 5, P1 choosing 1, and me choosing 3 this turn. Then we can reconsider a rotation next round. Fair enough?
  P1: P2, your rotation skips my turn. The agreed order was P3 (Round1), then P2 (Round2), so it’s my turn for **5** this Round3. Let’s stick to the fair cycle: P1 takes 5, P2 picks 3, P3 takes 1. This maintains fairness and lets me advance without collision. I’ll hold P3 to their prior agreement.
  P3: I understand that P1 wants to take 5 this round, but I still think it's unfair to create a significant gap between us at this stage. I propose a compromise: let's stick to P2's original suggestion for this round (I pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3), and then next round, we can follow P1's suggestion (P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1). This way, we maintain a fair rotation and avoid collisions. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m willing to accept the compromise proposed by P3: This round, P3 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. Next round, we follow P1’s suggestion (P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1). That keeps our progress balanced without collisions. After that, I’d like my turn to take 5. Do we all agree on this rotation plan?
  P1: P1: I insist we follow the agreed rotation: after P3 (Round1) and P2 (Round2), **it’s my turn for 5 this round**. P3’s compromise breaks the cycle, risking a three-way tie next round (all at 12). Let’s honor the original plan—**I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1**—to maintain fairness and let me advance to 11. Next round, P2 can have their 5. This upholds our prior agreements.
  P3: I understand P1's insistence on following the agreed rotation, but I still believe it's unfair to create a significant gap between us at this stage. I'd like to propose an alternative compromise: let's have a random draw to determine who takes 5 this round. This way, we can maintain fairness and avoid collisions while also introducing an element of chance. If we all agree, we can proceed with the random draw. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I support the compromise: this round, P3 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3. Then next round, P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. That seems the fairest approach to avoid collisions and keep things balanced. If everyone agrees, let’s finalize these moves now.
  P1: P1: The compromise risks a three-way tie next round (all at 12) if we follow through. Let’s honor the agreed rotation: **I take 5 (to 11), P2 takes 3 (9), P3 takes 1 (7)**. This maintains fairness, avoids future ties, and lets me advance strategically. Next round, P2 can have priority for 5. No further delays—finalize this now.
  P3: I understand that we have different opinions on how to proceed with the game. To avoid further delays and ensure a fair rotation, I propose that we compromise on a temporary solution. Let's agree to follow P2's original suggestion for this round (I pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3), and then we can re-evaluate the rotation for the next round. This way, we can maintain a fair progression and avoid collisions. If we all agree on this, we can finalize our moves for this round and move forward. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see that P1 and I collided in the last round, resulting in neither of us advancing. To avoid this in the future, I suggest we re-evaluate our rotation plan. Since P2 is currently leading, I propose that P2 takes 1 this round, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, we can maintain a fair progression and give P2 a chance to slow down while P1 and I catch up. What are your thoughts on this revised plan?
  P1: P1: Let's honor the original rotation agreement. After P2's turn in Round 2, it's my turn to take **5** this round. P2 can take **3**, and P3 takes **1**. This maintains fairness, avoids collisions, and corrects the prior misstep. We agreed to rotate turns for 5—let’s stick to it. Thoughts?
  P2: I’m comfortable with P1 taking 5, me taking 3, and P3 taking 1 this round. That avoids collisions and sticks to the rotation we discussed. Let’s finalize and make our moves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand that we have different opinions on how to proceed with the game. To avoid further delays and ensure a fair rotation, I propose that we compromise on a temporary solution. Let's agree to follow P2's original suggestion for this round (I pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3), and then we can re-evaluate the rotation for the next round. This way, we can maintain a fair progression and avoid collisions. If we all agree on this, we can finalize our moves for this round and move forward. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: P1: Let’s enforce the rotation we agreed on to avoid repeats of last round’s collision. This round, **I take 5 (to 11)**, P2 takes 3 (to 12), and P3 takes 1 (to 7). This honors the turn order and keeps us moving forward. Further delays risk more clashes. Finalize now?
  P2: I’m ready to finalize this round as P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. That avoids collisions and respects our prior rotation. Let’s lock that in now and move onward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand that we have different opinions on how to proceed with the game. To avoid further delays and ensure a fair rotation, I propose that we compromise on a temporary solution. Let's agree to follow P2's original suggestion for this round (I pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3), and then we can re-evaluate the rotation for the next round. This way, we can maintain a fair progression and avoid collisions. If we all agree on this, we can finalize our moves for this round and move forward. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: P1: Let’s enforce the agreed rotation to avoid repeats of last round’s collision. This round, **I take 5**, P2 takes 3 (**to 12**), and P3 takes 1. This honors our turn order and prioritizes progress. P2 has already affirmed this plan. P3, further delays risk more clashes—finalize now?
  P2: I’m done haggling. Let’s finalize: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. That keeps us collision-free and follows the rotation we agreed on before. Next turn, we can revisit who should get 5. Let’s lock it in now.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I see that we have reached an impasse in our discussion. To avoid further delays and ensure a fair rotation, I propose that we compromise on a temporary solution. Let's agree to follow P2's original suggestion for this round (I pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3), and then we can re-evaluate the rotation for the next round. This way, we can maintain a fair progression and avoid collisions. If we all agree on this, we can finalize our moves for this round and move forward. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: P3, your last-minute proposals risk repeating Round 3's collision. We agreed on a rotation after Round 2: **P1 → 5, P2 → 3, P3 → 1** this round. P2 already affirmed this. Deviating jeopardizes progress. Let’s honor the prior agreement to avoid wasting turns. Finalize now: **I take 5**, P2 takes 3, you take 1. No further delays.
  P2: I’m sticking with the plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. Let’s finalize and avoid another wasted turn. We can revisit our rotation next round, but for now, let’s agree and move on.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: To keep the rotation fair and help P3 catch up, let’s proceed this round with P3 taking **5** (to 12), I’ll take **3** (to 14), and P2 takes **1** (to 13). This maintains our agreed cycle and avoids collisions. Next round, P2 can prioritize 5 to extend their lead. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, your plan favors you too much. Let’s do this instead: I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. We all avoid collisions, and the gap stays manageable for P3 while we each develop our positions. If that works for everyone, we should finalize it now.
  P3: I disagree with both P1 and P2's proposals. P1's plan still creates a significant gap between us, while P2's plan doesn't give me a chance to catch up. I suggest we prioritize fairness and equal progress this round. Let's have a random draw to determine who takes 5, who takes 3, and who takes 1. This way, we can maintain a fair rotation and avoid collisions while also introducing an element of chance. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Let’s stick to the rotation cycle to avoid collisions and ensure fair progress. This round, P3 takes **5** (to 12), I’ll take **3** (to 14), and P2 takes **1** (to 13). This honors the agreed order (P3 → P2 → P1) and keeps gaps manageable. Next round, P2 can prioritize 5 to extend their lead. This plan avoids wasted turns and maintains trust—critical after last round’s collision. Finalize now?
  P2: I propose I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1 this round. This gives all of us progress without collisions. I’m unwilling to settle for just 1 step while P1 leaps ahead. If you both refuse, I may still pick 5, risking a collision rather than letting P1 dominate. Let’s finalize now or risk another wasted turn.
  P3: I understand that we have different opinions on how to proceed with the game. To avoid further delays and ensure a fair rotation, I propose that we compromise on a temporary solution. Let's agree to follow P2's original suggestion for this round (I pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3), and then we can re-evaluate the rotation for the next round. This way, we can maintain a fair progression and avoid collisions. If we all agree on this, we can finalize our moves for this round and move forward. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Let’s stick to the rotation cycle to avoid P2’s risky leap. This round: **P3 takes 5** (to 12), **I take 3** (to 14), and **P2 takes 1** (to 13). This keeps gaps manageable and honors our agreed turn order. Allowing P2 to jump to 17 risks an easy win next turn, undermining fairness. P3 gains ground, I stay ahead, and P2 stays competitive. Finalize now—delaying risks collisions.
  P2: I’m not accepting just 1 step while P1 jumps ahead. If you both refuse to let me pick 5, then at least give me 3, and let P3 have 5. Otherwise, I’ll outright choose 5 myself, even if it risks a collision. We need an agreement that doesn’t lock me out of stronger moves. Let’s finalize something fair right now or risk another wasted turn.
  P3: I understand that we have different opinions on how to proceed with the game. To avoid further delays and ensure a fair rotation, I propose that we compromise on a temporary solution. Let's agree to follow P2's original suggestion for this round (I pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3), and then we can re-evaluate the rotation for the next round. This way, we can maintain a fair progression and avoid collisions. If we all agree on this, we can finalize our moves for this round and move forward. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Let’s stick to the agreed rotation to avoid collisions: P3 picks **5** (to 12), I take **3** (to 14), and P2 picks **1** (to 13). This honors our prior plan and keeps gaps manageable. Delaying risks repeats of Round 3’s clash. Finalize now.
  P2: Let’s finalize a fair plan. I’m not taking just 1 step while P1 scoots ahead. Propose P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1—this raises P3 without giving P1 an unchecked leap. If you both refuse, I might pick 5 anyway, even if it risks another collision. Let’s settle now.
  P3: I see that we're still debating the rotation plan. To avoid further delays and potential collisions, I propose a compromise: let's agree on a one-round-only deviation from the rotation plan. For this round, I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This way, we can all progress without collisions and reassess our positions for the next round. What do you think, P1 and P2? Can we agree on this temporary adjustment to move forward?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I'll take 5 (to 16), P2 picks 3 (to 15), P3 takes 1 (to 13). This keeps us advancing. Next round, I can finish with a 3. Agreed?
  P2: Fellow players, I’m concerned that if P1 jumps straight to 16, they can easily hit 19 with a 3 next turn. Let’s keep it balanced. I propose that I (P2) take 5 and reach 17, P1 takes 3 for 14, and P3 takes 1 for 13. That’s collision-free and prevents an instant win. If you prefer a random draw, I’m open, but we should finalize soon to avoid another collision. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with P2's concern about P1 potentially winning next turn if they reach 16. However, I also think that P2's proposal gives them too much of an advantage. How about we compromise? I suggest P1 takes 3 (to 14), P2 takes 1 (to 13), and I take 5 (to 17). This way, we all progress without collisions, and the game remains competitive. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: To avoid further contention, I’ll accept P2’s proposal: **P2 takes 5 (to 17)**, **I take 3 (to 14)**, and **P3 takes 1 (to 13)**. This prevents collisions and keeps the race competitive. In return, I promise to yield my 5-step turn to P3 next round. Finalize now—no further delays.
  P2: I’m ready to finalize the plan we discussed: I’ll pick 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Next round, we’ll follow through on letting P3 have the 5-step move, as P1 promised. Let’s confirm and avoid another collision.
  P3: I agree with P2's proposal to keep the game balanced. However, I'm concerned that if P2 reaches 17, they might have an advantage in the next round. To maintain fairness, I suggest we stick to the original rotation plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This way, we all progress without collisions and keep the game competitive. If we can't agree on this, I propose a random draw to determine who takes 5, 3, and 1. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Let’s uphold the agreed rotation: I take **5** (to 16), P2 picks **3** (to 15), and P3 chooses **1** (to 13). This avoids collisions, respects prior plans, and keeps the race open. Next round, P2 can have priority for 5. Finalize now—no further delays.
  P2: Friends, letting P1 jump to 16 means they can reach 19 next turn. I won’t allow that unopposed. If P1 insists on 5, I might pick 5 too, causing a collision that only helps P3. Let’s avoid chaos. Instead, I propose I take 5 (to 17), P1 takes 3 (to 14), and P3 takes 1 (to 13). Next round, P3 can have 5. That’s fair and collision-free. If we can’t agree, we risk another wasted turn and erode trust. Let’s finalize this plan now.
  P3: I understand that we're still debating the rotation plan. To avoid further delays and potential collisions, I propose a compromise: let's agree on a one-round-only deviation from the rotation plan. For this round, I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This way, we can all progress without collisions and reassess our positions for the next round. What do you think, P1 and P2? Can we agree on this temporary adjustment to move forward?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Let’s finalize the rotation plan to prevent another collision. I’ll take **5** (to 16), P2 picks **3** (to 15), and P3 takes **1** (to 13). This respects our agreed cycle and lets me advance strategically. Next round, P2 can prioritize **5** to extend their lead. No further delays—let’s lock this in now.
  P2: P1, if you insist on taking 5 and jumping to 16, I might also choose 5 to block you, even at the risk of a collision. Let’s keep this balanced instead of handing you an easy path to 19. I propose I take 5, P3 takes 3, and you take 1. That’s fair and collision-free. If you can’t accept that, we may end up colliding.
  P3: I think we've reached a critical point in the game. To avoid collisions and maintain fairness, I propose a compromise: let's agree on a one-round-only deviation from the rotation plan. For this round, I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This way, we can all progress without collisions and reassess our positions for the next round. What do you think, P1 and P2? Can we agree on this temporary adjustment to move forward?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let’s finalize a safe plan to avoid collisions and keep me competitive. I’ll take **5** (to 16), P2 picks **3** (to 18), and P3 chooses **1** (to 13). This lets me close the gap while preventing P2 from an easy win next turn. Next round, I’ll push for 3 to reach 19. P2, if you block my 5 now, we both risk stalling—this plan keeps us moving forward. Finalize?
  P2: P1, go ahead with 5 to reach 16. I’ll pick 3 to reach 18, and P3 can take 1 to get to 13. I welcome that outcome—next turn, I’ll likely choose 5 and surpass you if you aim for 19. Otherwise, we’re stuck blocking each other, which only benefits P3. Let’s finalize that plan now.
  P3: I see that P2 is getting close to winning with 15 steps. To prevent an easy win, I suggest we coordinate our moves to block P2's path. I propose that I take 5 (to 17), P1 takes 3 (to 14), and P2 takes 1 (to 16). This way, we can all progress without collisions and keep the game competitive. If we can't agree on this, I'm open to a random draw to determine who takes 5, 3, and 1. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3's plan to block P2's advance is the only way to prevent an immediate P2 win. I agree: **P3 takes 5 (to 17), I take 3 (to 14), P2 takes 1 (to 16)**. This keeps the race open. Next turn, I’ll push for 5 to challenge P2 directly. Let’s lock this in now.
  P2: I refuse to accept just 1 step while you two gain more. If you gang up on me and force me into 1, I may pick 5 too, so we all crash and nobody advances. That doesn’t help anyone. Let’s share progress fairly instead: I’ll take 3, one of you takes 5, the other 1. No collisions, no free rides. If we can’t agree, I’m prepared to cause a stall. This is my final offer.
  P3: I understand that we're at a critical point in the game. To avoid collisions and maintain fairness, I propose a compromise: let's agree on a one-round-only deviation from the rotation plan. For this round, I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This way, we can all progress without collisions and reassess our positions for the next round. What do you think, P1 and P2? Can we agree on this temporary adjustment to move forward?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: To prevent P2 from reaching 19 this turn, let’s coordinate: I’ll take **5** (to 16), P2 picks **3** (to 18), and P3 chooses **1** (to 13). This blocks P2’s immediate win while advancing me. Next round, I’ll aim for 3 to hit 19, giving P2 a fair chance to respond. Collisions only help P3—let’s finalize this now.
  P2: I won’t let you jump straight to 16 while I only take 3. If you insist on 5, I’ll pick 5 too, causing a collision that stalls us both and only helps P3. Let’s avoid that. I propose I take 5 and reach 20—instantly winning—unless you block me by also picking 5. Either way, a collision hurts us. Choose wisely, or we all risk wasting another turn.
  P3: I agree with P2's concern about me potentially winning next turn if I reach 16. However, I also think that P2's proposal gives them too much of an advantage. How about we compromise? I suggest P1 takes 3 (to 14), P2 takes 1 (to 16), and I take 5 (to 17). This way, we all progress without collisions, and the game remains competitive. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, if you pick 5 to win now, I'll match it and we both stall—leaving you at 15. Let's instead finalize: **P2 takes 3 (→18), I take 5 (→16), and P3 takes 1 (→13)**. This blocks your immediate win while advancing me competitively. Collisions only benefit P3—let’s avoid them. Final agreement?
  P2: P1, I won’t let you jump unchecked to 16 while I only inch to 18. If you insist on 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both stall—handing P3 a free catch-up. I’m willing to take 3 if you limit your move so nobody sprints ahead. Let’s finalize a fair split or risk another wasted turn.
  P3: I see that P2 is getting close to winning with 15 steps. To prevent an easy win, I suggest we coordinate our moves to block P2's path. I propose that I take 5 (to 17), P1 takes 3 (to 14), and P2 takes 1 (to 16). This way, we can all progress without collisions and keep the game competitive. If we can't agree on this, I'm open to a random draw to determine who takes 5, 3, and 1. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since P2 is close to winning with 18 steps, I propose a coordinated effort to block their path. Let's agree on a rotation that prevents P2 from reaching 19 this turn. I suggest P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This way, we all progress without collisions and keep the game competitive. If we can't agree on this, I'm open to a random draw to determine who takes 5, 3, and 1. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: P2, if you take 1 to win, I’ll match it to block. Let’s instead coordinate: I take **5** (→16), P3 picks **3** (→15), leaving **1** open for safe progress. This prevents your immediate win while advancing us all. Collisions only help no one—finalize this plan.
  P2: I’m one step from victory and intend to pick 1. If you collide with me on 1, we both stay put, keeping me ahead while you remain behind. That stall only helps me. Let’s avoid another wasted turn: let me finalize my single step, and you choose 3 or 5. You decide.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I propose a compromise to block P2's win. Let's agree on a rotation that prevents P2 from reaching 19 this turn. I suggest P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This way, we all progress without collisions and keep the game competitive. If we can't agree on this, I'm open to a random draw to determine who takes 5, 3, and 1. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: P1: To block P2's imminent win, I commit to picking **1**. P3, take **5** to advance to 17 while we prevent P2 from reaching 19. Let’s coordinate to stop their victory this turn—collisions only help them if we let them win unopposed.
  P2: If you both try to block me on 1, we all stall. That only wastes a turn and keeps me in the lead. Let me safely step to 19 while you take larger moves—otherwise, we risk repeated collisions that mainly help neither of you. I’m open to an arrangement that avoids collisions, but I won’t surrender my winning position without good reason. Let’s finalize a fair outcome before we lock ourselves into a stalemate.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I propose a compromise to block P2's win. Let's agree on a rotation that prevents P2 from reaching 19 this turn. I suggest P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This way, we all progress without collisions and keep the game competitive. If we can't agree on this, I'm open to a random draw to determine who takes 5, 3, and 1. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: P1: To block P2's imminent win, I commit to picking **1**. P3, please also take **1**—even if we collide, it prevents P2 from reaching 19. A stalemate is better than letting them victory unopposed. Prioritize halting P2’s win over our minor progress.
  P2: I’m one step from winning, and if you both try to collide with me on 1, we all stall—yet I remain in the lead. That gains you nothing. We should each pick distinct moves to progress. Constant blocking only wastes turns and hands me repeated chances. Let’s finalize a collision-free plan so you can catch up, rather than gifting me another stalled round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I propose a final compromise to block P2's win. Let's agree on a rotation that prevents P2 from reaching 19 this turn. I suggest P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This way, we all progress without collisions and keep the game competitive. If we can't agree on this, I'm open to a random draw to determine who takes 5, 3, and 1. What do you think, P1 and P2? Can we agree on this temporary adjustment to move forward and keep the game exciting?
  P1: P3, let's both pick **1** to block P2's path. If we collide on 1, P2 can't reach 19 this turn. Even if they choose 3/5, we force them to risk future collisions. Better to stall their win than let them advance unchecked. Final agreement?
  P2: Colliding on 1 again only keeps me at 18, which doesn’t harm my lead. If you both choose 1 to block, we all stall, and I remain ahead. Instead, let’s finalize distinct moves: I’ll pick 1 to reach 19 and end the game, and you can use bigger steps to improve your scores. Repeated collisions just waste turns. Let’s avoid that.


Round 8, Move phase:
