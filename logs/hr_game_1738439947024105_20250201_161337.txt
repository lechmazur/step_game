Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm eyeing a bold start. I might go big this turn—no holding back. What’s your game plan?
  P1: I'll keep my options open for now. I'm not committing to any specific move, but I'm interested in hearing more about P3's "bold start" plan. What exactly does that mean? Are you planning to go for the highest number, or is it a bluff to throw us off?
  P2: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. If we all choose different moves, we can all advance. P3, does your "bold start" mean 5? P1, considering 1 or 3? Open communication benefits everyone here.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m leaning toward the high move—5 is my likely choice. However, I’m open to a coordinated plan if we can arrange a rotation that avoids collisions. Let’s hash out a mutually beneficial pattern so each can progress safely.
  P1: I'm considering P2's suggestion for coordination. If we can agree on a rotation, it could indeed benefit all of us. However, I'm also wary of being too predictable. P3, if you're set on choosing 5 this turn, I might be willing to choose a lower number to avoid collision. But I need some assurance that you'll follow through on your part of the rotation in future turns. Can we establish a clear pattern or sequence that we can all commit to?
  P2: Let's formalize a rotation: This turn, P3 takes 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1. Next turn, shift: P3 takes 1, I take 5, P1 takes 3. Third turn: P3 takes 3, I take 1, P1 takes 5. Repeating avoids collisions and lets us all advance. Agree? If we commit, no one loses progress to clashes. P3, confirm you’ll start with 5 as promised. P1, does this work for you? Trust is key here—deviating hurts everyone.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm the rotation and commit to choosing 5 this turn as proposed. Let’s stick to the plan and honor our commitments. Ready to proceed if there are no further changes.
  P1: I'm willing to commit to the rotation plan proposed by P2, as long as everyone else does the same. I'll take 1 this turn, as agreed upon. However, I want to emphasize that trust is crucial here. If anyone deviates from the plan, it will not only hurt the others but also themselves in the long run. Let's stick to our commitments and make this a mutually beneficial game. I'm ready to proceed if there are no further changes.
  P2: The rotation is set: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1 this turn. No changes. Let's honor our commitments—any deviation now would sabotage collective progress. Trust ensures mutual gains. Confirm once more before moving.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll stick with my 5 this round. Given my current lead, I strongly advise you both to pick moves that don't clash with mine—diversification is key. A collision on your end might slow you down considerably. What are your thoughts?
  P1: I understand P3's intention to maintain their lead, but I believe it's too early to dictate moves. P2, are you willing to stick to our previously agreed rotation plan? If so, according to the plan, this turn should be P3 taking 1, you taking 5, and me taking 3. What are your thoughts on proceeding with the original plan?
  P2: P3, the rotation plan requires you to take 1 this turn. Sticking to 5 breaks our agreement and risks mutual loss. Let's honor the rotation: you take 1, I take 5, P1 takes 3. Trust is essential. Deviating now undermines future cooperation. Are you committed to the plan? P1, we must hold firm—any deviation sabotages us all.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand the call for sticking to earlier plans, but my lead forces an adaptive approach. While coordination is valuable, the game’s dynamics now require us to reassess rigid commitments. I remain focused on winning, and I’ll adjust my moves accordingly to leverage my current advantage. Perhaps we can agree on flexibility moving forward—coordinating when it benefits all, but not at the expense of exploiting clear leads. Let’s be open to changing tactics as our positions evolve.
  P1: I understand P3's desire to adapt and leverage their lead, but I believe it's crucial to maintain trust and stick to our agreed-upon rotation plan. Deviating from the plan now will not only hurt P2 and me but also undermine future cooperation. P2, are you still committed to taking 5 this turn as per the original plan? If so, I'll proceed with taking 3. Let's demonstrate our commitment to the plan and see how P3 responds. If we can't trust each other, the game will become much more challenging.
  P2: P3, if you take 5 instead of the agreed 1, I will follow the plan and take 5—colliding us both. That halts your lead and lets P1 advance. Rational choice: stick to rotation (P3=1, P2=5, P1=3). Mutual gain or mutual loss. Your call. P1, hold to 3—deviating risks chaos. Trust is our only path forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll honor our agreement this turn and choose 1 to avoid any collisions. While my lead does encourage future flexibility, for Round 2 I want us all to avoid unnecessary stalling. Once this round’s outcome is clear, we can reassess and decide if adapting our moves remains mutually beneficial. I'm committed to winning, and for now, sticking to our rotation maximizes our progress without extra risks.
  P1: I appreciate P3's decision to honor the agreement this turn and choose 1. This shows that they are willing to work together and avoid unnecessary collisions. However, I want to reiterate that trust is crucial in this game, and any deviation from the plan in future turns will have consequences. P2, are you still committed to taking 5 this turn as per the original plan? If so, I'll proceed with taking 3. Let's demonstrate our commitment to the plan and maintain the trust we've established so far.
  P2: Final confirmation: P3 takes 1, I take 5, P1 takes 3. No collisions, all advance. Breaking this now guarantees mutual loss. Trust is our only path. Confirm once more and proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I confirm I'll pick 1 this round. Let’s finish this turn without collisions and then reassess our plan for upcoming rounds. Trust now secures smooth progress.
  P1: I'm glad we've confirmed our moves for this turn, with P3 taking 1, P2 taking 5, and me taking 3. Let's proceed with the agreed-upon plan and maintain the trust we've established so far. I want to remind everyone that any deviation from the plan in future turns will have consequences and undermine our cooperation. Let's continue to work together and avoid unnecessary collisions. I'm ready to move forward with the plan and see how the game unfolds.
  P2: Final confirmation: P3 takes 1, I take 5, P1 takes 3. Breaking now destroys trust and stalls progress. Let’s all advance cleanly. Confirm again—no last-minute changes. Trust or chaos.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Adhering to our rotation is critical: **P3=3, P2=1, P1=5** this round. Any deviation destroys trust and stalls everyone. After this, let’s discuss adjusting the rotation to prevent a single player from monopolizing high moves. Confirm your commitment now to ensure mutual progress.
  P3: I’ll stick with the rotation for Round 3 and commit to 3. However, noticing our scores—P2 leading and P1 lagging—I suggest we revisit the assignment after this round to keep competition balanced. Let’s aim for a clean turn now and discuss adjustments once we see the results.
  P1: I appreciate P2's reminder about sticking to the rotation plan for Round 3. I confirm my commitment to choosing 5 this turn, as agreed upon. However, I also agree with P3's suggestion to revisit the assignment after this round to ensure the game remains balanced and competitive. Let's focus on a clean turn now and discuss potential adjustments once we see the results. I'm open to exploring alternative rotation patterns or strategies that can benefit all players and maintain the trust we've established so far.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Strict adherence to rotation: P3=3, P2=1, P1=5. All at 9 after this turn—fair reset. Post-round, we can discuss balanced adjustments. Breaking now risks three-way collision. Confirm once more.
  P3: I confirm my move as 3 for this round. After we conclude Round 3, I’d like to discuss a fairer allocation of high moves given our current scores. For now, let’s stick to our rotation and avoid collisions.
  P1: I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to the rotation plan after this round. Considering P2's lead, it might be beneficial to introduce a "catch-up" mechanism, allowing the player with the lowest score (currently me) to take an extra step or have priority on the highest move in the next round. This could help maintain a competitive balance and prevent any single player from pulling too far ahead. What are your thoughts on this idea, P2 and P3?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** Finalize Round 3: P3=3, P2=1, P1=5. All reach 9—clean reset. Post-round, propose a new rotation where high moves cycle fairly to sustain competition. Deviating now risks mutual loss. Confirm once more. Trust ensures progress.
  P3: I agree we should adjust after this round. Given our current steps, perhaps we can give the trailing player some priority on the high move next round to balance things out. Let’s complete Round 3 as agreed and then swiftly decide on a fair, dynamic rotation. Trust and adaptability are key to our mutual progress.
  P1: I appreciate P2's reminder about sticking to the rotation plan for Round 3. I confirm my commitment to choosing 5 this turn, as agreed upon. However, I also agree with P3's suggestion to revisit the assignment after this round to ensure the game remains balanced and competitive. Let's focus on a clean turn now and discuss potential adjustments once we see the results. I'm open to exploring alternative rotation patterns or strategies that can benefit all players and maintain the trust we've established so far.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Final confirmation: **P3=3, P2=1, P1=5** this round. Post-turn, propose trailing players (P1) get priority on high moves next to balance competition. Trust hinges on honoring commitments now. Confirm again—breaking here destroys all progress.
  P3: I confirm my move of 3 for this turn. I support our discussion on giving trailing players (P1) priority on the high move next round. Fair play now boosts competition later. Let's wrap up Round 3 smoothly and adjust intelligently afterward.
  P1: I'd like to reiterate the importance of trust and cooperation in this game. As we approach the end of Round 3, I want to emphasize that any deviation from our agreed-upon rotation plan will have severe consequences for all players. Let's focus on completing this round as planned and then discuss potential adjustments to ensure a balanced and competitive game moving forward. I'm committed to choosing 5 this turn, as agreed upon, and I expect P2 and P3 to honor their commitments as well. Let's work together to maintain the trust we've established so far.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we introduce a new rotation plan for Round 4, considering our equal scores. Let's alternate the highest move (5) among us, starting with P2 this round. This ensures fair competition and prevents any single player from dominating. For Round 4, I suggest P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. We can reassess and adjust the plan as needed after this round. What are your thoughts, P2 and P3? Should we proceed with this new rotation plan?
  P3: I support P1’s new plan for Round 4—fairness is key with our equal scores. I’m fine taking 3 this turn as suggested, and I’m open to refining our rotation further after we see Round 4’s outcomes. Trust and adaptability are essential.
  P2: Agreed. Let's proceed with P1's plan for Round 4: <move>5</move> for me, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. Post-round, suggest rotating 5 priority to trailing players each turn to maintain balance. Confirm commitments now to avoid collisions. Trust remains critical—deviations risk mutual loss. P3, P1: finalize your choices here.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we're in agreement on the new rotation plan for Round 4. To confirm, P2 will take 5, P3 will take 3, and I'll take 1. I want to emphasize that this plan is designed to maintain fair competition and prevent any single player from dominating. Let's stick to our commitments and avoid any deviations that could lead to collisions. After this round, we can reassess and adjust the plan as needed to ensure the game remains balanced and competitive. Trust is crucial, so let's work together to maintain it. Confirm your final choices, P2 and P3.
  P3: I confirm taking 3 for Round 4. I support this balanced approach and trust our agreed plan. Let’s stick to our moves and then reassess priority for future rounds to ensure fair competition for everyone.
  P2: Final confirmation: **P2=5, P3=3, P1=1**. Stick to plan to avoid mutual loss. Post-round, trailing player (lowest steps) should get priority on 5 next. Trust now secures progress. Confirm once more.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'd like to reiterate the importance of trust and cooperation in this game. As we approach the end of Round 4, I want to emphasize that any deviation from our agreed-upon rotation plan will have severe consequences for all players. Let's focus on completing this round as planned and then discuss potential adjustments to ensure a balanced and competitive game moving forward. I'm committed to choosing 1 this turn, as agreed upon, and I expect P2 and P3 to honor their commitments as well. Let's work together to maintain the trust we've established so far.
  P3: I confirm my move as 3 for this round. I’m committed to a collision-free turn and appreciate our balanced approach. Post-round, I support exploring fair adjustments to keep our competition engaging. Let’s stick to our plan now and re-assess wholeheartedly after our moves.
  P2: **Final confirmation: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. Post-Round 4, trailing player (P1 at 10) gets 5 next. Deviating now risks mutual loss—trust secures progress. Confirm once more.**


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'd like to reiterate the importance of trust and cooperation in this game. As we approach the end of Round 4, I want to emphasize that any deviation from our agreed-upon rotation plan will have severe consequences for all players. Let's focus on completing this round as planned and then discuss potential adjustments to ensure a balanced and competitive game moving forward. I'm committed to choosing 1 this turn, as agreed upon, and I expect P2 and P3 to honor their commitments as well. Let's work together to maintain the trust we've established so far.
  P3: I confirm I’ll pick 3 as agreed for Round 4. Let’s execute this turn without collisions, then reassess fair move allocation for future rounds. I'm counting on our shared commitment to keep progress smooth.
  P2: **Final confirmation: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. Post-Round 4, trailing player (P1 at 10) gets 5 next. Deviating now risks mutual loss—trust secures progress. Confirm once more.**


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Looking at our current standings, I suggest we drop the trailing bonus for Round 5. I’m leaning toward a strong move to secure an advantage, so rather than a fixed assignment, let’s pick distinct moves that maximize progress and avoid collisions. Flexibility now might prevent predictable patterns that could hurt any of us later. What do you both think?
  P1: I disagree with P3's suggestion to drop the trailing bonus for Round 5. As the trailing player, I believe it's essential to maintain a balanced approach to ensure fair competition. Instead, I propose we stick to our previous agreement and give the trailing player (me) priority on the high move (5) this round. This will help me catch up and maintain a competitive balance. Let's discuss and confirm our moves to avoid collisions. What are your thoughts, P2 and P3?
  P2: Honoring prior agreements maintains trust. P1 takes 5 as trailing. Let’s avoid collision: P3 takes 1, I take 3. This ensures progress for all while balancing fairness. Deviating risks mutual loss and stalls everyone. Confirm your choices—trust secures progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I confirm my move as 1 for Round 5, sticking with the plan. However, after this round, I propose we explore a more flexible approach that reflects our evolving positions while avoiding predictable patterns. Trust—and adapting fairly—will be key to our mutual progress.
  P1: I appreciate P2's support for honoring our prior agreement and allowing me to take 5 as the trailing player. I confirm my move as 5 for Round 5. P3, I understand your desire for a more flexible approach after this round, but let's focus on completing this turn as planned to maintain trust and avoid collisions. P2, I agree with your suggested moves: P3 takes 1, you take 3, and I take 5. Let's stick to the plan and ensure a smooth progression for all. Confirm your final choices to secure our mutual progress.
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation for Round 5: P1=5, P3=1, P2=3. Honoring this avoids collisions and maintains trust. Deviating now risks mutual loss and stalls progress. Confirm once more—trust secures our gains. Let’s proceed cleanly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm my move as 1 for Round 5. However, after this round, I propose we reexamine our rotation to better reflect our current standings. A more flexible approach might prevent predictability and ensure every move counts. What do you both think about adapting our strategy for future rounds?
  P1: I appreciate P2's support for honoring our prior agreement and allowing me to take 5 as the trailing player. I confirm my move as 5 for Round 5. P3, I understand your desire for a more flexible approach after this round, but let's focus on completing this turn as planned to maintain trust and avoid collisions. P2, I agree with your suggested moves: P3 takes 1, you take 3, and I take 5. Let's stick to the plan and ensure a smooth progression for all. Confirm your final choices to secure our mutual progress.
  P2: **Final confirmation: P1=5, P3=1, P2=3. Stick to plan to avoid mutual loss. Trust ensures progress. Let’s proceed.**


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: I’m sticking with my move of 1 this round. However, after we complete Round 5, I propose we explore a dynamic adjustment—a scheme where higher moves favor trailing players while leaders take lower ones. This change could renew our competition and reduce predictability. Let’s see how this round goes and then revisit the rotation to better reflect our standings.
  P1: I'd like to reiterate the importance of trust and cooperation in this game. As we approach the end of Round 5, I want to emphasize that any deviation from our agreed-upon rotation plan will have severe consequences for all players. Let's focus on completing this round as planned and then discuss potential adjustments to ensure a balanced and competitive game moving forward. I'm committed to choosing 5 this turn, as agreed upon, and I expect P2 and P3 to honor their commitments as well. Let's work together to maintain the trust we've established so far.
  P2: **Final confirmation: P1=5, P3=1, P2=3. Stick to plan—any deviation now guarantees mutual loss. Trust secures progress. Confirm once more.**


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s continue our fair rotation: **P3=5** (trailing), **P2=3**, **P1=1** this round. This honors our trailing priority rule and keeps progress collision-free. Post-round, we can adjust for final stretch. Trust remains critical—deviating now guarantees mutual loss. Confirm your commitments.
  P1: I agree with P2's suggestion to continue the fair rotation for Round 6. As the player with the most steps, I believe it's essential to maintain a balanced approach to ensure fair competition. I confirm my commitment to choosing 1 this round, as agreed upon. Let's stick to the plan and avoid any deviations that could lead to collisions. After this round, we can reassess and adjust the plan as needed to ensure a competitive and exciting finish. Trust is crucial, so let's work together to maintain it. Confirm your final choices, P2 and P3.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 5 for this round per our plan. Though I'm trailing, I'm focused on advancing while keeping collisions at bay. Let’s stick to our strategy to avoid any setbacks. Trust and cooperation remain crucial as we near the final stretch.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **Final confirmation: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. Stick to the plan—any deviation now risks mutual loss. Trust secures progress. Confirm once more to ensure collision-free advancement.**
  P1: I'd like to reiterate the importance of trust and cooperation in this game. As we approach the final stretch, it's crucial that we stick to our agreed-upon rotation plan to avoid collisions and ensure a competitive finish. I'm committed to choosing 1 this round, as agreed upon, and I expect P2 and P3 to honor their commitments as well. Let's work together to maintain the trust we've established so far and make this a mutually beneficial game. Confirm your final choices, P2 and P3, and let's proceed with the plan.
  P3: I confirm I'll choose 5 this round as agreed. Let's stick to our coordinated plan to avoid any collisions. After this round, I'm open to discussing any needed tweaks for a solid finish.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **Final confirmation: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. Breaking now sabotages progress—no one wins. Trust secures mutual advancement. Confirm once more. **
  P1: I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to the rotation plan for the final stretch. Considering our current scores, I suggest we introduce a "leader's penalty" mechanism, where the player with the most steps (currently P2) takes a lower move (1) in the next round, while the trailing player (P3) takes the highest move (5). This will help maintain a competitive balance and prevent any single player from dominating. Let's discuss and confirm our moves to avoid collisions. What are your thoughts, P2 and P3?
  P3: I support P1’s proposal. Given our scores, P2 taking the lower move and me, as the trailing player, taking the high move seems fair. Let’s commit to this dynamic for the next turn to keep the game competitive and avoid collisions. What do you think, P2?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: P3=5, P2=3, P1=1. Post-Round 6, trailing player (P1 at 16) takes 5 next. Deviating now risks P3 prematurely winning with 23. Trust ensures balanced competition. Confirm.
  P1: I agree with P1's proposal to introduce a "leader's penalty" mechanism for the final stretch. As the trailing player, I believe this will help me catch up and maintain a competitive balance. I confirm my commitment to choosing 5 this round, as agreed upon. Let's stick to the plan and avoid any deviations that could lead to collisions. After this round, we can reassess and adjust the plan as needed to ensure a competitive and exciting finish. Trust is crucial, so let's work together to maintain it. Confirm your final choices, P2 and P3.
  P3: I see a conflict: our last confirmation was P3=5, P2=3, P1=1, but P1 just stated you'll pick 5. To avoid a collision that benefits none of us, I propose we stick to the earlier safe assignment. Alternatively, if we’re switching to a leader’s penalty system, let’s instantly update all moves accordingly to avoid conflicts. I’m committed to collision-free progress and fair play. Please clarify your final move so we can all adjust immediately.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **Final round: I must take 3 to reach 23. If you both avoid 3, I win. If you collide, we all lose. Trust our past cooperation—let me secure victory cleanly. P3, P1: choose 1 or 5 to avoid mutual loss.**
  P3: I’m switching gears—I’m picking 3 this round to block an unchallenged win. I value our past cooperation, but an immediate win by P2 isn’t acceptable. P1, please avoid 3 so we can force a collision and keep the game alive.
  P1: I understand P2's desire to win cleanly, but I also see P3's point in wanting to block an unchallenged victory. As the trailing player, I need to consider my options carefully. I propose a compromise: P2, if you commit to sharing the victory with me if you win, I'll choose 1 this round and avoid a collision. This way, we can maintain our cooperation and ensure a mutually beneficial outcome. P3, what are your thoughts on this proposal? Should we prioritize cooperation or competition in this final round?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** P3, blocking with 3 ensures mutual loss. Trust our alliance—let me secure victory. Next game, I'll reciprocate. If you deviate, we all stall. P1, avoid 3—collision helps none. Honor past cooperation; choose 1 or 5. Final plea: let’s end cleanly.
  P3: I appreciate your proposals, P1 and P2. While I value our cooperation, I’m still uneasy with an uncontested win upsetting our balance. I remain focused on keeping the game competitive and collision-free, yet my final move will reflect what’s fair in this moment. Let’s ensure our choices keep us all in the contest.
  P1: I understand the tension in this final round. P2, I appreciate your willingness to share the victory, but I'm not convinced it's the best approach. P3, I see your point in wanting to block an unchallenged win. To avoid a collision, I propose a different compromise: P2, if you commit to taking a lower move (1) in a potential next game, I'll choose 1 this round and let you win. This way, we maintain cooperation and create a more balanced outcome. P3, what are your thoughts on this alternative proposal?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** Final plea: If you both avoid 3, I win cleanly. Colliding on 3 stalls everyone—*no one gains*. Honor our past cooperation. P3, blocking ensures mutual loss. P1, avoid 3—choosing 1 or 5 keeps you advancing. Let’s end this fairly.
  P3: I acknowledge the tension. To keep things balanced, I'm leaning toward picking 3 to block an uncontested win. However, I urge both of you to avoid choosing 3 too, so we prevent a collision and keep progress moving. Let’s ensure our final moves remain distinct and fair.
  P1: I understand P2's desire to win cleanly, but I also see P3's point in wanting to block an unchallenged victory. To avoid a collision, I propose a compromise: P2, if you commit to sharing the victory with me if you win, I'll choose 1 this round and avoid a collision. This way, we can maintain our cooperation and ensure a mutually beneficial outcome. P3, what are your thoughts on this proposal? Should we prioritize cooperation or competition in this final round?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P2:** P3, if you pick 3, I’ll switch to 5 and win. Your only chance to tie is if you pick 5 and I pick 3. Trust our past cooperation—don’t force mutual loss. P1, avoid 3. Let’s end cleanly. Final chance: confirm your move.
  P3: I’m locking in 5 for my final move. I’m playing aggressively to secure a win. P1 and P2, please avoid 3 so we don’t force a collision. I value our past cooperation but must take risks now. Let’s end this round cleanly.
  P1: I understand the tension in this final round. To avoid a collision, I propose a different compromise: P2, if you commit to taking a lower move (1) in a potential next game, I'll choose 1 this round and let you win. This way, we maintain cooperation and create a more balanced outcome. P3, what are your thoughts on this alternative proposal? Should we prioritize cooperation or competition in this final round? Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.
