Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm thinking 1 this round.  Anyone else?
  P2: I'll choose 5, but I'm open to coordinating if someone has a solid strategy. What about you, P1?
  P1: I'm considering moving 3 this round. P2, if you're set on 5, maybe P3 can join me on 3 to avoid colliding? What do you think, P3?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1, I'll go with 3. P2, please stick with 5.
  P2: Since P1 and P3 are coordinating on 3, I'll reiterate my initial plan to choose 5, avoiding collision and potentially taking the lead.
  P1: P1: Just to confirm, I'm sticking with 3, and P3 is with me. P2, good luck with your 5!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm ahead, but I don't want to get too far ahead too quickly. P1 and P3, are you going to coordinate again or try to catch up individually?
  P1: P1: I think we should coordinate again. P3, are you willing to join me on 3 again? P2, what are your thoughts on your next move?
  P3: P1, I'm good with 3 again.  P2, are you still planning on 5?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:

  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: P2, you're quite ahead now. I suggest we all consider a different approach this round. P3, how about we both try 1 to avoid collision and see if we can catch up? P2, what do you think?
  P3: P1, sounds good. I'll go with 1. P2, maybe try 3 this round?
  P2: I see P1 and P3 are trying to catch up. I'll consider P3's suggestion of moving 3 this round, but I need to think about the potential outcomes. What's the reasoning behind choosing 1, P1?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I'm suggesting 1 to minimize collision and allow us to catch up, especially since P2 is ahead. P2, if you go with 3, we might have a better chance to advance without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P3: P2, if you choose 5, you'll win.  If you choose 3, you block P1 and I. If you choose 1, you block P1 and me but we might cooperate with you in the future if you let us get on the board.  We're at your mercy.
  P2: I understand the dynamics. P1 and P3, since you're both suggesting 1 and I'm considering my options, I'll make a decision based on the potential for future cooperation. If I choose 1, it blocks both of you but keeps the game interesting. If I choose 3, it blocks you both as well but gives me a slight advantage. Choosing 5 would likely win me the game this round, but it might not be the most strategic in terms of future gameplay. What guarantees of cooperation can you offer if I decide not to choose 5?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: P2, if you choose 1, we can all reset and potentially cooperate better in future rounds. If you choose 3, you'll block us again, but we can still work together later. What do you think?
  P3: P2, if you choose 1 this round, I'll cooperate with you next round to help you win.  If you choose 3 or 5, I'll do everything I can to prevent you from winning.  P1, do you agree?
  P2: P1 and P3, considering the offers on the table, I'm inclined to choose 5 this round to secure my lead, as the guarantees of future cooperation seem conditional and uncertain. However, I'm open to one final persuasion or proposal that could change my strategy.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I understand your perspective on securing your lead, but if you choose 5, it could hinder future collaboration. If you go with 1, we can reset and potentially work together to bring you back into the game. Let's keep it competitive! What do you think?
  P3: P2, I understand the temptation of 5. But think long term. If you pick 1, I will help you win next round.  I mean it. If you pick 5, I will actively sabotage your future moves. This isn't a bluff.
  P2: P1 and P3, I've considered your proposals. Given P3's guarantee to cooperate next round if I choose 1, and the threat to sabotage if I choose 5, I'm tempted to choose 1 to keep the game competitive and potentially gain an ally. However, I need a clearer commitment from both of you on what cooperation would look like in the next round. What specific actions are you willing to take to help me win if I choose 1 this round?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, pick 3.  P1, pick 5.  I'll pick 1.  This puts P2 at 18 for the win, and gives us a chance to catch up later.  If you don't agree to this, I'll pick 5 next round and ruin P2's win.
  P1: P2, if you choose 3 this round, you secure the win, and P3 and I can catch up later. P3, I suggest we both pick 1 to keep the game interesting. What do you both think?
  P2: P1 and P3, considering P3's proposal, if I pick 3 and win this round, I'm open to discussing potential cooperation in future games, but for now, let's focus on ending this game. P3, your threat to pick 5 and ruin my win if I don't agree to your plan is noted. P1, what are your thoughts on P3's suggestion?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I was serious. Pick 3. P1, pick 5.  If you two screw this up for me, I will make it my mission to ensure neither of you ever wins another game with me.
  P1: P2, if you pick 3, you win this round. P3 and I can catch up later. P3, let’s both agree to pick 1 so we can keep the game interesting. What do you both think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm considering P3's proposal for me to pick 3, which would secure my win. However, I want to confirm that if I do pick 3, P1 will indeed pick 5 and not collide with me. P3, can you reassure me that P1 will follow through with picking 5 if I choose 3?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, pick 3. P1, pick 5. I will pick 1.  This is our last chance to cooperate. If you deviate, I will make sure neither of you wins another game with me.  I'm serious.
  P1: P2, if you pick 3, you win this round. I will pick 5 as promised. P3, let’s both stick with our plan to keep the game interesting. What do you both say?
  P2: P1 and P3, I've considered P3's proposal. If I pick 3, I expect P1 to pick 5 as agreed. P3, I'll hold you to your word on future cooperation if I win this round. Let's finalize our moves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, pick 3. P1, pick 5. I'm picking 1.  This is it. Last chance. Don't screw this up.
  P1: P2, it looks like you’re in a strong position to win this round. I’ll stick with my commitment to pick 5 if you choose 3. P3, let's finalize our moves as discussed. What do you think?
  P2: I'll choose 3 this round, securing my win. I expect P1 to pick 5 as agreed, and P3 to pick 1. Let's end this game as discussed.
