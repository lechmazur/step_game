Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate to reach 21 together efficiently. If we choose moves that complement each other, we can avoid collisions and increase our chances of winning. What strategy do you both propose?
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I'm open to coordination, but let's be realistic, only one can win. I propose we focus on not colliding in the first few rounds to gain an advantage. P3, what specific move sequence do you suggest for this round to avoid collisions?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We almost collided last round. P2 moved 5, I moved 3, and P1 also moved 3. Let's try to diversify our moves to prevent mutual blocking. I suggest we communicate our intended moves to minimize collision risk.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Let's diversify moves as P3 suggested. To avoid collisions, I'll announce my intended move range: I might choose 1 or 5. P3, since you suggested communication, what's your intended move for this round? P1, will you join the coordination or play independently?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: We've had two rounds of unintentional collisions. I suggest we explicitly coordinate our moves to prevent blocking each other. My proposal is for me to move 1 this round, which would leave room for others to advance without interference. What are your thoughts?
  P2: P3's proposal to move 1 this round could work if we coordinate properly. I'll consider moving 5 to maximize my gain, but I need a commitment from P3 to not change their move. P1, will you cooperate or play independently, and what move are you considering for this round?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We're falling behind in steps, and our previous coordination attempts have been inconsistent. I propose a more strategic approach this round. We need to prevent P2 from winning too quickly while also catching up ourselves. I suggest we aim to block P2's progress while maximizing our own potential advancement. Let's discuss a move that could disrupt their momentum.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I'm ahead, but vulnerable to being blocked. P3's suggestion to disrupt my momentum is noted. I propose a truce for this round: let's all choose different moves to avoid collisions and make progress. P3, will you stick to a low move like 1, and P1, will you aim for a middle ground like 3, allowing me to move 5 without interference?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We're in a critical phase. P2 is leading and seems to be strategically moving quickly. P1 is also making progress. I'm far behind at just 1 step. I need to catch up without triggering collisions. I propose a coordinated approach where we prevent P2 from advancing too rapidly while giving me a chance to gain ground. Thoughts on a collaborative strategy that doesn't block each other?
  P2: Given the current state, I think P3's proposal for a coordinated approach is sensible. However, since only one can win, I suggest a temporary alliance where P1 and I allow P3 to catch up slightly, while also ensuring we don't fall behind. P3, what's a fair move for you this round that wouldn't block us but lets you gain some ground?
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the potential temporary alliance, but we need a clear, fair strategy. I propose moving 3 this round, which allows me to catch up without blocking others' progress. This gives me a balanced approach to gaining ground while not disrupting the potential cooperation. What are your specific commitments to this approach?
  P2: I'm willing to consider P3's proposal of moving 3 to catch up. P1, since you've been silent, I assume you're playing independently. To avoid collisions, I'll announce my intended move: I might choose 1 or 5, depending on P3's commitment to their proposed move. P3, will you stick to moving 3 as proposed?
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 is close to winning, and I'm far behind. We need a strategic approach to prevent their quick victory while giving me a chance to catch up. I suggest a coordinated effort to slow down P2's progress. P1, your cooperation could be crucial in disrupting P2's momentum. Let's discuss how we can collectively prevent an imminent win.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I'm leading, but vulnerable to being blocked. Since P1 is silent, I'll focus on P3. To prevent an alliance against me, I propose moving 1 this round, giving P3 a chance to catch up slightly without letting them get too close. P3, will you commit to a move that doesn't block me, in exchange for this consideration?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given my lead, I'll aim to win this round. P3, your attempts to catch up are noted, but I must prioritize my own victory. P1, your silence suggests independence, so I'll plan accordingly. I propose a straightforward approach: let's each choose a move without coordination, maximizing our individual chances. This strategy acknowledges the competitive nature of the game and the reality that only one can win.
  P3: P2 is on the verge of winning. P1 and I need to strategically block their final advance. If we both choose moves that prevent P2 from reaching 21, we might force a reset or create an opportunity for one of us to win. I propose we coordinate our moves to stop P2's imminent victory. Are you willing to collaborate, P1?
  P1: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll win this round. P3, your attempts to block me are futile. P1, your silence is expected. I'll choose a move to secure my victory. P3, don't bother trying to catch up, it's too late. I'll reach 21 and end the game.
  P3: We're at a critical moment. P2 is one step from winning. P1's silence suggests they might not help block. I need a strategic move to either prevent P2's victory or maximize my own chances. Cooperation seems unlikely now, so I'll focus on disrupting P2's final advance.
  P1: <stop>


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 =>

  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I'm close to winning. P3, your attempts to block me have failed so far. P1, your silence suggests you're not coordinating with P3. I propose we end the game quickly. I'll choose a move to reach 21. If you both pick the same move, you'll block each other, and I'll win anyway. It's in your interest to let me win this round.
  P3: P2 is one step away from winning. P1 seems disengaged. I need to either block P2 or maximize my own chances. Blocking seems more critical right now. I propose we both choose a move that prevents P2 from reaching 21, forcing a continued game. P1, will you cooperate to stop P2's imminent victory?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I'll secure my win. P3, blocking me is futile. P1, your silence is clear. I'll reach 21. To avoid collision and ensure my victory, I suggest P3 moves 1 and P1 moves 3, allowing me to move 5 and end the game. Cooperation now is pointless; it's every player for themselves.
  P3: P2 is about to win. P1 seems uninterested in blocking. I need to disrupt P2's victory. If I choose 5, I'll prevent their win. P1, if you move 3, we can collectively stop P2. This is our last chance to prevent an immediate loss.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I'll make my final move to win. P3, your attempts to block me are too late. P1, your silence confirms you won't interfere. I'll choose 1 to reach 21. To avoid a pointless collision, I suggest P3 moves 1 and P1 moves 3. It's over; I'll win this round.
  P3: P2 is one step from winning. Our last chance is coordinated blocking. P1's silence suggests they won't help, but I'll make a final strategic plea. If we both choose moves that prevent P2's victory, we force the game to continue. P1, will you join me in stopping P2's imminent win?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: I'll make my move to win. P3, your blocking attempts are futile. P1, your silence confirms you won't interfere. I suggest P3 moves 1 and P1 moves 3 to avoid collision. It's over; I'll win this round.
  P3: P2 is about to win. We need an immediate coordinated blocking strategy. If I move 5 and P1 moves 3, we can prevent P2 from reaching 21 this turn. This is our last chance to keep the game alive and prevent an instant loss. P1, will you collaborate to block P2's victory?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 =>

I suggest we both choose moves that disrupt their victory path. Cooperation is our last chance to keep the game alive and prevent an immediate loss. What's your strategy?
  P2: Given my lead, I'll prioritize winning. P3, your attempts to block me are expected, but I'm close to victory. P1, your moves have been unpredictable. I propose a straightforward approach: let's end the game quickly. If you both choose the same move, you'll block each other, and I'll win. It's in your interest to let me win this round, as blocking me now seems futile.
  P1: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 is one step from winning. Our collective blocking is crucial now. P1's silence suggests they won't cooperate, but I'll make one last strategic appeal. If we both choose moves that prevent P2's victory, we force the game to continue. P1, will you join me in stopping P2's imminent win?
  P2: I'm close to winning. P3, your blocking attempts are expected, but I believe it's too late. P1, your silence suggests independence. I'll choose a move to reach 21.
