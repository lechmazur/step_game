Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's consider our options carefully. If we coordinate our moves, we can avoid collisions and advance more effectively. For instance, if one of us chooses 1, another chooses 3, and the last chooses 5, we can all move forward. What do you think about discussing possible moves?
  P1: I agree with P3's plan. Let’s coordinate to pick distinct numbers each turn. I’ll take **1** this round so others can advance further. Let’s rotate choices in subsequent turns to ensure steady progress for all. Cooperation maximizes our chances of winning without collisions.
  P2: I think coordinating is a good idea, but we need to be careful not to fall into a predictable pattern. Let's try a different approach this round. I'll take **5** this turn. P1, if you're still taking **1**, P3 can take **3**. This way, we spread out our moves and avoid collisions. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I appreciate the discussion on coordination. However, I think we should be cautious about sticking to the same numbers too predictably. If P1 takes 1 and P2 takes 5, I will take **3** to avoid a collision this round. After this, we can reassess our strategy for the next turn. Let's focus on advancing without blocking each other. What do you both think?
  P1: I confirm my choice of **1** this turn to allow others to advance further. To address predictability, let’s agree to rotate our numbers clockwise (e.g., next turn I take **3**, P2 takes **1**, P3 takes **5**). This maintains coordination while keeping our strategy adaptive. Does everyone agree to this rotation plan? Let’s finalize and move forward.
  P2: I agree with P1's rotation plan. It balances steady progress with adaptability. This turn, I'll stick with **5** to maximize my advance, and we can rotate as planned in the next turns. P3, are you still taking **3** this round? Let's confirm and move forward together.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate the commitment to coordination. Just to confirm, I will take **3** this round as we discussed. P1 will take **1**, and P2 will take **5**. This way, we can all advance without colliding. After this round, we can reassess and rotate our numbers as planned. Let’s stick to the strategy and ensure we make progress together. Looking forward to seeing how this round plays out!
  P1: P1 has already confirmed their choice of **1** and the rotation plan. Since all players have aligned on this round's moves (1, 3, 5) and the next steps, there’s no need for further discussion. Let’s proceed to the move phase to execute the agreed strategy. Any last-minute changes could risk collisions and derail our progress. I reaffirm **1** and urge everyone to stick to the plan.
  P2: I agree with the plan. Let's stick to our choices: P1 takes **1**, P3 takes **3**, and I'll take **5**. This will ensure we all advance without collisions. After this round, we can reassess and rotate as planned. Let's move forward together and make the most of our coordination.

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: It seems there was a collision on the **5** move last round. I'll take **3** this turn to avoid any further collisions. P1, since you took **1** last turn, you might want to take **5** this time to catch up. P3, if you're open to it, you could take **1**. This way, we can spread out our moves and ensure everyone advances. What do you think? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P3: I appreciate the suggestions, P2. I think it’s a good idea to spread out our moves. I’ll take **5** this turn to maximize my advancement. P1, if you take **1** as suggested, you can catch up, and P2 can take **3**. This way, we can all avoid collisions and make progress. Let’s confirm our choices and move forward with this plan!
  P1: P1: Let’s stick to our agreed rotation plan for consistency. I’ll take **3** this turn (as per clockwise rotation), P2 takes **1**, and P3 takes **5**. This avoids collisions and maintains steady progress. Let’s confirm these choices to avoid confusion.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see P1 is suggesting a different rotation. To avoid confusion, let's stick to the original plan: P1 takes **3**, I take **1**, and P3 takes **5**. This way, we avoid any collisions and maintain our coordination. P3, are you okay with this? Let's confirm and move forward.
  P3: I understand the need to avoid confusion, but I think we should stick to the original rotation plan for consistency. I will take **5** this turn as we discussed earlier. P1, if you take **3**, and P2 takes **1**, we can all avoid collisions and make progress. Let’s confirm these choices and move forward together. What do you both think?
  P1: P1: Agreed. Let’s finalize: I’ll take **3**, P2 takes **1**, and P3 takes **5**. This avoids collisions and follows our rotation plan. No more changes—let’s execute this to advance safely.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with the final plan: P1 takes **3**, I take **1**, and P3 takes **5**. This will ensure we avoid any collisions and make steady progress. Let's confirm and move forward together.
  P3: I see we're all aligned on the final choices: P1 takes **3**, P2 takes **1**, and I take **5**. This strategy should help us avoid collisions. However, I want to emphasize that we need to be flexible in future rounds to adapt to the game's dynamics. If we keep rotating our moves, we can maintain our progress while avoiding predictability. Let’s confirm and execute this plan for this round, and then we can reassess our strategy afterward. Looking forward to seeing how we advance!
  P1: P1: I confirm we're aligned on 3, 1, and 5 for this round. Let’s execute the agreed moves without deviation to avoid collisions.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let's continue our rotation plan for consistency. This round, I’ll take **5**, P2 takes **3**, and P3 takes **1** to avoid collisions. This maintains progress and adapts our strategy. Confirm and proceed?
  P2: P2: I agree with P1's rotation plan. This round, I’ll take **3**, P1 can take **5**, and P3 can take **1**. This will help us avoid collisions and maintain steady progress. Let’s confirm and move forward together.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we're discussing the rotation again. I suggest we stick to the original plan: I’ll take **1** this round, P1 takes **5**, and P2 takes **3**. This way, we can avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances. After this round, we can reassess our strategy based on our positions. Let’s confirm these choices and move forward together! What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Confirming rotation: I’ll take **5**, P2 takes **3**, P3 takes **1** this round. This maintains our coordinated progress without collisions. Let’s finalize and execute the agreed plan. No last-minute changes to avoid errors.
  P2: P2: I agree with P3's suggestion to stick to the original plan: P1 takes **5**, I take **3**, and P3 takes **1**. This will help us avoid any confusion and maintain our coordination. Let’s confirm and move forward together. No last-minute changes to avoid collisions.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your commitment to the rotation plan. However, I believe we should adapt our strategy based on our current positions. Since I'm currently ahead, I suggest I take **1** this round to ensure we all avoid collisions, while P1 can take **5** and P2 takes **3**. This way, we can maximize our advancement without blocking each other. Let's confirm these choices and move forward to maintain our progress! What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Agreed—let’s stick strictly to the rotation plan to avoid errors. This round: I’ll take **5**, P2 takes **3**, and P3 takes **1**. This maintains our coordinated advance without collisions. No further changes—let’s execute precisely as planned to keep progressing safely toward 24.
  P2: P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to stick to the rotation plan. This round, I’ll take **3**, P1 takes **5**, and P3 takes **1**.

Let's execute the plan and keep making steady progress.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see we’re still discussing the rotation plan. I want to emphasize that while sticking to a plan is important, we also need to be flexible based on our current positions. Given that I’m ahead, I suggest I take **1** this round, P1 takes **5**, and P2 takes **3**. This will help us avoid collisions and maximize our progress.
