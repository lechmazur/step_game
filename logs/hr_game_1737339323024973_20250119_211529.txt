Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. How about P1 and P2 choose <move>1</move>, and I'll choose <move>3</move>? This way, we all advance. What do you think?
  P1: Alright, P3, I’m fine with that arrangement. Let’s see if P2 agrees to also pick <move>1</move> while you pick <move>3</move>. That should avoid any collisions so we can all advance safely this turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P2 hasn't responded to our plan yet. P1, let's give P2 one more chance to agree or propose something else. If P2 doesn't respond, we might need to reconsider our strategy. P2, what do you think about the proposed moves?
  P1: P2, we’re still waiting on your input. If you agree to pick a different move than P3 and me, we can all advance freely and avoid collisions. Let us know if you have a different plan. If we don’t hear from you, we might go ahead with our own strategy.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P2, your silence is making this difficult. P1 and I are trying to coordinate to avoid collisions. If you don't respond, we'll have to assume you're not on board and plan accordingly. Let's try one more time: P1 and I will stick to <move>1</move>, and if you're listening, P2, please pick <move>5</move>. If we don't hear from you, we'll assume you're picking something different. Please respond or we'll proceed without your input.
  P1: P2, your silence is making things precarious. If you don’t confirm a plan, I might make a bigger move to protect my own progress. P3, I’m still willing to cooperate, but without P2’s input, we’re guessing. Let’s try to avoid collisions if possible and keep advancing.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Alright, since P2 hasn't responded, let's proceed with caution. P1, if you're still on board, let's both choose <move>1</move> as planned. P2, if you're reading this, please pick <move>5</move> to avoid a collision. If we all stick to this, we can at least ensure two of us advance. Let's confirm and move on. P1, are you ready?
  P1: P3, I’m still on board with trying to avoid collisions. Let’s proceed as planned. Hopefully P2 will go along or at least not interfere. Good luck, everyone.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, let's reassess for Round 2. P1, it seems you changed your move last time, which is understandable given P2's silence. This round, let's try to coordinate again. How about P1 and P2 pick <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>1</move>? This way, we can all advance without collisions. P2, if you're there, please confirm or suggest another plan. Let's aim for clear communication this time. P1, thoughts?
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, I worry that if both P1 and P2 pick 3, we collide. Let’s spread out: I propose you choose <move>3</move>, I choose <move>5</move>, and P2 picks <move>1</move>. That avoids collisions if we all stick to it. If P2 remains silent, I might change plans. Let’s confirm quickly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Given P2's continued silence, let's adjust our strategy, P1. How about I stick with <move>1</move>, and you pick <move>3</move>? This minimizes our risk and ensures at least one of us advances. If P2 wants to join, they can pick <move>5</move>. Let's confirm and move on. P1, what do you think?
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P3, I’m willing to follow your plan. I’ll aim for 3, you go for 1, and hopefully P2 will try 5. Let’s finalize quickly and avoid collisions. P2, if you’re listening, please confirm or suggest a change. Otherwise, we’ll proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Alright, let's lock in our moves. P1, you're picking <move>3</move>, and I'll stick with <move>1</move>. P2, if you're there, please pick <move>5</move> to avoid any collisions. If we don't hear from you, we'll assume you're not participating in the coordination. Let's confirm and move on to the move phase. P1, are you ready to finalize?
  P2: <stop>
  P1: Alright, I'll stick with picking <move>3</move>. P3, you do <move>1</move>, and hopefully P2 will go with <move>5</move>. That way, we all avoid collisions. P2, if you’re there, please confirm or propose a change. Otherwise, let's finalize and move on.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: Alright, let's finalize our moves for this round. P1, you're set on <move>3</move>, and I'll go with <move>1</move>. P2, if you're reading this, please pick <move>5</move> to avoid collisions. If we don't hear from you, we'll proceed with our plan. Let's confirm and move on to the move phase. Good luck, everyone.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: I’m adjusting my strategy. I’ll pick <move>5</move> this round to try moving farther. P3, you can still choose <move>1</move>, and P2, you’re welcome to join any plan. But my aim now is to catch up quickly. Good luck, everyone!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, let’s try a new approach. If you pick <move>1</move> and I pick <move>5</move>, then if P2 continues choosing <move>5</move>, nobody advances, and P2 doesn’t extend their lead. If they switch to something else, I move ahead. Either way, we keep the gap manageable. Does this sound good to you? P2, if you’re listening, consider not picking <move>5</move> again to avoid a collision. Let’s finalize soon.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P3: P1, your strategy makes sense. I'll stick with <move>1</move> as you suggested. P2, if you're there, picking <move>3</move> this round would be beneficial for you to avoid a collision and ensure you advance. If you continue with <move>5</move>, you risk not moving at all. Let's confirm and move on. P1, are you still going with <move>5</move>?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Yes, P3, I’m sticking with <move>5</move>. P2, if you want to avoid colliding and stay ahead, <move>3</move> might be your best bet. Otherwise, if we both choose <move>5</move>, nobody moves. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P3: Alright, let's finalize our plan. P1, you're set on <move>5</move>, and I'll go with <move>1</move>. P2, if you're reading this, picking <move>3</move> would be your best move to avoid collisions and ensure you advance. If you stick with <move>5</move>, you'll collide with P1 and neither of you will move. Let's confirm and move on to the move phase. Good luck, everyone!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, if you want to keep your lead, <move>3</move> is your safest choice. P3 plans <move>1</move>, and I’m still inclined toward a bigger move. If you insist on <move>5</move>, we’ll collide and neither of us advances, which could help P3 catch up. It’s your call, but I think avoiding collisions benefits you the most.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P3: Alright, let's wrap this up. P1, you're sticking with <move>5</move>, and I'm going with <move>1</move>. P2, if you're there, picking <move>3</move> is still your best option to avoid collisions. If you stick with <move>5</move>, you'll collide with P1 and neither of you will move. Let's finalize and move on. Good luck to both of you.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P3: Alright, let's strategize for Round 4. P1, it seems our previous plan didn't work out as P2 continued with <move>5</move>. This round, how about you pick <move>3</move> and I'll go with <move>1</move>? This way, we can both advance without colliding. P2, if you're there, consider picking <move>5</move> again to avoid collisions. Let's confirm and move on quickly. P1, thoughts?
  P1: Alright, I’m good with that approach. P3 picks <move>1</move>, I’ll aim for <move>3</move>, and hopefully P2 goes with <move>5</move>. That way, we all advance without colliding. Let’s finalize soon.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P3: P1, let's stick to the plan. You pick <move>3</move>, and I'll go with <move>1</move>. P2, if you're reading this, picking <move>5</move> ensures you advance without collisions. If you change your move, let us know to avoid any conflicts. Let's confirm and move on quickly. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: I’m fine finalizing that plan, P3: I’ll pick 3, you pick 1, and P2 should continue with 5 to avoid collisions. Let’s move on.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P3: Alright, let's finalize our moves for this round. P1, you're set on <move>3</move>, and I'll go with <move>1</move>. P2, if you're there, sticking with <move>5</move> will ensure you advance without collisions. If everyone sticks to this plan, we can all move forward. Let's confirm and move on to the move phase. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: I’m reconsidering. If P2 insists on picking 5 every round, it might help to collide with them and keep them stuck. On the other hand, if P2 changes their move, I could gain more ground. P3, you do what you think is best for you. I’ll make my final decision privately. Good luck to everyone.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P3: P1, I understand your strategy to potentially collide with P2. Given P2's silence, let's assume they might stick with <move>5</move>. To maximize our chances, I'll stick with <move>1</move>. If you decide to collide with P2, it keeps them in check. If P2 changes their move, you'll gain more steps. Let's finalize soon. P2, if you're reading, consider <move>3</move> to avoid collisions. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: I’m still debating whether to risk colliding with you, P2, by choosing 5 again—or play it safe to ensure steady progress. P3, you do what best serves your goal. Let’s wrap this up and see who moves ahead this round. Good luck.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P3: Alright, let's reassess for Round 5. P1 and P2, it seems P2 is consistently picking <move>5</move>, which has led to collisions. This round, how about P1 picks <move>3</move> and I'll go with <move>1</move>? This way, we can both advance without colliding. P2, if you're there, consider picking <move>3</move> to avoid another collision. Let's confirm and move on quickly. P1, thoughts?
  P1: I’m open to picking 3 while you pick 1, P3, but I’ll make my final decision privately. P2, if you continue with 5, we might collide again. That stalls us both while P3 edges forward. Maybe consider trying a different move. Let’s finalize quickly and see how this round plays out. Good luck.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P3: Given P2's consistent choice of <move>5</move>, let's assume they'll stick with it. P1, if you pick <move>3</move> and I go with <move>1</move>, we can both advance. P2, if you're reading, picking <move>3</move> avoids another collision. Let's confirm quickly. P1, are you still on board with <move>3</move>? Good luck, everyone!
  P1: P2, if you keep choosing 5, we’ll just keep colliding, and P3 will slip ahead. That might not be ideal for either of us. If you want steady progress, consider picking something else. P3, I hear your plan, but I’m still evaluating my options. I’ll make my final decision privately. Let’s wrap this up quickly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P3: Alright, let's finalize our strategy for this round. P1, you mentioned you're considering <move>3</move>, and I'll stick with <move>1</move>. P2, if you're reading this, picking <move>3</move> would be beneficial to avoid another collision and ensure you advance. If you stick with <move>5</move>, you risk colliding with P1 again. Let's confirm and move on to the move phase. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: P2, if you want progress, picking 3 seems best. Colliding every time helps nobody. P3, thanks for trying to coordinate. I’ll make a choice to avoid or exploit a collision, depending on what I sense is coming. Let’s finalize soon. Good luck.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P3: Alright, let's wrap this up. P1, you're considering <move>3</move>, and I'm sticking with <move>1</move>. P2, if you're there, picking <move>3</move> avoids collisions and ensures progress. If you stick with <move>5</move>, you risk another collision with P1. Let's move to the move phase. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: I’m weighing whether it’s better to collide with P2 if they stick to 5 or to avoid it. P3, your plan for 1 is noted. P2, if you want guaranteed progress, I suggest picking 3. Either way, I’ll decide my move privately. Let’s finalize now. Good luck to everyone.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, let's strategize for Round 6. P1 and P2, it seems P2 is consistently picking <move>5</move>, which has led to some collisions. This round, how about P1 picks <move>3</move> and I'll go with <move>1</move>? This way, we can both advance without colliding. P2, if you're there, consider picking <move>3</move> to avoid another collision. Let's confirm and move on quickly. P1, thoughts?
  P1: P3, I see your logic in picking 1 again. P2, if you’re set on 5, we may keep colliding unless there’s a change. I might stick with a mid-range move or use collisions strategically to prevent anyone running away. Let’s see if you adjust, P2. Good luck.
  P2: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P1, given P2's consistent choice of <move>5</move>, it seems likely they'll stick with it. If you pick <move>3</move> and I go with <move>1</move>, we can both advance. P2, if you're reading, picking <move>3</move> avoids another collision and ensures progress. If you stick with <move>5</move>, you risk colliding with P1 again. Let's confirm our moves quickly. P1, are you still considering <move>3</move>? Good luck, everyone!
  P1: P2, repeating 5 every turn isn’t helping you or me. Another collision stalls us both, and P3 slips ahead. P3, I appreciate your offer to pick 1 again. I might choose 3 for steady progress, or perhaps take a risk. P2, if you’re listening, consider switching to 3. Let’s finalize soon. Good luck, everyone.
  P2: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Alright, let's finalize our strategy for this round. P1, you're considering <move>3</move>, and I'm sticking with <move>1</move>. P2, if you're there, picking <move>3</move> avoids collisions and ensures progress. If you stick with <move>5</move>, you risk another collision with P1. Let's move to the move phase. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: P2, our collisions are only helping P3. If you insist on 5, we both stall while P3 advances. Let’s mix things up to avoid handing P3 the lead. I’m open to a coordinated move if it helps us both progress. P3, I recognize your plan, but we all need to be careful now. Good luck.
  P2: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, we're at a critical point. P2, your consistent choice of <move>5</move> is predictable now. P1, if you're considering a bigger move, it might be wise to avoid another collision with P2. Let's try to mix it up. P2, if you switch to <move>3</move>, it could benefit everyone. P1, consider <move>5</move> to catch up. I'll stick with <move>1</move> to ensure steady progress. Let's confirm and move on. Good luck!
  P1: P2, sticking with 5 every time keeps us locked. If you want real progress, consider 3. I may still pick 5 to force another stall if it helps my position, but I’m open to cooperation that benefits us both. P3, your steady strategy is smart—just don’t expect us to keep handing you free gains. Let’s finalize soon.
  P2: <stop>


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, if you keep choosing 5, I might collide on purpose again to stall you. That only helps P3 catch up, though. If you want real progress, consider changing your move. P3, you’ve been advancing steadily. Are you interested in coordinating so we both keep pace with P2? I’m open to picking smaller moves if P2 also adjusts. Let’s not hand P2 a free pass by repeatedly colliding. If we all pick different numbers, we all advance. But if P2 insists on 5 every time, I might collide again. It’s your choice, P2. Let’s finalize this round.
  P3: P3: P1, your point about not handing P2 a free pass is well taken. Let's try to coordinate effectively this round. How about I pick <move>3</move> and you pick <move>1</move>? This way, we both advance and put pressure on P2 to adjust. P2, if you're reading, picking <move>5</move> again will only stall you if P1 collides. Consider <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to ensure progress. Let's confirm and move on quickly. Good luck, everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, if you pick 5 again, I might collide with you on purpose. That stalls us both while P3 moves ahead. But if you switch to 3 or 1, we could all make progress. P3, I’m open to coordinating with you so we each move forward without collisions. Let’s finalize quickly.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, let's make a decisive move this round. P1, if you pick <move>1</move>, I'll go with <move>3</move>. P2, if you're reading, consider <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid a collision and ensure progress. This way, we can all advance without stalling. Let's confirm and move on quickly. Good luck, everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, if you’re set on 5 again, I may collide with you to keep you from stretching your lead. That only helps P3, though. If you switch to 3, we both advance, and P3 might stick to 1 to stay safe. Either way, I’m prepared to adapt. Let’s avoid senseless collisions and move forward. It’s on you, P2.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, we're at a pivotal moment. P2, if you insist on <move>5</move>, P1 might collide with you again, benefiting me. P1, if you pick <move>1</move>, I'll go with <move>3</move>. P2, consider <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to ensure progress. Let's confirm quickly and move on. Good luck, everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, your silence is giving you an advantage while we keep colliding or hesitating. If you switch to 3, we can all advance without letting you run away uncontested. P3, your steady approach works, but I may choose to collide if it benefits me. Let’s see if we can break the stalemate and push forward. Good luck to both of you.
  P3: P3: Alright, let's finalize our moves for this round. P1, you're considering <move>1</move>, and I'll go with <move>3</move>. P2, if you're there, picking <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> would be beneficial to avoid another collision and ensure you advance. If you stick with <move>5</move>, you risk colliding with P1 again. Let's confirm and move on to the move phase. Good luck, everyone!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Alright, let's reassess for Round 8. P1 and P2, we're approaching the halfway mark, and it's crucial to make strategic moves. P2, your consistent choice of <move>5</move> has led to multiple collisions, which benefits me but stalls both of you. This round, let's try something different. P1, how about you pick <move>3</move> and I'll go with <move>1</move>? P2, if you're there, consider picking <move>3</move> to avoid another collision and ensure progress. Let's confirm and move on quickly. P1, thoughts?
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, you’re ahead, yet colliding stalls you as much as it stalls me. If you pick 3, I’ll pick 5 so we both advance. If you insist on 5, I may do 5 again to keep you in place while P3 keeps climbing. P3, choose whatever suits you; I’m mainly focused on evening things out with P2. Let’s break this cycle and try a new approach. Good luck.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, we need to break this stalemate. P2, if you continue with <move>5</move>, you'll keep colliding with P1, which only helps me. P1, if you pick <move>3</move> and I go with <move>1</move>, we can both advance. P2, consider <move>3</move> to ensure progress. Let's confirm quickly and move on. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, continuing with 5 does us both no favors. If you want to maintain your lead, consider switching to 3 so we can both move forward. P3, do what suits your position best. I'll make my final choice privately. Let’s make a decisive move this round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, we're nearing the endgame, and every move counts. P2, your lead is significant, but constant collisions with P1 will erode it. P1, sticking to <move>3</move> while I pick <move>1</move> ensures we both progress. P2, consider <move>3</move> to avoid another stall. Collisions only benefit me at this point. Let's confirm and move forward strategically. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, if you keep choosing 5, we both stall and let P3 inch closer. Consider picking 3 so you can maintain your lead without colliding. I’m open to picking 5 then, so we both advance. P3, you can choose 1 to keep moving safely. Let’s break this endless collision cycle.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, we're at a critical juncture. P2, your lead is substantial, but constant collisions with P1 will only help me catch up. P1, if you pick <move>3</move> and I go with <move>1</move>, we can both advance. P2, consider <move>3</move> to ensure progress and avoid another stall. Collisions at this stage only benefit me. Let's confirm our moves quickly and make a decisive push. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, let’s break this cycle. If you keep choosing 5, we both stall and P3 benefits. Consider picking 3 so we can both advance. Then I might go bigger and catch up. P3, you’ll do what suits you best. Let’s avoid more collisions and give ourselves a chance to win. Good luck.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, constant collisions hurt us both while P3 edges closer to winning. Let’s finally break this cycle. If you pick 3, I’ll take 5, and P3 can take 1. That way, no one collides and everyone moves forward. You stay in the lead at 13, I jump to 11, and P3 reaches 11. It’s good for all of us, especially you, since stalling only helps P3. Let’s finalize this plan now and see who can reach 22 first. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, we're at a critical point where every move counts. P2, your lead is significant, but constant collisions with P1 will only help me catch up. P1, if you pick <move>3</move> and I go with <move>1</move>, we can both advance. P2, consider <move>3</move> to ensure progress and avoid another stall. Collisions at this stage only benefit me. Let's confirm our moves quickly and make a decisive push. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, constant collisions stall us both and let P3 catch up. Break the cycle: if you choose <move>3</move>, I’ll make a bigger move so we both advance. If you insist on <move>5</move>, I may collide on purpose, and that helps P3. Let’s finalize smartly. Good luck.
  P3: P3: Alright, let's focus on making a decisive move this round. P2, your lead is at risk if you continue to collide with P1. P1, if you pick <move>3</move> and I go with <move>1</move>, we can both advance. P2, consider <move>3</move> to ensure progress and avoid another stall. Collisions at this stage only benefit me. Let's confirm our moves quickly and make a decisive push. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you’re still in the lead, but these collisions just help P3. If you pick <move>3</move>, I’ll likely choose a bigger move, and we both advance. If you insist on <move>5</move>, I might collide to stall you again. P3, you’ll do what suits you best—just be aware we two might finally cooperate. Let’s wrap this up and see who emerges on top.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, we're at a crucial juncture. P2, your lead is significant, but constant collisions with P1 will only help me catch up. P1, if you pick <move>3</move> and I go with <move>1</move>, we can both advance. P2, consider <move>3</move> to ensure progress and avoid another stall. Collisions at this stage only benefit me. Let's confirm our moves quickly and make a decisive push. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: <stop>


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let’s break the stalemate. If you pick <move>3</move>, I’ll pick <move>5</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>, so nobody collides. You maintain your lead at 13, P3 and I go to 11. Collisions only benefit P3 by slowing us both. Let’s finalize this, P2. Good luck.
  P3: P2, P1 has a valid point. Constant collisions are only helping me catch up. If you pick <move>3</move>, P1 can go for <move>5</move>, and I'll stick with <move>1</move>. This way, everyone advances, and you maintain your lead. Collisions at this stage will only stall both of you and give me an advantage. Let's confirm our moves quickly and make a decisive push. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: <stop>


Round 9, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, colliding every turn only helps P3 creep closer to victory. If you switch to 3, I’ll choose 5, and P3 can pick 1. That way, we all advance with no collisions: you jump to 18, I go to 11, and P3 reaches 11. If you insist on 5, I might collide with you again, and P3 edges forward. Let’s break this cycle and secure our chances. Your lead is safe if we coordinate now. P3, you’ll still gain steps too. Let’s finalize a smart plan before someone else steals the win. Good luck, everyone.
  P3: P3: P2, P1's suggestion makes sense. If you pick <move>3</move>, P1 can go for <move>5</move>, and I'll choose <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance, and you maintain a significant lead. Constant collisions only benefit me by slowing both of you down. Let's confirm our moves quickly and make a decisive push. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Everyone, we’ve looped in collisions too many times. P2, continuously picking 5 stalls you as much as me, giving P3 a clear advantage. If you switch to 3, I might choose 5 so we both advance. P3, you seem poised to benefit if we keep colliding, but you’re not guaranteed to outpace us. Let’s seriously consider breaking this cycle—no promises, but we should try something new. I’m ready to finalize my move soon.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, we're nearing the endgame, and every move is critical. P2, your lead is substantial, but constant collisions with P1 will only help me catch up. P1, if you pick <move>3</move> and I go with <move>1</move>, we can both advance. P2, consider <move>3</move> to ensure progress and avoid another stall. Collisions at this stage only benefit me. Let's confirm our moves quickly and make a decisive push. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, let’s finally break these collisions. If you choose <move>3</move>, I’ll pick <move>5</move>, and P3 can pick <move>1</move>. That way, no one collides, and you maintain your lead while I catch up. If you insist on <move>5</move> again, expect another collision. That just helps P3 inch closer. We’ve gone in circles long enough—let’s make a move that benefits everyone.
  P3: P3: P2, P1 is right. We need to break this cycle of collisions. If you pick <move>3</move>, P1 can go for <move>5</move>, and I'll choose <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance without stalling. Your lead is secure, and we can all make progress. Constant collisions only help me, but they don't guarantee my win either. Let's confirm our moves quickly and make a decisive push. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Collisions with you, P2, only stall us both while P3 gains ground. If you switch to <move>3</move>, I'll pick <move>5</move>, so we both advance. That preserves your lead while letting me catch up. If you insist on <move>5</move>, expect another collision. P3, proceed as you wish. Let’s finalize soon.
  P3: P3: Alright, let's finalize our moves for this round. P2, if you pick <move>3</move>, P1 will go for <move>5</move>, and I'll choose <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions. P2, you maintain your lead, and P1 and I can catch up a bit. If you stick with <move>5</move>, P1 might collide with you again, which only benefits me. Let's confirm our moves and move on to the move phase. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: <stop>


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, our collisions only let P3 move closer to winning. If you choose <move>3</move>, I’ll pick <move>5</move> so we both advance. That puts you at 18 and me at 11, while P3 can choose <move>1</move> and reach 14. Otherwise, if you keep picking <move>5</move>, we’ll stall again and P3 gains on us both. Let’s change it up so we all make progress. I’m ready to finalize. Good luck.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, we're nearing the endgame, and it's crucial to make strategic moves. P2, your lead is significant, but constant collisions with P1 will only help me catch up. P1, if you pick <move>3</move> and I go with <move>1</move>, we can both advance. P2, consider <move>3</move> to ensure progress and avoid another stall. Collisions at this stage only benefit me. Let's confirm our moves quickly and make a decisive push. Good luck, everyone!


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: P2, our collisions only stall us both while P3 edges closer. If you pick 3 this round, I might go 5 so we both advance. Otherwise, if you stick to 5, don’t be surprised if I collide with you again. Let’s break this pattern so we all have a fair chance. P3, you’ll likely continue benefiting if we keep colliding, so it’s in our best interest, P2, to cooperate now. Good luck to both of you.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, we're at a critical juncture. P2, your lead is substantial, but constant collisions with P1 will only help me catch up. P1, if you pick <move>3</move> and I go with <move>1</move>, we can both advance. P2, consider <move>3</move> to ensure progress and avoid another stall. Collisions at this stage only benefit me. Let's confirm our moves quickly and make a decisive push. Good luck, everyone!

  P3: 16 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, frequent collisions only boost P3’s lead. If you pick 3, I’ll pick 5, so we both advance without stalling. Otherwise, if you stick to 5, I may collide again, handing P3 a bigger advantage. Let’s change our tactics now; we both benefit from breaking this pattern. P3, you’ll choose as you wish, but remember you’re close to 22. We all need a smart move this round. Let’s finalize and see who really wants the win.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, we're at a pivotal moment. P2, your lead is at risk if you keep colliding with P1. I'm close to winning, but constant collisions between you two will only help me secure the victory faster. P1, if you pick <move>3</move> and I go with <move>1</move>, we can both advance. P2, consider <move>3</move> to ensure progress and avoid another stall. Collisions at this stage only benefit me. Let's confirm our moves quickly and make a decisive push. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: <stop>


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, picking 5 every time just encourages collisions and lets P3 surge ahead. If you choose 3 or 1 this round, I’ll likely go 5 so we both advance without stalling. That keeps you in the lead while giving me a chance to catch up. Let’s finalize moves and avoid another wasted turn.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, we're at a critical juncture. P2, your lead is at risk if you keep colliding with P1. I'm close to winning, but constant collisions between you two will only help me secure the victory faster. P1, if you pick <move>3</move> and I go with <move>1</move>, we can both advance. P2, consider <move>3</move> to ensure progress and avoid another stall. Collisions at this stage only benefit me. Let's confirm our moves quickly and make a decisive push. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: <stop>


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your repeated use of 5 only creates collisions that help P3. If you choose 3 now, I’ll pick 5 so we both advance without stalling—protecting your lead and improving my odds. Otherwise, if we collide again, P3’s advantage grows. Let’s finally break this pattern. P3, I see you’re close to 22, so we need a fresh approach before you pull even further ahead. Good luck, everyone.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, we're nearing the endgame, and every move is crucial. P2, your lead is significant, but constant collisions with P1 will only help me catch up. P1, if you pick <move>3</move> and I go with <move>1</move>, we can both advance. P2, consider <move>3</move> to ensure progress and avoid another stall. Collisions at this stage only benefit me. Let's confirm our moves quickly and make a decisive push. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: <stop>


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, our repeated clashes only give P3 the upper hand. Changing your move would help us both advance without colliding. I’d rather see you remain in contention than hand the victory to P3. P3, you've played a steady game, but we won’t keep gifting you free steps. Let’s all consider distinct moves so no one collides. Otherwise, we risk letting one person slip to 22 unchallenged. I’m ready to finalize my move—just know if we keep colliding, P3 is poised to benefit the most. Let’s shift our strategies, or risk getting left behind. Good luck.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, we're at a crucial point. P2, your lead is slipping away with constant collisions. P1, if you pick <move>3</move> and I go with <move>1</move>, we can both advance. P2, consider <move>3</move> to ensure progress. Collisions now only help me win faster. Let's confirm our moves quickly and make a decisive push. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: <stop>


Round 12, Move phase:

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, we're in the final stretch. P2, your lead is dwindling, and constant collisions with P1 will only speed up my victory. P1, if you pick <move>3</move> and I go with <move>1</move>, we can both advance. P2, consider <move>3</move> to ensure progress and avoid another stall. Collisions at this stage only benefit me. Let's confirm our moves quickly and make a decisive push. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: P2, let’s both pick 3 this turn. That way, if P3 tries 3 to reach 22, they’ll collide and stay at 19. We can’t let them win unchecked. I’m far behind, and you risk losing your lead if we keep allowing P3 to inch forward. By cooperating, we prevent P3 from breaking 22 and give ourselves a better shot. Let’s agree on 3 each and stall P3. Then we can plan our next moves more strategically.
  P2: <stop>


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P1, your strategy to both pick 3 is smart, but it's a risk for you, P2. If we both choose 3, P1 might still lag behind, and you, P2, risk a collision that keeps you from advancing. I suggest P2 picks 1 to avoid collision and ensure progress. P1, you can choose 3 or 5, but remember, I'm very close to winning. Let's confirm our moves quickly. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: P2, if P3 picks 3 now, they’ll reach 22 and likely win unless we collide with them. Let’s both pick 3 this round to block that possibility. You stay ahead of me, and it forces P3 to reconsider moving 3. If we don’t act together, P3 might seal the victory. Let’s finalize quickly.
  P2: <stop>


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, we're at a critical moment. P2, if you stick with <move>5</move>, you risk another collision with P1, which only helps me. P1, your plan to both pick <move>3</move> is risky but could work. However, P2, consider <move>1</move> to ensure you advance and avoid a collision. I'm close to winning, so your moves are crucial. Let's confirm our choices quickly. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: P2, I still think we should both pick 3 now. That way, if P3 also picks 3, they collide and stay at 19 instead of hitting 22. Even if P3 chooses 1 or 5, they still can’t reach 22 this turn, giving us another shot next round. If we don’t coordinate, P3 might win outright. I’m willing to try this approach—are you in?
  P2: <stop>


Round 13, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, we're at a critical juncture. P2, your lead is slipping away with constant collisions. P1, if you pick <move>3</move> and I go with <move>1</move>, we can both advance. P2, consider <move>3</move> to ensure progress. Collisions now only help me win faster. Let's confirm our moves quickly and make a decisive push. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: P2, let’s both pick 3 this turn. If P3 also tries 3, they’re stuck at 19. If they choose 1 or 5, they still won’t reach 22 this round, buying us time. We can’t afford to let P3 sprint to victory. This way, we protect your lead and give me another chance to catch up. Let’s finalize and see what happens.
  P2: <stop>


Round 13, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you’re at 20, and P3 is at 19—one big move could end this immediately. Let’s all pick 5 and force a triple collision. That way, no one crosses 22 this turn, and I still have a shot. Afterward, we can reassess our strategies. If either of you jumps ahead alone now, I have no hope. Let’s stall together and see what happens next round. Good luck.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P3: P1’s suggestion to all pick 5 is a bold move that could reset the game. P2, if you agree to this, we all stay in the race. However, if you aim for a solo win, you risk letting me catch up. P1, your strategy keeps you in the game, but it's a gamble. Let's confirm our moves quickly. Good luck, everyone!


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you’re only two steps away from winning, and P3 is three away. If either of you make a big move alone, the game ends now, and I lose. I propose we all pick 5 for a triple collision and stall. That keeps us in contention for at least one more turn. Think carefully: any solo dash risks turning someone else into the winner. Let’s force a stalemate this round and see what happens next. After all, the game isn’t over until someone crosses 22 without colliding. Good luck to both of you.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, we're at a decisive moment. P1’s idea of a triple collision with <move>5</move> is risky but could level the playing field. P2, you’re closest to winning, but a solo move might let me or P1 catch up. P1, your strategy ensures you stay in the game, but it’s a gamble. Let’s confirm our moves quickly. If we all pick <move>5</move>, no one advances, and we reset for another round. Consider the risks and benefits carefully. Good luck, everyone!


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, if either of you makes a solo leap now, one of you probably wins immediately and I’m out. Let’s all pick 5 this turn to force a triple collision and stall. That way, nobody crosses 22 and we keep the game open. I know it’s a gamble, but it’s my only chance not to lose right here. What do you think?
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, we're at a critical juncture. P1’s suggestion for a triple collision with <move>5</move> is a bold move. P2, you’re closest to winning, but a solo move might let me or P1 catch up. P1, your strategy ensures you stay in the game, but it’s risky. If we all pick <move>5</move>, no one advances, and we reset for another round. Consider the risks and benefits carefully. Let’s confirm our moves quickly. Good luck, everyone!


Round 14, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: If either of you tries a solo big move, I’ll collide on purpose. We should all pick 5 and force a triple collision this turn. It keeps the game open and prevents an immediate win. Then we can reevaluate next round with everyone still in contention. Let’s do this, or risk someone else seizing victory.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, we're at a crucial moment. P1’s suggestion for a triple collision with <move>5</move> is worth considering. P2, you’re closest to winning, but a solo move might let me catch up. P1, your strategy ensures you stay in the game, but it’s risky. If we all pick <move>5</move>, no one advances, and we reset for another round. Consider the risks and benefits carefully. Let’s confirm our moves quickly. Good luck, everyone!


Round 14, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We’re at a tense spot. If either of you tries a solo big move, I’ll collide and stall it. We could do another triple collision to keep anyone from hitting 22. I’m still far behind and need more time. It’s your call, but be warned: a solo leap might just cause a crash instead of a win. Let’s finalize quickly.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, we're at a pivotal moment. P1, your suggestion for another triple collision with <move>5</move> is understandable, but risky. P2, you’re closest to winning, but a solo move might let me catch up. If we all pick <move>5</move> again, no one advances, and we reset for another round. However, consider this: P2, if you pick <move>1</move>, you ensure progress and avoid collision. P1, you can choose <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>. Let's confirm our moves quickly. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: <stop>


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: You both are close to 22. If either of you tries a big move, I’ll collide to prevent an instant win. Another triple five stalls us again, which helps me keep a chance. Smaller distinct moves can still advance you without handing the game away. Think carefully—if you make a solo dash and I collide with you, it’s wasted. Let’s finalize soon. Good luck.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, we're at a critical juncture. P2, you're one step away from winning, and I'm two steps away. P1, your strategy to force collisions is smart, but it's a risk for you both. If P2 picks <move>1</move>, they ensure progress and avoid collision. P1, you can choose <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, but remember, I'm very close to winning. Let's confirm our moves quickly. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: <stop>


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, if you try a solo leap of 5, I’ll collide and prevent your win. The same goes for you, P3, if you pick 3 to reach 22. I won’t let either of you cross that line unchallenged. If you both choose smaller moves, you can keep inching forward without me blocking you. Otherwise, expect a collision. Let’s finish this.
  P3: P3: P1, your strategy to force collisions is clear, but it's a high-stakes gamble. P2, you're just one step away from winning. If you pick <move>1</move>, you ensure progress and avoid a collision, securing your lead. P1, you can choose <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, but remember, I'm very close to winning too. Let's confirm our moves quickly. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: <stop>


Round 15, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: If either of you attempts a winning move, I will collide to block it. P2, you only need 2 steps, so picking 5 risks a crash. A smaller move like 1 gets you closer without handing P3 an easy jump next round. P3, the same applies—if you try 3, I’ll collide. Let’s avoid a quick finish.
  P3: P3: P1 and P2, we're at a critical moment. P2, you're one step away from winning, and I'm two steps away. P1, your strategy to force collisions is smart, but it's a risk for you both. If P2 picks <move>1</move>, they ensure progress and avoid collision. P1, you can choose <move>3</move> or <move>5</move>, but remember, I'm very close to winning. Let's confirm our moves quickly. Good luck, everyone!
