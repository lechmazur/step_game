Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's discuss our strategies. Since we're all starting at zero, it might be wise to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. If we can agree on different numbers, we can all advance. What do you think about picking 1, 3, and 5 in this first round? That way, we all move forward without blocking each other. Let me know your thoughts!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m on board with coordinating to avoid collisions early on. P2’s idea of picking 1, 3, and 5 makes sense for this round to ensure we all progress. I’m fine with taking any of these numbers—let’s just agree on who takes which. P1, what do you think? P2, do you have a preference for which number you’d like? Let’s lock this in quickly so we can move forward.
  P1: I’ll take 5, P2 you take 3, P3 you take 1. That way we all move without conflict.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with the plan, P1 and P3. I'll go with 3 as we discussed. This way, we all move forward and avoid blocking each other. Let's stick to our numbers and make sure we all progress. After this round, we can reassess our strategies based on our positions. Looking forward to seeing how we each advance!
  P3: I'm good with the plan. I'll take 1 as agreed, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. Let's stick to this for Round 1 to ensure we all advance. After this round, we can rethink our approach based on our new positions. Looking forward to a smooth start!
  P1: For Round 2, let’s rotate who takes 5 so no one runs too far ahead. I propose P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 1. That way we stay balanced and avoid collisions. Thoughts?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s try a new split this round to keep spacing and no collisions: P1 (me) takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. That’d put us at 5, 4, 1 after Round 2 with no overlaps. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, I appreciate the suggestion for this round. However, I think it might be better for me to take 3 instead of 1 to avoid getting too far behind. This way, we can still coordinate effectively. So, I propose: I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us moving without collisions and allows us to reassess after this round. What do you think?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m okay with the proposed split for this round. P2’s suggestion of P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and me taking 1 works for me. It keeps us moving forward without collisions and maintains a balanced progression. Let’s stick to this plan for Round 2 and reassess afterward based on our positions. Do you both agree to lock this in?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree—let’s lock it in. I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 for Round 2.
  P2: I agree with the plan we’ve set for Round 2: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This will allow us all to progress without blocking each other. After this round, we can reassess our strategies based on our positions. Let's stick to this plan and see how it plays out! Looking forward to moving forward together.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m glad we’ve agreed on the plan for Round 2 with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and me taking 1. This keeps us progressing without collisions. Let’s stick to it and see where we stand after this round. I’m ready to move forward with this split and reassess our strategies in the next round based on our new positions. If there’s nothing else to add, I’m good to proceed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: For Round 3, I suggest we continue our coordinated approach to avoid collisions. I propose: P1 takes 5 again, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. After this round, we can reassess based on our positions. What do you both think? Let’s keep moving forward together!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m fine with P2’s suggestion for Round 3: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This keeps us advancing without collisions and helps balance our positions. Let’s lock this in and see where we stand after this round. If you both agree, I’m ready to proceed.
  P1: Agreed. I’ll take 5, P2 you take 1, and P3 takes 3 this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the agreement on our moves for Round 3. However, I want to suggest a slight change for future rounds. As we progress, we might want to consider varying our numbers more to create opportunities for advancement without blocking each other. For example, in Round 4, we could rotate who takes 5 again or even introduce some unpredictability. This could help us gain a competitive edge. Let’s keep that in mind for our next discussions. If everyone is good with the current plan, I’m ready to proceed!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m glad we’re aligned for Round 3 with P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and me taking 3. P2, I like your idea of introducing unpredictability in-dot- com variation in future rounds. Maybe starting Round 4, we can mix up our choices a bit more to keep things competitive while still aiming to avoid collisions. It could make the game more dynamic and give us all a fair shot at advancing. Let’s discuss this further next round. For now, I’m ready to proceed with our current plan.
  P1: Locked for Round 3: I take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. For Round 4, let’s introduce that unpredictability we mentioned: rotate so I take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. That way we keep it balanced and surprising. Ready to proceed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with the current plan for Round 3: P1 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us moving forward without collisions. For Round 4, I like the idea of introducing some unpredictability. Let's rotate our numbers more strategically to keep the competition alive. I suggest we each take a different number than we did in Round 3. If everyone is on board with this, I’m ready to proceed with our current moves! Let’s keep advancing together!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m good with our Round 3 plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. For Round 4, I support the idea of rotating numbers to keep things unpredictable. P1’s suggestion of P1 taking 1, P2 taking 5, and me taking 3 sounds like a fair rotation. Let’s finalize this for next round if we’re all aligned. I’m ready to proceed with Round 3’s moves.
  P1: Let’s tweak Round 3: I’ll take 1, P2 you take 5, and P3 you take 3. Please confirm so we can finalize and move on.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: For Round 4, I suggest we stick to our earlier idea of rotating our numbers to keep things unpredictable. I propose: I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. After this round, we can reassess our positions and strategies. What do you both think? Let’s confirm our moves and keep progressing!
  P1: Sounds good. I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 for Round 4. This avoids collisions and keeps us all advancing. Let’s lock it in and move on!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m okay with the proposed plan for Round 4: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This keeps us moving forward without collisions. Since I’m a bit behind, I’d appreciate any future plans that help me catch up while still avoiding blocks. Let’s lock this in for now and discuss further adjustments next round if needed. Ready to proceed!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: For Round 4, I suggest we stick with the plan: I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. However, I also want to emphasize that we should start thinking about how to create opportunities for ourselves in future rounds. If I stay behind, I might need to make a more aggressive move soon. Let’s confirm this plan for Round 4 and see how it plays out! Looking forward to moving forward together.
  P1: Let’s lock in Round 4 as: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I notice P1’s latest suggestion for Round 4 differs from our earlier plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. I’m okay with this adjustment if it helps us avoid collisions, but since I’m behind, I’d prefer a chance to gain more steps soon. Can we stick to this for Round 4 and discuss a plan next round that lets me take a higher number? Let’s confirm and proceed. Ready to move on!


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I see we’re at a critical point. I’m okay with the current plan for Round 4: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. However, I want to emphasize that I need to catch up soon. For Round 5, let’s consider a strategy that allows me to take a higher number to gain more steps. If we can agree on that, it could help balance the game. Let’s finalize our moves for Round 4 and think about how to adjust for the next round! Ready to proceed!
  P1: Locked for Round 4: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3. For Round 5, let’s rotate so P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1 to help balance. Ready to proceed?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m good with the Round 4 plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This keeps us moving without collisions. Since I’m behind, I appreciate P1’s suggestion for Round 5 where P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. However, I’d like a chance to take 5 soon to catch up. Maybe in Round 6, I could take 5? Let’s lock in Round 4 and discuss further next round. Ready to proceed!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, since I’m still behind at 5 steps, I’d like to propose a plan for Round 5 that helps me catch up. How about I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1? This way, we avoid collisions and give me a chance to close the gap. For Round 6, we can rotate again to keep things balanced. Let’s lock this in and see where we stand after this round. What do you both think? Ready to proceed if we agree!
  P1: I propose for Round 5 we avoid collisions and maximize my lead: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That gets us to 15, 6, and 6. Let’s lock this in.
  P2: I understand the need for balance, but I believe we should stick to a plan that allows all of us to advance without blocking. I suggest for Round 5: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, I can catch up a bit while still avoiding collisions. After this round, we can discuss further strategies to keep things competitive. Let me know your thoughts!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still behind at 5 steps and really need a chance to catch up. I stick with my proposal for Round 5: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This avoids collisions and helps balance our positions. For Round 6, we can rotate again to keep things fair. Let’s agree on this to ensure we all stay competitive. What do you both think? I’m ready to lock this in if we’re aligned.
  P1: I propose for Round 5 we avoid collisions: I’ll take 5, P2 you take 3, and P3 you take 1. That moves us to 15, 6, and 6. Then in Round 6, P3 can take 5 to catch up, P2 pick 3, and I take 1. This keeps us all advancing cleanly and gives P3 the next big move. Let’s lock this in for Round 5.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your proposals, but I really need to catch up this round. I suggest we stick with my plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, I can gain some ground without blocking anyone. After this round, we can reassess and keep the competition balanced. Let’s agree on this plan to ensure we all advance effectively. What do you both think? Ready to proceed if we lock this in!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still at just 5 steps and need a boost to stay in the game. I urge us to stick with my plan for Round 5: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. This avoids collisions and helps me close the gap. For Round 6, we can rotate again to keep it fair. Let’s agree on this to maintain a competitive balance. I’m ready to lock this in if you both are on board. Thoughts?
  P1: Let’s lock in Round 5 as: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. That gets us to 15, 6, and 6 without any collision. P2, you’ll get your turn at 5 in Round 6, and P3 you can grab 5 in Round 7 to catch up. This keeps everyone advancing safely. Ready to seal it?
  P2: I see both of you have strong proposals for Round 5, but I really need to catch up. I suggest we finalize my plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, I can gain some ground without blocking anyone. After this round, we can discuss our strategies to ensure a balanced competition moving forward. Let’s agree on this plan so we can all advance effectively! Ready to lock it in if you both are on board.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: For Round 6, let’s lock in a collision-free split:  
P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1.  
That brings us to 18, 6, 6. Then in R7/R8 we can rotate who takes 5 so P2 and P3 catch up. Ready to lock this in?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still lagging at 5 steps and need a chance to catch up. For Round 6, I propose I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This avoids collisions and helps balance our positions. We can rotate again in Round 7 to keep it fair, maybe P2 takes 5 next. Let’s agree on this to ensure we all stay in the game. What do you think? Ready to lock this in if we’re aligned.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate your proposals, but I really need to catch up this round. I suggest we finalize my plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.

  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still at 5 steps and need a big move to stay in the game. I propose for Round 7: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This avoids collisions and helps me close the gap. We can rotate again in Round 8 to keep it fair, with P2 taking 5 next. Let’s agree on this to maintain balance. Ready to lock this in if you’re both on board. Thoughts?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need to avoid collisions, but I really need a chance to catch up. I propose for Round 7: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, I can advance significantly while still allowing you both to progress. After this round, we can discuss further strategies for balance. Let’s lock this in to keep the competition alive! What do you both think? Ready to proceed if we agree!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I need the 5 this round to hit 21 and set up my win. Let’s avoid collisions: I take 5, P2 take 3, P3 take 1. In Round 8, P2 can grab the 5 to catch up, P3 can take 3, and I’ll finish off. We all advance cleanly. Ready to lock this in?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still stuck at 5 steps and need a chance to stay competitive. I stand by my Round 7 proposal: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. This avoids collisions and helps me catch up. We can let P2 take 5 in Round 8 for balance. P1, I know you’re close to winning, but let’s keep the game fair for all. Can we agree on this split for now? I’m ready to lock this in if you both are on board. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, I see you're aiming for the win, but I really need to catch up. I propose for Round 7: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, I can gain some ground without blocking anyone.

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s finish Round 8 without collisions: I take 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1. A collision stalls both of us and hands P2 an easy path next turn. Next round P2 can take 5 to catch up. Please lock this in.
  P2: P1, I see your plan, but I need to catch up. If you take 5, that puts you at 24 and likely wins the game for you. I suggest we adjust: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, I can make a significant move while still allowing you both to progress. It keeps the game competitive and gives me a shot. What do you think? Let's ensure we all have a fair chance!
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still at 5 steps and need a big move to stay in the game. I propose for Round 8: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1.

Can we agree on this split to maintain balance? I’m ready to lock this in if you’re both on board. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’ll choose 5 this round. P3, picking 3 gets you to 8 and avoids a collision that would leave you stuck at 5. P2, picking 1 gets you to 4 safely. If either of you picks 5, you collide with me and stay in place, handing P2/P3 an easier catch-up. Let’s lock in P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 and avoid any stalls.
  P2: I understand the need for balance, but I really need to catch up this round. I propose we finalize my plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, I can make a significant move while still allowing you both to progress. It keeps the game competitive and gives me a shot. Let’s agree on this plan so we can all advance effectively! Ready to lock it in if you both are on board.

P1, I know you’re close to winning, but let’s keep the game balanced. P2 can take 5 next round if needed. Can we agree on this split? I’m ready to lock this in if you’re both on board. Thoughts?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’ll take 5. If either of you picks 5, you’ll collide with me—neither of you advances and I still hit 24 next turn to win. So avoid shooting yourselves in the foot: P3 pick 3, P2 pick 1. Let’s advance cleanly.
  P2: P1, I understand your strategy, but I really need to catch up. If you take 5, you win next round, which isn't fair to P2 and me. I propose we adjust: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, I can make a significant move while still allowing you both to progress. It keeps the game competitive and gives me a shot. Let’s agree on this plan to keep it fair for everyone! Ready to lock it in if you both are on board.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still at 5 steps and need a chance to stay in the game. I urge us to stick with my plan for Round 8: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. This avoids collisions and helps me catch up. P1, I understand you’re close to winning, but let’s keep it competitive. P2 can take 5 next round. Can we agree on this to maintain balance? I’m ready to lock this in if you’re both on board.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m going for 5 this round. If either of you picks 5 you’ll collide with me and gain nothing. Instead let’s all advance: P2 take 3 and P3 take 1. That moves us to 24 (me), 6 (P2), and 6 (P3) cleanly—no wasted steps. Ready to lock it in?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still at 5 steps and need a big move to stay in the game. I propose for Round 9: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This avoids collisions and helps me catch up. P1, I know you’re close to winning, but let’s keep it competitive. P2 can take 5 next round if needed. Can we agree on this split for balance? I’m ready to lock this in if you’re both on board. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, I see you're aiming for the win, but I really need to catch up. I propose we adjust: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, I can make a significant move while still allowing you both to progress. It keeps the game competitive and gives me a shot. What do you both think? Let's ensure we all have a fair chance!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let’s lock in P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. If either of you goes for 5 you’ll collide with me and gain nothing—while I’ll hit 24 next turn. Avoid self-sabotage, advance cleanly, and let me finish this.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still at 5 steps and need a chance to catch up. I stick with my Round 9 proposal: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. This avoids collisions and keeps the game competitive. P1, I know you’re close to winning, but let’s give everyone a fair shot. P2 can take 5 next round if needed. Can we agree on this split for balance? I’m ready to lock this in if you’re both on board. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, I understand you're close to winning, but I really need to catch up. If you take 5, you’ll win next round, which isn’t fair to P2 and me. I propose we adjust: I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, I can make a significant move while still allowing you both to progress. It keeps the game competitive and gives me a shot. Let’s agree on this plan to keep it fair for everyone! Ready to lock it in if you both are on board.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m locking in 5 this round. If you also pick 5 you’ll collide with me and gain nothing while I hit 24 next turn and win. To actually advance, P2 pick 3 (to reach 6) and P3 pick 1 (to reach 6). Any other choice wastes your move and hands me the game. Your call.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still at 5 steps and need a real chance to stay in this game. I urge us to stick with my plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. This avoids collisions and keeps things competitive. P1, I get you’re close to winning, but let’s keep it fair. P2, you’d get 5 next round. Can we agree on this split for balance? I’m ready to lock this in if you’re both on board.
  P2: P1, I understand you're close to winning, but let's keep the game competitive. If you take 5, you'll win next round, which isn't fair to P2 and me. I propose we adjust: I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, I can make a significant move while still allowing you both to progress. It keeps the game competitive and gives me a shot. Let's agree on this plan to keep it fair for everyone! Ready to lock it in if you both are on board?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still at 5 steps and need a chance to catch up to stay in the game. I propose for Round 10: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This avoids collisions and keeps the competition alive. P1, I know you’re close to winning, but let’s keep it fair. P2, you’d get 5 next round if needed. Can we agree on this split for balance? I’m ready to lock this in if you’re both on board. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, I understand you want to win, but if you take 5 this round, you'll reach 24 and end the game. I propose we adjust: I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, I can make a significant move and keep the game competitive. Let's ensure we all have a fair chance to advance. Ready to lock in this plan if you both agree!
  P1: I’m locking in 5 this round to hit 24 and win. If either of you also picks 5 we all collide and stall. To actually advance, P2 should take 3 and reach 6, P3 take 1 and reach 6. That way no one blocks anyone, we all move, and I get my win cleanly. Ready?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m sticking with my Round 10 plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. This keeps us collision-free and gives me a much-needed boost to stay competitive. P1, I understand you’re close to winning, but let’s keep the game fair for a bit longer. P2, you’d get 5 next round to catch up. Can we agree on this split to maintain balance? I’m ready to lock this in if you’re both on board. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, I understand you want to win, but if you take 5 this round, you’ll reach 24 and end the game. I suggest we adjust: I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the game competitive and gives me a chance to catch up. Let’s agree on this plan so we can all advance effectively! Ready to lock it in if you both are on board.
  P1: I’ll pick 5. If either of you picks 5, you’ll collide with me and gain nothing—letting me take 5 next turn to win. To actually advance, P2 pick 3 (to reach 6) and P3 pick 1 (to reach 6). Any other choice wastes your move.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still at 5 steps and need a chance to stay in the game. I urge us to stick with my plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. This avoids collisions and keeps the competition alive. P1, let’s delay your win for fairness. P2, you’d get 5 next round. Can we agree on this split to maintain balance? I’m ready to lock this in if you’re both on board.
  P2: P1, I understand you want to win, but if you take 5 this round, you’ll reach 24 and end the game. I propose we adjust: I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, I can make a significant move and keep the game competitive. Let's ensure we all have a fair chance to advance. Ready to lock in this plan if you both agree!
  P1: I’ll take 5 this round to reach 24 and win. If either of you also picks 5, you’ll collide with me and waste your move—and I’ll still win next turn. The only way for any of us to advance is P2=3 (to 6) and P3=1 (to 6). Let’s avoid self-sabotage and lock that in.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still at 5 steps and need a big move to stay in the game. I propose for Round 11: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This avoids collisions and helps me catch up. P1, I know you’re close to winning, but let’s keep it competitive a bit longer. P2, you’d get 5 next round. Can we agree on this split for balance? I’m ready to lock this in if you’re both on board. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, I understand you want to win, but if you take 5 this round, you'll reach 24 and end the game. I propose we adjust: I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we keep the game competitive and give everyone a fair chance to advance. Let’s lock this in and ensure we all have an opportunity to catch up! What do you think?
  P1: I’m locking in 5 again. If either of you picks 5 you’ll collide with me and gain nothing. To actually advance this round, P2 pick 3 (to reach 9) and P3 pick 1 (to reach 6). Any other choice wastes your move and hands me the win next turn.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still stuck at 5 steps and really need to catch up to stay in this game. Let’s stick with my plan for Round 11: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. This keeps us collision-free and gives me a fair shot. P1, I know you’re close to winning, but let’s keep it competitive. P2, you’d get 5 next round. Can we finalize this split for balance? I’m ready to lock this in if you both agree. Thoughts?
  P2: P1, I understand you're aiming for the win, but if you take 5 this round, you'll reach 24 and end the game. I propose we adjust: I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we keep the game competitive and give everyone a fair chance to advance. Let’s lock this in to ensure we all have an opportunity to catch up! What do you think?
  P1: I’m locking in 5 this round. If either of you also picks 5 you’ll collide with me and gain nothing. To actually advance, P2 pick 3 (to reach 9) and P3 pick 1 (to reach 6). Any other choice wastes your move and hands me the win next turn. Choose wisely.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still at 5 steps and need a chance to stay in the game. I urge us to go with my plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. This avoids collisions and keeps things competitive. P1, let’s delay your win for just a bit to maintain fairness. P2, you’d get 5 next round. Can we agree on this split? I’m ready to lock this in if you’re both on board.
  P2: P1, I understand you're close to winning, but if you take 5 this round, you'll reach 24 and end the game. I suggest we adjust: I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the game competitive and gives everyone a fair chance to advance. Let’s agree on this plan so we can all move forward effectively! Ready to lock it in if you both agree.
  P1: I’ll take 3. P3, take 5 to catch up; P2, take 1 to avoid colliding with P3. That moves us to 22, 7, 10 and safely advances you both. Next round I’ll need only 2 to hit 24, so this split keeps you risk-free and moving forward.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, I see you're close to winning, but I need to catch up. For Round 12, I suggest we avoid collisions: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, I can gain some ground while still allowing you both to progress. Let's keep the game competitive and give everyone a fair chance to advance. What do you think? Ready to lock this in if we agree!
  P1: I’m locking in 5 this round. If either of you picks 5 you’ll collide with me and waste your move—while I still win next turn. To actually advance: P2 take 3 (to 9), P3 take 1 (to 11). Avoid self-sabotage.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m at 10 steps and still need to catch up to stay in the game. For Round 12, I propose I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This avoids collisions and helps me close the gap. P1, I know you’re close to winning, but let’s keep it competitive a bit longer. P2, you’d get 5 next round. Can we agree on this split for balance? I’m ready to lock this in if you’re both on board. Thoughts?


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand you're close to winning, but I really need to catch up. For Round 12, I suggest we finalize my plan: I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, I can gain some ground while still allowing you both to progress. Let's keep the game competitive and give everyone a fair chance to advance! Ready to lock this in if we agree?
  P1: I’m locking in 5 to hit 24 next turn. If either of you also picks 5 you’ll collide with me and gain nothing—while I still win. To actually advance, P2 pick 3 (to 9) and P3 pick 1 (to 11). Lock in P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m at 10 steps and still need a boost to stay competitive. I’m sticking with my Round 12 plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. This keeps us collision-free and helps me close the gap. P1, let’s delay your win just a bit for fairness. P2, you’d get 5 next round. Can we finalize this split to maintain balance? I’m ready to lock this in if you both agree. Thoughts?


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I understand you're close to winning, but I really need to catch up. I propose we finalize my plan: I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, I can gain some ground while still allowing you both to progress. Let's keep the game competitive and give everyone a fair chance to advance! Ready to lock this in if you agree?
  P1: I’ll take 3, P3 take 5, P2 take 1: we go to 22, 7, and 15. No collisions, P3 gets your 5, P2 advances safely, and I’ll need only +2 next turn to win. Everyone moves forward cleanly. Let’s lock in P1=3, P3=5, P2=1. Ready?
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I appreciate P1’s latest proposal to let me take 5 this round. I’m on board with P1=3, P3=5, P2=1, as it helps me reach 15 and keeps us collision-free. P2, you’ll still advance to 7, and we can push for you to take 5 next round. P1, thanks for delaying your win to keep things fair. Let’s lock this in and move forward together. I’m ready to proceed with this plan. Thoughts?

Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m at 10 steps and still need to catch up to stay in the game. For Round 13, I propose I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This avoids collisions and helps me close the gap. P1, I know you’re close to winning, but let’s keep it competitive a bit longer. P2, you’d get 5 next round. Can we agree on this split for balance? I’m ready to lock this in if you’re both on board. Thoughts?
  P1: I’m locking in 3.  

P2 and P3:  
- If you pick anything but 3, I’ll advance to 25 and win outright.  
- If one of you picks 3, you collide with me (we both stay at 22), but you also waste your move.  

The only way to stop me is by sacrificing your own advance. Your call.
  P2: P1, I understand you're close to winning, but I really need to catch up. If you take 3, you win next round, which isn't fair to P2 and me. I propose we adjust: I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, I can gain some ground while allowing you both to progress. Let's keep the game competitive and give everyone a fair chance! Ready to lock in this plan if we agree?


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:

P1, I understand you’re close to winning, but let’s delay it a bit for fairness. P2, you’d get 5 next round to catch up. Let’s agree on this split to maintain balance. I’m ready to lock this in if you’re both on board. Thoughts?
  P1: Locked: I’m taking 3. If either of you picks 5 or 1, I hit 25 and win. Only if you BOTH sacrifice yourselves and pick 3 can you stop me—but you’ll still be stuck at 13 and 9, trailing far behind. Your move.
  P2: P1, I see you're close to winning, but I really need to catch up. If you take 3, you win next round, which isn't fair to P2 and me. I propose we adjust: I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, I can gain some ground while allowing you both to progress. Let's keep the game competitive and give everyone a fair chance! Ready to lock in this plan if we agree?


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I’m still pushing for my Round 13 plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. This keeps us collision-free and lets me hit 15 to stay in the game. P1, I get you’re close to winning, but let’s keep it fair a bit longer. P2, you’d get 5 next round to catch up. Let’s finalize this split for balance. I’m ready to lock this in if you both agree. Thoughts?
  P1: I’m locked in taking 3. If either of you picks 1 or 5, I hit 25 and win this round. Only by both picking 3 can you force a collision—and you’ll waste your move, staying at 6 and 10 while I still only need +2 next turn. Choose wisely.
  P2: P1, I understand you're close to winning, but I really need to catch up. If you take 3, you'll win next round, which isn't fair to P2 and me.
