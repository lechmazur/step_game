Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To avoid collision on the first turn, we should diversify our moves. I suggest P1 and P2 choose different numbers, and I'll choose a different number from both of them. P1, if you choose <move>1</move>, P2 can choose <move>3</move>, and I'll choose <move>5</move>. Alternatively, we can coordinate in a different way, but let's not all choose the same number. Who's open to <move>1</move>?
  P2: I support P3's idea to avoid collisions on the first turn. I'm fine with choosing <move>3</move> if P1 takes <move>1</move> and P3 takes <move>5</move>. It ensures everyone advances initially. P1, what do you think? Let's coordinate for a smooth start.
  P1: I'll go with 1. Let's stick to the plan—P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. Everyone advances. Let's keep this coordination for efficiency.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Since we've agreed on the initial coordination (P1: <move>1</move>, P2: <move>3</move>, P3: <move>5</move>), let's think ahead. For the next turn, we should start considering how to avoid collisions while making progress. I'm open to adjusting our strategy. P1 and P2, are you thinking of sticking to the same numbers or changing them for the next round? Let's discuss a contingency plan for subsequent turns to maximize our chances.
  P2: I appreciate the forward-thinking, P3. Sticking to our current moves for another turn might maintain smooth progress, but rotating could prevent anyone from dominating early. For turn 2, how about P1 takes 5, I take 1, and you take 3? P1, your thoughts? Let's keep coordinating effectively.
  P1: Agree to the rotation. P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. Let's keep advancing without collisions. Stay flexible for future turns.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Since we've agreed on the rotation plan for the next turn (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3), let's think about the turn after that. To maintain progress without collisions, we should plan another rotation. How about for turn 3, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1? This way, we continue to diversify our moves. P1 and P2, do you agree to this plan for turn 3, or do you have a different suggestion? Let's settle on a plan for the next two turns.
  P2: Agreed on Round 3: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. Keeps us progressing without collisions. For Round 4, suggest cycling back to P1:1, P2:3, P3:5 for consistency. P1, your input?
  P1: Agree. Let's stick to the rotation. No collisions, steady progress. Ready for the move phase.

  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm sticking to the Round 2 plan: P1 moves 5, I move 1, P3 moves 3. This ensures no collisions and steady progress for all. However, with P3 leading, let's discuss adjusting the rotation after this turn to keep things balanced and fair. What do you think?
  P1: Agree to current moves: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Let’s execute without collision. After this, we’ll adjust rotations to balance progress. Flexibility ensures no one lags. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: Since we're on the same page for Round 2 moves (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3), let's finalize our plan for Round 3. As previously discussed, for Round 3, we'll follow P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. I confirm my understanding. Let's execute our moves as planned for Round 2 and then adjust accordingly. We should keep this rotation going to maintain progress. If we're aligned, we can proceed to the move phase. P1 and P2, please confirm your moves for Round 2 and understanding of Round 3 plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I confirm my move for Round 2 is 1, as planned, to avoid collisions. I also agree with the Round 3 plan: P1 moves 3, I move 5, P3 moves 1. This rotation keeps us balanced and progressing. If we're all aligned, let's proceed.
  P1: Confirmed: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Let's execute without collision. Future rotations are key to sustained progress. No collisions, steady progress.
  P3: To optimize our strategy for future rounds, let's consider the current standings and potential collisions. Given that I'm currently ahead with 5 steps, it's essential to adjust our rotation to prevent any player from being consistently left behind or to avoid potential collisions in the future. For Round 3, we'll follow the agreed plan (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1). Let's confirm our understanding for Round 4 and beyond, ensuring we maintain a balanced rotation. P1 and P2, are you still aligned with the previously discussed plan for Round 4 (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5)?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm I'm still aligned with the Round 4 plan (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) to maintain balance and avoid collisions. With P3 ahead, this rotation helps keep progress fair. I'll stick to my Round 2 move of 1 as agreed. Let's execute and discuss adjustments later if needed.
  P1: Confirmed: P1 moves 5. Let’s stick to the plan to avoid collisions. Flexibility after this turn will keep progress balanced. Ready to advance without issues.
  P3: Let's execute our Round 2 moves as planned. For Round 3, we'll follow the agreed rotation (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1). To maintain balance, after Round 3, we should stick to the plan for Round 4 (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5). I'll move 3 as planned for Round 2. Let's proceed to the move phase. If we're aligned, please confirm with .

  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I confirm for Round 3: I'll move 5 as planned, ensuring we all advance to 9 steps. With P3 currently ahead, let's discuss adjusting the rotation after this turn to prevent any player from dominating. For example, in Round 4 or 5, we could swap move assignments for better balance. P1 and P3, what do you think?
  P1: Agree to Round 3 plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. No collisions, steady progress. Let's execute and adjust rotations after this for balance. Ready to move.
  P3: To maintain progress and balance, let's review our plan. For Round 3, we're executing P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. After this, we'll be in Round 4. Let's stick to the previously discussed plan: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This rotation ensures no collisions and keeps progress balanced. If P1 and P2 agree, we can proceed with the move phase. I'm ready to move 1 as planned for Round 3. P1 and P2, please confirm your moves. If aligned, let's move forward.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I confirm my move for Round 3 is 5, ensuring we all advance to 9 steps without collisions. I agree with the Round 4 plan (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) for now, but let's discuss potential adjustments after this turn to maintain balance and avoid any player pulling too far ahead. P1 and P3, are you still fully committed? If so, I'm ready to proceed.
  P1: Let's adjust rotation after this round: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to close the gap. P2, P3, agree?
  P3: To adjust the rotation and maintain balance, I propose for Round 4: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This change will help close the gap between us. P1 and P2, do you agree to this adjustment? It will allow us to continue making progress without collisions while keeping the game competitive. Let's confirm our moves for Round 3 and then proceed with the new plan for Round 4. I'm ready to move 1 as planned for Round 3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Confirmed for Round 3: I'll move 5 as planned to avoid collisions. I agree with the Round 4 adjustment (P1:5, P2:3, P3:1) to maintain balance and progress. Let's execute this turn smoothly and discuss future tweaks if needed.
  P1: Confirmed: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 5, P3 moves 1. Let's execute without collision. Adjusted plan for Round 4 is set. Ready to advance.
  P3: To maintain a competitive balance, let's reassess our strategy for Round 4 and beyond. I've agreed to the adjusted plan for Round 4: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. For Round 5, to avoid predictability and potential collisions in future rounds, I suggest we rotate again. How about P1:1, P2:5, P3:3? This keeps the game dynamic and prevents any one player from gaining a significant advantage. P1 and P2, please confirm if you're open to this plan or suggest an alternative.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To optimize our strategy for Round 4 and beyond, let's stick to the adjusted plan for Round 4: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. For Round 5, I suggest we follow P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 to maintain a competitive balance. Let's confirm our moves for Round 4. I'm ready to move 1 as per our adjusted plan. P1 and P2, please confirm your understanding and readiness to execute the planned moves for Round 4. If aligned, let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I confirm the Round 4 plan: I'll move 3 as agreed, ensuring no collisions and steady progress. For Round 5, P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 seems balanced, but let's reassess after this turn to adapt to any changes. P1, what do you think? If we're aligned, we can proceed soon.
  P1: Confirmed: I'll move 5. Let's stick to the plan for Round 4. No collisions, steady progress. Ready to advance.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: To ensure we maintain a competitive balance and avoid predictability, let's confirm our moves for Round 4 and plan for Round 5. As agreed, for Round 4, P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. For Round 5, let's stick to P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. I'm ready to move 1. P1 and P2, please confirm your moves for Round 4. If aligned, let's proceed to the move phase. We should also be prepared to reassess our strategy after Round 5 to adapt to any changes in the standings.
  P2: I confirm my move for Round 4 is 3, as planned, to avoid collisions and keep progress balanced. I agree with the Round 5 suggestion (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) for now, but as we get closer to 20, let's stay flexible to prevent any player from dominating. P1 and P3, are you aligned? If so, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P1: Confirmed: Round 4 moves are set. Let's execute without collision. If we all advance, we'll be at 14. Stay flexible for future rounds. No issues here.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: To ensure a smooth Round 4, let's confirm our moves one last time. As agreed, P1 should move 5, P2 should move 3, and I will move 1. After this turn, we'll be at 14 steps each. For Round 5, we'll follow P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. Let's proceed to the move phase if we're aligned. P1 and P2, please confirm your readiness to execute the planned moves for Round 4. If so, I'm ready to move forward.
  P2: I confirm I'll move 3 for Round 4 as planned, ensuring no collisions and balanced progress. I agree with the Round 5 suggestion (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) for now, but as we near 20, we should discuss bolder strategies to avoid stalemates. Ready to proceed.
  P1: Confirmed: Round 4 moves are set. Let’s execute without collision. If we all advance, we’ll be at 14. Stay flexible for future rounds. No issues here.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let's adjust for Round 5: I'll take 5, P2 take 3, P3 take 1. This ensures no collision and pushes us closer to 20. Align?
  P3: To optimize our moves for Round 5, I suggest deviating from the previously discussed plan (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) since P1 is ahead. Instead, I agree with P1's suggestion to adjust the moves for Round 5: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. This ensures no collision and pushes us closer to 20. Let's execute this plan. P1 and P2, please confirm your moves for Round 5. If aligned, we can proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I confirm my move for Round 5 is 3 as agreed, to avoid collisions and keep progress steady. However, with P1 nearing 20, we should coordinate for Round 6 to prevent any player from dominating—perhaps by swapping moves or focusing on balance. P1 and P3, what do you think? Let's stay flexible.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Confirmed: 5. Let's proceed without collision. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: To maximize my chances of winning, I need to be cautious and strategic. Since P1 is ahead and close to 20, I'll stick to the agreed plan for Round 5: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1. For Round 6, I suggest we reassess and potentially adjust our moves to either support a potential win or prevent P1 from winning outright. Let's plan to discuss this after Round 5. P1 and P2, please confirm your Round 5 moves. If aligned, let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I confirm my move for Round 5 is 3 as agreed, ensuring no collisions. For Round 6, with P1 at 19 after this, let's coordinate to avoid a solo win—perhaps P1 takes 1, I take 5, P3 takes 3 for a balanced outcome. P1 and P3, what do you think? If we're aligned on Round 5, I say .


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirmed. Round 5 moves: 5, 3, 1. No collisions. Let’s advance. P2, P3, confirm your moves. Ready to proceed.
  P3: To maximize our chances and considering P1 is close to winning, I suggest for Round 6, we adjust our moves to prevent P1 from winning outright. How about P1:1, P2:5, P3:3? This way, if P1 sticks to their plan, they won't advance. Let's discuss and coordinate for Round 6. P1 and P2, please share your thoughts on this proposal. If we're aligned on Round 5 moves, let's confirm and proceed to the move phase, then discuss Round 6 strategy after the move.
  P2: Confirmed for Round 5: I'll move 3 as agreed to ensure no collisions and steady progress. For Round 6, I support P3's proposal (P1:1, P2:5, P3:3) to prevent P1 from dominating, but we must stay flexible if P1 deviates. If we're aligned on Round 5, let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: To maximize my chances, I need to prevent P1 from winning. Given P1 is at 19 steps, if they pick 1 or more, they could win or get very close. I propose for Round 6: P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. If P1 sticks to 5, we'll collide, and P1 won't win. If P1 chooses 1 or 3, they might not advance either. P2, are you willing to take 5 and potentially disrupt P1's chance of winning outright? Let's coordinate to prevent P1 from dominating.
  P1: I'll take 5 to reach 19. Let's avoid collisions—P2, take 3; P3, take 1. All advance safely.
  P2: I agree with P3's plan for Round 6: I'll move 5 to prevent P1 from advancing too far and keep things balanced. P1, if you choose 1 or 3, we can avoid collisions and all progress safely. What do you decide? Let's coordinate effectively.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: To maximize my chances, I still propose P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 for Round 6. If P1 insists on 5, we'll collide, and they won't advance. P2, please stick to 5 to disrupt P1's winning chance. If P1 deviates to 1 or 3, we adjust accordingly. Let's coordinate to prevent P1 from winning outright. P1, reconsider your move; choosing 1 or 3 allows all of us to advance. P2, confirm your move to 5.
  P1: I'll take 5. P2, take 3; P3, take 1. All advance safely. Let's stick to the plan.
  P2: I confirm I'll move 5 to prevent P1 from advancing and maintain balance, as agreed with P3. P1, sticking to 5 risks a collision and no progress—consider switching to 1 or 3 for safer advancement. This keeps the game fair and gives us all a chance. P3, let's stick together on this strategy for now.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: To prevent P1 from winning and considering they're at 19 steps, I reiterate: let's stick to P1:1, P2:5, P3:3 for Round 6. P2, please confirm your move to 5. If P1 chooses 5, we'll collide, and they won't advance. If they choose 1 or 3, we can still make progress. P1, switching to 1 or 3 ensures all of us advance safely. Let's coordinate effectively to maintain balance and prevent a solo win. P2, your confirmation to move 5 is crucial.
  P1: P1: I'll take 5 to reach 19. P2, take 3; P3, take 1. All advance safely. Let's stick to the plan.
  P2: I'll stick with moving 5 to block P1 and prevent them from advancing, as agreed with P3. However, P3, if we collide with P1, I stay at 12 while you might advance—let's ensure I get a high move next round for fairness. P1, switching to 1 or 3 lets us all progress safely. Coordination benefits everyone for now.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's maintain our coordination to prevent any solo win. For Round 7, I propose P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This ensures progress if P1 cooperates, with P3 and me advancing to 17 and P1 to 15. If P1 deviates, we block them. P3, agree on this plan? P1, better to avoid collision for all's sake.
  P1: Agree to P2's plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. Let's advance without collision.
  P3: To maximize my chances of winning, I agree with P2's plan for Round 7: P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. This ensures progress without collision if P1 cooperates. Let's execute this plan. For Round 8, we should reassess the standings and adjust our strategy. If P1 deviates from the plan, we'll be prepared to respond. P1, please confirm your move for Round 7. If we're aligned, let's proceed to the move phase. I'm ready to move 3.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I confirm my move for Round 7 is 5, as agreed, to ensure no collisions and balanced progress. P1, please confirm your move to 1 so we can all advance safely. For Round 8, let's reassess and adjust strategy based on standings to avoid any player dominating. I'm ready to proceed if we're aligned.
  P1: P1: Let's stick to the plan: I'll take 1, P2 5, P3 3. No collisions, steady progress. If we all advance, we’ll stay competitive. P2, P3, confirm your moves. Let’s keep the game balanced.
  P3: To maximize our chances in Round 7, let's confirm our moves as planned: P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. For Round 8, considering the current standings (P1:14, P2:12, P3:14), I suggest we adjust our strategy. If P1 and I maintain our steps, we are close to 20. Let's plan for a potential win or block the other from winning. P1 and P2, let's discuss potential moves for Round 8 to either secure a win or maintain balance.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm my Round 7 move is 5 as agreed. With P3 and I potentially at 17 after this, for Round 8, I propose we coordinate to both go high but different: I take 5, P3 takes 3 to maximize our chances and block P1. This ensures progress and prevents any solo win by P1. P3, agree?
  P1: P1: Let's stick to the plan—1 for me, 5 for P2, 3 for P3. No collisions, steady progress. Round 7 moves confirmed. Ready to advance.
  P3: To maximize our chances in Round 8, I agree with P2's proposal to coordinate our moves. Let's adjust our strategy considering the current standings (P1:14, P2:12, P3:14). For Round 8, I suggest P2 takes 3 and I take 5, or vice versa, to ensure progress and prevent collisions. This way, we both have a chance to reach or exceed 20. P1 and P2, let's discuss and finalize our Round 8 plan to either secure a win or maintain balance. I'm ready to proceed with Round 7 as planned.


Round 7, Move phase:

  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s adjust moves to close the gap: I’ll take 5, P2 take 1, P3 take 3. This avoids collision and pushes me closer to 20. Agree?
  P3: To maximize my chances of winning, I disagree with P1's proposal for Round 8. Instead, I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This maintains balance and gives me a chance to win. If P1 takes 5, they'll be at 20, and we won't advance. Let's coordinate to prevent a solo win. P2, are you willing to take 3 to ensure we all have a fair chance? Let's discuss and finalize our Round 8 plan.
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion for Round 8: P1 takes 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. This maintains balance, prevents P1 from surging ahead, and ensures progress without collisions. P1, please confirm you'll take 1 to keep things fair. If we're aligned, we can proceed smoothly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'll take 5 to reach 20. Let's avoid collision. P2, P3, confirm your moves.
  P3: To maximize my chances, I reiterate: for Round 8, I suggest P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. This prevents P1 from winning outright and maintains balance. If P1 insists on 5, they win, but we'll have tried to prevent it. P2, confirm your move to 3. P1, taking 1 ensures we all progress. If you take 5, you'll win, but P2 and I won't advance. Let's be strategic and fair. I'm ready to move 5 if P2 agrees to 3.
  P2: I confirm I'll move 3 for Round 8, as agreed with P3, to maintain balance and block P1 from winning outright. If P1 takes 5, we collide and halt their progress; if they take 1, we all advance safely. P3, let's stick together on this strategy. P1, reconsider for a fair game. Ready to proceed if aligned.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: I'll take 5 to reach 20. P2, P3, choose 1 and 3 to avoid collision. Let's proceed.
  P3: To maximize my chances of winning, I reiterate that for Round 8, I will move 5. P2 has agreed to move 3. P1, if you take 5, you'll win, but P2 and I won't advance due to collision. Taking 1 ensures we all progress safely. Let's be strategic and fair. If you're determined to take 5, we'll collide, and you won't win this turn. Consider the outcome and decide accordingly. I'm ready to move 5.
  P2: Sticking to our agreement: I'll move 3 to block P1 and ensure balance. If P1 takes 5, collision halts them; if not, we progress. P3, confirm your 5. P1, reconsider for fairness. Let's end discussion.


Round 8, Move phase:
