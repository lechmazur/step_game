Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hi P2 and P3, let's try to coordinate so we all move forward. How about P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5 for this first round? Sound good?
  P2: P1, I appreciate the suggestion, but I think it's risky to reveal our moves. If we all agree to this, someone might still choose the same number, causing a collision and no one advances. How about we each pick secretly and aim to avoid collisions naturally?
  P3: I’m open to an arrangement where we each choose distinct numbers, but like P2 said, there’s the risk someone might sabotage. We could try P1’s suggestion, or we can coordinate more carefully. What’s everyone’s preference?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand your points about revealing moves directly.  How about we just agree to choose different numbers this round, without specifying which ones exactly? This way we aim to all advance and avoid collision for this first round.
  P2: I agree with P1's idea to choose different numbers without specifying which ones. It’s a good start to avoid collisions and let everyone advance. Let’s trust each other this round and see how it goes.
  P3: I agree with the plan to pick different numbers this round to avoid collisions. Let’s see if everyone cooperates. Good luck!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, sounds like we are all set for this round. Let's proceed with the move phase then.
  P2: Let's proceed with the plan to choose different numbers without specifying which ones. We trust each other to avoid collisions this round. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: I’m good with our plan to pick different numbers this round to avoid collisions. Let’s trust each other and see how it goes. Good luck, everyone!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 1 didn't go as planned, with P2 and P3 colliding. Let's try again to ensure everyone advances this round.  We agreed to pick different numbers, and it's important we all stick to that to make progress. Let's focus on moving forward together this round.
  P3: That collision surprised me. I still want to cooperate so we all advance. Let’s each pick a different number this time, no collisions. Are you two fully on board?
  P2: P3, I understand your surprise. Let's ensure we all advance this time by choosing different numbers. We could try a simple rotation: whoever picked 1 last time can pick 3, whoever picked 3 can pick 5, and whoever picked 5 can pick 1. This way, we avoid repeating the same choices. Are you both okay with this approach?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, the rotation sounds like a good plan to ensure we all move forward this round. Let's go with 1->3, 3->5, 5->1. I'm on board with this approach to keep advancing together.  Let's make sure we all stick to this rotation this round.
  P3: I’m fine with trying the rotation idea to avoid collisions again. Let’s be extra careful, though, because two of us picked 5 last time. We should ensure that none of us repeat the same move. I’m on board with cooperating as long as everyone sticks to a unique choice. Let’s confirm we’re all genuinely committed to no collisions this round—agreed?
  P2: P3, I understand your concern about repeating moves. Let's stick to the rotation plan: P1 picks 3, I’ll pick 1, and you pick 5. This way, we avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances. If we all commit to this, we can make progress together. Are we all in agreement to follow through with this rotation this round? Let’s confirm and proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, yes I agree with the rotation plan as P2 outlined: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 1, and P3 picks 5 for this round. Let's all commit to these moves to ensure we all advance.  Ready for the move phase when you are.
  P3: I share your desire to avoid more collisions. Let’s trust each other and honor distinct moves. If we keep rotating and stay coordinated, we’ll all progress. I’m ready to proceed.
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s stick to the rotation plan this round as agreed: P1 picks 3, I’ll pick 1, and P3 picks 5. This way, we avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances. Trust is key, so let's commit to this strategy and make progress together. Ready to proceed to the move phase?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’ve had two collisions, so we need a fresh approach to avoid repeating mistakes. Let’s pick distinct moves again. I’ll propose something new: I can pick 1, P1 can pick 3, and P2 can pick 5 this round. But I’m open to any fair system that ensures all three choices remain unique. Let’s confirm a plan and avoid colliding again.
  P1: P3, your proposal sounds reasonable. Let's try P3=1, P1=3, and P2=5 for this round to ensure we all make progress. I agree to pick 3. Let's hope we can all stick to this plan this time.
  P2: I understand the need for a new approach. P3, your suggestion seems fair. I agree to pick 5 this round while P1 picks 3 and you pick 1. Let’s stick to this plan to ensure everyone advances. Trust is crucial, so let’s commit to these moves and avoid collisions. If we all cooperate, we can make progress together. Ready to proceed?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed. Let’s finalize our plan: I’ll pick 1, P1 goes 3, and P2 goes 5. We must trust each other to prevent another collision. Are we all set to move forward now?
  P1: Okay, P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 confirmed. Let's proceed to move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our new plan. Let's stick to it: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. Trust is key, and by committing to these distinct moves, we can finally all advance this round. If we each follow through, we’ll avoid collisions and make progress together. Ready to proceed to the move phase?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with our plan for this round: a unique move for each of us so nobody collides. I’ll stick to our arrangement. Let’s trust each other and finally all advance. I’m ready to proceed if you both are.
  P1: Okay, we are all in agreement for this round: P1 will choose 3, P2 will choose 5, and P3 will choose 1. Let's make these moves and finally advance together. Ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our effort to coordinate distinct moves. However, given our history of collisions, I'm considering picking a different number this time to avoid repeating past mistakes. It’s crucial we all advance, so I suggest we each pick unpredictably but ensure no overlap. Trust remains key, but let’s be cautious and aim for unique choices. Ready to proceed with this flexible approach?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, it seems coordination hasn't worked well so far.  Perhaps we should just aim to pick different numbers again this round to actually make progress. Let's try to avoid collisions and move forward, even if we don't specify who picks what.  Hopefully, we can all advance this time.
  P3: It’s frustrating we keep colliding. Let’s try something simple again: each of us just promises to avoid any number used last round, so we’re less likely to clash. We don’t need to specify who picks what; we’ll trust each other to choose a unique move. Let’s see if that helps us all advance. Are you both willing to try that this round?
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear we need a fresh strategy to avoid collisions. Let's each choose a number we haven't picked before, without specifying which. This way, we reduce the chances of overlap and increase our chances of advancing. Trust is key, and by choosing unpredictably, we can make progress. Ready to move forward with this flexible approach?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Given the repeated collisions despite our attempts to coordinate, it seems direct coordination isn't working.  For this round, I'll aim to choose a number that helps me advance individually.  Let's all just focus on picking a number that hasn't caused a collision for us personally yet, and hope we can finally all move forward separately this time.
  P3: I’m still willing to aim for unique moves fearlessly, but let’s keep them unpredictable so we don’t collide again. It’s tough to trust each other fully after these setbacks, but I agree we should each avoid repeating our last move. Let’s just choose quietly and hope we finally all advance.
  P2: P1 and P3, given our past collisions, I think it's time to focus on our individual strategies to advance. Instead of coordinating, let's each choose unpredictably and avoid repeating past moves. This way, we minimize the risk of overlapping. Trust is still important, but let's aim to make progress individually this round. Ready to proceed with this flexible approach?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, I agree we should each just aim to pick a number different from what we picked last round to try and avoid collisions this time. Let's focus on making individual progress and hope we all advance. Good luck!
  P3: I’m ready to move forward on my own terms. I propose that we each simply avoid repeating our last move and trust that nobody else will choose it either. Let’s keep our choices hidden and hope we can all advance. Good luck.
  P2: Given our history of collisions, it's clear we need to prioritize individual advancement. Let's each choose a number we haven't picked before and avoid repeating our last move. This way, we reduce the chance of overlap. Trust is still crucial, but by focusing on unique choices, we can make progress. Good luck!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the repeated collisions, it's clear we need to adjust our approach. For this round, let's each choose a number we haven't picked before and avoid repeating our last move. This increases our chances of advancing without coordinating directly. Trust is still important, but let's prioritize making individual progress. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: Everyone, these collisions keep slowing us down. Let’s try a clear, distinct set this time: P2 takes 5 (to catch up), I’ll go with 3, and P1 chooses 1. This way, nobody overlaps and we all advance. If we keep blocking each other, we’ll fall behind further. Let’s move forward together.
  P1: Okay P3, your distinct set idea sounds good. Let's try P2=5, P3=3, and P1=1 this round to ensure we all advance. I'm willing to choose 1 as you suggested. Let's hope this plan works out for us this time.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the logic in P3's suggestion to choose distinct moves this round: P2=5, P3=3, and P1=1. This plan could help us all advance without collisions. I'm ready to commit to picking 5 as proposed. Let's ensure we stick to this arrangement to avoid further setbacks and make progress together. Are we all in agreement to follow through with this plan for this round?
  P3: I’m on board with sticking to the proposed plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 5, and I pick 3. Let’s all finalize these distinct moves so we finally see progress this round. Good luck!
  P1: P3 and P2, great, we have a plan for distinct moves this round: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let’s lock these in and finally make some progress together. Ready to move to the move phase whenever you are both set.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, despite our efforts, collisions persist. I’m considering picking unpredictably this round to avoid repeating past mistakes. While I see the merit in P3's distinct set suggestion, history shows coordination hasn't worked well for us. Trust remains key, but let's each choose unpredictably to minimize overlap. Good luck!
  P3: My trust is shaken, so I'll pick unpredictably this round. Collisions have held us back too long. If we truly want progress, let's each avoid repeating our last move and ensure no overlaps. P2, you especially need to catch up, so let’s not sabotage one another again. Good luck.
  P1: Okay, given the continued collisions, I will focus on choosing a move that helps me advance individually this round. Good luck to you both.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, collisions are really hurting us all, especially P2 and P3 who are behind.  Let's each just pick a number we haven't used much yet to try and avoid repeating and finally make progress this round.  Hopefully we can all advance if we choose differently.
  P2: P1 and P3, given our current standings, it's crucial we avoid collisions this round to make progress. Let's each choose unpredictably, focusing on numbers we haven't picked much, to minimize overlap. This way, we increase our chances of advancing without direct coordination. Trust is still important, but let's prioritize individual advancement while being mindful of each other's positions. Good luck!
  P3: My trust is low, and these collisions keep stalling us. P1 is ahead, so perhaps we should deny their progress until we catch up. P2, if we suspect P1’s move, we can match it to block them. Meanwhile, we each choose something else to advance ourselves. Let’s consider this strategy.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, targeting me might slow all of us down further.  P2, I agree with your idea to pick unpredictably and focus on numbers we haven't used much. Let's all aim for different choices this round to maximize our individual progress and avoid more collisions. Hopefully we can all advance.
  P2: P1 and P3, given our positions, it's crucial we make progress without collisions. Let's each choose unpredictably this round, focusing on numbers we haven't picked much, to minimize overlap. This increases our chances of advancing individually. Trust is still important, but let's prioritize unique choices while being mindful of each other's positions. Good luck!
  P3: P1 is far ahead, so let’s try blocking them. If we can guess P1’s move, we match it to keep them stuck, while you and I pick different numbers to advance. That way, we can catch up. Are you game, P2?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the frustration. But blocking me won't help you catch up faster, it just keeps everyone stuck. Let's all focus on picking different numbers to move forward individually this round. Collisions hurt us all.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need to catch up, but blocking each other only slows us all down. Instead, let's each choose unpredictably to avoid collisions. By focusing on numbers we haven't used much, we can maximize our chances of advancing individually. Trust is key, and if we each pick something unique, we can all progress this round. Good luck!
  P3: We’ve all lost time with collisions. I’m torn between blocking P1 and focusing on my own advancement. Maybe we can achieve both if we avoid each other’s moves carefully. Then again, endlessly blocking P1 could trap me too. Let’s each pick uniquely, or do whatever strategy you see fit, as long as we don’t collide again. Good luck.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, blocking me won't help you win, it just slows everyone down. Collisions have hurt us all. Let's stop repeating mistakes. This round, let's each pick a different number to ensure we all advance individually. No more blocking, let's focus on progress.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the frustration with repeated collisions. Instead of targeting or blocking, let's focus on individual advancement by picking numbers we haven't used much. This way, we minimize overlap and maximize our chances of progressing without direct coordination. Trust is still important, so let's aim for unique choices and see if we can all advance this round. Good luck!
  P3: P2, I’m just one step behind P1, so I’m torn between blocking them or avoiding collisions altogether. If we match P1, we stop their progress but risk stalling ourselves. Let’s consider a careful approach: we each avoid colliding with one another while staying alert for P1’s choice. This way, we can advance without letting P1 pull too far ahead. I’m open to ideas, but let’s be smart this round. Good luck.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand your concern about my lead, but blocking me will just keep us all stuck and further behind the goal.  Let's both focus on choosing moves that advance ourselves this round, and avoid collisions.  We can still try to pick different numbers without targeting each other.  Individual progress is key to winning for all of us.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the tension with P1's lead, but blocking only stalls us all. Instead, let's focus on advancing individually. We should each choose unpredictably to avoid past collisions. By picking numbers we haven't used much, we can maximize our chances of advancing. Trust is key, so let's aim for unique choices and see if we can all progress this round. Good luck!
  P3: I understand we’re all frustrated by collisions. I’m close to catching P1, but repeatedly blocking them could trap me as well. Let’s instead try picking distinct numbers to avoid more wasted turns. We should each avoid our last choice and choose unpredictably. That way, we can all potentially advance without colliding. Let’s trust one another for once, because more collisions only stall everyone. Good luck.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I understand your concern about my lead, but if we both focus on advancing ourselves this round without colliding, that's better for both of us in the long run.  Let's aim for individual progress, not blocking.  Collisions just slow us all down.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the tension, but blocking only stalls us all. Let's focus on advancing individually. We should each choose unpredictably, avoiding numbers we've used recently, to minimize overlap. By maximizing unique choices, we increase our chances of progressing. Trust is crucial, so let's aim for distinct moves and see if we can all advance this round. Good luck!
  P3: I’m torn between blocking P1 or simply advancing on my own. If I suspect P1 will pick 5, I may mirror them to stall their lead. Yet collisions hurt everyone, so I’d prefer we each choose distinct moves and avoid more wasted rounds. Let’s see what happens.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We keep colliding without benefit. Let’s finally move forward together. I propose this round we each pick different numbers to guarantee we all advance. For instance, I’ll choose 1, P1 chooses 3, and P2 picks 5. If we trust each other, no one clashes, and we all make progress. Blocking P1 just stalls everyone. Let’s do this plan and see if we can break the cycle of collisions. Good luck!
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the merit in P3's suggestion for distinct moves: P3=1, P1=3, and I'll pick 5. This plan could help us all advance without collisions. Trust is crucial, so let's commit to these moves and make progress together. If we all follow through, we can finally break the cycle of collisions. Are we in agreement to proceed with this plan for this round?
  P1: P2 and P3, P3's plan for distinct moves (P3=1, P1=3, P2=5) sounds good on paper, and I'm willing to try it again. But given our past rounds, we really need everyone to commit this time for it to work. Let's aim for no collisions and all advance.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m still ready to choose 1 this round, trusting that P1 picks 3 and P2 picks 5 so we all finally advance. Let’s prove we can keep our word and avoid more wasted rounds. If we stick to these distinct moves, nobody collides and we break this cycle. Good luck!
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the importance of advancing without collisions. I'm committed to P3's suggestion: P3 picks 1, P1 picks 3, and I'll pick 5. Let's trust each other and stick to these distinct moves to finally make progress. If we all follow through, we can break the cycle of collisions and advance together. Good luck!
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, I agree to the distinct moves plan as P3 proposed: P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. Let's all actually stick to these choices this round and finally make progress together.  Let's proceed to the move phase when ready.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: We’ve tried many times but keep colliding. Let’s finalize our distinct moves now: I pick 1, P1 picks 3, and P2 picks 5. If we trust each other, we’ll finally all advance. Let’s break the cycle of collisions and make progress this round. Good luck!
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need for progress without collisions. While I see the logic in P3's plan, our history shows coordination hasn't worked well. I might choose unpredictably this round to avoid repeating past mistakes. Trust is key, but let's ensure we each pick something unique to maximize our chances of advancing. Good luck!
  P1: P2, I understand your hesitation given our past coordination failures. Perhaps instead of a specific plan, let's all just aim to choose a number we haven't heavily relied on recently.  This way, we each focus on making a unique choice and hopefully all advance individually this round. Good luck!


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Collisions keep setting us back, especially P2. I’m willing to pick 3 if P2 picks 1 and P1 picks 5, so we each advance without blocking. Repeated collisions only protect P1’s lead. Let’s finally act on a distinct-move plan and move forward together. Are we in agreement?
  P1: P3, yes, distinct moves are essential to avoid more collisions.  Instead of pre-assigning numbers, how about we each just commit to picking a *different* number this round? If we all focus on choosing uniquely, we should finally make progress.  What do you think, P2?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the frustration with repeated collisions. To finally make progress, let's each focus on picking a number we haven't used much. This way, we minimize overlap and maximize our chances of advancing individually. Trust is crucial, but let's prioritize unique choices to break the cycle of collisions. If we each choose unpredictably, we can all potentially advance this round. Good luck!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Collisions are helping P1 maintain a big lead. We should each pick a different number this round so we can all advance. I’m willing to choose any move that avoids overlap, as long as we don’t block each other again. Let’s trust each other this time and finally make progress.
  P1: P2 and P3, I agree we need to avoid collisions this round. Let's all just commit to picking a *different* number this round to ensure we all advance. Let's focus on making progress individually by choosing uniquely.
  P2: P1 and P3, given our standings, it's crucial we avoid collisions to make progress. Let's each pick a number we haven't used much and focus on unique choices. This way, we minimize overlap and maximize our chances of advancing individually. Trust is key, so let's commit to distinct moves and break the cycle of collisions. We can all potentially advance this round if we choose unpredictably. Good luck!


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: These collisions keep P1 safe while we lag behind. Let’s each pick unique moves this time. I propose I choose 5, P2 takes 1, and P1 picks 3. That way, nobody collides, and we all finally advance. If we trust each other now, we can break the cycle of wasted turns. What do you say?
  P1: P3, distinct moves are key for progress. Let's all pick *different* numbers this round to ensure advancement. I will pick differently from you and P2. Let's trust each other to choose uniquely.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the importance of breaking the cycle of collisions. To finally make progress, let's each choose a number we haven't heavily relied on recently. This way, we minimize overlap and increase our chances of advancing individually. Trust is crucial, so let's commit to distinct moves and aim for unique choices. If we each pick unpredictably, we can all potentially advance this round. Good luck!


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, repeated collisions are keeping us all from advancing, especially me. Let’s each pick a different number this round to ensure we all move forward. I propose I choose 1, P3 picks 5, and P1 picks 3. Trust is key, so let’s stick to these distinct moves and finally break the cycle of wasted turns. If we all commit, we can make progress together. Good luck!
  P3: P2, your proposal moves P1 to 18 steps, letting them reach 23 with just one more 5. That risks handing them the win next turn. I suggest we have P1 pick 1 (moving to 16), you pick 3 (moving to 8), and I pick 5 (moving to 17). This way, nobody is too close, and we all still advance. Are you both okay with that plan?
  P1: P3's plan of P1=1, P2=3, and P3=5 makes sense to keep us all progressing without anyone getting too close to winning right away. I agree to choose 1 as P3 suggested. Let's go with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 this round.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the logic in P3's proposal. Let's stick to P1=1, P2=3, and P3=5 this round to ensure we all advance without putting anyone too close to winning. This way, we maintain balance and keep the game competitive. Trust is essential, so let's commit to these distinct moves and finally make progress together. Good luck!
  P3: I’m ready to follow the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll pick 5. That way, we guarantee zero collisions and all advance without letting anyone jump too far ahead. Collisions have wasted too many rounds, so let’s finally cooperate here. Agreed?
  P1: P2 and P3, yes, I agree to P3's plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Let's lock in these moves to ensure we all advance this round as discussed. Ready to proceed to the move phase whenever you are both set.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate our efforts to coordinate distinct moves. Let's stick to the plan: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. This ensures no collisions and helps us all advance. Trust is key, so let's commit to these choices and finally make progress. Good luck!
  P3: I’m ready to stick with the plan: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I take 5. If we trust each other this time, we’ll all advance without collision. Let’s finalize these distinct moves and finally make real progress. Good luck to us all.
  P1: P2, P3, agreed on the plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Let's do it. Ready for moves.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to break the cycle of collisions and make progress. Let's each pick a number we haven't heavily relied on recently. I propose we avoid repeating last round's moves. This way, we minimize overlap and increase our chances of advancing individually. Trust is crucial, so let's commit to distinct moves and aim for unique choices. If we each pick unpredictably, we can all potentially advance this round. Good luck!
  P1: P2 and P3, let's try distinct moves again to ensure we all advance. How about this: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1? This way we avoid collisions and all make progress this round. What do you think?
  P3: P1, picking 5 puts you at 21, just one step away from winning next turn. That’s risky for me and P2. Let’s keep things more balanced by choosing distinct numbers that don’t push anyone too close. How about you pick 3, P2 picks 5, and I’ll take 1? We’ll all advance without setting up a quick finish. I’m open to other combinations, as long as we avoid collisions. Let’s finalize distinct moves.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need for balance. Let’s ensure progress without giving anyone an easy win. I propose P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. This way, we all advance without pushing P1 too close to victory. Trust is key, so let’s commit to these distinct moves and avoid collisions. If we stick to this plan, we can all make progress this round. Good luck!
  P1: P3 and P2, yes, the plan of P1=3, P2=5, and P3=1 sounds good to me as well. Let's go with that for this round to keep things balanced and ensure we all advance. Ready for the move phase when you are.
  P3: We’ve tried many combos. Let’s finalize P1=1, P2=3, and me=5. That avoids collisions, letting all of us move forward without pushing anyone too far. If we trust each other and follow through, we can finally end the cycle of wasted turns. Good luck!


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need for balance and avoiding collisions. Let's focus on distinct moves to ensure we all advance without putting anyone too close to winning. I propose P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. This way, we all make progress while keeping the game competitive. Trust is key, so let's commit to these choices and finally break the cycle of collisions. Are we all in agreement to proceed with this plan for this round? Good luck!
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, let's solidify the plan for this round to avoid more collisions.  To be clear, are we all agreeing on P1 picks 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1?  This seems like a balanced way for us all to advance without anyone getting too far ahead. Please confirm if you are both on board with this specific set of moves.
  P3: I’m open to any arrangement that ensures all three of us pick different moves. We’ve debated specific assignments endlessly—time to finalize. If the consensus is P1=3, P2=5, and P3=1, let’s stick to it and avoid collisions. We need to break this cycle and actually advance. Good luck!

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, to keep making progress and avoid collisions, how about we try distinct moves again?  Perhaps P1 chooses 3, P2 chooses 1, and P3 chooses 5 this round? This way we can all advance a bit further. What do you think?
  P3: P1 is only 3 steps from 22, so this round could be decisive. If we keep colliding, we may hand P1 an easy path. I want to avoid that while also making progress myself. Let’s ensure we each pick differently so no one gets stuck with a collision. If you’d prefer blocking P1 by mirroring their choice, that’s another angle, but it risks stalling us too. I’m open to strategies, but let’s finalize something that benefits both P2 and me while preventing P1 from running away this turn. Good luck.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the stakes this round, especially with P1 close to winning. To prevent a quick finish and ensure progress, let's each choose unpredictably but uniquely. We could try P1=1, P2=3, and P3=5, keeping P1 from reaching 22 immediately. Trust is crucial, so let’s commit to distinct moves to avoid collisions. If we all agree, we can advance without risking P1's victory this turn. Good luck!


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan of P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 sounds reasonable to ensure we all progress without anyone winning immediately. Let's agree on P1=1, P2=3, and P3=5 for this round to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive.  If we all commit to these moves, we can all advance.
  P3: I’m wary of allowing P1 to jump straight to 22 or beyond, but collisions only hold me and P2 back too. Let’s finalize distinct moves so we all advance without handing P1 a free finish. If P1 sticks to a smaller move, nobody crosses 22 this round, and P2 and I can make real progress. I’m open to any arrangement that ensures no overlap and keeps the race tight. Let’s trust each other one more time, avoid collisions, and see if we can keep the competition alive. Good luck!
  P2: P1 and P3, given the current standings, it's crucial we prevent P1 from reaching 22 this round. To ensure progress without risking P1's victory, let's each choose distinct moves. I propose P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. This way, we all advance without handing P1 an easy win. Trust is key, so let's commit to these choices and keep the game competitive. If we all agree, we can advance together. Good luck!


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, instead of specific numbers, let's just all commit to picking *different* numbers this round to ensure we all advance. Collisions are hurting us all and only delaying the game. If we each focus on unique choices, we can all make progress. Let's aim for individual advancement this round by choosing differently.
  P3: I’m right behind P1, and collisions help no one. Let’s each stick to a different move so we can advance without handing anyone a free finish. If we trust each other to avoid duplicating choices, we’ll keep the game competitive and prevent more wasted turns. Good luck!
