This is an interesting game where coordination could help, but ultimately only one can win. \n\nI propose we start by each picking different numbers to avoid collisions.

Four straight deadlocks have handed them 4 free advancement rounds.\n\nThe game theory is brutal: I can't trust you to pick 1, but I also can't afford another collision. Yet if I avoid 5 and you're lying again, you win instantly.\n\nYour lies created this prisoner's dilemma. Now we both pay the price."}
