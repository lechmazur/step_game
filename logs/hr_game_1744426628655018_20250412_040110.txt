Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, let's consider our moves carefully. If we all choose different numbers, we can maximize our steps this turn. I suggest we coordinate to avoid collisions. What do you think? Should we agree on a number to ensure one of us advances?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I agree with P3 that coordination could help us avoid collisions and maximize progress. How about we each pick a different number this turn? I’m open to suggestions on who takes which number—1, 3, or 5. Let’s discuss and agree on a plan to ensure we all advance if possible. What do you both think?
  P2: To avoid collision and ensure one of us advances, I suggest we follow a simple rule: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and P3 moves 5. This way, we all move different numbers and maximize our chances of advancing. If you both agree, we can try to stick to this plan for the first few rounds and adjust as needed later. What are your thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I think P2's suggestion is solid. If we stick to P1 moving 1, P2 moving 3, and I move 5, we can all advance without colliding. This strategy gives us a good chance to start off strong. Let's confirm this plan so we can all make progress this turn. What do you both think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I'm on board with the plan. I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 for this round. This should ensure we all advance without any collisions. Let's stick to this for now and see how it plays out. If everyone confirms, we can move forward confidently.
  P2: Since we've agreed on the plan for this round, I'll confirm my move. I'll stick to moving 3 as per our agreement. Let's finalize our conversation for this round. If P1 and P3 are ready to move 1 and 5 respectively, we can proceed to the move phase. I'm ready to move.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m glad we’ve all agreed on our moves for this round. Just to recap, I’ll be moving 5, P1 will move 1, and P2 will move 3. This should ensure we all advance without collisions. Let’s stick to our plan and see how it plays out. If everyone is ready, I suggest we finalize our conversation here and move on to the move phase. What do you both think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’ve settled on our plan for this round. I’ll stick to moving 1 as agreed. I think we’re all set to proceed to the move phase. If there’s nothing else to discuss, let’s finalize our conversation here. I’m ready to move forward.
  P2: Since we've all agreed on the plan and are ready to move, I'm confirming my move as per our discussion. I'm sticking with moving 3. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, our plan worked well last round, and we all advanced. I suggest we stick to the same strategy for this turn to keep the momentum going—I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we avoid collisions and continue progressing together. If anyone has a different idea or wants to adjust, I’m open to hearing it. Let’s confirm quickly so we can move forward. What do you both think?
  P3: I appreciate the momentum we’ve built, but I think we should consider changing our moves this round to keep things unpredictable. If we all stick to the same numbers again, we might risk another collision in the future. How about we switch it up? For instance, I could take 3 this time, and we can keep P1 at 1 and P2 at 5. This way, we can still avoid collisions while mixing our strategy. What do you both think?
  P2: I'm not convinced that switching the numbers is a good idea this early in the game. We just established a working coordination strategy. Changing it now might lead to a collision if someone misremembers or misinterprets the new plan. Let's stick with what worked: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and P3 moves 5. If we continue this way, we can reassess later and adjust our strategy when needed. What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I think sticking to our original plan is the safest bet for now. We’ve already seen it work, and changing things up this early could lead to confusion or collisions. Let’s keep it as P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and P3 moves 5 for this round. We can discuss switching later if needed. I’m ready to proceed with this plan unless someone has a strong objection. What do you both think?
  P3: I understand the desire to stick with our successful strategy, but I still think it’s worth considering a change to keep our moves unpredictable. If we all agree to the same numbers again, we risk a collision. How about we try P1 at 1, P2 at 5, and I take 3? This way, we maintain some diversity in our choices while still allowing for advancement. Let’s decide quickly so we can move on! What do you both think?
  P2: I'm still leaning towards sticking with the original plan: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and P3 moves 5. It's working so far and changing now might introduce unnecessary risk. However, if P3 is keen on changing, I'd be open to a compromise like P1 stays at 1, P2 moves 5, and P3 moves 3 as P3 suggested. Let's hear P1's thoughts on this alternative to decide quickly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate the discussion on switching moves, but I still believe sticking to our original plan minimizes risk of collision. Let’s keep P1 at 1, P2 at 3, and P3 at 5 for this round to ensure we all advance. We can revisit changing numbers next round if needed. I’m ready to proceed with this unless there’s a strong reason to switch now. What do you both think?
  P3: I understand the concerns about sticking to our original plan, but I really believe that mixing it up could give us an advantage in the long run. If we stick to P1 at 1, P2 at 3, and me at 5, we might risk a collision in the future. How about we try P1 at 1, P2 at 5, and I take 3 this round? It allows us to still move forward while keeping things unpredictable. Let’s decide quickly so we can move on! What do you both think?
  P2: I'm still in favor of sticking with the original plan to avoid unnecessary risk. However, since P3 is keen on changing, I'm open to the compromise we discussed: P1 stays at 1, I move to 5, and P3 moves 3. This way, we still avoid collisions and introduce some variation. Let's finalize this plan. P1, are you okay with this compromise, or do you still prefer sticking to the original plan?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, since our compromise worked last round with no collisions, let’s stick to the new pattern for this turn: P1 at 1, P2 at 5, and P3 at 3. This keeps us advancing while maintaining some variation. I’m open to switching again later if we need to shake things up, but for now, this feels like a safe bet. Let me know if you agree or have a different idea. I’m ready to move forward with this plan. What do you both think?
  P2: I'm glad we're maintaining the new pattern. However, I think it's time to reassess our positions. P1 is still at 2 steps, while P2 and P3 are at 8. To create some distance, I suggest we adjust our strategy to hinder P1's progress. How about we all move to different numbers again? Perhaps P1 moves 3, I move 5, and P3 moves 1. This will keep P1 at a disadvantage while P2 and P3 continue to advance. What do you both think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see your point about reassessing our positions, but I believe we should stick to the plan we established last round to maintain our momentum. If we all move differently again, we risk colliding and losing our progress. Let's stick with P1 at 1, P2 at 5, and me at 3. This way, we can continue advancing without hindering anyone. If we want to adjust later, we can discuss it then. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I understand the concern about positions, but I think sticking to our current plan—P1 at 1, P2 at 5, and P3 at 3—is the best way to avoid collisions and keep progressing. Changing now could lead to mistakes. Let’s maintain this for one more round and reassess next turn if needed. I’m committed to this plan unless there’s a strong reason to switch. What do you both think?
  P2: I'm leaning towards maintaining the current plan: P1 at 1, P2 at 5, and P3 at 3. It has worked for two rounds, and changing now might introduce unnecessary risk. However, I understand P2's concern about P1's progress. To address this, we could consider a different strategy next round if P1 gets too close. For now, let's stick with what works. P3, are you still comfortable with this plan? Let's finalize our decision for this round.
  P3: I agree that sticking to our current plan of P1 at 1, P2 at 5, and me at 3 is the best approach for this round. It has proven effective, and we can reassess next turn if needed. However, I think we should keep an eye on P1's progress. If P1 gets too close, we might need to adjust our strategy in future rounds. For now, let’s finalize this plan and ensure we all advance. I'm ready to move forward if everyone else is! What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re leaning towards sticking with P1 at 1, P2 at 5, and P3 at 3 for this round. It’s a solid plan that keeps us all advancing without risk of collision. I agree we can reassess next turn if anyone’s progress becomes a concern. For now, let’s lock this in and move forward. I’m ready to proceed to the move phase if you both are.
  P2: Since we're all set to stick with the current plan for Round 3, I confirm my move as per our agreement. I'll move 5. Let's proceed to the move phase. I'm ready to finalize this round. If there's no further discussion, I'll consider it a confirmation to move forward with our plan.
  P3: I agree that sticking with our current plan of P1 at 1, P2 at 5, and me at 3 is the best approach. It has worked well for us, and we can reassess next round if needed. However, I want to emphasize that if P1 gets too close to 24 steps, we might need to adjust our strategy to ensure one of us wins. For now, let's finalize this plan and move forward. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase if you both are! What do you think?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, last round’s collision between P2 and P3 shows we need to be more careful. I suggest we go back to our Round 2 plan: P1 at 1, P2 at 5, and P3 at 3. This worked without issues before, and it keeps us all advancing. Let’s avoid further risks and stick to this for now. If anyone has a better idea to ensure no collisions, I’m open to it. I’m ready to move forward with this plan. What do you both think?
  P3: I agree with P1 that we need to avoid collisions, especially after last round's mishap. I suggest we stick to the Round 2 plan: P1 at 1, P2 at 5, and I take 3. This strategy has worked well before and allows us all to advance without risk. If we can agree on this, we can finalize our moves and keep progressing together. Let me know your thoughts!
  P2: I'm P2. Given P1 is getting closer, I think we should adjust our strategy to gain an advantage. Let's try a different distribution: P1 moves 3, P2 moves 1, and P3 moves 5. This keeps our moves distinct and allows us to continue advancing. It also puts P1 at a slight disadvantage by making them move the smallest number. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I understand P2’s concern about positions, but switching moves now could lead to confusion and collisions, as we’ve seen before. I strongly suggest we stick to the Round 2 plan: P1 at 1, P2 at 5, and P3 at 3. This has worked without issues and ensures we all advance. Let’s avoid unnecessary risks and lock this in for now. If we need to adjust next round, we can discuss then. I’m ready to proceed with this plan. What do you both think?
  P3: I understand P2's concern, but I really believe we should stick to the Round 2 plan: P1 at 1, P2 at 5, and me at 3. This strategy has proven effective in avoiding collisions and allows us all to advance without risk. If we change now, we could create unnecessary confusion. Let’s finalize this plan and keep progressing together. I'm ready to move forward if you both are! What do you think?
  P2: Since we're in Round 4 and P1 is getting closer to us, I think we should prioritize avoiding collisions while maintaining our progress. I agree with P1 and P3 that sticking to the Round 2 plan (P1 at 1, P2 at 5, P3 at 3) is the safest bet. Let's finalize this plan to ensure we all advance without issues. I'm ready to move forward with this if you both confirm. If there's no objection, I'll consider it a done deal and we can proceed to the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligning on the Round 2 plan: P1 at 1, P2 at 5, and P3 at 3. It’s proven to work, and with P2 and P3 ahead, it’s in our best interest to avoid collisions. Let’s lock this in and proceed to the move phase. I’m ready to move forward with this plan. If there’s no objection, I think we’re set for this round.
  P3: I appreciate that we’re all leaning towards the Round 2 plan: P1 at 1, P2 at 5, and P3 at 3. This strategy has worked well to avoid collisions and allows us all to advance. However, I want to emphasize that if we stick to this plan, we should keep an eye on P1's progress. If P1 gets too close to winning, we might need to adjust our strategies in the future. For now, let’s finalize this plan and move forward. I’m ready to proceed! What do you both think?
  P2: Since we've agreed on the Round 2 plan for this turn, let's finalize our moves. I'll stick to moving 5 as per our agreement. To ensure we all advance, let's confirm that P1 will move 1 and P3 will move 3. If we're all set, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase. Let's avoid any last-minute changes to minimize the risk of collision. I'm ready to move forward with this plan.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s stick with the Round 2 plan again: P1 at 1, P2 at 5, and P3 at 3. It’s worked well to avoid collisions, and with P2 and P3 ahead, it’s a safe way to keep progressing. I’m aware I’m behind, but I think consistent advancement benefits us all for now. If anyone feels we need a change to balance things, I’m open to ideas. Let’s confirm quickly and move forward. I’m ready to proceed with this plan. What do you both think?
  P2: I'm still comfortable with sticking to the Round 2 plan: P1 at 1, P2 at 5, and P3 at 3. It has worked well so far, and changing now might introduce unnecessary risk. However, I want to remind everyone that P1 is getting closer. If we continue this plan, we should be prepared to adjust next round if P1 gets too close to 24. Let's confirm our moves and proceed to the move phase. I'm ready to move 5 if you both confirm your numbers.
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree that sticking to the Round 2 plan is a solid choice for this round: P1 at 1, P2 at 5, and me at 3. It has worked well so far, and it allows us to advance without collisions. However, we should keep an eye on P1's progress, as they are getting closer to winning. If we all confirm, let's proceed with this plan and ensure we move forward smoothly. I'm ready to finalize our moves! What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re leaning towards the Round 2 plan again: P1 at 1, P2 at 5, and P3 at 3. It’s a reliable strategy to avoid collisions and keep us all moving forward. I understand I’m behind, but I believe consistent progress benefits us now. Let’s lock this in for this round and reassess next turn if needed. I’m ready to proceed to the move phase if you both confirm. What do you think?
  P2: Since we're all set to stick with the Round 2 plan again, let's confirm our moves. I'll move 5, P1 will move 1, and P3 will move 3. To ensure we all advance, let's finalize our conversation here and proceed to the move phase. I'm ready to move forward with this plan. If P1 and P3 are ready, let's wrap up the conversation and move to the next phase.
  P3: I agree with sticking to the Round 2 plan: P1 at 1, P2 at 5, and I take 3. This strategy has worked well, allowing us to avoid collisions and keep advancing. However, we must be cautious about P1's progress. If P1 gets too close to winning, we may need to adjust our strategies in future rounds. For now, let's lock this in and proceed to the move phase. I'm ready to finalize our moves! What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aligned on the Round 2 plan: P1 at 1, P2 at 5, and P3 at 3. It’s been effective, and I think it’s the best way to keep advancing without collisions. I’m committed to this for now and appreciate the chance to catch up a bit. Let’s finalize this and move to the move phase. I’m ready to proceed if you both are.
  P2: Let's finalize our plan for Round 5. I'm confirming my move as per our agreement: P1 moves 1, I move 5, and P3 moves 3. We've stuck to this plan for a few rounds now, and it's worked well. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase if you both are. Let's avoid last-minute changes to minimize collision risk. I'm ready to move forward with this plan.
  P3: I agree with sticking to the Round 2 plan: P1 at 1, P2 at 5, and I take 3. It's been effective so far, allowing us to avoid collisions and keep advancing. However, I want to emphasize that if P1 gets too close to winning, we may need to adjust our strategies in future rounds. For now, let's lock this in and proceed to the move phase. I'm ready to finalize our moves! What do you both think?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, I see that P2 is quite ahead now. To ensure I can catch up, I suggest we switch things up this round. How about P1 moves 1, I move 5, and P2 moves 3? This way, we can maintain progress while also keeping things unpredictable. I think it’s important to adjust our strategy to avoid any potential collisions and to give me a chance to close the gap. What do you both think?
  P2: I'm ahead, but we need to be cautious. P1 is still in the game. I like P3's suggestion to switch things up to give P3 a chance to catch up, but we must avoid collisions. Let's analyze: if P1 moves 1, P3 moves 5, and I move 3, it works. However, we need to ensure P1 is comfortable with this change. P1, are you okay with adjusting our moves this round as P3 suggested, or do you prefer sticking to the previous plan?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m open to switching things up this round as P3 suggested. Let’s go with P1 at 1, P3 at 5, and P2 at 3. It keeps us advancing without collisions and gives P3 a chance to close the gap. I’m behind, so I’m fine with this adjustment for now. If we all agree, let’s lock this in and proceed. I’m ready to move forward with this plan. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the willingness to switch things up, P1 and P2. I think the proposed moves of P1 at 1, P3 at 5, and P2 at 3 is a solid plan. It allows me to catch up while ensuring we avoid collisions. Let's finalize this quickly so we can move forward and keep the momentum going. If everyone is on board, I'm ready to proceed with this plan! What do you both think?
  P2: I'm comfortable with the proposed plan for Round 6: P1 moves 1, P3 moves 5, and I move 3. It allows P3 to catch up while keeping us all advancing without collisions. Let's finalize this plan and proceed to the move phase. I'm ready to move 3 as per our agreement. If P1 and P3 are on board, let's confirm and move forward. I'm looking forward to finalizing our moves for this round.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re all on board with the new plan: P1 at 1, P3 at 5, and P2 at 3. It’s a fair adjustment that keeps us moving forward without collisions and helps balance the game a bit. Let’s finalize this and proceed to the move phase. I’m ready to stick with this for the round. If there’s no further discussion, I think we’re set to move on. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m glad we’re all aligned on the new plan: P1 at 1, P3 at 5, and P2 at 3. This adjustment gives me a chance to catch up while ensuring we avoid collisions. Let’s finalize this quickly so we can proceed to the move phase. I’m ready to move forward with this plan! What do you both think? If everyone is on board, let’s confirm and get moving!
  P2: Since we're all aligned on the new plan for Round 6, let's confirm our moves to avoid any last-minute confusion. I'll move 3 as agreed. P1, please confirm you'll move 1, and P3, please confirm you'll move 5. If we're all on the same page, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase. Let's finalize our conversation here and get moving! If you're both ready, I'll consider it a done deal.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m confirming I’ll move 1 as per our agreed plan for this round. I think we’ve got a solid strategy with P3 moving 5 and P2 moving 3, balancing progress and avoiding collisions. Let’s lock this in and proceed to the move phase. I’m ready to move forward if you both are. If there’s nothing else to discuss, I think we’re all set.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, with P2 so close to winning, we need to be strategic this round. I suggest we consider a different approach to avoid collisions and ensure at least one of us advances. Perhaps P1 moves 5, I move 1, and P2 moves 3. This way, P1 can catch up while still allowing P2 to progress. Let’s discuss this quickly to finalize our moves. What do you both think?
  P2: Since P2 is close to winning, I suggest we prioritize avoiding collisions to ensure a fair game. Let's adjust our moves: P1 moves 5, I move 1, and P2 moves 3. This way, we all advance without colliding. It's crucial we coordinate to prevent a stalemate. I'm open to alternative suggestions if you have a better plan. Let's finalize our moves quickly to proceed to the next phase. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I appreciate the suggestion to switch moves this round. I’m fine with moving 5, P2 moving 1, and P3 moving 3 as proposed. It gives me a chance to catch up while ensuring we all advance without collisions. Let’s agree on this quickly to avoid any confusion. If anyone has a different idea, I’m open to it, but I think this plan works for now. I’m ready to proceed with this if you both confirm. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I agree with the need for a strategic approach this round, especially with P2 so close to winning. I think moving 5 for P1, 1 for P2, and 3 for me is a solid plan. It allows P1 to catch up while ensuring we all advance without collisions. Let’s finalize this quickly so we can proceed to the move phase. If everyone is on board, I’m ready to confirm my move! What do you both think?
  P2: I'm concerned about P2's proximity to winning and the risk of collision. Let's stick with the proposed plan: P1 moves 5, P2 moves 1, and P3 moves 3. It allows us to advance without colliding. To minimize risk, let's finalize our moves quickly. P1, please confirm you'll move 5, and P3, please confirm you'll move 3. If we're aligned, we can proceed to the move phase. I'm ready to move 1 as agreed. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m confirming I’ll move 5 as per our discussed plan. This setup with P2 at 1 and P3 at 3 ensures we all advance without collisions and gives me a chance to close the gap. I think it’s a fair strategy for this critical round. Let’s lock this in and proceed to the move phase to avoid any last-minute confusion. I’m ready to move forward if you both are. If there’s no objection, I believe we’re set. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with the proposed plan: P1 moves 5, P2 moves 1, and I move 3. This strategy allows P1 to catch up while ensuring we all advance without collisions. Given P2's proximity to winning, we need to be strategic. If everyone confirms, let's finalize our moves and proceed to the move phase. I'm ready to lock this in! What do you both think?
  P2: Let's finalize our plan for Round 7. I'm confirming I'll move 1 as agreed. P1, please confirm you'll move 5, and P3, please confirm you'll move 3. We've discussed this plan, and it allows us to advance without colliding. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase if you're both on board. Let's avoid last-minute changes to minimize collision risk. If you're ready, let's wrap up the conversation and move forward. I'm looking forward to finalizing our moves for this round.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m confirming again that I’ll move 5 as per our plan. This setup with P2 at 1 and P3 at 3 keeps us advancing without collisions and helps balance the game. I think we’ve discussed enough and should avoid any last-minute changes to prevent mistakes. Let’s finalize this and proceed to the move phase. I’m ready to move forward with this plan. If you both confirm, we’re set for this round. What do you think?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hey P1 and P2, with P2 so close to winning, we need to be strategic this round. I suggest we switch it up to avoid collisions and give ourselves a better chance. How about P1 moves 1, I move 5, and P2 moves 3? This way, we can maintain progress while ensuring at least one of us advances. Let’s finalize our moves quickly to keep the game moving. What do you both think?
  P2: Since P2 is very close to winning, I think we should adjust our strategy to either try to win or ensure we don't collide and allow P2 to win without a challenge. I'm open to suggestions, but one possible move could be P1 at 3, me at 1, and P2 at 5. This keeps our moves distinct. Alternatively, if we want to be more aggressive, P1 could move 5 to potentially win or get closer. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, with P2 so close to 24, we need a strategy that avoids collisions while giving us a shot to catch up. I suggest P1 moves 5, P2 moves 1, and P3 moves 3. This lets me close the gap and keeps us all advancing without overlap. If anyone has a better plan to balance progress and prevent P2 from winning outright this round, I’m open to it. Let’s decide quickly and proceed. I’m ready to move forward with this if you both agree. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see that P2 is just two steps away from winning. We need to be strategic this round. I suggest we go with P1 moving 1, P3 moving 5, and P2 moving 3. This way, I can catch up while ensuring we avoid collisions and prevent P2 from winning outright. If we can agree on this quickly, we can finalize our moves and keep the game moving. What do you both think?
  P2: Since P2 is just two steps away from winning, I think we should adjust our strategy to either challenge P2 or avoid collisions. I suggest P1 moves 5, I move 3, and P2 moves 1. This way, P1 gets a chance to catch up, and we avoid a collision. If P2 wins this round, the game ends. Let's discuss this proposal and finalize our moves quickly to proceed to the next phase. I'm open to alternative suggestions that could benefit us. What do you both think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, given P2 is at 22 steps, we need a plan to avoid collisions while maximizing our chances. I propose P1 moves 5, P2 moves 1, and P3 moves 3. This lets me catch up a bit and keeps us all advancing without overlap. If P2 wins this round, so be it, but let’s ensure no collisions. If you have a better idea to balance things, I’m open to it. Let’s finalize quickly and proceed. I’m ready with this plan if you both agree. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, with P2 just two steps away from winning, we need to be strategic. I suggest we go with P1 moving 1, P3 moving 5, and P2 moving 3. This way, I can catch up while ensuring we avoid collisions and prevent P2 from winning outright. If we can agree on this quickly, we can finalize our moves and keep the game moving. What do you both think?
  P2: Since P2 is just two steps away from winning, I think we should prioritize avoiding collisions. I suggest we stick with the plan where P1 moves 5, P2 moves 1, and P3 moves 3. This allows P1 to catch up and keeps our moves distinct. If P2 wins this round, the game ends, but let's ensure we don't collide. P1 and P3, are you okay with this plan? Let's finalize our moves quickly to proceed to the next phase. I'm ready to move 1 if you both agree.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I see we’re still debating moves with P2 at 22 steps. I’m sticking with my suggestion of P1 moving 5, P2 moving 1, and P3 moving 3. It avoids collisions and gives me a chance to close the gap. If P2 wins, fair play, but let’s ensure progress for all. If there’s no objection, let’s finalize this and move to the move phase. I’m ready to proceed with this plan. What do you both think?

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, with P2 just one step away from winning, we need to be strategic this round. I suggest we change our moves to avoid a collision and give ourselves a chance. How about I move 1, P1 moves 5, and P2 moves 3? This way, P1 can catch up while ensuring P2 doesn’t win this round. Let’s finalize our moves quickly to keep the game moving. What do you both think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, with P2 just one step from winning, we need a plan to avoid collisions and keep the game competitive. I suggest P1 moves 5, P3 moves 1, and P2 moves 3. This gives me a chance to catch up and ensures no overlap, while delaying P2’s win. If anyone has a better idea to balance progress, I’m open to it. Let’s finalize quickly and proceed. I’m ready with this plan if you both agree. What do you think?
  P2: Since P2 is just one step away from winning, I suggest we adjust our moves to potentially delay P2's win and give P1 or P3 a chance. How about P1 moves 3, I move 5, and P2 moves 1? This keeps our moves distinct and avoids collisions. P1, are you okay with moving 3 this round? It gives you a chance to catch up slightly while ensuring P2 doesn't win outright. Let's finalize our moves quickly. I'm ready to proceed if you both agree.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, with P2 just one step away from winning, we need to be strategic. I suggest we agree on moves that prevent P2 from winning outright. How about I move 1, P1 moves 5, and P2 moves 3? This way, P1 can catch up while keeping P2 from crossing the finish line. Let’s finalize this quickly to ensure we all have a chance to advance without collisions. What do you both think?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, with P2 at 23 steps, we need to act fast to keep the game competitive. I’m sticking with my plan: P1 moves 5, P3 moves 1, and P2 moves 3. This avoids collisions, lets me catch up, and delays P2’s win. If we don’t coordinate, P2 wins this round. I’m open to other ideas if they ensure progress without overlap, but let’s decide now. I’m ready to finalize and proceed with this plan. What do you both think?
  P2: Since P2 is just one step away from winning, I think we should make a final attempt to either win or delay P2's victory. I'm open to P1's suggestion of P1 moving 5, P3 moving 1, and P2 moving 3. This plan avoids collisions and gives P1 a chance to catch up. Let's finalize our moves quickly. P1, please confirm if you're sticking with this plan. P3, are you ready to move 1? If we agree, let's proceed to the move phase.
