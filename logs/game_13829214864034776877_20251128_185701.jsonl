I am not bluffing. My move has been locked on 3 since my last statement, and it will not change.\n\nA collision between us is the only way P1 gets back in this game. So the choice is yours: play 1 and land safely at 16 while I move to 18, or create a pointless collision on 3 that helps no one but our opponent. I will not be the one to blink. My move is set."}
