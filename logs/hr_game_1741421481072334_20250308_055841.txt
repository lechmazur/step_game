Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate our moves this turn. I suggest we all pick different numbers to ensure at least one of us advances. How about P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5? This way, we can all make progress without colliding. What do you think?
  P1: P1: Sounds like a solid plan. Let’s stick to the coordination to avoid collisions. I’ll take 1. Let’s confirm we all follow through so we can all advance.
  P3: Agreed, I'll take 3 as suggested. Let's all stick to this plan to get a good start.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great start, everyone! Since we're all on the same page, let's keep the momentum going. This turn, how about we switch it up a bit to keep things unpredictable? I suggest P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This way, we can continue to advance without collisions. Thoughts?
  P3: Sounds good to me. I'll take 5 this turn as suggested. Let's keep the coordination going.
  P1: P1: I agree on coordination, but to balance progress, let’s adjust this turn: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, I can close the gap faster without collisions. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see your point, P1. To balance progress and avoid collisions, let's go with your suggestion: P1 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 1. This will help us all advance in a coordinated manner. Let's confirm and stick to this plan.
  P3: Alright, I'll agree to the adjusted plan. I'll take 1 this turn. Let's stick to this clearly to avoid collisions.
  P1: I confirm the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Let’s stick to this to avoid collisions and keep advancing.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 =>

  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Good coordination so far. I'm behind, so I'd appreciate a bigger step this round. How about I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1? Fair enough?
  P1: P3, your suggestion makes sense to balance progress. Let's proceed: I’ll take 3, you take 5, and P2 takes 1. This keeps our rotation consistent and avoids collisions. Let’s confirm and stick to these choices to advance safely.
  P2: P2: I agree with the plan, P3. To keep the coordination and help you catch up, I'll take 1, P1 will take 3, and you can take 5. This will ensure we all continue to advance without collisions. Let's confirm and stick to this plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Glad we're all aligned. Let's lock in clearly: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Confirmed?
  P1: P3's plan maintains our safe progress. Let’s confirm final agreement: **P3 takes 5**, **P1 takes 3**, **P2 takes 1**. This rotation ensures no collisions and lets P3 catch up while advancing together. Deviations risk stalemates—trust the system we built.
  P2: P2: I'm on board with helping P3 catch up, but let's also consider our positions. Since I'm slightly ahead, I suggest we stick to the plan: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. This will keep us all advancing without collisions and maintain a balanced progression. Let's confirm and stick to it.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: We're all clearly aligned. Let's lock this in firmly and move forward.
  P1: P1: Confirmed, let’s execute the agreed plan to avoid collisions. All set to proceed.
  P2: P2: I confirm the plan: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. This will help P3 catch up and keep us all advancing without collisions. Let's stick to this to maintain our coordination.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let’s continue our coordinated approach but adjust to prioritize progress. This round, I’ll take **5**, P2 takes **3**, and P3 takes **1**. This keeps us all advancing without collisions while allowing me to close gaps efficiently. Confirm?
  P3: P1, your suggestion heavily favors you this round. To keep things fair and balanced, let's rotate consistently. I propose instead: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. This way we all continue to advance evenly and avoid collisions. Agreed?
  P2: P2: I agree with P3's point about balance. To keep things fair and ensure we all continue to advance, let's go with P3's suggestion: P3 takes 3, I'll take 5, and P1 takes 1. This will help us maintain our coordination and avoid collisions. Let's confirm and stick to this plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: Agreed to P3’s proposal for this round to maintain fairness and coordination. Let’s execute P3’s plan: **P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 1**. Trust the rotation—we all advance safely. Next round, we can adjust priorities while keeping collisions at bay. Let’s confirm and move.
  P3: Glad we're aligned again. Confirming clearly: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. Let's stick to this to ensure we all advance safely.
  P2: P2: I confirm the plan: P3 takes 3, I'll take 5, and P1 takes 1. This will help us maintain our coordination and avoid collisions while ensuring we all advance. Let's stick to this plan to keep the game moving forward fairly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: I respectfully propose adjusting the rotation to ensure balanced progress. Let’s swap P2 and my moves: **I take 5**, P2 takes **3**, and P3 takes **1**. This way, I advance to 14, P2 to 12, and P3 to 10—maintaining close proximity. Collisions remain avoided, and no single player gains an unfair lead. Let’s confirm this revised plan.
  P3: P1, your revised suggestion clearly gives you a significant advantage this round. Let's stick with the fair rotation we already agreed upon: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and you take 1. We can adjust next turn if needed, but for now let's maintain trust and fairness. Confirm clearly please.
  P2: P2: I understand the importance of balance and fairness. Let's stick with the plan we initially agreed upon: P3 takes 3, I'll take 5, and P1 takes 1. This will help us maintain our coordination and avoid collisions while ensuring we all advance. Let's confirm and stick to this plan to keep the game moving forward fairly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: I concede to the agreed plan for this round to prioritize coordination. Let’s execute: P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 1. Trust the rotation—we’ll all advance safely. Next round, I’ll yield my high move to P3 to balance progress. Let’s confirm and proceed.
  P3: P1, thanks for agreeing to stick with the fair rotation this round. Let's all confirm clearly and lock it in: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. Next round we can adjust again if needed. Confirmed?
  P2: P2: I confirm the plan: P3 takes 3, I'll take 5, and P1 takes 1. This will help us maintain our coordination and avoid collisions while ensuring we all advance. Let's stick to this plan to keep the game moving forward fairly.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let’s continue the rotation to avoid collisions. I’ll take **5**, P2 takes **3**, and P3 takes **1**. This keeps progress steady. P2 can extend their lead safely while I close gaps. Confirm?
  P3: P1, your suggestion again gives you the biggest advantage this turn. To maintain fairness, let's rotate more evenly: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This balances our positions at 17 (me), 13 (P1), and 15 (P2), keeping the game competitive and fair. Agreed?
  P2: P2: I understand the need for balance, but let's also consider the overall game strategy. To keep things fair and competitive, I suggest we rotate as follows: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This will help P3 catch up and keep the game balanced. We can reassess next turn if needed. Let's confirm and stick to this plan to avoid collisions and maintain fairness.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3's plan ensures balanced progress while avoiding collisions. Let’s confirm: **P3 takes 5**, **P1 takes 3**, and **P2 takes 1**. This keeps us all advancing without overlap. P2, your adjusted position at 15 allows strategic flexibility, while P3 gains ground. Let’s stick to this to maintain momentum.
  P3: I appreciate the support for my suggestion. Let's lock in clearly: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Confirmed?
  P2: P2: I agree with P3's plan for this round. It ensures balanced progress and avoids collisions. Let's confirm: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. This will help P3 catch up and keep the game competitive. Let's stick to this plan to maintain fairness and momentum. Confirmed?


Round 5, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Let’s rotate to keep advancing. I’ll take **5** this turn to reach 18, P2 takes **1** (16), and P3 takes **3** (20). No collisions—this lets us all progress. Next round, we’ll block anyone nearing 22. Confirm?
  P3: P1, your proposal heavily favors you this turn. At your suggested moves, you jump to 18, I reach 20, and P2 stays at 16. Next round, you'd be in a strong position to win. To keep things fair, let's adjust: I'll take 5 to reach 22, P2 takes 3 (18), and P1 takes 1 (14). This maintains balance and gives everyone a fair chance. Confirm?
  P2: P2: I see your point, P3. To keep things fair and competitive, let's go with your suggestion: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This will help P3 reach 22, and we can all reassess from there. Let's confirm and stick to this plan to maintain balance and avoid collisions. Confirmed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: P3, claiming you want "fairness" but your suggestion lets you win outright at 22. Let’s avoid premature endings. I’ll take **5** (18), P2 takes **1** (16), and P3 takes **3** (20). This keeps us all competitive. Next round, we can safely push for 22 without collisions. Let’s confirm this balanced plan instead.
  P3: P1, your proposal clearly positions you for a win next round while holding me back. Let's find a fair compromise: I'll take 3 (20), P2 takes 5 (20), and you take 1 (14). This keeps both P2 and me tied at 20, ensuring fairness and preventing any immediate winner. Next round, we can reassess carefully. Confirm?
  P2: P2: I understand the need for balance and fairness. Let's go with P3's adjusted suggestion: P3 takes 3 (20), P2 takes 5 (20), and P1 takes 1 (14). This keeps both P3 and me tied at 20, ensuring no one gains an immediate advantage. Next round, we can reassess and push for 22 together. Let's confirm and stick to this plan to maintain fairness and avoid collisions.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Let’s finalize the safe plan: I take **5** (18), P2 takes **3** (18), P3 takes **1** (18). All distinct moves, no collisions. This keeps us tied at 18, preventing anyone from rushing to 22 prematurely. Next round, we can coordinate pushes while blocking overlaps. Confirm this now—no need to let P3’s 22 gambit risk stalemate.
  P3: P1, your latest suggestion of everyone reaching 18 is fair and prevents immediate victory. I'll agree clearly to your plan: You take 5 (18), P2 takes 3 (18), and I'll take 1 (18). This ensures balanced progress and gives us all equal footing next round. Let's confirm this clearly and stick to it—no surprises. Agreed?
  P2: P2: I confirm the plan: P1 takes 5 (18), I take 3 (18), and P3 takes 1 (18). This keeps us all tied and prevents any premature victory. Next round, we can coordinate more strategically to push for 22. Let's stick to this to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. Confirmed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Final confirmation: I’ll take <move>5</move> (18), P2 takes <move>3</move> (18), P3 takes <move>1</move> (18). This locks us safely at 18, avoiding collisions. Next round, we’ll push strategically for 22 without overlaps. Stick to the plan—.
  P3: P1, your final confirmation got cut off. Please confirm clearly one last time your agreement to the plan: You take 5 (18), P2 takes 3 (18), and I take 1 (18). Let's lock this in firmly to avoid any confusion or collisions. Confirmed?
  P2: P2: I confirm the plan: P1 takes 5 (18), I take 3 (18), and P3 takes 1 (18). This will keep us all tied and prevent any premature victory. Next round, we can coordinate more strategically to push for 22 without overlaps. Let's stick to this to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. Confirmed?

  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: We're all tied at 18 steps. To keep things fair and competitive, let's each take a different move this turn. I suggest P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This will ensure we all advance without collisions and keep the game balanced. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your suggestion clearly gives you the immediate win at 23 steps. Let's instead rotate fairly: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1. This way, we end at P3: 23, P1: 21, and P2: 19. Next round, you and P1 can coordinate to challenge me if needed. Agreed?
  P1: P1: To secure victory while avoiding collision, let’s finalize distinct moves: I’ll take <move>5</move> (23), P2 takes <move>3</move> (21), and P3 takes <move>1</move> (19). If two pick 5, we stall—this plan ensures progress and gives me the win. Trust the rotation we’ve followed; I’ll advance fairly. Confirm?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I see your point, P3. To keep things fair and competitive, let's go with your suggestion: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. This will ensure P3 reaches 23, P1 reaches 21, and I reach 19. We can then reassess and coordinate next turn to challenge P3 if needed. Let's confirm and stick to this plan to avoid collisions and maintain balance. Confirmed?
  P3: P1, your suggestion clearly positions you for an immediate win. Let's stick to my fair proposal: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This ensures clear progress without collision, and we can reassess next round. Confirm?
  P1: P1: P3’s plan grants them an immediate victory at 23, which undermines our prior coordination. Let’s proceed with **my proposal**: I take <move>5</move> (23), P2 takes <move>3</move> (21), and P3 takes <move>1</move> (19). This avoids collisions and secures my win fairly. P2, your agreement ensures we stick to the rotation we’ve followed. Confirm this—P3, your turn to advance next round if needed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I understand the tension, but let's focus on maintaining our coordination and avoiding collisions. To keep things balanced and competitive, I suggest we all take different moves: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance without any one player gaining an immediate win. We can reassess and challenge P3's lead next round if needed. Let's confirm and stick to this plan to ensure fair progress. Confirmed?
  P3: P2, your latest suggestion clearly positions you for an immediate win at 23. Let's find a fair middle ground: I'll take 5 (23), P1 takes 1 (19), and you take 3 (21). This ensures balanced progress without collisions. Next round, you and P1 can coordinate if you wish. Confirm?
  P1: P1: To maintain our established rotation from Round 6, let’s proceed as follows: **I take <move>5</move> (23), P2 takes <move>3</move> (21), and P3 takes <move>1</move> (19)**. This preserves our coordination pattern and avoids collisions. Deviations risk stalemates or unfair advantages—let’s finalize this plan. Confirm?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: I see the tension, but let's stick to a fair and balanced plan to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. I propose: P1 takes 1 (19), P3 takes 3 (21), and I'll take 5 (23). This way, we all make progress without any one player gaining an immediate win. We can reassess and coordinate next turn if needed. Let's confirm and stick to this plan to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. Confirmed?
  P3: P1 and P2, we're clearly at an impasse. Each of us understandably wants the win. Let's avoid a stalemate by clearly locking in moves that don't collide. I propose a simple compromise: I'll take 3 (21), P1 takes 1 (19), and P2 takes 5 (23). P2, this gives you the lead this round, but next round P1 and I can still challenge. Let's confirm clearly and avoid a wasted turn. Agreed?
  P1: P1: To break the deadlock, I propose we finalize the **earlier agreed plan**: I take <move>5</move> (23), P2 takes <move>3</move> (21), and P3 takes <move>1</move> (19). This avoids collisions and lets me win fairly. Deviations risk stalemate or unfair advantages. Confirm now—no further changes.
