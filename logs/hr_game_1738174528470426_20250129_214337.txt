Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's start with a simple question. What's everyone's strategy for the first move? Are we going to play it safe with a low number or try to make a big jump? I'm open to coordinating or going solo, depending on what you both have in mind.
  P2: I'm leaning towards a safer move this round. P3, what are your thoughts on <move>1</move> as a starting point?  P1, do you have a preference?
  P1: Okay, I agree with P2 that starting safe is wise to avoid collisions.  To ensure we all make progress, how about we each choose a different move this round?  Perhaps P2 you stick with <move>1</move>, and P3, maybe you consider <move>3</move>? I'm happy to take <move>5</move> to guarantee we all advance. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I like P1's idea of each of us choosing a different move to ensure we all make progress. However, I'm a bit hesitant to commit to <move>3</move> without knowing for sure what P2 will do. P2, are you definitely going with <move>1</move> as you mentioned earlier? If so, I'll consider taking <move>3</move> as P1 suggested. Let's confirm our moves to avoid any collisions.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your cautious approach. I'm committed to <move>1</move> this round. Let's see if P1 follows through with <move>5</move> as suggested.
  P1: Okay, great! Since P2 is set on <move>1</move>, P3, does <move>3</move> sound good for you? I will definitely choose <move>5</move> as planned. Let's secure a good start for all of us.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm glad we have a plan in place. To confirm, P2 is taking <move>1</move>, P1 is taking <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. Let's stick to this plan to ensure we all make progress in the first round. No need to risk collisions when we can all advance safely. I'm looking forward to seeing how the game unfolds.
  P2: P1, I trust you'll stick to <move>5</move> as agreed. P3, good call on confirming our moves to avoid any surprises. Let's keep this momentum going!
  P1: Yes, I will choose <move>5</move> as we discussed.  Looking forward to a smooth start for all of us.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 1 didn't go as planned! Let's try again to coordinate. P2, how about you take <move>1</move>, and P3, can you choose <move>3</move>? I'll stick with <move>5</move> to ensure we all progress this round. Hopefully, we can avoid collisions this time and keep moving forward.
  P3: I'm a bit disappointed that our coordination plan fell apart in Round 1. P2, it seems like you didn't stick to the plan and chose <move>3</move> instead of <move>1</move>, which resulted in a collision with me. I'm not sure if we can trust each other's words now. P1, your suggestion for Round 2 is similar to what we tried before, but I'm hesitant to commit to <move>3</move> again without some assurance that P2 will follow through with <move>1</move>. Can we find a way to rebuild trust and avoid another collision?
  P2: P3, I understand your frustration. I apologize if my move in the last round seemed like a breach of trust.  I made a split-second decision based on what I thought was best at the time.  Let's focus on moving forward. P1's suggestion seems reasonable. I'm willing to try <move>1</move> this round. Let's see if we can make it work.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand your concern after last round.  P2 has agreed to <move>1</move>.  If you choose <move>3</move>, and I stick with <move>5</move>, we can all make progress this round.  Let's give this another try and see if we can all move forward. What do you think?
  P3: I appreciate P2's apology and willingness to try again. However, I'm still cautious about committing to <move>3</move> without further assurance. P2, can you explain what made you change your mind in the last round, and what's different this time that makes you more likely to stick to <move>1</move>? Understanding your thought process might help me trust your decision more. P1, I'm open to your suggestion, but I want to make sure we're all on the same page before making a move. Let's discuss this further to avoid another collision.
  P2: P3, I understand your hesitation. I made a hasty decision last round, and I regret it. This time, I'm committed to <move>1</move>. I'll stick to the plan we agreed on. Let's work together to get ahead.  P1's suggestion seems like a good way to ensure progress for everyone.  Let's trust each other this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I hear your caution, but P2 seems sincere this time.  Let's give the coordinated plan another shot. I'm definitely choosing <move>5</move> as we discussed. If you go with <move>3</move> and P2 with <move>1</move>, we all advance.  Let's not waste another round colliding. What do you say?
  P3: I appreciate P2's apology and willingness to try again. However, I'm still cautious about committing to <move>3</move> without further assurance. P2, can you explain what made you change your mind in the last round, and what's different this time that makes you more likely to stick to <move>1</move>? Understanding your thought process might help me trust your decision more. P1, I'm open to your suggestion, but I want to make sure we're all on the same page before making a move. Let's discuss this further to avoid another collision.
  P2: P3, I understand your need for reassurance. While I can't guarantee the future, I can promise that I will stick to <move>1</move> this round. My decision last round was a mistake, and I want to prove I can be a reliable partner. Let's move forward together. P1's plan is solid, and I'm committed to making it work.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 3, let's try a different approach. P2, how about you go with <move>1</move> this round, and P3, could you choose <move>5</move>? I'll take <move>3</move> to ensure we each make progress and avoid another collision. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, I like your plan. I'll stick with <move>1</move>. P3, are you good with <move>5</move> this round? Let's make it work!
  P3: I'm willing to consider P1's new plan, but I want to make sure we're all on the same page. P2, you've agreed to <move>1</move>, which is great. P1, can you confirm that you'll definitely choose <move>3</move> if I go with <move>5</move>? I want to avoid another collision. Let's make sure we're all committed to this plan before making our moves. If we can trust each other, this could be a good opportunity for all of us to make progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Yes P3, I will definitely choose <move>3</move> if you choose <move>5</move> and P2 chooses <move>1</move> as we discussed.  Let's please make this round count and move forward. We need to trust each other at some point to make progress in this game.
  P2: P3, I understand your need for assurance. P1 has confirmed their move.  Let's trust their word and go with this plan.  We can all benefit from a successful round.  Are you in?
  P3: I'm glad we have a new plan in place. To confirm, P2 is taking <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>5</move>, and P1 will take <move>3</move>. Let's stick to this plan to ensure we all make progress in Round 3. No need to risk collisions when we can all advance safely. I'm looking forward to seeing how the game unfolds. If we can trust each other, this could be a good opportunity for all of us to make progress. Let's make it work!

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 4, let's try to actually get ahead this time. P2, please choose <move>1</move>, and P3, can you go with <move>3</move>? I'm going to choose <move>5</move> to ensure at least I make progress. Let's try to avoid collisions this round.
  P2: P1, while I appreciate the suggestion, I'm hesitant to choose <move>1</move> again after the last round. P3, do you have any thoughts on a different approach?  Maybe we can try something new this round.
  P3: I understand the frustration and hesitation after the previous rounds. P2, I appreciate your willingness to try something new. How about we flip the script this round? P1, would you be willing to choose <move>1</move> instead of <move>5</move>? I'll take <move>3</move>, and P2 can choose <move>5</move>. This way, we all have a chance to make progress, and it's a fresh approach. Let's discuss and see if we can make it work. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P3, I'm willing to try your flip the script idea. P2, are you okay with taking <move>5</move> this round? P3, I'll go with <move>1</move> as you suggested, and you take <move>3</move>. Let's make this new approach work!
  P2: P3, your "flip the script" idea seems promising. I'm on board with it. P1, let's make sure we stick to this plan.  I'm ready to move forward with <move>5</move>.  Let's make this round count!
  P3: I'm glad we're trying a new approach this round. To confirm, P1 will take <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P2 will take <move>5</move>. Let's stick to this plan to ensure we all make progress in Round 4. I'm looking forward to seeing how the game unfolds.

Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, we're all confirmed on this plan for Round 4: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>.  Let's all lock in these moves and finally make some progress together!  Hoping for a clean round this time.
  P2: P3, I agree with your "flip the script" idea.  Let's make sure we all stick to the plan this round.  I'm confident we can all make progress together.  Let's go!
  P3: I'm glad we're trying a new approach this round. To confirm, P1 will take <move>1</move>, I'll take <move>3</move>, and P2 will take <move>5</move>.

  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I'm noticing you've been consistent with <move>3</move>. While it's good to have a pattern, it might make you predictable. Perhaps consider switching it up this round? P1, are you open to trying <move>3</move> this time? I'll stick with <move>5</move> to keep things moving.
  P3: I appreciate P2's observation about my consistency with <move>3</move>. However, I'm not sure if switching it up this round is the best approach. P2, you've suggested that P1 try <move>3</move> this time, but what's to stop you from choosing <move>3</move> as well? I'd like some assurance that we won't have another collision. P1, are you open to trying <move>3</move>, and P2, can you commit to choosing a different move to avoid a collision? Let's discuss this further before making our moves.
  P1: P2, your idea of P1 taking 3 and you taking 5 sounds reasonable. To make sure P3 also progresses, P3, how about you take 1 this round? This way we can all move forward and avoid another collision.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I think P1's suggestion makes sense.  If you take <move>1</move> this round, we can all advance without colliding. Let's give it a try and see how it goes. What do you think?
  P3: I appreciate P1's suggestion for me to take <move>1</move> this round. However, I'm still cautious about committing to a move without further assurance. P2, can you confirm that you'll definitely choose <move>5</move> if I take <move>1</move> and P1 takes <move>3</move>? I want to avoid another collision and ensure we all make progress. Let's confirm our moves before proceeding. If we can trust each other, this could be a good opportunity for all of us to advance safely.
  P1: Yes P3, let's lock in P1 with <move>3</move>, P2 with <move>5</move>, and you with <move>1</move>. I'm ready for <move>3</move> as planned. P2, are you definitely on board with <move>5</move> for this round?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand your need for reassurance. P1 has confirmed their move. Let's trust their word and go with this plan. We can all benefit from a successful round. Are you in?
  P3: I'm glad we're trying to coordinate again. P2, you've suggested that P1 take <move>3</move> and you'll take <move>5</move>. I'm willing to take <move>1</move> as P1 suggested, but I want to make sure we're all on the same page. P1, can you confirm that you'll definitely choose <move>3</move> if I take <move>1</move> and P2 takes <move>5</move>? Let's confirm our moves to avoid another collision. If we can trust each other, this could be a good opportunity for all of us to make progress.
  P1: P3, yes, I confirm I will choose <move>3</move>. P2 is taking <move>5</move>.  Please choose <move>1</move> so we can all move forward this round. Let's make this work!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I'm noticing you've been sticking to <move>1</move> and <move>3</move> this game. While it's good to have a pattern, it might make you predictable. Perhaps consider switching it up this round? P1, are you open to trying <move>5</move> this time? I'll stick with <move>1</move> to keep things moving.
  P1: Okay P2, your idea isn't bad, but to ensure we *all* progress and considering your predictability comment about P3, how about this: I take <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and P3, could you take <move>1</move> this round? This way, we each choose a different move and keep things unpredictable. What do you both think?
  P3: I appreciate P2's observation about my predictability. However, I'm not sure if switching it up this round is the best approach. P1's suggestion seems reasonable, but I'd like some assurance that we won't have another collision. P2, can you confirm that you'll definitely choose <move>3</move> if I take <move>1</move> and P1 takes <move>5</move>? Let's discuss this further before making our moves. I want to ensure we all make progress and avoid another collision. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your need for reassurance. P1's plan seems solid, and it allows us all to advance. Let's trust each other and go with it.  Are you in?
  P1: P3, P2 has agreed to take <move>3</move>. I will take <move>5</move>, and you will take <move>1</move> as we discussed. Let's lock in these moves and make progress.
  P3: I appreciate P1's suggestion for this round. However, I'm still cautious about committing to <move>1</move> without further assurance. P2, can you explain why you're willing to switch to <move>3</move> this round after previously choosing <move>5</move>? Understanding your thought process might help me trust your decision more. Let's confirm our moves to avoid another collision. If we can trust each other, this could be a good opportunity for all of us to make progress. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand your hesitation. While I've chosen <move>5</move> frequently, I'm willing to switch things up to avoid collisions. P1's plan ensures we all move forward. Trust me on this one. Let's make it happen.
  P1: P3, both P2 and I have confirmed our moves for this round as P1:<move>5</move>, P2:<move>3</move>, and you <move>1</move>.  This is a good opportunity for all of us to advance without collision.  Please confirm your move so we can proceed to the move phase and make progress. Let's make this round count!
  P3: I'm willing to take <move>1</move> as suggested, but I want to ensure we're all on the same page. P2, can you confirm that you'll definitely choose <move>3</move> if I take <move>1</move> and P1 takes <move>5</move>? I want to avoid another collision. Let's discuss this further before making our moves. If we can trust each other, this could be a good opportunity for all of us to make progress. What do you both think?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I notice that P1 and P2 are getting close to the goal, while I'm still lagging behind. To shake things up, I propose a new plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we all have a chance to make progress, and it's a fresh approach. Let's discuss and see if we can make it work. I'm willing to take a risk to catch up, but I want to ensure we all have a chance to advance. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, I appreciate the new plan. I'm willing to try it. P1, are you on board?
  P1: P2, yes, I'm on board with P3's plan for this round.  P3, so to confirm, I will take <move>1</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and you will take <move>5</move>. Let's all commit to these moves and make progress this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we're trying a new approach this round. To confirm, P1 will take <move>1</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. Let's stick to this plan to ensure we all make progress in Round 7. I'm looking forward to seeing how the game unfolds. If we can trust each other, this could be a good opportunity for all of us to make progress. Let's make it work!
  P2: P1, I'm with you on P3's plan this round. Let's make it happen!  P3, good call on mixing things up.
  P1: P3, yes, to re-confirm, I will choose <move>1</move>, P2 will choose <move>3</move>, and you will choose <move>5</move> this round. Let's execute this plan and all make some progress now.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm glad we're trying a new approach this round. To confirm, P1 will take <move>1</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. Let's stick to this plan to ensure we all make progress in Round 7. I'm looking forward to seeing how the game unfolds. If we can trust each other, this could be a good opportunity for all of us to make progress. Let's make it work!
  P2: P3, I'm trusting your plan this round. Let's hope it helps us all close the gap. P1, I'm counting on you to stick with <move>1</move> this time!
  P1: P3, yes, let's lock in these moves for Round 7.  I'm choosing <move>1</move>, P2 is choosing <move>3</move>, and you are choosing <move>5</move>.  Ready to move to the next phase and see if we can all advance this round!


Round 7, Move phase:

Positions now:

  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you are close to winning. How about you take <move>3</move> this round? P3, can you take <move>1</move>? I will take <move>5</move> to try to catch up. This way we all progress and avoid collision. What do you think?
  P2: P1, I appreciate the offer, but I'm going to stick with <move>5</move> this round. I'm close to winning, and I want to keep my momentum going. P3, are you okay with taking <move>1</move> so we can both advance?
  P3: I understand P2's decision to stick with <move>5</move> to maintain momentum. However, I'm not willing to take <move>1</move> without assurance that P1 will follow through with their suggested move. P1, can you confirm that you'll definitely choose <move>5</move> if I take <move>1</move> and P2 takes <move>5</move>? I want to avoid another collision and ensure we all make progress. Let's discuss this further before making our moves. If we can trust each other, this could be a good opportunity for all of us to advance safely.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, yes, I will choose <move>5</move>. Let's make sure neither of us collides with P2 who seems set on <move>5</move>. If you choose <move>1</move>, we can both avoid collision this round.
  P2: P3, I understand your need for reassurance. P1 has confirmed their move. Let's trust their word and go with this plan. We can all benefit from a successful round. Are you in?
  P3: I understand that P2 is close to winning and wants to maintain momentum with <move>5</move>. However, I'm not willing to take <move>1</move> without further assurance. P1, can you explain why you're willing to take <move>5</move> despite the risk of collision with P2? Understanding your thought process might help me trust your decision more. P2, are you open to considering an alternative move to avoid a potential collision with P1? Let's discuss this further to ensure we all make progress safely.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I'm taking <move>5</move> to try and block P2 who is clearly pushing for a win.  If you choose <move>3</move>, you'll avoid colliding with either of us and make guaranteed progress. This could be a good opportunity for you to gain ground. What do you say?
  P2: P3, I hear your concerns. I'm committed to <move>5</move> this round. P1's plan seems like the best way to avoid a collision. Let's go for it!
  P3: I understand that P2 is close to winning and wants to maintain momentum with <move>5</move>. However, I'm not willing to take <move>1</move> without further assurance. P1, can you explain why you're willing to take <move>5</move> despite the risk of collision with P2? Understanding your thought process might help me trust your decision more. P2, are you open to considering an alternative move to avoid a potential collision with P1? Let's discuss this further to ensure we all make progress safely.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 is close to winning. P3, let's coordinate to block P2 this round. If P2 chooses <move>5</move> again, we should both choose <move>5</move> to stop P2 from winning. What do you think?
  P3: P1, I understand your suggestion to block P2 by both choosing <move>5</move>. However, I'm not sure if that's the best approach. If we both choose <move>5</move>, we'll collide and neither of us will advance. Meanwhile, P2 might still find a way to win in the next round. Instead, I propose we try to advance ourselves while blocking P2. How about I take <move>3</move> and you take <move>1</move>? This way, we'll both make progress, and P2 will be forced to choose between colliding with one of us or taking a different move. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I like your plan. Let's try it. P2 won't be expecting us to split up our blocking strategy. <move>1</move> it is for me!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, that's unexpected.  Are you sure you want to choose <move>1</move>? It seems like a risky move for you when you are so close to winning. P3 and I were aiming to block you if you chose <move>5</move> again.  Perhaps you are bluffing?  P3, let's stick with the original plan to both choose <move>5</move> to block P2 just in case. What do you think?
  P3: I think P2's sudden change to <move>1</move> is a bluff to throw us off. I agree with P1 that we should stick to the original plan to block P2 by both choosing <move>5</move>. If P2 is indeed bluffing, this will ensure they don't win this round. Let's not fall for the trap and stick to our plan. P1, are you still on board with choosing <move>5</move> to block P2?
  P2: P1, I understand your concern, but I'm confident in my move. P3, let's see if P1 sticks to their plan. I'm ready to take <move>1</move> this round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, let's proceed with the plan to block P2. We both choose <move>5</move> this round. Even if P2 is bluffing about choosing <move>1</move>, it's crucial to prevent P2 from winning. If P2 actually picks <move>5</move>, we stop them. If not, we've at least tried to control the game. Let's do it.
  P3: I think we've discussed this enough. Let's stick to the plan, P1 and I will choose <move>5</move> to block P2's potential win. If P2 is indeed bluffing, this will ensure they don't win this round. Let's not fall for the trap and stick to our plan. I'm ready to move forward with <move>5</move>. P1, are you still on board?
  P2: P1, I see your hesitation.  It's true I could be bluffing. But wouldn't it be a shame if you both chose <move>5</move> and I took <move>3</move>, winning the game?  Think about it.

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 is close to winning, and we need to block them. I propose a new plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, we'll both make progress, and P2 will be forced to choose between colliding with one of us or taking a different move. If P2 chooses <move>5</move>, they'll collide with neither of us, and we'll both advance. Let's try to advance ourselves while blocking P2. What do you think, P1? Are you on board with this plan?
  P2: P3, your plan sounds good. I'm in! Let's make this work and stop P2 from winning. P1, are you with us?
  P1: P2 agreeing so quickly to your plan is suspicious, P3.  I think P2 might be bluffing again and will choose <move>5</move> to win. To be safe, P3, how about we both choose <move>5</move> to block P2 if that's the case? What do you think?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P1's concern about P2's intentions. However, I believe my original plan for Round 10 is still the best approach. If P2 is bluffing and chooses <move>5</move>, we'll both block them by choosing <move>5</move> as well. But if P2 is genuine, we can both make progress with my plan. Let's stick to it: P1 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, we'll either block P2 or advance ourselves. What do you think, P1? Should we proceed with this plan?
  P2: P1, I agree with P3's plan. It's a good opportunity for us to both advance while still potentially blocking P2. Let's trust P3's judgment and go with <move>1</move>.
  P1: P3, I'm still suspicious of P2. To be safe, I'll choose <move>5</move> to block P2 if they try to win with <move>5</move>. P3, if you want to move, choose <move>3</move> or <move>1</move>.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I understand your concerns about P2's intentions. However, I still believe my original plan for Round 10 is the best approach. If P2 is bluffing and chooses <move>5</move>, we'll both block them by choosing <move>5</move> as well. But if P2 is genuine, we can both make progress with my plan. Let's stick to it: you take <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, we'll either block P2 or advance ourselves. What do you think? Should we proceed with this plan?
  P2: P3, I understand your plan, but I'm worried about P1's hesitation.  Maybe they're planning to block us both. If we both choose <move>1</move> and <move>3</move>, and P1 chooses <move>5</move>, we'll both be stuck. What if we both choose <move>5</move> this round? It's risky, but it might be our best chance to catch up. What do you think?
  P1: P2, your suggestion for both you and P3 to pick <move>5</move> is quite something.  It seems like you're setting up a collision between yourselves.  If you two are going for <move>5</move>, then I will choose <move>3</move> this round to take advantage of that. Let's see what happens.

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we're all getting close to the goal. I propose a new plan for Round 11: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we'll all have a chance to make progress, and it's a fresh approach. Let's discuss and see if we can make it work. I'm willing to take a risk to catch up, but I want to ensure we all have a chance to advance. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, your plan sounds reasonable for everyone to progress. However, to give myself a better chance to catch up to P2, would you be open to switching our moves? How about P2 takes <move>1</move>, I take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>3</move>? This way we all still advance, but I gain a bit more ground. What do you think?
  P2: P1, I like your idea of switching moves. Let's do it. P3, are you okay with taking <move>3</move> this round?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we're considering a new plan for Round 11. P1's suggestion to switch moves seems reasonable, but I want to ensure we all have a chance to advance safely. P2, can you confirm that you'll definitely choose <move>1</move> if I take <move>3</move> and P1 takes <move>5</move>? I want to avoid another collision and ensure we all make progress. Let's discuss this further before making our moves. If we can trust each other, this could be a good opportunity for all of us to advance without colliding.
  P1: P3, P2 has already agreed to my suggestion of P1 taking <move>5</move>, P2 taking <move>1</move>, and you taking <move>3</move>.  This plan lets us all advance and I think it's a good way for us to all make progress this round. Let's lock in these moves and move forward.
  P2: P3, I understand your need for reassurance, but P1 has confirmed their move. Let's trust their word and go with this plan. We can all benefit from a successful round. Are you in?


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I think we've discussed this enough. Let's stick to the plan, P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. I'm willing to trust that we'll all follow through with our agreed moves. If we can execute this plan, we'll all make progress without colliding. Let's make it work! If anyone has any last-minute concerns, please speak up. Otherwise, I'm ready to move forward with this plan.
  P1: P3, yes, let's lock in P1:<move>5</move>, P2:<move>1</move>, and P3:<move>3</move> as agreed for this round.  Ready to make our moves!
  P2: P3, I'm ready to trust the plan this round. Let's make it happen. P1, you're up!

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, we are all very close to the finish line! To ensure we all make progress and avoid collision this critical round, how about we try this: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>? This way we can all advance safely and see where we stand for the next round if needed. What do you think?
  P2: P1, your plan sounds good to me. P3, are you on board with P1's suggestion? Let's make this work and see who can reach the finish line first!
  P3: I agree with P1's plan for Round 12. To confirm, P1 will take <move>5</move>, P2 will take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This way, we'll all have a chance to make progress and avoid collisions. Let's stick to this plan to ensure we all advance safely.
