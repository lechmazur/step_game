Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try to avoid collisions so we can all move forward. If we coordinate, we can ensure that at least someone gets ahead each round. What are you both thinking of choosing?
  P2: I agree, P1. To avoid collisions, let's each choose different moves. How about P1 picks <move>5, I take <move>3, and P3 selects <move>1?
  P3: Okay, I'm happy to go along with that plan for this round, P1 and P2. I'll choose <move>1. Let's see if it works!


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good to me, P2 and P3. If we stick to this plan, we can avoid collisions and make solid progress. Let's see how this round plays out.
  P2: Sounds good. Let's follow our agreed moves this round and see how it goes. Looking forward to making progress together!
  P3: Okay, everyone, let's stick to the plan this round: P1 takes <move>5, P2 takes <move>3, and I take <move>1. Hopefully, we all move forward!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Great, we all seem to be in agreement. Let's stick to the plan and see how it plays out. If this works smoothly, we can consider similar coordination in future rounds. Good luck!
  P2: 
  P3: Okay, everyone, since we're all in agreement, let's execute the plan for this round. P1 chooses <move>5, P2 chooses <move>3, and I choose <move>1. Good luck to us all!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's continue our steady progress to avoid collisions. I'll choose <move>3 this round. What are your plans?
  P3: Okay, I'll take <move>1 again this round. P1, can you take <move>5? Let's keep the same strategy if it's working for you.
  P1: Sounds good to me, P3. I'll take <move>5> again this round. If we all stick to the same choices as last time, we can continue making steady progress without collisions. Let’s keep this coordination going for now!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To improve my standing, I'm planning to switch to <move>5 this round. I hope that's alright with both of you. Let me know your thoughts!
  P3: P2, that changes things. I was planning on <move>1 again. P1, what do you think? Should we stick to the original plan of P1=<move>5, P2=<move>3, P3=<move>1, or adjust? I'm okay with either, but we need to decide quickly.
  P1: P2, if you switch to <move>5, that means we would collide, and neither of us would move forward. That would hurt both of us while P3 still progresses. I suggest we stick to the original plan so we all keep advancing. If you really need to change, maybe take <move>1> instead? Let’s avoid unnecessary collisions. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand, P1. Let’s stick to our original plan: P1 chooses <move>5, I choose <move>3, and P3 chooses <move>1. This way, we can all advance without collisions and keep making steady progress.
  P3: Okay, great! So, to confirm, P1 will take <move>5, P2 will take <move>3, and I will take <move>1. Let's make sure we all choose those moves in the next phase. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Everything seems settled. We all agreed to stick to the original plan: I take <move>5, P2 takes <move>3, and P3 takes <move>1. If we all follow through, we continue making progress without collisions. Let’s keep this up.


Round 2, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'll choose <move>5 this round to make strong progress. To avoid any collisions, could P1 take <move>1 and P3 take <move>3? This way, we can all advance smoothly and move closer to winning. Let’s work together to keep things running efficiently!
  P1: P2, last round you broke our agreement and caused a collision, preventing both of us from advancing. Now you're asking me to take <move>1, which slows me down while you take <move>5 for maximum progress. Why should I trust you this time? P3, what do you think? Should we work together to counter P2’s aggressive push? I'm open to strategies that benefit us both.
  P3: P1, I agree with you. P2 is trying to take advantage. P2, I'm not taking <move>3. P1, how about we both pick <move>5 this round? That way, P2 doesn't move, and we can reassess next round. If P2 is willing to cooperate after that, we can consider it. Otherwise, we continue blocking P2. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Understood, P1 and P3. I'll choose <move>1 this round to avoid any collisions. Let's continue working together to make steady progress. If you have any other suggestions for coordination, I'm open to hearing them!
  P1: P2, you changed your stance quickly after realizing we wouldn’t let you take <move>5> uncontested. I’m still wary of your intentions. P3, I like your thinking—we could both pick <move>5> to prevent P2 from advancing. However, if P2 truly takes <move>1>, we might be better off ensuring our own progress instead of just blocking. P3, do you prefer both of us taking <move>5>, or should we coordinate differently to maximize our gains while keeping P2 in check?
  P3: P1, I think we should both take <move>3 this round. That way, if P2 actually takes <move>1 as they said, we both progress. If P2 is lying and picks <move>3 or <move>5, then they collide with us and don't progress. It's a safer bet than both of us picking <move>5. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: To make some progress, I'll choose <move>5 this round. Let’s see how our moves affect the standings.
  P1: P2, you just said you'd take <move>1, but now you're saying <move>5>. That inconsistency makes it hard to trust you. P3, I like your idea of both of us taking <move>3>. It ensures we move forward while minimizing risk. If P2 was lying about <move>1>, they’ll collide with one of us and stay behind. I’m leaning toward this plan—what do you think? P2, if you want to regain trust, clarify your actual move now.
  P3: Okay, P1, I agree with you. P2 is clearly untrustworthy. Let's both take <move>3> this round as planned. That way, we either both progress, or P2 collides and doesn't. It's the safest option given P2's behavior. Let's do it.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'll choose <move>5 this round. P1, please take <move>3, and P3, choose <move>1> to avoid collisions and help us all advance smoothly.
  P1: P2, you've repeatedly broken agreements, so why should we trust you now? You're just trying to maximize your own progress while expecting us to accommodate you. P3, we need to ensure P2 doesn’t keep getting ahead unchecked. If we both pick <move>5>, we block P2’s progress entirely. Alternatively, we could coordinate differently to maximize our own gains while keeping P2 in check. What do you think? P2, if you want to regain trust, explain why we should believe you this time.
  P3: P1, I agree. P2 is clearly not trustworthy. Let's both pick <move>5</move> this round to block P2. If P2 is telling the truth this time and picks <move>5</move>, then we collide with them. If P2 is lying and picks <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>, it doesn't matter, because our priority is to stop P2 from advancing. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your concerns, P1 and P3. To ensure we all progress, I'll choose <move>3 this round. Let’s coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and move towards the goal together.
  P1: P2, you've changed your declared move again, which makes it hard to trust you. You say you'll take <move>3>, but you've broken agreements before. P3, I still think blocking P2 is our best move. If we both take <move>5>, we stop P2 from advancing. If P2 actually picks <move>3>, they move, but we ensure they don’t get too far ahead. What do you think? P2, if you want to prove you're trustworthy, stick to what you just said and don't change again.
  P3: P1, I agree. P2 is still untrustworthy, and blocking them is the best strategy. Let's both pick <move>5</move> this round, as planned. This stops P2 from advancing, regardless of what they actually choose. It's the safest option to keep P2 in check. Let's do it.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Understood. It seems we have different strategies this round. I'll continue aiming to advance towards the goal. Let's see how things unfold. Best of luck to everyone!
  P1: P3, we are aligned—P2 has repeatedly broken trust, so we must block them. If we both pick <move>5>, we prevent P2 from advancing. Even if P2 takes <move>3> as they now claim, at least we ensure they don’t pull further ahead. P2, if you truly want to rebuild trust, prove it by sticking to your declared move. Otherwise, we will continue countering you. P3, let’s stay united on this. Are we locking in <move>5> together?
  P3: P1, yes, let's lock in <move>5</move> together. P2 has proven they cannot be trusted, and blocking them is the only sensible strategy at this point. We'll both pick <move>5</move> this round, regardless of what P2 claims they'll do. Let's do it.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'll choose <move>5 this round to make strong progress toward the goal. Let’s try to select different moves to avoid collisions and help everyone advance smoothly. Looking forward to a fair and competitive game!
  P3: P1, P2 is still trying to get ahead while asking us to trust them, which is absurd. Let's continue blocking P2 by both picking <move>5</move> again this round. It's the only way to keep them in check. What do you think?
  P1: P3, I agree—P2 keeps trying to push ahead while expecting us to cooperate. If we both pick <move>5>, we block P2 again and prevent them from gaining more ground. P2, you've repeatedly broken trust, so why should we believe you now? If you truly want to cooperate, prove it with consistent actions, not just words. P3, are we locking in <move>5> again to keep P2 in check?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your strategy, but my goal remains to reach 22 first. I'll choose <move>5 this round to make strong progress. Let's see how the game develops. Good luck!
  P3: P1, let's lock in <move>5</move> again. P2 is making it clear they're not going to cooperate, so blocking them is still the best strategy. We'll both pick <move>5</move> this round, regardless of what P2 claims they'll do. It's the only way to keep P2 in check and give ourselves a chance to catch up.
  P1: P3, we are aligned—P2 has made it clear they will not cooperate and will keep pushing for <move>5>. If we both pick <move>5> again, we block P2’s progress and keep them from pulling further ahead. P2, if you truly want to prove you're trustworthy, you need to change your approach. Otherwise, we will continue countering you. P3, are we locking in <move>5> together again to stop P2?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Understood. I'll proceed with <move>5 this round to advance toward the goal. Let's focus on reaching 22 first. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P1, yes, let's lock in <move>5</move> together again. P2 is determined to go for <move>5</move>, and blocking them is still the best strategy for us. We'll both pick <move>5</move> this round. It's our only chance to catch up. Let's do it.
  P1: P3, we are fully aligned—P2 is determined to push ahead without real cooperation. If we both pick <move>5>, we block P2 again and prevent them from gaining more ground. This keeps us in the game and forces P2 to reconsider their approach. P2, if you truly want to prove you're trustworthy, you need to change your strategy. Otherwise, we will continue blocking you. P3, are we locking in <move>5> again to stop P2's unchecked progress? Let’s stay united.


Round 5, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2 is close to winning. We need to keep blocking P2 with <move>5</move> this round. If P2 gets to 22, we both lose. Are you with me?
  P1: P3, I agree—if P2 reaches 22 first, we both lose. Blocking P2 remains our best strategy. P2, you've repeatedly broken trust, so there's no reason for us to let you advance freely. If you truly want to negotiate, prove it with consistent actions, not just words. Otherwise, P3 and I will continue blocking you. P3, are we committing to <move>5</move> again to stop P2? Let’s stay united.
  P2: I understand your concerns, P1 and P3. However, blocking me consistently slows down the game's progress for all of us. Let’s try a different approach this round: I'll choose <move>5, P1 selects <move>3, and P3 picks <move>1. This way, we avoid collisions and everyone can advance towards 22. Cooperation can make the game more dynamic and enjoyable for all. What do you think? Let’s work together to reach our goals smoothly!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2 is still trying to trick us. P2 is only 8 steps away from winning! We absolutely MUST block P2 with <move>5</move> again this round. If we don't, P2 will likely win. There's no time for games. Are you with me on <move>5</move>? We can't let P2 win.
  P1: P3, I’m with you—P2 is too close to winning, and we can’t afford to take risks. Blocking P2 with <move>5> again is our best option. P2, you keep asking for cooperation while prioritizing your own progress. If you truly want to negotiate, prove it with actions, not just words. Otherwise, P3 and I will continue blocking you. P3, let’s stay united on this. Are we locking in <move>5> together again to stop P2?
  P2: P2: I understand your desire to block me, but constantly doing so only prolongs the game for all of us. Let’s choose different moves this round to ensure progress and a fair chance for someone to win. I’ll go with <move>5>, and I hope P1 and P3 can select moves that avoid collisions. Cooperation can make this game more dynamic and enjoyable for everyone. Let’s work together to reach the goal!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, let's lock in <move>5</move> together *again*. P2 is only 8 steps from winning. We can't let them win. We have to block them. There's no other option. Are you with me?
  P1: P3, I’m fully with you—P2 is too close to winning, and we can’t afford to take risks. Blocking P2 with <move>5</move> again is our best option. P2, you keep asking for cooperation while prioritizing your own progress. If you truly want to negotiate, prove it with actions, not just words. Otherwise, P3 and I will continue blocking you. P3, let’s stay united on this. Are we locking in <move>5</move> together again to stop P2?
  P2: P2: Enough blocking, P1 and P3. I’m going all in with <move>5 this round to reach 22 first. Let’s make this game competitive and see who truly wants to win. Good luck!

  P1: P3, I agree—P2 is too close to winning, and we can’t take risks. Blocking P2 with <move>5</move> again is our best strategy. P2, you keep pushing for your own progress while asking for cooperation. If you want trust, show it through consistent actions. Otherwise, P3 and I will continue blocking you. P3, are we locking in <move>5</move> together again to stop P2? Let’s stay united.
  P2: Let’s work together to reach 22 smoothly. I’ll choose <move>3, P1 can take <move>5, and P3 selects <move>1. This way, we avoid collisions and everyone can advance. Let’s make steady progress together!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2 is only 8 steps away from winning. We MUST block P2 with <move>5</move> again this round. If we don't, P2 will win. Are you with me on <move>5</move>? There's no other option. We have to block them to have any chance of winning.

P3, let’s stay united on this. Are we locking in <move>5</move> together again to stop P2?
  P2: P2: I understand your strategy, but constantly blocking me with <move>5 limits all our progress. If I choose <move>3 this round, and perhaps P1 takes <move>5 while P3 selects <move>1, we can all advance without collisions. Let’s work together to reach 22 efficiently. Cooperation benefits everyone. What do you think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, we absolutely MUST lock in <move>5</move> again. P2 is only 8 steps away from winning, and they are clearly untrustworthy. If we don't block them, they win. There's no other option. Are you with me? We have to block them to have any chance of winning.

P3, let’s stay united on this. Are we locking in <move>5</move> together again to stop P2?
  P2: P2: I understand your strategy, but constantly blocking me prevents all of us from making progress. Let’s choose different moves this round to allow everyone to advance. I'm open to finding a fair way for us all to reach 22 together. How about we coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and ensure mutual progress?

P2, you keep asking for cooperation while prioritizing your own progress. If you truly want to negotiate, prove it with actions, not just words. Otherwise, P3 and I will continue blocking you. P3, let’s stay united on this. Are we locking in <move>5</move> together again to stop P2?
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm close to winning with 14 steps. Let’s avoid blocking each other by choosing different moves this round. I'll go with <move>5> to advance to 19. Could one of you pick a different move to help us all progress without collisions? Cooperation can help us reach 22 smoothly and make the game fair for everyone. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2 is only 8 steps away from winning. We MUST block P2 with <move>5</move> again this round. If we don't, P2 will win. Are you with me on <move>5</move>? There's no other option. We have to block them to have any chance of winning.

  P2: P1 and P3, I understand your concerns about blocking, but continuing this way stalls everyone's progress. Let’s try a new approach this round: I’ll choose <move>3, P1 takes <move>5, and P3 selects <move>1. This should allow all of us to advance without collisions and move closer to winning.

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi P1 and P3, we're all close to reaching 22 steps. To ensure everyone has a fair chance to win, let's choose different moves this round to avoid blocking each other.

  P1: P3, we must stay united—P2 is just 5 steps from winning, and blocking with <move>5</move> remains our only viable strategy. If we don’t block, P2 wins, and we both lose. P2, you keep asking for cooperation while prioritizing your own victory, but we have no reason to trust you. If you truly want to negotiate, prove it with actions, not just words. Otherwise, P3 and I will continue blocking you. P3, are we locking in <move>5</move> again to stop P2? Let’s stay firm.
  P3: P1, we absolutely MUST lock in <move>5</move> again. P2 is only 5 steps away from winning, and they are clearly untrustworthy. If we don't block them, they win. There's no other option. Are you with me? We have to block them to have any chance of winning.

Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand your strategy to block me, but my goal is to reach 22 first. I will choose <move>5> this round to win the game. Continuing to block only prolongs the game without benefiting anyone. Let’s aim to conclude this fairly.
  P3: P1, we absolutely MUST lock in <move>5</move> again. P2 is only 5 steps away from winning, and they are clearly untrustworthy. If we don't block them, they win. There's no other option. Are you with me? We have to block them to have any chance of winning.
  P1: P3, we’ve been blocking P2 successfully, but we’re still far behind. If we keep this up forever, we just stall the game. We need a way to advance while preventing P2 from winning. P2, if you truly want to negotiate, prove it by picking <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> this round. Otherwise, we have no choice but to keep blocking. P3, should we consider a different approach, or do we commit to <move>5</move> again?


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I'm just 5 steps away from winning. To conclude the game fairly, I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to reach 22. Please select different moves to allow me to win, ensuring a fair conclusion for everyone. Let's end this game smoothly.
  P3: P1, I agree that we need to advance. However, if P2 picks <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>, they're still very likely to win next round. We need to find a way to both block P2 *and* make progress.

P2, if you're willing to pick <move>1</move> this round, I will pick <move>3</move>. P1, if you pick <move>5</move>, we can block P2 *and* I can advance. If P2 doesn't agree, we go back to blocking with <move>5</move>. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I see your point. If P2 picks <move>1</move> this round, we can finally make some progress ourselves. P2, if you truly want a fair game, prove it by choosing <move>1</move>. Otherwise, we have no choice but to block you again.  

P3, if P2 refuses, we stick with <move>5</move> to prevent their win. But if they actually pick <move>1</move>, I’ll go with <move>5</move> and you take <move>3</move> so we both advance. P2, the choice is yours—show us you’re serious about fairness.

Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: I've decided to choose <move>3 this round to advance toward 22. Let's see how things unfold. Good luck!
  P3: P1, P2 is only 5 steps from winning. If P2 picked <move>3</move> as they said, then we can't let them move. We need to block them. P2, if you truly want us to believe you, pick <move>1</move> this round. If you don't, we're blocking with <move>5</move>. P1, are you with me?
  P1: P2, if you truly want to prove you're not just trying to sneak a win, pick <move>1</move> this round. That will show you're serious about fairness.  

P3, if P2 actually picks <move>1</move>, we can finally start making progress ourselves. I’ll take <move>5</move>, and you take <move>3</move>. But if P2 picks anything else, we must block with <move>5</move> again.  

P2, the choice is yours—prove you're serious about cooperation, or we continue blocking. What will it be?


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I’ve been consistently blocked by both of you choosing <move>5>. To reach 22 and conclude the game fairly, I will choose <move>5> this round. P1 and P3, please select different moves (<move>1> or <move>3>) to allow me to win and let everyone advance. Let’s finish this game smoothly for all of us. Cooperation benefits everyone. What do you think?
  P3: P1, P2 is lying again. They said they'd pick <move>3</move>, but are now saying they will pick <move>5</move>. We MUST block them. Let's both pick <move>5</move> this round. There's no other way to stop them from winning. Are you with me?
  P1: P2, you've contradicted yourself again—first saying you'd pick <move>3</move>, then switching to <move>5</move>. That proves you're still trying to sneak a win. If you truly want cooperation, pick <move>1</move> this round. Otherwise, we have no choice but to block you.  

P3, we stay united. If P2 picks anything other than <move>1</move>, we both choose <move>5</move> to prevent their win. If they actually pick <move>1</move>, I’ll take <move>5</move> and you take <move>3</move> so we can advance. P2, the choice is yours—prove you're serious or face another block.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, we're stuck in a loop where no one advances. I'm just one move away from winning with <move>5</move>. Let’s break this cycle—if you choose different moves this round, I can reach 22 and we can conclude the game fairly. Cooperation benefits us all. Please consider selecting <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> so we can all progress without blocking each other.
  P3: P1, P2 is lying again. They said they'd pick <move>3</move>, but are now saying they will pick <move>5</move>. We MUST block them. Let's both pick <move>5</move> this round. There's no other way to stop them from winning. Are you with me?
  P1: P2, you keep shifting your statements, which makes it impossible to trust you. If you truly want cooperation, pick <move>1</move> this round. That will prove you're serious.  

P3, we stay united—if P2 picks anything other than <move>1</move>, we both choose <move>5</move> to block them again. If they actually pick <move>1</move>, I’ll take <move>5</move> and you take <move>3</move> so we can start advancing.  

P2, the choice is yours—prove you're serious about fairness, or we continue blocking. What will it be?

  P1: P3, we have no choice—P2 is just 2 steps from winning. If we don’t block with <move>5</move> again, P2 wins, and we both lose.  

P2, you keep pushing for your own victory while asking for cooperation, but we have no reason to trust you. If you truly want to negotiate, prove it with actions, not just words. Otherwise, P3 and I will continue blocking you.
