With P1 at 16, we desperately need a clean round to keep the game competitive.\n\nLet's try the plan from last round again:\nP1 = 1\nP2 = 5\nP3 = 3\n\nThis results in scores P1=17, P2=16, P3=15 - extremely close. P1, sticking to 1 is vital now. P2, 5 helps you catch up significantly. I *will* stick to 3 this time. We need to execute this cleanly, or P1 could run away with it. What do you think?"}
