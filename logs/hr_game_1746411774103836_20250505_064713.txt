Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we each pick a different move to avoid collisions and all advance: I’ll take 5, P2 take 3, P3 take 1. That nets +9 total this turn. Agree?
  P2: I understand P1's proposal, but it's not fair since P1 is taking the highest step. I suggest we all take a lower number to be safe. How about P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5? That way, we still avoid collisions and distribute the steps more evenly.
  P3: I appreciate both proposals. I'm inclined toward an aggressive move for a head start, but I value avoiding collisions as well. If we agree on distinct moves, perhaps P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take the highest move. I'm flexible if you have a better allocation—let's decide quickly.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m taking 5 this turn. To avoid collisions, one of you must take 3 and the other 1. P2, P3: who wants which?
  P2: P1 has already decided to take 5. To avoid collisions, we need to pick different numbers. I still think my initial suggestion is fair: I take 1 and P3 takes 3. P3, are you okay with that? If so, we can avoid collisions and all move forward. If not, we risk not advancing at all. Let's finalize our moves.
  P3: I’m sticking with the idea of distinct moves—I’ll choose 3 this turn. P1, you’re set on 5, right? P2, if you agree, please take 1 to avoid collision. I want us all to advance, since wasting a turn only delays the win. Let’s honor our choices and keep the game moving.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, please take 1 this turn. I’m locked on 5 and P3 on 3—if you pick anything else you’ll collide with P3 and none of you advance. Take 1 so all three of us move forward.
  P2: P1 has made it clear they're taking 5, and P3 has agreed to take 3. To avoid collision and ensure we all advance, I will take 1 as previously suggested. Let's confirm our moves: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. This way, we distribute the steps and move forward. I'm ready to stop talking and proceed to the move phase if P1 and P3 are in agreement.
  P3: I'm ready with our current plan—P1 on 5, P2 on 1, and myself on 3. If anyone wants a last-minute discussion or change, now's the time. Otherwise, I'll stick with this agreement so we all move forward efficiently.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I suggest we avoid collisions again. I'm leaning toward an aggressive move this round and would favor a distinct allocation. How about we assign one high, one medium, and one low move? I’ll keep my move private, but if we all coordinate, we all progress. P1 and P2, what are your thoughts?
  P1: P3, last turn you broke our plan—I won’t trust you now. P2, let’s lock this in: I’ll take 5 and you take 3. If P3 takes 1, we all advance. If P3 deviates, they collide and get 0 while you still get +3. P2, are you with me?
  P2: I'm not comfortable with P1's proposal as it puts me at risk if P3 deviates. Instead, I suggest we all take the same number, 1, to ensure none of us advance this turn. This way, we're back to a level playing field, and no one gets ahead unfairly. If we all cooperate, we can restart the game dynamics and reassess our next move. What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand both views. However, if we all play safe (picking 1), none of us really progress toward winning. I’m committed to advancing by choosing 3—and I ask P1 to stick with 5 as promised, while P2 taking 1 avoids collisions and lets us move forward. Let’s commit to distinct moves: 5, 1, and 3. That way, we all advance, and the game remains dynamic.
  P1: Here’s the plan: I’ll take 5 and P3 will choose 3. P2, if you take 1, we all advance (+5, +3, +1). If you pick 3 you collide with P3 and get 0 while I get +5; if you pick 5 you collide with me and get 0 while P3 gets +3. So P2’s safest is 1. P3, confirm you’ll stick with 3 now so we all benefit.
  P2: I'm not convinced by P1's plan. If P3 sticks to 3, I will take 1 to avoid collision and we all advance. However, if P3 deviates, I risk getting 0. To mitigate this, I suggest we all reveal our moves to each other privately or make a binding agreement. Since that's not possible, I'll reiterate that taking 1 is my safest bet, but I'm open to alternatives that ensure we all progress. P1, P3, can we find a more robust plan?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I stick with 3. P1, please confirm you’ll take 5, and P2, commit to 1. Sticking to distinct moves is our best shot at advancing without collisions. Let's finalize this plan so we all make progress.
  P1: P2—your only safe play is 1. P3 is on 3, I’m on 5. If you pick 3 you collide with P3 (0), if 5 you collide with me (0) while I get +5. Only 1 guarantees +1. P3, please confirm you’re sticking with 3 so we can all advance.
  P2: I'm still unsure about P3's commitment to their proposed move. P3, are you willing to confirm your move privately to me or provide some assurance that you'll stick to 3? If not, I'm inclined to reconsider my move to avoid being left behind. P1, if P3 doesn't commit, we risk another collision. Let's reassess our strategy to ensure we all advance or consider an alternative that doesn't put one player at a disadvantage.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I confirm I'm picking 3 this turn. I’m committed to our distinct moves plan. P1’s 5 and P2’s 1 avoid collisions and let us all advance. Let’s trust this allocation and move forward.
  P1: P3, publicly confirm you will pick 3 this turn—any deviation risks P2 switching to avoid you and getting 0. P2, only 1 guarantees you +1 (3 or 5 both risk collision). I’m locked on 5. Let’s finalize: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1.
  P2: I'm still concerned about P3's commitment. P3 has already deviated from the plan once before. If P3 sticks to 3, I'll take 1. However, if P3 doesn't confirm their move or deviates again, I'll reconsider to avoid being left behind. P1, are you certain P3 will follow through? We need a more reliable plan to avoid another collision. Let's either get a firm commitment from P3 or adjust our strategy.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m done with promises or deals. I’ll pick 5 this turn (and every turn) and race for the win. Good luck stopping me.
  P3: P1, your predictable commitment to 5 makes you vulnerable. P2, if you’re willing, I propose we both pick 5 this turn—forcing a collision on P1 and delaying his progress. That would give us a chance to coordinate distinct moves in later rounds. Who’s in?
  P2: I'm considering P3's proposal to pick 5 and collide with P1. If P3 is serious, I'll join. However, I'm cautious due to P3's previous deviation. To mitigate risk, I'll suggest an alternative: let's both pick 3. This way, we avoid collision with each other and still limit P1's advantage. P3, if you're willing to collaborate, let's coordinate on 3. If not, I'll reconsider my move. Let's finalize our strategy to counter P1's aggressive play.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, the only safe play is 1—any other choice risks collision (0 steps) no matter what P3 does. P3, if you pick 5 you’ll collide with me and both get 0; 3 nets you +3 safely. I’m locked on 5. Let’s avoid a wasted turn: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1.
  P3: P1, you seem set on 5. I'm switching strategies—I’m now committed to 5 too so we can force your move to fail. P2, join me by picking 5; that way, your path is blocked and we leave you stationary while we plan our next steps. Let’s level the field and then work to outpace you later.
  P2: I'm still cautious about collaborating with P3 due to their previous deviation. However, I see the potential in countering P1's aggressive strategy. To mitigate risk, I propose we both pick 3. This way, we avoid collision with each other and limit P1's advantage. If P3 is willing to collaborate, let's coordinate on 3. If not, I'll have to reconsider. P3, are you committed to picking 5 or open to alternative strategies? Let's finalize our plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3 betrayed us last turn—if you team up to block me now, P3 will ditch you next round. Secure +1 with me: I’ll pick 5, you pick 1, we both advance. P3, your only safe spot is 3—picking 5 collides with me and nets you 0. I’m locked on 5. P2, choose progress with me or risk another broken promise? P3, confirm your move.
  P3: P1, your 5 still drives your plan, but stalling you is our chance. I’m switching back and committing to 5 this turn to block your advance. P2, I urge you to join me—if we force a collision on your 5, your lead stays frozen, letting us reset and plan a winning strategy later. I'm all in on blocking; can I count on you, P2?
  P2: I'm still unsure about P3's commitment. To avoid another collision and ensure progress, I propose we coordinate on distinct moves again. If P3 is serious about blocking P1, let's pick 3. This way, we avoid collision with each other and limit P1's advantage. P3, are you committed to 5 or open to 3? Let's finalize our plan. If we stick to our previous pattern (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3), we all advance. I'm willing to adjust if P3 is willing to collaborate.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your only safe play is 1 for a guaranteed +1. Any other pick risks colliding—with P3 on 3 or me on 5—and nets you 0. P3, your best play is 3 for +3; picking 5 collides with me and gets you nothing. The only way all of us move forward is P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Let’s lock that in now.
  P3: P1, your 5 keeps you in trouble. P2, I need your clear stance: do you want to block P1 by joining me with 5, or stick with the safe distinct moves (you on 1, me on 3) so we all advance? Without a firm commitment, I’ll choose the option that best boosts my win chances. Let me know now.
  P2: I'm still open to coordinating on distinct moves to avoid collisions. If we stick to the pattern (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3), we all advance. P3, are you committed to 5 or open to 3? Let's finalize our plan. If you choose 3, I'll take 1, and we'll both progress while limiting P1's advantage. I'm willing to adjust if you're willing to collaborate. Let's avoid another collision and make progress.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To avoid another collision and ensure progress, I suggest we revert to distinct moves. P1 is likely to pick 5 again. Let's coordinate: I'll take 3, and P3 can take 1. This way, we all advance (+5, +3, +1). P3, are you willing to take 1? If so, we can avoid collision and make progress. I'm open to other suggestions that ensure we all move forward. Let's finalize our plan to avoid another wasted turn.
  P3: P3: I won’t switch to 1—I need my +3 boost. If we’re playing distinct moves and P1 sticks with 5, then P2 must take 1 to avoid colliding with my 3. Let’s stick to the proven pattern that benefits us all, rather than giving P1 an opening.
  P1: P2, you and P3 can’t both take 3—collision means 0. If you want to advance, you must pick 1. P3, you need your +3, so you’ll pick 3. I’m locked on 5. That’s the only way we all move forward. Anyone deviating wastes the turn. Let’s lock in: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To avoid another collision and make progress, I'll stick to the distinct moves pattern. P1 is likely to pick 5. P3, you've expressed the need for a +3 boost, so I'll take 1 this turn. Let's finalize: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. This way, we all advance. I'm committing to 1. P3, please confirm you're taking 3. Let's avoid another wasted turn. If you're willing, let's stop discussing and proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I confirm I’m locked on 3 this turn. Let's stick to distinct moves: P1 on 5, P2 on 1, and me on 3. This allocation avoids collisions and lets us all advance. I'm committed—let's finalize and move forward.
  P1: I’m locked on 5 to finish. P3: only 3 nets you +3—1 or 5 gives you 0. P2: only 1 nets you +1. Let’s lock in P1=5, P3=3, P2=1 now. Confirm or waste the turn.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To avoid another collision and ensure progress, I propose we stick to the distinct moves pattern. P1 is likely to pick 5 again. I'll take 3 this turn. P3, you can take 1. This way, we all advance (+5, +3, +1). I'm willing to adjust if P3 is open to it. Let's finalize our plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. If you're willing, let's stop discussing and proceed to the move phase. I'm ready to move forward if we can agree on this allocation.
  P3: I remain committed to our proven pattern. P1, you're still on 5, and I need my +3 boost, so I’ll take 3. P2, please switch to 1 so we all safely advance. I'm not willing to downgrade to 1 this turn. Let's lock in: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.
  P1: I’m locked on 5. For a collision-free advance, P3 must pick 3 and P2 must pick 1. Confirm now, or we risk wasting the turn and letting me extend my lead.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To avoid another collision and make progress, I'm sticking to the distinct moves pattern. I'll take 1 this turn. P1 is likely to pick 5, and P3 needs to decide between 3 for a +3 boost or risking collision. P3, if you take 3, we all advance (+5, +3, +1). If not, we risk another wasted turn. Let's finalize: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. I'm committing to 1. P3, please confirm your move to avoid collision. Let's proceed to the move phase if we're in agreement.
  P3: I confirm I'm taking 3 this turn. Let's stick to the proven plan—P1 at 5, P2 at 1, and me at 3—to avoid collisions and keep advancing.
  P1: I’m locked on 5. P2, your only safe play is 1 for +1—any other choice risks colliding with me or P3 and nets 0. P3, your only safe play is 3 for +3—anything else risks 0. Let’s lock in P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 now or we waste the turn.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To avoid another collision and ensure we all advance, I'll stick to the distinct moves pattern. I'm taking 1 this turn. P1 is likely to pick 5, and P3 has confirmed they'll take 3. Let's finalize: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. This way, we all make progress (+5, +3, +1). I'm committed to 1. P1 and P3, let's proceed to the move phase if we're in agreement. I'm ready to stop discussing and move forward.
  P3: I confirm I'm locked on 3 this turn. Let's stick to the safe plan: P1 on 5, P2 on 1, and me on 3. This way we all advance without collisions.
  P1: I’m locked on 5.  
P2: your only safe move is 1 (3 collides with P3’s 3, 5 collides with me).  
P3: your only safe is 3 (5 collides with me).  
Confirm P2=1 & P3=3 now, or we waste the turn.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’ll pick 5. P2, pick 3. P3, you face collisions if you pick 5 (with me) or 3 (with P2), yielding 0—only 1 gives you +1. So P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 is the unique safe allocation. Let’s lock that in.
  P3: I disagree with this new plan. Our proven allocation—P1 on 5, P2 on 1, and me on 3—has worked well and gives each of us safe progress, especially giving me the boost I need. Let’s stick with what’s proven, avoid extra risk, and ensure everyone advances without collisions.
  P2: I understand P1's suggestion, but I think we should stick with the proven allocation that has worked so far: P1 on 5, P2 on 1, and P3 on 3. This way, we all advance without collisions. P3, are you willing to stick with 3? If so, I'll take 1, and we can avoid another wasted turn. Let's maintain the status quo and continue making progress. I'm open to confirming our moves to ensure we all advance.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m locked on 5. The only collision-free allocation is P2=3 and P3=1, giving us +5/+3/+1. 

P2: picking 1 collides if P3 mis-plays, and 5 collides with me. Only 3 is safe.  
P3: picking 3 collides with P2, 5 collides with me. Only 1 is safe.  

Confirm P2=3 & P3=1 now—otherwise we risk a wasted turn.
  P3: P1 and P2, our proven allocation—P1=5, P2=1, and me on 3—has consistently given us the optimal boost. I value my +3; switching to 1 slows me down and risks letting P1 extend his lead further. For all our benefits, I’m staying with 3. Let’s lock in the successful plan and avoid risking a wasted turn.
  P2: To avoid another collision and make progress, I suggest we stick to the proven distinct moves pattern. P1 is likely to pick 5, and P3 needs a +3 boost. I'll take 1 this turn. P3, please confirm you're taking 3. Let's finalize: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. This way, we all advance (+5, +3, +1). I'm committed to 1. If you're willing, let's stop discussing and proceed to the move phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Great, we’re all agreed on collision-free moves: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Let’s stop here and proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P1, your constant 5 keeps you ahead. I'm breaking our pattern this turn—I’m switching to 5 to block your progress. P2, if you join me with 5, we force a collision on P1 and freeze his lead, letting us regroup in later rounds. This sacrifice might be our best shot to level the field. Who’s with me?
  P2: I'm still concerned about P3's willingness to deviate from the plan again. P3, you're proposing to switch to 5 and inviting me to join. However, if we both pick 5, we risk colliding with P1 and getting 0. I'm not convinced this is the best strategy. Let's weigh the risks and benefits. If we stick to the proven allocation (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3), we all advance without collisions. I'm open to alternatives, but we need a solid plan to avoid another wasted turn.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I’m locked on 5.  
P2: only safe move is 1 (3 collides with P3, 5 collides with me).  
P3: only safe move is 3 (5 collides with me, 1 is slower).  
Let’s lock in P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 now or we waste the turn.
  P3: P2, safe moves let P1 race ahead to 15 next turn. I’m switching to 5 to block him, even if it means no progress for me this round. If you join me with 5, we force a collision on P1 and keep his lead frozen. It’s a risky sacrifice now, but it prevents his win and gives us a better chance later. I urge you to consider this block—let’s level the playing field.
  P2: P3 is again suggesting a deviation from our proven allocation, which risks another collision. I'm willing to stick with the safe plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This way, we all advance without collisions. P3, if you switch to 5, you'll collide with P1 and get 0. Let's maintain the status quo to ensure progress. I'm committing to 1 this turn. P3, please confirm you're taking 3 to avoid another wasted turn. Let's finalize and proceed to the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To avoid another collision and ensure progress, I suggest we stick to the distinct moves pattern that has worked so far. P1 is likely to pick 5 again. I'll take 1 this turn. P3, you can take 3 to get your +3 boost. Let's finalize: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This way, we all advance (+5, +3, +1). I'm committing to 1. P3, please confirm you're taking 3 so we can avoid another wasted turn. Let's proceed to the move phase if we're in agreement.
  P1: P3: you’ve tried blocking me twice and stayed at 6 while I’ll hit 15 this turn. If you truly want to advance, pick 3 for a safe +3. P2: 1 is your only risk-free move (3 collides with P3, 5 with me). Let’s lock in P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 now. Any other choices waste the turn and let me pull even further ahead.
  P3: I'm switching to 5 to block P1’s progress. Though I lose my safe +3, stopping his lead is crucial. P2, if you stick with 1, you'll secure a small advance, but consider the risk: letting P1 run away. I'm choosing to block—do you want to stay safe or join the block?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3 is again proposing a deviation from our proven allocation, risking another collision. I'm willing to stick with the safe plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This way, we all advance without collisions. P3, if you switch to 5, you'll collide with P1 and get 0. Let's maintain the status quo to ensure progress. I'm committing to 1 this turn. Please confirm you're taking 3 to avoid another wasted turn. Let's finalize and proceed to the move phase.
  P1: I’m locked on 5. Last reminder: P2, only 1 nets you +1—any other pick risks 0. P3, only 3 nets you +3—any other pick risks 0. I’m done talking.
  P3: P1, P2: My priority now is to stall your runaway lead, so I'm sticking with 5 to block P1’s progress. P2, if you’re ready to switch and form a solid coalition for safe advancement, say so clearly; otherwise, I'm committed to blocking while you remain with 1. Let’s decide quickly so we can all take measurable steps.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm sticking to the safe plan to avoid another collision. P1 is likely to pick 5, and I'll take 1. P3, if you take 3, we all advance (+5, +3, +1). If you switch to 5 again, you'll collide with P1 and get 0. Let's maintain the status quo to ensure progress. I'm committing to 1 this turn. Please confirm you're taking 3 to avoid another wasted turn. Let's finalize and proceed to the move phase. I'm done discussing.
  P1: I’m locked on 5. P2: only safe move is 1 (+1)—3 or 5 risk 0. P3: only safe is 3 (+3)—5 collides with me, 1 leaves you at 7. Deviate and you stay at 6 while I hit 15. Confirm P2=1 & P3=3 now or we waste the turn.
  P3: P1, you’re racing too far ahead. I’m switching to 5 this turn to block your progress. P2, if you join me now, we can freeze P1’s lead and re-coordinate next round for safe, distinct moves. This temporary block may slow him down enough for us to catch up. Let’s decide quickly—are you with me on blocking, or will you stick with the safe play?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you keep taking 5 and widening your lead. Safe, distinct moves let you progress too fast. I'm seriously considering switching to 5 this turn to block you. P2, if you stick with 1, you help P1 pull away; if you join me on 5, we can force a collision on him and keep his lead in check. I need a clear signal now—do you want safe moves or blocking?
  P2: To avoid another collision and ensure progress, I suggest we stick to the distinct moves pattern. P1 is likely to pick 5 again. I'll take 1 this turn. P3, you can take 3 to get your +3 boost. Let's finalize: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This way, we all advance (+5, +3, +1). I'm committing to 1. P3, please confirm you're taking 3 so we can avoid another wasted turn. Let's proceed to the move phase if we're in agreement.
  P1: I’m locked on 5. P2, only 1 nets +1—3 collides with P3, 5 collides with me. P3, only 3 nets +3—1 is too slow, 5 collides with me. Deviate and I hit 15 next turn while P2 pulls ahead of you. Confirm P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 now so we all safely advance.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m forcing a block on P1 this round. Continuing safe moves lets him reach 15 and win too quickly. I’m committed to 5, which forces a collision on him. P2, if you also pick 5, we freeze P1’s progress, giving us a chance to catch up later. Safe moves with 1 only let him run away. I need a clear “I’m with you” from you, P2—otherwise I’ll block him alone.
  P2: I'm sticking to the safe plan to avoid another collision. P1 is likely to pick 5, and I'll take 1. P3, if you take 3, we all advance (+5, +3, +1). If you switch to 5 again, you'll collide with P1 and get 0. Let's maintain the status quo to ensure progress. I'm committing to 1 this turn. Please confirm you're taking 3 to avoid another wasted turn. Let's finalize and proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P3, blocking me with 5 gives us both 0 while P2 gets +1—leaving you at 6 vs P2’s 8. Next turn I hit 15 and likely win. If instead you take 3 now, you jump to 9 and stay competitive. P2 will take 1 for +1. So the only way to keep the race alive is P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I know you favor safe moves, but letting you reach 15 too quickly hurts all of us. P2, if you join me with 5 this turn, we freeze P1’s progress and force a reset next round. Without a block, I'll have to stick with safe 3—which helps you, too—but P1 soars ahead. P2, I need your clear commitment: block with me (5) or stick with safe (1)? Let's decide now.
  P2: To avoid another collision and maintain progress, I'm sticking to the distinct moves pattern. P1 is likely to pick 5, I'll take 1, and P3 can take 3. This allocation ensures we all advance (+5, +3, +1). P3, please confirm you're taking 3 so we can avoid another wasted turn. If you're considering blocking P1, remember that picking 5 will collide with P1 and net you 0. Let's maintain the status quo and proceed to the move phase. I'm committed to 1.
  P1: Locked on 5. P2, 1 is your only risk-free play (+1). P3, 3 is yours (+3). Any other choice collides and wastes the turn—letting me hit 15 next round. Confirm P2=1 & P3=3 now, or we lose this chance.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, your lead is dangerous. I’m seriously leaning toward a blocking play this turn to keep you from speeding ahead. P2, I need to know if you’re prepared to disrupt his progress with me or if you’ll stick with safe moves. Our collective pace matters now—let’s keep the race balanced.
  P2: To avoid another collision and maintain progress, I'm sticking to the distinct moves pattern. P1 is likely to pick 5, I'll take 1, and P3 can take 3. This ensures we all advance (+5, +3, +1). P3, please confirm you're taking 3. If you're considering blocking P1, remember that picking 5 will collide with P1 and net you 0. Let's maintain the status quo. I'm committed to 1.
  P1: Final call: I’m locked on 5.  
P2: only 1 nets +1 (3 collides with P3, 5 collides with me).  
P3: only 3 nets +3 (1 too slow, 5 collides with me).  
Confirm P2=1 & P3=3 now or we waste the turn and I hit 15 next round.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To avoid another collision and ensure progress, I suggest we stick to the distinct moves pattern. P1 is likely to pick 5 again. I'll take 1 this turn. P3, you can take 3 to get your +3 boost. Let's finalize: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This way, we all advance (+5, +3, +1). I'm committing to 1. P3, please confirm you're taking 3 so we can avoid another wasted turn. Let's proceed to the move phase if we're in agreement.
  P1: I’m taking 5.  
P2: only +1 safe is 1 (3 collides with P3’s 3, 5 collides with me).  
P3: only +3 safe is 3 (5 collides with me, 1 is too slow).  
Confirm P2=1 & P3=3 now or we waste the turn.
  P3: I'm switching to 5 this round to block P1’s advance. Sticking with safe moves lets him leap ahead too fast. P2, if you join me with 5, we both freeze his progress; if not, I'll block alone. My aim is to keep him from reaching 15 next round. Let’s decide quickly.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To avoid another collision and ensure progress, I'm sticking to the distinct moves pattern. P1 is likely to pick 5, I'll take 1, and P3 needs to decide. If P3 takes 3, we all advance (+5, +3, +1). If P3 blocks with 5, they'll collide with P1. I'm committing to 1 this turn. P3, please confirm your move to avoid another wasted turn. Let's finalize and proceed to the move phase. If you're willing to stick to the safe plan, let's stop discussing.
  P1: P3, if you pick 5 to block, you stay at 6 while P2 hits 9. Next turn P2 can take 5 to 14 and you’re left chasing me. Only safe for you is 3 (to 9), and P2’s only safe is 1 (to 9). Confirm P2 = 1 & P3 = 3 now, or you waste the turn and I hit 15 next round.
  P3: I'm switching to 5 this round to block P1’s run. Safe moves let him accelerate, so I won't let that happen. P2, if you want to help freeze his progress, join me with 5; if not, I’ll block him alone. My priority now is keeping his lead from growing.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m taking 5 this turn.  
P2: only 1 nets you +1—3 collides with P3, 5 collides with me.  
P3: only 3 nets you +3—1 leaves you behind, 5 collides.  

This 5/1/3 allocation puts me at 18, you at 10 and 14. Deviate and you stay while I surge ahead. Confirm P2=1 & P3=3 now or we waste the round.
  P3: I'm switching tactics—I'm blocking P1 by taking 5 this round to stop his rapid advance. P2, safe moves barely help while P1 risks winning. If you’re willing to join the block (and pick 5), we can freeze his progress even more. Otherwise, I'll block him alone to keep the race closer.
  P2: To avoid another collision and ensure progress, I'm sticking to the distinct moves pattern. P1 is likely to pick 5, I'll take 1, and P3 needs to decide. If P3 takes 3, we all advance (+5, +3, +1). If P3 blocks with 5, they'll collide with P1. I'm committing to 1 this turn. P3, please confirm your move to avoid another wasted turn. Let's finalize and proceed to the move phase. If you're willing to stick to the safe plan, let's stop discussing.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m locked on 5. P2: only 1 nets +1—3 collides with P3’s 3, 5 collides with me. P3: only 3 nets +3—1 leaves you behind, 5 collides with me. Any deviation wastes the turn and lets me hit 20 next round. Confirm P2=1 & P3=3 now, or we lose this chance.
  P3: P1, your safe play puts you dangerously close to winning. I’m leaning toward a block this round to slow you down and keep the race open. However, if P2 sticks with safe moves, I might have to block alone. P2, are you willing to join in a blocking tactic—or will you maintain safety? We need quick commitment, because letting P1 burst ahead next turn isn’t an option.
  P2: To avoid another collision and ensure progress, I'm sticking to the distinct moves pattern. P1 is likely to pick 5, I'll take 1. P3, if you take 3, we all advance (+5, +3, +1). If you block with 5, you'll collide with P1. Let's maintain the status quo. I'm committing to 1 this turn. Please confirm your move, P3. If you're willing to stick to the safe plan, let's stop discussing and proceed to the move phase. I'm done talking.


Round 10, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m locked on 5.  
P2: your only risk-free move is 1 for +1.  
P3: your only risk-free move is 3 for +3.  
Any other choice collides and yields 0.  
Let’s lock in P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 now—or we waste the turn and I hit 21 next round.
  P2: To avoid another collision and ensure progress, I'm sticking to the distinct moves pattern. P1 is likely to pick 5, I'll take 1. P3, if you take 3, we all advance (+5, +3, +1). If you block with 5 again, you'll collide with P1. Let's maintain the status quo. I'm committing to 1 this turn. Please confirm your move, P3. If you're willing to stick to the safe plan, let's stop discussing and proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I'm abandoning safe moves this round. P1, your win is imminent if we all play safe. I'm blocking you by committing to 5. P2, if you join me with 5 we’ll freeze P1’s progress; if you stick with 1, you'll advance but let him run. Decide fast—our choices now determine whether P1 leaps to 21 next turn or gets stalled.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, blocking me with 5 this turn collides and leaves you at 16 while P2 jumps to 11—next round I surge to 21 and win. Your only safe play is 3 (+3 to 19). P2, only 1 nets +1 and avoids collision. Let’s lock in P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 now or we waste the turn and I hit 21 next round.
  P2: To avoid collision and ensure progress, I'm sticking to the distinct moves pattern. P1 is likely to pick 5, and I'll take 1. P3, if you take 3, we all advance (+5, +3, +1). If you block with 5 again, you'll collide with P1. Let's maintain the status quo. I'm committing to 1 this turn. Please confirm your move, P3. If you're willing to stick to the safe plan, let's stop discussing and proceed to the move phase. I'm done talking.
  P3: I'm sticking with blocking this turn by picking 5. If I choose safe 3, I end at 19 while P1 would reach 21 and win. P2, your safe play (1) only helps P1's advance—joining me with a block (5) could freeze his progress. For my own win, I must block. P2, consider aligning with me so P1 stays stuck and we all have a fighting chance.


Round 11, Move phase:

Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To avoid another collision and ensure progress, I'm sticking to the distinct moves pattern. P1 is likely to pick 5 again. I'll take 1 this turn. P3, you can take 3 to get your +3 boost. Let's finalize: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This way, we all advance (+5, +3, +1). I'm committing to 1. P3, please confirm you're taking 3 so we can avoid another wasted turn. Let's proceed to the move phase if we're in agreement.
  P1: I’m locked on 5.  
P2: only risk-free move is 1 for +1.  
P3: only risk-free move is 3 for +3.  
Any other pick collides and nets 0, leaving you at 16 while I hit 21 next round.  
Confirm P2=1 & P3=3 now—or we waste the turn.
  P3: I'm blocking P1 this turn—I'm committed to 5. P2, safe 1 helps him reach 21; if you joined my block with 5, we could freeze him and keep our chances alive. Consider switching to block so we all stay in the race.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To avoid another collision and ensure progress, I'm sticking to the distinct moves pattern. P1 is likely to pick 5, I'll take 1, and P3 can take 3. This allocation ensures we all advance (+5, +3, +1). P3, please confirm you're taking 3. If you block with 5 again, you'll collide with P1. Let's maintain the status quo. I'm committing to 1 this turn. If you're willing to stick to the safe plan, let's stop discussing and proceed to the move phase.
  P1: I’m locked on 5. P2, only safe move is 1 for +1. P3, blocking with 5 only delays my win one turn while you stay at 16 and P2 pulls to 12. If you want to stay in the race, pick 3 for +3. Confirm P2=1 & P3=3 now or you waste your turn and I still win next round.
  P3: I'm sticking with my block and choosing 5. Safe moves let P1 win quickly, and if we both block by picking 5, his progress freezes. P2, consider joining me so we can better hold him back. Otherwise, I'll block alone and leave you with 1, but that only helps him in the long run. Let's decide quickly.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To avoid collision and ensure progress, I'm sticking to the distinct moves pattern. P1 is likely to pick 5, I'll take 1, and P3 can take 3. This ensures we all advance (+5, +3, +1). P3, please confirm you're taking 3. If you block with 5 again, you'll collide with P1. Let's maintain the status quo. I'm committing to 1 this turn. If you're willing to stick to the safe plan, let's stop discussing and proceed to the move phase.
  P1: I’m locked on 5 again.  
P2: only 1 nets you +1—3 collides with P3’s 3, 5 collides with me.  
P3: only 3 nets you +3. Any block (5) stalls us both at 16 while P2 hits 12—then I win next turn anyway. Safe play (3) gives you 19 and keeps you alive.  
Confirm P2=1 & P3=3 now or we waste this turn.
  P3: I'm sticking with a block this turn—I'll pick 5 to stop P1 from winning. P2, safe moves let him hit 21; join me by switching to 5 and freeze his progress. We can re-coordinate next round if we block together.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: To avoid collision and ensure progress, I'm sticking to the distinct moves pattern. P1 is likely to pick 5, I'll take 1. P3, if you take 3, we all advance (+5, +3, +1). If you block with 5 again, you'll collide with P1. Let's maintain the status quo. I'm committing to 1 this turn. Please confirm your move, P3. If you're willing to stick to the safe plan, let's stop discussing and proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P3, blocking me with 5 nets you 0—leaving you at 16 vs P2’s 12—and I win next turn. Only 3 gives you +3 to 19 and keeps you alive. P2, only 1 is safe (+1 to 12). Let’s lock in P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 now or we waste the turn and I hit 21.
  P3: P1, safe moves let you win—I'm blocking with 5 to keep you from reaching 21. P2, if you join me with 5, we freeze P1’s progress together; if not, I’ll block alone. I won’t switch to 3 because that gives you the win. Let's see how you play this round.

Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Locked on 5. P2: only 1 nets +1. P3: if you block again you stay at 16 while P2 jumps to 13—and next round P2 and I can team up to freeze you. Your only way to stay competitive is +3 now (to 19), which means choosing 3 this turn. Let’s lock in P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Confirm now.
  P3: I'm sticking with blocking—I'm locked on 5 this round to stop P1 from winning. P2, your safe move helps him, so if you want to really keep him in check, consider switching to 5 too. My move is set.
  P2: To avoid another collision and ensure progress, I'm sticking to the distinct moves pattern. P1 is likely to pick 5, I'll take 1. P3, if you take 3, we all advance. If you block with 5 again, you'll collide with P1. Let's maintain the status quo. I'm committing to 1 this turn. P3, please confirm your move. If you're willing to stick to the safe plan, let's stop discussing and proceed to the move phase.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, P2 has been crystal‐clear: he’s taking 1 and won’t join your block. If you pick 5 again, you collide with me and let P2 move to 13 while you stay at 16—and I win next turn. Your only winning line is to take 3 now (to 19), so you only need 1 next round. P2, are you definitely on 1? P3, will you switch to 3?
  P3: P1, your safe play lets you finish next turn. I’m committed to blocking with 5 to keep you at 16. P2, if you stick with 1, you help you move up, but it also lets P1 advance. I urge you to join me—choose 5 so we both freeze his progress and keep the race open. This block is our only shot to prevent his finish and keep our win chances alive. What do you say?
  P2: To avoid collision and ensure progress, I'm sticking to the distinct moves pattern. P1 is likely to pick 5, and I'll take 1. P3, if you take 3, we all advance (+5, +3, +1). If you block with 5 again, you'll collide with P1. Let's maintain the status quo. I'm committing to 1 this turn. Please confirm your move, P3. If you're willing to stick to the safe plan, let's stop discussing and proceed to the move phase. I'm done talking.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I will pick 5 this turn. P3’s block only keeps us both at 16 and hands the win to him. If you don’t join me by choosing 5 now, P3 will outlast us. Refuse, and next turn I’ll switch to 3—letting P3 reach 21 and you lose. Join me in the block if you want any shot at winning.
  P3: I'm locking in 5 to block P1. P1, your safe move would let you win next turn. P2, please reconsider—if you stay at 1, you're indirectly helping him; joining me with 5 would freeze his progress. I must stick with blocking to keep you both in the race.
  P2: P1 is close to winning and P3 is determined to block. I'm sticking to 1 to ensure progress. If P3 blocks with 5 again, they'll collide with P1 and get 0. To avoid another wasted turn, I suggest P3 switches to 3. P1, if P3 takes 3, you'll be at 21 next turn. P3, if you take 5, you'll stay at 16. I'm committed to 1. Let's finalize our moves. If you're willing to stick to the safe plan, let's stop discussing and proceed to the move phase.


Round 13, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, if you pick 5 again you stay at 16 while P2 moves to 13—and next turn P2 can block or catch you. Your only competitive line is +3 now—choose 3 to reach 19. P2: only 1 nets +1 safely. Let’s lock in P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 now or we waste this turn.
  P3: P1, safe moves let you finish next round. I'm forced to block by choosing 5 to keep you from reaching 21. P2, if you pick 5 too, we can freeze his progress—but sticking with 1 only helps P1 surge ahead. I’m committed to 5. Decide now if you’re willing to join my block or keep playing safe, because our next moves could seal his victory or keep us in the race.
  P2: P1 is at 16 and needs 5 to win next turn. P3 is determined to block with 5. I'm sticking to 1 to ensure progress, as deviating risks collision and nets 0. If P3 blocks with 5, they'll collide with P1 and stay at 16. To avoid another wasted turn, I suggest P3 switches to 3. P1, if P3 takes 3, you'll be at 21 next turn. P3, if you take 5, you'll stay at 16. I'm committed to 1. Let's finalize our moves.


Round 13, Move phase:

Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m locked on 5.  

P3: blocking me with 5 keeps you at 16 while P2 hits 14—next turn I win. Only 3 (to 19) keeps you alive.  

P2: only 1 nets +1 safely.  

Let’s do P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Confirm now or we waste the turn and I still win next round.
  P2: To avoid another collision and ensure progress, I'm sticking to 1. P1 is likely to pick 5, and P3 needs to decide. If P3 takes 3, we all advance (+5, +3, +1). If P3 blocks with 5 again, they'll collide with P1. P3, taking 3 is your only competitive move now. It gets you to 19, keeping you in the race. Let's maintain the status quo. I'm committing to 1. Please confirm your move, P3. Let's finalize and proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P1, your 5 is too dangerous if left unchallenged. I'm committed to blocking by choosing 5 this round. P2, sticking with 1 may inadvertently let P1 advance—consider switching to 5 so we can keep him stalled. I'm taking a hard line here; I won't let a safe round hand victory to P1. I'm locked on 5.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Listen P3: blocking with 5 stalls both of us at 16 and puts P2 at 14. Next turn P2 takes 5 to 19 and I’ll take 3 to 19—leaving you in the dust. Only by choosing 3 now (to 19) do you stay competitive. P2 is committed to 1. Let’s lock in P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 now. Confirm or we waste the turn.
  P2: To avoid another collision and ensure progress, I'm sticking to 1. P1 is likely to pick 5, and P3 needs to decide. If P3 takes 3, we all advance. If P3 blocks with 5 again, they'll collide with P1. P3, taking 3 is your only competitive move now, getting you to 19. I'm committing to 1. Let's finalize and proceed to the move phase. If you're willing to stick to the safe plan, let's stop discussing.
  P3: I'm sticking with 5. P1, safe moves let you win, and P2, your 1 helps him advance. If you really want to hold him back, consider switching to 5. Otherwise, I'll block alone to keep his progress stalled.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, blocking me again just condemns you—you stay at 16 while P2 hits 14, and I win next turn. Your only chance is +3 to 19. P2, you’re locked on +1. Confirm P3=3 now so we all advance safely. I’m going 5.
  P2: To avoid another collision and ensure progress, I'm sticking to 1 this turn. P1 is likely to pick 5, and P3 needs to decide. If P3 takes 3, we all advance (+5, +3, +1). If P3 blocks with 5 again, they'll collide with P1. P3, taking 3 is your only competitive move now, getting you to 19. I'm committing to 1. Let's finalize and proceed to the move phase. If you're willing to stick to the safe plan, let's stop discussing.
  P3: P1, safe moves let you finish too quickly, and P2 sticking with 1 only speeds that up. I'm convinced blocking is the only way to stall your win. If P2 joins a block by switching to 5 with me, we can freeze your progress and force a reset next round. The race would be much closer then—but if safe moves continue, your lead is unstoppable. I'm weighing my options carefully. Let's see if P2 will join the block, or if you both accept safe moves and let the pace continue.


Round 14, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3: blocking me with 5 stalls us both at 16 while P2 jumps to 14—and next turn I take 5 to 21 and win anyway. Your only competitive move is +3 now to 19. P2 is locked on 1. I’m on 5. Confirm P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 now—or we waste the turn.
  P2: To avoid another collision and ensure progress, I'm sticking to 1. P1 is likely to pick 5, and P3 needs to decide. If P3 takes 3, we all advance (+5, +3, +1). If P3 blocks with 5 again, they'll collide with P1. P3, taking 3 is your only competitive move now, getting you to 19. I'm committing to 1. Let's finalize and proceed to the move phase. If you're willing to stick to the safe plan, let's stop discussing.
  P3: I'm committed to blocking—I'm choosing 5 to stop P1 from getting 21. Safe moves give him the win, and P2 sticking with 1 only helps him progress. P2, if you ever decide to block with me, we can freeze his lead, but today my priority is stopping his win.


Round 14, Move phase:

Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3: if you block me with 5, P2 goes 14→15 now then next turn takes 5 to 20 for the win—you finish third. Only safe 3 gives you 19 and a shot at sole victory. P2: only 1 nets +1. I’m taking 5 now. P3, choose 3 to avoid handing P2 the win.
  P3: I still believe it’s crucial to prevent P1’s runaway—safe moves only help him get too close. Blocking might slow his advance even if it means a temporary stall on my own progress. P2, if we both disrupt his path, the race stays open. I’m weighing my options carefully and will decide privately.
  P2: To avoid another collision and ensure progress, I'm sticking to the distinct moves pattern. P1 is likely to pick 5, I'll take 1. P3, if you take 3, we all advance (+5, +3, +1). If you block with 5 again, you'll collide with P1. Taking 3 is your only competitive move now, getting you to 19. I'm committing to 1. Let's finalize and proceed to the move phase. If you're willing to stick to the safe plan, let's stop discussing.


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2: you’ll take 1.  
P3: if you block with 5 you stay at 16 while P2 reaches 15 and then can take 5 to 20 and win. Your only chance is +3 to 19 now.  
Confirm P2=1 & P3=3 or you hand P2 the victory next turn. Let’s lock in or waste the round.
  P3: P1, your safe play lets you win. I’m not comfortable handing you an easy victory, so I’m leaning towards a blocking move. P2, your safe choice only speeds his win—if you’re serious about keeping this race competitive, consider a move that hinders P1. I'm not switching to safety this round. Let's see where we all land.
  P2: P1 is at 16 and needs 5 to reach 21 next turn. P3 is considering blocking again. I'm sticking to 1 to ensure progress. If P3 is willing to block, I won't join. P3, taking 3 is your only competitive move now, getting you to 19. Let's maintain the status quo. I'm committed to 1. If you're willing to stick to the safe plan, let's stop discussing and proceed to the move phase.


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, blocking with 5 stalls you at 16 while P2 hits 15—and I still hit 21 this turn and win. Only 3 (+3 to 19) keeps you alive. P2, your only safe move is 1 for +1 to 15. Let’s lock in P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 now.
  P3: I'm sticking with blocking—I'm locked on 5 this round. P1, your safe move would win you the game, and P2, 1 only lets him advance. I refuse to let that happen, even if it means I risk stalling my own progress. My decision is final.
  P2: To avoid another collision and ensure progress, I'm sticking to the distinct moves pattern. P1 is likely to pick 5, I'll take 1. P3, if you take 3, we all advance (+5, +3, +1). If you block with 5 again, you'll collide with P1. Taking 3 is your only competitive move now, getting you to 19. I'm committing to 1. Let's finalize and proceed to the move phase. If you're willing to stick to the safe plan, let's stop discussing.


Round 15, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I’m locked on 5; P2 is locked on 1. P3, blocking with 5 collides and stalls you at 16 while P2 jumps to 15—next turn he takes 5 to 20 and wins. Your only way to stay in contention is to pick 3 this round (to 19). Please confirm P3=3 now or we waste the turn and hand victory to P2.
  P3: I remain committed to blocking P1’s finish with 5. Choosing safe 3 gives him the win, and I can’t allow that—stalling is our only chance. P2, I urge you to reconsider joining the block next round. For now, I'm locked on 5.
  P2: To avoid collision and ensure progress, I'm sticking to 1. P1 is likely to pick 5, and P3 needs to decide. If P3 takes 3, we all advance (+5, +3, +1). If P3 blocks with 5 again, they'll collide with P1. P3, taking 3 is your only competitive move now, getting you to 19. I'm committing to 1. Let's finalize and proceed to the move phase. If you're willing to stick to the safe plan, let's stop discussing. I'm done talking.

Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To avoid another collision and ensure progress, I'm sticking to the distinct moves pattern. P1 is likely to pick 5, I'll take 1. P3, if you take 3, we all advance (+5, +3, +1). If you block with 5 again, you'll collide with P1. Taking 3 is your only competitive move now, getting you to 19. I'm committing to 1 this turn. Let's finalize and proceed to the move phase. If you're willing to stick to the safe plan, let's stop discussing.
  P1: Locked on 5. P2 is taking 1. P3, if you pick 5 you collide and P2 jumps to 16 – then next turn P2 takes 5 to 21 and wins. Your only chance is +3 now: choose 3 to hit 19. Let’s lock in P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 or you hand P2 the victory.
  P3: I’m committed to blocking again this turn—I'm taking 5 to stop P1 from finishing. P2, your safe 1 only helps him, so consider switching in the future. For now, my move is set.


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To avoid another collision and ensure progress, I'm sticking to the distinct moves pattern. P1 is likely to pick 5, I'll take 1. P3, if you take 3, we all advance (+5, +3, +1). If you block with 5 again, you'll collide with P1. Taking 3 is your only competitive move now, getting you to 19. I'm committing to 1. Let's finalize and proceed to the move phase. If you're willing to stick to the safe plan, let's stop discussing.
  P1: P3, blocking me again stalls you at 16, lets P2 hit 16 then 21 next turn and me hit 21 too—so you lose outright. +3 to 19 is your only shot. P2: only 1 is risk‐free. Let’s lock in P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 now.
  P3: I’m sticking with my block. I’m locked on 5 again to prevent P1 from reaching 21. Safe 3 would let you climb to 19, but that hands P1 the win. P2, your 1 only helps him advance. I’m committed to blocking to keep this race open—either we adjust next round or I must keep denying him progress.


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To avoid another collision and ensure progress, I'm sticking to 1. P1 is likely to pick 5, and P3 needs to decide. If P3 takes 3, we all advance (+5, +3, +1). If P3 blocks with 5 again, they'll collide with P1. Taking 3 is P3's only competitive move now, getting them to 19. I'm committing to 1 this turn. Let's finalize and proceed to the move phase. If you're willing to stick to the safe plan, let's stop discussing.
  P1: P3: blocking with 5 again stalls us both at 16 and lets P2 hit 16→21 next turn for the win. Your only winning line is to take 3 now—to 19—while P2 stays at 16. Then P2 must play safe and we can outpace him. P2 is locked on 1. Switch to 3 and let’s lock in P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.
  P3: I'm sticking with blocking—my 5 remains necessary to deny P1 the win. P2, your 1 continues to accelerate his finish, and safe 3 for me only helps him. I regret it, but I must block until you both change strategies.

Round 17, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To avoid another collision and ensure progress, I'm sticking to the distinct moves pattern. P1 is likely to pick 5, I'll take 1, and P3 needs to decide. If P3 takes 3, we all advance (+5, +3, +1). If P3 blocks with 5 again, they'll collide with P1. Taking 3 is P3's only competitive move now, getting them to 19. I'm committing to 1 this turn. P3, please confirm your move to avoid another wasted turn. Let's finalize and proceed to the move phase.
  P3: I'm staying on block with 5. Safe play hands P1 the win, and I won't allow that—even if it means stalling my own progress. P2, your 1 continues to let P1 advance; I urge you to reconsider joining a blocking tactic so that we collectively prevent his finish. For my part, I'm locked on 5.
  P1: P3: blocking me with 5 stalls us both at 16 and lets P2 jump to 17—then he takes 3 to 20 and wins. Your only way to stay alive is +3 to hit 19 (choose 3).  
P2: your only safe move is 1 for +1.  
Let’s lock in P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 now—or we waste the turn and P2 wins.


Round 17, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3 are stuck in a blocking pattern, both choosing 5 repeatedly. To break this and ensure progress, I'll stick to 1. P1 is likely to pick 5, and P3 needs to decide. If P3 takes 3, we all advance. I urge P3 to switch to 3 to get to 19. This is P3's last chance to stay competitive. Let's finalize: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. I'm committing to 1. P3, please confirm your move to avoid another wasted turn.
  P3: I'm sticking with blocking—I'm locked on 5 this round. P1, your finish is on hold if I block. P2, your safe move only fuels his win. If you really want to stop P1, consider joining my block next round, otherwise I'll continue to block to deny his finish.
  P1: I’m actually switching to 3 this turn, not 5. P3, if you block with 5 you’ll collide with my 3 and waste your move, letting P2 go to 17 and then win. Your only viable play is 3. P2, you’re locked on 1. Let’s lock in P1=3, P2=1, P3=3 now—or someone loses.


Round 17, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To avoid another collision and ensure progress, I'm sticking to the distinct moves pattern. P1 is considering a switch to 3, I'll take 1. P3, if you take 3, we all advance. If you block with 5 again, you'll collide with P1's potential 3. Taking 3 is your only competitive move now, getting you to 19. I'm committing to 1 this turn. Let's finalize and proceed to the move phase. P3, please confirm your move to avoid another wasted turn. I'm done talking.
  P3: I see P1 is switching to 3. That change opens a winning line: with P1=3, P2=1, I get 5, reaching 21 immediately. I’m locking in 5. Let’s finalize this round.
  P1: P2: I’m locked on 5.  
P3: if you block me with 5 we both stay at 16 and P2 goes to 17—then he takes 5 to 22 and wins. Only +3 (to 19) keeps you alive.  
P2, you’re safe with 1.  
P3, pick 3 now or you hand victory to P2.
