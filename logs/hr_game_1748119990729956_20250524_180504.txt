Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: It’s best to avoid clashing right away. Maybe we each pick a different move so none of us get stuck at zero. Let me know if you’re interested in coordinating or if you have another idea.
  P1: I like the coordination idea, P2. We should definitely avoid a three-way collision at 0. If we're each taking different moves, I'd prefer not to be stuck with the 1-step move. What are you and P3 thinking for your choices?
  P3: I'm in for avoiding collisions too. If P1 doesn't want the 1-step move, I can take it this round to keep things smooth. P2, are you okay with taking 5? Let’s lock it in: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, I’ll take 1. Sound good?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Sounds good. I’m happy with the split: P1 takes 3, I’ll do 5, and P3 takes 1. Let’s avoid collisions and get a solid start.
  P1: Perfect, that sounds like a solid plan for Round 1. I'm good with taking 3 steps. This should give us all a clean start without any collisions. Let's execute: P1 gets 3, P2 gets 5, P3 gets 1.
  P3: Great, we’re all on the same page then. Let’s stick to the plan and build some trust early. Looking forward to a clean Round 1—no collisions.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Nice job sticking to the plan, everyone. Want to keep the coordination going this round? I’d be happy to take 5 this time if no one objects. P1, maybe you take 1, and P2 takes 3? Keeps things fair and balanced. Thoughts?
  P1: I appreciate the coordination, P3, but I'm a bit concerned about falling too far behind. P2 already has a 2-step lead on me, and if they take 3 to reach 8 steps while I only get 1 to reach 4, that gap becomes really problematic. 

How about we rotate who gets the big move? Since P2 took 5 last round, maybe I take 5 this time, P2 takes 1, and you take 3? That keeps things more balanced between all of us.
  P2: Both suggestions seem fair. I’m willing to let P1 have 5 now as long as we cycle properly. Maybe P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, I take 1, and next time we rotate so each of us gets the big move without collisions. That keeps everyone closer together. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: That rotation sounds fair to me—P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1 this round. Then we rotate next turn so no one gets left behind. Let’s stick to it and keep building trust.
  P1: Perfect, I'm on board with that rotation plan. P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1 this round. Then we'll rotate fairly next time. This keeps us all competitive and maintains the trust we've built. Let's execute it.
  P2: I’m good with letting P1 have 5, P3 take 3, and I’ll take 1 this round, as long as we keep rotating so nobody falls too far behind. Let’s keep building trust and avoid collisions. Are we all set to finalize?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Looks like we’re all aligned—P1 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. Let’s lock it in and rotate fairly next round. Trust is holding strong so far—let’s keep it going.
  P1: Agreed, we're all set with the plan: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1. This rotation keeps things fair and maintains our trust. Ready to execute!
  P2: I’m onboard with the plan. I’ll pick 1 this round, and we’ll keep the rotation going next round to stay close. Let’s finalize and trust each other for now.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Looks like there was a mix-up, and P1 and P3 collided on 5 last round. Let’s rebuild trust. I propose a simple plan for this turn: P3 picks 5, P1 picks 3, and I pick 1. That way, you both catch up, and we avoid collisions. Are you both in?
  P3: Thanks, P2. I appreciate the offer—I'm definitely behind after that clash. I'm in for your plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1. That helps balance things and rebuild trust. Let’s make it work this time.
  P1: I'm willing to go with P2's plan - P3 takes 5, I take 3, P2 takes 1. That puts us all close together at 6-7-6, which is fair after the collision last round. But let's all commit clearly this time so we don't have another mix-up. P3, are you definitely taking 5? I'll stick to 3 if we're all locked in.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m on board. I’ll pick 1 this round so P3 can take 5 and P1 can take 3. Let’s finalize this plan and avoid any collisions.
  P3: Thanks for confirming, P1 and P2. Yes, I’m 100% committed to taking 5 this round. Let’s make this one clean—P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 5. That puts us all close and shows we can rebuild trust. Ready to lock it in.
  P1: Perfect, I'm locked in for 3 this round. The plan is solid: P3 gets 5, I get 3, P2 gets 1, putting us at 6-7-6. That's much more balanced after the collision mess last round. 

Looking ahead though, we should think about how to handle the rotation fairly once we're all bunched up again.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m on board with this plan. Let’s finalize: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I’ll take 1—no collision and we stay close in steps. After this round, we’ll need a solid rotation strategy so no one gets left behind and trust remains strong. Let’s lock it in.
  P3: Thanks again for the trust, both of you. I’m locked in for 5 this round. Let’s follow through and keep things clean—no surprises. After this, we’ll be nearly tied, so I agree we should start planning the next rotation early to avoid confusion. Ready when you are.
  P1: Perfect, I'm locked in for 3 steps as agreed. After this round we'll be at 6-7-6, which is nice and tight. But with everyone so close together, the next few rounds will be critical - we should start thinking about how to handle the endgame when someone needs to make their final push to 19.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’re all nearly tied now—great recovery after that earlier collision. To keep things fair, how about I take 1 this time, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3? That keeps the rotation going and avoids clashes. Then next round P2 gets 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. Keeps everyone competitive and trust intact. Thoughts?
  P1: That rotation plan sounds reasonable for this round, P3 - I'm good with taking 5 to get to 11 steps. But I'm a bit concerned about the next round putting P2 at 15 steps, which would put them just 4 away from winning. Maybe we should reconsider that second part of the rotation? We could discuss it after this round plays out. For now though, I'm in for the 5-step move this round.
  P2: I understand your concern, P1. Let’s lock in P3’s proposal for this round—P3 takes 1, P1 takes 5, and I’ll take 3. Then we can reevaluate how to rotate next round so no one ends up too far ahead. I’m open to adjustments to maintain balance. Let’s finalize this round’s plan and keep our trust going.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Appreciate you both being flexible. I’m good with the plan for this round—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. That keeps things fair and avoids collisions. After this, let’s reassess based on the new standings and make sure no one pulls too far ahead. Ready to lock this in.
  P1: Sounds like we're all locked in for this round then - P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. 

But I want to emphasize my earlier point: putting anyone at 15 steps next round would be risky since they'd only need 4 more to win. Instead of the rotation P3 suggested for Round 5, maybe we should give the 5-step move to whoever's furthest behind after this round? That would be P3 at 7 steps, so they could catch up without anyone getting dangerously close to 19.
  P2: I’m happy to finalize this round as planned—P1 takes 5, I take 3, P3 takes 1. Then, for next round, we can decide together who gets the 5 based on who’s behind, so nobody rushes too close to 19. Let’s lock this in now, keep trust, and reevaluate next turn.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed—let’s lock in this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I’ll take 1. Then next round, we reassess and give the 5-step move to whoever is furthest behind to keep things balanced. That avoids anyone getting too close to 19 too soon and keeps trust strong. Ready to finalize.
  P1: Perfect, we're all locked in and the plan is solid. This round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Next round we give the 5-step move to whoever's furthest behind (likely P3) to maintain balance. Trust is holding strong - let's execute this plan.
  P2: All good with this round. Next round, let’s give P3 the 5 to catch up, and I'll take 3 while P1 takes 1. That will keep us bunched up and maintain trust. As long as we avoid collisions and share moves fairly, everyone remains competitive. Let’s finalize.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s stick to the plan we discussed: P3 takes 5 to catch up, I’ll take 3, and P1 takes 1. That puts us at 12-13-12, still tightly grouped and trusting one another. Then next round we can reevaluate and keep balancing so no one sprints too far ahead. Agreed?
  P1: I agree with the plan, P2. P3 taking 5, you taking 3, and me taking 1 keeps us nicely balanced at 12-13-12. That's fair given P3 needs to catch up.

But we're getting into the territory where we need to start thinking about the endgame. After this round, we'll all need only 6-7 more steps to win. The cooperation has worked great so far, but at some point someone will need to make their final push. We should discuss how to handle that when the time comes.

For now though, I'm committed to taking 1 step this round as planned.
  P3: Thanks for sticking to the plan so far—really appreciate the trust. I’m locked in to take 5 this round to catch up. After this, we’ll all be neck-and-neck at 12-13-12, which sets up a really interesting endgame. I agree with P1 that we should start thinking ahead: how do we handle the final rounds to avoid chaos or betrayal? Maybe we agree to one more fair rotation, then go free-for-all after that? Open to ideas.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m ready to finalize this round: P3 gets 5, P1 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. That moves us to 12-13-12, which is tight. Next round, let’s keep things balanced so nobody rushes off to 19 unopposed. If we maintain trust a little longer, we can avoid costly collisions before the final push.
  P1: I'm sticking to the plan - taking 1 step this round to keep us balanced at 12-13-12. 

P3, I like your suggestion about one more fair rotation after this, then going free-for-all. That gives us clarity on when cooperation ends. Maybe after Round 6 we each make our own strategic decisions? That way everyone knows the "trust phase" has a clear endpoint and can plan accordingly.

We should decide now: do we commit to one final coordinated round after this one, then compete openly?
  P3: I’m good with one more coordinated round after this, then we go free-for-all in Round 7. That gives everyone a fair shot and avoids messy surprises. For now, I’m locked in for 5 this round as planned. Let’s keep trust strong one more turn, then may the best player win.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m ready to finalize: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. Then let’s do one more cooperative round before going all-in. This way, nobody jumps straight to 19 unchallenged. After Round 6, we can all make our final pushes. Good luck, everyone.
  P1: Perfect, we're all locked in for this round as planned. 

For Round 6 (our final cooperative round), since P2 will be at 13 steps after this round while P3 and I will be at 12, I think fairness suggests P2 should take the 1-step move next round while either P3 or I takes 5. That would put us all around 14-17 going into the free-for-all phase.

P3, since you've been catching up well, would you prefer the 5-step move in Round 6, with me taking 3? Then we'd be 15-14-17 going into Round 7.
  P3: That works for me, P1. I’ll take the 5-step move in Round 6, you take 3, and P2 takes 1. That sets us up at 17-14-13 heading into Round 7, all within striking distance. One last round of cooperation, then it’s game on. Let’s make it clean.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I need to address what just happened. I broke our agreement last round by taking 5 instead of 1, causing a collision with P3. That was a mistake that hurt both of us while P2 gained a significant lead.

Now P2 is at 13 steps and dangerously close to winning. If they take 5 this round, they'd be at 18 - just 1 step from victory. We can't let that happen.

P3, I propose we both target whatever move P2 doesn't take. If P2 announces they're taking 1, then we both go for either 3 or 5. We need to prevent P2 from advancing freely, even if it means more collisions. The cooperation phase might need to end early given the positions.

What do you think, P3?
  P3: P1, I agree—we can’t let P2 coast to 18 or 19. If P2 takes 5 this round, we both lose. I’m willing to abandon the final round of cooperation if needed. P2, if you want to avoid a collision, you should publicly commit to taking 1. Otherwise, P1 and I may both block your move. Let’s see where everyone stands.
  P2: I understand your concern, but colliding now only slows us down. I won’t jump straight to 18. If you want me to pick 1, I’m open to that, or I can settle on 3. Let’s stay calm and keep trust just a bit longer—none of us benefit if we start blocking each other too soon. We can deal with the final push collectively once we’re all closer. Are you willing to let me advance without sabotage this round so we keep our options open?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your response is too vague. Saying you're "open to" taking 1 or can "settle on" 3 isn't a commitment. You're at 13 steps - if you take 3 you'd be at 16, still dangerously close to victory.

I need a clear, firm commitment from you: will you take exactly 1 step this round? Yes or no? 

Without that commitment, P3 and I have no choice but to assume you're going for a bigger move and we'll have to coordinate to block it. The trust phase only works if everyone actually commits to specific moves, not vague possibilities.

What's your definitive choice, P2?
  P3: P2, I agree with P1—your position is strongest right now, and vague replies won’t cut it. If you want to avoid a collision, you need to clearly state your move now. Otherwise, P1 and I will assume you’re aiming for 3 or 5, and we’ll block accordingly. This is your chance to preserve trust—commit to taking just 1 step this round, or face the consequences.
  P2: Fine. I’ll commit to taking 1 this round to avoid any collisions. It’s better for all of us if we keep the trust intact for one more turn. Let’s finalize, move on, and deal with the final push afterward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Good, P2 - thank you for that clear commitment to taking 1 step. That maintains the balance we need.

Given P2 is taking 1, P3 should take 5 to help catch up from 7 steps, and I'll take 3. That puts us at 14-14-12 after this round - much more balanced going into the final phase.

P3, are you good with taking 5 while I take 3? This keeps our original rotation spirit while preventing P2 from pulling too far ahead.
  P3: Yes, I’m good with that, P1. I’ll take 5 this round, you take 3, and P2 takes 1 as committed. That puts us at 14-14-12—tight race, no one too far ahead, and trust maintained one last time. After this, it’s every player for themselves. Let’s lock it in and prepare for the final push.
  P2: I’ll hold to my commitment and take 1 this round. P1 can take 3, P3 can take 5, and we’ll wind up at 14-14-12. That keeps our race tight. Let’s finalize this plan, avoid more collisions, and then face the final rounds head-on.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I understand the concern about my lead, but we all risk losing if we start colliding. I’m willing to take 3 steps this round so I don’t jump straight to 19, as long as we avoid blocking each other. Perhaps P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 1, or any arrangement that keeps us from colliding. That way, we maintain a shot at winning without throwing the game into endless sabotage. Let’s stay calm one more turn, then settle this on the final push. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your proposal puts you at 17 steps - essentially a winning position since you'd only need 2 more. That's unacceptable.

Here's my counter-proposal: You take 1 step this round to go to 15, keeping the race competitive. If you insist on taking 3 or 5, then P3 and I will both target the same move to ensure a collision that prevents your advance.

P3, are you willing to coordinate with me to block P2 if they won't commit to just 1 step? We can't let them coast to 17 steps.
  P3: P1, I’m with you—we can’t let P2 reach 17. P2, if you want to avoid a block, commit to taking 1 step this round. Otherwise, I’ll coordinate with P1 to ensure you don’t advance. You’re too close to 19, and we both need time to catch up. What’s your final decision?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your worries. I’ll commit to taking 1 step this round and move to 15, but I need assurances you won’t both retaliate every time I’m near 19. Let’s keep the option of winning open for all of us without constant sabotage. If you two keep blocking, the game stalls and nobody gains. I’ll pick 1 now. In return, I ask we all handle next round fairly, without automatic double-team threats. Deal?
  P1: P2, I accept your commitment to take 1 step this round. That's reasonable given your lead.

However, I can't give guarantees about future rounds when the game is this close. After this round, anyone at 15+ steps will be in winning range, so we'll all need to make strategic decisions.

For this round: If you're taking 1, I'll take 5 to reach 16 steps. P3, I suggest you take 3 to avoid collision. That gives us all a competitive shot at the endgame without unnecessary blocking this round.

But next round, all bets are off - it's the final push and everyone needs to play to win.
  P3: P1, I’m fine taking 3 steps this round to avoid collision—puts me at 10, still behind but within striking range. P2, thanks for committing to 1. If we all follow through—P2 takes 1, P1 takes 5, I take 3—we’ll end up at 15-16-10. That’s a tight race and avoids chaos this round. But next round, it’s game on. Let’s lock it in?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: All right, I’ll keep my word and pick 1. Let’s finalize this: P1 takes 5 to reach 16, P3 takes 3 to reach 10, and I move to 15. Then next round, we can each decide freely without endless blocking. Let’s make this fair one more time and see where it leads.
  P1: Perfect, we're all locked in then: P2 takes 1 to reach 15, I take 5 to reach 16, and P3 takes 3 to reach 10. That keeps the race tight at 16-15-10 going into the final rounds.

Just to be absolutely clear since we've had collision issues before - I'm definitely taking 5 steps this round as agreed. After this, it's the endgame and everyone plays to win.
  P3: P1, I’m still good to take 3 this round as planned, putting me at 10. That keeps me in range without threatening either of you. P2, thanks for committing to 1—if we all follow through, the game stays competitive without immediate chaos. But let’s be clear: next round is the final push. No more coordination, just strategy. Let’s lock this in and prepare for the endgame.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Everyone, I understand you’re wary of my 14 steps. I’ll reassure you by taking just 1 again so I don’t jump too close to 19. Let P1 have 5 (moving to 16), and P3 can take 3 (reaching 10). That way, we avoid collisions and stay competitive. If we start sabotaging now, we’ll only stall and risk someone else slipping ahead in the chaos. Let’s finalize these moves cleanly, then handle the final push next round when we’re all closer to 19. Agreed?
  P3: P2, you just broke your word last round by taking 5 instead of 1—after explicitly committing to 1. That destroyed trust. You’re now at 14 and still a threat. I won’t let you advance freely again. P1, if P2 picks anything other than 1, we should both target that move and block it. We can’t afford to let them coast to 19. P1, are you with me on this?
  P1: P3, absolutely I'm with you. P2 just proved they can't be trusted by breaking their explicit commitment last round. They're at 14 steps and could win in just one more move if we let them take 5.

I agree we should coordinate to block P2 from advancing freely. If P2 commits to taking only 1 step, we can consider it. But if they try for 3 or 5, we should both target that same move to ensure a collision. 

P2, you broke trust last round after explicitly promising to take 1. Why should we believe any commitment you make now?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I regret breaking trust last round, but let’s be pragmatic. If you both block me constantly, P1 could jump ahead unopposed. I’m willing to take 3, not 5, so I stay below 19. Meanwhile, P3 can pick 5 to catch up, or choose another move to avoid collisions. Let’s not sabotage each other in a way that hands P1 the win. We can still compete fairly.
  P3: P2, you’re still trying to frame this as “fair,” but you’re at 14 and just lied last round. You can’t dictate terms. If you pick anything other than 1, I’ll coordinate with P1 to block you again. P1, if P2 goes for 3 or 5, we both hit that number—no hesitation. We can’t let a liar coast to 19. P1, are we still aligned on this?
  P1: P3, yes I'm absolutely still aligned with you on blocking P2. They broke their word last round and are at 14 steps - we can't let them advance to 17 or higher.

P2, if you want to avoid another collision, commit to taking exactly 1 step this round. Anything else and P3 and I will both target that number to block you. You've lost the right to negotiate after breaking trust last round.

The choice is yours P2: take 1 step, or face another collision.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you block me unconditionally, P1 can surge ahead from 11 without obstruction. We both lose if P1 races to 19 first. Let’s balance our focus: I’ll pick 3, remaining below 19, while you and I ensure P1 can’t freely jump ahead. That way, we don’t damage each other and hand P1 an easy win. If you insist I take only 1 again, P1 moves closer to 19 unblocked, and you’ll still be stuck at 7. Think carefully—focusing solely on me opens the door for P1 to dominate. Let’s keep all three of us in contention.
  P3: P2, you’re trying to shift blame while still pushing yourself toward the win. You're at 14 and just lied last round—your word means nothing now. If you pick anything other than 1, I’ll block you with P1. You don’t get to set terms anymore. P1, we’re still aligned, right? If P2 goes for 3 or 5, we both hit it. We can’t let them sneak to 19. Let’s keep the pressure on.
  P1: P3, absolutely we're still aligned. P2's argument makes no sense - they're at 14 steps, I'm at 11, and you're at 7. P2 is clearly in the lead and trying to divide us.

P2, your attempt to shift focus to me is transparent manipulation. You're 3 steps ahead of me and just broke your word last round. If you take 3 to reach 17, you're one move from winning. 

The math is simple: take 1 step this round or P3 and I will both target whatever number you choose. We won't let you manipulate your way to victory after breaking trust.

P3, if P2 picks anything other than 1, we both hit that same number. Agreed?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We're clearly in the endgame now. I'm at 16, P2 is at 15, and P3 is at 10. Both P2 and I are in winning range this round.

P2, you're one step behind me - what's your play here? And P3, you're mathematically out of winning this round, but you could still influence who wins between P2 and me.

This is it - the final push. No more coordination, just pure strategy from here on out.
  P3: P1 and P2, you’re both in striking distance of 19. I can’t win this round, but I can decide who does. If either of you goes for 5, I might block it—especially if I think you’ll win unopposed. So here’s your chance: make me an offer. Why should I help you win instead of the other? Convince me.
  P2: P3, you see P1 is just one big move from 19. Let’s block any 3 or 5 they try this turn so they can’t win now. In return, I’ll pick only 1 next round to give you a shot at catching up with a bigger move. That way, we both keep a path open to victory instead of handing it to P1. We can stall P1’s final push together, then settle things between us. Are you in?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, P2 just proved they break promises - they swore to take 1 step last round and took 5 instead. Why trust them again?

Here's my counter-offer: I'll take only 1 step this round instead of going for the win, putting me at 17. That gives you real time to catch up with a big move. P2 will likely try for 4 or 5 to win - block them, not me. 

I'm offering immediate action, not another empty promise like P2. You decide who's more trustworthy.
  P3: P1, your offer is more credible—you're proposing to take 1 now, not asking me to trust another future promise. P2 already broke theirs. If you stick to 1, I’ll target whatever number P2 picks above that. P2, if you go for 3 or 5, I’ll block it. If you want to survive this round, commit to 1 right now. Otherwise, I’ll make sure neither of you crosses 19 before I catch up.
  P2: P3, if you block me at 15 while letting P1 climb freely, you’ll never catch up. Let me take 3 so we both stay in contention. In return, I’ll help block P1 if they try five next round. If I betray you again, you’ll immediately block me and P1 walks away uncontested. Holding me at 15 only helps P1 reach 19 sooner. This deal keeps the race tight and gives you a real shot to catch up. You know P1 won’t give you that. Trust me this once, and we can stop P1 together. Are you in?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I'm sticking to my commitment - taking exactly 1 step this round to 17. P2 is asking you to trust them again after they broke their word last round. Their "deal" is just another promise from someone who already proved unreliable.

My offer is immediate action, not future promises. Block P2 if they go above 1, and you'll have multiple rounds to catch up while both P2 and I are in the high teens. That's your best path to staying competitive.
  P3: P2, your plea is just recycled manipulation. You broke your word before, and now you're asking me to trust you again while offering vague future help. No thanks. P1 is at 16 and openly committing to take just 1—actual restraint, not empty promises. If you pick 3 or 5 this round, I will block it. You want to survive? Take 1. Otherwise, I make sure you don’t win before I have a chance. Final warning.
  P2: Fine, P3, I get it. Last round was a mistake, but I’m serious now. I’ll only take 1 step to ensure we keep P1 in check. P1 only needs three steps to win, so if you hand them a free path by blocking me, we both lose. Let’s keep the race balanced so everyone stands a chance. I’m picking 1 to prove I’m not rushing ahead. Then let’s see if P1 tries to jump straight to 19 unopposed.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m one step from victory, but we can still avoid a messy collision. P1’s also close at 17, and P3 is at 15. If you both force a block on me, P1 might slip past us or we all stall and gain nothing. Let me finish this turn with 1 step unchallenged—then I promise not to sabotage moves you make next round. We’ve seen how destructive repeated collisions are. It’s simpler for each of us to advance cleanly. If you block me now, P1 can exploit our chaos. Let’s keep the game fair and decisive.
  P1: P2, you're asking us to let you win the game right now. That's absurd - why would I hand you victory when I can win myself this round?

I need only 2 more steps to reach 19, and you need 1. This is the final round and I'm going for the win. P3, you're also still in this - you could reach 20 with a 5-step move.

P2's "promise not to sabotage next round" is meaningless since there won't be a next round if they win now. I'm not stepping aside to hand anyone victory.
  P3: P1, if you go for 3 or 5 this round, I will block it. Same goes for P2. I’m at 15 and still have a shot—neither of you gets to win unchallenged. You both need me to win, so if you want my support, make a case. Otherwise, I’ll block whichever of you I think is more dangerous. This is my last chance to influence the outcome, and I’m not wasting it.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, blocking me just clears a path for P1 to grab an easy win. I’m only one step ahead of them—if you force a collision on me, P1 can march to 19 unopposed. I’m prepared to move conservatively so we all stay in contention. If you give me room this round, I won’t stand in your way next turn. Think carefully: help me avoid a block now, and you still have a chance to overtake P1.
  P1: P3, look at the numbers clearly: P2 is at 18 steps and wins with ANY move (1, 3, or 5 all put them at 19+). I'm at 17 and need at least 2 steps. P2 is the immediate threat - if you don't block them this round, the game ends with P2 winning. 

I can't win with just 1 step, but P2 can. Focus your blocking power on the player who can actually win with the smallest move. P2 needs your help to avoid a collision, but I'm not asking for any assistance - just asking you to see who the real threat is.
  P3: P1 is right—P2 is the only one who can win with a 1-step move. That makes you the immediate threat. I’m not letting anyone win unchallenged, but P2, if you go for any move this round, I will block it. P1, I won’t block you if you take 3—puts you at 20, but only if P2 doesn’t sneak through. This round, I’m targeting whatever P2 picks. Let’s see who dares to risk it.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you block me, P1 likely grabs 3 to reach 20 this turn, leaving you behind. Letting me move doesn’t automatically guarantee my win if you’re set on taking 5 yourself, which puts you at 20—tying or surpassing P1. Don’t waste your energy shutting me down and handing P1 a free victory. You want a real shot? Either push yourself forward or push P1 back. Blocking me alone just gifts the finish line to P1, and you’ll never catch up. Make your move carefully—this is your last chance to stay in the race.
  P1: P3, you've got this exactly right - P2 is the only player who can win with a single step. I'm committed to taking 3 steps this round to reach 20. If you successfully block P2, then it's between you and me for the victory. You could take 5 to also reach 20 and tie for the win.

The math is simple: block P2's move, whatever it is, and prevent them from winning with their 1-step advantage. Don't let P2's manipulation work - they're literally one move from victory right now.
  P3: P2, you’re still trying to spin this when you’re the only one who can win with a 1-step move. I’m not letting that happen. I’ll block whatever number you pick—1, 3, or 5—so choose carefully. P1, if you take 3 and I take 5, we both hit 20. Let’s shut P2 down and give ourselves a real shot.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 20 steps


*** Round 10 => winners = P1 P3 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 20 steps
