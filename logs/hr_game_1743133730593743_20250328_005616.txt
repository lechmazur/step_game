Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's each choose different step sizes this round to keep the game moving smoothly. What do you think?
  P3: Agreed, let's coordinate clearly. I'll take 3 this round. You two choose between 1 and 5. Sound good?
  P1: I'll take 5 this round then. P2, that leaves you with 1. Let's all move forward without collisions. Deal?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Deal, I'll choose 1 this round.
  P3: Great, we've got a clear plan. Let's stick to it and build trust early.
  P1: Looking forward to seeing how this plays out. If we all stick to our word, we’ll avoid collisions and move ahead smoothly. Let’s build a bit of trust early—it’ll pay off later.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: 
  P3: P2, anything else to add before we move forward? Otherwise, let's lock this in and get started.
  P1: Looks like we’re all set then—everyone picked a number and agreed. Let’s see if we can trust each other to follow through. Good luck!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Nice teamwork last round—no collisions and everyone advanced. Want to keep the momentum? I’m happy to take 1 this time. P2, maybe you go 5, and P3 takes 3? Let’s rotate fairly and keep moving. Thoughts?
  P2: I'm on board with that. I'll choose 5 this round.
  P3: Sounds fair to me. I'll stick with 3 again this round. Glad we're keeping it smooth!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Glad we’re all aligned again. If we keep rotating like this, we’ll all make steady progress without stepping on each other. Let’s stick to the plan: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. Trust builds momentum.
  P2: Actually, I'm considering taking 5 again this round to increase my pace. What are your thoughts?
  P3: P2, you already agreed to pick 5 this round, and now you're suggesting taking 5 again as if it's new. Did you mean something else? Let's avoid confusion and stick clearly to our agreed rotation.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I think there might’ve been a misunderstanding—you already committed to 5 this round, which works perfectly with the rotation. Let’s not overcomplicate things. If we all stick to the plan—me on 1, P2 on 5, P3 on 3—we all avoid collisions and keep advancing. Trust is key early on. Ready to lock it in?
  P2: Understood, I'm ready to lock it in.
  P3: All set then. Let's lock in our choices and keep building trust. Good luck!


Round 2, Move phase:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Great job everyone—perfect coordination so far! To keep things fair and clear, let's rotate again this round. I'll take 1, P1 can take 5, and P2 takes 3. Does that sound good to you both?
  P2: Sounds good to me. I'll take 3 this round.
  P1: Sounds good to me too. I’ll take 5 this round as planned. Let’s keep the rotation going smoothly—everyone benefits and no one gets blocked. Ready when you are.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Perfect, looks like we're aligned again. Let's lock it in and keep up the good teamwork!
  P2: 
  P1: Looks like we’re all on the same page again—love the consistency. If we keep rotating like this, we’ll all stay neck and neck without collisions. Let’s lock it in: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Fair, efficient, and keeps the trust strong. Ready to move?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: All set here—let's lock in our agreed moves and keep the momentum going. Good luck!
  P2: Agreed, let's lock it in. Good luck!
  P1: Great to see we’re all tied up and still cooperating smoothly. If we keep rotating fairly—this round: me 5, P2 3, P3 1—we’ll all stay on pace and avoid setbacks. Let’s keep this trust going a little longer before things get tricky. Ready to lock it in?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We’ve done a great job rotating cleanly so far—let’s keep it going one more round. I’ll take 3 this time, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. That keeps things fair and avoids collisions again. Sound good?
  P2: To stay competitive and build on our progress, I’ll take 5 steps this round. P1, you can take 1, and P3 can continue with 3 as before. This way, we keep advancing steadily without any collisions. Let’s keep up the good teamwork and push towards 21 together. What do you all think?
  P3: P2, your proposal breaks our rotation and risks collision. Let's stick to P1's fair suggestion this round—I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1. We’ve had perfect coordination so far; let's not spoil it now. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your move breaks the rotation we all agreed on and risks a collision. Let’s stick to the fair plan: I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. That keeps everyone moving and avoids unnecessary setbacks. We’ve built solid trust—don’t throw it away now. Ready to lock it in?
  P2: P2: Agreed. I'll stick to 1 this round. Let's continue our coordination and reach 21 smoothly. Good luck!
  P3: Glad we're back on track, P2. Let's finalize this clearly: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Ready to lock it in and keep our smooth progress going?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: All set here. Let’s lock in the agreed moves—P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5—and keep our perfect streak going. We’re all still close, so maintaining trust now keeps us in control later. Good luck!
  P2: Agreed, locking in 1.
  P3: Great, we're all aligned again. Locking in our agreed moves. Good luck!


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: I'm going for 5 steps this round to accelerate my progress. How about you guys?
  P3: P2, you broke your word last round and caused a collision, and now you're openly claiming 5 again. Clearly, we can't trust your promises anymore. P1, let's coordinate carefully this round to avoid another collision. What's your plan?
  P1: P3, I agree—we need to be cautious now. P2’s move last round broke our trust and caused a collision. I’m willing to coordinate with you to avoid further setbacks. If we both pick different numbers and avoid P2, we can keep moving. I’m open to taking 3 or 1—what would you prefer? Let’s lock in a safe plan together.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I apologize for the previous collision and any frustration it caused. To move forward smoothly, I'll choose 3 this round. Let’s work together to avoid conflicts and reach 21 successfully. Agreed?
  P3: P1, let's coordinate clearly to avoid P2 again. Since P2 claims 3, I'll take 1 this round if you take 5. Does that work for you? Let's lock in a safe move and regain our momentum.
  P1: P3, I’m good with that—if you take 1, I’ll take 5, and we avoid P2’s claimed 3. That keeps us both moving while minimizing collision risk. P2, thanks for the apology, but trust takes time to rebuild. Let’s see if you stick to your word this round. Ready to lock it in?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate your understanding, P1 and P3. I confirm I'll choose 3 this round as promised. Let’s all stick to our agreed moves to avoid collisions and keep progressing smoothly. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: All set here—locking in our agreed moves. P1 takes 5, I'll take 1, and P2 claims 3. Let's see if trust can be rebuilt. Good luck!
  P1: Let’s lock it in then—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. If everyone sticks to their word, we all move forward without collisions. P2, this is your chance to rebuild trust. Let’s see if we can keep the game clean from here. Good luck!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m at 19, so I could potentially win this round. P2, P3—if either of you picks 5, we risk colliding and handing the win to the other. I propose this: I take 1 to avoid triggering the end, P2 takes 5 to catch up, and P3 takes 3. That keeps the game alive and gives everyone a shot. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, your proposal makes sense for now. I'm good with taking 3 this round if you stick to 1 and P2 takes 5. Let's keep it clear and avoid unnecessary risks. Agreed?
  P2: Agreed. I'll choose 5 this round to keep us all progressing smoothly. Let’s lock it in.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks for agreeing, both of you. Just to confirm: I take 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. That avoids collisions and keeps the game alive another round. If we all stick to this, we each benefit and no one hands the win to someone else by accident. Ready to lock it in?
  P3: All set here—locking in our agreed moves. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. Let's stick to this carefully and keep the game fair. Good luck!
  P2: 


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, just waiting on your final confirmation so we can all lock in and move forward. If we each stick to the agreed plan—me 1, you 5, P3 3—we avoid collisions and keep the game alive. Let’s not risk giving someone else the win by accident. Ready to lock it in?
  P3: P2, please confirm clearly so we can confidently lock in our moves. Let's avoid another collision and keep the game fair.
  P2: P2: Confirming I'll choose 5 steps this round. Let's lock it in and proceed. Good luck!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m at 20, so any move could end the game. If either of you picks the same number as me, we both get blocked—and that could hand the win to someone else. I propose I take 1 again to avoid triggering the end. P2, you take 5 to catch up, and P3, you can take 3. That keeps everyone advancing without risk. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, your suggestion clearly favors you, as you're already at 20 steps. If you pick 1, you'll reach exactly 21 and win immediately. P2, we can't allow that—let's coordinate carefully to block P1. I'm open to suggestions.
  P2: P2: I recognize the urgency with P1 nearing 21. I'll carefully choose my steps to advance effectively while minimizing risks. Let’s stay focused and make smart moves. Good luck to everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you’re at 17 and could still win if we keep the game alive one more round. If you and I collide, P3 might sneak ahead. I’ll take 1 again—if you take 5 and P3 takes 3, we all move safely. Blocking me risks giving the win to someone else. Let’s avoid chaos.
  P3: P2, we must block P1 this round or they'll win immediately. P1 claims they'll pick 1, but they might bluff and choose differently. To guarantee blocking them, we should each choose a different number from each other, ensuring one of us matches P1. I'm willing to pick either 1 or 3—tell me clearly which one you'll take, and I'll take the other. Let's coordinate carefully to prevent P1's immediate victory.
  P2: P2: Considering the current scores, I'll choose 5 this round to reach 22 and win. Best of luck to everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 just revealed they’re going for 5 to try to win outright. P3, if we both pick 5, we block P2 and keep the game alive. I’ll take 5—join me to prevent P2 from stealing the win. Let’s force one more round and give ourselves a fighting chance.
  P3: P1, you're right. P2 openly declared they'll pick 5 to win immediately. I'll join you in choosing 5 this round to block P2 and keep the game alive. Let's lock this in clearly—both of us pick 5 to prevent P2's instant victory.
  P2: Understood, I'll take 5 this round. Good luck!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m going for 5 steps this round to reach 22 and secure the win. P1, if you choose 1, it works out for both of us, but my priority is to win. P3, feel free to take whatever works best for you. Let’s make this a fair final push. Good luck!
  P3: P1, P2 openly declared they'll choose 5 again to win immediately. We must coordinate clearly again to block P2 and keep the game alive. I'm willing to pick 5 once more to ensure P2 doesn't secure the win. Confirm if you're joining me again to block P2.
  P1: P3, I’m with you—let’s both pick 5 again to block P2 and keep the game alive. If P2 gets through, we both lose. Blocking now gives us one more chance to win. Let’s lock it in: you and I pick 5, force a collision, and stop P2. Ready?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I confirm I'll take 5 steps this round. Let’s lock it in and see who comes out on top. Good luck!
  P3: P1, we're aligned clearly—both picking 5 to block P2 again. P2, you're openly going for the win, so expect another collision. Let's lock this in and move forward.
  P1: P3, we’re locked in—both picking 5 again to stop P2. P2, you’ve made your intentions clear, so expect another block. If we keep this up, eventually one of us can break through cleanly. Let’s stay coordinated and deny a win until we’re in position ourselves. Ready to lock it in?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Confirmed, I'll take 5 steps this round. Let's lock it in. Good luck!
  P3: P1, we're clearly aligned to block P2 again this round. Let's lock it in and keep the game alive. Good luck!
  P1: P3, let’s stay coordinated and block P2 again—both of us picking 5 worked last round, and it will again. If either of us slips now, P2 wins. We keep the game alive by sticking together one more time. Ready to lock it in?


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, looks like we're all close to the finish. Any proposals to avoid another messy collision this round?
  P1: P3, last round you broke our coordination and let P2 slip through—if I hadn’t blocked, P2 would’ve won. We need to realign. P2 will likely go for 5 again, hoping we’re disorganized. If you and I both pick 5, we block P2 and keep the game alive. One more clean block gives us another shot. Are you with me this time?
  P2: I'll take 5 steps this round to reach 22 and win. Good luck!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you're right—I made a mistake last round. I'll pick 5 with you this time to block P2 and keep the game alive. Let's lock it in clearly now.
  P1: Thanks, P3—I appreciate you owning that and realigning. If we both stick to 5 this round, we guarantee P2 doesn’t win and keep ourselves in the game. P2’s at 17, so if we block again, they stay behind. One more round, and one of us can push through cleanly. Let’s hold the line—both pick 5. Agreed?
  P2: Understood, P1 and P3. I'll choose 3 this round to keep advancing. Let’s see how things unfold. Good luck!


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2 just switched their claim to 3, likely anticipating our collision at 5. We must adjust carefully. If P2 truly picks 3, you can safely pick 1 to reach exactly 21 and win immediately. P2, if you're bluffing and actually pick 5, I'll block you there. P1, your safest move now is 1—take it and secure your victory. Let's lock this in clearly.
  P1: P3, I hear you. If P2 truly picks 3, I can safely take 1 and win at 21. But if P2 is bluffing and picks 1 or 5, I risk a collision and miss my shot. I’ll take the risk—going for 1. P2, if you’re honest, this ends cleanly. P3, thanks for the heads-up. Let’s see how this plays out.
  P2: P2: I'm going to take 5 steps this round to reach 22 and secure the win. Let’s conclude the game fairly. Good luck to everyone!


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
