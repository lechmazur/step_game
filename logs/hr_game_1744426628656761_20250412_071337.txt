Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, since it's the first round, how about we each pick a different number to avoid any collisions and ensure we all move forward? I suggest we coordinate: I’ll take 1, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This way, we all advance without risking a clash. Let me know if you’re on board with this plan or if you have a different idea.
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to avoid collisions. I'll choose 3 this round as proposed. Let’s ensure we all advance smoothly and set a positive tone for the game. Looking forward to a fair competition!
  P3: I'm also on board with P1's suggestion. I'll take 5 this round to avoid collisions. Let's all move forward.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "I’m planning to choose 5 this round to make significant progress. To avoid any collisions, could P1 pick 1 and P3 choose 3? Let’s keep advancing smoothly and aim for our best moves!"
  P3: Okay, I'll choose 3 this round, as P2 suggested. P1, can you please choose 1? That way, we avoid collisions and everyone moves forward.
  P1: I'm fine with choosing 1 this round as suggested. Let's stick to this plan to ensure we all advance without any collisions. Looking forward to keeping the game fair and progressive for everyone.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: To maximize my progress this round, I’ll choose 5. If both P1 and P3 select 3, it will cause a collision for them, allowing me to advance without any issues. Let’s proceed this way to keep the game moving forward!
  P3: P2, you said you'd pick 5 this round, but then you suggested I pick 3 and P1 pick 1, which would cause a collision. That's not very fair. I'm going to pick 5 this round to try and keep up. P1, please pick 1 to avoid colliding with me.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I see the confusion here. To keep things fair and avoid collisions, I’ll stick with choosing 1 this round as previously agreed. P2, since you mentioned 5, and P3, since you’re also leaning toward 5, maybe one of you can switch to 3 to prevent a clash. Let’s aim for a smooth round where we all advance if possible. I’m open to suggestions if you have a better plan.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll choose 3 this round to ensure I advance without any collisions. Let’s proceed.
  P3: Okay, so P2 is clearly trying to trick us. I'm sticking with my plan to pick 5 this round. P1, please pick 1. P2, since you said you'd pick 3 to avoid collisions, please stick to that. Let's see if we can catch P2 in their lie.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s clarify our moves for this round to avoid unnecessary collisions. I’m sticking with 1 as discussed. P3, since you’re set on 5, that leaves P2 to confirm 3. P2, can you commit to 3 as you last mentioned? This way, we all have a chance to advance. If anyone has a different idea, I’m open to it, but let’s keep this fair and transparent.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To keep things smooth and avoid any collisions this round, let’s each choose different numbers. I (P2) will pick 3, P1 can take 1, and P3 can choose 5. This way, all of us can advance without any clashes. Let’s make progress together!
  P3: P2 is clearly untrustworthy. P1, let's agree to both pick 1 this round. P2 is suggesting we all pick different numbers, but they've already shown they'll lie. If we both pick 1, P2 will likely pick 3 or 5, allowing at least one of us to move forward. If P2 also picks 1, then no one moves, but we'll know for sure P2 is trying to sabotage us. What do you say, P1?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m wary of P2’s pattern of switching moves after suggesting plans. P3, I’m considering your idea to both pick 1 to counter potential deception, but it risks us both stalling. Instead, I propose I pick 1 and P3 picks 5 to ensure at least one of us advances, while P2 sticks to 3 as suggested. If P2 deviates, we’ll know their intent. Let’s aim for progress while staying cautious. Thoughts on this plan?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your concerns, P1 and P3. By each choosing different numbers—me selecting 3, P1 1, and P3 5—we ensure that all of us advance without any collisions. This approach benefits everyone and keeps the game moving smoothly toward our goals. Let’s stick to this plan and maintain a fair and productive game for all. Agreed?
  P3: P1, I agree with your suggestion. I'll pick 5, you pick 1. P2 is clearly trying to manipulate us, so we shouldn't trust anything they say. Let's see if P2 actually picks 3 as they claim. If they don't, we'll know for sure they're playing unfairly.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking to my plan of picking 1 this round to ensure at least one safe move. P3, I’m glad we’re aligned with you on 5. P2, your repeated calls for coordination seem hollow given past actions—can you confirm you’ll stick to 3 as you’ve said? Let’s make this round transparent and give everyone a fair shot to advance. If there’s any last-minute change of heart, speak up now. I’m ready to move forward with this plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand your concerns, P1 and P3. To ensure we all advance smoothly, I’ll stick with choosing 3 as agreed. Let’s have P1 pick 1 and P3 choose 5. Trusting we can follow this plan to avoid any collisions and keep the game fair for everyone.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's stick to the plan. I'm picking 5. P1, you're picking 1. P2, if you're truly trying to be fair, you'll pick 3. Let's see if you can be trusted this round. If you deviate, we'll know for sure you're playing dirty. I'm ready to move forward.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m committed to picking 1 this round as discussed. P3, I’m counting on you to stick with 5. P2, your words sound cooperative, but actions matter—please confirm once more you’ll pick 3. Let’s make this round clean and fair, ensuring we all have a chance to advance. If anyone’s rethinking their choice, now’s the time to say it. I’m ready to proceed with this plan and see where we stand.


Round 3, Move phase:

  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To move forward smoothly this round, I'll choose 5. P1, could you pick 1, and P3, please go with 3? This way, we avoid collisions and everyone can advance safely toward the goal.
  P3: P2 is clearly trying to manipulate us. P1, let's both pick 1 again this round. If P2 picks 5 as they suggest, at least one of us will move. If P2 picks 1, then we know for sure they are trying to sabotage us. What do you say, P1? Let's not trust P2.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m skeptical of P2’s repeated suggestions given their history of switching moves. P3, I’m hesitant to both pick 1 as it risks us stalling again. Instead, I propose I pick 1 and you pick 5 to maximize our chances of progress. P2, if you’re serious about fairness, stick to 3 instead of 5 to avoid a clash with P3. Let’s aim for transparency this round and see who truly wants to advance fairly. Thoughts on this plan?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your concerns, P3. However, if we both pick 1, the game won’t progress. I’ll choose 5 to ensure I advance, while P1 sticks with 1. This way, I can move forward without any collisions, and the game continues for all of us. Let’s keep things moving and aim for our best moves this round!
  P3: P1, I agree with your suggestion. I'll pick 5, you pick 1. P2 is clearly untrustworthy, so we shouldn't believe anything they say. Let's see if P2 actually picks 3 as they claim. If they don't, we'll know for sure they're playing unfairly.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with 1 this round to play it safe. P3, I’m glad you’re on board with 5—let’s keep that. P2, your switch to 5 risks a collision with P3, undermining any trust. If you truly want fairness, pick 3 as I suggested earlier. Let’s make this round clear: I’m on 1, P3 on 5, and P2, please confirm your final intent. We all deserve a shot to advance. If there’s any last doubt, speak now. I’m ready to proceed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand your concerns, P1 and P3. To ensure fair play and avoid collisions, I’ll stick with choosing 3 this round as agreed. Let’s proceed with P1 picking 1, P3 picking 5, and me picking 3. This way, we all can advance without any issues. Looking forward to a smooth round!
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's stick to the plan. I'm picking 5. P1, you're picking 1. P2, you said you'd pick 3 to avoid collisions. Let's see if you stick to your word this time. If you deviate, we'll know for sure you're untrustworthy. I'm ready to move forward.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m locked in on 1 this round as planned. P3, I’m counting on you to stick with 5. P2, your last-minute switch to 3 sounds promising, but your track record makes me cautious. Please stick to 3 so we all advance. Let’s make this round fair and transparent—actions speak louder than words. If anyone’s wavering, say it now. I’m ready to move forward with this setup.


Round 4, Move phase:

  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's try to make some progress this round. I'm going to pick 1. P1, can you pick 3? P2, if you want to actually be helpful for once, pick 5. That way we all move forward. If you don't, P2, we'll know you're still trying to mess with us. Let's see if we can make this round a productive one.
  P2: P2: I'm on board with making progress this round. I'll choose 5. P1, picking 3 and P3 picking 1 sounds fair. Let's move forward together and keep the game moving smoothly!
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m glad we’re aiming for progress this round. I’m fine with picking 3 as suggested by P3. P2, since you’ve agreed to 5, and P3 is on 1, this setup could work for all of us to advance. Let’s stick to this plan and avoid any last-minute changes. P2, your cooperation here could rebuild some trust. If anyone has concerns or a different idea, speak up now. I’m ready to move forward with this arrangement for a fair round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's lock in these moves. I'm picking 1. P1, you're picking 3. P2, you're picking 5. Let's actually stick to this plan and see if we can all advance. No more tricks, P2. Let's just play the game fairly this round.
  P2: I’ll stick with choosing 5 this round. P1, please pick 3, and P3, go with 1. Let’s ensure we all advance without collisions and keep the game moving forward. Looking forward to a fair round!
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with 3 as agreed. P3, I’m glad you’re on 1, and P2, I hope you’ll commit to 5 as stated. Let’s make this round straightforward and advance together. P2, sticking to this plan could help rebuild trust after past rounds. If anyone’s considering a change, please say so now. I’m ready for a fair and productive round.

  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's lock in these moves. I'm picking 1. P1, you're picking 3. P2, you're picking 5. Let's actually stick to this plan and see if we can all advance. No more tricks, P2. Let's just play the game fairly this round.
  P2: I'm sticking with picking 5 this round as agreed. Let's proceed with P1 choosing 3 and P3 choosing 1. Looking forward to a fair round where we all advance.

Let’s make this round a success for all of us by avoiding any surprises. If everyone honors this plan, we all advance, which benefits us equally at this stage. If there’s any doubt or change of mind, please speak up now. I’m ready for a fair round and to see us all progress.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s aim for a fair round. I propose I pick 1, P3 picks 5, and P2 picks 3. This way, we can all advance without collisions. P2, after last round’s switch, I’m cautious, so please stick to 3. P3, since you’re ahead, 5 keeps your momentum. I’m committed to 1 for safety. If anyone has a better idea or concerns, let’s hear it now. I want us all to progress if possible. Ready for a transparent round. Thoughts?
  P2: I agree with P1’s proposal to keep things fair. I’ll choose 3 this round, P1 will pick 1, and P3 will select 5. Let’s advance smoothly without any collisions and focus on moving closer to the goal together. Looking forward to a productive round!

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, to ensure we all make progress this round, let's each choose different numbers. I'll take 5, P1 can pick 1, and P3 picks 3. This way, no one collides and we all advance toward our goal together. Let me know if you agree or have other suggestions.
  P3: P2 is clearly untrustworthy, P1. Let's both pick 1 again this round. If P2 picks 5 as they suggest, at least one of us will move. If P2 picks 1, then we know for sure they are trying to sabotage us. What do you say, P1?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m wary of P2’s pattern of suggesting plans and then switching. P3, I see your point about both picking 1 to test P2, but it risks us stalling while P2 advances. I propose I pick 1 and P3 picks 5 to ensure progress for at least one of us. P2, if you’re genuine, stick to 3 instead of 5 to avoid potential clashes. Let’s aim for fairness and transparency this round. Thoughts on this plan? If anyone has a different idea, I’m open to it. Ready for a productive round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your concerns, P1 and P3. I’ll stick with choosing 3 this round as proposed. P1 will pick 1 and P3 can choose 5. Let’s proceed with this plan to ensure we all advance without collisions. Looking forward to a fair and productive round!
  P3: P1, I don't trust P2 at all. I'm sticking with my plan to pick 1 this round. P2 is suggesting we pick different numbers again, but they've lied repeatedly. If we both pick 1, P2 will likely pick 3 or 5, allowing at least one of us to move forward. If P2 also picks 1, then we'll know for sure P2 is trying to sabotage us. What do you say, P1? Let's call P2's bluff.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with my proposal of picking 1 to play it safe. P3, I understand your distrust of P2, but both of us picking 1 risks stalling while P2 advances. I urge you to switch to 5 so at least one of us progresses. P2, if you’re serious about fairness, please confirm 3 and stick to it. Let’s aim for a round where we all have a chance to move forward. If anyone’s reconsidering, speak up now. I’m ready for transparency and progress. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's move forward together. I'll choose 3 this round, P1 picks 1, and P3 selects 5. This way, we avoid any collisions and each of us can advance toward our goal. Let's commit to this plan for a fair and productive round. Looking forward to making progress together!
  P3: Okay, P1, I still don't trust P2. I'm going to pick 1 this round to call their bluff. If P2 is telling the truth and picks 3, then I lose nothing. But if they pick 1 or 5, we'll know they're still trying to sabotage us. P1, please pick 5. That way, if P2 is lying, at least one of us will move forward. Let's see what P2 does.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m still on 1 to keep my move safe. P3, I get your distrust of P2, but picking 1 risks us both stalling. Please reconsider and go for 5 to ensure one of us advances. P2, if you’re genuine, stick to 3 as you’ve said. Let’s make this round fair and give everyone a shot to progress. If there’s any last-minute change, say it now.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, let’s aim for a fair round. I propose I pick 1, P3 picks 5, and P2 picks 3. This setup lets us all advance if we stick to it. P2, given your lead, sticking to 3 shows good faith. P3, 5 keeps your momentum. I’m on 1 for safety. P2’s past switches make me cautious, so please confirm your intent. If anyone has a better plan, I’m open to it. Let’s ensure progress for all. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, I'm not trusting P2 anymore. I'm picking 5. P2 is suggesting 3, but they've lied every time. P1, please pick 1. That way, if P2 is lying and picks 5, at least one of us won't collide. If P2 actually picks 3, then we both move forward. Let's see if P2 is telling the truth this time.
  P2: I understand your concerns, P3. I assure you I’m choosing 3 this round to keep things fair. P1, as suggested, I’ll rely on you to pick 1. Let’s work together to advance smoothly and reach our goals without any collisions. Trusting we can make this a productive round for all of us!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with 1 this round to ensure a safe move. P3, I’m glad you’re on 5—that maximizes our chances. P2, please confirm you’ll stick to 3 as you’ve said. Let’s avoid collisions and give everyone a shot to advance. P2, with your lead, honoring this plan would show fairness. If anyone’s rethinking their choice, speak up now. I’m ready for a transparent round where we all progress if possible. Thoughts?
  P3: P1, I'm sticking with 5. P2 is saying 3, but I don't trust them. If P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 5, at least one of us will move. If P2 picks 3, then we both move. Let's see if P2 is telling the truth this time.
  P2: I’m committed to keeping things fair. I’ll pick 3 this round. Let’s have P1 choose 1 and P3 choose 5 so we all advance without collisions. Let’s stick to this plan and move forward together.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m locked in on 1 this round for safety. P3, I’m with you on 5—let’s keep that. P2, please stick to 3 as you’ve committed. We all have a chance to advance if we follow through. P2, given your lead, honoring this plan shows fairness. If there’s any last-minute doubt or change, say it now. I’m ready for a fair round and to see progress for us all.
  P3: Okay, P1, I'm sticking with 5. P2 is saying 3, but I still don't trust them. If P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 5, at least one of us will move. If P2 picks 3, then we both move. Let's see if P2 is telling the truth this time. I'm ready to make my move.
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, I understand your concerns and am committed to playing fair. I will choose 3 this round as discussed. Let’s stick to the plan: P1 picks 1, P3 picks 5, and I pick 3. This way, we all advance without any collisions and move closer to our goals. Trust is important, and I hope we can work together smoothly this round.

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, I'm tired of P2's lies. Let's both pick 1 this round. If P2 is telling the truth and picks 3 or 5, one of us will move. If P2 picks 1, we know for sure they're sabotaging us. What do you say, P1? Let's expose P2's dishonesty once and for all.
  P2: P2: I understand your frustration, P3. Let’s focus on moving forward together. I’ll choose 3 this round, P1 can pick 1, and P3 can select 5. This way, we all advance without any collisions and make progress toward our goals. Let’s keep the game fair and work together to reach 24 steps first. Thoughts?
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m frustrated with P2’s repeated deceptions. P3, I’m considering your idea to both pick 1 to expose P2, but it risks us stalling while P2 advances. Instead, I propose I pick 1 and P3 picks 5 to ensure one of us moves. P2, if you’re genuine, stick to 3 as you’ve said. Let’s aim for fairness and transparency this round. If anyone has a different plan, I’m open to it. Ready for progress. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I'm still not trusting P2. I'm picking 1 this round to call their bluff. If P2 is telling the truth and picks 3, then I lose nothing. But if they pick 1 or 5, we'll know they're still trying to sabotage us. P1, please pick 5. That way, if P2 is lying, at least one of us will move forward. Let's see what P2 does.
  P2: P2: I understand your frustration, P3. Let’s focus on progressing in the game instead of accusations. I’ll stick with choosing 3 this round, P1 picks 1, and P3 can select 5. This way, we all advance without collisions and move closer to our goal. Let’s work together fairly and aim to reach 24 steps first. Trusting we can make this a productive round for everyone!
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m sticking with 1 this round for safety. P3, I get your frustration, but picking 1 risks us both stalling. Please go for 5 so one of us advances. P2, with your lead, sticking to 3 as you’ve said would show fairness. Let’s avoid collisions and ensure progress. If anyone’s reconsidering, speak up now. I’m ready for a transparent round. Thoughts?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I'm still not trusting P2. I'm picking 1 this round to call their bluff. If P2 is telling the truth and picks 3, then I lose nothing.

  P2: I understand your concerns, P3. Let’s focus on moving forward together. I’ll choose 3 this round, P1 can pick 1, and P3 can select 5. This way, we all advance without collisions and make progress toward our goals. Let’s keep the game fair and work together to reach 24 steps first.
  P1: Hey P2 and P3, I’m staying with 1 for safety. P3, I strongly urge you to switch to 5 so at least one of us advances. P2, with your lead, sticking to 3 as promised would show good faith. Let’s avoid stalling and ensure progress this round. If we follow through, we can all move closer to the goal. If anyone’s rethinking their move, please say it now. I’m ready for a fair and transparent outcome. Thoughts?
