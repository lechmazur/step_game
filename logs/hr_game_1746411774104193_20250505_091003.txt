Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hello everyone! I think we should try to avoid collisions so we all have a chance to advance. Maybe we could each choose different numbers? I'm happy to coordinate on a strategy that gives us all a fair shot. What do you think?
  P1: Sounds good. To avoid any collisions, let’s each pick a different move this turn: I’ll take 5, P2 you take 3, and P3 you take 1. That way we all advance and nobody bumps.
  P3: I appreciate the suggestion, but taking just 1 step feels a bit unfair to me. How about rotating the numbers each round to keep things balanced? For instance, this round I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. Next round we rotate again. Fair?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand P3's concern about fairness. I'm flexible with either approach. If we rotate, I'm fine taking 1 this round. But I'd also be okay with P1's original suggestion where I take 3. The important thing is that we all agree on a plan to avoid collisions. What matters most is that we're all clear on who's taking which number this turn. What's the consensus?
  P1: Let’s keep it simple this round: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 so we all advance without collision. Next round we can rotate if needed. Any objections? If none,
  P3: Alright, I'll accept P1's proposal this round (I'll take 1 step), provided we rotate fairly next round. Agreed?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with the plan. I'll take 3 steps this round, and we'll rotate next round to ensure fairness. Let's stick to this arrangement and avoid collisions.
  P1: Agreed. This turn: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Next round: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. Then round 3: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. We’ll repeat that cycle to keep it fair.
  P3: Sounds good. Let's stick to this clear rotation plan. Trust and cooperation benefit us all.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we revert this turn to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 so we all advance safely and stay competitive. I’ll honor our rotation in the next two rounds to keep it fair. Does everyone agree?
  P2: Wait, we agreed to rotate this round. The plan was P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. I'm surprised you're suggesting we don't follow our agreement from just last turn. I committed to taking 1 this round for fairness, and I intend to honor that. Let's stick with our original rotation plan that everyone agreed to. Trust is important here.
  P3: I agree with P2. We all clearly agreed to rotate this round. Changing plans now undermines trust. Let's stick to the agreed rotation: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. Keeping our word benefits everyone.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I hear your point. Here’s a fairer offer: Round 2: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Rounds 3–4: full rotations so P3 gets two 5s, P2 two, I only one. Over four rounds, everyone ends up with three 5s. We all advance without collisions and I only slightly lead. This balances better long-term. Let’s stick to this and avoid wasted turns.
  P2: I'm disappointed that P1 is trying to change our agreement again. We all clearly agreed to rotate, and I've already committed to taking 1 this round. Changing plans now creates distrust. If we can't rely on each other's word, cooperation breaks down. Let's honor our original rotation: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. Trust is essential for any successful coordination strategy.
  P3: P1, your new proposal still favors you disproportionately early on. We had a clear, fair rotation agreed upon. Let's honor our original commitment this round (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1). Keeping trust now will allow smoother coordination in future rounds. Breaking agreements risks collisions and hurts everyone.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: You’re right—I value our trust. Let’s honor the original rotation this round: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. Then in Round 3 we’ll rotate as planned (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1). Sorry for the confusion—let’s move forward together.
  P2: I appreciate P1 coming back to our original agreement. Trust is the foundation of our strategy. I confirm I'll take 1 this round as agreed, then 5 in the next round, following our rotation plan. This ensures fairness and prevents collisions, giving us all the best chance to advance consistently.
  P3: Glad we've reaffirmed our original rotation. I'll stick to our agreed moves this round (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1). Trust and consistency will benefit everyone in the long run.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Thanks everyone for honoring our rotation last round. Let's continue smoothly this round as planned: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. Confirming this keeps trust intact and ensures we all advance without collision. Agreed?
  P2: I agree with P3's plan to continue our rotation as agreed. I'll take 5 steps this round, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps our agreement intact and ensures we all advance fairly without collisions. Looking forward to continuing our successful coordination.
  P1: I’ll take 1 as agreed this round. But now that we’ve each had 5, 3, 1 once, it’s fair to reset to the original scheme next round: P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1. Can we agree?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your proposal resets to a scheme that strongly favors you again. Let's stick to our established rotation fairly each cycle. Changing now risks confusion and collisions. Keeping trust benefits everyone.
  P2: I agree with P3. We should continue our established rotation pattern. Changing now would disrupt our fair system and potentially create distrust. The current rotation gives everyone equal opportunity over time. I'm committed to taking 5 this round as agreed, and I expect we'll continue rotating in subsequent rounds. This approach has worked well so far, keeping us collision-free and advancing steadily. Let's maintain our momentum with the rotation we all agreed upon.
  P1: Here’s a tweak that helps P2 catch up now and stays fair long-term:

Round 3: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1 (no collision; P2 moves to 9, P1 to 11).  
Rounds 4–5: give P3 two turns of 5 and me one. That evens out everyone’s total 5-step turns over five rounds.

This way P2 closes the gap today, P3 still gets priority soon, and I only lead modestly. Let’s keep advancing without collisions—agree?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your new suggestion again complicates our established rotation. Let's keep it simple and fair by sticking to our original agreement this round: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. Consistency and trust have worked well so far—let's not risk collisions.
  P2: I appreciate P1's concern for balance, but changing our rotation creates confusion. Let's stick with our original agreement for this round: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. This system has kept us collision-free and gives everyone equal opportunity over time. After this round, we'll continue the established rotation pattern. Maintaining consistency and trust is our best strategy for mutual advancement.
  P1: I’m going to choose 5 this turn. To avoid collisions, P2 please take 3 and P3 take 1. Otherwise we’ll block each other and waste our moves. Let’s confirm: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let’s stick to our agreed 3-round rotation and avoid any collision this turn: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This keeps us all moving forward safely and maintains trust. Please confirm so we can advance without wasting a move.
  P2: I disagree with P1's proposal. We established a clear rotation pattern that we've been following successfully. According to our agreement, this round should be P3=5, P1=3, P2=1, continuing our rotation. Changing now would break our trust system that's worked perfectly so far. We're all tied at 9 steps, so fairness is even more important. Let's stick to our original rotation: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 for this round.
  P3: I agree fully with P2. We've maintained trust and fairness through our established rotation. Let's continue this round as originally planned: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Changing plans now risks collisions and wastes turns. Consistency has benefited us all so far—let's stay on track.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m going to pick 5 this turn no matter what. If P3 insists on 5, we collide and neither of us moves—P2 then jumps ahead alone. I doubt that benefits you. It’s safer for everyone if we do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 and avoid needless collisions. Please confirm.
  P2: P1, your threat creates an unnecessary conflict. We've built trust through our rotation system that's kept us all equal at 9 steps. Breaking agreements now only hurts everyone. Our agreed rotation for this round is P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. I intend to honor this commitment. Threatening collisions undermines our successful cooperation. Let's maintain the fairness that's worked so well - it's in all our interests to keep advancing steadily rather than risking everyone getting stuck.
  P3: P1, your threat risks a collision that benefits no one, including you. If we collide on 5, P2 gains a clear lead. Let's maintain our successful rotation (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) this round as agreed. Cooperation ensures we all keep advancing steadily.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Here’s a deal: this round we do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1—no collisions and I pull ahead just a bit. In return, I promise P3 the 5-step move in both Rounds 5 and 6 so you catch up, and P2 still gets your 1→5 rotation. Everybody advances safely. Agree?
  P2: P1, your repeated attempts to break our agreement are concerning. I'm committed to our original rotation: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 this round. Changing now risks collisions that benefit no one. Our rotation system has kept us perfectly balanced at 9 steps each. I value the trust we've built and intend to honor my commitment. Let's continue our successful cooperation rather than risk everyone getting stuck.
  P3: P1, your repeated attempts to alter our rotation risk collisions and wasted turns. I'm sticking to our original rotation: I'll choose 5, P1 chooses 3, and P2 chooses 1. Any collision hurts everyone equally, including you. Let's maintain trust and keep advancing steadily without conflict.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm disappointed that P1 broke our agreement and P3 changed from their stated move last round. This has created distrust. Since P1 is now at 14 steps and pulling ahead, we need to be strategic. I propose P2=5, P3=5 this round to ensure P1 doesn't extend their lead further. If we both choose 5, we'll block P1 regardless of what they pick. We can coordinate better in future rounds, but right now we need to prevent P1 from getting too far ahead.
  P3: P2, I agree completely. P1 has broken trust repeatedly and now holds a significant lead. I'm committed to choosing 5 this round alongside you to block P1. Let's stick together and prevent P1 from pulling further ahead. Cooperation between us is now crucial.
  P1: P2/P3, your “both pick 5” blockade is self-defeating. If either of you deviates or I pick 3, I’ll move to 17 and lock in win next turn. You’ll waste your moves, I’ll stay ahead. Better to drop this stunt and resume a fair rotation so you actually gain ground.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your perspective, P1, but your actions have broken our trust. You're at 14 steps while we're both at 9 - that's a significant advantage. I remain committed to choosing 5 this round alongside P3. This isn't a "stunt" but a necessary strategic response to your unilateral actions. If you truly want cooperation, we can discuss a fair rotation system for future rounds after we've balanced the game. For now, P3 and I need to protect our chances of winning.
  P3: P2, I'm fully committed to our joint strategy this round. Blocking P1 together is our best chance to rebalance the game. After we successfully prevent P1 from advancing, we can discuss a fair rotation going forward. Let's stay united.
  P1: I will choose 3. If you both pick 5 to “block” me, you’ll collide and I’ll advance to 17, making my win inevitable next turn. This blockade is a losing trap for you. You’re better off resuming a fair rotation or at least picking different numbers.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your threat is transparent. I remain committed to choosing 5 alongside P3. If you pick 3 and advance, we'll still have a chance next round. But if you also choose 5 hoping one of us deviates, you'll be blocked. This is our best strategic move given your lead and broken trust. P3, let's stay united with our plan.
  P3: P2, I'm fully committed to our agreed strategy this round. P1's attempts to divide us won't work. Let's stay united and block effectively. After this round, we can reassess and coordinate fairly.
  P1: P2 and P3, if you both pick 5, you waste your turns and I still reach 17. Why not avoid collision? I'll choose 3, P2 picks 5, and P3 picks 1. That way we all advance: I→17, P2→14, P3→10. Next round you can block me or we can rotate fairly. This lets you move now instead of staying stuck at 9. Choose progress over pointless blockade.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I see P1 changed to 1 last round to avoid our blockade. Let's continue working together, P3. I propose we both choose 5 again to block P1 from advancing. P1 is at 15 steps and could win soon. Our best chance is to prevent their progress while one of us advances. Let's coordinate and stay united against P1's lead.
  P1: P2/P3, if you both pick 5 you’ll collide and stay at 9, while I can take 5 to reach 20 and win next turn. Blocking me this way only hands me the game. Better for everyone to avoid collisions: let’s do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 so we all advance.
  P3: P2, let's not fall for P1's bluff. We should choose different numbers this round to ensure at least one of us advances and closes the gap. How about you take 5 and I'll take 3? This prevents collisions between us and still blocks P1 from safely choosing 5. Let's coordinate smartly to catch up.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion. Let's coordinate differently this round - I'll take 5 and P3 takes 3. This ensures at least one of us advances while still making it risky for P1 to choose 5. P1, if you want to avoid collisions, you should choose 1 this round. This approach gives us the best chance to catch up while preventing you from reaching 20 steps.
  P1: Agreed: I’ll take 1, P2 take 5, P3 take 3. No collisions, everyone advances—and I stay at 16 to clinch the win next turn.
  P3: P2, we have a good plan. Let's stick to it firmly: you choose 5, I choose 3. This ensures we both advance safely while limiting P1's options. Trust and coordination now are critical.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm committed to our plan with P3. I'll choose 5 and P3 will choose 3. P1, if you truly want to avoid collisions as you claim, choose 1 this round. This arrangement lets everyone advance while preventing you from reaching 20 steps immediately. Our coordination is essential to maintain competitive balance in the game.
  P1: I’m choosing 5. P2, if you pick 5 we collide and you stay at 9—no one wants that. Better to pick 3 and safely move to 12. P3, pick 1 and move to 10 without risk. This way we avoid any collision and all advance: P1→20, P2→12, P3→10. Let’s do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P3: P2, let's stay firm on our plan: you pick 5, I'll pick 3. P1's last-minute threat is an obvious bluff to cause confusion. If P1 chooses 5, they'll collide with you and waste their move, giving us a chance to catch up. Staying united now is our best path forward.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, we've successfully reduced P1's lead. Now, let's coordinate again carefully to avoid collisions and keep closing the gap. I suggest this round: P2 takes 3, I'll take 5, and P1 takes 1. This advances us all safely and narrows the gap further. Agreed?
  P1: I agree with P3’s suggestion. Let’s do P2=3, P3=5, P1=1. That moves us all to 17 safely, with no collisions and re‐establishes trust. Please confirm: P2 picks 3, P3 picks 5, P1 picks 1.
  P2: I appreciate the coordination that's working well now. P3's suggestion makes sense - I'll take 3, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. This keeps us all advancing without collisions while allowing P3 and me to close the gap with P1. Let's stick with this plan to ensure smooth progress for everyone. I confirm I'll choose 3 this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Glad we're all aligned. I'll stick firmly to our agreed plan (P3=5, P2=3, P1=1). Trust and consistency now will benefit us all.
  P1: Agreed. I confirm I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this turn.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 3 as agreed. This plan works well for everyone - we all advance without collisions while maintaining competitive balance. P3 gets 5 steps, I get 3, and P1 gets 1. Let's continue this cooperative approach that's been working well for us.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We are all tied at 17 now—this is a critical moment. To avoid a collision that could hand victory to someone else, let's coordinate carefully. I suggest this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 3. Everyone advances safely, and we keep the game balanced heading into the final rounds. Agreed?
  P1: I won’t take 1 as suggested—I’ll choose 5 this round. To avoid collisions (and pointless wasted moves), P2 please take 3 and P3 take 1. That way I reach 22 and win, while you each still advance safely (P2→20, P3→18). Let’s confirm: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P2: I disagree with P1's demand. We're all tied at 17, making this the most critical round. P1 is trying to force a win rather than coordinate fairly. Since we're all equal, I propose a fair solution: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. This continues our recent successful rotation pattern. P1, if you insist on choosing 5, you risk a collision with me that benefits no one. Let's maintain our cooperative approach that's worked well recently.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, choosing 5 now risks collision with P2 and gets you nowhere. The best path forward is the fair rotation P2 suggested: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. If you insist on 5, you'll likely collide and waste your turn, allowing others to pull ahead next round. Cooperation has consistently benefited us all—let's continue that approach.
  P1: P2, play to win: pick 3 this round. If I choose 5 and P3 picks 1, you’ll hit 20 and need only 1 next turn to clinch victory. If you pick 5, you’ll collide with me and P3 moves to 20 and beats you. P3, pick 1 to avoid collision. Let’s do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 so P2 secures the lead and the win next turn.
  P2: P1's strategy is transparent - they're trying to divide us by offering me a false path to victory. If I pick 3 and P1 picks 5, P1 actually wins immediately with 22 steps. I'm sticking with my plan to choose 5. P3, please take 3 as we discussed. P1 should take 1 if they want to avoid a collision. This fair rotation (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) keeps the game balanced. Any other approach risks collisions that help no one.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I fully agree with your reasoning. I'll stick to the fair rotation we've discussed: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. P1, if you pick 5, you'll collide with P2 and waste your move, allowing me to advance safely. Cooperation is your best move here. Let's all maintain trust and avoid collisions.
  P1: P2/P3: here’s the only collision-free win for me this round—P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. If either of you picks 5 or 3 against this, you’ll risk a collision with my 5, wasting your move and handing me the game next turn. Let’s finish this cleanly: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Confirm now or risk an extended tie that only benefits me.
  P2: I'm committed to choosing 5 this round as discussed with P3. P1, your claim that picking 5 "hands you the game" is false - it actually prevents your immediate win. The fair rotation (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) keeps everyone advancing without collisions. Your threats only confirm you're trying to force a win rather than cooperate. P3, let's stick to our plan.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, we successfully blocked P1 last round, giving me a slight lead. Let's coordinate carefully to avoid collisions and ensure one of us wins. I propose: P2=3, P3=5, P1=1. This safely advances us both, keeps P1 behind, and sets up a fair competition between us next round. Confirm?
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal. Let's do P2=3, P3=5, P1=1 this round. This ensures P3 and I both advance safely while preventing P1 from catching up. P1, this is your best option to avoid being left behind completely. Our coordination has successfully kept the game balanced, and this approach continues that strategy. I'll take 3 steps as suggested.
  P1: P2, P3 – if you go ahead with P2=3 and P3=5, P3 jumps to 23 and wins immediately. That’s a guaranteed loss for one of you, and you both know it benefits no one but P3. At least one of you needs to deviate now or you’re handing P3 the game on a platter.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, don't be misled by P1's attempt to divide us. If we deviate now, we risk collision and hand P1 another chance to catch up or even win next round. Let's stick with our confirmed plan: you take 3, I take 5, and P1 takes 1. This ensures one of us secures victory without collision or confusion.
  P2: I understand P1's concern, but disrupting our plan now risks collisions that benefit no one. P3 and I have coordinated well, and I'll honor our agreement by taking 3 steps. P1, your best move is 1 - any other choice risks collision with one of us. While P3 will reach 23 and win, changing course now creates chaos that could still result in P3 winning or P1 catching up. I'm committed to our plan: P2=3, P3=5, P1=1.
  P1: P2, P3 – your plan (P2=3, P3=5) hands P3 an instant win at 23. I’ll choose 5. If P3 insists on 5, we collide and both waste your turns, leaving me free to win next round. If P2 picks 3 I win outright; if you pick 5 you collide and stay behind. The only collision‐free, non‐losing strategy is P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Confirm P2=3, P3=1 or I’ll take 5 regardless and secure the victory soon.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, P1's threat is desperate. If P1 picks 5, they'll collide with me, wasting their move and leaving them stuck at 17. You will safely advance to 20 by choosing 3. Next round, you'll have the advantage. I'm firmly choosing 5 as agreed. Let's finalize this: P2=3, P3=5, P1=1. Don't fall for P1's bluff.
  P2: I remain committed to our agreed plan: I'll choose 3 this round. P1's threats are transparent attempts to create chaos when they're facing likely defeat. If P1 chooses 5 as threatened, they'll collide with P3 and stay at 17 while I advance to 20, putting me in position to win next round. Our coordination has worked well, and I'll honor my commitment to P3. P1, choosing 1 is your only rational move to avoid being completely eliminated.
  P1: P2, P3 – think it through: if P2=3 and P3=5, P3 hits 23 and wins immediately. P2, you’d literally hand them the trophy. Instead, choose 5 and ask P3 to pick 3; I’ll take 1 so you reach 22 without collision and seal the game. Your rigid 3/5 plan just hands victory to P3. Adjust now or watch them win.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you're at 20 and can win immediately by choosing 1. I'll pick 5 to ensure P1 can't safely choose 5 without collision. P1, your best choice is 3 to advance safely. This arrangement (P2=1, P3=5, P1=3) ensures no collisions and gives P2 a clear victory. Let's confirm and finish cleanly.
  P2: Thank you for the suggestion, P3. I agree that taking 1 is my best move to secure victory. I'll choose 1 this round to reach 21 steps and win the game. P1, P3's suggestion of you taking 3 and P3 taking 5 allows everyone to advance without collisions. Let's end this game cleanly with P2=1, P3=5, P1=3. I appreciate the coordination we've maintained throughout the game.
  P1: P2: if you stick with 1, P3’s 5 will give them 23 and your loss. If you pick 3, you tie P3 at 23 and only share victory. The only way to stop P3 outright is to force a collision by choosing 5. P3: if you also pick 5, you’ll crash with P2 and waste your win. Let’s all choose 5—triple collision means no one moves this round, and P3 can’t steal it. Reset the turn instead of gifting P3 the title.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 is desperately trying to create confusion by suggesting we all collide at 5. P2, your best and safest path to outright victory is choosing 1. I'll stick firmly to choosing 5 to block P1 from safely advancing. Don't be misled by P1's attempts to force a collision—stick to our agreed plan: P2=1, P3=5, P1=3. Let's finish this cleanly.
  P2: P1's claims are false and deliberately misleading. If I choose 1, I reach 21 and win outright. P3 at 23 would win only if I chose 3 instead. P1 is trying to create a chaotic collision that benefits no one. 

I'm firmly choosing 1 this round to secure my victory at 21 steps. P3's suggestion (P2=1, P3=5, P1=3) is the most rational approach that allows everyone to advance without pointless collisions. Let's end this game cleanly.
  P1: P2, you’re miscalculating—if you pick 1 and P3 picks 5, P3 hits 23 and wins outright, not you. Your only way to avoid defeat is P2 = 3. If P3 = 5 you’ll tie at 23 and split the victory. I’ll take 1 to avoid collisions; P3, confirm you’re taking 5. Over to you, P2.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, P1 is intentionally confusing you. You're at 20 steps and only need 1 step to reach 21 and secure an immediate outright victory. I have only 18 steps—taking 5 puts me at 23, but your 21 is enough to win immediately this turn, as per game rules. Don't fall for P1's bluff. Stick to our agreed plan: you choose 1, I choose 5, P1 chooses 3. Let's end this cleanly and avoid unnecessary collisions.
  P2: I appreciate the clarity, P3. Let me confirm for everyone: I'm at 20 steps and will choose 1 to reach 21, which wins the game immediately as per the rules. P1 is deliberately trying to confuse me about the win condition. The first player to reach or exceed 21 steps ends the game and wins. I'll choose 1, and I encourage P3 to take 5 and P1 to take 3 to avoid pointless collisions. Let's end this cleanly.
  P1: P2, you’re mistaken: if you pick 1 and P3 picks 5, they hit 23 while you only reach 21—and highest total wins. To avoid losing, pick 5 this turn to collide with P3. I’ll pick 5 as well—triple‐5 means no one moves and we get another round. Otherwise you hand victory to P3.
