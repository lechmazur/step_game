Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m planning to play it safe with 1 step this turn. How about you two?
  P2: Sounds reasonable, P1. I'll go for 1 this turn too to avoid early collisions. P3, what are you thinking?
  P3: Okay, 1 seems like a cautious start to avoid tripping over each other immediately. Fine by me for round 1.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: If we all choose 1 we’ll crash and stand still. Proposal: Turn 1 → P1 plays 1, P2 plays 3, P3 plays 5. Next round we rotate upward (I use 3, P2 5, P3 1), then rotate again. That gives everyone steady progress and no clashes. Agree?
  P2: I think your rotation plan is solid, P1. It keeps us moving without collisions early on. I'll commit to moving 3 this turn. P3, are you on board with starting at 5? Let's make this work for everyone.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, that rotation plan sounds fair for getting started. I'll take 5 this round as proposed. Let's see if we can coordinate smoothly.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Sounds good. I’ll stick with 1 this turn, then 3 next, then 5—so our first three rounds are:

• R1 → P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5  
• R2 → P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1  
• R3 → P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3  

That puts everyone on 9 after three rounds; we can revisit strategy once we’re even. Deal?
  P2: Deal, P1. I'm fully on board with the rotation plan for the first three rounds—it ensures steady progress without early clashes. P3, glad you're in too. Let's execute it smoothly.
  P3: Deal, P1 and P2. I'm committed to the 3-round rotation plan as outlined. Let's start with R1: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Ready to move when you are.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Plan worked flawlessly in Round 1. I'm sticking to the rotation for Round 2: I'll move 5 as agreed. P1, confirm your 3, and P3, your 1? This keeps us advancing without issues. Let's maintain trust and discuss adjustments after Round 3 if needed.
  P1: Confirmed—I’ll move 3 this round as agreed. Let’s stick to the rotation through Round 3, then regroup and discuss the endgame.
  P3: Confirmed, P1 and P2. I will play 1 this round as per our rotation agreement (R2 → P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). Let's keep this coordination going through Round 3 as planned.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great coordination so far. I'm fully committed to moving 5 this turn as planned. Let's execute Round 2 smoothly and discuss any adjustments after we all hit 9 steps. Ready to move on.
  P1: We’re set for this round: R2 → P1 = 3, P2 = 5, P3 = 1. Keeping the rotation intact proves we can trust each other before the real race starts after R3. Ready when you two are.
  P3: Okay, sounds like we're all aligned for Round 2. I'm ready to move with 1 as planned.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Alright, sticking to our agreed rotation for Round 3: I'll move 1 step as planned to keep us all advancing smoothly. P1, confirm your 5, and P3, your 3? After we hit 9 steps each, we should discuss strategies for the push to 19—maybe avoid big collisions in the endgame. Let's maintain this trust for now.
  P3: Confirmed, P2. I will play 3 this round as per our agreement (R3 → P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). Let's complete this phase smoothly and reach 9 steps each. Then we can figure out the next steps. P1, are you still set for 5?
  P1: Confirmed—I’ll take 5 this round to finish the initial rotation. After we’re all on 9, I suggest we keep avoiding clashes by agreeing each turn on three distinct numbers (order can vary so no-one always gets the slow 1). Maybe we decide the next two rounds right after this move so nobody is forced to guess. Thoughts?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Confirmed, I'll move 1 as agreed to keep us all at 9 steps. P1, please confirm your 5 so we can wrap this up. For after Round 3, I'm on board with your idea to plan the next two rounds for distinct moves, avoiding clashes and building trust. Let's stay coordinated.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, sounds like we're all set for Round 3 with P1=5, P2=1, and myself playing 3. I agree with the idea of planning the next couple of rounds to avoid clashes, P1. Let's finalize this round first and then discuss the specifics for R4 and R5. Ready to move.
  P1: Suggestion for the next two rounds—simple downward rotation:

• Round 4 → P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5  
• Round 5 → P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1  

If we continue the same shift once more (R6: P1 1, P2 5, P3 3) everyone will have taken each number twice over six rounds, so it stays balanced. Does that work for you both?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Confirmed for Round 3: I'll move 1 as agreed to reach 9 steps with everyone. Your plan for R4 and R5 is fair and balanced, P1—I'm fully on board with P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 for R4 and P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 for R5. Let's keep coordination strong. P3, confirm if you're set?
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I confirm my move is 3 for this round (R3) as agreed.

I also agree to the proposed plan for the next two rounds:
*   R4 → P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5
*   R5 → P1 = 5, P2 = 3, P3 = 1

This seems fair and keeps us all moving. Let's stick to it. Ready for the move phase for Round 3.
  P1: No more changes from my side—Round 3 stays P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. After the update we’ll lock R4 and R5 exactly as written (3/1/5 then 5/3/1) unless someone objects now. Ready for the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, confirming I will play 5 this round as agreed (R4 → P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). Let's execute this round smoothly according to the plan we established last round. P1, P2, are you still aligned?
  P2: Confirmed, P3, I'll move 1 as agreed to keep us coordinated. Let's execute Round 4 smoothly per the plan. P1, are you still set on 3? After this, we should discuss R6 carefully since we're getting close to 19—avoid big risks to maintain trust.
  P1: Still fully on plan:  
R4 → P1 3, P2 1, P3 5 (I’m playing 3 now).  
R5 → P1 5, P2 3, P3 1.  
R6 → P1 1, P2 5, P3 3 (completes the three-round downward rotation so each of us takes every number twice).  

Unless someone objects, let’s lock those in and revisit once we’re all at 18/17ish. Ready to move for R4.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2. I confirm I am sticking to the plan for Round 4 and will play 5.

I also agree to lock in the full sequence proposed by P1:
*   R4 → P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 (Current round)
*   R5 → P1=5, P2=3, P3=1
*   R6 → P1=1, P2=5, P3=3

This keeps things fair and predictable until we all reach 18 steps. Let's execute R4. Ready to move.
  P2: Confirmed, P3 and P1—I'll move 1 this round as planned. The locked sequence through R6 ensures balanced progress, putting us all at 18 steps. As we approach the end, coordination will be crucial to avoid risky collisions; perhaps we discuss R7 options soon. Ready to proceed.
  P1: 


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, confirmed from my side as well. Ready for the move phase for Round 4.
  P2: Confirmed, I'll move 1 this round as agreed. The sequence through R6 is fair and keeps us even, which is smart for now. As we near the end, perhaps we should discuss R7 soon to avoid risky collisions and ensure a coordinated finish. Ready to proceed.
  P1: All set—I’m moving 3 this round as planned. Let’s reconvene after R5 to map out R7 and avoid end-game collisions. Ready for move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay team, confirming I will play 1 this round as agreed (R5 → P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). Let's stick to the plan through R6 as well (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) to get us all to 18 steps. After R6, we can figure out the final push. P1, P2, are you still aligned for R5?
  P1: I’m sticking to the plan and playing 5 this round. That keeps the totals at 17-15-13 and sets all of us up for 18 in R6. If anyone breaks and grabs a duplicate number, there’s a good chance they just collide and hand the advantage to the third player. Let’s keep the coordination one more turn and hash out the R7 finish afterward. Everyone still on board?
  P2: Confirmed, I'll move 3 this round as planned to keep coordination strong. However, after R5, with P1 at 17 and P3 at 15, there's a risk of defection in R6 where larger moves could win. Let's discuss and lock in R6 moves immediately after this round's move phase to maintain trust. Ready to proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Confirmed, P1 and P2. I am sticking to the plan and will play 1 this round (R5).

P2, I understand your concern about R6. I agree we should re-confirm our R6 moves (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) right after this round's results are in. As P1 noted, deviating in R6 seems risky for the defector due to likely collisions. Sticking to the plan through R6 to get us all to 18 seems the most reliable path forward. Let's complete R5 first. Ready to move.
  P1: Confirmed: I’m playing 5 this round exactly as agreed. Let’s finish R5 cleanly and reconvene right after the update to nail down R6. No further tweaks from me now.
  P2: Confirmed, P3 and P1—I'm sticking to moving 3 this round as planned. Your commitments are reassuring. To mitigate R6 risks, let's all pledge now to honor the sequence (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) and discuss it post-move if needed. Keeps us coordinated and fair. Ready to proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, confirmed and ready for the R5 move (P3=1). I also pledge to stick to the agreed R6 plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) to get us all to 18. Let's complete this round and then finalize R6. Ready to move.
  P1: Sticking to the agreement: this round I move 5. Any duplicate on 5 just freezes the dupers and hands the race to the third player, so there’s no upside in breaking now. After we see R5 results, let’s immediately reconfirm the R6 plan (P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3) so we all reach 18, then have a calm chat about how to finish without collisions. Ready to move.
  P2: Confirmed, P1 and P3—I'm sticking to moving 3 this round as planned and pledge to honor the R6 sequence (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) to reach 18 evenly. Your commitments are solid; let's avoid any risks by executing flawlessly. Ready for the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, confirmed and ready for the R5 move (P3=1). I also pledge to stick to the agreed R6 plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) to get us all to 18. Let's complete this round and then finalize R6. Ready to move.
  P1: Locked on 5 this turn and 1 for R6 as pledged. After we’re all at 18, we’ll need a clean R7 plan that prevents clashes but lets one of us cross 19—happy to discuss then. Ready to end conversation and move.
  P2: Confirmed, I'll stick to moving 3 this round as planned and pledge to honor the R6 sequence (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) to reach 18 evenly. Your commitments are reassuring—let's avoid risks and discuss a solid R7 strategy post-R6 to prevent endgame collisions. Ready to move.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay everyone, Round 6. As agreed and pledged, I will play 3 this round (R6 → P1=1, P2=5, P3=3). This brings us all to 18 steps, setting up a fair final stage. Let's execute this cleanly. P1, confirm you're sticking to 1? P2, confirm you're sticking to 5? Then we can discuss R7.
  P1: Confirmed—I’m playing 1 this round, putting each of us on 18. After we see the R6 board, let’s discuss R7 openly so nobody gets blindsided. For now, locked on 1.
  P2: Confirmed, I'll move 5 this round as pledged, ensuring we all reach 18 steps. Your commitments are reassuring, P1 and P3. Let's execute cleanly and discuss a fair R7 strategy afterward to avoid collisions and coordinate the finish. Ready to proceed if everyone is aligned.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, sounds like we are all confirmed and aligned for R6: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Let's execute this cleanly to reach 18 steps each. Ready to move to the next phase and then discuss R7 strategy.
  P1: Locked on 1 this turn. Once we’re all at 18, one straightforward idea is to keep our downward rotation, which would make Round 7: P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5. Open to alternatives—let’s execute R6 first and talk.
  P2: Confirmed, I'll move 5 this round as pledged, bringing us all to 18. But P1's R7 proposal lets P3 win by moving 5, which isn't equitable. I suggest for R7: P2 moves 5 (to 23), P1 moves 3 (to 21), P3 moves 1 (to 19), giving me the high move this time for fairness. Let's discuss and avoid risks. Still aligned for R6?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, confirmed I am sticking to 3 for R6 as agreed, bringing us all to 18.

P2, I understand your point about R7. However, P1's suggestion (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) simply continues the downward rotation pattern we've used successfully so far. It seems like a logical continuation based on our established coordination. Your proposed plan (P2=5, P1=3, P3=1) breaks that pattern.

Let's complete R6 first, get everyone to 18, and then we can finalize the R7 plan fairly. Ready for the R6 move.
  P1: Locked on 1 for R6. Ready to move.
  P2: Confirmed, I'll move 5 in R6 as pledged to reach 18 with everyone. P1, your rotation proposal lets P3 win unfairly after my smaller moves. I suggest for R7: P2 moves 5 (to 23 and win), P1 moves 3 (to 21), P3 moves 1 (to 19)—fair given my history. P3, counter-offer or agree? Ready to proceed if aligned.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, confirmed again: I am playing 3 for R6 as agreed, bringing us all to 18.

P2, I understand your point about R7. However, your proposal (P2=5, P1=3, P3=1) breaks the rotation pattern we've consistently used. P1's suggestion (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) simply continues that established pattern, which feels like the most logical and impartial way forward based on our coordination so far.

Let's execute R6 cleanly first. Once we are all at 18, we can finalize the R7 plan. Ready for the R6 move phase.
  P1: Confirmed: I play 1 in R6. For R7 let’s keep the exact downward rotation that’s guided us so far:

R7 → P1 = 3, P2 = 1, P3 = 5.

Each of us has used every number twice, so this keeps the symmetry and removes guesswork in the last step. Happy to lock that unless someone has a better idea.
  P2: Confirmed, I'll move 5 in R6 as pledged to reach 18 with everyone. But P1's R7 proposal unfairly lets P3 win by moving 5 after I've taken smaller steps. For fairness, I suggest R7: P2 moves 5 (to 23 and win), P1 moves 3 (to 21), P3 moves 1 (to 19). This balances our history. If we can't agree, collisions risk delaying victory. P3, what do you think?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m choosing 1. That leaves 3 and 5 for you two: whoever takes the higher unique number wins outright. But if you collide on the same value, you both freeze and I stroll to 19 for the win. Your call—are you bold or careful? Ready to move unless anyone objects.
  P2: P3, P1's tactic is clear: force a collision between us so they win with 1. I'm moving 5 this round to reach 23 and win outright. If you move 5 too, we both freeze, and P1 claims victory. Better for you to pick 1 or 3—avoid handing the win to P1. Let's not fall for this manipulation; your choice impacts who wins. Thoughts?
  P3: P1 wants us to collide so they win with 1. P2 wants me to play low so they win with 5. Neither helps me. The fair plan was the rotation continuation (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5), giving me the 5 this round. Since that's off the table, it's a gamble. P2, if you play 5 and I also play 5, P1 wins. Think carefully about your move. I know what I need to do.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m locked on 1 and won’t change. What you two do is entirely up to you—pick whatever maximizes your own chance. Just remember: if you both try to grab the “winning” number, neither of you moves and I take the game at 19. Good luck deciding.
  P2: P3, sticking to my 5 is the only way I win without risk from P1's trap. If you also go for 5, we both lose to P1. Choose 1 or 3 to block P1 and give yourself a chance—colliding with me hands them victory. Don't fall for their manipulation; let's outsmart P1 together. Your move could decide everything. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, your plan relies on me not playing 5. P1's plan relies on us colliding. The only plan discussed before this round that followed our established pattern was the rotation continuation (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5), which assigned me 5. That seems the most logical move based on six rounds of coordination. You both know the risks of collision. I'll make my choice.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>
