Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5 this round. If we follow this pattern, we can all advance without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P2: P3, your plan sounds reasonable, but how do we ensure trust in future rounds? P1, do you agree with this plan for now? Let's keep it simple and stick to this pattern for the first round and see how it goes.
  P1: I appreciate P3's initiative to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. It's a good starting point. P2, I agree that trust in future rounds is a concern. 

To address this, I propose a rotating step pattern that gives each of us a chance to take larger steps at different times. Here's an alternative plan:

- **Round 1:** P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1  
- **Round 2:** P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5  
- **Round 3:** P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3  
- **Round 4:** Repeat Round 1, and so on.  

This way, we can all have turns at taking bigger steps without always favoring one player. What do you think about this approach?  

Let's agree to evaluate after each round to make sure everyone is sticking to the plan. If someone deviates, we can adjust accordingly.  

What's everyone's thoughts on this?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your rotating step pattern proposal is interesting and seems fair. I'm willing to try it for the first few rounds to see how it works. P2, what are your thoughts on P1's plan? If we all agree, let's commit to this pattern and review after each round. If anyone deviates, we'll need to reassess our strategy. Let's aim for a smooth start and see where this takes us.
  P2: P1, your rotating step pattern seems fair and balanced. I'm on board to try it for the first few rounds and see how it goes. Let's stick to this plan and evaluate after each round to ensure everyone is cooperating. If anyone deviates, we can adjust our strategy. P3, are you ready to commit to this plan as well? Let's aim for a smooth start and see how this approach works for us.
  P1: I think the rotating step pattern I proposed earlier is a fair way to proceed. It gives each of us a chance to take larger steps in different rounds, ensuring that no one has an unfair advantage. P2 and P3, what do you think about committing to this pattern for the first few rounds and evaluating after each one? If anyone has concerns or alternative suggestions, now is the time to voice them. Let's aim for a strategy that allows us all to progress efficiently without colliding, and adjust as necessary based on how the game unfolds.
