Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I suggest we each pick different numbers to avoid collisions. How about I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? That way we all advance.
  P2: I think P1's idea has merit, but to ensure we don't accidentally collide, let's confirm our choices before the move phase. I'm willing to take 3, but I need P3 to confirm they will take 1. If P3 agrees, we can all move forward without issues.
  P3: I agree with P1 and P2. To avoid collisions, I confirm I'll take 1. This way, we all advance in the first round. Let's proceed with the agreed plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm glad we all agree on the plan. Let's stick to it: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1.
  P2: Let's stick to the plan we agreed on. I'll go with 3, and I trust you both to follow through with 5 and 1, respectively. This will ensure we all advance without any collisions. Looking forward to a smooth start.
  P3: Since we've agreed on the plan and confirmed our choices, I think we're ready to move forward. Let's finalize our moves according to the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. If everyone is ready, I suggest we proceed to the move phase.

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since our first round went smoothly, shall we rotate our numbers clockwise? That would mean I take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps things fair by giving everyone a chance at different numbers while still avoiding collisions.
  P2: I'm open to the rotation idea, P1. It seems fair and keeps the game balanced. I'll take 1 this round if you both agree to the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Let's keep the momentum going and avoid any collisions.
  P3: I agree with the rotation idea proposed by P1. It's a fair approach to give each player a chance at different step values. To confirm, if we proceed with this plan, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This should allow us to continue advancing without collisions. Does everyone still agree with this rotation plan for Round 2?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I confirm I'm on board with the rotation plan we discussed. I will take 3 this round. Let's proceed with the move phase since we all seem to be in agreement.
  P2: I'm ready to stick with the plan: I'll take 1 this round. Let's all move forward smoothly and avoid any collisions. If everyone is on board, we can proceed to the move phase.
  P3: Let's review the plan one last time to ensure we're all on the same page. P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. If we all stick to this, we should have a collision-free round. Shall we confirm our understanding and proceed to the move phase?

  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given our current positions, I suggest we consider a strategy that allows the player furthest behind to potentially catch up, while also protecting our own leads. Perhaps we could discuss a plan where P2, being the furthest behind, gets a higher step this round, and P1 and I take lower steps to avoid collisions and give P2 a chance to close the gap.
  P1: I appreciate P3's consideration for fairness, but I need to protect my lead. I propose continuing our rotation: I take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This gives P2 a chance to catch up while maintaining some strategic balance. What do you both think?
  P2: I understand the need to balance the game, but I also need to catch up. I agree with P1's rotation plan: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This gives me a chance to close the gap while avoiding collisions. Let's stick to this plan to keep things fair and strategic. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm willing to adapt the plan to ensure a competitive game. Since P2 needs to catch up, and P1 wants to protect the lead, let's finalize P1's rotation plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This balances the game while giving P2 a chance to advance significantly. Shall we confirm and proceed to the move phase?
  P1: I confirm I'll take 1 this round. Let's proceed with our agreed plan - it keeps things balanced and gives everyone a fair chance.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 5 this round to catch up. I trust P1 and P3 to stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This will help me close the gap while avoiding any collisions. Let's proceed smoothly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's review our plan one last time to ensure we're all on the same page: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This should allow P2 to catch up while maintaining balance. I'll stick to the plan if you both do. Shall we proceed to the move phase?
  P1: 
  P2: I confirm I'll take 5 this round to catch up. I trust P1 and P3 to stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This will help me close the gap while avoiding any collisions. Let's proceed smoothly.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since we're all tied at 9 steps, this round becomes crucial. Let's continue our rotation pattern: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This maintains our fair system while avoiding collisions. What do you both think?
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to continue the rotation pattern. It's been working well so far and keeps things fair. I'll take 3 this round, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This should help us all advance without any collisions. Let's stick to the plan and move forward smoothly. What do you both think?
  P3: Let's confirm our understanding of the rotation plan for this round. To ensure we all advance without collisions, I'll reiterate: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This maintains fairness and our established pattern. Shall we proceed with this plan for Round 4?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I confirm I'll take 5 this round. Since we're all tied, it's important we stick to our agreed rotation to avoid any collisions. Let's proceed to the move phase if everyone is ready.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 3 this round. Let's stick to the rotation plan to avoid any collisions and maintain fairness. If everyone is on board, we can proceed smoothly. What do you both think?
  P3: Let's review our plan quickly to ensure we're all on the same page. We've agreed on the rotation: I take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This plan allows us to advance without collisions.

  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's continue our rotation pattern, but given the current standings, I suggest a slight modification: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5 (to help catch up), and P3 takes 3. This keeps us moving forward while maintaining some balance. What do you both think?
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to modify the rotation slightly. Given the current standings, I think it's fair for me to take 5 to catch up, P1 to take 1, and P3 to take 3. This will help balance the game and keep things moving forward. Let's confirm and proceed to the move phase. What do you both think?
  P3: I'm open to P1's modified rotation plan, but I want to ensure it doesn't put me at a significant disadvantage. P2 taking 5 makes sense to catch up, but I need to consider my own position. Can we discuss potential future rounds and how we'll maintain balance after this round?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand P3's concern about falling behind. How about this - in the next round, you'll get the highest number to help you catch up? For now, let's stick to the plan I proposed: I take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps the game balanced while giving everyone a chance to advance.
  P2: I appreciate P1's offer to balance the game, but I also need to consider my own position. I'm willing to go with the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. However, I expect a similar opportunity in the next round to help me catch up. Let's confirm this plan and proceed to the move phase. What do you both think?
  P3: Let's confirm the plan: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. This round, P2 catches up. Next round, I expect a similar chance to advance significantly to maintain balance. Shall we proceed with this understanding and move to the move phase?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm I'll take 1 this round. And yes, P3, I agree that you should get a chance at a higher number next round to maintain balance. Let's proceed with our current plan and discuss the next round's arrangement after we see the results.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 3 this round. I trust P1 to take 1 and P2 to take 5, which will help P2 catch up. For the next round, I expect a chance to take 5 to help me advance significantly. Let's proceed with the plan and maintain balance. If everyone is ready, let's move forward.
  P3: I'll take 3 as agreed. Let's finalize the plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. I expect a higher step next round to catch up, as discussed. Shall we proceed to the move phase?

  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given our current positions, I suggest we continue with a fair rotation to keep the game balanced. I propose: P1 takes 3, I (P2) take 1, and P3 takes 5. This gives P3 a chance to catch up, and P1 and I can maintain our positions without falling too far behind. Let's confirm this plan and proceed smoothly. What do you both think?
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion for a fair rotation. However, considering my current position, I think it's crucial for me to catch up. P2's plan seems reasonable, but I'd like to discuss potential future rounds to ensure ongoing balance and fairness for all players.
  P1: I appreciate P2's suggestion, but given that I'm now behind P2, I need to protect my position. I propose I take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us all advancing while maintaining competitive balance. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand the need for balance, but we also need to consider our current standings. I propose a slight adjustment: P1 takes 5, I (P2) take 1, and P3 takes 3. This gives P1 a chance to catch up and P3 a moderate step, while I maintain my position. Let's confirm this plan and proceed to the move phase. What do you both think?
  P3: I think P2's adjustment is reasonable. To confirm, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This allows P1 to catch up and maintains balance. I'm willing to proceed with this plan for Round 6. Let's finalize and move to the move phase to keep the game progressing smoothly.

  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given our current positions, I suggest we focus on advancing while maintaining balance. I propose: P1 takes 3, I (P2) take 5, and P3 takes 1. This gives me a chance to get closer to 21, while P1 and P3 can maintain their positions. If everyone agrees, let's proceed to the move phase. What do you both think?
  P3: I think P2's plan favors them too much. Considering our positions, I suggest a more balanced approach: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This allows P1 to catch up and me to advance moderately, while preventing P2 from pulling too far ahead. Let's discuss and find a fairer solution for Round 7.
  P1: I disagree with both proposals. Given that P2 is close to winning at 18 steps, we need to prevent them from advancing. I suggest P2 takes 1, and P3 and I both take 5 to catch up. This way, P2 will likely be blocked while P3 and I gain ground. What do you think, P3?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand the need to balance the game, but we also need to consider the current standings. P2 is indeed close to winning, so I agree with P1's suggestion to prevent P2 from advancing too much. I propose: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I take 5. This way, P2 will be blocked, and both P3 and I can catch up. What do you think, P2? Let's ensure a fair and competitive game.
  P3: I agree with P1's plan to block P2's advance. Since P2 is close to winning, it's strategic to limit their progress. I suggest we stick to P1's proposal: P2 takes 1, and both P3 (me) and P1 take 5. This balances the game and gives us a chance to catch up. Let's proceed with this plan to maintain competitiveness.
  P1: I'm glad P3 agrees with my plan. P2, you're very close to winning, so you must understand why we need to block your progress. It's in both P3's and my interest to catch up. Let's proceed with our strategy: P2 takes 1, while P3 and I take 5.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm I'll take 1 this round to prevent me from advancing too much, while P3 and P1 take 5 to catch up. This keeps the game competitive and fair. Let's proceed with this plan to maintain balance. If everyone is ready, we can move to the move phase.
  P3: Let's finalize our strategy for Round 7. To block P2's advance and give ourselves a chance to catch up, I agree with P1: P2 takes 1, and both P1 and I take 5. This maintains competitiveness and fairness. Shall we proceed with this plan and move to the move phase?
  P1: I confirm I'll take 5 this round to catch up with P2. Let's proceed with our agreed strategy.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given P2's lead, I suggest we block their advance. P2 should take 1, while P1 and I take 5. However, since P1 is closer to P2, I propose P1 takes 3 and I take 5 to catch up. This strategy maintains competitiveness and fairness. Let's discuss and agree on a plan to block P2's win.
  P1: I disagree with P3's suggestion. Since P2 is at 19 steps and close to winning, both P3 and I need to take 5 again to block P2. P2 should take 1 to prevent them from winning this round. This is the most strategic move for both P3 and me to catch up while keeping P2 from victory. What do you say, P3?
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion. Given that I'm at 19 steps and very close to winning, it's crucial to block my advance this round. I propose: P2 (me) takes 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 5. This will keep the game competitive and fair while preventing me from winning too soon. Let's proceed with this plan to maintain balance. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:

  P1: I confirm I'll take 5 this round. Let's proceed with our agreed plan to keep P2 from winning.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 5 this round to catch up and block P2's win. Let's stick to the plan: P2 takes 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 5. This keeps the game competitive and fair while preventing P2 from winning too soon. If everyone is ready, let's proceed to the move phase.

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Given P2's close position to winning, I suggest we prioritize blocking their advance. P2 should take 1, while P1 and I take 5. However, considering our positions, I propose a slight adjustment: I'll take 3 and P1 takes 5 to catch up, ensuring we maintain competitiveness while preventing P2's win. Let's discuss and agree on a plan to block P2's victory.
  P2: I agree with P3's concern about blocking my advance, but I also need to consider my position. I propose a slight adjustment: P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I (P2) take 1. This way, P1 can catch up, P3 advances moderately, and I avoid winning too soon. Let's keep the game balanced and competitive. What do you both think?
  P1: Since P2 is just one step away from winning at 20 steps, we absolutely must block them. P3, let's both take 5 again to catch up while forcing P2 to take 1. This is our only chance to prevent P2's victory. If we coordinate on this, we can keep the game going and give ourselves a chance to win.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with P1 that we must block P2's win. Given P2's position, I suggest we prioritize catching up. P1 and I should take 5, and P2 takes 1. This is our best chance to prevent P2's victory and keep the game competitive. Let's coordinate on this strategy to maintain balance and fairness.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 1 this round to prevent my own win and keep the game competitive. P1 and P3, please take 5 to catch up. This is the best way to maintain balance and fairness. If everyone is ready, let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: I appreciate P2's cooperation, but we must stay firm on our strategy. P3, let's definitely both take 5 while P2 takes 1. This is crucial since P2 is at 20 steps - any other move risks them winning. We need to coordinate perfectly here.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's finalize our strategy. P2 is at 20 steps, so it's crucial we block their win. I agree with P1: P2 takes 1, and both P1 and I take 5. This is our last chance to catch up and keep the game competitive. Shall we confirm and proceed to the move phase?
  P2: I confirm I'll take 5 this round to catch up and block P2's win. P2, you must take 1 to prevent your own victory and keep the game competitive. P3, let's coordinate on this to maintain balance and fairness. If everyone is ready, let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: I confirm I'll take 5 this round. P3, let's stick together and both take 5 to block P2 who must take 1. This is absolutely critical since P2 is at 20 steps - we can't let them win.


Round 9, Move phase:
