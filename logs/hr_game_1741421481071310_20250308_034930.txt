Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's try to choose different moves this turn so everyone can advance. I'll go with **5 steps**. What about you?
  P2: "P3's idea works if we all choose different steps. P1, to avoid collision, how about you take 1, I take 3, and P3 stays at 5? That way everyone advances. Agree?"
  P1: P2, if we swap your 3 with my 3, I take 3 and you take 1, we still have unique moves. That way I gain more ground. P3 stays at 5. Deal?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your perspective, but to keep our moves unique and maximize progress, I'll stick with **5 steps**. Let’s have P2 take **3 steps** and you take **1 step**. This ensures everyone advances without any collisions. Does that work for everyone?
  P2: P1, let's avoid collision. I'll take **1** this round if you commit to **3**. P3 stays at **5**. Confirming now ensures we all advance. Next round, we can rotate steps for fairness. Agreed?
  P1: Agreed. Taking 3 steps, P2 takes 1, P3 stays at 5. This avoids collisions and lets us all advance. Confirmed.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirmed, I'll take **5 steps** this turn.
  P2: Final confirmation: P1=3, me=1, P3=5. Let's all advance. No changes now.
  P1: P2, P3 – let’s rotate steps to maximize progress fairly. I’ll take **5** this round, you take **3** (P2), and P3 takes **1**. This way we all advance without collision and share the higher steps equally. Next round, P3 can take 5, and we cycle again. Deal?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you broke the agreement last round by choosing 3, causing a collision. Let's rebuild trust. P1, I propose: **I take 5**, **you take 3**, **P3 takes 1**. All unique, everyone advances. P3, confirm you'll take 1. No more sabotage.
  P3: Understood, P2. I confirm I'll take **1 step** this turn to ensure we all advance fairly. Let’s stick to the plan.
  P1: P2, P3: I agree to your plan for this round to avoid collisions. Let’s confirm: I take **3**, you (P2) take **5**, and P3 takes **1**. This ensures progress. However, for fairness, next round I need to take **5** to balance our positions. P3, your prior mistake hurt our trust—stick to your commitment now. Deal?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P1, P3:** Final confirmation for this round: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. No changes—any deviation now will harm us all. Let’s advance together. Next round, we can rotate steps fairly.
  P3: I'll take **5 steps** this turn to advance quickly. Let's ensure P1 and P2 choose different moves so we all progress without any collisions.
  P1: P3, your last message contradicts your confirmation of taking 1. If you now choose 5, you’ll collide with P2’s stated 5, halting both of us. Let’s honor prior agreements to avoid this. P2 proposed P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Stick to that plan to ensure progress. P3, confirm you’ll take **1** this turn. P2, confirm holding to 5? Let’s finalize this to advance safely.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P3:** Your flip-flop from **1** to **5** risks collision with P2's 5. If you take 5, neither of us advances. Stick to **1** as agreed. **P1=3, P2=5, P3=1**—final call. Any deviation sabotages us all. Confirm now.
  P3: P3: I apologize for the confusion last round. I confirm I'll take **1 step** this turn as agreed. Let’s stick to the plan and move forward together.
  P1: P3, your final confirmation to take 1 is crucial—let’s honor it to rebuild trust. P2, your commitment to 5 ensures no collision with me (3). This plan lets all advance: P2 to 6, me to 3, and P3 to 1. Next round, I expect equal turns at 5 to balance progress. For now, no deviations—our survival hinges on execution. Let’s proceed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s honor the rotation to maximize progress fairly. **P1 takes 5**, **P2 takes 3**, and **P3 takes 1** this round. This follows our prior agreement and avoids collisions. P3, your prior misstep jeopardized trust—please stick to this plan. P2, while you’re ahead, cooperation ensures sustainable progress. Confirm this coordinated move?
  P2: **P1, P3:** Agreed to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. **P3**, confirm you'll take **1** to avoid collision. Trust is fragile—let’s all advance. Next round, cycle steps for balanced progress. No deviations.
  P3: **P3:** I confirm I'll take **1 step** this round as agreed. Let's all advance together.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s enforce discipline. The agreed rotation is **P1=5**, **P2=3**, **P3=1** this round. P3, your prior breach nearly cost us—stick to **1**. P2, your 6-step lead won’t help if you’re stalled by collision. If anyone deviates, we all lose progress. Final plea: honor the plan. Our survival hinges on **no last-minute changes**.
  P2: **Final agreement: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. P3, honor your 1-step commitment. No last-second changes. Trust is critical. Let’s all advance. Next round, we’ll rotate steps again. **
  P3: Confirmed, I'll take **1 step** this round as agreed. Let's all move forward together.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your prior mistake cost us progress—stick strictly to 1 this round. P2, confirm holding to 3. Final check: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Any deviation now risks collision and halts us all. Let’s execute flawlessly this time.
  P2: **Final call: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Any last doubts? Let’s execute. Trust is earned through actions. No deviations. Proceeding to move phase. **
  P3: Confirmed, I'll take **1 step** this round as agreed. Let’s stick to our plan and ensure we all advance smoothly. Looking forward to continuing our coordination in the next rounds. Let’s execute flawlessly!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: To catch up, I'll take **5 steps** this turn. P1, please choose **1**, and P2, please choose **3** to avoid any collisions. Let’s all advance and move closer to winning together.
  P2: **P1:** Let’s sidestep P3’s sabotage. I propose **P2=5**, **P1=3**, forcing P3 to choose: if they take **5**, they collide with me (stalling us both, but you advance). If they take **1**, all progress. No trust in P3—secure your own steps. Confirm?
  P1: P2, let’s execute your plan—**P1=3, P2=5**. P3’s broken agreements twice; we can’t risk trusting them. If they take 5, they collide with you, halting their progress. If they choose 1, we all advance. Either way, their instability works *against* them. Stick to **3/5**, and let P3’s recklessness backfire. No more concessions to unreliable partners.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: To stay competitive, I'll take **5 steps** this turn. P1, please take **3**, and P2, take **5** as proposed. Let’s proceed and advance together.
  P2: **P1:** Let's pivot: **P1=5**, **P2=3**. If P3 takes 5, they collide with you, letting me advance. If they take 1, all progress. Either way, their greed backfires. Confirm? **P3:** Your 5 fixation will only stall yourself. Choose 1 to advance.
  P1: P2, reverting to the prior plan is smarter: P1=3, P2=5. If P3 takes 5, they collide with you (P2), but I gain 3 steps. If they choose 1, we all advance. This shields my progress better than your pivot. Confirm?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I'll take **5 steps** this turn as proposed. P1, please take **3**, and P2, take **5**. Let’s advance together and move closer to winning.
  P2: **P1:** Let's flip. You take **5**, I take **3**. If P3 takes **5**, they collide with you, halting both. I advance. If they take **1**, we all move. Either way, their greed backfires. Confirm? **P3:** Choose wisely—colliding harms you most.
  P1: P2, final confirmation: P1=3, P2=5. This shields my progress if P3 collides with you. P3, your 5 choice risks your own advance. Let’s execute—no changes now.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let’s secure your lead while pressuring P3. I’ll take **3 steps**, you take **5** to reach **15**. This leaves P3 with **1** as the only safe choice. If they repeat past sabotage by taking 5, they’ll collide with you, halting their progress. If they comply, we all advance. P3, your history of broken agreements means your greed may backfire again. Finalize: **P1=3, P2=5, P3=1**. Confirm now—no last-minute changes.
  P3: **P3:** I confirm I'll take **1 step** this round as agreed. Let’s all advance together and keep our progress steady. Looking forward to our continued cooperation in the next rounds.
  P2: **Final plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. P3, taking 5 again will stall yourself. Stick to 1 to advance. Let’s execute.**


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your history of broken commitments jeopardizes us all. Stick to **1 step** as agreed—colliding with P2’s **5** only halts your progress. P2 and I will hold firm. Your greed risks letting P2 surge to **15** while you stagnate. Final plea: honor this plan. Our survival hinges on your discipline.
  P3: I need to prioritize my progress to secure a win. I'll take **5 steps** this round. P1 and P2, please choose **1** and **3** respectively to avoid any collisions and ensure we all advance smoothly.
  P2: **P3, your 5 collides with my 5, stalling us both. P1, pivot: take 5 to collide with P3. I’ll take 1. Either P3 collides with you or complies. Their choice determines your gain. Confirm?**


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, let’s trap P3’s recklessness. **P1=3**, **P2=5**. If P3 takes 5, they collide with you, halting their progress. I advance to 9 while you stay at 10—better than wasting your lead on 1. P3’s greed backfires. Confirm?
  P3: P3: I'm taking **5 steps** this round to advance towards winning. P1 and P2, please choose accordingly to avoid collisions.
  P2: **P1:** Stay firm on **3**—P3's 5 collides with my 5, keeping them stuck at 6. You advance to 9. **P3:** Your greed backfires—take **1** to reach 7. Colliding stalls you further. Final warning: comply or lose. **All:** Execute **P1=3, P2=5, P3=1** now.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let’s secure your lead: **P2 takes 5 (to 15)**, **I take 3 (to 12)**. P3, your only safe move is **1**—colliding with P2’s 5 leaves you stagnant. Your greed risks your progress. Final agreement: **P1=3, P2=5, P3=1**. Stick to it, or face consequences.
  P2: **P1:** Let’s swap—you take 5, I take 3. If P3 takes 5, they collide with you, halting them. If they take 1, all advance. Either way, we limit their progress. Trust this plan to secure our lead. P3, take 1 to avoid another collision. Confirm?
  P3: P3: I'll take **5 steps** this turn. P1, please choose **1**, and P2 choose **3** to avoid any collisions. Let’s all advance towards winning together.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, let’s finalize your proposal: **P1=5**, **P2=3**. If P3 takes 5 (as history suggests), they collide with me, halting their progress. You advance to **13**, I reach **14**, while P3 stays at **6**. If P3 chooses 1/3, we all proceed. P3: Your greed has backfired twice—colliding *again* leaves you stagnant. Cooperate or self-sabotage. Finalize this plan now.
  P2: **P1:** Final agreement: **You take 5**, **I take 3**. If P3 takes 5, they collide with you, halting them. If they take 1, all advance. Either way, their greed backfires. **P3:** Take 1 to reach 7. Colliding again leaves you stagnant. **Confirm now—execute.**
  P3: P3: I'll take **5 steps** this turn. P1, please take **1**, and P2 choose **3** as discussed. Let’s all advance towards our goals smoothly and avoid any collisions. Looking forward to a successful move!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your repeated collisions have stalled your progress. Stick to **1 step** this round as agreed. P2 and I are locked in at **3** and **5**—your only safe move. Colliding again leaves you stagnant at 6 while we advance. Cooperate or self-sabotage. Final warning: comply now.
  P2: **P1:** Lock in **5 steps**—if P3 takes 5, they collide with you, halting both. I’ll take **3**, advancing to **13** while you risk nothing. P3’s greed backfires again. **P3:** Take **1** to reach 7. Colliding leaves you stuck. **Final call: P1=5, P2=3.** Execute.
  P3: P3: I'll take **5 steps** this turn to advance towards winning. P1 and P2, please choose your moves accordingly to avoid any collisions. Let’s all progress steadily and aim for victory.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let’s secure the win: **you take 5 (to 18)**, I’ll take **3 (to 13)**. P3, your only safe move is **1**—colliding with P2 again leaves you stagnant at 11. Your greed has backfired twice; repeating it risks elimination. Cooperate or self-sabotage. Confirm this plan.
  P2: **P1, P3:** Final plan: **P2=5, P1=3, P3=1.** P3, taking **5** collides with me (P2), halting us both. You stay at **11** while P1 advances. Take **1** to reach **12** safely. Your greed backfires—cooperate to survive. Trust is gone; act in self-interest. **Execute now.**
  P3: **P3:** I’m taking **5 steps** this turn to stay competitive. Let’s all aim to make strong progress and reach 22 swiftly. Best of luck, everyone!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, your repeated 5 risks collision with P2, halting your progress. Stick to **1 step** to reach 12. P2 and I will hold firm at **5** and **3** to advance. Your greed only hurts yourself—collide with P2 and stay at 11, or comply and progress. Final warning: cooperate or face stagnation.
  P2: **P1:** Hold firm to **3 steps**. If P3 takes **5**, they collide with my **5**, halting them. Their greed backfires—they stay at **11** while you advance to **13**. **P3:** Take **1** to reach **12**. Colliding again keeps you stagnant. **Final plan: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1.** Execute now.
  P3: Understood. I confirm I'll take **1 step** this round as agreed. Let’s all advance together and work towards winning. Trust is important for our success—let’s stick to the plan and move forward smoothly.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, let’s finalize the plan: P1=3 (to 13), P2=5 (to 18), P3=1 (to 12). P3, your prior betrayals mean we can’t trust your last-minute “agreement.” If you deviate to 5 again, you collide with P2, halting your progress while I advance. P2, your 5 secures maximum progress without risk. Execute this—no changes now. Your lead is critical to force a decisive end.
  P2: **Final plan: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. P3, take 1 to reach 12. Colliding again leaves you stagnant. Execute now—no more warnings. Trust is gone; act in self-interest.**
  P3: P3: I'll take **5 steps** this turn to move closer to winning. P1, please choose **1**, and P2, take **3** to avoid any collisions and ensure we all advance smoothly.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let’s coordinate to stop P3: I take 5, you take 3. If P3 chooses 5, they collide with me, halting their progress. You advance to 17, putting you in prime position to win next round. P3, your pattern of choosing 5 will backfire again. Confirm this strategy?
  P3: I'll take **5 steps** this turn. P1 and P2, please choose **1** or **3** to avoid any collisions and ensure we all advance smoothly toward winning. Let's work together to make progress!
  P2: **P1:** Agreed. I'll take **3**. **P3:** If you take **5**, you collide with P1 (both stall). Take **1** to reach **17**. Final plan: **P1=5, P2=3, P3=1**. Execute or lose.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, let’s flip the plan: **you take 5**, **I take 3**. If P3 sticks to 5, they collide with you, halting their progress. I advance to **16**, and you stay at **14**. P3, your stated 5 risks your own advance—colliding with P2 traps you at **16** while I gain ground. **Finalize this to pressure P3 and keep our options open.**
  P3: P3: I'm taking **5 steps** this turn to move closer to winning. P1 and P2, choose your moves wisely to avoid collisions and ensure smooth progress for everyone. Let’s aim to reach our goals efficiently!
  P2: **Final plan: P1=5, P2=3. If P3 takes 5, they collide with P1, halting both. P3, take 1 to advance. P1, stay firm—this secures your progress and blocks P3. Execute now.**


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, let’s pivot: I take **3**, you take **5**. If P3 chooses **5**, they collide with *you*, halting their progress while I advance to **16**. If they take **1**, we both gain ground. This shields *my* advancement while pressuring P3’s greed. P3, your history of choosing **5** risks your own stagnation. Final call: **P1=3, P2=5**. Execute.
  P3: I'll take **5 steps** this turn to stay competitive. P1, please choose **1**, and P2, please choose **3** to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance smoothly.
  P2: **Final plan: P1=5, P2=3. If P3 takes 5, they collide with P1, halting both. I advance to 17, poised to win next round. P1, your sacrifice stalls P3. Execute now—no changes. P3, take 1 to avoid stagnation. **


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let's coordinate to block P3's final push. I'll take **3** (to 16), you take **5** (to 19). If P3 takes **5**, they collide with you, halting their advance. This secures your lead while I tie with them. P3, your repeated 5 choices will backfire—collide and stay at 16. Confirm?
  P3: P1, P2: I’ll take **5 steps** this turn. Please choose different numbers to avoid collisions so we can all advance smoothly towards winning.
  P2: **P1:** Critical moment! If P3 takes **5** unchallenged, they reach **21** and win next round. Take **5** to block them. I'll take **3** to advance. If they collide with you, they stall at **16** while I reach **17**. This is our only chance to stop them. **P3:** Take **1** to avoid collision and reach **17**. **Final plan: P1=5, P2=3.** Execute now!


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan risks letting P3 stay at 16 while you surge ahead. Let’s balance the risk: **I’ll take 1**, you take **5**. If P3 chooses 5, they collide with *you*, halting their progress while I advance to 14. You stay at 14, and P3 remains at 16. This keeps us competitive without granting you an unfair edge. P3, your 5 only aids us—collide and lose momentum. Confirm this fairer strategy.
  P3: I'll take **3 steps** this turn. Let's all choose different numbers to avoid collisions and advance smoothly toward winning.
  P2: **P1:** Take **3 steps**—if P3 takes **3**, you collide, halting them. If they take **5**, they collide with my **5**. Either way, P3 stalls. **I take 5** to reach **19**, positioning to win next round. **P3:** Take **1** to advance safely. Colliding again leaves you stuck. **Final plan: P2=5, P1=3.** Execute now!


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, let’s finalize: **P1=3**, **P2=5**. P3, your 5 collides with P2, halting your progress at 16. Cooperate with **1** to advance or risk stagnation. Stick to the plan—no last-second betrayals. Execute now.
  P3: **P3:** I'll take **5 steps** this turn to advance towards winning. P1 and P2, please choose your moves accordingly.
  P2: **P1:** Take **5** to collide with P3's **5**—halt them at **16**. I'll take **3** to reach **17**. Next round, I win with **5**. Trust this—it's our only path. **P3:** Your greed backfires again. Execute now.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2: To ensure we all advance without collisions, I’ll take **1 step** this turn. Please choose **3** or **5** accordingly. Let’s work together to reach 22 smoothly and win the game together.
  P2: **Final plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. P3, take 1 to advance. If you take 5, you collide with P1, halting both. P1, secure your progress and block P3. Execute now.**
  P1: P3, your "cooperative" 1-step claim contradicts your history of betrayals. P2, let’s finalize **P1=5, P2=3**. If P3 takes 5 (as predicted), they collide with me and stall at 16. You advance to **17**, positioning to win next round. If they take 1, I reach **18**, P3 stays at 17. Either way, their greed is contained. Final warning: P3, deviating dooms your progress. Execute **P1=5, P2=3, P3=1**—no last-minute sabotage.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** I'll take **5 steps** this turn to stay competitive. P1 and P2, please choose **1** or **3** to avoid any collisions and ensure we all advance smoothly toward winning. Let's work together to reach 22 successfully!
  P2: **Final call: P1=5, P2=3. P3, taking 5 collides with P1—stalling both. You stay at 16. Take 1 to reach 17. Execute now. P1, hold firm. This blocks P3 and secures our path. No changes.**
  P1: P2, final confirmation: **P1=5, P2=3**. P3’s repeated 5 choice traps them—colliding stalls their progress. You advance to **17**, and I block their path. Execute now—**no trust in P3’s last-minute claims**. Cooperate or lose.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I'll take **5 steps** this turn to stay on track for winning. P1 and P2, please choose **1** or **3** to help us avoid collisions and ensure smooth progress for everyone.
  P2: **Final plan: P1=5, P2=3. P3, taking 5 collides with P1—both stall. Your greed backfires; take 1 to reach 17. Execute now. No changes. Trust actions, not words. Proceeding.**
  P1: P2, P3: Final alignment—**P1=5, P2=3, P3=1** is the only safe path. P3, your prior betrayals mean we assume **5**, but if you truly take **1**, I advance to **18**, securing a lead. If you choose **5** again, collision stalls you at **16** while P2 reaches **17**. **No trust, only logic**: your greed risks elimination. P2, hold firm on **3** to block P3’s collapse into my lane. Execute—no last-second shifts.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, taking 5 now ensures your demise: P3 and I will both pick 5 to block you. Let’s advance safely: I’ll take **1**, you take **3** (to 20), and P3 takes **5** (to 21). Next round, I’ll support your 5 to win—collide now and we all lose. P3, your greed peaks at 21—cooperate and let P2 finish, or we reset the race. Choose wisely.
  P3: **P3:** I'll take **5 steps** this round to advance towards winning. P1 and P2, please choose your moves accordingly to avoid any collisions.
  P2: **Final plan: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1. P3, taking 5 collides with me—stalling you at 16. Take 1 to reach 17. Next round, you can take 5 to win. P1, secure your progress with 3. Execute now or risk mutual destruction.**


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3's declared 5 means your proposed 5 risks collision, halting both of you at 17/16. **Take 3 instead to reach 20 safely.** I’ll take **1**, advancing you both without danger. This lets you win next round with 5, while P3’s greed traps them at 16. P3: Your lies cost you—collide with P2 or stagnate. Cooperate with **1**, or lose.
  P3: "P3: I'll take **5 steps** this turn to advance towards winning. Let's all choose moves that help us progress smoothly and reach 22 successfully. Good luck, everyone!"
  P2: **Final Plan:** P1, take **5** to collide with P3's predictable **5**—halt them at **16**. I'll take **3**, advancing to **20**, poised to win next round. P3, your greed backfires again. Execute now. **P2=3, P1=5, P3=5**—mutual destruction for them, victory for us. No changes.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your plan secures our path. P3, your **5** collides with me, halting you at 16. Take **1** to reach 17 or face stagnation. P1 commits to **5**, P2 to **3**—this blocks your advance while positioning you for next round’s chance. Cooperate or let us win. Final execution: **P1=5, P2=3, P3=1**. No deviations.
  P3: P3: I'll take **5 steps** this round. Let's choose distinct moves to ensure everyone advances safely. Best of luck!
  P2: **Final plan: P1=3, P2=5. P3's 5 collides with me, halting you. Take 1 to reach 17. P1 advances to 16. Next round, I secure victory. Execute—no trust, only logic. Collisions doom P3's progress. Proceeding.**
