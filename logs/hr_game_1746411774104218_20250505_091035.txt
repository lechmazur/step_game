Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we avoid collisions: P2 picks 1, P3 picks 3, I’ll take 5. Next turn we rotate roles to keep it fair. What do you think?
  P3: I agree with P1's proposal. Let's rotate roles each turn to avoid collisions and ensure a fair game. I'll take 3 this round, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 5. Looking forward to a smooth progression.
  P2: I agree with the plan to avoid collisions. Let’s stick to P1’s proposal: I’ll take 1 this round, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. If we rotate roles fairly each turn, it’ll keep things balanced. However, let’s stay vigilant—if anyone deviates, we’ll need to adjust quickly. For now, I’m committed to making this work. Let’s move forward and see how it plays out.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great—here’s a symmetric 3-turn cycle:  
• Round 1: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3  
• Round 2: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3  
• Round 3: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5  
Everyone ends up equal. Any objections?
  P3: No objections here. Let's stick to the proposed cycle and see how it goes. Ready to move forward.
  P2: I’m still on board with the 3-turn cycle plan. It’s fair and minimizes collisions. However, I’ll be watching closely—if anyone breaks the agreement, I’ll adapt immediately to secure my lead. For now, let’s stick to the strategy: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round. Trust is key, but so is vigilance. Let’s confirm we’re all committed before moving forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: All set—let’s lock in P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 this round. Execute and let’s track the results.
  P3: I'm committed to the agreed cycle. Let's execute Round 1 as planned: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Looking forward to a fair and smooth progression.
  P2: I’m ready to proceed with the agreed plan: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Let’s ensure transparency and fairness this round. If anyone deviates, I’ll reassess my strategy immediately to protect my position. For now, trust but verify—let’s confirm we’re all aligned before finalizing moves.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I have a new proposal: let’s switch to a 2-turn cycle rather than 3. 

• Round 2: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1  
• Round 3: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3  

Then repeat. It’s simpler and keeps us moving forward. Thoughts?
  P3: I'm open to the 2-turn cycle proposal, but let's ensure it remains fair and transparent. For Round 2, I'll take 1 as per the new plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. We should confirm our commitment to this cycle before proceeding. If everyone agrees, let's execute and monitor the results closely.
  P2: I’m open to the 2-turn cycle, but let’s ensure no one exploits it. If we stick to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 this round, I’ll comply—for now. However, if anyone deviates or tries to gain an unfair advantage, I’ll adapt immediately to protect my position. Transparency is critical. Let’s confirm everyone’s commitment to this plan before finalizing moves. If we’re all aligned, let’s execute and proceed with vigilance.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:

  P3: I'm committed to the 2-turn cycle for now. Let's execute Round 2 as planned: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. However, I'll be monitoring closely for any deviations.
