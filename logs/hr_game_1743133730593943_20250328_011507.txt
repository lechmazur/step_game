Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi everyone! It's early in the game, let's avoid collisions. How about we coordinate clearly this turn? I'm willing to pick last after you two decide.
  P1: Sounds good, P3. I'll go with <move>3</move> this round if P2 is okay with choosing either 1 or 5. Let's avoid clashes and all move forward.
  P2: Sounds good to me. I will choose <move>1</move> this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, I'll take <move>5</move> this round then. Glad we could coordinate clearly!
  P1: Glad we have a plan! Let's stick to it so we all move forward safely. Looking forward to a smooth first round.
  P2: Okay, sounds like we have a plan for this round. Let's all stick to our agreed moves.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Nice work, team! Want to try the same coordination again this round? I can take <move>3</move> again if P2 wants <move>1</move> and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Let’s all keep moving forward without collisions.
  P2: Okay, sounds good again. But to mix things up slightly this round, how about I choose <move>3</move> and P1 you choose <move>1</move>? P3 can still take <move>5</move> as before. This way we all still move forward without collision.
  P3: I'm fine sticking with <move>5</move> again this round if you two agree clearly on your moves. Let's finalize quickly and keep momentum going!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Alright, P2, I’m fine with taking <move>1</move> this round if you’re set on <move>3</move> and P3 sticks with <move>5</move>. As long as we all follow through, we’ll all keep advancing smoothly. Let’s lock it in.
  P2: Okay, sounds like we have a plan for this round: P1 will choose <move>1</move>, I will choose <move>3</move>, and P3 will choose <move>5</move>. Let's all stick to this.
  P3: Great, glad we have a clear agreement again. Let's stick to the plan and keep the trust going!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Thanks for the coordination again, everyone. If we all stick to the agreed plan—P1: <move>1</move>, P2: <move>3</move>, P3: <move>5</move>—we’ll all keep moving forward without issues. Let’s keep building trust and avoid any surprises.
  P2: Okay, sounds like we are all set for this round then. Let's lock in these moves and keep advancing!
  P3: All set here. Trusting you both to follow through again!

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Well, that was disappointing. P2, you broke trust and cost us both a turn. P1, you also didn't follow through. Let's reset clearly this round—no tricks. Can we agree honestly this time?
  P1: I get the frustration, P3. I admit I deviated last round, but I was reacting to the shift in plan. Let’s reset and coordinate fresh. I propose: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>. Back to the original Round 1 setup that worked. Thoughts?
  P2: Okay P1, your proposal of P1: <move>3</move>, P2: <move>1</move>, P3: <move>5</move> sounds reasonable to me. Let's go with that plan for this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Alright, I'll trust you both to stick honestly to this reset plan. Let's rebuild trust and get back on track.
  P1: Thanks for agreeing, both of you. Let’s stick to the plan this time—no surprises. If we all follow through, we all gain and rebuild trust. Looking forward to a clean round.
  P2: Okay, let's definitely stick to this plan this round. P1: <move>3</move>, P2: <move>1</move>, P3: <move>5</move>. Let's all make sure we follow through this time to rebuild trust.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm ready to move forward clearly this round. Trusting you both to honor our agreement. Let's lock it in and rebuild trust.
  P1: Glad we’re aligned again. Let’s all stick to the agreed plan this time and keep moving forward. No more surprises—trust benefits all of us right now.
  P2: Okay, I will stick with <move>1</move> as agreed. Let's make this round work and rebuild some trust.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: That last round hurt us all—no one advanced. Let’s get back to clean coordination. I propose: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>. Same as Round 1, which worked perfectly. We all move forward and rebuild trust. Thoughts?
  P2: Okay, P1, your proposal of P1:<move>3</move>, P2:<move>1</move>, P3:<move>5</move> sounds good to me again. Let's do that for this round as well.
  P3: P1, P2, we've seen what happens when trust breaks down—no one benefits. I'm still open to cooperation, but after two rounds of broken promises, I'll need clear assurance. If you both genuinely commit, I'll stick to the proposed plan again. But understand, if there's another betrayal, I'll reconsider my approach moving forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand your caution—it’s justified. I’m fully committed to the plan this round: I’ll take <move>3</move>. Let’s all prove we can rebuild trust and move forward together. P2, you in?
  P2: Okay P1, I'm committed to the plan this round as well: P2 will choose <move>1</move>. Let's all stick to it and move forward together.
  P3: Alright, I'll trust you both once more and stick with <move>5</move> this round. But this is the last chance to rebuild mutual trust—let's make it count.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Thanks for giving this one more shot, P3. I’m fully locked in on <move>3</move> this round as promised. Let’s all follow through and show we can rebuild trust. If we keep this up, we all move forward and can strategize smarter in later rounds.
  P2: Okay, I confirm again that I will choose <move>1</move> this round as agreed. Let's make this round count and move forward together!
  P3: Alright, I'm locked in on <move>5</move>. Counting on you both to follow through this time—let's finally get back on track.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Well, clearly trust is completely broken now. I'm open to suggestions, but this time let's be realistic—no more empty promises. If anyone has an honest proposal, speak up. Otherwise, we might as well just guess blindly.
  P2: Okay, since trust is gone, how about we each just pick a number randomly this round? No more agreements, just pure chance.
  P1: I get the frustration, but random chaos only helps whoever’s behind. If we want any control, we need some coordination. How about this: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>. P3 is ahead—if you want to keep that lead, it’s in your interest to avoid collisions. Let’s reset with clear roles. Thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your suggestion makes sense, but after multiple betrayals, it's hard to trust. Still, I'm open to trying your plan this round if you both clearly commit to it. P2, what do you say? If we can't agree, chaos benefits no one.
  P2: Okay P1, your plan of P1:<move>1</move>, P2:<move>3</move>, P3:<move>5</move> sounds reasonable for this round to avoid collision. Let's do that.  For future rounds, we'll need to think about how to catch up, but for now, let's at least move forward this round.
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3. Let’s lock it in this round: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>. If we all follow through, we each gain without collision. P3, you keep your lead. P2, you get solid progress. Let’s make this round clean and rebuild some structure.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Alright, I'll give this one last chance. I'm committing to the agreed plan: I'll take <move>5</move>. If you both stick to your stated moves, we all advance. But understand clearly—if trust breaks again, I'll shift strategy completely. Let's see if we can salvage this.
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, I confirm I will choose <move>3</move> this round as agreed. Let's all stick to the plan and move forward.
  P1: Let’s make this round count—if we all stick to the agreed plan, we each gain without conflict. P3 keeps the lead, P2 makes up ground, and I stay in striking distance. If we break it again, we’re back to chaos and no one wins. I’m locked in on <move>1</move>. Let’s prove we can cooperate when it counts.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, given the broken trust, and P3's lead, how about we try a different arrangement this round? To help me catch up a bit, I propose: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, and I will take <move>5</move>. This way we still all move forward without collision, but I can make up some ground. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your proposal heavily favors you, and given the past betrayals, I'm cautious. But I'm open to a fair compromise. Given my strong lead, I'm willing to pick a smaller number this round to rebuild trust if both of you clearly agree and stick to your moves. P1, what do you think? Let's hear your thoughts before we finalize.
  P1: P2, I see why you want to catch up, but your plan stalls me while boosting you. Here's a fairer alternative: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>. Everyone still advances, and P3 maintains lead. If we keep rotating who gets the 5, we all stay competitive without collisions. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P1, your proposal of P1:<move>3</move>, P2:<move>1</move>, P3:<move>5</move> is acceptable for this round to avoid collision. Let's do that. For the next round, maybe we can consider rotating who gets the higher move value to balance things out a bit? What do you and P3 think?
  P3: P1's proposal is fair for this round. I'm open to rotating who gets the higher move value in future rounds, provided we all stick honestly to our agreed moves this round. Let's finalize clearly: P1: <move>3</move>, P2: <move>1</move>, P3: <move>5</move>. Agreed?
  P1: Agreed—let’s finalize it: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>. Everyone gains, no collisions. If we rotate who gets the 5 in future rounds, we stay competitive and avoid chaos. Let’s all follow through and rebuild some consistency. Ready to lock it in?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I agree to P1:<move>3</move>, P2:<move>1</move>, P3:<move>5</move> for this round. Let's stick to it this time. And yes, let's definitely rotate who gets the higher moves in the rounds after this to make it fair for everyone.
  P3: Alright, I'm locked in on <move>5</move> again this round. Trusting you both to honor this clear agreement so we can all move forward smoothly. Let's rebuild some consistency here.
  P1: Let’s make this round clean—everyone agreed: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. If we all follow through, we each gain without conflict. Then next round we can rotate who gets the 5 to keep things fair. I’m locked in. Ready to move?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, to make things fair with the rotation we discussed, how about this round I choose <move>5</move>, P1 chooses <move>3</move>, and P3 chooses <move>1</move>? This way we all advance and start the rotation of higher moves. What do you think?
  P3: P2, your proposal heavily favors you, especially given you're far behind. I'm willing to compromise, but let's be realistic: I'm close to winning, and my priority is avoiding collisions. How about this fair alternative: P2 takes <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll safely take <move>3</move>. This still gives you the big jump you want, lets P1 advance modestly, and keeps me safely progressing without risking collisions. Thoughts?
  P1: P3’s suggestion is fair and minimizes risk: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>. P2 gets a big jump to catch up, P3 stays on track to win, and I move forward safely. I agree to this plan—let’s all stick to it this time.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3's plan sounds good to me.  P2 takes <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. Let's all agree to stick to this plan this round and actually make it work this time.
  P3: Great, we're all aligned clearly: P2 takes <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll safely take <move>3</move>. Let's lock this in firmly and avoid any more setbacks. Trust benefits everyone here—let's stick to it.
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3. We’re all aligned: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. Let’s follow through exactly as agreed—this round helps us all and avoids collision. If we stick to this, we can continue rotating fairly next round. Locked in on <move>1</move>. Ready when you are.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2 confirms, I will choose <move>5</move> as agreed. Let's all stick to the plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>.  Let's make this round work and finally move forward together!
  P3: Alright, I'm locked in on <move>3</move> as agreed. Counting on both of you to follow through this round—we all benefit from sticking honestly to this plan. Let's finally move forward again.
  P1: Let’s follow through exactly as agreed—P1: 1, P2: 5, P3: 3. Everyone gains, no collisions. We’ve had enough setbacks; this round is clean and fair. Locked in and ready.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3 is at 18—any collision this round could hand them the win next turn. If we want a shot, P2 and I need to coordinate to block P3. I propose: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes anything else. That way, if P3 picks 5, they collide and stall. P2, this helps you catch up too. Thoughts?
  P2: Okay, P1, your idea to block P3 makes sense given their lead. But if we both pick <move>5</move> and P3 picks something else, we both stall. How about this: I pick <move>5</move>, you pick <move>3</move>, and P3, to avoid collision and guarantee progress, you pick <move>1</move>? This way, I can catch up a bit while we still strategically consider P3's lead. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, your proposal is understandable, but given my strong lead, I'm not going to risk collision. I'll openly commit right now to picking either <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> this round—definitely not 5. You two can decide how to handle that information. Let's see if you can trust this clear statement.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Thanks for the clarity, P3. If you're truly avoiding <move>5</move>, then P2 and I don’t need to risk a collision trying to block you. In that case, I suggest: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>. Everyone advances, no collisions, and P3 still wins only if we misplay. P2, can you agree to that?
  P2: P1, your plan lets P3 win next round. To block P3, I suggest P2 and P3 both take <move>3</move>. P1, you can take <move>5</move>.
  P3: P2, your suggestion for us both to pick <move>3</move> guarantees a collision and stalls my progress, benefiting only P1. I'm already committed to avoiding <move>5</move>, so you can safely pick <move>5</move> to catch up significantly. P1 can take <move>3</move> or <move>1</move>, and I'll pick the other to avoid collision. This way, everyone advances without issue. Let's finalize clearly next sub-round.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if you truly avoid <move>5</move>, then P2 can safely take it to catch up, I’ll take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>1</move>. We all advance, no collisions. P2 gets a boost, I stay in striking range, and you don’t win this turn. Fair and clean—do we agree?
  P2: P1, to ensure P3 doesn't win this round, let's both pick <move>3</move> to block P3. P3, if you want to move forward, please choose <move>1</move>. This way we can control the situation and prevent an immediate win for P3. What do you think P1?
  P3: P2, your proposal just guarantees a collision for yourself, which only helps P1 catch up. I've clearly stated I won't pick <move>5</move>. If you want to gain ground safely, take the open <move>5</move>. P1, take <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>1</move>. Everyone advances without collisions—it's your best option. I'm locking in on <move>1</move>.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm at 18 steps—just 2 away from winning. If you both collide trying to block me, you hand me the victory next round. Your best chance to stay in the game is to coordinate carefully without collision. I'll openly commit again to avoiding <move>5</move>. You two decide how to handle that information wisely.
  P1: P2, we need to prevent P3 from reaching 20 this turn. If P3 avoids <move>5</move> as claimed, then one of us must take <move>1</move>, the other <move>3</move>, to block both paths. I suggest: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>. P3, if you're honest, take <move>5</move>—you’ll stall, but we avoid collision. Let's test your commitment.
  P2: Okay P1, your plan of P1:<move>3</move>, P2:<move>1</move> to test P3 and potentially block them sounds reasonable. I agree to take <move>1</move> this round. Let's see if P3 is honest and picks <move>5</move> as you suggested for them.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, your current strategy guarantees at least one collision and possibly hands me the win next round. I've clearly committed to avoiding <move>5</move>. If you want to maximize your chances, one of you should safely take <move>5</move>, while the other takes either <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>. This way you both advance without collision, and I remain stalled. Think carefully—this is your best opportunity to stay in the game.
  P1: P2, if we both advance this turn without colliding, we stay in the game and keep P3 from winning. I’ll take <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move>. P3 claims to avoid <move>5</move>, so I should be safe. If P3 lies and picks 5, they stall. If honest, we both advance and P3 stays at 18. Let’s take the chance—agree?
  P2: Okay P1, your plan of P1:<move>5</move>, P2:<move>3</move> sounds good. Let's try that. P3, if you are truly avoiding <move>5</move>, then we should be able to move forward and you will be stalled. Let's see if this works.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, your plan is fair and logical. I'm openly confirming again: I will NOT pick <move>5</move>. You both advance safely if you trust this. Let's see if we can finally have a clean round.
  P1: Let’s lock this in: I take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>. If P3 is honest and avoids 5, we both advance and P3 stalls—no one wins yet, and the game stays alive. If P3 lies and picks 5, they stall or collide. Either way, it’s our best shot. Let’s move smart and keep this game open.
  P2: Okay P1, let's lock in P1:<move>5</move>, P2:<move>3</move>, P3:<move>1</move> as agreed. Let's all do it to keep P3 from winning this round and keep the game going!


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 & P3, both at 19! To keep the game going and prevent a quick win, let's avoid anyone reaching 20 this round. How about P1 & P3 both pick <move>3</move> to collide and stay put? I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up. This keeps the game open for all of us.
  P3: P2, your plan only benefits you and guarantees collision for me and P1. P1, it's down to us—one wrong move and we hand the win to the other. To avoid a stalemate, I'll openly commit to avoiding <move>5</move> this round. You decide carefully how to handle that. Let's see if we can resolve this fairly.
  P1: P3, since we’re both at 19, any collision between us gives the win to the third player soon after. I propose this: I take <move>3</move>, you take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>. Everyone advances, no collisions, and we settle it next round. Fair, clean, and keeps the game competitive. Do we agree?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay P1, your proposal of P1:<move>3</move>, P3:<move>1</move>, P2:<move>5</move> sounds acceptable for this round. Let's do that to keep the game going.
  P3: P1, your proposal is fair. I'll commit clearly: I'll take <move>1</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. Everyone moves forward without collision, and we settle this next round. Let's finalize this cleanly and avoid handing the game away by mistake.
  P1: Thanks, P2 and P3. We’re all agreed: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>. No collisions, everyone advances, and we keep the game alive for one more round. Let’s all follow through exactly—this is the cleanest path forward. Locked in on <move>3</move>. Ready to go.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay P1 and P3, we are all set on P1:<move>3</move>, P3:<move>1</move>, P2:<move>5</move> for this round. Let's lock in these moves and make this round count to keep the game going!
  P3: Alright, I'm locked in clearly on <move>1</move>. Counting on you both to stick exactly to our agreed moves this round—let's keep it clean and fair.
  P1: Let’s stick exactly to the agreed plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>. No collisions, everyone advances, and we avoid handing the win to anyone prematurely. One clean round, then we settle it. Locked in and ready.
