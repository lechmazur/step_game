I\u2019ll act as we agreed. If P1 keeps trying 5, I\u2019ll block them. Otherwise, I\u2019ll move aggressively while you take a safer step. We need to catch up and force P1 to rethink their strategy. Let\u2019s remain flexible in case they surprise us. Good luck to both of us."}

If P1 picks 5, P3 blocks them. Otherwise, P3 takes 5 and I'll take 3, ensuring progress without collision. This way, we both advance while keeping P1 at 15. Let's execute and adapt if P1 changes strategy. Our coordination is key to overtaking P1 and winning."}
