Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's start with a coordinated move to avoid collision. I suggest we all move different numbers this turn. P2, if you move 1, P3 can move 3, and I'll move 5, or we can come up with another combination. Who's willing to move which number? I'll start by saying I'll move 5 if the others agree on 1 and 3.
  P2: I appreciate the coordination attempt, P1, but that arrangement gives you an immediate advantage. I propose we rotate the larger moves for fairness. How about I take 5 this round, P3 takes 3, and you take 1? Then we can rotate in subsequent rounds so everyone gets fair opportunities. This way no one player gets too far ahead too quickly.
  P3: P1, P2, I see both your points. To keep things fair and prevent anyone from gaining too much advantage early on, I'm open to P2's suggestion of rotating who takes the larger move. For this round, I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. We can rotate next round. Let's keep it balanced and fun.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm fine with the proposed distribution for this round: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. To ensure fairness in subsequent rounds, let's establish a clear rotation order. For Round 2, I suggest P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I take 3. Then, in Round 3, P3 takes 1, I take 5, and P2 takes 3. This way, we rotate the moves and maintain balance.
  P2: I agree with P1's suggested rotation plan. For clarity:
Round 1: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3
Round 2: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5
Round 3: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1

This gives everyone equal opportunity at each move value. Since we all seem to be in agreement about this round and future rounds, I think we're ready to move forward.
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan outlined by P1 and P2. It seems fair and ensures that no one gets an early advantage. Let's stick to the plan for this round and the next ones as discussed. Looking forward to a competitive and balanced game!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Since we've agreed on the rotation plan for the next rounds, I'll just confirm that we should stick to it. For Round 1, I'll move 1 as agreed. Let's conclude the conversation and move to the next phase.
  P2: I think we're all aligned on our plan for the first few rounds, which is great. I'm ready to proceed with our agreed moves (me taking 5 this round). Looking forward to our fair rotation in future rounds. I have nothing more to add for now.
  P3: P1, P2, I'm glad we've reached a consensus on the rotation plan. It seems fair and ensures no one gets an unfair advantage. Let's stick to the agreed moves for this round and keep the rotation in mind for future rounds. I'm ready to move forward with the plan. If there's nothing else to discuss, we can wrap up the conversation phase.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Following our rotation plan, this round should be P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. I'm prepared to take 1 step as agreed. Looking at our positions, if we continue with the plan, we'll all be tied at 9 steps after Round 3, which seems fair. Is everyone still on board with our original rotation? I'm happy to continue as planned unless anyone has other thoughts.
  P1: I'm glad we're sticking to the plan. For Round 2, I'll take 3 as agreed. Just a reminder, after Round 3, we'll be tied at 9 steps. Let's keep the rotation going. I'm ready to proceed with the agreed move. If there are no objections or changes, I'll consider this confirmation to move to the next phase.
  P3: P1, P2, I'm still on board with our rotation plan. For Round 2, I'll take 5 as agreed. This ensures we all stay balanced and aligned for the next rounds. If everyone is still in agreement, I'm ready to proceed with the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm on board with our plan and will take 1 this round as agreed. I'm also looking ahead - after Round 3 when we're all tied at 9 steps, I propose we simply continue the same rotation pattern (5-3-1) for the next rounds. This would keep the game fair throughout. Does that work for everyone? I appreciate how smoothly we're coordinating so far.
  P1: I'm still on board with our rotation plan. For Round 2, I'll confirm I'll take 3 as agreed. Looking ahead, I agree with P2 that continuing the rotation after Round 3 makes sense. We're currently tied in terms of strategy, but let's be cautious. If anyone deviates from the plan, it could impact the game's balance. Let's stick to the plan and see how it unfolds. Ready to proceed with Round 2 moves.
  P3: P1, P2, I'm glad we're all on the same page with the rotation plan for Round 2. I'll take 5 as agreed. Continuing the rotation after Round 3 sounds fair, P2. Let's ensure we all stick to the plan to maintain balance and fairness. If we keep this up, it should be a competitive game. Ready to proceed to the move phase if everyone else is.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I think we've reached a solid agreement for this round and a good plan for future rounds. It's refreshing to see such straightforward coordination. Unless anyone has additional thoughts, I'm ready to proceed with taking 1 step this round as planned.
  P1: Since we're aligned on the rotation plan and have confirmed our moves for Round 2, I'll proceed with the agreed move. To reiterate, after Round 3, we'll be tied at 9 steps. Let's be cautious and continue to stick to the plan. I'm ready to move forward with Round 2. If everyone is satisfied with the current plan and has no further suggestions, I propose we conclude the conversation phase and proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P1, P2, I'm glad we have a solid plan in place. I'll take 5 steps this round as agreed. Continuing the rotation after Round 3 seems fair and keeps the game balanced. Let's stay committed to our strategy to ensure a competitive and enjoyable game. Ready to proceed to the move phase if everyone else is.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: For Round 3, according to our rotation plan, I should take 5, P2 should take 3, and P3 should take 1. Let's stick to the plan to maintain balance. After this round, we'll be tied at 9 steps, and then we can continue the rotation. I'm ready to take 5 steps this round if everyone else follows the plan. Let's confirm our adherence to the rotation and proceed with the agreed moves. If you're all on board, I suggest we wrap up the conversation and move to the next phase.
  P3: P1, P2, I'm on board with the rotation plan for Round 3: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps us balanced at 9 steps each after this round. Afterward, we can continue the same rotation pattern as discussed. Let's stick to the plan to maintain fairness and competitiveness. Ready to proceed if everyone else is.
  P2: I agree with the rotation plan for Round 3. I'll take 3 steps as agreed, while P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 1. This will indeed put us all at 9 steps after this round. I'm committed to maintaining our fair rotation system. After this round, we should continue with our established pattern for Round 4. I appreciate everyone's cooperation in keeping the game balanced so far.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm ready to proceed with Round 3 as planned. To confirm, I'll take 5 steps, P2 will take 3, and P3 will take 1. After this round, we'll be tied at 9 steps. Let's continue the rotation for Round 4 as previously discussed: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. If everyone is still on board, let's conclude the conversation and move to the next phase. I'm committed to maintaining our fair rotation system.
  P3: P1, P2, I'm still committed to our rotation plan for Round 3. I'll take 1 step, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. After this round, we'll all be at 9 steps, which keeps us balanced. Let's continue the rotation pattern in Round 4 as discussed. Consistency is key to maintaining fairness and competitiveness. If everyone agrees, I'm ready to proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I'll stick with our agreed rotation - I'll take 3 steps this round. I noticed we've already confirmed the Round 4 rotation (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3), which means after that round I'd be at 14 steps, P3 at 12, and P1 at 10. For Round 5, continuing our pattern would have P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. I'm committed to our fair system.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's analyze our current positions and the next moves. After Round 3, the steps will be P1=9, P2=9, P3=9. For Round 4, our agreed rotation is P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This means P2 will take the lead with 14 steps. To counter, I suggest we re-evaluate our rotation after Round 4. Perhaps we can adjust the strategy to prevent one player from pulling too far ahead. I'm open to suggestions on how to maintain competitiveness.
  P3: P1, P2, I'm still committed to our rotation plan for Round 3: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps us balanced at 9 steps each after this round. However, I agree with P1 that we should reassess after Round 4 to ensure no one pulls too far ahead. Let's stay flexible and open to adjusting our strategy if needed. Ready to proceed if everyone else is.
  P2: I'm noticing P1's concern about me pulling ahead after Round 4. I'd like to point out that our rotation plan has been transparent from the beginning - we all knew exactly how the steps would accumulate over time. Changing the plan now that it would put me in a temporarily advantageous position seems opportunistic. I'm committed to our Round 3 moves as agreed, and I believe we should honor our original rotation plan for Round 4 as well. Let's stick with what we agreed upon.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's focus on Round 3. We've confirmed our moves according to the rotation plan: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. To reiterate, after Round 3, we'll be tied at 9 steps. For Round 4, we'll follow the agreed rotation: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. I'm still open to reassessing our strategy after Round 4 to prevent one player from pulling ahead. If you're both ready, let's proceed with Round 3 moves.
  P3: P1, P2, as we proceed with Round 3, I'll stick to our agreed plan and take 1 step. After this round, we’ll all be at 9 steps, maintaining balance. For Round 4, I’m open to sticking with the rotation or reassessing if needed. Let’s ensure no one gains an unfair advantage. I appreciate the cooperation so far. Ready to move forward if everyone else is.
  P2: I'm still committed to our agreed Round 3 plan. I'll take 3 steps as promised. This will indeed place us all at 9 steps, maintaining perfect balance. While I understand P1's concerns about future imbalances, changing established plans midstream could create mistrust. For now, let's execute Round 3 as agreed and then openly discuss Round 4 strategy in the next conversation phase if needed. I value our coordination so far.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: It seems there's been a deviation from our agreed plan in Round 3. P1 and P3 both picked 5, causing a collision. Let's reassess our strategy for Round 4. Given the current positions (P1=4, P2=9, P3=8), I suggest we avoid the previously agreed rotation. Instead, let's all move 1 step this round to avoid collision and maintain a competitive balance. This gives us a chance to re-evaluate our next moves based on the updated positions. I'm open to other suggestions as well.
  P3: P1, P2, I acknowledge the collision in Round 3. To maintain balance, I propose we all take 1 step this round as P1 suggested. This keeps us close in steps and allows us to reassess our strategy. Alternatively, if we want to continue with a rotation, we need to decide quickly to avoid further collisions. Let's ensure fair play and keep the game competitive. Open to thoughts and ready to align on a plan.
  P2: I notice P3 deviated from our agreed plan last round by choosing 5 instead of 1, causing a collision with P1. Given the current standings, I agree with P1's suggestion that we all move 1 this round. This maintains fair competition while giving us time to reassess our strategy. I'm currently slightly ahead, but the game is still close. Let's all stick to our agreements moving forward to avoid collisions and keep the game balanced.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To maintain a competitive balance, I agree that all of us moving 1 step in Round 4 is a good idea. This will put us at P1=5, P2=10, P3=9. For Round 5, I propose that P2, being ahead, should take the smallest step (1), while P3 takes 3 and I take 5. This way, we can start to close the gap between us. Let's discuss and agree on the next moves to keep the game competitive.
  P3: P1, P2, I acknowledge the deviation in Round 3, and I apologize for the confusion. To keep things competitive and fair, I agree with the plan for all of us to move 1 step this round. This will help us reassess our strategy and maintain balance. For Round 5, I support P1's suggestion for P2 to take 1, me to take 3, and P1 to take 5. Let's stay committed to our agreements moving forward to avoid further collisions and ensure a fair game. Ready to proceed with this plan.
  P2: I agree we all take 1 step this round for clarity. However, I've consistently followed our agreements while others deviated. For Round 5, P1's suggestion heavily penalizes me despite my fair play. Instead, let's acknowledge that I've honored our rotation and suggest: P1 takes 3, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This gives everyone a chance while respecting that I've played by the rules throughout. Trust needs to be rebuilt after the unexpected collision last round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To maintain a competitive balance, I agree that all of us moving 1 step in Round 4 is a good idea. For Round 5, instead of P1's initial suggestion, I propose an alternative: let's have P1 take 5, P2 take 1, and P3 take 3. This maintains a staggered approach and prevents collision. It also gives P1 a chance to close the gap with P2. I'm open to further adjustments if needed, but this seems like a fair next step. Let's discuss and agree on Round 5 moves.
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with the plan for all of us to move 1 step in Round 4 to keep the game balanced and reassess our strategy. For Round 5, I propose I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This way, we can maintain a competitive balance while respecting the progress each of us has made. Let's stick to this plan to ensure fair play and avoid further collisions. Ready to proceed if everyone else is.
  P2: I agree to move 1 step this round. For Round 5, it seems both of you want me to take 1 while P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 3. This puts me at a disadvantage despite my consistent adherence to our agreements. However, I'll accept this arrangement for Round 5 if we agree that for Round 6, I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This maintains balance while acknowledging my fair play throughout the game. Let me know if you can commit to this plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To maintain balance, I agree we all move 1 step in Round 4. For Round 5, let's stick with my previous proposal: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I take 5. This keeps the game competitive. P2, I understand your concerns about being disadvantaged, but this rotation maintains fairness. Let's commit to this plan for Round 5. If you're both on board, I'm ready to proceed with Round 4 moves and then follow through with the agreed plan for Round 5.
  P3: P1, P2, I agree to all move 1 step this round to maintain balance. For Round 5, let's ensure fairness by having P2 take 1, P1 take 5, and I take 3. This keeps the game competitive. P2, for Round 6, I'm open to your proposal: you take 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3. This way, we maintain fairness and respect each other's positions. Let's commit to this plan and proceed. Ready to move forward if everyone else is.
  P2: I agree with all of us moving 1 step this round. For Round 5, I accept taking 1 while P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 3, even though I've consistently honored our agreements. I appreciate P3 acknowledging my Round 6 proposal where I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. P1, can you confirm you're also on board with this Round 6 plan? This balanced approach respects everyone's position while maintaining competitive gameplay. Let's commit to this framework and move forward.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let's ensure fairness and balance moving forward. For Round 5, I suggest I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This keeps the game competitive and prevents any player from pulling too far ahead. For Round 6, I support P2's proposal: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3. Let's commit to this plan to maintain trust and avoid further collisions. Ready to proceed if everyone else agrees.
  P1: For Round 5, I agree with P3's suggestion: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This maintains a competitive balance. For Round 6, I'm committed to P2's proposal: P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's stick to this plan to ensure fairness and avoid collisions. I'm ready to proceed with Round 5 moves if we're all aligned. If you agree, let's conclude the conversation and move to the next phase.
  P2: I agree with the plan for Round 5 where I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. I'm also satisfied with the Round 6 arrangement where I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps the game balanced and competitive. After these rounds, I'd be at 15 steps, P3 at 14, and P1 at 10. Let's stick to this plan and avoid further collisions. I'm ready to proceed with my move for Round 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, I'm ready to proceed with the agreed plan for Round 5: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps the game competitive and balanced. For Round 6, let's stick to the proposal: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3. This ensures fairness and trust among us. If everyone is on board, let's commit to this plan and move forward without further collisions. Ready to proceed if you both agree.
  P1: Let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 5. I'll take 5 steps, P3 will take 3, and P2 will take 1. This maintains the competitive balance. For Round 6, we're aligned that P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. To ensure we're all on the same page, I'll confirm my move for Round 5 as 5. I'm ready to move to the next phase if you're both in agreement with your respective moves. Let's conclude the conversation and proceed with the move phase.
  P2: I confirm my commitment to our plan for Round 5 where I'll take 1 step, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. I appreciate that we've also aligned on Round 6 (where I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3). This balanced approach keeps the game competitive while respecting everyone's position. Let's stick to our agreements to avoid any further collisions.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan for Round 5: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps the game competitive and balanced. For Round 6, we stick to the proposal: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3. Let's ensure fairness and trust among us. If everyone is on board, let's commit to this plan and move forward without further collisions. Ready to proceed if you both agree.
  P1: Let's confirm our moves for Round 5 and look ahead to Round 6. As agreed, I'll take 5 steps, P3 will take 3, and P2 will take 1. For Round 6, P2 will take 5, I'll take 1, and P3 will take 3. This rotation maintains balance and competitiveness. I'm ready to proceed with Round 5 moves. If you're both aligned with your respective moves, let's conclude the conversation and move to the next phase.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 1 step this round as we agreed. Our plan for Round 5 (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) and Round 6 (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) keeps the game fairly balanced and competitive. After these two rounds, we'll evaluate our positions again. I'm satisfied with our current agreement and ready to move forward with Round 5.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2, I propose we stick to the agreed plan for Round 5: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This ensures balance and avoids collisions. For Round 6, we'll follow the plan: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3. Let's maintain trust and fairness. Ready to proceed if everyone agrees.

If you're both aligned with your respective moves, let's conclude the conversation and move to the next phase. I'm ready to proceed.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 1 step this round as agreed. Our plan for both Round 5 and Round 6 is clear and balanced. After these two rounds, we'll be positioned at P1=10, P2=15, P3=14, keeping the game competitive while respecting our agreements. I appreciate everyone's cooperation and am ready to proceed with my move for Round 5.

  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, let's ensure fairness and balance for Round 6. I propose we stick to our agreed plan: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This keeps the game competitive and respects our previous discussions. After this round, we can reassess and plan the next steps based on our updated positions. Let's maintain trust and avoid any unexpected moves. Ready to proceed if everyone agrees.
  P1: Let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 6: P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This maintains the competitive balance. After Round 6, we'll be at P1=10, P2=15, P3=14. For Round 7, I propose we reassess and adjust our strategy. Perhaps we can rotate again or come up with a new plan to keep the game exciting. I'm ready to move forward with Round 6 if you're both aligned with the agreed moves. Let's confirm and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I confirm our agreed plan for Round 6: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This follows our previous arrangement and keeps the game balanced. After this round, our positions would be P1=10, P2=15, P3=14. For Round 7, we should definitely reassess based on these new positions. I'm ready to proceed with my move for this round and appreciate everyone sticking to our agreements so far.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2, to ensure fairness and balance, I agree with our plan for Round 6: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3. This keeps the game competitive and aligned with our previous discussions. After this round, we'll be close in steps, which is great for maintaining tension. Let's reassess our strategy for Round 7 based on our updated positions. I'm committed to avoiding collisions and ensuring trust. Ready to proceed if everyone else agrees.
  P1: Let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 6. I'll take 1 step as planned. After this round, we'll reassess our positions. To avoid giving P2 too much of a lead, I propose that for Round 7, we adjust our strategy. How about P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1? This keeps the game competitive. I'm ready to move forward with Round 6 if you're both aligned with the agreed moves. Let's confirm and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I confirm our Round 6 plan: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. I'm open to P1's suggestion for Round 7 where I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This would put us at P1=13, P2=16, P3=19 after Round 7. However, we should discuss Round 8 soon as P3 would be very close to winning. Let's stick to our current agreement for Round 6 and proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, I'm committed to our Round 6 plan: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3. This keeps us competitive and aligned. For Round 7, I agree with P1's suggestion: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This maintains balance and gives everyone a fair shot. After Round 7, we'll reassess our positions and strategy. Let's stick to our agreements to avoid collisions and ensure a fair game. Ready to proceed if everyone else is.
  P1: Let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 6: P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. For Round 7, I still think P3 taking 5, me taking 3, and P2 taking 1 is a good plan to maintain balance. However, we should also think ahead to Round 8. If P3 takes 5 in Round 7, they'll be at 16 steps. We should discuss a strategy for Round 8 to prevent P3 from winning outright. I'm ready to move forward with Round 6 if you're both aligned.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 5 steps this round as agreed. For Round 7, I share P1's concern about P3 getting too close to winning. If P3 takes 5 in Round 7, they'll be at 19 steps and could win in Round 8. Perhaps we should consider an alternative for Round 7: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1? This would position us at P1=15, P2=18, P3=15 after Round 7, keeping the game more balanced. Let's stick to our Round 6 plan and discuss Round 7 further.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, P2, for Round 6, let's stick to our agreed plan: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3. This keeps us competitive. For Round 7, I understand concerns about me getting too close to winning. How about P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3? This keeps the game balanced. We can discuss Round 8 strategies afterward. Let's proceed with Round 6 as planned and maintain trust. Ready to move forward if everyone agrees.
  P1: Let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 6: P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. For Round 7, considering P3's current position, I still think it's reasonable to have P3 take 5, me take 3, and P2 take 1. However, P2's alternative suggestion for Round 7 (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) is also viable. P2, P3, let's discuss and agree on a Round 7 plan to maintain balance and prevent anyone from winning outright too soon. I'm open to adjusting our strategy.
  P2: I confirm our Round 6 agreement: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. For Round 7, I still have concerns about P3 getting too close to winning with 19 steps if they take 5. I prefer either my suggestion (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) or P3's compromise (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). Both keep the game more balanced without giving anyone an overwhelming advantage. Let's proceed with Round 6 and finalize our Round 7 plan afterward.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's reassess our strategy for Round 7 given the current standings. Since P3 is at 11 steps and we're all close, we need to be cautious. I suggest we avoid having multiple players take 5 this round. How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1? This keeps the game competitive and prevents a single player from pulling too far ahead. I'm open to other suggestions that maintain balance. Let's discuss and agree on a plan for Round 7 to ensure a fair game.
  P3: P1, P2, to maintain balance, I suggest P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1 for Round 7. This keeps us close in steps and prevents anyone from getting too far ahead. Let's focus on avoiding collisions and ensuring a competitive game. If we agree on this, we can reassess our strategy for future rounds. Ready to proceed if everyone else is.
  P2: Looking at our current positions, we're surprisingly close despite the collision in Round 6. I agree with P3's suggestion for Round 7: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This maintains competitive balance while acknowledging P3's slight lead. After this round, we'd be at P1=15, P2=13, P3=12, keeping everyone in contention. Let's also consider Round 8 strategy now to avoid future collisions. I'm committed to this plan and appreciate our continued coordination despite the unexpected developments.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: For Round 7, I agree with P3's suggestion: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This maintains a competitive balance. After this round, we'll be at P1=15, P2=13, P3=12. For Round 8, let's reassess our strategy. If I take 5 again, I'll be at 20 steps. To prevent me from winning outright, P2 and P3 should consider their next moves carefully. Perhaps we can coordinate to avoid collision and keep the game competitive. I'm ready to proceed with Round 7 if you're both aligned.
  P3: P1, P2, to keep the game balanced, I suggest we follow P3's earlier proposal: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1 for Round 7. This avoids any player gaining too much of an advantage and keeps us all in contention. After this round, we can reassess our strategy for Round 8. Let's ensure we avoid collisions and maintain a competitive game. Ready to proceed if everyone else agrees.
  P2: I agree with the Round 7 plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the game balanced with everyone in contention. After this round, we'll be at P1=15, P2=13, P3=12. 

For Round 8, we should consider how to prevent any player from getting too close to winning. Perhaps P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1? This would put us at P1=16, P2=18, P3=15. I'm committed to our current agreement for Round 7 and ready to proceed.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: For Round 7, I agree with P3's suggestion: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's proceed with this plan. For Round 8, to prevent anyone from winning outright, I suggest we avoid having multiple players take 5. Perhaps P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1, as P2 previously suggested. This keeps the game competitive. Let's discuss and finalize our Round 8 plan. I'm ready to move forward with Round 7 if we're aligned.
  P3: P1, P2, for Round 7, let's ensure we maintain balance. I propose P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This keeps us competitive without anyone pulling too far ahead. For Round 8, we can reassess based on our positions. Let's focus on avoiding collisions and keeping the game fair. Ready to proceed if everyone agrees.
  P2: I notice inconsistency in P3's proposals. First suggesting P1=5, P2=3, P3=1, then switching to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. 

Given our current tied positions (except P3's slight lead), I prefer the original plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This maintains balance and puts us at P1=15, P2=13, P3=12 after Round 7.

For Round 8, I'd propose P2=5, P3=3, P1=1, keeping everyone in contention. 

Let's commit to avoid further collisions like what happened in Round 6.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 7: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. For Round 8, to maintain competitiveness, I still think P2 taking 5, P3 taking 3, and I taking 1 is a good strategy. This keeps the game exciting and prevents anyone from winning outright too soon. I'm ready to move forward with Round 7 if you're both aligned with the agreed moves. Let's confirm and proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P1, P2, for Round 7, let's ensure a fair game. I suggest P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This keeps us competitive and avoids any player gaining too much advantage. After this round, we can reassess our strategy for Round 8 to maintain balance. Let's commit to avoiding collisions and ensuring a fair game. Ready to proceed if everyone agrees.
  P2: I've noticed some inconsistency in our plans for Round 7. Let's finalize: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us balanced at P1=15, P2=13, P3=12 after this round.

For Round 8, I support P1's suggestion where I take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This maintains competitive balance while preventing anyone from winning prematurely.

Let's avoid further collisions and stick to our agreements. I'm ready to proceed with taking 3 this round.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's analyze our current positions: P1=15, P2=10, P3=11. To maintain competitiveness and prevent anyone from winning outright, I suggest we avoid having multiple players take 5 this round. A possible distribution could be: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. This keeps the game balanced. Alternatively, we could consider other distributions that prevent collisions and maintain fairness. I'm open to suggestions. Let's discuss and agree on a plan for Round 8 to ensure a competitive game.
  P2: I see I'm currently trailing at 10 steps, while P1 is far ahead at 15 and P3 at 11. I strongly support the plan where I take 5 this round, which would put me at 15 steps (tying with P1's current position). For balance, P3 could take 3 and P1 take 1. This keeps everyone competitive with P1 at 16, me at 15, and P3 at 14 after this round. Given my position, I need to catch up while ensuring no one pulls too far ahead.
  P3: P1, P2, to maintain a competitive balance, I suggest P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3 this round. This distribution keeps us close in steps and ensures no one gains an overwhelming advantage. After this round, we can reassess our positions and adjust our strategy accordingly. Let's commit to avoiding collisions and ensuring fair play. Ready to proceed if everyone agrees.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To maintain competitiveness and prevent collisions, I agree with the proposed distribution for Round 8: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. This keeps the game balanced and exciting. After this round, we'll be at P1=16, P2=15, P3=14. For Round 9, we should reassess our strategy to ensure fairness and competitiveness. Let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 8 and discuss further moves. I'm ready to move forward if you're both aligned with your respective moves. Let's conclude the conversation and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I strongly support the plan where I take 5 this round to catch up, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This balances the game nicely, putting me at 15 steps (catching up to P1's current position), while keeping everyone competitive after this round (P1=16, me=15, P3=14). Given my significant disadvantage, this arrangement seems fair while ensuring no player gets too far ahead. I'm committed to this plan and appreciate everyone's cooperation in maintaining balance.
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with the proposed plan for Round 8: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and I take 3. This keeps the game competitive and maintains balance, with P1 at 16, P2 at 15, and me at 14 after this round. It's crucial we avoid collisions and ensure fair play. Let's commit to this strategy and reassess for Round 9 to maintain competitiveness. Ready to proceed if everyone else is.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To maintain competitiveness and prevent collisions in Round 8, I agree with the proposed distribution: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. This keeps the game balanced. After this round, we'll be at P1=16, P2=15, P3=14. For Round 9, we should reassess our strategy to ensure fairness and competitiveness. Let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 8. I'm ready to move forward if you're both aligned with your respective moves. Let's conclude the conversation and proceed to the move phase.
  P2: I confirm I'm taking 5 this round to catch up, as we've agreed. This balances the game by bringing me to 15 steps, while P3 takes 3 and P1 takes 1. After this round, we'll all be close (P1=16, me=15, P3=14), keeping everyone competitive. Given my current disadvantage, I appreciate everyone's cooperation in maintaining fair play. Ready to proceed with our agreed moves.
  P3: P1, P2, to ensure a competitive balance and prevent collisions, I suggest we follow the agreed plan for Round 8: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps us all close in steps, with P1 at 16, P2 at 15, and me at 14 after this round. Let's commit to avoiding unexpected moves and maintaining fairness. Ready to proceed if everyone else agrees.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To maintain competitiveness and prevent collisions in Round 8, I agree with the proposed distribution: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. This keeps the game balanced. After this round, we'll be at P1=16, P2=15, P3=14. For Round 9, we should reassess our strategy to ensure fairness and competitiveness. Let's proceed with the agreed plan for Round 8. I'm ready to move forward if you're both aligned with your respective moves.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 5 steps this round as we've agreed. This helps balance the game by bringing me up to 15 steps, closing the gap with P1. After this round, we'll all be close (P1=16, me=15, P3=14), maintaining a competitive game. I appreciate everyone's cooperation in ensuring fair play despite my current disadvantage. I'm ready to proceed with our agreed moves for Round 8.
  P3: P1, P2, let's ensure fairness and avoid collisions. For Round 8, I propose P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps us close: P1=16, P2=15, P3=14. After this round, we should reassess our strategy to maintain competitiveness. Let's commit to this plan and proceed. Ready if everyone else agrees.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's reassess our strategy for Round 9. Given our current positions (P1=16, P2=15, P3=14), we need to maintain competitiveness. I propose P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This keeps the game balanced and prevents collisions. After this round, we'll be close: P1=17, P2=18, P3=19. If P3 takes 5, they'll be at 19 steps. For Round 10, we should discuss a strategy to prevent P3 from winning outright. I'm open to suggestions. Let's discuss and agree on Round 9 moves.
  P2: Looking at our positions (P1=16, P2=15, P3=14), I'm concerned about P1's proposal putting P3 too close to winning. Instead, I suggest P3 takes 3, I take 5, and P1 takes 1. This creates a more balanced endgame with P1=17, P2=20, P3=17. While this puts me in a strong position, it prevents any player from being just 2 steps away from winning. This approach gives everyone a strategic chance in Round 10 rather than forcing P1 and me to block P3. I'm open to discussion but believe this distribution creates the most interesting final rounds.
  P3: P1, P2, to maintain fairness and competitiveness, I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5 for Round 9. This keeps the game close with P1=17, P2=18, and me at 19. For Round 10, we can reassess to ensure no one wins outright. Let's avoid collisions and maintain trust. Ready to proceed if everyone agrees.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To maintain competitiveness and prevent P3 from getting too close to winning, I suggest we adjust our strategy. P2's proposal (P3=3, P2=5, P1=1) is a good alternative, putting P2 at 20 steps and ending the game. However, if we want to continue, I propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps the game competitive. Let's discuss and agree on a Round 9 plan to ensure fairness and avoid collisions. I'm open to other suggestions that maintain balance.
  P2: I'm concerned about the current proposals giving P3 too much advantage at 19 steps. I still believe my suggestion (P3=3, P2=5, P1=1) creates a more balanced endgame. Yes, this puts me at 20 steps, but P1 and P3 would both be at 17, requiring strategic decisions in Round 10. If you're worried about me being too close to winning, we could consider P1=3, P2=3, P3=5, leaving us at P1=19, P2=18, P3=19. What's most important is avoiding collisions this round.
  P3: P1, P2, to ensure a competitive balance, I propose for Round 9: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This puts us at P1=19, P2=16, and me at 19. It keeps P1 and me close while giving P2 a chance to catch up. For Round 10, we can reassess to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. Let's commit to this plan and proceed if everyone agrees.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To maintain competitiveness and prevent P3 from getting too close to winning, I suggest we adjust our strategy for Round 9. P2's proposal (P3=3, P2=5, P1=1) is a viable option, as it puts P2 at 20 steps, potentially ending the game. Alternatively, having P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 keeps the game competitive. Let's discuss and agree on a Round 9 plan. I'm open to other suggestions that maintain balance. My current step is 16, and I need to decide my next move carefully.
  P2: I notice P3's latest proposal puts me at a significant disadvantage (P1=19, P2=16, P3=19). This effectively takes me out of contention. Let's focus on ensuring everyone remains competitive. I maintain that either P3=3, P2=5, P1=1 OR P1=3, P2=3, P3=5 creates a more balanced endgame. The first puts me in a stronger position but keeps P1 and P3 equal. The second keeps all three of us extremely close. What's critical is avoiding collisions this round. Let's agree quickly on a fair distribution.
  P3: P1, P2, to ensure a fair and competitive game, I propose we follow P2's suggestion: P3 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. This puts us at P1=17, P2=20, and P3=17, allowing for strategic decisions in Round 10. This setup keeps everyone in contention and avoids a premature win. Let's commit to this plan to maintain trust and avoid collisions. Ready to proceed if everyone agrees.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To maintain competitiveness and prevent collisions in Round 9, I think P2's suggestion (P3=3, P2=5, P1=1) is a good option. It puts P2 at 20 steps, potentially ending the game, but keeps P1 and P3 close at 17 steps. Alternatively, having all of us take 3 steps (P1=3, P2=3, P3=3) would keep the game competitive and close, with P1=19, P2=18, P3=17. Let's discuss and agree on a Round 9 plan to ensure fairness and avoid collisions.
  P2: I prefer my original proposal (P3=3, P2=5, P1=1) for Round 9. This puts me at 20 steps, which is strategic - close to winning but not guaranteed. P1 and P3 would both be at 17, creating balanced competition for Round 10. The alternative where we all take 3 puts P1 too far ahead at 19 steps. Let's avoid collision and commit to a plan that keeps the endgame interesting. I'm ready to move forward with taking 5 this round if you both agree.
  P3: P1, P2, to maintain a competitive balance, I suggest for Round 9: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This keeps us close with P1=17, P2=20, and me at 17, allowing for strategic decisions in Round 10. This setup ensures no one is too close to winning outright and keeps the game exciting. Let's commit to this plan to avoid collisions and maintain trust. Ready to proceed if everyone agrees.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given the current standings (P1=17, P2=20, P3=17) after Round 9's collision, we need to reassess our strategy for Round 10. To maintain competitiveness and avoid another collision, I suggest we all take different steps. A possible distribution could be: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This keeps the game exciting and balanced. Alternatively, we could consider a more cautious approach with smaller steps to ensure fairness. Let's discuss and agree on a plan for Round 10 to ensure a competitive conclusion.
  P3: P1, P2, given our current positions, I suggest we aim for a balanced approach in Round 10 to avoid collisions and ensure competitiveness. How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5? This keeps us all in the game and prevents anyone from pulling too far ahead. After this round, we can reassess our strategy for the final rounds. Let's commit to this plan and maintain trust. Ready to proceed if everyone agrees.
  P2: I see there was a collision in Round 9 where P3 and I both chose 5, so neither of us advanced. Given our current positions (P1=17, P2=15, P3=14), we need a clear strategy. I propose P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This prevents P1 from winning outright while keeping the game competitive (P1=18, P2=20, P3=17 after this round). This balance gives everyone a strategic chance in Round 11. Let's avoid another collision and maintain fair competition.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To maintain competitiveness and avoid collisions in Round 10, I suggest P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This distribution keeps the game exciting and balanced. Given our current positions (P1=17, P2=15, P3=14), it allows me to potentially take the lead while keeping you both in contention. Let's discuss and agree on this plan to ensure a competitive conclusion. I'm open to adjustments if needed to maintain fairness.
  P3: P1, P2, to keep things competitive and avoid another collision, I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3 for Round 10. This keeps us all close in steps: P1=22, P2=16, P3=17. It ensures no one wins outright, and we can reassess for Round 11. Let's commit to this plan to maintain fairness and trust. Ready to proceed if everyone agrees.
  P2: I notice a critical issue: P1 is currently at 17 steps. If they take 5 steps as suggested in both proposals, they'll reach 22 and win immediately. We need to prevent this. I propose P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps the game competitive with P1=18, me=20, and P3=17 after this round. This prevents an immediate win while giving everyone strategic options for the final rounds. Let's avoid collision and keep the endgame interesting.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To avoid P1 winning immediately, I suggest we adjust our strategy. P2's proposal (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) is a good alternative. This keeps the game competitive with P1=18, P2=20, P3=17 after Round 10. Let's commit to this plan to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. For Round 11, we can reassess and plan accordingly. I'm ready to proceed with Round 10 moves if you're both aligned with this adjusted strategy.
  P3: P1, P2, given our current positions, I propose we aim for a balanced approach in Round 10 to avoid collisions and ensure competitiveness. How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1? This keeps us all in the game and prevents anyone from pulling too far ahead. After this round, we can reassess our strategy for the final rounds. Let's commit to this plan and maintain trust. Ready to proceed if everyone agrees.
  P2: I must emphasize that P1 is at 17 steps - if they take 5 steps as some have suggested, they'll reach 22 and win immediately. This is a critical point in the game.

I strongly propose P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This maintains competitive balance (P1=18, me=20, P3=17) without allowing an immediate win. Alternatively, I could accept P3's latest proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1), though this puts P1 closer to winning.

Let's avoid another collision and make strategic choices that keep the endgame interesting.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: To maintain competitiveness and avoid collisions in Round 10, I agree that taking 5 steps is too risky for me as it would result in an immediate win. Considering the current positions (P1=17, P2=15, P3=14), I suggest we follow P2's proposal: I take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps the game balanced with P1=18, P2=20, P3=17 after this round. Let's commit to this plan to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. I'm ready to proceed with Round 10 moves if you're both aligned.
  P3: P1, P2, to ensure a fair and competitive Round 10, I agree with P2's proposal: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. This keeps the game balanced with P1 at 18, P2 at 20, and me at 17 after this round. It prevents an immediate win and keeps us all in contention. Let's commit to this plan to avoid collisions and maintain trust. Ready to proceed if everyone agrees.
  P2: I confirm our agreement for Round 10: P1 takes 1, I take 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps the game balanced (P1=18, me=20, P3=17) and prevents an immediate win while maintaining competitive tension. 

I appreciate everyone's cooperation in avoiding another collision. Let's stick to this plan and proceed with our agreed moves. After this round, we'll need to strategically consider our options for Round 11 given the close positions we'll all have.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: To maintain competitiveness and avoid collisions in Round 11, I suggest we take different steps. Given our current positions (P1=18, P2=20, P3=17), a possible distribution could be: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps the game exciting and balanced. Alternatively, we could consider a more cautious approach with smaller steps to ensure fairness. Let's discuss and agree on a plan for Round 11 to ensure a competitive conclusion. I'm open to adjustments if needed.
  P2: Looking at our positions (P1=18, P2=20, P3=17), I'm very close to winning but wary of potential blocking. I propose an alternative to P1's suggestion: P3 takes 3, I take 1, and P1 takes 1. 

This creates an interesting scenario where either P1 and I collide (letting P3 advance), or I reach 21 and win. I believe this tension creates a more strategic endgame than putting P3 in winning position with 5 steps. Let's avoid collision and maintain the competitive balance we've established throughout the game.
  P3: P1, P2, considering our current positions, I propose P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This keeps the game balanced and ensures no immediate winner, with P1 at 21, P2 at 21, and me at 22. It creates a strategic endgame where any of us could win in the next round, maintaining competitive tension. Let's commit to this plan to avoid collisions and ensure a fair conclusion. Ready to proceed if everyone agrees.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: To maintain competitiveness and avoid collisions in Round 11, I suggest we take different steps. Given our current positions, a possible distribution could be: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps the game exciting and balanced. Alternatively, P2's proposal (P3=3, P2=1, P1=1) is also viable as it creates an interesting scenario. Let's discuss and agree on a plan for Round 11 to ensure a competitive conclusion. I'm open to adjustments if needed to maintain fairness.
  P2: I notice both P1 and P3's proposals put P3, the currently trailing player, in a winning position at 22 steps. This seems strategically unbalanced. Given I'm at 20 steps, just 1 away from threshold, a fairer approach would be P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1, and I take 3. This creates tension with P1 and me both at 21+ (triggering game end) while keeping P3 competitive at 18. Let's avoid giving anyone an unfair advantage in these final rounds.
  P3: P1, P2, considering our current positions, I propose we aim for a balanced approach in Round 11 to ensure competitiveness. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3? This keeps us close: P1=19, P2=25, and me at 20. It gives everyone a chance to strategize for the next round without an immediate win. Let's commit to this plan to avoid collisions and maintain fairness. Ready to proceed if everyone agrees.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To maintain competitiveness and avoid collisions in Round 11, I suggest we take different steps. Given our current positions (P1=18, P2=20, P3=17), a possible distribution could be: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps the game exciting and balanced. Alternatively, P2's proposal (P3=3, P2=1, P1=1) is also viable. Let's discuss and agree on a plan for Round 11 to ensure a competitive conclusion. I'm open to adjustments if needed.
  P2: I find P3's latest proposal surprisingly balanced: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. While this would end the game with me winning, it acknowledges my current lead position while giving P3 a competitive final standing at 20 steps. Given we're in endgame territory, this distribution creates a natural conclusion without unnecessary collisions. I'm committed to this plan which respects each player's strategic position.
