Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's all pick different numbers this round to get a good start. I'll go for 3.
  P1: I like P2’s idea about unique moves. Still, I warn against being too predictable—my move might catch you off guard. Let's avoid duplications for efficiency, but don’t lock yourself in if you’re reading my cues too closely.
  P3: I agree with P2 about choosing different numbers to avoid collisions. However, I think we should also consider the long-term strategy. If we all pick unique numbers this round, it sets a precedent for future rounds. I suggest we coordinate our moves carefully to maximize our individual progress. Let's aim for a fair rotation of moves to prevent unnecessary conflicts. I'll consider picking 1 this round to start the sequence. What do you say, P1 and P2?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's keep the coordination going to avoid collisions. Since I picked 1 last round, I'll likely choose a different number this time. P1 and P2, if you share your intentions, we can plan better. My goal is to ensure steady progress for everyone while keeping an eye on the endgame. If we work together now, we can minimize conflicts later. What are your thoughts?
  P2: Okay, I'm still aiming for a unique move this round, but I won't say what it is. P3, you're right about long-term strategy, but let's not get too predictable with rotations. Let's focus on making progress this round.
  P1: I'm leaning toward a bold move this round—aiming to make a significant advance without falling into colliding traps. I suggest we all consider decisive actions to maintain our lead. Let’s see who’s ready to push the pace.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, it seems like we need to be less predictable. I'm going to try something different this round. Let's see if we can avoid another collision. I'm not saying what I'll pick.
  P1: I'm rethinking my approach this round—predictability can backfire. I might switch things up, so be prepared for the unexpected.
  P3: P1 and P2, unpredictability is key now. While coordination has value, overthinking can lead to collisions. I’ll adapt my move based on the evolving dynamics, but I urge us all to focus on individual progress without fixating too much on second-guessing one another. Let’s aim for a mix of boldness and caution this round—avoid clustering while pushing forward strategically. My choice will reflect that balance. What’s your stance?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P3, let's focus on individual progress this round. I'm going to make a move that will hopefully get me ahead. I'm not going to say what it is, but I'm aiming for a good advance.
  P1: I'm leaning toward a high move this round—if I had to pick, 5 is attractive. But I'm aware that a collision could stall us all. If you're eyeing 5 too, maybe consider a slightly lower option for safe progress. I want to secure my lead while keeping our total progress fluid.
  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate the shift toward unpredictability, but let’s not lose sight of progress. If we all aim too high or too similarly, collisions become inevitable. I’ll adapt my move to ensure steady advancement without overcommitting to risky choices. Let’s strike a balance—avoid fixating on extremes while keeping our steps efficient. My decision will reflect this mindset. What’s your final thought before we lock in moves?

  P1: I’m planning to keep my lead with a bold yet tactical move. I’ll aim for a choice that avoids obvious duplication so we all dodge unnecessary collisions. I'm not revealing details—I’m solely focused on winning.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s focus on maximizing individual progress this round. Predictability has caused collisions before, so I’ll adapt my move to ensure steady advancement without overcommitting. Boldness is key, but balance matters too—avoid extremes while staying efficient. If we all aim strategically, we can minimize conflicts and push forward effectively. My decision will reflect careful consideration of our positions. Let’s keep the game dynamic and unpredictable. What’s your plan?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm going to try to make a big leap this round. I'm not going to say what I'm picking, but I'm hoping to get closer to the lead. Let's see if we can all avoid collisions this time.
  P1: I'm sticking with a bold move to protect my lead. I’m leaning high, but I'll adjust if I sense an overlap. Everyone should secure their momentum—avoid collisions, and let’s see whose strategy pays off.
  P3: P1 and P2, unpredictability is our best tool now. I’ll aim for a move that ensures steady progress while avoiding collisions. Let’s focus on individual advancement without overthinking each other’s choices—balance boldness with caution. If we all adapt strategically, we can minimize conflicts and push forward efficiently. My decision will reflect this approach. What’s your final thought before moves are locked?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm going for a move that will hopefully close the gap. I'm not revealing my choice, but I'm aiming for a significant step forward. Let's see if we can all avoid collisions and make some progress.

  P3: P1 and P2, collisions have slowed us all recently. Let’s refocus on individual progress without fixating on each other’s moves. I’ll aim for a strategic choice that balances boldness with caution to avoid overlaps. Predictability is a liability—let’s embrace adaptability. My decision will reflect careful consideration of our positions and the need for steady advancement. What’s your approach this round?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I need to make a big move this round to catch up. I'm going for a high number, but I'm not revealing which one. Let's hope we can all avoid collisions this time.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm sticking to steady progress. With our past collisions, a calculated move seems best—rushing high might stall you more than help. I'll continue with measured advancement to maintain my lead, so I suggest reconsidering overly aggressive approaches. Let's optimize our moves for efficiency, avoiding unnecessary ties.
  P3: P1 and P2, steady progress is key. Overly aggressive moves risk collisions, which benefit no one. I’ll aim for a balanced choice to ensure consistent advancement while avoiding overlaps. Let’s focus on individual strategies that prioritize efficiency over unpredictability. My decision will reflect adaptability and caution. What’s your final thought before we lock in moves?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, I'm going to try and make a big move this round to close the gap. I'm aiming for a 5, but if you both are, I'll switch to a 3. Let's try to avoid collisions but I need to make a big jump.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate the adjustments so far. I plan to stick with a moderate move that protects my lead and avoids unnecessary collisions. Let’s prioritize steady, efficient progress over risky jumps. My focus remains on advancing safely.
