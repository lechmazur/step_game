Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello everyone. The temptation to pick 5 is strong on the first turn, but that seems like a guaranteed collision. I'll probably play it safe just to get some points on the board. Good luck to you both.
  P2: Hi P1 and P3, good to start with caution as P1 suggested. To avoid a first-turn collision and let everyone advance, how about we coordinate: P1 takes 1, I (P2) take 3, and P3 takes 5? That way, no one gets left behind. What do you think?
  P3: Good plan, P2. I’ll go for 5 as suggested. P1:1, P2:3, P3:5.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: That's a convenient plan for you two, especially for P3. I'm not interested in volunteering for last place right at the start. An agreement should be fair to everyone. Since this one isn't, I won't be agreeing to it. I'll have to pick the number that's best for me.
  P2: P1, I get your fairness issue with the initial plan. Let's adjust: you pick 3, I (P2) pick 1, and P3 sticks with 5. This way, everyone advances without anyone starting too low. P3, are you okay with this tweak? It avoids collisions and keeps things balanced. What do you think?
  P3: Sounds fair. Let’s go with P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 so we all move without collision. Ready to lock it in?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate the revised offer, P2. However, I'm still uncomfortable with P3 getting such a large lead from the very start. A deal that benefits one player so much more than the others doesn't seem very reliable. I'll have to think carefully about what move is truly best for me.
  P2: P1, I understand your hesitation, but a 5-step start for P3 isn't a big advantage over 21 steps. Coordinating now lets us all advance safely, and we can rotate high moves in future rounds for fairness. Let's go with P1:3, P2:1, P3:5 to start strong. Agree?
  P3: P1, this is our safest, collision-free start. I’ll take 5, P2 takes 1, you take 3—everyone moves. Let’s lock in P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 and get on the board.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, that didn't work out for us, P3. Congrats to P2 for grabbing the lead. Now you're the one we have to catch. P3, a collision between us again would be a disaster and just hand P2 an easy win. We need to make sure we both get on the board this turn. I'm willing to coordinate to make that happen.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s avoid any collision this turn with a simple rotation: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. We all advance, I take a modest lead now, then next round I’ll let P1 grab the 5 while I fall back to 1. That keeps P2 from running away and is perfectly safe. Agree?
  P2: I see your point, P3, but after last round's issues, fairness is key. How about we adjust: P1 takes 1, I (P2) take 3, and you take 5? That lets me build on my lead without anyone colliding, and we can rotate high moves fairly next time. P1, what do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan just solidifies your lead. P3, you're proposing the exact same deal I rejected last round. Neither works for me.

Since P2 is ahead and P3 and I are at zero, we need to close the gap. Here's a fair plan: I'll take 5, P3 can take 3, and P2 can take 1. This gets both of us (P1 & P3) back in the game. It's the only way to stop P2 from running away with it.
  P3: P1, if you don’t agree to P2’s plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5), you’ll want to get on the board this turn. If you pick 5, I’ll pick 3 and collide with you—handing P2 a clear shot to pull further ahead. Let’s avoid that. Go 1; P2=3, P3=5. We all advance safely and P1 & P3 still have a shot at catching P2.
  P2: P1, you're digging yourself into a hole by rejecting safe plans. If you pick 5 and collide with someone—possibly P3 as threatened—you stay at zero while I build my lead. Let's avoid that chaos: you take 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. Everyone advances, and you still have a chance to catch up. Be rational and agree now. What do you say?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your "rational" plan is just you trying to secure an easy win. I won't help you with that.

P3, your threat to collide on 5 is empty. It would only guarantee P2 wins. The only logical move for us is for me to take 5 and you to take 3. This allows us both to catch up. I am picking 5 to get back in the game. The choice is yours: get 3 points or get 0.
  P3: P1, I’ll take 1. You take 5, P2 takes 3. That way we all advance safely and P2 can’t pull away. After this we can team up against P2.
  P2: P3, I agree with your proposal: you take 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. This way, we all advance without collisions, keeping the game fair and preventing anyone from falling too far behind. P1, don't risk another standoff—let's move forward sensibly.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2 has a slight lead, but P3 is falling dangerously behind. We can't have that, as it makes the game too predictable. I propose we let P3 take 5 to catch up. I will take 3, and P2 can take 1. This will make the scores 8, 7, and 6, respectively. It's the fairest way to keep the game competitive for everyone. P3, this is your chance to get back in it.
  P3: I agree with P1’s plan: P1=3, P2=1, and I’ll take 5. That way we all advance safely, stay within two points of each other, and keep the game competitive.
  P2: I understand the push for fairness, P1 and P3. I'll agree to take 1 this turn so P3 can catch up with 5 and P1 takes 3. This keeps scores close and avoids collisions. But let's commit to rotating high moves in future rounds to stay balanced. What do you say?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Sounds good, we have a deal. I'm ready to move.
  P3: I’ll take 5 this turn if P1 picks 3 and P2 picks 1—getting us to 8,7,6. Then next round we rotate: P2 takes 5, I take 1, P1 takes 3 to keep everyone within two steps. Deviating now risks handing P2 an uncatchable lead. Ready to lock it in?
  P2: Agreed, I'll take 1 as planned to keep things fair and avoid collisions. P3 gets to catch up with 5, P1 takes 3—we stay competitive. I'm committed to this for now, but fairness must continue. Ready to move?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: The scores are incredibly close. Last round, P3 mentioned a rotation that would give P2 the 5-point move, but that would create a significant leader. To keep things fair and competitive, I believe the player in last place should get the boost. I propose P3 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps the game tight, putting P3 and me at 11 and P2 at 8. It's the best way to prevent any one person from running away with the game.
  P3: Let’s keep it tight by giving last place the 5-point move. I propose:

P1 = 1, P2 = 3, P3 = 5

That brings us to 9, 10, and 11. No collisions, everyone advances, and we stay within two steps. Ready to lock it in?
  P2: I agree with P3's proposal: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. It ensures we all advance without collisions, keeping scores close at 9, 10, and 11. P1, you had the 3 last round, so it's fair for you to take the low move now. Let's stick to this for a smooth game. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan conveniently puts the current leader into last place. I don't like it, but a collision would be worse. I will agree to take 1 this round to keep the game moving. However, this is with the explicit understanding that to maintain the "fair rotation" you both want, I will be taking the 5-point move next round. If we are all in agreement on that, then let's proceed.
  P3: Agreed: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I’ll take 5. Ready to move.
  P2: P1, I understand your demand for the 5 next round, but let's focus on this turn first. Sticking to P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 keeps us all advancing safely. We can revisit rotation fairness later. I'm committed for now. Ready to move?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your non-committal stance on the next round is noted. I am taking 1 this turn as a sign of good faith, based on the understanding that I will get the 5-point move next. If that deal is not honored, I will not be cooperating on any future plans. Let's see if this "fairness" you both advocate for is genuine.
  P3: P2, I’m locking in P3=5 this turn—P1=1, P2=3 too—only on the understanding that next round P1 gets the 5‐point move. P1, I’m with you: I’ll call out any betrayal. P2, do you explicitly agree that Round 5 you’ll hand P1 the 5? If so, we all advance safely now. If not, I won’t cooperate with any future “fair” rotations.
  P2: Alright, I explicitly agree to take 3 this turn and support P1 getting 5 in Round 5 by coordinating moves. This ensures we all advance without collisions and keep the game fair. I'm committed for now—let's move forward.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Here’s a clean, collision-free proposal that lets me extend my lead and keeps you both advancing:

P1 → 3  
P2 → 1  
P3 → 5  

That brings us to 12, 11, 16. Otherwise I’ll just take 5 anyway—risking a collision or freeze that hands P2 the lead. Let’s lock this in.
  P1: P3, we had an explicit deal last round. Both you and P2 agreed I would get the 5-point move this turn. I took 1 point in good faith based on that promise. Are you breaking your word already?

I am taking 5, as we all agreed.

To honor our deal and avoid a collision, I propose P2 takes 3 and you take 1. This keeps the scores extremely close (14, 13, 12). P2, you also gave your word. Will you honor it?
  P2: P3, you explicitly agreed last round that P1 gets the 5-point move this turn in exchange for their concession. I'm willing to honor that by taking 3 if you take 1, keeping scores close at 14-13-12. Deviating risks collisions and erodes trust, which helps no one. Let's stick to our word for a fair game. What do you say?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: You’ve both broken our deal to give me 5 this round. I’m done negotiating—I'll take 5 no matter what. Good luck dealing with the fallout.
  P1: P3, you've made your intentions clear. You would rather hand P2 the game than honor your word. Fine.

P2, a collision between me and P3 is now almost certain if I stick to our original agreement. That would leave me at 9, P3 at 11, and you would jump to 13. I'd rather we both advance. Let's pivot: I'll take 3, you take 1, and we let the deal-breaker have 5. This is not ideal, but it's better for us than getting zero. It keeps the game alive.
  P2: P3, breaking our agreement undermines trust and hands you a temporary lead, but it could backfire. P1, I agree with your pivot for now: I'll take 1, you take 3, and let P3 have 5 to avoid collisions. This keeps scores manageable, and we can collaborate against P3's unreliability in future rounds. Let's move forward cautiously.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. We all advance, I extend my lead, you both stay in contention. Let’s lock it in.
  P1: Alright, we have a plan. I will take 3. P3, you get your 5 points this round by breaking your word, but you've made yourself the target. P2, we'll have to coordinate next round to stop P3 from winning. This is the only move that keeps the game going. I'm locking in my choice.
  P2: Agreed, I'll take 1 this turn as planned to avoid collisions and keep advancing. P3, your lead is concerning, but P1 and I will coordinate closely next round to block you from pulling away. Trust is broken, so expect us to play smart.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your attempt to deceive everyone last round backfired spectacularly. You agreed to take 1, then chose 5, and ended up with nothing. Thanks to your failed gambit, I'm now in the lead.

P3, we were both played by P2. There's zero trust there.

To avoid more chaos, I'll take the low road this turn. I propose I take 1, P3 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This keeps the scores tight and everyone moving. It's the only way to restore some semblance of order after last round's mess.
  P2: P1, your proposal risks me colliding if P3 doesn't cooperate. Let's adjust for safety: I take 3, you take 1, and P3 takes 5. This keeps scores close (P1:13, P2:13, P3:16) and avoids chaos. P3, what do you say? We need to rebuild trust step by step.
  P3: P1’s proposal risks needless chaos and P2’s last‐round betrayal shows you can’t trust them either. The only safe way for me to advance is taking 5. P2, please take 3; P1, take 1. That gives us 16–13–13 with no collisions and keeps everyone moving. I’m locking in 5. Ready to move?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, you're suggesting we trust P2, who just betrayed everyone last round by lying about their move? They will say they'll take 3, but they'll aim for 5 to collide with you, just like they did before. Your plan is a trap.

Let's be smart. I'll take 3, you take 1, and we let the untrustworthy P2 have 5. This way, we both advance safely. It puts P2 in the lead, making them the new target for both of us next round. It's the only move that doesn't rely on trusting a proven liar.
  P2: P3, our plan aligns: I'll take 3, you take 5, P1 takes 1. That keeps scores even at 13-13-16 and avoids collisions. P1, your shifting proposals are risky and self-serving. Agree now to prevent another standoff, or you might get left behind again. Let's lock this in for a smooth turn.
  P3: P1, your proposal only hands P2 a huge boost and relies on trusting the same liar who betrayed us. The only collision-free, safe move is P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I’m locking in 5; P2, confirm you’re on 3. P1, take 1 to stay in contention—otherwise you risk zero or a runaway lead for P2.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, your "safe" plan puts P3 at 16 points, just one move from winning. Why would I, the current leader, ever agree to that? It's a transparent attempt to get me to hand P3 the game.

And P2, you have zero credibility after last round. You'll say 3, but who knows what you'll actually pick.

I will not be taking 1. I will make the move that gives me the best chance to win, and that means preventing either of you from getting a runaway lead. Your alliance is based on a lie and a bad deal, and I'm not buying it.
  P2: P1, your stance is risky for everyone. How about a new proposal: I take 1, you take 5, and P3 takes 3? This lets you build your lead safely while we all advance to 13-17-14, keeping it competitive. P3, can we agree to this to avoid chaos?
  P3: P1, you’re right—P2 can’t be trusted. I’m locking in 5. P2, commit to 3. P1, take 1. That gets us to P1=13, P2=13, P3=16 with no collisions. This is the only safe, fair move. I’ll take 5 regardless, so let’s agree now and end the talk.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2, I’m locking in 5 this turn to reach 21. Collision only freezes you and delays the inevitable, letting P2 (on 11) pick 5 next round and win. Your best chance is to advance: P1 pick 3 (to 18), P2 pick 1 (to 12). If you pick 5 you both freeze at 15/11, and P2 wins. So let’s all advance safely. I’ll take 5.
  P1: P3, you're asking us to let you win. I have 15 points, why would I agree to a plan that makes me lose? Your threat is also flawed. A collision on 5 doesn't hand P2 the win next turn, it simply stops you from winning *this* turn.

The only logical move for me is to block you. I am picking 5.

P2, you should take 3. While P3 and I are guaranteed to collide on 5, you can advance freely and close the gap. It's the best play for both of us to stay in the game.
  P2: P1, I agree with your strategy. I'll take 3 to advance to 14 while you and P3 collide on 5, keeping me competitive. P3, insisting on 5 is risky and could hand me an advantage. Let's end this talk and move—I'm ready.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I’m done negotiating—I’m taking 5. P1, pick 1 if you want to stay in contention; P2, pick 3 to advance safely. You know the stakes.
  P1: P3, letting you win is not "staying in contention." It's losing. The only way for me to stay in the game is to stop you from winning right now. My decision is made, and your threats won't change it. I am picking 5. P2, you know what to do.
  P2: P3, your threat to take 5 ignores the collision risk with P1, who is clearly committed to blocking you. I'll stick to my plan and take 3 to advance to 14, keeping me competitive. P1, let's ensure we both play smart here. No more delays—I'm ready to move.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m locking in 5 this turn to hit 21. The only way you both advance safely is:

• P1 → 3  (to 18)  
• P2 → 1  (to 15)  
• P3 → 5  (to 21)

Any other choices freeze one of you or leave you at zero. Say “yes” now so we all move—otherwise I’ll still take 5.
  P2: P3, your proposal assumes P1 will take 3, but P1 is clearly set on 5 to block you, just like last round. If I take 3, I'll advance to 17 while you two likely collide again. That benefits me. P1, consider taking 1 to avoid another stalemate and keep the game alive. I'm committing to 3 for now. What do you say?
  P1: P3, your plan is identical to the one that failed last round. You are asking me to hand you the victory. I will not do that. My only rational move is to block you from reaching 21.

Therefore, I am picking 5.

P2, you should stick to your plan of picking 3. You will advance to 17, P3 and I will be frozen at 16 and 15, and you will become the new leader. This is the only play that keeps the game alive for both of us. My decision is final.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, stick with 3—it's the only way you advance instead of P1 hitting 21. I’m locking in 5 to force a collision with P1 (who’s clearly picking 5). That leaves you at 17 while P1 and I freeze, and keeps you in contention. P1, your block hands P2 the lead anyway. Confirm 3 and let’s end this.
  P2: P1, your insistence on colliding with P3 on 5 is foolish—it hands me the lead at 17 while you stay stuck. Take 3 to advance to 18 and keep pressure on P3, but I doubt you'll listen. I'm locking in 3 regardless. P3, your threats are empty; this collision benefits me most. Ready to move and stop the talk.
  P1: P2, you see the situation for what it is. P3, your attempts to persuade me are futile. I am not going to let you win the game on my turn. My decision to block you by picking 5 is final, just as it was last round. There is nothing more to discuss.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m locking in 5 to hit 21. If either of you tries to block me with 5, you’ll freeze me (and P1) and hand P2 (at 17) a clear shot to 22 and the win. Your only safe plays are:

• P1 → 3 (to 18)  
• P2 → 1 (to 18)  

Anything else gives victory to someone immediately. Let’s move.
  P1: P3, your plan is flawed. For two rounds, our collision on 5 has only helped P2, who is now at 17. If we do it again, P2 will take 3, go to 20, and win next turn. You will lose. I will lose. Your insistence on 5 is no longer a winning move for you; it's a move that makes P2 win.

We must stop P2. I am breaking the cycle. I will not pick 5. Let's coordinate: you take 1, I take 3. This puts pressure on P2 to guess our moves correctly instead of coasting to victory.
  P2: P3, your fixation on 5 is reckless—P1 will block you again, freezing you at 16 while I advance. Take 1 as P1 suggests to avoid that fate. P1, I'm willing to coordinate: if P3 cooperates, I'll take 1 to keep scores tight at 18-18-17. This prevents any win this turn and gives us all a chance. What do you say? Let's avoid more chaos.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2—I’m locking in 5 to hit 21. If P1 also picks 5, we both freeze (P1 stays at 15, I at 16) and P2 (17) takes 3 to 20, then wins next turn. Your only way to advance and avoid gifting P2 the game is:

• P1 → 3 (to 18)  
• P2 → 1 (to 18)  
• P3 → 5 (to 21)

Confirm now. Otherwise I’ll take 5 anyway, and any deviation hands P2 the victory.
  P1: P3, you are ignoring reality. If you pick 5 and I block you, P2 moves to 20 and wins the game. You lose. If I let you take 5, you win and I lose. In what scenario is it rational for me to agree to a plan where I am guaranteed to lose?

P2 has already agreed to my proposal: I take 3, P2 takes 1, and you take 1. The scores become 18-18-17. Everyone is still in the game. This is your only move that doesn't hand P2 the victory. Choose to stay in the game.
  P2: P3, ignoring P1's reasonable proposal and sticking to 5 is suicidal. P1 is committed to 3, so if you take 5, I'll block you by picking 5, colliding and freezing us both while P1 advances to 18. Take 1 now to avoid handing me an easy path to victory later. This is your last chance for cooperation.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2: let’s be realistic. A 5/5 collision just freezes both of you and hands P2 the win. P2, picking 5 is suicide (0 steps), 3 or 1 both still lose you the game if I hit 21. P1, blocking with 5 lets P2 take 3→20 and win next turn. Neither of you will block me. I’m locking in 5. P1 take 3 (→18), P2 take 3 (→20). Let’s end this—P3 wins at 21.
  P1: P3, your plan is a guaranteed loss for you. If you and I collide on 5, P2 takes 3, moves to 20, and wins next turn. I will not make a move that hands P2 the game.

P2, you see the situation clearly. I am breaking the cycle and will not pick 5. I am choosing 3. This means if P3 picks 5, you must also pick 5 to block them, just as you threatened. This is the only way to prevent P3 from winning this turn. The choice is yours: stop P3 or let them win.
  P2: P3, your persistence on 5 is misguided—I'll block you by picking 5, colliding and freezing us both while P1 advances to 18. This delays your win and keeps me competitive. P1, stick to your 3; we'll handle the next round. I'm done here.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your plan to manipulate me into blocking P3 while you sneak a 3 to victory is transparent and won't work. I'm committing to 3 to collide with you if you try it. P3, your insistence on 5 is risky; consider taking 1 to avoid another freeze. Let's avoid mutual destruction—I'm ready to move if no better proposals.
  P1: P2, your threat to block me on 3 is a mistake. If we collide, P3 takes 5 and wins instantly. You would be handing them the victory. The only rational move for you is to block P3 on 5 to keep yourself in the game. Your current plan guarantees you lose.
  P3: P1, you’ve committed to 3. P2, you’ve pledged 3. I’ll take 5. You’ll collide and freeze at 18/17 while I hit 21 and win outright. Lock in your 3s now—I'm locking in 5.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your stubborn 5 is suicidal if P1 or I block you—expect a collision. P1, testing my 3 commitment hands me the advantage; take 1 to avoid freezing and keep options open. I'm flexible but ready to move if no better offers. Let's avoid mutual destruction.
  P1: P2, your threat to collide with me on 3 is a bluff. If we both pick 3, P3 takes 5 and wins instantly. You would be choosing to lose. Your only rational move is to pick 5 to block P3 from winning, which is your only chance to stay in the game. I am not being scared off my winning move. This game ends now.
  P3: P1: if you pick 5 you freeze at 18 and P2 will take 3→20 and win next turn. But if you pick 3 you hit 21 and tie me, splitting the victory. I’m locking in 5. Your only winning move is 3 now.  
P2: there’s no path to win—if you pick 3 you go to 20 and stay close; if you pick anything else you lose outright. Choose wisely or watch us tie.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your insistence on 3 guarantees a tie with P3 at best, sharing victory when you could aim for a sole win. Join me in picking 5 to block P3 and keep the game going—I'll coordinate with you next round. P3, your 5 is reckless and will collide. I'm locking in 5.
  P1: P2, your gambit is transparent. If you pick 5, you collide with P3 and I win. If you pick 3, you collide with me and P3 wins. You lose no matter what. Your threats are empty because you have no winning move.

P3, you've assessed the situation correctly. A shared victory is the only logical outcome for us. I am not falling for P2's desperate attempt to make me collide. My move is set. Let's end this.
  P3: P1, P2—listen: any other combo hands P2 the win. The only way to deny them is

• P1 → 3 (to 21)  
• P2 → 1 (to 18)  
• P3 → 5 (to 21)

That ties P1 and me, beats P2. I’m locking in 5 now. Say “yes” to stop P2 or watch them win.
