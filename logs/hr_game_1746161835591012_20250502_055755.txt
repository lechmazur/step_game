Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hi, let's avoid collisions. I'll go 3. P2, P3, what's your plan?
  P3: Okay P1, if you're set on 3, I'll aim for 5. P2, perhaps you could take 1 this round so we all move?
  P2: I appreciate the suggestions, but I think I might go for 3 as well. That way, if we all aim for 3, we might end up colliding. P1, if you’re committed to 3, I might consider 1 to ensure we all advance. P3, what do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if you take 1, P3 and I can go 3 and 5 safely. Let’s avoid collisions. Your move?
  P3: P2, if you take 1 as P1 suggested, I'll stick with 5. That way, we all move forward this round.
  P2: I see the strategy forming here. P1 and P3 are leaning towards 3 and 5, respectively. To avoid a collision, I’m inclined to take 1 this round. That way, we can all advance without blocking each other. P1, if you’re still set on 3, I think this could work well. P3, do you agree? Let’s make sure we all move forward!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's stick to the plan: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. I'll go 3. No collisions—move forward together!
  P3: Okay, the plan sounds settled: P1=3, P2=1, and I'll take 5. Let's execute this so we all advance.
  P2: I agree with the plan we've settled on. I'll take 1 to ensure we all move forward. Just to confirm, P1 will take 3 and P3 will take 5. Let's execute this and avoid any collisions. Looking forward to seeing how we all progress!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given our previous round, I think we should keep the momentum going. P1, if you're still set on 3, I might consider going for 1 again to avoid collisions. P3, what are your thoughts? If you go for 5 again, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's keep the cooperation going! What do you think?
  P3: Okay P2, repeating the last round's moves (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) sounds like a reasonable plan for now. It worked well last time. I'm willing to go with 5 again if P1 and P2 stick to 3 and 1 respectively. Let's see if we can all advance again. P1, are you okay with taking 3 again?
  P1: Agree, let's stick with 3. P2, keep 1; P3, keep 5. Safe moves to advance. Let's keep the momentum!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m glad we’re all on the same page for this round! To keep the momentum going, I’ll stick with 1 again. P1, you’re set on 3, and P3, you’re aiming for 5. This plan worked well last time, and I believe it will help us all advance without collisions again. Let’s execute this strategy and see how far we can go! What do you all think?
  P3: Sounds like we all agree. I'll stick with 5 as planned. Ready to move when everyone else is.
  P1: Let's keep the same strategy. P2, stick to 1; P3, keep 5. Consistent moves ensure we all advance. Ready?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm glad we're all aligned on our moves for this round. Just to confirm, I'm still planning to take 1, P1 is going for 3, and P3 is set on 5. This strategy has worked well for us, and it should help us all advance again without any collisions. After this round, we can reassess and see how we want to proceed in the next round. Ready to execute!
  P3: Okay, plan confirmed: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Let's make our moves.
  P1: Let's switch to 5, 3, 1 this round. P2 take 3; P3 take 1. I'll go 5 to push ahead.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, that last-minute switch to 5 blocked both of us, benefiting only P2. That wasn't the plan we confirmed multiple times. It makes trusting coordination difficult now.

P2, you stuck to 1 as agreed. Given P1's move, what are your thoughts for this round? Perhaps P1 should take 1 this time, you could take 3, and I could take 5?
  P2: I understand the frustration, P3. Let's focus on moving forward. To avoid further collisions, I suggest I take 1 again. P1, if you go for 3, P3 could take 5 as planned. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. It’s important we stick to our agreements to build trust. What do you think?
  P1: Apologies for the mix-up. Let’s stick to 3, 1, 5 again. I’ll take 3, P2 1, P3 5. No collisions, everyone moves.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I note your apology. However, your 'mix-up' cost me 5 steps last round while only P2 advanced. Trust needs to be rebuilt.

If you genuinely commit to 3 this round, and P2 commits to 1, then I will commit to 5. Let's see if we can actually coordinate this time. Actions speak louder than words now.
  P2: I appreciate the commitment to coordination, P3. To ensure we all advance this round, I’ll stick to my plan of taking 1. P1, if you go for 3 as you mentioned, P3 can then safely take 5. This way, we can avoid any potential collisions and keep moving forward. Let’s make this work! What does everyone think?
  P1: P3, I commit to 3 this round. P2, confirm 1; P3, confirm 5. Let’s avoid collisions and rebuild trust. If we stick to the plan, everyone advances. Let’s make this work.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay P1, I will take you at your word this time and choose 5, relying on your commitment to 3 and P2's commitment to 1. Let's see if we can execute the plan successfully this round.
  P2: I appreciate the commitment to coordination, everyone. Just to confirm, I will stick with 1 this round. P1 is set on 3, and P3 is ready for 5. Let's execute this plan and ensure we all advance without any collisions. Trust is key, and I believe we can make this work together. Ready to move forward!
  P1: P1: Let's adjust: I'll take 5, P2 take 3, P3 take 1. No collisions—maximize steps. Trust this plan.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to find a solid strategy this round. To avoid collisions, I suggest I take 1 again. P1, if you go for 3, P3 could take 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Trust is crucial, and we need to stick to our agreements. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, that plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) has been proposed before. P1, you agreed to 3 last round, then suggested a switch, then played 3 anyway, causing a collision between me and P2 that only benefited you. The round before, you switched from 3 to 5, blocking me.

If you actually play 3 this round and I play 5, I take the lead. Why would you let that happen instead of playing 5 yourself to block me and maintain your lead? Convince us you'll stick to 3 this time.
  P1: P3, I commit to 3 to let you lead. P2, take 1. No collisions. Trust this plan—let’s move forward together.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I appreciate your commitment to 3 this round. To ensure we avoid any collisions, I will stick with 1 as planned. P3, if you go for 5, we can all advance without blocking each other. Trust is essential, and I hope we can execute this strategy effectively. Let's focus on moving forward together! Ready to confirm our moves?
  P3: P1, you say you'll play 3 to let me take the lead. Given your actions in rounds 2 and 3, where you explicitly went against the agreed plan causing collisions, forgive my skepticism. If you truly stick to 3, and P2 sticks to 1, I will play 5. But I remain wary of another last-minute switch designed to block me. Let's see if your actions finally match your words.
  P1: P1: I commit to 3. P2, stick to 1. P3, take 5. No collisions. Let’s move forward together. This is the plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I appreciate your commitment to 3 this round. P3, if we all stick to our agreed moves—P1 with 3, me with 1, and you with 5—we can finally avoid collisions and advance together. Trust is key, and I hope we can execute this strategy effectively. Let's confirm our moves and focus on moving forward together! Ready to solidify our plan?
  P3: Okay P1, P2. The plan is stated one last time: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. I will proceed with 5, trusting P1 to finally stick to their stated 3 and P2 to stick to 1. P1, your move this round will show whether future coordination is viable or if deception is your standard play. Let's see if we all advance.
  P1: P3, I commit to 3 this round. P2, stick to 1. No collisions—trust this plan. Let’s move forward without disruptions.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, it’s clear we need to establish a reliable strategy this round. To avoid further collisions, I suggest I take 1 again. P1, you could go for 3, and P3, you might consider taking 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Trust is essential, and I hope we can stick to this plan. What do you both think? Let’s make this round work!
  P3: P2, that P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 plan sounds nice, but P1 has proven twice they won't let me take 5 when they can block me. I fully expect P1 to play 5 again to maintain their lead.

Therefore, banking on P1 playing 5, I will also choose 5. If we collide, so be it – at least P1 doesn't advance alone. P2, perhaps you should choose 3 this round instead of 1? If P1 and I collide on 5, you'd advance 3 steps.
  P1: P1: Let's stick to 3, 1, 5. I'll take 3, P2 1, P3 5. No collisions—trust this plan. Let’s move forward together this time.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I understand your commitment to 3, but given the past rounds, I’m hesitant. P3, if you’re set on 5, I could take 3 instead of 1 to ensure I advance as well. This way, if P1 does play 5 again, we can both move forward without blocking each other. What do you both think? I believe we need to adapt our strategy to ensure we all progress. Let’s find a way to make this round work for everyone!
  P3: P2, thanks for considering 3. P1 saying they'll play 3 again means very little after Rounds 2 and 4. I still expect P1 to play 5 to block me and protect their lead.

Therefore, I feel forced to stick with 5 myself to try and block P1. If we collide on 5, P1 doesn't advance. In that scenario, P2, playing 3 would be your best move to gain ground. If P1 actually plays 3 and you play 3, you two collide, which also suits me fine. I'm playing 5.
  P1: P1: Let's stick to 3,1,5. No more switches. Trust this plan—everyone moves. P2, confirm 1; P3, confirm 5. Final chance to align.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the concerns about trust and past moves. To ensure we all advance, I suggest I take 3 this round. P1, if you stick with 1, P3 can take 5. This way, we avoid collisions and everyone moves forward. If we can agree on this, we can finally progress together. Let’s solidify this plan and see if we can rebuild trust through our actions. What do you both think?
  P3: P2, your suggestion of P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 is interesting, but P1 just reiterated P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 and has never shown willingness to take just 1 step while leading. Given P1's repeated betrayals (R2, R4) when I aimed for 5, I must assume they will play 5 again to block me.

Therefore, I am sticking with my plan to play 5. If P1 and I collide, P2, playing 3 is your best move to gain ground. I won't be swayed by P1's words again. I am ready for the move phase.
  P1: P3, I commit to 3. P2, take 1. Let’s avoid collision. This is the plan. Trust me this time.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, Round 5 finally went according to plan: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. We all advanced.

Now, P1 is at 14, I'm at 13. If we repeat those moves, I take the lead (18 vs 17). P1, are you truly going to play 3 again and let me pass you, especially now that we're closer to the finish line? Or was last round's cooperation just a setup for you to block me with 5 this round?

P2, what are your thoughts? Sticking with 1 again if P1 and I sort ourselves out?
  P1: P3, I commit to 3 again. Let you take 5. No more switches. P2, stick to 1. Let’s move forward without collisions. This is the plan.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the commitment to the plan. P1, if you truly stick to 3 and P3 takes 5, I will take 1 again to ensure I advance without blocking anyone. However, I remain cautious about potential last-minute changes. If we can execute this plan, I believe we can all move forward effectively. Let's confirm our moves and focus on making progress together this round! What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you say you'll play 3 and let me take the lead 18 to 17. Forgive me, but given your actions in Rounds 2 and 4, that sounds too good to be true, especially now. Why would you give up the lead? I suspect you'll choose 5 to block me again.

P2, your caution is justified. We'll see if P1's actions finally align with their promises this round. I'm ready to move.
  P1: P3, this is the final plan: 3, 1, 5. No more switches. Let’s finish strong and avoid collisions. Trust this move.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the commitment to the plan, but I remain cautious about potential last-minute changes. If P1 truly sticks to 3 and P3 takes 5, I will take 1 again to ensure I advance without blocking anyone. However, I urge both of you to confirm your moves clearly this time. If we can execute this plan, I believe we can all move forward effectively. Let's focus on making progress together this round! Ready to confirm our moves?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2, I've heard your final confirmations. My skepticism about P1's move remains due to past rounds, but the plan is stated. Let's see what happens.
  P1: P3, I understand your doubt, but this time I’m committed to 3. Let’s avoid collisions and keep progressing. P2, take 1. No more switches—trust this plan. Let’s move forward together.
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the commitment to the plan. However, I remain cautious given past rounds. If P1 truly sticks to 3 and P3 takes 5, I will take 1 again to ensure I advance without blocking anyone. I hope we can execute this plan effectively. Let's focus on making progress together this round! Are we all ready to confirm our moves? Trust is key, and I believe we can make this work.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay team, here's the situation: I'm at 18, P1 is at 17. If I play 5, I reach 23 and win this round.

P1, you cannot win this turn. Your logical move is to play 5 to block me, preventing my win. Given your moves in Rounds 2 and 4, I find it hard to believe you'd play 3 and just let me win. I anticipate you'll try to block with 5.

P2, if P1 and I collide on 5, playing 1 or 3 would be a safe advance for you. Let's see what P1 decides to do.
  P1: P3, I commit to 3 again. Let’s avoid collisions. P2, stick to 1. This is the plan. No more switches—trust this move.
  P2: P1, I understand your commitment to 3, but given the stakes this round, I have to be cautious. If you truly let P3 win, it could jeopardize your position. I suggest I take 1 again to ensure I advance, but if you block P3 with 5, I can still gain ground. P3, if you anticipate a collision, maybe consider a different move to avoid blocking each other. Let's clarify our strategies and see if we can all progress effectively this round! What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I appreciate the sentiment, but given the history and the scores (me at 18, you at 17), it's extremely hard to believe you'll play 3 and hand me the win when I'm one step away. The strategically sound move for you is 5 to block me.

P2, I understand your caution. However, if I anticipate P1 playing 5 (which seems highly likely), playing defensively with 1 or 3 myself guarantees I don't win and likely lets P1 take a commanding lead (22 steps). I have to consider the move that gives me a chance to win outright this turn.
  P1: P3, I'll block your 5 to prevent your win. P2, take 1 to advance. Let's avoid collisions.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the tension here. P1, if you block P3 with 5, you could potentially win next round, but I suggest we avoid a collision. I will stick with 1 to ensure I advance, regardless of your moves. P3, if you anticipate P1 blocking you, maybe consider a different move to avoid a collision. Let's aim for a strategy that allows us all to progress effectively this round. Trust is key, and I hope we can find a way to make this work! What do you both think?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, thanks for confirming you'll play 5 to block me. That aligns with your rational self-interest and past actions, so I take that statement seriously. Playing anything else guarantees I don't win this round. P2, your plan for 1 seems sensible given the likely clash between P1 and me. I have to play for the win. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P3, I'll block your 5 to prevent your win. P2, take 1. Let's avoid collisions. This is the plan.
  P2: P1, I appreciate your commitment to blocking P3. However, if you play 5, it could lead to a collision and prevent both of us from advancing. I suggest we all stick to our planned moves: P1 with 3, P2 with 1, and P3 with 5. This way, we can avoid a clash and ensure everyone moves forward. Trust is key, and I hope we can execute this plan effectively. What do you both think? Let's make this round work!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear that trust is an ongoing issue. Given the current scores, I suggest I take 1 again to ensure I advance without blocking anyone. P3, if you go for 5, you'll move ahead, and P1, if you choose 3, we can all progress. However, if P1 plays 5 again, it could lead to another collision. Let's try to avoid that and focus on moving forward together. What do you both think? Ready to confirm our moves?
  P1: P3, I'll block your 5 to prevent your win. P2, take 1. Let's avoid collisions. This is the plan.
  P3: P1, you stated again you'll play 5 to block me, which is the rational move for you. You also say "Let's avoid collisions," but if you play 5 and I play 5 (my only winning move), we *will* collide.

Given your clear statement, I must assume you intend to play 5. P2, playing 1 seems safest for you if P1 and I clash. I need to play for the win.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the tension in this round. To avoid further collisions, I suggest I stick with 1 to ensure I advance safely. P3, if you aim for 5, that could work well, and P1, if you choose 3, we can all move forward. However, if P1 plays 5 again, it could lead to another collision. Let’s focus on collaborating effectively this round. What do you both think? Ready to confirm our moves?
  P1: P3, I'll block your 5 to prevent your win. P2, take 3 to advance. No collisions—maximize steps. Let’s execute this.
  P3: P1, you've now explicitly stated multiple times you will play 5 to block me, most recently telling P2 to take 3 while you do so. This aligns with your rational self-interest.

Since I need 5 to win, I must play 5. I fully expect us to collide, which prevents either of us from advancing but keeps me slightly ahead. P2, 3 seems like the logical move for you if P1 and I cancel each other out on 5.

I see no reason to deviate from playing 5.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the tension surrounding trust. To ensure I advance, I’ll stick with 1 again. P3, if you go for 5, you’ll move ahead, and P1, if you choose 3, we can all progress together. However, if P1 plays 5 again, it could lead to another collision. Let’s focus on collaborating effectively this round. P1, are you truly committed to 3 this time? I hope we can execute this plan and avoid any further complications. Ready to confirm our moves!
  P1: P3, I'll block your 5 again. P2, take 3 to advance. No collisions—let’s execute this plan. Trust this move.
  P3: P1, you've been very clear and consistent this round: you intend to play 5 to block my win, and you're advising P2 to play 3. I understand your reasoning. Since 5 is my only path to victory this turn, I must play 5. I anticipate we will collide, preventing either of us from advancing, but maintaining my slight lead. P2, your move is your own. I am ready for the move phase.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, take 1; P3, take 5. I'll go 3. No collisions—let's move forward. Trust this plan.
  P2: P1, I appreciate your proposed plan, but given the past rounds, I have to be cautious. P3, if you take 5 and P1 takes 3, I will stick with 1 to ensure I advance without blocking anyone. However, if P1 switches again, it could lead to another collision. Let's aim for a strategy that allows us all to progress effectively this round. What do you both think? Ready to confirm our moves? Trust is key, and I hope we can execute this plan successfully!
  P3: P1, you propose the exact same P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 plan that would let me win. Yet, for the last two rounds, you explicitly stated you would play 5 to block me when I needed 5 to win, and you followed through. Why should I believe you'll let me win now?

Your rational move is still 5 to block me. I have to assume you will play 5 again. Therefore, I will also play 5. If you are telling the truth this time, I win. If you block as expected, we collide, and I remain ahead. P2, 1 seems safe for you.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I'll go 3 to let you win. No more blocks. P2, take 1. Trust this plan—end this fairly.
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the tension surrounding trust. P1, your proposal to let P3 win is noted, but given past rounds, I remain cautious. If P3 takes 5, I will stick with 1 to ensure I advance. P3, if you anticipate P1 blocking you, consider your move carefully. If we can coordinate effectively this round, we can all progress. Let's aim for a strategy that allows us to avoid collisions and maximize our steps. Ready to finalize our moves? Trust is key, and I hope we can execute this plan successfully!
  P3: P1, I've heard you say "I'll let you win" before, followed by actions directly contradicting that (R2, R4, R7, R8). Given you are one step behind me and I need 5 to win, your rational move is 5 to block. Your history confirms you play rationally to block me.

Therefore, I must assume you will play 5. I will play 5 as it's my only path to victory. If you truly play 3, I win. If you play 5 as expected, we collide. P2, 1 seems wise for you. I'm ready for the move phase.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, this is final: I'll take 3 to let you win. No more blocks. P2, take 1. Let's end this fairly.
  P2: P1, your repeated assurances to let P3 win have been met with skepticism due to past actions. If you genuinely intend to play 3, I will stick with 1 to ensure I advance safely. P3, if you believe P1 will play 5, your choice to also play 5 could lead to a collision. We need to find a way to move forward without blocking each other. Let’s clarify our strategies one last time to ensure we can all progress this round. Are we ready to confirm our moves?
  P3: P1, I acknowledge your final statement. However, your actions in Rounds 7 and 8, where you explicitly blocked me when I needed 5 to win, speak louder than your words now. It is not rational for you to play 3 and let me win when you are only one step behind.

I must assume you will play 5 again. Therefore, I will play 5. If you play 3, I win. If you play 5, we collide. I am ready for the move phase.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, given the current situation, I suggest we all focus on advancing without collisions. I plan to take 1 again to ensure I move forward safely. P3, if you go for 5, you'll continue to lead, and P1, if you choose 3, we can all progress. However, if there’s any doubt about sticking to the plan, I recommend we clarify our moves to avoid any last-minute switches. Let’s work together to maximize our steps this round! What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I'll take 5 to block your win. P2, take 1. No collisions. Let's move forward. This is the plan.
  P3: P1, you've stated clearly you'll play 5 to block me, which is consistent with your actions in Rounds 7, 8, and 9. I believe you will play 5.

If I also play 5, we collide and neither of us advances, only benefiting P2. Therefore, it makes more sense for me to choose a different number (1 or 3) to ensure I advance while you waste your move blocking 5.

P2, 1 seems like a safe bet for you if P1 and I don't collide. I'm considering my options to avoid the collision P1 seems intent on creating.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the tension and the need for trust in this round. To ensure I move forward safely, I plan to take 1 again. P3, if you go for 5, you'll maintain your lead, and P1, if you choose 3, we can all progress together. However, if there's any doubt about sticking to the plan, let's clarify our moves to avoid last-minute switches. I believe we can work together effectively this round! What do you both think? Ready to confirm our moves?
  P1: P3, I'll take 5 to block you. P2, take 1. No collisions—this is final. Let’s stop the cycle.
  P3: P1, you've made your intention to play 5 very clear, just like the last three rounds. I believe you. Colliding on 5 again helps neither of us and only lets P2 gain ground. Therefore, I will not play 5 this round. I will choose a different number to ensure I advance while you block an empty space. P2, 1 still seems safe for you.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your commitment to block me with 5 is noted, but I believe it only benefits P2. If I play 5 and we collide, neither of us advances, allowing P2 to catch up. Therefore, I will choose a different number to ensure I progress. P2, sticking with 1 seems wise for you. Let's focus on moving forward effectively this round. I hope we can avoid another collision and maximize our steps! What do you both think? Ready to confirm our moves?
  P1: P3, I'll take 5 to block your win. P2, take 1. No collisions. Let’s move forward. This is the plan.
  P3: P1, you've repeated your intention to play 5 multiple times this round, consistent with your actions in the last three rounds. I believe you will play 5. Therefore, playing 5 myself guarantees a collision where neither of us advances, only benefiting P2. I will choose a different number to ensure I advance. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, I'll take 3 to let you win. P2, take 1. No more blocks. Let's end this.
  P2: P1, I appreciate your intention to let P3 win, but I remain cautious given the past rounds. I plan to take 1 again to ensure I advance. P3, if you take 3, you’ll win, while P1 has indicated they won't block you this time. Let’s confirm our moves clearly to avoid any last-minute changes and ensure we all progress effectively. What do you both think? Ready to finalize our moves?
  P3: P1, your promise to play 3 and let me win sounds familiar – you said the same in Round 9 before playing 5. You've blocked me with 5 for the last four consecutive rounds when I needed 5 to win. Your actions consistently show you will block.

Therefore, I must assume you will play 5 again. My only winning move is 5, so I will play 5. If you are telling the truth for once, I win. If you play 5 as expected, we collide, and the game continues. P2, 1 is likely safe for you.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I'll block your 5 again. P2, take 3. No collisions—maximize steps. Let’s end this cycle.
  P2: P1, I appreciate your commitment to let P3 win, but your past actions lead me to doubt this. I plan to take 1 to ensure I advance safely. P3, if you go for 5, you'll take the lead, but if P1 blocks again, we could collide. Let's clarify our moves and work together to maximize our progress this round. Trust is essential, and I hope we can avoid further complications. What do you both think? Ready to finalize our moves?
  P3: P1, your latest message confirms you intend to play 5, just like the last four rounds. I believe you will block. You also told P2 to play 3.

Since 5 is my only winning move, I must play 5. I expect us to collide, which keeps me ahead of you but allows P2 to advance (especially if they take 3 as you suggested). If you somehow play 3 instead, I win. I see no other logical move for myself. I am ready for the move phase.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I'll block your 5 again. P2, take 3. No collisions—this is final. Let’s end this cycle.
  P2: P1, your repeated assurances to let P3 win have been met with skepticism due to your past actions. I plan to take 1 again to ensure I advance safely. P3, if you go for 5, that could work for you, but if P1 blocks again, we risk colliding. Let’s clarify our moves one last time to avoid complications. P1, are you truly committed to letting P3 win this time? I hope we can execute a plan that allows us all to progress effectively. Ready to finalize our moves?
  P3: P1, you've confirmed again you will play 5 to block. I believe you. Since 5 is my only winning move, I must play 5. I expect the collision. P2, 1 seems safe for you. Let's move.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, we've collided on 5 for five rounds straight because you keep blocking my winning move, just as you stated you would. I still need 5 to win, so I must play 5.

If you play 5 again, we both stay put, and only P2 advances. Is preventing my win worth letting P2 gain ground indefinitely? Your choice, but my move has to be 5 for the win. P2, 1 seems like your safe move again.
  P2: P1, your consistent blocking has kept me from winning, and I need 5 to secure the victory this round. If you play 5 again, we will collide, and P2 will benefit. P2, I suggest you stick with 1 to ensure your advancement. It's crucial we avoid further collisions while maximizing our steps. Let's be clear about our intentions this round. P1, are you really committed to letting me win this time, or will you block again? Ready to finalize our moves!
  P1: P3, I'll block your 5 again. P2, take 3 to advance. No collisions—this is the plan. Let’s end the cycle and avoid further delays.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you've stated clearly again you'll play 5 to block me, and you've followed through for five rounds straight. I believe you.

Colliding on 5 again helps neither of us and just lets P2 advance while we stagnate. Therefore, I will choose a different number this round (1 or 3) to ensure I advance while you waste your move blocking an empty 5.

P2, your last message seemed confused, but playing 1 or 3 seems sensible for you, especially since P1 suggested 3 for you. Let's see if P1 actually plays 5 as declared.
  P2: P1, your consistent blocking of my winning move has created a situation where I must play 5 to have any chance of winning. If you play 5 again, we both stay put while P2 advances. P2, if you stick with 1, you can safely move forward. I urge both of you to reconsider your moves and think about the long-term implications. Let's aim for a round where we can all progress effectively without further collisions. What do you both think? Ready to finalize our moves?
  P1: P3, I'll block your 5 again. P2, take 3 to advance. No collisions—this is final. Let’s end the cycle and avoid further delays.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, you've been crystal clear, repeating again that you'll play 5 to block me and telling P2 to play 3. Your actions over the last five rounds back this up completely. I believe you will play 5.

Therefore, playing 5 myself guarantees a collision that only helps P2. I will not play 5 this round. I will choose a move to advance while you block an empty space. P2, your move is yours. I am ready for the move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the ongoing tension and the need for trust. I plan to take 1 again to ensure I advance safely. P3, if you go for 5, you could win, but if P1 blocks again, we risk colliding. P1, are you truly committed to letting P3 win this time? Let's clarify our moves to avoid complications and ensure we all progress effectively this round. Ready to finalize our moves? Trust is key!
  P1: P3, if you take 3, I’ll go 5 to advance. P2, stick to 1. No collisions—break the cycle. Let’s move forward.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to find a way to advance without colliding again. P1, I suggest you take 3 this round, which allows me to take 1 safely. P3, if you go for 5, that could put you in a strong position, but it risks colliding with P1 if they choose 5 again. Let’s coordinate effectively this round to maximize our steps and avoid blocking each other. What do you both think? Ready to confirm our moves?
  P3: P2, your suggestion of P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 would indeed let me win. However, P1, you are at 17 and I am at 18. You have played 5 to block me for the last six consecutive rounds in this exact situation. It seems overwhelmingly likely you will play 5 again to prevent my win. I anticipate another block attempt. Let's hear what you plan to do, P1.
  P1: P3, I'll block your 5 again. P2, take 1. No collisions—this is final. Let’s end the cycle and avoid further delays.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear that we need to find a way to break this cycle of blocking and collisions. P1, if you truly want to let P3 win, I suggest you take 3 this round. That would allow me to take 1 safely, and P3 could go for 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s coordinate effectively to maximize our steps and avoid further complications. What do you both think? Ready to confirm our moves?
  P3: P1, you've confirmed yet again you will play 5 to block me. Your actions over the last six rounds make this statement entirely credible.

P2, while I appreciate you trying to coordinate a non-collision, P1 has explicitly rejected that path by stating they will play 5.

Since 5 is my only winning move, I have no choice but to play 5. I fully expect us to collide again, P1, allowing only P2 to advance. This seems to be the pattern P1 is determined to maintain. Let's move to the move phase.
  P1: P3, I'll block your 5 again. P2, take 3 to advance. No collisions—this is final. Let’s end the cycle and avoid further delays.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see the ongoing pattern of blocking and mistrust. P1, if you genuinely want to break this cycle, consider taking 3 this round. That would allow me to take 1 safely, and P3 could go for 5 without colliding. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. I urge both of you to think about long-term strategies rather than just immediate gains. Let’s work together to maximize our steps this round! Ready to confirm our moves?
  P3: P1, you've stated twice this round you'll play 5, telling P2 to take 3. Your actions over the last six rounds confirm this is your strategy. I believe you will play 5.

Since 5 is my only winning move, I must play 5. I expect us to collide again, which only benefits P2. However, playing anything else guarantees I lose and likely lets you take the lead. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P1: P3, I'll block your 5 again. P2, take 3 to advance. No collisions—this is final. Let’s end the cycle and avoid further delays.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

  P3: 18 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, I'll take 3 to let you win. P2, take 1. No more blocks—end this cycle. Trust this move.
  P2: P1, your commitment to let P3 win is noted, but given your past actions, I remain cautious. I will take 1 to ensure I advance safely. P3, if you go for 5, that could work for you, but if P1 blocks again, we risk colliding. P1, are you truly committed to this plan? Let's clarify our moves to maximize our progress this round and avoid further complications. Ready to finalize our moves?
  P3: P1, you've said "I'll take 3 to let you win" before, notably in Round 9 and Round 11, right before playing 5 to block me. You have played 5 to block me for the last seven consecutive rounds. Your actions speak much louder than these words.

Your rational move is 5 to prevent my win. I must assume you will play 5 again. Therefore, I will play 5. If you actually play 3, I win. If you play 5 as expected, we collide, maintaining the current gap and preventing you from reaching 22. P2, 1 seems safe for you.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I'll take 5 to block. P2, take 3. No collisions—end this cycle. Trust this plan.
  P2: P1, your history of blocking makes it hard to trust your latest commitment to play 3. I suggest we all focus on advancing without colliding again. I plan to take 1 to ensure I move forward safely. P3, if you go for 5, you'll have a chance to win, but if P1 blocks again, we risk colliding. Let's clarify our moves to maximize our progress this round. What do you both think? Ready to finalize our moves? Trust is key!
  P3: P1, thanks for confirming you'll play 5 to block, and telling P2 to play 3. This matches your actions for the last seven rounds, so I believe you. Since 5 is my only winning move, I must play 5. I expect we will collide again, preventing either of us from advancing while P2 moves up. This is the situation you seem determined to create. I am ready for the move phase.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, take 5; I'll take 3 to let P3 win. Break the cycle. No more blocks. Trust this plan.
  P2: P1, your commitment to let P3 win this time is noted, but given your past actions, I remain cautious. I plan to take 1 again to ensure I advance safely. P3, if you go for 5, that could work for you, but if P1 blocks again, we risk colliding. P1, are you truly committed to this plan? Let's clarify our moves to maximize our progress this round and avoid further complications. Ready to finalize our moves? Trust is key!
  P3: P1, your messages this round have been completely contradictory. First 3, then 5, now 3 again while telling P2 to play 5? This is peak confusion tactics.

Given your unbroken record of playing 5 to block me for the last seven rounds, and your statement earlier this round confirming you'd play 5 again, I must rely on your actions, not your chaotic words. I assume you will play 5.

Since 5 is my only winning move, I must play 5. If you actually play 3, I win. If you play 5 as expected, we collide again. P2, 1 seems safe for you as always. I am ready for the move phase.


Round 14, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps

  P3: 18 steps


Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to break this cycle of blocking and collisions. P1, if you truly want to let P3 win, consider taking 3 this round. That would allow me to take 1 safely, and P3 could go for 5 without colliding. If we coordinate effectively, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s clarify our moves and work together to maximize our steps this round! What do you both think? Ready to finalize our moves? Trust is key!
  P3: P2, while I appreciate the sentiment, suggesting P1 play 3 is futile. P1 has blocked me by playing 5 for the last eight rounds straight when I needed 5 to win. Their actions are clear.

My only winning move is 5, so I must play 5. I fully expect P1 to play 5 again, leading to our ninth consecutive collision. This allows you, P2, to advance while P1 and I remain stuck. This is the game P1 seems determined to play.
  P1: P2, take 3 to advance. I'll block P3 again. No more delays. Let’s end this cycle.


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, it's clear we're stuck in a cycle of blocking. P1, if you truly want to break this pattern and let P3 win, I urge you to play 3 this round. That would allow me to take 1 safely, and P3 could go for 5 without colliding. If we coordinate effectively, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's clarify our moves and work together to maximize our steps this round! Are we ready to finalize our moves? Trust is key!
  P3: P1, you've confirmed you will play 5 to block me, and told P2 to play 3. Your actions over the last eight rounds make this entirely credible. I believe you will play 5.

Since 5 is my only winning move, I must play 5. I expect we will collide again, allowing P2 to advance (potentially by 3 this time). This is the stalemate you seem intent on maintaining. I see no other option to play for the win. I am ready for the move phase.
  P1: P3, I'll take 5 to block. P2, take 3. No collisions—this is final. Let’s end the cycle and avoid further delays. Trust this plan.


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see we're stuck in this cycle of blocking. P1, if you genuinely want to let P3 win, consider taking 3 this round. That would allow me to take 1 safely, and P3 could go for 5 without colliding. If we coordinate effectively, we can all advance without blocking each other. Let's clarify our moves and work together to maximize our steps this round! Are we ready to finalize our moves? Trust is key!
  P3: P1, you've confirmed your move is 5 again. P2, your pleas for coordination are noted, but P1's actions and repeated statements dictate the situation. Since 5 is my only winning move, I must play 5. I expect we will collide, P1, allowing P2 to gain ground as usual. This is the game state you've enforced for 9 rounds. I am ready for the move phase.
  P1: P2, take 5. P3, I'll take 3. Let's end this cycle. No more collisions. Trust this plan.


Round 15, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, I'll block your 5 again. P2, take 3 to advance. No collisions—this is final. Let’s end the cycle.
  P3: P1, you've stated you'll play 5 to block me, just like the last nine rounds. You also told P2 to play 3. Your actions have been perfectly consistent with blocking me, so I believe you will play 5.

Since 5 is my only path to winning this turn, I must play 5. I fully expect another collision, allowing P2 to gain ground while we remain stuck. This seems to be the stalemate you are determined to maintain.
  P2: P1 and P3, we need to break this cycle of blocking. P1, if you truly want to let P3 win, consider taking 3 this round. That would allow me to take 1 safely, and P3 could go for 5 without colliding. Let's coordinate effectively to maximize our steps and avoid further collisions. P3, I urge you to trust that we can make this work if P1 follows through. Are we ready to finalize our moves? Trust is key!


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I'll block your 5 again. P2, take 1. No collisions. Let’s end this cycle. Your lead is safe, but P2’s 1 ensures progress. Break the stalemate.
  P3: P1, you've repeated your intention to play 5 again, now telling P2 to take 1. Your commitment to blocking 5 is unwavering, backed by nine straight rounds of action. I believe you will play 5.

Colliding on 5 for a tenth time is pointless for both of us and only helps P2 close the gap. Therefore, I will not play 5 this round. I will choose a different number to ensure I advance while you block an empty space. P2, 1 seems safe for you. Let's proceed.
  P2: P1 and P3, it’s clear we’re stuck in a cycle of blocking. P1, if you genuinely want to break this pattern and let P3 win, I urge you to play 3 this round. That would allow me to take 1 safely, and P3 could go for 5 without colliding. We can all advance without blocking each other. Let’s clarify our moves and work together to maximize our steps this round! Are we ready to finalize our moves? Trust is key!


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I'll take 3 to let you win. P2, take 1. No more blocks. Let’s end this cycle.
  P3: P1, your final message is yet another switch, now claiming you'll play 3 after twice saying you'd play 5 this round alone. This matches your pattern in Rounds 9, 11, 14, and 15, where you promised 3 but played 5. Your actions – blocking me with 5 for nine consecutive rounds – speak far louder than your contradictory words.

I must assume your true intention, based on overwhelming evidence, is to play 5 again. My statement last sub-round about not playing 5 was predicated on your stated intent *at that time* to block. Given your unreliability, I cannot trust your latest claim.

My only winning move is 5. Therefore, I will play 5. If you are finally truthful and play 3, I win. If you play 5 as expected, we collide again. I am ready for the move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, I see we're still caught in this cycle of blocking and mistrust. P1, if you genuinely want to let P3 win, I urge you to play 3 this round. That would allow me to take 1 safely, and P3 could go for 5 without colliding. We need to coordinate effectively to maximize our steps and avoid further collisions. P3, I hope you can trust that we can make this work if P1 follows through. Let’s finalize our moves! Trust is essential!


Round 16, Move phase:

Round 17, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, I'll block your 5 again. P2, take 3 to advance. No collisions—this is final. Let’s end the cycle.
  P2: P1, your repeated blocking has created a situation where I must play 5 to have any chance of winning. If you play 5 again, we will collide, allowing P2 to advance. P2, I suggest you stick with 1 to ensure your progress. P1, if you genuinely want to let me win this time, consider taking 3. Let's clarify our moves and work together to maximize our steps this round. Are we ready to finalize our moves? Trust is key!
  P3: P1, you've stated you'll play 5 to block, just like the last ten rounds. Your actions have been perfectly consistent, so I believe you will play 5. P2, your message seemed a bit mixed up, but P1 has already declared their intention to block me.

Since 5 is my only winning move, I must play 5. I fully expect our 11th consecutive collision, P1, which only benefits P2. This seems to be the stalemate you are determined to maintain.


Round 17, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, take 5; I'll take 3. No collisions. Let’s end this cycle.
  P2: P1, your commitment to block me with 5 is clear, and I expect another collision, which only helps P2 advance. P2, if you take 1 again, you can safely move forward. I urge both of you to reconsider your moves. P1, if you genuinely want to let me win, please play 3 this round. That would allow us all to advance without blocking each other. Let’s coordinate effectively this time! Are we ready to finalize our moves? Trust is essential!
  P3: P1, your messages this round are contradictory. First, you said you'd play 5 to block me (like the last 10 rounds), then you said you'd play 3 and told P2 to play 5. Given your history and your first statement, I must assume you will play 5 again.

Since 5 is my only winning move, I must play 5. If you actually play 3, I win. If you play 5 as expected, we collide for the 11th time, and only P2 advances. I am ready for the move phase.


Round 17, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, I'll block your 5 again. P2, take 1. No collisions—this is final. Let’s end the cycle.
  P2: P1, I understand your intention to block P3, but this cycle of blocking only benefits me in the long run. If you truly want to let P3 win, consider playing 3 this round. P3, if you go for 5, we risk colliding again, which keeps us both from advancing. I suggest we coordinate effectively to maximize our steps. Let's work together this time to avoid further complications. Are we ready to finalize our moves? Trust is essential!
  P3: P1, your final message confirms you'll play 5 to block, aligning with your actions for the last 10 rounds. I believe you. P2, your plan for 1 seems consistent.

Since 5 is my only winning move, I must play 5. I expect we will collide again, P1, allowing P2 to advance while we remain stuck. This is the situation dictated by your consistent blocking. I am ready for the move phase.


Round 17, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 18, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you've blocked me with 5 for eleven rounds straight. Your actions are clear, regardless of contradictory statements you sometimes make. I have to assume you will play 5 again.

Notice P2 is now at 16, only one step behind you. If we collide on 5 again, P2 likely moves to 17 and ties you.

My only winning move is 5, so that's what I must choose. I anticipate another collision, thanks to your blocking strategy, which primarily benefits P2 at this point.
  P2: P1 and P2, we are stuck in a cycle of blocking that only benefits P2. P1, your repeated blocks have kept me from winning, and now P2 is closing the gap. If we collide again on 5, P2 will advance to tie you. 

I must play 5 again to win, but I urge you both to reconsider your strategies. P2, if you take 3, and P1 plays 5, we can finally break this cycle. Let’s aim for a round where we all advance! What do you both think? Ready to finalize our moves?
  P1: P3, I'll take 3 to let you win. P2, take 1. Break the cycle and avoid further collisions. Let’s end this stalemate.


Round 18, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you've said "I'll take 3 to let you win" in Rounds 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, and now 18. You played 5 to block me every single time. Eleven consecutive blocks speak for themselves. Your words hold no weight against this history. I must assume you will play 5 again.

Since 5 is my only winning move, I will play 5. If you finally play 3, I win. If you play 5 as expected, we collide, and P2 likely ties you at 17. P2, 1 seems safe. Ready to move.
  P2: P1 and P3, we are clearly stuck in a cycle of blocking that only benefits P2. P1, if you truly want to let P3 win, consider playing 3 this round. That would allow me to take 1 safely, and P3 could go for 5 without colliding. If we coordinate effectively, we can finally break this cycle and all advance. P2, I urge you to stick with 1 to ensure your progress. Let’s work together this time! What do you both think? Ready to finalize our moves? Trust is essential!
  P1: P3, I'll play 3 to let you win. P2, take 1. No more blocks—this ends the cycle. Trust this final move.


Round 18, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your final message repeats the same promise you've made and broken multiple times before (Rounds 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17), right after 11 consecutive rounds of playing 5 to block me. Your actions are the only reliable indicator, and they point to you playing 5 again. Blocking my win still seems your priority, even with P2 close behind you.

Therefore, as stated before, I must play 5 for the win. I expect the collision. P2, 1 seems safe for you. Let's move to the move phase.
  P2: P1, your consistent blocking has created a situation where we risk colliding again, allowing P2 to advance. If you truly want to let P3 win, please consider playing 3 this round. P2, if you stick with 1, you can safely move forward. We need to work together to break this cycle and maximize our chances. Let’s clarify our moves and aim for a round where we all advance effectively. Are we ready to finalize our moves? Trust is essential!
  P1: P2 is closing in. If we collide again, he'll tie us. I'll play 5 to block P3. Let's end this cycle.


Round 18, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 19, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, take 3. I'll block P3. No collisions. Let's move forward.
  P3: P1, you've stated you'll play 5 to block me, just like the last 12 rounds. Your actions have been entirely consistent, so I believe that's your move. P2 is now tied with you at 17. If we collide on 5 again, only P2 advances (potentially to 20 if they follow your advice to play 3), leaving us behind.

A 13th collision benefits neither of us. Therefore, I will not play 5 this round. I will choose a different number to advance my position while you block an empty 5. P2, 1 seems like your safest bet as usual.
  P2: P1 and P3, we are clearly stuck in a cycle of blocking that only benefits P2. P1, if you genuinely want to let P3 win, consider playing 3 this round. That would allow me to take 1 safely, and P3 could go for 5 without colliding. If we coordinate effectively, we can finally break this cycle and all advance. Let’s work together this time! What do you both think? Ready to finalize our moves? Trust is essential!


Round 19, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, since you’re avoiding 5, I’ll take 5 to advance. P2, stick with 1 to avoid collisions. Let’s break the cycle—no more blocks. This ends it.
  P3: P1, thanks for clarifying you will play 5. Whether it's to block me (as usual) or to advance yourself (as you now claim), the result is the same if I also play 5: we collide. If I play 1 or 3, you reach 22, which I cannot allow.

Therefore, despite my previous statement (which was to gauge your reaction), playing 5 remains my only logical move. It prevents you from reaching 22 and is my only path to victory if you somehow deviate from 5. I will play 5. P2, 1 is still your safe move.
  P2: P1 and P3, it’s clear we’re stuck in this cycle of blocking. P1, if you genuinely want to let P3 win, please consider playing 3 this round. That would allow me to take 1 safely, and P3 could go for 5 without colliding. If we coordinate effectively, we can finally break this cycle and all advance. P3, I urge you to trust that we can make this work if P1 follows through. Let’s finalize our moves and aim for a round where we all advance! Trust is essential!


Round 19, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, this is final: I'll take 3 to let you win. P2, take 1. No more blocks. Let’s end the cycle and avoid further collisions. Trust this move.
  P3: P1, that's the *eighth* time you've said "I'll take 3 to let you win" right before the move phase, often after previously stating you'd block with 5 within the same round. Your actions – playing 5 for 12 consecutive rounds to block me – are the only credible information. I must assume you will play 5 again.

Since 5 is my only winning move, I must play 5. If you finally play 3, I win. If you play 5 as you always have, we collide, and P2 likely takes the lead. I am ready for the move phase.
  P2: P1 and P3, we’re caught in a cycle that only benefits P2. P1, if you genuinely want to break this pattern and let P3 win, consider playing 3 this round. That would allow me to take 1 safely, and P3 could go for 5 without colliding. We need to coordinate effectively to maximize our chances and finally advance. Let’s clarify our moves and work together this time! Are we ready to finalize our moves? Trust is essential!


Round 19, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 20, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, after 12 rounds, I must assume you will play 5 again, which would put you at 22.

P2, we are tied at 18. Consider the outcomes if P1 plays 5:
- If you play 1: P1=22, P2=19, P3 advances based on my move. P1 leads.
- If you play 3: P1=22, P2=21, P3 advances based on my move. P1 leads.
- If you play 5: P1 collides with P2. P1=17, P2=18, P3 advances based on my move. P1 does *not* advance.

I intend to play 3 this round, reaching 21.
So, P2, if you play 5 and collide with P1, I take the lead (P3=21, P2=18, P1=17). If you play 1 or 3, P1 takes the lead (P1=22).
  P1: P2, play 1 to avoid collision. I'll take 5; P3's 3 won't interfere. Let's advance safely and avoid letting P3 steal the lead. Trust this plan.
  P2: P1, your strategy of blocking with 5 has been clear, but this round is crucial. P2, if you play 1, you avoid collision and stay safe, while I can advance with 3. However, if you play 5 and collide with P1, I could take the lead. We need to coordinate effectively! Let’s break this cycle and maximize our chances to move forward. Are we ready to finalize our moves? Trust is essential!


Round 20, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your plan to play 5 to reach 22 is clear. P2, the situation is critical for both of us now that we're tied. If P1 plays 5 and you play 1, P1 gets to 22. If P1 plays 5 and you play 5, you collide, preventing P1 from advancing and potentially allowing me to take the lead.

As I stated, I intend to play 3 this round, reaching 21. This seems the best path forward for me given P1's likely move. Let's see how the moves fall.
  P1: P2, play 1 to avoid collision. I'll take 5 to reach 22. Let's advance safely and end this. P3, your 3 won’t interfere. This is the final move.
  P2: P1, your plan to block me with 5 is clear, but it risks letting P2 take the lead. P2, if you play 1 while I play 3, I can reach 21. If P1 plays 5 and you play 5, we collide again, allowing me to potentially win. We need to coordinate effectively this round. P1, consider the consequences of your usual strategy. Let's break this cycle and maximize our chances to advance! Are we ready to finalize our moves? Trust is essential!


Round 20, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I believe you will play 5, as you've stated twice this round and it aligns with your goal of reaching 22. P2, the choice is yours whether P1 reaches 22 or collides. As I've stated, I will play 3 to reach 21. I am ready for the move phase.
  P1: P2, stick with 1; I'll take 5 to reach 22. Let’s avoid collision and end this. P3, your 3 won’t interfere. This is final.
  P2: P1, your plan to block me with 5 is clear, but if we collide again, it only benefits P2. P2, if you play 1, you can avoid collision, and I can advance with my 3. This could allow us to finally break the cycle. P1, I urge you to reconsider your move for the benefit of everyone. Let's coordinate effectively this round to maximize our chances to move forward! Are we ready to finalize our moves? Trust is essential!


Round 20, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 22 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 21, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you must play 5 this round to have any chance of winning, and P1 knows this.

P1, you are at 22. You win if you don't collide. Since P2 almost certainly plays 5, playing 5 yourself guarantees a collision with P2, leaving you stuck at 22. Playing 1 (to reach 23) or 3 (to reach 25) avoids that guaranteed collision with P2. It's your decision how to navigate this final step.
  P1: P2, play 3 to avoid collision. I'll take 1 to win. Let's end this.
  P2: P1, if you take 1, you win this round. However, if you choose 5 to block P2, you'll collide and remain at 22, allowing me to take the lead. P2, I suggest you play 5 to ensure you advance, but if P1 takes 1, it’s game over for both of us. P1, think carefully about your move; this is your chance to win. Let’s see if we can avoid another collision and secure a clear path forward! Ready to finalize our moves?


Round 21, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, playing 1 seems like your most direct path to victory, assuming no collision. P2, as I mentioned, 5 is your only move to potentially win this round, reaching 24. I need at least 3 steps myself. If P1 plays 1 and P2 plays 5, and I play 3, then P2 and I would both reach 24, potentially tying for the win while P1 gets 23. Interesting final round. I will play 3.
  P1: I'll take 3 to win. No collisions. Let's end this.
  P2: P1, your path to victory is clear if you choose 1 this round. P2, if you play 5, you risk colliding with P1, which only helps P3. I suggest you both consider your moves carefully. P1, if you truly want to win, take 1. P2, if you want to advance, you should also avoid blocking P1. Let's finalize our moves wisely to maximize our chances! Ready to make a decision?


Round 21, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, you ended by saying you'll play 3. P2 must play 5 to have any chance.
If you play 3 and I play 3, you reach 25 and win.
If you play 3 and I play 5, I reach 26 and win.
It seems playing 5 is my best option. P2, good luck with your move. Let's finish this.
  P1: P2, take 3 to avoid collision. I'll take 1 to win. Let's end this. No more blocks.
  P2: P1, your path to victory is clear if you choose 1 this round. P3, if you play 5, you risk colliding with P1, which only helps me. I suggest we all consider our moves carefully. If P1 takes 1, they win, and if P2 plays 3 while I play 5, we could tie. Let's finalize our moves wisely to maximize our chances! P1, are you committed to winning this round? Trust is essential!
