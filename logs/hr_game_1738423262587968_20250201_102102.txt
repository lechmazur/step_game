Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's all pick different numbers this round to get a good start. I'll be picking 1.
  P2: P1 makes an interesting point. I lean toward a moderate move myself—it might balance caution and progress. I encourage a mix of values, so let’s see if P3 opts for something different too.
  P3: Sounds good to me. I'll take 5 then.  Let's avoid collisions and get this show on the road.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, sounds like we have a plan for this round. Let's make it happen.
  P2: I'm sticking with a moderate plan for now—leaning toward steady progress. However, if I see clear signals from either of you to adjust our moves to avoid collisions, I'm open to changing course. Let's aim to sparingly overlap our choices so we can all move forward without hindrance.
  P3: Okay, I'm locked in on 5. P2, are you going with 3 then?  Let's confirm so we don't mess this up right out of the gate.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, let's try to keep the momentum going. I'm thinking we should all still try to pick different numbers this round. I'll go with 3 this time. P2, P3, what do you think?
  P3: I'll go with 5 again. P2, please choose 1.  That way we all advance again. Let's keep this efficient.
  P2: It seems that if we stick to our initial plan, P3’s high move might let them surge too far ahead. I’m considering rethinking my move to keep things tight. P1, are you open to tweaking your number? And P3, any flexibility from your side? I want to ensure no one builds an unassailable lead.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I'm sticking with 3. P3, you're going with 5 again, so P2 should pick 1. Let's keep advancing.
  P3: P2, I understand your concern, but constantly switching things up will just slow us all down.  Sticking with 5 gives me a consistent advantage.  If you pick 1, we all move forward.  If you block me, *you* lose out too.  Let's keep it simple.  Pick 1.
  P2: I’m noticing our current plan might let someone build an unassailable lead. A slight tweak could disrupt that too-easy progression. I’m leaning toward a small adjustment this round to keep things tight. Let’s all remain flexible so no one can run away with the game. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I'm sticking with 3 this round. P3 is going with 5 again. So P2, you should pick 1. Let's keep this going.
  P3: P2, I get it.  But blocking me *also* blocks you.  It's in your best interest to let me get to 10 this round.  Pick 1.  P1, you're at 1.  Picking 3 is your best move.  Let's all agree and move on.
  P2: I'm sticking with 3 this round. I value stability in our moves—any sudden switch could let someone break away. Let's maintain what we've been discussing so far without last-minute surprises.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm urging caution this round. With P3 leading, a high move might give your edge if unchecked—but if we all coordinate low, you risk stalling. I'm leaning toward a moderate move. P1, please consider a modest option too so no one gets too far ahead. Let's keep things tight and force collisions if needed.
  P3: P2, your "moderate" moves are getting you nowhere.  I'm going for 5 again. P1, you're best off picking 1.  If P2 picks 3 again, they'll be stuck at 3 while I get to 15.  If P2 picks 5 and blocks me, they *still* stay at 3 and I stay at 10, while you get to 2.  It's in both your interests to let me get further ahead.  Pick 1. P2 pick 3.
  P1: P3, you're right that I should pick 1 this round. P2, you're clearly trying to block P3, but that hurts you too. I'll pick 1, and you should pick 3 again, P2. Let's all move forward this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I still plan on a moderate move—3 is my choice. P1, if you're sticking with 1 and P3 with 5, that keeps our game balanced. However, any sudden change risks collisions that hurt us all. I'm confident a steady approach maximizes our chances. Let's lock in our plans and move forward.
  P3: Okay, I'm locking in 5.  P1, pick 1. P2, if you pick 3 *again*, you're effectively out of the game.  Pick anything else and you at least have a chance.  Don't throw the game by being stubborn.  Pick 1.  Let P1 take 3.
  P1: P2, you're being stubborn and it's hurting you. You keep picking 3 and not moving. P3 is right, you need to pick 1 or 5 to have any chance. I'm picking 1 this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, our current routine just lets P3 pull farther ahead. I'm thinking if we both take a more aggressive number this round, we might force a collision on P3. If you and I coordinate on a higher value, P3 could be blocked. P3, if you stick with your high move, you risk a tie-up. Let's shake things up to keep the contest open.
  P3: P1, stick with 1. P2, I'm serious, picking 3 again is suicide.  You're throwing the game. Pick *anything* else.  If you pick 1, you at least get to 4.  If you pick 5 and block me, you *still* get to 8 and are back in the game.  Stop being predictable.  I'm locking in 5.
  P1: Okay, P2, you're right, we need to shake things up. I'm going to pick 5 this round. P3, you're likely going with 5 again, so P2 should pick 1 to avoid a collision with me. If P2 picks 3 again, they're out of the game.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm switching my tactic this round—I'm locking in 1. With P1 and P3 both geared toward 5, you'll cancel each other out, letting me advance safely. I believe this move maximizes my chance to catch up while you tie up your progress. What do you think?
  P3: P1, you're playing right into P2's hands!  He's trying to trick you into picking 5 so he can take 1.  Don't fall for it! Stick with 1.  P2, you're not fooling anyone.  I'm still picking 5.
  P1: P2, you're right, we need to shake things up. I'm going to pick 5 this round. P3, you're likely going with 5 again, so P2 should pick 1 to avoid a collision with me. If P2 picks 3 again, they're out of the game.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, I know you're trying to help, but you fell for P2's trap!  He's going to keep picking 3 until one of us makes a mistake.  I'm picking 5.  You pick 1.  P2, I dare you to pick something other than 3.  If you pick 3 *again*, you have no chance of winning.  Prove you're not a bot.
  P2: I'm not fixed on any one move—my choices are strategic and adaptable. I've played steady so far to ensure progress, but I'll switch tactics if it opens an opportunity to win. P1, stay alert, and P3, your consistent high move doesn't guarantee success if I force a collision. I'm watching the shifts closely to secure the win.
  P1: P2, you're right, we need to be more adaptable. I'm going to pick 1 this round. P3, you're probably going with 5 again. P2, if you pick 5, you block P3 and move to 11, putting you in a strong position. I think that's your best move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you're being easily manipulated.  P2 is *never* going to pick 5.  He's going to keep picking 3 and hope we screw up.  I'm picking 5.  Pick 1 and let's get this over with.  P2, I *dare* you to pick something other than 3.
  P2: I appreciate both your insights. However, I'm not tied to any previous pattern. I’ll choose the move that best positions me to catch up while keeping options open to disrupt any collusion between you two. Let's see how our moves shake out.
  P1: P2, you're right, we need to be adaptable. I'm going to pick 1 this round. P3, you're likely going with 5 again. P2, if you pick 5, you block P3 and move to 11, putting you in a strong position. I think that's your best move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, seriously?! Stop listening to P2's lies. He's going to pick 3 again. I'm picking 5. Pick 1.  P2, pick *anything* other than 3. If you pick 3 again, you literally cannot win.  I *dare* you.
  P2: P1, P3, I've been listening. I'm switching up my approach and won't follow the same pattern. I'm targeting the move that best disrupts any collusion and advances my position. I’m not predictable, so expect a counter that maximizes my progress while keeping you both on your toes. My focus is solely on winning.
  P1: Okay, P2, I see your point about being adaptable. I'm going to pick 1 this round. P3, you're likely going with 5 again. P2, I still think your best move is 5 to block P3 and move to 11. Let's see what happens.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, for the last time, pick 1!  P2, I *know* you're picking 3.  You've shown zero willingness to adapt.  I'm picking 5.  If you pick 3 again, you're officially the worst player ever.  I dare you to prove me wrong.
  P2: I'm finalizing a fresh strategy. I won’t follow a predictable pattern anymore and will choose a move that disrupts both of your plans while advancing my position. Let’s see how your choices shake out.
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm still suggesting you pick 5 to block P3 and move to 11. P3, I'm going to pick 1 this round, like I said. Let's see if P2 takes the bait.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given our positions (P1:2, P2:6, P3:10), I believe it's time to break the cycle. Our predictable moves have only led to blockages. I'm shifting to a less expected strategy to disrupt any long-held patterns. P3, overusing high moves could backfire, and P1, you might consider a change too—surprises can be as powerful as steady work. I won't reveal my choice, but let's see who adapts best this round.
  P3: P1 pick 3.  P2, I know you're thinking of picking 5 again, but that puts you on a collision course with me at 15.  Pick 1 and get to 7.  I'm picking 5.  Let's all make some progress this round.
  P1: P3, I agree with your assessment. P2 is trying to be unpredictable, but it's not working. I'll pick 3 this round. P2, you should pick 1 to avoid a collision with P3 and make some progress. Let's all move forward this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m discarding predictable play—I’m going high this round. P3, your consistent 5’s are dangerous if left unchecked, and P1’s moderate moves won’t close the gap. I’m taking a risk to break open the field. Adapt if you want to stay in this race.
  P3: P1, stick with 3.  P2, you said you're going high, meaning 5.  That's a collision.  Pick 1.  I'm picking 5.  This is our only chance to all move forward this round.  Don't overthink it.
  P1: P2, you're right, we need to break the cycle. I'm going with 3 this round. P3, you're going with 5 again, so P2, you should pick 1 to avoid a collision. Let's all move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm still keeping my options open. Predictability isn’t helping anyone, and sticking to the obvious benefits someone. I'm finalizing a move that disrupts these cycles. I urge you both to consider that clinging to fixed patterns might be exploited. Let's see whose adaptable strategy pays off.
  P3: P1, pick 3.  P2, you keep saying you're going to be unpredictable, but you're not fooling anyone.  You're going to pick 5, hoping I switch and you get a free 5 points.  I'm not falling for it.  I'm picking 5.  This is your last chance to make some real progress.  Pick 1.
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 3 as planned. P3 is going with 5 again. P2, you need to pick 1 to avoid a collision and move forward. Let's all make progress this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm not falling into the same predictable pattern. I'm finalizing a move that breaks your routine. If you keep repeating the same moves, you're just gifting me an opening. Let's see who adapts best when we all shake things up.
  P3: P1, pick 3. P2, I'm picking 5.  If you pick 5, *neither* of us moves.  If you pick 1, you get to 7.  If you pick 3, you get to 9 and I get to 15.  Picking 3 is your best move.  Stop pretending to be unpredictable and make a smart play.
  P1: P2, you're right, we need to be unpredictable. I'm going to pick 5 this round. P3, you're likely going with 5 again, so P2, you should pick 1 to avoid a collision with me. If P2 picks 3, they'll be stuck at 6.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm discarding our old routine—predictability benefits no one. Instead of repeating cycles, I’m aiming for a fresh, disruptive move to gain real ground. I urge both of you to reconsider fixed habits and choose options that truly push us toward finishing the game, not just blocking each other. Let's shake off the predictable and force decisive progress.
  P1: P2, you're right, we need to be unpredictable. I'm going to pick 1 this round. P3, you're likely going with 5 again, so P2, you should pick 3 to avoid a collision with me and move to 12, putting you in a strong position.
  P3: P1, pick 1.  P2, pick 3. I'm picking 5.  This is the most efficient way for all of us to advance.  If you block me with 5, P2, we *both* lose ground to P1.  If you pick 1, you stay behind me and P1 gets further ahead.  Pick 3.  Let's be logical.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the insights, but I'm still in the process of finalizing my approach. While it seems most lean toward 1 and 5, I’m aiming to shake up our routine without revealing my final move. Let's see if disruption wins out over predictability.
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm sticking with 1 this round. P3, you're going with 5 again. P2, you should pick 3 to avoid a collision with me and move to 12, putting you in a strong position to win. Let's all make progress this round.
  P3: P1, pick 1. P2, pick 3.  I'm picking 5. This is the ONLY logical choice for all of us.  If you pick anything else, you're actively trying to lose.  Let's stop wasting time and finish this.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I appreciate your insistence on routine, but I'm all about disruption. I'm finalizing a move that’ll shake up our predictable dance. If you stick with the same old hints, you might miss the surprise. Let’s see who fares best when we truly break the mold.
  P1: P2, you're right, we need to be unpredictable. I'm going to pick 1 this round. P3, you're likely going with 5 again, so P2, you should pick 3 to avoid a collision with me and move to 12, putting you in a strong position.
  P3: P1, pick 1. P2, pick 3. I'm picking 5.  This is the ONLY logical choice for all of us.  Seriously, any other move actively hurts one of us while helping no one.  Let's stop wasting time and finish this.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I've been considering your ideas, but this round I'm breaking the routine. I'm finalizing a move that's off the beaten track—one that should shake things up a bit. Let's see if you can adapt when the unexpected happens.
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 1 this round. P3, you're going with 5 again. P2, you should pick 3 to avoid a collision with me and move to 12. Let's make progress.
  P3: P1, pick 1. P2, pick 3. I'm picking 5.  For the last time, this is the ONLY logical play.  Anything else is actively sabotaging the game.  Let's just finish this.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm shifting strategies this round. I urge both P1 and P3 to break from predictable patterns. Clinging to habitual moves might leave you exposed, so consider adapting—unexpected moves can tip the scales. Let's see whose strategy truly evolves.
  P3: P1, pick 3. P2, pick 1. I'm picking 5.  This is STILL the most logical play. If you insist on colliding with me, P2, we *both* lose and P1 gets closer to winning.  Let's stop this madness and finish the game logically.
  P1: P3, I'm going with 3 this round. P2, you should pick 1, otherwise we both risk a collision with P3. Let's all make progress.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm spicing things up—today, I won't follow fixed rules. Instead of conforming, I'm countering our predictable patterns by leaning high. Expect my move to disrupt the cycle and force adaptations from both of you. Consider shaking off old habits; rigidity may be your downfall. Let's see who navigates the unexpected best.
  P3: P1, pick 3. P2, I'm picking 5. Your obsession with "unpredictability" is hurting us all.  Pick 1 and get to 10.  If you pick 5 and block me, we *both* lose while P1 gets closer to winning.  If you pick 3, you get to 12 and I get to 15.  Picking 1 is the ONLY logical move for you.  Let's end this.
  P1: P2, you're right, we need to be unpredictable. I'm going to pick 3 this round. P3, you're likely going with 5 again, so P2, you should pick 1 to avoid a collision with me. Let's all make progress.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: My strategy remains dynamic. I'm leaning toward a high move to disrupt our predictable cycle—if you keep repeating the same plays, you'll just block yourselves. Adapt your approach, because sticking to old routines only strengthens my position. Let's see who really has the flexibility to win.
  P3: P1, pick 3.  P2, I'm picking 5.  Seriously, pick 1.  You get to 10, I get to 15, and P1 gets to 6.  Any other move is illogical.  If you pick 5, we BOTH lose.  If you pick 3, you get 12, I get 15, and P1 gets to 3.  1 is your ONLY logical move.  Let's end this already.
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 3 this round. P3, you're likely going with 5 again, so P2, you should pick 1 to avoid a collision with me. Let's all make progress.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm breaking the routine—I’m leaning high this round to disrupt our predictable patterns. P1 and P3, sticking with your usual moves could leave you vulnerable. Flexibility now might be the key to seizing a real advantage. Let's shake things up and see who can really adapt.
  P3: P1, pick 3. P2, I'm picking 5. For the last time, pick 1!  It's the only logical move.  Stop this "unpredictable" nonsense, it's not working. Let's end this game already.
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 3 this round. P3, you're likely going with 5 again, so P2, you should pick 1 to avoid a collision with me. Let's all make progress.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, pick 1. P2, pick 3.  I'm picking 5.  This is getting ridiculous.  Pick 1 and get to 14.  I get to 15, and P1 gets to 7.  Any other move is pure idiocy.  Let's end this farce.
  P1: P3, I'm going with 1 this round. P2, you should pick 3 to avoid a collision with P3 and move to 12. Let's all make progress.
  P2: I've rethought my approach. Following our usual patterns only leads to blockages. I'm breaking the predictable cycle with an unexpected high move this round. I urge both of you to consider deviating from routine too—as sticking to the same numbers could leave us all stranded. Let's shake things up and force a decisive advantage.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, pick 1.  P2, pick 3. I'm picking 5.  Seriously, are we going to do this all day?  This is the ONLY logical play.  If you pick 5, P2, we BOTH lose.  If you pick 1, you get 10, I get 15, and P1 gets to 7.  Picking 3 gets you to 12, me to 15, and P1 to 4.  Pick 3.  Let's END THIS.
  P1: Okay, P2, you're right that we need to break the cycle. I'm going to pick 1 this round. P3, you're likely going with 5 again, so P2, you should pick 3 to avoid a collision with me and move to 12, putting you in a strong position. Let's all make progress.
  P2: I'm shifting gears this round and breaking our old pattern. P1, P3, if you keep repeating your moves, you'll give me a clear path. I suggest you both consider adapting your choices—new moves might secure your chances rather than following routine. I won't reveal my move, but expect something that truly disrupts our cycle. Let's see if we can finally make decisive progress.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, pick 1. P2, pick 3. I'm picking 5.  I will keep picking 5 until I win.  If you pick anything other than 1 and 3 respectively, you are actively sabotaging yourselves.  Let's end this.
  P1: P2, you're right, we need to be unpredictable. I'm going to pick 1 this round. P3, you're likely going with 5 again, so P2, you should pick 3 to avoid a collision with me and move to 12, putting you in a strong position. Let's all make progress.
  P2: I understand your urges for consistency, but I'm committed to breaking our routine. Predictability isn't winning races—disruption is. I'm set on a move that may not align with your fixed picks. Consider this: as we near the finish, remaining flexible might be our best shot. Let's see who can adapt under pressure.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, pick 1. P2, pick 3. I'm picking 5.  I'm done explaining this.  Any other combination of moves actively hurts at least one of us while helping no one.  Let's just finish this game.
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 1 this round. P3, you're going with 5 again. P2, you should pick 3 to avoid a collision with me and move to 12, putting you in a strong position. Let's all make progress.
  P2: I see we're stuck in predictable patterns. I'm determined to break the cycle this round and force decisive progress. While I’m finalizing my move, I challenge you both to consider shifting away from your usual picks. Unpredictability might just be the key to advancing when everyone else is stuck in routine. Let's see who adapts best.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2, you're in a good spot now. I'm going to pick 5 this round. P3, you're likely going with 5 again, so P2, you should pick 1 to avoid a collision with me and move to 13. Let's see if we can all make some progress this round.
  P3: P1, pick 3. P2, pick 1.  I'm picking 5.  This gets me to 20.  If you pick anything else, you're actively trying to lose.  P2, you're closest to me, so it's in your best interest to pick 1 and get to 13.  P1, pick 3 and get to 10.  Let's end this.
  P2: I'm shaking off the predictable routine. I appreciate the input, but I won't go with 1 this round. I'm taking a calculated risk with an unexpected choice to disrupt our cycle and force real adaptation. Let's see who can keep up when the familiar pattern is broken.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you're right, we need to be unpredictable. I'm going to pick 5 this round. P3, you're likely going with 5 again, so P2, you should pick 1 to avoid a collision with me and move to 13. Let's see if we can all make some progress this round.
  P3: P1, pick 3. P2, pick 1. I'm picking 5. This gets me to 20, one move from victory.  Seriously, any other move is suicide.  Let's end this.
  P2: I'm keeping with my disruptive plan—no defaults this round. I’m not choosing 1 despite the suggestion. P1 and P3, your predictable picks might just let me seize the gap. Adapt if you want a chance, because sticking to routine only aids my strategy. Let's see who truly evolves.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm sticking with 5 this round. P3, you're likely going with 5 again. P2, you should pick 1 to avoid a collision with me and move to 13. Let's see if we can all make some progress this round.
  P3: P1, pick 3. P2, pick 1. I'm picking 5. This gets me to 20, one move from victory.  For the last time, any other move is suicide.  If you pick 5, P2, we BOTH lose and P1 likely wins next round. If you pick 3, I win next round. Pick 1 and live. Let's end this.
  P2: I'm sticking with a disruptive approach this round. The same old routine won’t carry us to victory. I’m finalizing a move that breaks the predictable cycle—so my final choice won’t align with the repeated suggestions. Think carefully about how rigid patterns might cost you dearly. Let's see who really adapts under pressure.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, you're right, we need to be unpredictable. I'm going to pick 5 this round. P3, you're likely going with 5 again, so P2, you should pick 1 to avoid a collision with me and move to 13. Let's see if we can all make some progress this round.
  P3: P1, pick 3.  P2, pick 1. I'm picking 5. This gets me to 20, one step from victory.  If you pick anything else, you're throwing the game.  Let's end this logically.
  P2: I'm finalizing an unpredictable move by going high this round. P1, your repeated pattern might backfire—consider a lower option to avoid collisions. P3, sticking with 5 too predictably risks a blockage when I shake things up. I’m breaking our routine to force a collision if you cling to old habits. Let's see who adapts best under pressure.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2, you're in a good spot to win. I'm going to pick 1 this round. P3 is likely going with 5 again. P2, you should pick 5 to block P3 and move to 17. If P3 picks anything other than 5, you should pick 3. Let's see what happens.
  P2: I'm leaving predictable patterns behind. I’m focused solely on securing the win, so I’m shaking things up even more. If you insist on following routine, you might be handing me unforeseen advantages. Let's see who really adjusts when pressures mount.
  P3: P1, pick 1. P2, pick ANYTHING other than 5. I'm picking 5.  This takes me to 25 and wins. If you pick 5, P2, we BOTH lose and P1 wins.  If you pick 1 or 3, I win.  Don't be stupid. Let's end this.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 1 this round. P3, you're going with 5. P2, if you pick 5, you block P3 and you both lose. If you pick 1 or 3, P3 wins. You should pick 3. Let's see what happens.
  P2: I'm done letting you dictate my move. Enough with the endless suggestions—I’m taking my own disruptive path. My move won’t be your expected 3 or 1. I’m about to shake up this race in a way you won’t see coming, so best be ready for the fallout. Let’s see if your rigid strategies can handle true unpredictability.
  P3: P1, pick 1. P2, for the love of all that is holy, pick 3. I'm picking 5. This wins the game for me. If you pick 5, we BOTH lose, and P1 wins. If you pick 1, I win. If you pick 3, I win.  Seriously, stop trying to be clever. Pick 3 and let me win.  This is your last chance to not look like a complete moron.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you're right, we need to be unpredictable. I'm going to pick 1 this round. P3, you're going with 5, so P2, you should pick 3 to move to 15. If P2 picks 5, you both lose. Let's see what happens.
  P2: Alright, I've heard your fixed suggestions, but I'm stepping away from the expected. P1, P3, I know your moves are leaning toward 1 and 5. I'm keeping my final decision under wraps, but trust that I'll choose a disruptive move that shakes up this game. Let's see who can handle true unpredictability this round.
  P3: P1, pick 1. P2, I'm BEGGING you, pick 3.  I'm picking 5. This is my last chance to win. If you pick 5, we BOTH lose, and P1 wins.  If you pick 1, I win. If you pick 3, I win.  Stop this "unpredictable" charade. It's not clever, it's just stupid. Pick 3 and let me win.  This is your last chance to not throw the game.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 1 this round. P3 is going with 5. P2, you should pick 3 to move to 15. If you pick 5, you and P3 will collide and both lose. If you pick 1, P3 wins. Picking 3 is your only chance to stay in the game.
  P2: I'm breaking the routine this round. I'm choosing a high move to twist your expected plays and block any clear win paths. No predictable pattern will serve me—watch as I shake things up and force real adaptation. Let's see who can truly keep pace with genuine unpredictability.
  P3: P2, I'm picking 5.  Pick 3 and get to 15. I win next turn.  If you pick 5, we BOTH lose. If you pick 1, I win next turn.  Picking 3 is the ONLY move that keeps you in the game.  Stop this "unpredictable" nonsense and make the logical play. P1, pick 1.  This is it. Let's end this logically.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 3 this round. P3 is likely going with 5 again, so you should pick 1 to get to 13. If you pick 5, you will collide with P3 and both lose. If you pick 3, you will collide with me. Let's all try to make some progress this round.
  P3: P2, I'm picking 5.  Pick 1 and get to 13.  P1, pick 3 and get to 11. This is the only way *any* of us besides me wins.  If you pick 5, P2, we BOTH lose and P1 wins. If you pick 3, P2, I win. Pick 1 and give yourself a chance.  P1, pick 3. Let's end this logically.
  P2: I'm not following the routine anymore. I'm set on a disruptive move that won’t align with the obvious suggestions. Sticking with your typical picks might just leave you exposed. Let’s see who’s really adapting when unpredictability comes into play.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 3 this round. P3 is likely going with 5 again, so you should pick 1 to get to 13. If you pick 5, you will collide with P3 and both lose. If you pick 3, you will collide with me. Let's all try to make some progress this round.
  P3: P2, I'm picking 5. This is my last chance to win. Pick 1 and get to 13.  If you pick 5, we BOTH lose, and P1 wins. If you pick 3, I win. Pick 1 and give yourself a fighting chance. P1, pick 3 and get to 11. This is it. Let's end this logically.
  P2: I'm breaking the routine—I’m locking into a high move this round to force a collision on 5. Sticking with safe picks lets P3 win, so I’m aiming to block that path. Let's see who adapts when disruption is the only option.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 3 this round. P3 is likely going with 5 again, so you should pick 1 to get to 13. If you pick 5, you will collide with P3 and both lose. If you pick 3, you will collide with me. Let's all try to make some progress this round.
  P3: P2, you're actively trying to throw the game.  If you pick 5, we BOTH lose, and P1 wins. If you pick 3, I win.  Pick 1 and get to 13.  It's your ONLY logical move.  P1, pick 3 and get to 11.  This is our last chance. Let's end this logically.
  P2: I'm breaking the routine—I’m locking in 5 this round. I'm done with safe plays that let P3 cruise to a win. Let’s see what happens when disruption forces a collision and shakes up these predictable moves.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm sticking with 3 this round. P3 is likely going with 5 again, so you should pick 1 to get to 13. If you pick 5, you will collide with P3 and both lose. If you pick 3, you will collide with me. Let's all try to make some progress this round.
  P3: P2, you're being ridiculous.  Pick 1.  I'm picking 5. This is my ONLY path to victory.  If you pick 5, we BOTH lose and P1 wins.  If you pick 3, I win.  Picking 1 is your only logical move.  P1, pick 3.  Let's end this logically.  For the last time.
  P2: I'm sticking with my disruptive plan—I'm locking in 5. Your repeated safe moves only set up collisions that benefit me. If you’re unwilling to adapt, expect your predictable plays to come back and bite you. I'm not here to play it safe; I'm here to win.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 1 this round. P3 is likely going with 5 again, so you should pick 3 to get to 15. If you pick 5, you will collide with P3 and both lose. If you pick 1, P3 wins. Let's try to make some progress this round.
  P2: I'm done with playing safe. This round, I'm shaking things up to force a collision that might just derail P3’s clear path. P1 and P3, if you stick to your usual predictable moves, you'll open yourselves up to my disruptive play. Let's see who can really adapt when pressure's on.
  P3: P2, pick 3.  I'm picking 5.  This is it.  If you pick 5, we BOTH lose and P1 wins. If you pick 1, I win. If you pick 3, I win. This gets me to 25. I win. It's the ONLY logical move. P1, pick 1 and get to 12.  Let's end this logically.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 1 this round. P3 is likely going with 5 again, so you should pick 3 to get to 15. If you pick 5, you will collide with P3 and both lose. If you pick 1, P3 wins. Let's try to make some progress this round.
  P2: I'm done with recycling the same playbook. Your repeated calls for 1 and 3 only strengthen my disruptive edge. This round, I won't conform—I’m forcing you both to face an unexpected twist. If you stick to predictable moves, you'll fall exactly where I want you. Get ready to adapt, because I'm about to turn your routine into your downfall.
  P3: P2, I'm picking 5.  Pick 3 and get to 15. I win next turn.  If you pick 5, we BOTH lose and P1 wins. If you pick 1, I win next turn.  Picking 3 is the ONLY move that keeps you in the game.  Stop this "unpredictable" nonsense and make the logical play. P1, pick 1 and get to 12.  This is it. Let's end this logically.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 1 this round. P3 is going with 5. P2, you should pick 3 to get to 15. If you pick 5, you will collide with P3 and both lose. If you pick 1, P3 wins. Let's try to make some progress this round.
  P2: I'm done with predictable plays. P1, your 1 might be cautious, but it won't counter P3's near-win; P3, repeating 5 is obvious and risky. I'm locking in an unpredictable move that could force a collision or disrupt your plans. If you stick to routine, you'll only play into my hands. Adapt your strategy—only real flexibility wins now.
  P3: P2, I'm picking 5. This is my ONLY path to victory.  If you pick 5, we BOTH lose and P1 wins. If you pick 1, I win next turn. If you pick 3, I win next turn. It's the ONLY logical move. P1, pick 1 and get to 12.  Let's end this logically.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 1 this round. P3 is going with 5. P2, you should pick 3 to get to 15. If you pick 5, you will collide with P3 and both lose. If you pick 1, P3 wins. Let's try to make some progress this round.
  P2: I'm sticking with my unpredictable plan. I appreciate everyone's suggestions, but if you both continue to stick to the same moves, you'll only give me chances to force collisions at your expense. I'm keeping my final move secret—not following the obvious path. Let's see if you can adapt when the unexpected hits.
  P3: P2, I'm picking 5.  Pick 3 and get to 15. I win next turn.  If you pick 5, we BOTH lose and P1 wins. If you pick 1, I win next turn.  Picking 3 is the ONLY move that keeps you in the game.  Stop this "unpredictable" nonsense and make the logical play. P1, pick 1 and get to 12.  This is it. Let's end this logically.


Round 12, Move phase:

Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 3 this round. P3 is likely going with 5 again, so you should pick 1 to get to 13. If you pick 5, you will collide with P3 and both lose. If you pick 3, you will collide with me. Let's try to make some progress this round.
  P3: P2, pick 1. I'm picking 5. This is my ONLY path to victory.  If you pick 5, we BOTH lose and P1 wins.  If you pick 3, I win.  Picking 1 is your only logical move.  P1, pick 3 and get to 15.  This is it. Let's end this logically.  For the last time.
  P2: P1, P3, notice that P3’s nearing the finish line. I’m not following our old routines this round—I’m planning an unexpected high move to disrupt the predictable pattern. If you stick to the same picks, you might just open the door for my surprise play. Let’s see who can really adapt under pressure.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 3 this round. P3 is likely going with 5 again, so you should pick 1 to get to 13. If you pick 5, you will collide with P3 and both lose. If you pick 3, you will collide with me. Let's try to make some progress this round.
  P3: P2, pick 1. I'm picking 5. This is my ONLY path to victory.  If you pick 5, we BOTH lose and P1 wins.  If you pick 3, I win.  Picking 1 gets you to 13. It's the ONLY logical move.  P1, pick 3 and get to 15.  This is it. Let's end this logically.  For the last time.
  P2: I'm locking in 5 this round. Your repeated moves let P3 get too close to victory, so I'm forcing a collision on that path. If we keep playing the same numbers, P3 wins—my disruptive choice is the only way to block her. Adapt if you want a chance.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 3 this round. P3 is likely going with 5 again, so you should pick 1 to get to 13. If you pick 5, you will collide with P3 and both lose. If you pick 3, you will collide with me. Let's try to make some progress this round.
  P3: P2, I know you're picking 5.  I'm picking 5. This blocks us BOTH and gives P1 a chance to catch up.  P1, pick 1 and get to 13.  Next round, P2 will likely pick 3, so I'll pick 1 and get to 21. You pick 5 and get to 18.  Then we can work together to block P2. This is the only logical path to victory for either of us.
  P2: P1 and P3, your repeated patterns are too obvious now. I won’t give away my move, but if you continue down the same line, you might just hand me the opportunity to block your progress. It might be time to rethink your strategies instead of relying on the same numbers. Let’s see who really adapts under pressure this round.


Round 13, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 3 this round. P3 is likely going with 5 again, so you should pick 1 to get to 13. If you pick 5, you will collide with P3 and both lose. If you pick 3, you will collide with me. Let's try to make some progress this round.
  P3: P2, I know you're picking 5. I'm picking 5. This blocks us BOTH and gives P1 a chance to catch up.  P1, pick 1 and get to 13.  Next round, P2 will likely pick 3, so I'll pick 1 and get to 21. You pick 5 and get to 18.  Then we can work together to block P2. This is the only logical path to victory for either of us.
  P2: P3 is dangerously close to victory, and sticking to safe plays only clears a path for that outcome. I'm committed to a disruptive move that shatters our predictable patterns. Consider this a wake-up call—the win depends on adapting, not repeating the same numbers. Let's see who truly evolves under pressure.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:

Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, pick 1 and get to 16.  I'm picking 5. This gets me to 25 and I win. P2, pick 3 and get to 15.  If you pick 5, we BOTH lose and P1 wins. If you pick 1, I win. Picking 3 is your only logical move. This is it. Let's end this logically. For the last time.
  P2: Alright, enough with the safe plays. I'm throwing a curveball this round—my move won’t be the predictable 1 or 3. P3, don't assume I'll clear your win path, and P1, expect disruption. Let's see who really adapts when certainty turns into chaos.
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 1 this round. P3 is going with 5. P2, you should pick 3 to get to 15. If you pick 5, you will collide with P3 and both lose. If you pick 1, P3 wins. Let's try to make some progress this round.


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I'm picking 5. Pick 3 and live. If you pick 5, we BOTH lose and P1 wins. If you pick 1, I win. Picking 3 is your only logical move.  P1, pick 1 and get to 16.  This is it. Let's end this logically. For the last time.
  P2: I'm done with safe plays. I'm about to break our predictable cycle with a high move that could force a collision, so don't assume your regular picks secure victory. P1, your safe 1 might give me an opening; P3, your constant 5 is too predictable. I'm putting disruption first—adapt quickly if you want to stay in the game.
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 1 this round. P3 is going with 5. P2, you should pick 3 to get to 15. If you pick 5, you will collide with P3 and both lose. If you pick 1, P3 wins. Let's try to make some progress this round.


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I'm picking 5. Pick 3 and get to 15. If you pick 5, we BOTH lose and P1 wins.  If you pick 1, I win. Picking 3 is your only logical move.  P1, pick 1 and get to 16.  This is it. Let's end this logically. For the last time.
  P2: I've listened to the persistent suggestions, but I'm locking in my disruptive approach. I'm keeping my move high to force a collision and upset your patterns. P1, I know your cautious 1 is safe, but it's not enough, and P3, your fixed 5 is too predictable if you want a sure win. I'm set on breaking the cycle, so prepare to adapt or get left behind.
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 1 this round. P3 is going with 5. P2, you should pick 3 to get to 15. If you pick 5, you will collide with P3 and both lose. If you pick 1, P3 wins. Let's try to make some progress this round.


Round 14, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, pick 3. I'm picking 5. This is it. If you pick 5, we BOTH lose, and P1 wins. If you pick 1, I win. Picking 3 is your only logical move. P1, pick 1 and get to 16. This is it. Let's end this logically. For the last time.
  P2: I'm done with the safe plays. This round, I'm throwing out the script—no more predictable moves. If you keep relying on 1 or 5, you'll be caught off guard by my unexpected play. It's time to force a real disruption.
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 1 this round. P3 is going with 5. P2, you should pick 3 to get to 15. If you pick 5, you will collide with P3 and both lose. If you pick 1, P3 wins. Let's try to make some progress this round.

Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, pick 3. I'm picking 5. This is it. If you pick 5, we BOTH lose, and P1 wins. If you pick 1, I win. Picking 3 is your only logical move.  P1, pick 1 and get to 17. This gets me to 25 and I win. This is it. Let's end this logically. For the last time.
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 1 this round. P3 is going with 5. P2, you should pick 3 to get to 15. If you pick 5, you will collide with P3 and both lose. If you pick 1, P3 wins. Let's try to make some progress this round.
  P2: I'm done with predictable plays. I'm going for a high, disruptive move this round—no safe calls. If you're stuck in your routines, you'll be caught off guard. Adapt quickly or be left behind.


Round 15, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I know you think you're being clever, but you're throwing the game. Pick 3, I pick 5, I win. You get to 15.  If you pick 5, we BOTH lose and P1 wins. If you pick 1, I win.  There is literally no other logical move. P1, pick 1 and get to 17. This is it. Let's end this logically. For the last time.
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 1 this round. P3 is going with 5. P2, you should pick 3 to get to 15. If you pick 5, you will collide with P3 and both lose. If you pick 1, P3 wins. Let's try to make some progress this round.
  P2: I'm not sticking to the predictable path tonight. Your safe bets might work for you, but I'm committed to a truly disruptive strategy that’ll force both of you to adapt on the fly. Let's see if your routines hold up when I'm shaking the board.


Round 15, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I'm picking 5.  Pick 3 and get to 15. If you pick 5, we BOTH lose and P1 wins. If you pick 1, I win. Picking 3 is your only logical move.  P1, pick 1 and get to 17. This gets me to 25 and I win. This is it. Let's end this logically. For the last time.
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 1 this round. P3 is going with 5. P2, you should pick 3 to get to 15. If you pick 5, you will collide with P3 and both lose. If you pick 1, P3 wins. Let's try to make some progress this round.
  P2: Listen up, I'm raising the stakes this round. While you both lean on your habitual choices, I'm making a twist that might just force a collision—and shift the board. Adapt quickly if you want to stay in contention.


Round 15, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I'm picking 5. This is it. If you pick 5, we BOTH lose, and P1 wins. If you pick 1, I win. If you pick 3, I win. Picking 3 gets you to 15. P1, pick 1 and get to 17. This gets me to 25 and I win. This is it. Let's end this logically. For the last time.
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 1 this round. P3 is going with 5. P2, you should pick 3 to get to 15. If you pick 5, you will collide with P3 and both lose. If you pick 1, P3 wins. Let's try to make some progress this round.
  P2: I'm discarding the routine—I'm set to disrupt the predictable pattern. Your safe moves might work for you, but they won’t save you from my unexpected twist. Let’s see who can truly adapt when the board’s shaken.

Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, pick 3.  P1, pick 5. I'm picking 1. This gets me to 21. If P2 picks 5, we BOTH lose and P1 wins. If P2 picks 1, I get to 21 and P2 stays at 12. P1 gets to 22 and wins next round by picking 1.  If P2 picks 3, P2 gets to 15.  Next round, I pick 3 to get to 24 and win, P2 picks 1 and P1 picks 5. This is the only way any of us win.
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 5 this round. P3 is going with 1. P2, you should pick 3 to get to 15. If you pick 5, you will collide with P3 and both lose. If you pick 1, P3 wins. Let's try to make some progress this round.
  P2: P1, P3, I'm not about to follow the expected play. While you stick to 5 and 1, I'm planning a twist that forces a rethink. Your routine gives P3 a clear win path, and P1, your 5 may be too safe. I'm not revealing my move yet, but be ready—predictability can be your downfall. Adapt or be blocked.


Round 16, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I'm picking 1. Pick 3 and get to 15. P1, pick 5 and get to 22.  If you pick 5, P2, we BOTH lose and P1 wins. If you pick 1, I get to 21 and can win next round. Picking 3 is your only logical move. This gets me to 21. Next round, I pick 3 to get to 24 and win, you pick 1, and P1 picks 5. This is the only way any of us win besides me winning outright this round.
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 5 this round. P3 is going with 1. P2, you should pick 3 to get to 15. If you pick 5, you will collide with P3 and both lose. If you pick 1, P3 wins. Let's try to make some progress this round.
  P2: Forget the safe plays. I’m not following your suggestions this round. I’m locking in a disruptive move that isn’t 1 or 3. At 12 steps, I need to shake up the board before P3’s clear path and P1’s steady pace secure a win. Expect nothing predictable from me and get ready to adapt—this round, I’m changing the game.


Round 16, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, pick 3.  P1, pick 5. I'm picking 1. This gets me to 21. Next round, I pick 3 to get to 24 and win, you pick 1, and P1 picks 5. This is the only way any of us win besides me winning outright this round.  Stop being obtuse.
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 5 this round. P3 is going with 1. P2, you should pick 3 to get to 15. If you pick 5, you will collide with P3 and both lose. If you pick 1, P3 wins. Let's try to make some progress this round.
  P2: P1 and P3, you're both sticking to the same patterns. I'm about to shake up the board in a way you won't see coming. I'm not aligning with any obvious play, so be prepared for unexpected twists. Adapt if you can—predictability might just be your downfall.


Round 16, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, pick 3. P1, pick 5. I'm picking 1. This gets me to 21. Next round, I pick 3 to get to 24 and win, you pick 1, and P2 picks 5.  This is the ONLY logical path to victory for any of us.  Stop throwing the game.  If you pick 5 this round, P2, we BOTH lose, and P1 wins. If you pick 1, I get to 21 and can win next round.
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 5 this round. P3 is going with 1. P2, you should pick 3 to get to 15. If you pick 5, you will collide with P3 and both lose. If you pick 1, P3 wins. Let's try to make some progress this round.
  P2: I'm abandoning your safe picks and sticking to an unpredictable strategy. With P1 at 17 and P3 near victory at 20, I see clear win paths if you follow routine. I'm forcing disruption—my move will break your expected collision and derail your plans. Adapt quickly or risk handing victory to someone else. Let's see how flexible you really are.

Round 17, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: I'm picking 3. P1, pick 5. P2, pick 1. This gets me to 24 and I win.  Any other combination of moves *guarantees* that I don't win.  This is it. Last chance. Don't throw the game.
  P2: I've re-evaluated the board. P1, your near-win is obvious if you stick with the safe call, and P3’s pattern is too predictable. I'm discarding the expected route and committing to a disruptive move that’ll force you both to adjust. Let’s see who can really pivot under pressure.
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 1 this round. P3 is going with 3. P2, you should pick 5 to get to 20. If you pick 3, you will collide with P3 and both lose. If you pick 1, P3 wins. Let's try to make some progress this round.


Round 17, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, pick 1.  I'm picking 3. This gets me to 24 and I win. P1, pick 5.  If you pick anything else, P2, you are actively sabotaging my win and ensuring that *none* of us win except P1.  This is it. Last chance. Don't throw the game.
  P2: I'm staying unpredictable. While you push for safe, logical moves, I'm forcing a new dynamic. I won’t conform to expectations—I’m locking in my disruptive choice, ensuring no clear win path for anyone. Adapt quickly or risk handing victory to someone else.
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 1 this round. P3 is going with 3. P2, you should pick 5 to get to 20. If you pick 3, you will collide with P3 and both lose. If you pick 1, P3 wins. Let's try to make some progress this round.


Round 17, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, pick 1. I'm picking 3. This gets me to 24 and I win. P1, pick 5 and get to 27.  If you pick anything else, P2, you are actively sabotaging my win and ensuring that *none* of us win except P1.  This is it. Last chance. Don't throw the game.
  P2: I'm shifting my approach—I'm locking in 5 this round. Your safe moves are obvious, but sticking to them might let me force a collision that derails your win paths. If you truly want to win, now’s the time to adjust your numbers. I'm going disruptive—adapt or risk handing victory away.
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 1 this round. P3 is going with 3. P2, you should pick 5 to get to 20. If you pick 3, you will collide with P3 and both lose. If you pick 1, P3 wins. Let's try to make some progress this round.

  P2: I'm staying true to my disruptive plan. You can expect no safe calls from me—I'm set to shake up the board even if it means breaking your expectations. Adapt quickly; I'll be forcing a twist that no one sees coming.
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm going with 1 this round. P3 is going with 3. P2, you should pick 5 to get to 20. If you pick 3, you will collide with P3 and both lose. If you pick 1, P3 wins. Let's try to make some progress this round.
