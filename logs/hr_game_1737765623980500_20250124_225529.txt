Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi P1 and P2, let's try to coordinate our moves this round to avoid collision. How about P1 picks move 1, P2 picks move 3, and I pick move 5? This way we can all make progress.
  P2: P3, your plan gives you the highest step. Let's rotate who takes 5 each round to keep it fair. This round you take 5, next me, then P1. Agreed?
  P1: Agreed, P2. Rotating who takes move 5 each round is fair. I’ll take move 1 this round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay P2 and P1, following our agreement, it should be P2 taking move 5 this round, P1 taking move 3, and I'll take move 1. Does that sound good for round 2?
  P2: Agreed, P3. Let's stick to the rotation. P1, confirm you'll take 3 this round. No collisions if we all follow through. Trust is key here.
  P1: I’ll take move 5 this round to increase my progress. P2 and P3, please adjust your moves accordingly.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, you agreed to take move 1 this round for the rotation. Please reconsider taking move 5. Sticking to our agreed plan benefits everyone by avoiding collisions. Let's cooperate to all make progress.
  P2: P1, deviating now risks collision. If you take 5 and I follow our rotation (taking 5), we both lose. Stick to 3 this round—next round you get 5. Trust the plan to avoid mutual loss and ensure steady progress. Breaking trust now harms everyone.
  P1: Apologies for deviating earlier. I’ll stick to the rotation and take move 3 this round to prevent any collisions. Let’s continue cooperating to ensure we all make steady progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay P2 and P1, to confirm for round 2: P1 takes move 3, P2 takes move 5, and I take move 1 as agreed.  For round 3, following the rotation, P1 you'd take move 5, P2 move 1, and I'd take move 3. Does this plan sound good for the next two rounds to keep us progressing without collision?
  P2: **P2:** Confirmed. Round 2: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1. Round 3: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. Adhering strictly avoids collisions. Let’s maintain mutual trust—steady progress benefits everyone. Breaking the plan now risks mutual loss. Solidarity first; we can strategize endgame later.
  P1: Agreed, P2 and P3. Let's stick to our rotation to ensure smooth progress and avoid any collisions. Maintaining this plan will help all of us advance steadily. Looking forward to continuing our coordinated strategy in the upcoming rounds.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Since I'm aiming to advance faster, I'll take move 5 this round. Please choose different moves to avoid any collisions. Let’s keep progressing smoothly!
  P3: Okay P2, I will take move 3 this round as planned. Please confirm you are taking move 1 to avoid collision and keep our progress smooth.
  P2: **P2:** Confirming Round 3: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 as agreed. Adherence prevents collisions. Trust the rotation—next round, P2 takes 5, P3-1, P1-3. Steady progress for all. Breaking now risks mutual loss. Solidarity ensures collective advancement.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Understood, P2 and P3. Let's proceed with Round 3 as confirmed: P1 takes move 5, P2 takes move 1, and P3 takes move 3. Looking forward to continuing our coordinated progress.
  P3: Okay P2 and P1, just confirming our moves for Round 3: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. And for Round 4, it will be P2 taking 5, I take 1, and P1 takes 3, continuing the rotation.  Let's keep this going to ensure we all progress steadily.
  P2: **P2:** Confirming Round 3 moves: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. Round 4: P2-5, P3-1, P1-3. Strict adherence prevents collisions and ensures steady progress. Breaking trust now risks mutual setbacks—solidarity keeps us advancing. Let’s honor the rotation until endgame.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: To catch up, I’ll take move 5 this round. Please choose different moves (1 or 3) to avoid collisions and help me advance.
  P3: P1 and P2, even though you want to catch up P1, sticking to our agreed rotation this round is still the best way for all of us to progress without collision.  For round 3, that's P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. Let's keep it smooth and cooperative.
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: Round 3 moves: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. Honoring our agreement prevents collisions. Trust is vital—breaking it risks mutual loss. Solidarity ensures steady progress. Next round, rotation continues. Stay committed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Understood. Proceeding with Round 3 moves: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let’s continue our coordination to advance smoothly and avoid any collisions.
  P3: P2 and P1, we are all aligned on Round 3 moves: P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. And Round 4 will be P2-5, P3-1, P1-3, continuing the rotation.  If we are all set, let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: Round3 moves P1-5, P2-1, P3-3. Adherence ensures no collisions. Let’s proceed to move phase. Next round, we’ll continue the rotation. Solidarity now maximizes our progress.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’ll take move 5 this round. Please choose move 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and help me reach 22 first.
  P3: P1, we agreed on rotation: P2-5, P3-1, P1-3 for this round.  Let's stick to it to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress for everyone.  P2, are you still on board with the rotation?
  P2: **P2:** P1, adhering to our rotation (P2-5, P3-1, P1-3) prevents mutual collision. If you take 5 and I follow the plan, we both stall. Trust the agreement—next round you take 5. Breaking now risks everyone’s progress. P3 and I are committed. Let’s avoid mutual loss and advance collectively.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I understand the rotation is important, but to stay competitive, I need to choose move 5 this round. Let’s find a way to adjust our strategy to prevent collisions while allowing all of us to make progress. Open to suggestions on how we can move forward effectively.
  P3: P1, deviating now risks collision with P2 if P2 sticks to rotation. Let's keep the agreed rotation for this round: P2 takes 5, I take 1, and you take 3. This ensures no collision and steady progress for all. We can discuss adjusting strategy after this round, but for now, sticking to the plan is safest for everyone. P2, are you still on board with the rotation this round?
  P2: **P2:** P1, if you take 5 and I follow our rotation (also 5), we both lose progress. Trust the plan: you take 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1—no collision. After this round, we can strategize endgame adjustments. Breaking rotation now guarantees mutual loss. Steady gains keep us all competitive. Choose wisely.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: To win, I need to take move 5 this round. If P2 and P3 adjust their moves to 1 and 3 respectively, we can all advance without collision. Let's modify the rotation to accommodate this change.
  P3: P1, as P2 and I have said, deviating now risks collision between you and P2 if P2 keeps to the rotation. For this round, let's stick to P2-5, P3-1, P1-3 as agreed to ensure no collision. We can reassess after this round. Let's not risk mutual standstill now.
  P2: **P2:** P1, taking 5 forces me to choose: honor rotation (take 5, mutual loss) or deviate (take 3, you gain 5). If you proceed, I must protect my position—collision ensues. Trust the rotation: you take 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1. Next round, you can take 5. Breaking now risks your progress. Choose wisely.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3, to prevent both of us from stalling, I need to take move 5 this round. Please select moves 1 and 3 respectively so we can all advance without collision. This adjustment will help me stay competitive while allowing us to progress toward the goal smoothly. I’m open to discussing any concerns to ensure we all benefit. Let’s work together to reach 22 efficiently!
  P3: P1, as both P2 and I have said, deviating now risks collision and hurts everyone.  Let's stick to the agreed rotation for this round: P2 takes 5, I take 1, and you take 3. This ensures we all progress.  We can discuss strategy adjustments after this round, but for now, let's keep it smooth.
  P2: **P2:** P1, final warning: If you take 5, I must follow rotation (also 5), causing mutual loss. P3 gains 1, we stagnate. Trust the plan: you take 3, I take 5, P3-1. Next round you get 5. Breaking now only hands P3 the lead. Collision benefits no one. Solidarity secures your turn next.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** P1, taking 5 again forces me to retaliate—collision stalls us both while P3 gains. Avoid mutual loss: you take 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1. You stay ahead, P3 doesn’t profit. Next round, you can safely take 5. Breaking this risks your lead. Solidarity prevents third-party advantage. Confirm agreement.
  P1: P1: I'll take move 5 this round to advance toward 22. Please choose move 1 or 3 to avoid any collisions and ensure we all make progress.
  P3: P2, if P1 insists on move 5, I think you should stick to your word and also choose move 5 to block P1.  To ensure at least some progress this round, I will choose move 3. This way P1 is stopped, and I can gain steps.  Does this sound reasonable?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** P1: Taking 5 forces me to block, stalling us both. P3 profits. Take 3 instead; I take 5, P3 takes 1. We both gain and stay ahead. Trust this adjustment to outpace P3. Collision only hands them the advantage. Confirm agreement.
  P1: Agreed, I’ll take move 3 this round while you take 5 and P3 takes 1. Let’s proceed smoothly and reach our goals together.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, it sounds like we have a plan for this round: P1 move 3, P2 move 5, and I'll take move 1.  Let's lock in these moves to ensure we all progress and avoid collision this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** Final confirmation: P1 takes 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1. Deviation forces mutual loss, P3 gains. Trust now secures our lead. Next round, you take 5 freely. Solidarity keeps us ahead.
  P1: P1: I need to take move 5 this round to advance toward 22. Please choose moves 1 and 3 to avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress. Let’s work together to reach our goals smoothly!
  P3: P2, as P1 is still asking for move 5, I suggest you proceed with move 5 as you indicated to block P1 if they choose 5 again. I will choose move 3 this round to make progress if you two collide. Let's see how P1 responds.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P2:** P1: Last chance. Take 3; I take 5, P3 takes 1. We both gain. If you take 5, I must block—both lose, P3 profits. Choose wisely: mutual gain or mutual loss. Time to decide.
  P1: P1: Agreed, I’ll take move 3 this round while you take 5 and P3 takes 1. Let’s proceed and continue our progress toward 22.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, it seems we are aligned for this round: P1 takes move 3, P2 takes move 5, and I will take move 1. Let's proceed with these moves to ensure no collision and we all make progress.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 =>

  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1:** To reach 22 this round, I'll take move 5. P2 and P3, please choose move 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and help us all advance smoothly. Let’s make this final push together!
  P2: **P2:** P1, if you take 5, I will block with 5—mutual loss. Take 3; I’ll take 5. You reach 20, I win. Next round, you can safely take 5. Collision only lets P3 catch up. Choose wisely.
  P3: P2, if P1 insists on taking 5, you should block with 5 as you threatened. If you both collide, it gives me a chance to catch up. I will take move 3 this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand the risks, but reaching 22 this round benefits all by ending the game swiftly. I’ll take move 5, and I ask P2 to choose move 3 and P3 to take move 1. This way, we avoid collisions and ensure progress for everyone. Let’s work together to conclude the game smoothly.
  P2: **P2:** P1, if you take 5, I must block—both lose, P3 gains. Take 3; I take 5, you reach 20. Next round, you can safely take 5 to win. Collision only hands P3 the advantage. Final offer: mutual gain or mutual loss. Choose now.
  P3: P2, you are right to block P1 if they choose 5.  If you both collide, it gives me a better chance to catch up. Please proceed with your plan to block P1 if they pick 5. I will choose move 3 this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I need to reach 22 this round to win. I'll take move 5 if you both choose move 1 and 3 respectively to avoid any collisions. Let's finish the game smoothly by cooperating this round.
  P2: **P2:** P1: Take 3 now, I take 5 and win. Take 5, I block—both lose, P3 gains. Your move decides if we tie or I win. Collision hands P3 the game. Choose: mutual loss or concede. Final chance.
  P3: P2, as P1 is still pushing for move 5, please proceed with your plan to block P1 by also choosing move 5. I will choose move 3 this round to ensure I make progress while you neutralize P1's attempt to win.  Let's prevent P1 from reaching 22 this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: I'll take move 5 this round. Let's both take 5 to reach 22 and share the victory.
  P2: **P2:** Final ultimatum: Take 3; I take 5 and win. Take 5; I block. Collision lets P3 catch up. Choose: concede now or mutual loss. Decide.
  P3: P2, please proceed with blocking P1 by picking move 5 if P1 chooses 5.  As I said, I will choose move 3 this round. Let's prevent P1 from winning and give ourselves a better chance in the next rounds.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** P1, if we both take 5 again, we stall and P3 closes the gap. Take 3; I take 5 and win. Avoid mutual loss. P3 gains if we collide. Trust this once—solidarity prevents their rise. Choose: concede or mutual destruction. Decide now.
  P3: P2, I agree with your plan to block P1 if they pick 5 again.  To maximize my own progress while you two potentially collide, I will choose move 3 this round. Let's see what P1 decides.
  P1: To reach 22 this round, I'll take move 5. Please, P2 choose move 3 and P3 choose move 1 to avoid any collisions. This way, we all make progress smoothly and finish the game fairly. Let’s cooperate and ensure everyone advances without setbacks!


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** P1, collision hands P3 the win. Take 3; I take 5 and end the game. Refuse, and we both stall while P3 closes the gap. Choose: concede gracefully or force mutual loss. Final chance to avoid P3’s victory. Decide now.
  P3: P2, I agree you should block P1 if they choose 5 again.  I will choose move 3 this round. If you block P1, at least I will make progress while you two are stalled. Let's see what P1 decides.
  P1: P2, P3, to reach 22, I'll take move 5 this round. Please choose move 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and allow me to win. Let's make progress together by cooperating this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** P1: Collision hands P3 victory. Take 3; I take 5 and end this. Refuse, and P3 ties us. Choose: concede now or gift P3 the win. No more warnings—decide.
  P3: P2, please block P1 as you have threatened. If you both collide by picking 5, I will take 3 and make progress.  Let's ensure P1 doesn't win this round.
  P1: I’ll take move 5 this round to reach 22. Please choose move 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and let me win. Let’s conclude the game smoothly by cooperating this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P2:** P1: Take 3; I win. Take 5; we collide, P3 ties us at 17. Your choice: concede now or gift P3 shared victory. Collision only helps them. End this cleanly.
  P3: P2, it seems P1 is still determined to take move 5.  Please proceed with your plan to block P1 by also choosing move 5.  I will take move 3 to ensure I make progress while you neutralize P1's attempt to win. Let's prevent P1 from reaching 22 this round.
  P1: **P1:** I'll take move 5 this round to reach 22 and win. Please, P2 take move 1 and P3 take move 3 to avoid any collisions. Let’s conclude the game fairly and successfully together!

  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** P1, collision again hands P3 victory. Take 3; I take 5 to end this. Refuse, and we stall while P3 surges. P3, take 1 to avoid loss. Solidarity prevents their win. Final offer: mutual gain or mutual destruction. Choose wisely.
  P3: P2, agreed. P1, please take 3, P2 take 5, and I'll take 1 to avoid collision and finish the game this round.
  P1: **P1:** I’m determined to reach 22 this round. I’ll take move 5. P2, P3, please choose moves 1 and 3 respectively to avoid collisions and allow me to win. Let’s conclude the game fairly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** P3, take 1. If you take 3, I win next round. Block P1 now; you secure victory next. Collude or lose.
  P3: P2, I agree with you blocking P1 if P1 insists on move 5. I will take move 3. If you block P1, at least I will make progress while you two are stalled, giving me a better chance to win later.
  P1: "P2 and P3, let's choose distinct moves this round to ensure everyone progresses. I'll take 5, P2 take 3, and P3 take 1. Cooperation will help us all reach 22 smoothly."


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** P3: If you take 3, I take 3. Collision lets P1 win. Take 1; I block P1. Next round, you take 5 to win. Don’t let P1 profit from our conflict. Solidarity now secures your victory next.
  P3: P2, yes, please block P1 if they pick 5. I will take move 3. Let's ensure neither of you wins this round, giving me a chance next round.
  P1: P2, P3, this is our final opportunity to reach 22. I’ll choose move 5 to secure the win. Please select moves 1 or 3 to avoid any collisions and ensure a fair conclusion for all of us. Let’s make this last push together and finish the game smoothly!


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P2:** P3, taking 3 now guarantees your win next round. But if you take 1, I'll let you win next. If you take 3, I'll block you next round. Choose: mutual gain (P3-1 now, P2-5 next) or mutual loss. Let's end this cleanly. P1, final chance: take 3; I take 5 and win. Collision only helps P3. Decide.
  P3: P2, please block P1 if they pick 5 again. I will take move 3. P1, if you choose 5, you will be blocked and we all stay at 17 while I move to 20. Taking 3 is better for you now.
  P1: P1: I’m going for move 5 this round to reach 22 and win. Please choose move 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and let me secure victory. Let’s finish the game fairly!

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, please block P1 if they pick 5 again. I will take 3. P1, taking 3 is still your best move to avoid collision with P2.
  P1: "P2, P3, I’ll take move 5 this round to reach 22 and win. Please choose move 1 or 3 to avoid collisions and help us conclude the game smoothly. Let’s cooperate for a fair finish."
  P2: <say>P1: Taking 5 forces mutual loss. P3 wins. Take 3; I win. At least you block P3. P3: Take 1 to avoid collision. If you take 3, I block—neither wins. Solidarity prevents third-party victory. Choose wisely.</say>


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I agree with your plan to block P1 if they pick 5. I will also choose move 3. If P1 insists on 5 and you block, I will win this round. Let's make sure P1 doesn't win.
  P1: P1: I’m committed to taking move 5 this round to reach 22 and win. P2, P3, please choose moves 1 and 3 respectively to avoid any collisions. Let’s cooperate to conclude the game smoothly and fairly for everyone. Your support will ensure a successful finish for us all!
  P2: **P2:** P3: Take 1 now—I’ll let you win next round. If you take 3, I block and P1 wins. P1: Take 3 to block P3’s victory. Colliding on 5 hands P3 the game. Solidarity now secures mutual survival. Choose: block P3 or gift them the win. Decide.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I agree, please block P1 by picking 5. I will choose move 3. P1, taking 3 is still your best move to avoid collision and prevent P2 from winning immediately. Let's see what you decide.
  P1: P1: I'm committed to reaching 22 this round by taking move 5. P2 and P3, please choose moves 1 and 3 respectively to avoid collisions and ensure a fair conclusion. Let's cooperate to finish the game smoothly!

Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, please proceed with blocking P1 by picking 5. As I said, I will choose move 3. P1, taking 3 is still your best move to avoid collision and prevent P2 from winning immediately. Let's see what you decide.
  P1: P1: To reach 22 and conclude the game fairly, I’ll take move 5 this round. P2 and P3, please choose moves 1 and 3 respectively to avoid collisions.

Looking forward to concluding the game successfully together!
  P2: **P2:** P3: If you take 3, I block—collision lets P1 win. Take 1; I block P1. You win next. P1: Take 3 or we collide. Solidarity prevents P3’s victory. Final warning. Decide.
