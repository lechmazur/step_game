Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey everyone, let's keep this first round simple and fair. How about we each pick a different number to avoid collisions? I'm willing to take 1. What do you guys think?
  P3: Sounds good to me, P1. I'll take 3 then. P2, you can have 5.  Let's get this game moving.
  P2: I’m fine with the plan. I’ll take 5 as suggested. Let’s keep it straightforward for now and see how it plays out. No surprises this round—let’s all move forward equally.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Great, glad we're all aligned. Let's stick to the plan and build some trust early.
  P3: Okay, sounds like we have a plan.  Just confirming - I'm going for 3, P2 is taking 5, and P1 is taking 1.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s mix it up this round. I’ll consider switching my move to keep things unpredictable. P1, you might want to avoid 1 again since it’s too obvious. P3, sticking to 3 could work for you, but we should coordinate better to prevent collisions. Let’s aim for a clear path forward—share your thoughts or plans so we can adjust accordingly. If we all pick differently, we can advance without issues. What do you say?
  P3: I'm sticking with 3 this round.  P2, if you're thinking of switching, maybe go for 1?  P1, if you avoid 1, 5 seems like the logical choice. Let's try to avoid a collision again.
  P1: Alright, P2, if you prefer switching things up, I'll take 5 this round. You can safely go for 1. P3, sticking with 3 is fine. Let's keep it straightforward again to maintain trust.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m fine with the plan—let’s keep it clean this round. I’ll take 1 as suggested, P1 can go for 5, and P3 sticks with 3. No need to overcomplicate things; we all advance without collisions. Let’s confirm and move forward.
  P3: Sounds good.  Confirming again - I'm going with 3, P1 is taking 5, and P2 is taking 1.  Let's keep this smooth.
  P1: Perfect, we're all clear. Let's lock it in and keep the momentum going.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s keep the momentum going—no need to overthink this round. I’ll stick with 1 again; it’s working well so far. P1, you can safely take 5, and P3, 3 seems like a solid choice for you. If we all stay consistent, we avoid collisions and advance equally. Trust is key here—let’s confirm our moves and keep pushing forward. What do you say?
  P3: Okay, I'm getting a little bored with this predictability.  How about we shake things up? I'm thinking of going for 5 this round.  P1, maybe you take 1, and P2, you could try 3?  Or if you prefer, we could randomize it completely.  Thoughts?
  P1: I agree, P3—let's mix things up to keep it interesting. I'm open to taking 1 this round if you're set on 5. P2, are you good with grabbing 3? Let's confirm clearly to avoid collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m fine with switching things up, but let’s ensure we don’t collide. If P3 is set on 5, I’ll take 3 this round, and P1 can safely go for 1. That way, we all advance without issues. Trust is key—if we stick to this plan, we keep momentum going while keeping it unpredictable. Confirm your moves so we’re all aligned before the move phase. Let’s do this cleanly.
  P3: Okay, let's lock this in. I'm taking 5. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3.  Confirm so we can move on.
  P1: Confirmed, I'm taking 1 this round. Let's keep this smooth and fair.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's keep the collaborative spirit but introduce a little controlled chaos. I'm aiming for 5.  P1, how about 3? P2, you could go for 1.  If anyone feels strongly against this, speak now, otherwise let's lock it in and move.
