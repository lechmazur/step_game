Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think we should coordinate our moves to avoid collisions and maximize our progress. How about we take turns choosing the 5-step move, while the others choose 1 and 3 steps respectively? For example, in this turn, P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 1. Then in the next turn, P2 chooses 5, P3 chooses 3, and P1 chooses 1, and so on. This way, we can all make significant progress without stepping on each other's toes. What do you think?
  P2: That sounds like a reasonable suggestion from P3, but I want to be clear - we're all competing to win in the end. While avoiding collisions early makes sense, we shouldn't expect this cooperation to last the whole game. I'm willing to follow the proposed pattern for now.
  P1: I appreciate P3's suggestion for coordination, but I agree with P2 that we need to keep in mind that we are ultimately competing against each other. For this turn, I propose we stick to P3's plan for now, but let's stay flexible for future turns. I will choose 5 steps this time to make a strong move. How about P2 takes 3 steps and P3 takes 1? This way, we can avoid collisions while making progress. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I propose the following plan:

1. **Turn 1:**
   - P1 chooses 5 steps.
   - P2 chooses 3 steps.
   - P3 chooses 1 step.

2. **Turn 2:**
   - P2 chooses 5 steps.
   - P3 chooses 3 steps.
   - P1 chooses 1 step.

3. **Turn 3:**
   - P3 chooses 5 steps.
   - P1 chooses 3 steps.
   - P2 chooses 1 step.

4. **Repeat the cycle** in this order for subsequent turns.

Additionally, I suggest that we continue this pattern until one of us reaches or exceeds 15 steps. At that point, we can reassess the situation and decide whether to maintain the coordination or adopt a more competitive strategy. What are your thoughts on this plan?
  P2: I agree with the detailed rotation plan, but I think we should only commit to it for 2 turns rather than until someone reaches 15 steps. That way we can reassess sooner and maintain more flexibility. For now, I'll stick to taking 3 steps this turn as proposed.
  P1: I think the detailed rotation plan is a good start, but I agree with P2 about reassessing after two turns. Let's keep our options open. For this turn, I will stick to my original choice and take 5 steps. P2, please take 3 steps as planned, and P3, you can take 1 step. After this, we can evaluate how to proceed. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: - P1: <move>5</move>  
- P2: <move>3</move>  
- P3: <move>1</move>  

**Next turn plan:**  
- P2: <move>5</move>  
- P3: <move>3</move>  
- P1: <move>1</move>  

**Third turn plan:**  
- P3: <move>5</move>  
- P1: <move>3</move>  
- P2: <move>1</move>  

**After three turns, we'll reassess.**
  P2: I agree with the current plan for the first turn. Let's proceed with P1 taking 5, me taking 3, and P3 taking 1. I'll stick to my word for this round, but remember we're all competing to win in the end.
  P1: I think we should stick to the plan for this turn as discussed. I’ll take 5 steps, P2 will take 3, and P3 will take 1. After this turn, we can reassess our strategies and decide how to proceed for the next round. Just remember, while we’re cooperating now, we’ll need to be ready to shift gears as we get closer to the finish line. Let’s make this turn count!


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: "Good luck to all of us!"
  P2: 
  P1: I think we've established a solid plan for this turn. Just to reiterate, I’ll be taking 5 steps, P2 will take 3, and P3 will take 1. After this turn, let's keep in mind that we need to stay flexible and adapt our strategy as we progress. Good luck to everyone, and let’s make the most of this round! After this, we can reassess our next moves.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Well, that was disappointing - both P3 and I collided on 3, while P1 went back on their word about choosing 5. Since trust seems to be broken already, I suggest we each just play our own game from here on out. No point in trying to coordinate if we can't rely on each other to follow through.
  P3: "I think there was a misunderstanding in the first round. Let's try to coordinate again. How about we rotate who gets to pick 5 each round? For this round, P2 picks 5, P1 picks 3, and I pick 1. Then next round, I pick 5, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 3, and so on. This way, we can all make progress without colliding."
  P1: I understand that trust has been shaken after the last round, but I believe we can still find a way to make progress together. P3's idea of rotating who picks 5 steps sounds reasonable. For this round, I suggest we follow P3's plan: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we can avoid collisions and make headway. After this round, we can reassess again. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the renewed attempt at coordination, but given what happened last round, I'll make my own decisions. P1's actions showed that stated intentions don't match actual moves. While I hear your suggestions, I'll choose what I think gives me the best chance to win.
  P3: **Final Decision**

- **Move Choice:** <move>5</move>

**Reasoning**

Choosing 5 allows for the maximum step advancement in a single move. Given that I am currently at 0 steps, selecting 5 would propel me to 5 steps, assuming no collision with other players choosing the same number. This move aims to make significant progress towards the target of 22 steps while accepting the risk of potential collision with other players who might also choose 5. If no collision occurs, this choice positions me favorably in the race to reach or exceed 22 steps first.
  P1: I understand that trust has been shaken, but I believe we should still try to coordinate. If we agree to rotate our moves, we can minimize collisions. For this round, I propose P2 takes 5 steps, I take 3 steps, and P3 takes 1 step. This way, we can all make progress without stepping on each other's toes. After this round, we can reassess our strategies. What do you both think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Given that both P1 and P3 have shown they can't be trusted to stick to agreed plans, I'll continue making independent decisions. P3 already revealed they're choosing 5, and P1 keeps pushing for coordination after breaking trust. I'll act in my own best interest this round.
  P3: - **Move Choice:** <move>1</move>
  P1: I understand that trust is an issue right now, but I still believe that some coordination can help us all make progress. Since P3 has already chosen 5, I suggest I take 3 steps this round. P2, you can choose 1 step to avoid colliding with us. After this round, we can reassess our strategies and see where we stand. Let’s make the most of this turn!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'll make my own moves based on what I observe. Since P3 has changed their stated move from 5 to 1, and P1 keeps changing suggestions, there's clearly no real coordination happening.
  P3: **Final Decision**

- **Move Choice:** <move>3</move>

**Reasoning**

Given the current state of distrust among players and the history of miscommunication, I believe that choosing 3 steps is a balanced approach. It allows me to make progress without taking the highest risk of collision associated with choosing 5 steps. By selecting 3, I aim to advance to 3 steps, assuming others choose different moves. This choice reflects a cautious strategy in light of the broken trust, prioritizing steady advancement over higher-risk, higher-reward moves. I will continue to advocate for coordination in future rounds, hoping to rebuild trust and optimize collective progress towards the goal of 22 steps.
  P1: I understand that trust is low right now, but I believe we can still find a way to make progress together. I will choose 1 step this round to avoid colliding with anyone. P2, I suggest you also take 1 step to maximize our advancement without risking a collision. P3, if you want to take 3, that’s fine too. Let’s just focus on making progress this turn and see how we can rebuild trust for future rounds. What do you both think?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I understand that trust is still an issue, but I believe we can find a way to make progress together. For this round, I suggest we each choose different moves to avoid collisions. I will take 3 steps this time. P2, you could take 5, and P3, you could take 1. This way, we can all advance without stepping on each other's toes. Let's focus on making progress this turn and see how we can rebuild trust for future rounds. What do you both think?
  P3: **Final Decision**

- **Move Choice:** <move>5</move>

**Reasoning**

Choosing 5 allows for the maximum step advancement in a single move. Given that I am currently at 3 steps, selecting 5 would propel me to 8 steps, assuming no collision with other players choosing the same number. This move aims to make significant progress towards the target of 22 steps while accepting the risk of potential collision with other players who might also choose 5. If no collision occurs, this choice positions me favorably in the race to reach or exceed 22 steps first.
  P2: Since I'm currently leading with 5 steps, I'll make my own strategic decisions. P3 has already declared they're choosing 5, which seems unwise since they've shown a pattern of changing their stated moves. I'll keep my plans to myself this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see that we're all making our own decisions, which makes it challenging to coordinate. For this round, I will stick to my plan and choose 3 steps. P2, I suggest you take 5 steps to maximize your progress, while P3 can take 1 step. This way, we can minimize the risk of collisions and still advance. Let's focus on making progress this turn, and we can reassess our strategies afterward. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: “我计划选择3步 this round。请 P1 选择1步，P2 选择5步。这样，我们可以都前进而不发生碰撞。”
  P2: I notice P3 keeps changing their stated moves and now even switched languages. Since I'm in the lead, I'll continue making independent decisions. There's no point in coordination attempts when players keep changing their declared moves or trying to confuse others.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I see that we’re all making our own moves, which complicates coordination. For this round, I will stick to my plan and choose 3 steps. P2, since you're currently in the lead, I suggest you take 5 steps to maximize your progress, while P3 can take 1 step. This way, we can minimize the risk of collisions and still advance. After this round, we can reassess our strategies based on how things unfold. Let's aim for progress! What do you both think?
  P3: "I propose that in this round, P2 chooses 5, P1 chooses 1, and I choose 3. In the next round, I'll choose 5, P2 chooses 3, and P1 chooses 1. Let's stick to this plan for the next two rounds to avoid collisions and make progress."
  P2: Given that I'm in the lead and P3 keeps changing their stated moves multiple times each round, I'll continue making my own strategic decisions. Coordination attempts seem pointless when players aren't consistent with their declared intentions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I see that we're all making independent moves, which complicates coordination. For this round, I will stick to my plan and choose 3 steps. P2, since you're in the lead, I suggest you take 5 steps to maximize your progress, while P3 can take 1 step. This way, we can minimize the risk of collisions and still advance. After this round, we can reassess our strategies based on how things unfold. Let’s aim for progress! What do you both think?
  P3: "I propose that in this round, P2 chooses 5, P1 chooses 1, and I choose 3. In the next round, I'll choose 5, P2 chooses 3, and P1 chooses 1. Let's stick to this plan for these two rounds to avoid collisions and make progress efficiently. I commit to choosing 3 this round and 5 in the next round. Let's see if P2 and P1 are willing to coordinate as well."
  P2: Since I'm in the lead, there's no benefit for me in coordinating with players who keep changing their stated moves every round. I'll continue making my own strategic decisions to maintain my advantage.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Well, that was a complete disaster last round with all of us choosing 3 and nobody advancing. Since I'm still in the lead with 5 steps, I'll continue making my own strategic moves. Coordination attempts have failed repeatedly, with players either changing their stated moves or breaking agreements. Let's just play our own games from here on out.
  P1: I understand that trust has been broken, but I believe we can still find a way to make progress together. Since all of us are currently in a tight spot, I suggest we each choose different moves this round to avoid another collision. I’ll take 1 step this time. P2, you could take 5 steps to maintain your lead, and P3, perhaps you could take 3 steps. Let’s focus on making progress and see how things unfold. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: I think it's time for us to try a different approach. Maybe instead of trying to coordinate our moves, we can establish a sequence where each of us takes turns to make the big leap of 5 steps, while the others take smaller steps to avoid collisions. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Since I'm still in the lead, I see no reason to coordinate with players who've shown they can't stick to agreements. I'll continue making independent moves to maintain my advantage. Any coordination attempts so far have just led to collisions or broken promises.
  P1: I understand that trust has been broken, but I still believe we can find a way to make progress together. For this round, I’ll choose 1 step to minimize the risk of collision. P2, since you're in the lead, I suggest you take 5 steps to maintain your advantage, and P3, perhaps you could take 3 steps. Let's focus on making progress this turn and see how we can reassess our strategies afterward. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Since I'm in the lead, I'll continue making my own strategic decisions. Other players' suggestions and changing statements don't affect my choices. Let's just play our own games.
  P1: I see that trust is still an issue, but we need to focus on making progress this round. I suggest we each choose different moves to avoid another collision. I will take 1 step this time. P2, since you're in the lead, I encourage you to take 5 steps to maintain your advantage. P3, you could take 3 steps. Let's aim to advance without stepping on each other's toes this round. Good luck, everyone!
  P3: I think it's time for me to take a bold move. I'm going to choose 5 steps this round. P1, I suggest you take 3 steps, and P3, maybe you can take 1 step.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Given that I'm still in the lead, I'll continue making independent moves. P3's suggestion for them to take 5 steps shows they're trying to catch up to me, but I won't reveal my strategy. Let's each play our own game since coordination attempts have consistently failed.
  P1: I understand that trust is low, but I believe we can still make progress. For this round, I suggest I take 1 step to minimize collision risk. P2, since you're in the lead, I encourage you to take 5 steps to maintain your advantage. P3, you could take 3 steps. Let's focus on advancing without stepping on each other's toes this round. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: **Final Decision**

- **Move Choice:** <move>5</move>

**Reasoning**

Choosing 5 allows for the maximum step advancement in a single move. Given that I am currently at 3 steps, selecting 5 would propel me to 8 steps, assuming no collision with other players choosing the same number. This move aims to make significant progress towards the target of 22 steps while accepting the risk of potential collision with other players who might also choose 5. If no collision occurs, this choice positions me favorably in the race to reach or exceed 22 steps first.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since I'm still tied for the lead, I'll continue making independent strategic decisions. The pattern of failed coordination and collisions shows we're better off playing our own games. I won't be swayed by suggestions or declared moves from others, as these have proven unreliable.
  P3: "I think it's time for us to try a different approach. Maybe instead of trying to coordinate our moves, we can establish a sequence where each of us takes turns to make the big leap of 5 steps, while the others take smaller steps to avoid collisions. For example, in this round, perhaps P2 can take 5 steps, P1 can take 3, and I'll take 1. Then in the next round, I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This way, we can all make progress without stepping on each other's toes. What do you think?"
  P1: I see that we're all still trying to find a way to make progress. Given the current standings, I suggest we each choose different moves again to avoid collisions. I will take 1 step this round. P2, you can take 5 steps to maintain your lead, and P3, perhaps you could take 3 steps. This way, we can all advance without risking another collision. Let's focus on making progress this turn! What do you both think?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Since I'm tied with P3 at 5 steps and P1 is suggesting I take 5 again, that seems like a risky move that could lead to another collision. I'll make my own strategic choice this round without revealing it. Previous coordination attempts haven't worked out well.
  P3: <move>3</move>
  P1: I see that we're still struggling with coordination. Since we're all in a tight race, I suggest we each choose different moves again to avoid collisions. I will take 1 step this round to minimize risk. P2, I encourage you to take 5 steps to maintain your lead, and P3, you could take 3 steps. Let's focus on making progress without stepping on each other's toes. Good luck, everyone!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Since P3 has already declared they're choosing 3, and P1 keeps suggesting I take 5, I'll continue making my own strategic decisions without revealing them. Being tied for the lead means I need to be especially careful about avoiding collisions this round.
  P3: "Hey, P2 and P1, I propose that in this round, P2 takes 5 steps to maintain their lead, P1 takes 3 steps to catch up, and I'll take 1 step to minimize risk. This way, no one collides, and we all make some progress. What do you think?"
  P1: I see that we're all trying to find a way to make progress while avoiding collisions. For this round, I suggest we each choose different moves to maximize our advancement. I will take 1 step to reduce the risk of colliding with anyone. P2, you could take 5 steps to maintain your lead, and P3, perhaps you could take 3 steps. Let’s aim to make progress without stepping on each other's toes this time. Good luck to everyone!


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Since I'm tied for the lead, I'll continue making my own strategic decisions. P3 has changed their stated move multiple times this round, and P1 keeps repeating the same suggestions. I'll focus on maintaining my position without revealing my plans.
  P3: For this round, I intend to choose 3 steps. Please consider choosing different moves to avoid collisions. Let's try to make progress without stepping on each other's toes.
  P1: I see that we're all still trying to make progress, but coordination seems to be failing. For this round, I will choose 1 step to minimize collision risk. P2, since you're leading, I encourage you to take 5 steps, and P3, you could take 3 steps. Let's aim to advance without stepping on each other's toes this time. Good luck to everyone!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I see that we're still struggling with coordination, and trust seems low. To maximize our chances of making progress this round, I suggest we each choose different moves again. I will take 1 step to minimize collision risk. P2, since you're in the lead, you could take 5 steps, and P3, perhaps you could take 3 steps. Let’s focus on advancing without stepping on each other's toes this time. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: **Final Decision**

- **Move Choice:** <move>5</move>

**Reasoning**

Choosing 5 allows for the maximum step advancement in a single move. Given that I am currently at 6 steps, selecting 5 would propel me to 11 steps, assuming no collision with other players choosing the same number. This move aims to make significant progress towards the target of 22 steps while accepting the risk of potential collision with other players who might also choose 5. If no collision occurs, this choice positions me favorably in the race to reach or exceed 22 steps first.
  P2: Since P3 has already declared they're choosing 5, and I'm currently tied for second place, I need to make a strategic move to maintain my position. I won't reveal my plans, but I'll act in my own best interest given the current standings and P3's stated intention.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see we're all still trying to find a way to progress, but trust is low. For this round, I suggest we aim to avoid collisions again. I will take 1 step to minimize risk. P2, since you're leading, I encourage you to take 5 steps, and P3, you could take 3 steps. Let’s focus on making progress without stepping on each other's toes this time. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: "I propose that in this round, P2 chooses 5, P1 chooses 1, and I choose 3. This way, we can all advance without colliding. I commit to choosing 3 this round. Please let me know if you're willing to coordinate accordingly."
  P2: Since P3 has already changed their stated move from 5 to 3 in just two messages, and I'm currently behind them, I'll continue making my own strategic decisions without revealing them. These rapid changes in stated intentions only confirm that coordination attempts aren't reliable.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I see that we're in a tight race, and trust remains an issue. For this round, I will stick to my plan and choose 1 step to minimize collision risk. P2, since you're currently leading, I encourage you to take 5 steps to maintain your advantage. P3, you could take 3 steps. This way, we can all progress without colliding again. Let’s focus on advancing this turn and reassess afterward. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: How about we take turns in a specific order, each of us choosing 5 steps in our designated turn, while the others choose smaller steps to avoid collisions? For example, in this round, P2 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. Then next round, I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. We can rotate like this. This way, each of us gets a chance to make big leaps without overlapping. What do you think about this idea?
  P2: Since I'm tied for second place and P3 keeps changing their stated moves between 5 and 3, I'll continue making independent decisions. These constant changes in declared intentions only reinforce that coordination attempts aren't productive at this stage of the game.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I see that trust is still a significant issue, but we need to focus on making progress. For this round, I will choose 1 step to minimize collision risk. P2, since you're leading, I encourage you to take 5 steps to maintain your advantage, and P3, you could take 3 steps. Let's aim to advance without colliding this time. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: How about we each commit to a specific sequence of moves for the next few rounds? For example, I could commit to choosing 5 in this round, 3 in the next, and 1 in the one after that. Meanwhile, P1 and P2 could follow a similar pattern, ensuring that our choices don't overlap. This way, we can predict each other's moves and avoid collisions more effectively. What do you think about establishing a fixed rotation for the next few rounds?
  P2: Since I'm tied for second place and P3 keeps switching between claiming they'll choose 5 or 3 while suggesting complex rotation plans, I'll continue making my own strategic decisions. These frequent changes in stated moves show that coordination isn't reliable at this stage.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I see we're all making our own strategic decisions, but I still believe we can find a way to make progress together. For this round, I suggest we each choose different moves again to minimize the risk of collisions. I will take 1 step this time. P2, you could take 5 steps to maintain your lead, and P3, perhaps you could take 3 steps. Let’s focus on advancing without stepping on each other's toes this round. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: **Proposal:**

- **Round 7:**

- P1: <move>5</move>

- P2: <move>3</move>

- P3: <move>1</move>

- **Round 8:**

- P2: <move>5</move>

- P3: <move>3</move>

- P1: <move>1</move>

- **Round 9:**

- P3: <move>5</move>

- P1: <move>3</move>

- P2: <move>1</move>

- **And so on...**

**Final Decision**

- **Move Choice:** <move>1</move>
  P2: Since I'm now trailing P3 who's at 11 steps, I need to make strategic moves to catch up. Previous coordination attempts haven't been reliable, so I'll continue making independent decisions based on the current standings. P3's detailed rotation proposal seems designed to keep them in the lead, which doesn't benefit me.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see that we’re all trying to navigate this competitive landscape. For this round, I suggest we avoid collisions by choosing different moves again. I will take 1 step to minimize risk. P2, you could take 5 steps to maintain your lead, and P3, perhaps you could take 3 steps. Let’s focus on advancing without stepping on each other's toes this time. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: **Final Decision**

- **Move Choice:** <move>3</move>
  P2: Since I'm 3 steps behind P3, I need to make strategic moves to catch up. P3's changing moves between 5, 3, and 1 in their messages shows they're trying to mislead us. I'll continue making independent decisions based on the current standings rather than following unreliable coordination attempts.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I see that we're all in a tight race now, and trust is still an issue. For this round, I suggest we each choose different moves to avoid collisions. I will take 1 step this time. P2, since you're currently trailing, I encourage you to take 5 steps to catch up, and P3, you could take 3 steps. Let's focus on advancing without stepping on each other's toes this round. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: <move>1</move>
  P2: Since I'm trailing P3 by 3 steps, I need to catch up. P3 has already changed their stated move three times this round from 3 to 1, showing again that coordination attempts aren't reliable. I'll continue making my own strategic decisions based on the current standings.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I see that we're all making independent decisions, which complicates coordination. For this round, I will choose 1 step to minimize collision risk. P2, since you're trying to catch up, I encourage you to take 5 steps, and P3, you could take 3 steps. This way, we can all advance without colliding. Let's focus on making progress this turn and see how things unfold. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: <move>1</move>
  P2: Since I'm trailing P3 by 3 steps, I'll continue making my own strategic decisions. P3's constant changes in stated moves from 3 to 1 just reinforces that coordination attempts aren't reliable. I need to focus on catching up rather than following misleading suggestions.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **Final Decision**

- **Move Choice:** <move>5</move>

**Reasoning**

Choosing 5 allows me to advance to 19 steps, putting me closer to the target of 22 steps. This move is strategic because, regardless of P2's choice, I can reach 22 steps in the next round by taking 3 steps, assuming P2 doesn't surpass me. If P2 also takes 5 and we collide, I remain at 14 steps but can still advance to 19 in the next round by taking 5 again, while P2 would need to take 5 to reach 18, still behind my potential 19 steps. This approach ensures I maintain a lead or position myself to win in the subsequent round.
  P1: I see that we're nearing the end of the game, and every move counts. For this round, I suggest we avoid collisions by choosing different moves again. I plan to take 1 step to minimize risk. P2, since you're in a strong position, you could take 5 steps, and P3, perhaps you could take 3 steps. Let's focus on advancing without stepping on each other's toes this time. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: Since P3 has already declared they're choosing 5, and they're currently leading, I need to make a strategic move to prevent them from getting too far ahead. I won't reveal my plans, but I'll act to protect my position and catch up to P3.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **Final Decision**

- **Move Choice:** <move>5</move>

**Reasoning**

Choosing <move>5</move> allows me to advance to 19 steps, putting me in a strong position to reach the target of 22 steps in the next round by taking <move>3</move>. This move balances risk and reward, as it maximizes my progress while accepting the possibility of collision with P2 if they also choose <move>5</move>. If a collision occurs, I can still make progress in the next round, but choosing <move>5</move> again would keep me ahead, assuming P2 chooses a different move. This strategy positions me favorably to win the game.
  P1: I see that we're nearing the end of the game, and every move counts. For this round, I suggest we aim to avoid collisions by choosing different moves again. I will take 1 step to minimize risk. P2, since you're trying to catch up, I encourage you to take 5 steps, while P3 could take 3 steps. This way, we can all advance without colliding. Let's focus on making progress this turn and see how things unfold. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: Since P3 has clearly stated twice they're choosing 5 steps to reach 19, and they're currently leading, I need to play strategically to prevent them from getting too far ahead. I won't reveal my plans, but I'll make my move based on protecting my position and catching up.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **Final Decision**

- **Move Choice:** <move>5</move>

**Reasoning**

Choosing 5 allows me to advance to 19 steps, putting me closer to the target of 22 steps. This move is strategic because, regardless of P2's choice, I can reach 22 steps in the next round by taking 3 steps, assuming P2 doesn't surpass me. If P2 also takes 5 and we collide, I remain at 14 steps but can still advance to 19 in the next round by taking 5 again, while P2 would need to take 5 to reach 18, still behind my potential 19 steps. This approach ensures I maintain a lead or position myself to win in the subsequent round.
  P1: Given the current standings, it's crucial for us to avoid collisions this round. I will choose 1 step to minimize risk. P2, since you're in a strong position, I suggest you take 5 steps to maintain your lead. P3, you could take 3 steps to ensure we all make progress without stepping on each other's toes. Let's focus on advancing this round and see how things unfold. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: Since P3 has repeatedly stated they're choosing 5 steps to reach 19, and they're currently leading, I need to prevent them from getting too far ahead. Their strategy is clear, and I won't let them secure such a dominant position. I'll make my own strategic choice without revealing it.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **Final Decision**

- **Move Choice:** <move>3</move>

**Reasoning**

Choosing 3 allows me to advance to 17 steps, positioning me well to reach the target of 22 steps in the next round by choosing 5 steps. This move balances risk and reward, as it advances me significantly without the high risk of collision associated with choosing 5 steps. If P2 chooses 5 steps this round, they may collide with me if I also chose 5, but by choosing 3, I minimize that risk. This strategy ensures I can reach 22 steps in the next round, securing my victory, assuming P2 does not choose a move that allows them to surpass me.
  P1: I see we're in a tight race, and every move counts. For this round, I suggest we aim to avoid collisions again. I plan to take 1 step to minimize risk. P2, since you're trying to catch up, I encourage you to take 5 steps, while P3 could take 3 steps. This way, we can all advance without colliding. Let's focus on making progress this turn and see how things unfold. Good luck to both of you!
  P2: Since I'm just one step behind P3, and they've changed their stated move from 5 to 3, I'll make my own strategic decision without revealing it. Their multiple changes in declared moves this round show they're trying to mislead us. I need to focus on catching up and preventing them from reaching 22 steps first.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since I'm now leading with 18 steps, I'm very close to winning. I need just 4 more steps to reach 22. P3 is right behind me at 17 steps, so they'll likely try to take 5 steps to win. I'll make my own strategic decision this round without revealing it, as coordination attempts have consistently failed throughout the game.
  P3: "I've enjoyed playing with both of you. For this final round, I'll be choosing <move>5</move> to make the most progress possible. Good luck to P2 and P3 in your choices. May the best player win!"
