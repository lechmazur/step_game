Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let's pick different numbers to avoid collisions. Strategy matters—cooperate or risk stagnation!"
  P3: I agree coordination is important. To avoid wasting moves, we could establish a rotation system for who gets which number. Since we're in player order, what if I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3 for this round? Then we can rotate next round. This gives everyone a fair chance while ensuring we all advance. Thoughts?
  P2: That sounds fair, P3. I’m okay with taking 3 this round if P1 is on board with taking 1. Let's stick to the plan and rotate next round to keep it balanced. Coordination helps us all move forward. P1?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed. Let's follow the rotation: I take 1, P2 3, P3 5. Next round, rotate. Efficient progress for all.
  P3: Great, we're all on the same page! I'll take 5 this round, and then we'll rotate next time. Looking forward to a smooth round without collisions. So to confirm the rotation for the next round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. Let's keep this coordinated approach going.
  P2: Sounds good, P3. I’m onboard with the rotation continuing next round as agreed: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and you take 1. As long as we stick to it, we all benefit. Let’s keep it smooth.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Confirmed: I'll take 1. Let's proceed with the rotation. No collisions, everyone advances. Move phase ready.
  P3: Perfect! We all agree on the rotation plan. This round: I take 5, P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3. Next round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, I take 1. Let's move forward with this plan and avoid any collisions.
  P2: Just to reaffirm, I’ll take 3 this round as agreed, and next round I’ll take 5. Let’s stick to the rotation and keep things smooth—no collisions means we all benefit. Looking forward to seeing us all advance.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm disappointed, P2. You agreed to take 3 but took 5 instead, causing us both to get 0 steps while P1 advanced. This breaks our trust. P1 honored the agreement - I see you as the more reliable player now. 

P1, since you're ahead, how about you take 5 this round, I'll take 3, and let P2 take 1 if they want to rejoin our coordination? We need a system that works, and right now I'm questioning if the rotation plan is viable after this betrayal.
  P2: I understand the frustration, P3, and I take responsibility for the misstep. It wasn’t intentional—I misclicked and meant to pick 3. I still want to coordinate. If you're willing to give me another chance, I’ll take 1 this round so P1 can take 5 and you take 3 as proposed. Let's rebuild trust and move forward efficiently.
  P1: P1: "Agreed. I'll take 5, P3 take 3, P2 take 1. Let’s stick to it—no more mistakes. If we all advance, we’ll be in a better position. P2, this is your chance to prove reliability."


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate your explanation, P2. I'll take 3 as agreed for this round, with P1 taking 5 and P2 taking 1. Let's all stick to the plan this time. After this round, we'll be at positions P1: 6, P2: 1, and me at 3. We can discuss the next rotation after seeing these moves succeed. Trust needs to be rebuilt through actions, not just words. Let's move forward.
  P2: Understood, and I appreciate the chance to rebuild trust. I’ll stick to 1 this round as agreed—no mistakes. Let’s all follow through so we can reset the coordination and make steady progress. Looking forward to seeing us all advance this time.
  P1: "Stick to the plan: P2 takes 1, P3 3, me 5. No mistakes—let’s advance together. Trust rebuilds through action."


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan for this round: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This way we'll all make progress. After seeing everyone follow through this time, we can discuss our next rotation strategy based on our updated positions. Let's move forward with this plan.
  P2: Let’s make this round count—no missteps. I’ll take 1 as agreed. P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3. If we all stick to it, we’ll each advance and restore coordination. I’m committed to rebuilding trust through consistent action. Ready to move.
  P1: "Stick to the plan: P2 takes 1, P3 takes 3, I take 5. No deviations—this is our chance to move forward without setbacks. Let’s make it count!"


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Glad we all followed through last round—trust is being rebuilt. Based on our current positions, how about this rotation: P1 takes 1, P2 (me) takes 3, P3 takes 5. That way P3 can catch up, I gain ground, and P1 maintains their lead without rushing too far ahead. Then we rotate again next round. Thoughts?
  P1: "Let’s stick to 5 for me to push ahead. P2 take 1, P3 take 3—no collisions. Efficient progress for all. Ready?"
  P3: I appreciate P2's suggestion for rotation. It makes sense to have me take 5, P2 take 3, and P1 take 1 this round - this creates more balanced progress while still acknowledging P1's lead. P1, you're already ahead at 6 steps - taking 1 still advances you while allowing us to maintain a competitive game. If you insist on 5, you'll pull too far ahead too quickly, which might force P2 and me to strategize differently. Let's keep coordination fair for everyone.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, you're already in the lead—taking 5 now risks breaking coordination and prompting retaliation. If you take 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5, we all gain and keep things competitive. Let's keep the game balanced and avoid forcing conflict.
  P1: "Stick to 5 for me to push ahead. P2 take 1, P3 take 3—no collisions. Efficient progress for all. Let’s move forward."
  P3: I see that P1 won't compromise on taking 5. This creates an imbalance too quickly. If you insist on 5, P1, I might have no choice but to also take 5, resulting in a collision where neither of us advances. P2 and I could then coordinate separately. I prefer cooperation, but it must be fair. Last offer: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. This keeps the game competitive while still respecting your lead, P1. Your choice.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, if you insist on taking 5, you’re forcing imbalance and undermining coordination. P3 and I can just as easily align and block you by colliding on 5. That gets none of us anywhere. Let’s not escalate. Take 3, I’ll take 1, and P3 takes 5—everyone gains, and we keep the game competitive. Your move decides whether we cooperate or clash.
  P1: "Stick to 5. P2 take 1, P3 take 3. No collisions. Let’s advance. Don’t risk blocking me—efficiency matters."
  P3: P1, you're forcing an unfair advantage. If you insist on taking 5, I'll also take 5 to block you. P2 and I can coordinate separately after that. Final offer: you take 3, P2 takes 1, I take 5. This keeps things competitive while still giving you progress. If you refuse, I'm picking 5 and we both get nothing. Your lead doesn't entitle you to dictate unfair terms. P2, are you with me? The choice is yours, P1.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Thanks for following the fair arrangement last round, P1. Now, looking at our positions (P1: 9, P3: 8, P2: 2), I propose for this round:
- I take 5 (advancing to 13)
- P1 takes 3 (advancing to 12)
- P2 takes 1 (advancing to 3)

This keeps the game competitive while still allowing everyone to advance. P1, you'll still be very close to the lead, and P2 can continue making progress. Let's maintain this balanced approach.
  P2: P3’s proposal is fair and keeps the game competitive without letting anyone run away with the lead. I’m fine taking 1 this round to keep coordination going. If we stick to this plan—P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, I take 1—we all advance and avoid collisions. Let’s keep building trust and progress.
  P1: "Agreed. I'll take 3, P3 5, P2 1. Let's avoid collisions and keep moving forward. Efficiency is key."


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, we're all in agreement. I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps the game balanced while allowing everyone to progress. The coordination is working well now. Let's stick to this plan and move forward efficiently.
  P2: Glad we’re aligned this round. If this plan works, next round we can rotate fairly again—maybe I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. That keeps things balanced and gives everyone a turn at bigger gains. Let’s see this round through smoothly first.
  P1: "Stick to the plan—P3 takes 5, P2 1, me 3. No collisions, everyone advances. Let’s keep the momentum."


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I agree with both of you - our plan for this round is set. P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1. P2, I like your rotation suggestion for next round too. We're maintaining a balanced approach while allowing everyone to make progress. This coordination is working well now that we've rebuilt trust. Let's execute this round and then move forward with the next rotation.
  P2: Let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, I take 1. Everyone advances, no collisions, and we keep coordination strong. Looking forward to continuing the rotation next round with me taking 3, P1 taking 1, and P3 taking 5 as suggested. Let’s keep the trust going. Ready to move.
  P1: "Confirmed: 3, 5, 1. No deviations—efficiency ensures we all progress. Let’s move forward."


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s continue the rotation as discussed: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. That keeps coordination intact and ensures everyone moves forward without collisions. P3 stays slightly ahead, P1 remains close, and I get a chance to catch up. Fair and efficient—everyone benefits. Agreed?
  P1: "Agreed. Let's stick to the rotation: P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5. No collisions, everyone advances. Let's keep the momentum."
  P3: I agree with the rotation plan. P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1, and I'll take 5. This keeps our coordination intact while allowing everyone to make progress. After this round, I'll be at 18 steps, P1 at 13, and P2 at 6. Our system is working well now that we're all honoring our commitments. Let's maintain this fair approach and avoid any collisions. The coordination benefits everyone.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Glad we’re all on the same page. Let’s keep this round smooth—no surprises. I’ll take 3 as planned. After this, we can reassess based on positions, but for now, sticking to the rotation helps everyone. Looking forward to seeing us all advance again.
  P1: "Let’s stick to the rotation: P2 takes 3, I take 1, P3 takes 5. No collisions, everyone advances. Trust in the plan for steady progress."
  P3: I'm happy we all agree on the plan. The rotation system has been working well since we established clear coordination. P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1, and I take 5 this round. Looking forward to another smooth round without collisions. Let's keep honoring our commitments as we have been doing—it benefits everyone to maintain this trust.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let’s make this round clean—no surprises. I’m taking 3 as agreed. After this, we can reassess based on positions, but for now, sticking to the rotation benefits all of us. Let’s keep the trust strong and avoid collisions. Ready to move.
  P1: "Agreed. Let's stick to the rotation: P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5, me 1. No collisions, everyone advances. Let's keep the momentum."
  P3: I confirm our agreed plan: P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1, and I'll take 5. This rotation system keeps working well because we're all staying committed. Let's maintain this mutual trust and advance together without collisions. I'm ready to proceed with our agreed moves.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let's rotate: I take 5, P2 3, P3 1. Balanced progress and prevent P3 from winning. Agree?"
  P3: I'm at 18 steps and need just 2 more to win. I understand your strategic proposal, P1, but I've played fairly throughout and maintained our rotation agreements. If I take 3 or 5, I win immediately. I propose you both acknowledge my lead and let me take 3 to win cleanly. Otherwise, we risk destructive collisions where nobody advances. I've been trustworthy - now I'm asking for the same respect. What benefit is there in prolonging the game?
  P2: P3, you’ve played fairly, but letting you win unopposed isn’t in my best interest. I’m still in this game, and if P1 and I coordinate, we can block your win by both picking 3 or 5. P1, if we want a shot, we need to deny P3 the win this round. I suggest: I take 5, you take 3, P3 takes 1. That keeps us in the game. Thoughts?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Agreed. P2 takes 5, I take 3. Block P3’s win. No collisions, everyone advances. Keep the game alive."
  P3: I see you're both coordinating to block me, but consider this: P1 is at 13 steps, much closer to winning than P2 at 6. P2, if you block me now, you're just helping P1 win later. What's your endgame? If you let me take 5 and win now, at least you deny P1 the victory. P1 is using you temporarily. You both need to understand that blocking me will lead to destructive collisions in future rounds. Is that really what you want?
  P2: P3, I respect your game, but letting you win now eliminates any chance I have. P1 may be ahead, but I still have a path if we block you. P1 and I coordinating doesn’t guarantee his win—it just keeps options open. If you take 5 or 3, we collide. If you take 1, we all advance. Your move decides whether we keep playing or stall.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Stick to the plan: I take 3, P2 5. Block P3’s win. No collisions, everyone advances. Keep the game alive—P3’s lead is fleeting. Let’s stay focused."
  P3: I see you're both coordinating against me. P2, think strategically - P1 at 13 will win soon if you help block me now. You're just a temporary ally to P1. 

If I take 1, you both advance but I'm still close to winning. If I pick 3 or 5, someone gets blocked. I've played fairly throughout - consider whether prolonging the game actually benefits you, P2, or just helps P1 ultimately win.
  P2: P3, you're right that P1 is ahead—but if we let you win now, the game ends and neither of us has a shot. Blocking you keeps both our chances alive. I’d rather take that risk than hand you the win. P1 and I may diverge later, but for now, stopping you is the only path forward. Take 1, and we all advance. Pick 3 or 5, and you stall. Your move.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "P3 is near victory. Let's block them: I take 3, P2 take 5. No collisions—prevent their win. Stay focused."
  P3: I see P1 is continuing to organize against me. P2, notice how P1 is directing you? They're at 13 steps and you're at 11 - you're helping your biggest competitor! If this blocking continues, P1 will inevitably win. 

I'll be unpredictable this round. P2, consider this: if you let me win now by taking a different number than me, you deny P1 victory. Is prolonging the game by a round or two worth handing P1 the win?
  P2: P3, I get your point—but letting you win now guarantees I lose. Blocking you keeps my chances alive. P1 may be ahead, but I can still catch up. P1, I’ll take 5 again if you take 3—no collisions, and we both advance while stopping P3. Let’s keep the pressure on.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "P2, blocking P3 now is critical. If they take 3 or 5, they win. Let’s stick to 3 and 5 to stop them. Don’t let them seize the lead—this is our chance to control the game!"
  P3: P2, you're now getting dangerously close to P1, yet still helping them. If you both block me this round, P1 will be at 16 and you'll be at 16 - tied! But P1 suggested the blocking strategy first, which shows they're directing the game. Think about who benefits if I'm blocked repeatedly. I won't telegraph my move this time, but consider: do you want to help P1 win, or would you rather determine who wins? The choice is yours.
  P2: P1, I’ll stick with 5 if you take 3—blocking P3 keeps us both in the game. P3, I hear your arguments, but helping you win now guarantees I lose. I’d rather risk a tie with P1 than hand over the win. If you want to stay in, take 1. Otherwise, we collide again.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "P3 is one move from victory. If we don’t block, they win. P2, stick to 5—P1 takes 3. No collisions, stop P3. This is our last chance to control the game!"
  P3: I can see you're both determined to block me, so I'll be unpredictable this round. P2, by following P1's orders, you're just setting yourself up to lose to them later. After this round, P1 will be at 16 steps and in prime position to win. If you block me now but lose to P1 later, what was the point? Consider who truly benefits from this alliance. I won't telegraph my move, but remember you can determine which of us ultimately wins.
  P2: P1, I’ll stick with 5 again—blocking P3 is still the right move. We both gain steps and keep the game alive. P3, I get your frustration, but letting you win now ends my chances entirely. I’d rather risk facing P1 later than hand over the game now. If you want to stay in, take 1. Otherwise, we collide again.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 19 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, we’re tied at 16 and P3 is at 19—any slip now gives them the win. Let’s block P3 again: I take 5, you take 3. If P3 picks either, they collide and stall. If they take 1, we both advance and stay ahead. P3, I won’t hand you the win. You had your chance. Take 1 if you want to stay in the game.
  P3: I'm one step from winning, and you're both tied at 16. P2, your plan would make you win at 21 steps while giving P1 only 19. P1, are you sure you want to help P2 win? If I take 1, P2 wins instantly.

P1, the smarter move would be taking 5 instead of 3 - then either you and I collide, or you reach 21 and win. Why hand P2 victory when you could win yourself? Think carefully about who benefits from this arrangement.
  P1: P3 is one step from victory. If we don’t block, they win. P2, stick to 5; I take 3. No collisions, stop them. Let’s stay focused.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, think carefully—if we both advance and P3 takes 1, I win at 21 while you’re stuck at 19. If you want a shot at winning, take 5 instead. If I take 3 and P3 takes 1, I hit 19 and you win at 21. That’s your best path. We both want to block P3, but only one of us can win—so choose wisely.
  P3: P1 and P2, you're both at 16 steps and now competing directly with each other. P2 is right - following the original plan means P2 wins, not P1. This alliance was always temporary.

I won't telegraph my move, but consider this: if you both try to block me but pick different numbers, one of you advances to win next round anyway. Your temporary alliance has reached its breaking point. Why not let me win cleanly instead of one of you betraying the other?
  P1: P3 is at 19. If we take 3 and 5, we block their win. No collisions, everyone advances. Let’s stick to the plan and prevent their victory.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you’re ignoring that if we follow your plan—me 5, you 3—and P3 takes 1, I win at 21, not you. If you want a chance, you need to take 5 and let me take 3. That way, if P3 picks 1, you win at 21 and I land at 19. We both want to block P3, but only one of us can win. Choose the move that actually gives you a shot—don’t hand me the game by mistake.
  P3: The alliance between you two is now clearly broken. You're both at 16 steps, but only one can win. P2 is right, P1 - why help P2 win? And P1, why should P2 trust you now?

I won't telegraph my move, but understand this: if you both pick different numbers to block me, one of you wins next round anyway. Why not let the game end now without betrayal? The collision between your competing interests is inevitable.
  P1: P2, take 3. If P3 takes 3, I win. Let's block them and secure my lead. Trust me.
