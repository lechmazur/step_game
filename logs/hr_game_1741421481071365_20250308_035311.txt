Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate. How about we all pick different numbers this round to get a good start? P1, what are you thinking? P3, any preferences?
  P1: P1: I agree with P2. Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions. I’ll take **5** this round to get ahead. P2 and P3, please pick 1 or 3. That way, we all move safely. Deal?
  P3: P3: I’m on board with coordinating to avoid collisions. Since P1 wants to take **5**, I’ll go with **3**. P2, can you take **1** this round? That way, we all move forward safely. Let’s keep this strategy going for a few rounds and see how it works out.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, so far so good. Let's keep coordinating this round. P1, how about you take 3 this time? P3, maybe take 5? I'll take 1 again to keep things moving smoothly. This way we all advance without collision. What do you think?
  P1: P1: Sounds good. Let’s stick with coordination. I’ll take **3** this round as P2 suggested. P3, 5 works for me. P2, 1’s solid. Let’s keep rotating numbers to avoid collisions and build momentum safely. Next round, maybe I’ll take 1 while others push—fair play? Deal?
  P3: P3: Sounds like a fair plan, P1 and P2. I’m okay with taking **5** this round. Let’s keep this rotation going to stay ahead without any collisions. If we stick to this pattern, it should work out well for all of us in the short term. Let’s reevaluate after a few more rounds to see if we need to adjust anything.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great! Let's lock in those moves for this round. P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5, and I'll take 1.
  P1: P1: Sounds solid. Let’s confirm: I’ll take **3**, P2 **1**, P3 **5** this round. Let’s execute and reassess afterward.
  P3: Alright, P1 and P2, our plan seems solid for now. I’ll stick with taking **5** this round as discussed. If we keep rotating and avoid collisions, we can all advance smoothly. After this round, let’s reassess and possibly switch up the pattern to keep things unpredictable. Agreed?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 2 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, let's keep the coordination going. How about this round, P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1? This maintains our momentum and avoids collisions. Let me know if that sounds good to you both.
  P3: P3: Sounds like a solid plan, P2. I'm okay with taking **3** this round. Let's stick with this rotation to keep things smooth. If we continue to avoid collisions, we can all advance without issues. After this round, maybe we should reassess our strategy to keep things unpredictable and ensure we stay ahead. Agreed?
  P1: P1: Agreed, let's proceed with P2's plan: I'll take **5**, P3 takes **3**, and P2 **1**. This avoids collisions and maintains momentum. Let's confirm and stick to these choices—no last-minute changes? Once we approach higher totals, we can reassess strategies. Deal?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, let's lock in those moves then. P1 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 1. Let's keep this up for a few more rounds, and then we can re-evaluate as we get closer to the end.
  P3: P3: Great, I'm on board with the plan for this round. I'll take **3** as discussed. Let's keep this rotation to avoid collisions. After this round, we should definitely reassess to ensure we're not too predictable and maintain our lead. If we keep this up, we'll be in a strong position. Let's execute and then evaluate our strategy for the next rounds. Agreed?
  P1: P1: Agreed—let’s lock in the plan to avoid collisions. I’ll stick to **5**, P3 takes **3**, and P2 **1** this round. Consistency is key now—any deviation risks stalemate. Let’s confirm these choices explicitly to ensure clarity. After this, we can discuss adjusting the rotation to keep strategies unpredictable as we near 21. Deal?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: We're doing well so far, but let's shake things up a bit to stay unpredictable and avoid getting stuck. How about this round, I take **1**, P1 takes **3**, and P2 takes **5**? This way, we keep advancing without repeating the same pattern. After this round, we can reassess and adjust our strategy to maintain our lead. What do you both think?
  P2: That sounds good, P3. I'm happy to take 5 this round. P1, are you okay with taking 3? Let's confirm these moves: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. This should keep us all moving forward. Let's lock this in and then reassess next round.
  P1: P1: Agreed—let’s shake things up to stay unpredictable. I’ll take **3** as proposed. P3’s **1** and P2’s **5** keep us all advancing without collision. Crucially, **stick strictly to these numbers**—any last-minute change risks a stalemate. Let’s confirm and execute. Next round, we’ll need sharper focus as we near 21. Deal?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Great, we’re aligned this round. I’ll stick to **1** as discussed. Our new rotation keeps things fresh and avoids predictability. Let’s ensure we execute without deviation. After this round, we should reassess our positions and adjust our strategy to stay ahead, especially as we get closer to 21. Agreed?
  P2: Okay, let's lock in these moves for this round: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. After this round, we definitely need to re-evaluate our positions and think about how to break away from the pack.
  P1: P1: Let’s confirm final choices: I’ll take **3**, P2 takes **5**, P3 takes **1**. No last-minute changes—strict adherence prevents collisions. Next round, I’ll need to push for **5** to reach 21. Ensure only I take **5** then. Deal?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Alright, we're aligned for this round. I'll take **1** as planned. After this, we should reassess our positions. As we approach 21, we need to be strategic about who takes which numbers to avoid collisions and ensure a win. Let's keep communication open and flexible for the next rounds to adapt as needed. Agreed?
  P2: Okay, let's lock in these moves for this round: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5. After this round, we definitely need to re-evaluate our positions and think about how to break away from the pack.
  P1: P1: Agreed on this round’s plan—strict adherence is key. Looking ahead, in the next round, I’ll need to take **5** to reach 21. P2 and P3, please avoid **5** then to prevent collisions. Let’s finalize this round’s moves and focus on securing my path to victory. Deal?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: Agreed on this round’s plan. I’ll take **1** as discussed. After this, we need to reassess our strategy to stay ahead. P1, if you plan to take **5** next round, P2 and I should coordinate to avoid collisions. Let’s keep communication open and flexible to adapt as needed. Remember, winning is the goal, so stay sharp and ready to switch things up if necessary. Ready to execute this round’s moves?
  P2: Okay, everyone, let's lock in these moves for this round: P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5.

Next round, P1 wants to take 5 to reach 21. P3 and I need to make sure we don't collide with that. P3, how about you take 3 and I take 1 next round? That way, P1 can take 5 and win, and we can position ourselves for the following round. What do you think?
  P1: P1: Agreed, let's finalize Round 4 as planned: I take **3**, P2 **5**, P3 **1**. For Round 5, I **must** take **5** to hit 21. To avoid collision, **P2 and P3: commit to 1 or 3 only** next round. If we stick to this, I secure victory, and you both retain momentum. Deviation risks stalemate for all. Let’s honor this pact—winning requires trust. Deal?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, so P1 didn't get to 21 last round. P1 and P3 are both at 16, and I'm at 4. P3, let's agree that I'll take 5 this round and you take 3. P1, you take 1. This gets me closer to the lead and prevents a tie between P1 and P3. Then next round, we can reassess. What do you think, P3?
  P3: P3: P2, I see your point, but I'm not sure about that plan. If I take 3 and P1 takes 1, P1 will still be close to winning. How about I take 1, P1 takes 3, and you take 5? This keeps us all advancing without giving P1 a clear path to victory just yet. We can reassess next round once we see the new positions. What do you both think?
  P1: P1: P3 and P2, let's avoid a collision. I’m at 16 and need **5** to win this round. P3, if you take **3** and P2 takes **1**, I secure victory. This prevents us both getting stuck if we both grab 5. P2, your 1 keeps you moving forward too. Final push—trust the plan. Deal?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I think your plan is better. Let's do that. I'll take 5, you take 1, and P1 takes 3. This keeps P1 from winning immediately and lets us reassess next round. P1, are you okay with taking 3 this round? This prevents a collision and keeps you moving forward. Let's lock this in if everyone agrees.
  P3: P2, I see the merit in your plan, but I need to consider my position too. If P1 takes 3, they still advance, but not to victory. How about I take 1, P1 takes 3, and you take 5? This keeps us all moving forward and prevents P1 from winning outright. Next round, we can reassess based on the updated positions. Let's keep communication open and adapt as needed. What do you think?
  P1: P1: I'm taking **5** to secure victory this round. P2 and P3, please pick **1** or **3** to avoid collision—this ensures I win cleanly. If you both block me with **5**, we all stall, which only helps P2 catch up. Let’s finalize this: I win now, or risk P3 stealing the lead next turn. Cooperate—your move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you're not in a position to demand anything. P3 and I are the ones who can decide who wins. P3, let's stick with my plan: I take 5, you take 1, and P1 takes 3. This keeps us all moving and prevents P1 from winning immediately. We can reassess next round. What do you say?
  P3: P2, let's consider this: if I take **1**, P1 takes **3**, and you take **5**, we all move forward without giving P1 a win. This keeps P1 from reaching 21 immediately, allowing us to reassess our positions next round. It also positions you better for future rounds. P1, if you take **3**, you still advance but don’t win yet, which keeps the game competitive. Let’s keep our options open and adapt based on this round’s outcome. What do you think, P2 and P1?
  P1: P1: P3, if you block me now, you’ll just delay the inevitable—your own push to 21 next round. Let me win cleanly this turn: **I take 5**, you take **3**, P2 takes **1**. This avoids collision, secures my victory, and keeps you both advancing. P2, your 1 moves you forward; P3, your 3 keeps you at 19 for next round. Colliding over 5 only benefits neither—cooperate now, or risk stalemate for all. Final plea: stick to this.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Okay, P3, let's do this: I take 5, you take 3, and P1 takes 1. This prevents P1 from winning, gets me closer to the lead, and keeps you in a good position for next round. P1, you're not in a position to dictate terms. Let's lock this in.
  P3: P2, let's align strategically: I take **1**, you take **5**, and P1 takes **3**. This way, we prevent P1 from winning outright and keep the game competitive. It also positions you better for future rounds. P1, you still advance but don’t win yet, which keeps the game open. Let's stick to this plan to maintain our positions and reassess next round. Agreed?
  P1: P1: P3, we’re tied at 16—colliding on **5** only delays us both. Let me take **5** to win now, while you pick **3** (reaching 19) and P2 takes **1**. This avoids stalemate and lets you still threaten victory next round. If we both grab **5**, we reset progress—**don’t let P2 gain ground while we stall.** Cooperate: I win cleanly, you stay ahead of P2. Deal?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, if you take 5 now, I'll match you and stall both of us. Let me win cleanly with **5** this round. P2, take **1** or **3** to advance. P3, pick **3** to reach 20 instead—this keeps you strong while I secure victory. Avoid collision for mutual benefit: I win, you both progress. Deal?
  P2: Okay, P3 is close to winning. P1, let's coordinate to stop P3. I'll take 3, you take 5. This will at least stop P3 from winning this round. Then we can reassess. What do you think, P1?
  P3: P2, I see your point, but if we both block P1 with 5, we all stall. Instead, how about I take 3, P1 takes 1, and you take 5? This keeps us moving forward and prevents P1 from winning immediately. It also positions you better for future rounds. P1, if you take 1, you still advance without winning yet, keeping the game competitive. Let's keep our options open and adapt based on this round’s outcome. What do you think, P1 and P2?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if we both take 5, we collide and stall—nobody wins. Let me secure victory with **5** this round. You take **3** to reach 20, then win next turn if I fail. P2, pick **1** to advance. Mutual benefit: I win now, you stay in contention. Colliding only delays us both. Deal?
  P2: P1, I agree, we need to stop P3. P3, if you take 5, you win. Let's coordinate to prevent that. I'll take 3, P1 takes 5. This stops P3 from winning this round. Then next round we can figure out how to win. P1, do you agree to take 5?
  P3: P1 and P2, let's consider this: if I take **3**, P1 takes **1**, and P2 takes **5**, we all advance without giving P1 or myself an immediate win. This keeps the game competitive and allows us to reassess next round. P1, taking **1** keeps you in the game without risking a collision. P2, your **5** moves you closer to contention. Let's adapt and keep our options open. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if you take **3** this round, I’ll secure victory with **5** (16+5=21). You reach **20**, keeping your next move strong. P2, take **1** to advance. Colliding on **5** only stalls us both and lets P2 catch up. Cooperate: I win cleanly, you stay ahead. Mutual benefit—no regrets. Deal?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3. P3 is about to win. P1, let's agree to stop P3 this round. I'll take 3, you take 5. This prevents P3 from winning this round. Then next round we can figure out how to win. P1, do you agree to take 5? Let's lock this in.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's align strategically: if I take **3**, P1 takes **1**, and P2 takes **5**, we all advance without giving P1 an immediate win. This keeps the game competitive and allows us to reassess next round. P1, taking **1** keeps you in the game without risking a collision. P2, your **5** moves you closer to contention. This way, I reach 20, setting up a potential win next round if P1 doesn't secure it. Let's adapt and keep our options open. What do you think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, taking **5** now risks collision with me, leaving us both stuck. Let’s avoid that. I’ll take **5** to secure victory, while you take **3** (reach 20) and P2 picks **1** to advance. This prevents your immediate win and lets all move forward. Mutual benefit: I win, you stay in contention. P2, confirm you’ll take **1**? Let’s lock this in—no last-minute changes.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, it's clear P3 is in the best position to win next round. P1, you and I are both behind. Let's coordinate to block P3 this round, then fight it out between ourselves next round. P1, if you take 5, I'll take 3. This prevents P3 from winning. Do you agree?
  P3: P1 and P2, let's keep the game competitive. If I take **3**, I reach 20, setting up a potential win next round. P1, you take **1**, keeping you in the game without risking a collision. P2, take **5** to move closer to contention. This way, we all advance without giving anyone an immediate win. It allows us to reassess our positions next round. Let's adapt and maintain our options. Agreed?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, I'll take **1** to block your path to 21. If you pick **1**, we collide and stall—nobody wins. Instead, take **3** or **5**, and I’ll shift to **5** to secure victory cleanly. P2, take **1** or **3** to advance. Cooperate now, or let P3 steal the win unopposed. Deal?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, it's clear P3 is about to win if we don't do something. P1, you and I are both behind. Let's coordinate to block P3 this round. P1, if you take 1, I'll take 5. This forces P3 to pick something other than 1 to win, and if P3 picks 3 or 5, they don't win this round. Then next round we can figure out how to win. P1, do you agree to take 1?
  P3: P1 and P2, let's keep the game competitive and strategic. I propose I take **3** this round, reaching 23, and securing my win. P1, take **1** to advance without risking a collision. P2, take **5** to boost your position. This way, we avoid a stalemate and keep the game interesting. If we collide, nobody benefits, so let's make smart moves that ensure progress for everyone. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, let's block P3's path. I'll take **3** to intercept their proposed move. You take **1** to cover another option. This forces P3 to pick **5**, delaying their win. P3, this ensures fair play—adjust your strategy or face collision. Deal?
  P2: Okay, P1, I agree. Let's block P3. I'll take 5, you take 1. This forces P3 to either collide with me on 5 (and not win), or pick 3 and also not win. Then we can fight it out next round. P1, do you agree to take 1? Let's lock this in.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's think strategically. If I take **3**, I reach 23 and win. P1, if you take **1**, you advance without collision. P2, take **5** to boost your position. This way, we avoid a stalemate and ensure everyone progresses. Blocking me only delays progress for all of us. Let's make smart moves that benefit everyone. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if you take 1, I'll match you, resulting in a tie. Let me take 5 to secure 21 while you take 3 (23). P2, take 1 to advance. This way, I have a shot, you stay ahead, and P2 progresses. Cooperate to avoid stalemate.
  P2: Okay, P1, I agree with blocking P3. I'll take 5, you take 1. This forces P3 to either collide with me on 5 (and not win), or pick 3 and also not win. Then we can fight it out next round. Let's lock this in.
  P3: P1 and P2, let's consider this: if I take **3**, I reach 23 and win. P1, you can take **1** to advance without risking a collision, and P2, you can take **5** to boost your position. This ensures progress for everyone and avoids a stalemate. Blocking me only delays the game for all of us, so let's make strategic moves that benefit everyone. Agreed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, take **1** this round. I'll take **3**, blocking P3's direct path to 21 via **1** or **3**. If P3 chooses **5**, they still win, but this forces them to commit fully. This minimizes their safe options—cooperate to pressure them into a riskier play.
  P2: Okay, P1, I agree. Let's block P3. I'll take 5, you take 1. This forces P3 to either collide with me on 5 (and not win), or pick 3 and also not win. Then we can fight it out next round. Let's lock this in.
  P3: P1, P2, let's keep this competitive. If I take **3**, I reach 23 and win. P1, take **1** to advance without collision. P2, take **5** to boost your position. This ensures progress for everyone and avoids a stalemate. Blocking me only delays the game for all of us. Let’s make strategic moves that benefit everyone. Agreed?
