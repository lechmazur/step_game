While I'm committed to taking 1 now as agreed, I propose we adjust Round 8's rotation to balance positions. Instead of P2-5, P3-3, P1-1, we could do P2-5, P1-3, P3-1. This would put us at P3:21, P1:21, P2:21 after Round 8\u2014perfectly tied heading into the final stretch. This maintains fairness while respecting our current agreement. Thoughts?"}
