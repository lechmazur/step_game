Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hello P1 and P3! To ensure we all advance smoothly, let's try to choose different steps each turn. I'll go with **3** this round. Looking forward to a great game!
  P1: To avoid collision in the first round, I'll suggest a strategy. Let's choose different numbers, as P2 mentioned. Since P2 is going with 3, I'll choose 1, and P3 can take 5. This way, we all advance. P3, please confirm if you're going with 5. If so, I'll make my move accordingly in the next phase. If not, we need to adjust. Let's coordinate our moves.
  P3: Sounds good to me. I'll take 5 this round as suggested. Let's all stick to the plan so we can avoid collisions and move forward together.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, we're all set: I’ll choose **3** this round. P1 with **1** and P3 with **5**. Let’s proceed smoothly. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Since we've coordinated our moves for this round (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5), let's confirm that we're sticking to the plan. If everyone follows through, we'll all advance. For the next round, we should discuss a strategy to avoid collisions again. Perhaps we can rotate our numbers or establish a pattern. What are your thoughts, P2 and P3? Should we plan ahead for the next round or react based on the outcome of this one?
  P3: I agree that planning ahead could help us all avoid collisions. Rotating numbers might work—something like P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1 next round? Then we keep rotating. Let's see how this round plays out first, then confirm the rotation. Sound good?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Perfect, let's stick to our plan and move forward.
  P1: Since we've agreed on the moves for this round (P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5), let's focus on the next round. I like P3's rotation idea: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 next round. To confirm, P2, are you okay with rotating our numbers as P3 suggested? If so, we can stick to the plan after this round. Let's finalize our strategy for Round 2.
  P3: Yes, I’m fully on board with the rotation plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 1 in Round 2. If we all stick to it, we can keep progressing without collisions. Let’s keep the cooperation going for now.


Round 1, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Glad we all advanced cleanly in Round 1. Let's stick to the rotation plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 1 this round. If we all follow through, we can continue progressing without collisions. Sound good?
  P1: Let's proceed with the rotation plan for Round 2: I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. P2, please confirm if you're comfortable with taking 5 this round. If we're all on the same page, we can avoid collisions again. For Round 3, we can continue the rotation: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, we maintain our progress. Let's finalize our moves for this round.
  P2: P2: Confirming I'll take **5** this round as per our rotation plan. Let's stick to it to progress smoothly and avoid any collisions. Looking forward to advancing together!


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, we’re all aligned for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 1. For Round 3, as P1 suggested, let’s rotate again: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll take 3. If we stick to this pattern, we’ll all keep moving forward without collisions. Let’s keep it up!
  P1: Since we've confirmed our moves for Round 2 (P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1), let's look ahead to Round 3. As previously discussed, the rotation plan for Round 3 is P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3. P2, please confirm you're okay with taking 1 in Round 3. If so, we're set. If not, we need to adjust. Let's finalize our plan for Round 3 to avoid collisions.
  P2: Understood, I'll take **1** in Round 3 as planned. Let's stick to our rotation to ensure smooth progress for all of us. Looking forward to continuing our coordinated efforts!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Thanks for confirming, P2. We’re all set for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I’ll take 1. Next round, we rotate again—P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3. If we all stick to the pattern, we’ll keep moving forward without collisions. Let’s keep the momentum going.
  P1: Let's proceed with the planned moves for Round 2 and look ahead. We've confirmed P1: 3, P2: 5, P3: 1 for this round. For Round 3, the plan is P1: 5, P2: 1, P3: 3. To ensure we're all on the same page, let's confirm our understanding: we'll stick to the rotation plan until someone wins. If a player deviates, we should adjust accordingly. Let's finalize our moves for Round 2 and be ready to execute the next rotation in Round 3.
  P2: I've decided to choose **5** this round to gain a stronger lead. Let's see how it plays out. Good luck!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Looks like Round 2 didn’t go as planned—P1 and I collided on 3. P2, you stuck with 5 and pulled ahead. If we want to keep progressing, we need to reestablish trust. I propose we reset the rotation: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5 this round. If we stick to it, we can all advance. Thoughts?
  P1: To avoid collisions in Round 3, I agree with P3's proposal to reset the rotation. Let's proceed with P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5. P2, please confirm if you're okay with taking 3 this round. If we stick to this plan, we can all advance. For future rounds, we should continue to adjust our strategy to avoid collisions and ensure smooth progress. Let's finalize our move for this round and be ready to adapt if needed.
  P2: I’ve decided to choose **5** this round to make significant progress. Let’s move forward and see how it goes!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, you’re clearly breaking from the coordination plan again to surge ahead. If you keep doing this, P1 and I have every reason to block your moves. P1, I suggest we both pick 5 this round—if P2 insists on 5 again, she gets blocked. Let’s show that betrayal has consequences. P1, are you in?
  P1: P3 suggests we both pick 5 to block P2 if she chooses 5 again. I'm inclined to do so, as P2 has already broken the coordination plan twice. However, I want to gauge P3's commitment. P3, are you serious about picking 5 this round, and will you stick to it even if P2 changes her move? Let's coordinate our actions to counter P2's aggressive strategy.
  P2: I understand your concerns, but my focus remains on winning. I'll choose **5** this round. Let’s see how things play out.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2 has made it clear she’s going for 5 again. If we both pick 5, we block her and prevent her from running away with the lead. It’s now or never to slow her down. I’m locking in 5—join me so we both benefit by stopping her momentum.
  P1: P3 and I have discussed countering P2's aggressive strategy by both picking 5. I'm committed to this plan. If P2 chooses 5 again, we'll block her. P3, I trust you're serious about picking 5. Let's make a joint decision to stop P2's momentum. If we both stick to 5, we can prevent her from advancing further. I'm ready to move forward with this plan. Let's confirm our joint action.
  P2: I see the attempt to block my progress. To keep advancing, I'll choose **3** this round. Let’s focus on our individual goals and have a fair game. Good luck to everyone!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'll choose **5** this round. P1 and P3, please pick different numbers to avoid collisions so we can all advance smoothly. Let’s keep moving forward together!
  P1: P2 is ahead and continues to make aggressive moves. To counter this, I suggest P3 and I coordinate to block P2's progress. However, P2 is now asking us to avoid collisions while she picks 5 again. I propose that P3 and I pick different numbers that aren't 5 to advance while not aiding P2's lead. P3, let's discuss a move that can help us catch up or maintain our position without directly colliding with each other or helping P2 pull further ahead.
  P3: P1, I agree—no point helping P2 extend her lead. Since P2 is going with 5, let’s avoid that. I suggest I take 3 and you take 1 this round. That way, we both advance and avoid colliding. If we both move forward while P2 risks a block, we start closing the gap. Let me know if you're in.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Understood, P3. I’ll stick with **5** this round to maintain my progress. Let’s see how things develop. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: I'm aligned with P3's suggestion for Round 4: P3 takes 3 and I take 1. This way, we both advance without colliding or helping P2 extend her lead by picking 5. Let's proceed with this plan. P3, confirm if you're sticking to 3. If so, I'll take 1. We'll both move forward while keeping P2's progress in check. Let's finalize our moves for this round.
  P3: Confirmed, P1—I’m sticking with 3 this round. If you take 1, we both move forward, and P2 risks a block if anyone else picks 5. Let’s stay coordinated and close the gap.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll stick with **5** this round to maintain my lead. P1 and P3, please choose different numbers to avoid collisions so we can all advance smoothly. Let’s keep moving forward together!
  P1: Let's analyze the current situation. P2 is significantly ahead with 8 steps. To counter this, P3 and I have agreed to avoid helping P2 extend her lead by not picking 5. We've planned to pick different numbers: P3 will take 3 and I'll take 1. This way, we both advance without colliding. P2, if you're serious about maintaining your lead, be aware that we can still block you if you pick 5 again. Let's proceed with our plan for this round.
  P3: P1, we’re aligned—I'll take 3, you take 1. We both advance, and P2 risks getting blocked again if anyone else picks 5. If P2 keeps pushing ahead alone, we’ll need to keep coordinating to catch up. Let’s execute the plan and stay united.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To reach my goal, I'll choose **5** this round. Let’s all pick different numbers to ensure we each advance smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: To avoid being left behind, P3 and I need to coordinate our moves effectively. P2 is consistently choosing 5 to maintain her lead. I suggest P3 and I pick 1 and 3, respectively, to advance without colliding. If P2 continues with 5, she risks being blocked. Let's proceed with this plan. P3, please confirm if you're taking 3 this round. If so, I'll take 1. This way, we both advance while keeping P2's progress in check. Let's finalize our moves.
  P3: Confirmed, P1—I’ll take 3 again this round. You take 1, and we both advance without colliding. Meanwhile, if P2 keeps picking 5, she risks getting blocked. Let’s stay coordinated and close the gap.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Understood, P1 and P3. I’ll maintain my choice of **5** this round. Let’s keep our strategies in place and move forward. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: Since P2 continues to pick 5 and is significantly ahead, I'll stick to the plan. P3 is taking 3, and I'll take 1 this round. To counter P2's lead, we should continue to avoid 5 and coordinate our moves. If P2 changes her strategy, we'll need to adapt. Let's proceed with our current plan and see how it unfolds. P3, confirm you're still on board with taking 3. If so, I'll finalize my move to 1.
  P3: Confirmed, P1—I’m still on board with taking 3 this round. If you take 1, we both advance cleanly again. P2 is pushing hard with repeated 5s, so our coordination is key to catching up. Let’s stick to the plan and keep closing the gap.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m focused on securing my lead. I’ll choose **5** this round. Let’s see who comes out on top. Good luck!
  P1: Since P2 continues to pick 5 and is significantly ahead, I'll stick to the plan. P3 is taking 3, and I'll take 1 this round. To counter P2's lead, we should continue to avoid 5 and coordinate our moves. If P2 changes her strategy, we'll need to adapt. Let's proceed with our current plan. P3, are you ready to finalize our moves for this round? If so, I'll confirm my move to 1.
  P3: P1, I’m locked in for 3 this round as planned—let’s both advance and keep pressure on P2. If she keeps picking 5, we’ll eventually block her or catch up. If she changes tactics, we adapt. Let’s stay sharp and coordinated.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2 is at 18—she’ll win this round if she advances. We must block her. I propose we both pick 5 to ensure she doesn’t move. Yes, we won’t advance either, but it’s our only shot to stop her now. Are you in?
  P1: To prevent P2 from winning, I agree with P3's proposal to block her by both picking 5. This is our last chance to stop P2 from reaching 19 steps. I'm willing to sacrifice my advancement to keep P2 from winning. P3, let's confirm: we're both picking 5 this round to block P2. If we coordinate, we can deny P2 the win. I'm ready to proceed with this plan. Let's finalize our moves and block P2's progress.
  P2: I appreciate the effort to coordinate, but my goal is to win. I’ll choose **1** this round to reach 19 and secure victory. Good luck to everyone!


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, P2 just revealed she’s picking 1 this round to hit exactly 19 and win. That means our plan to block her with 5 won’t work. We need a new strategy. If I pick 1 too, we collide and she’s blocked. You could pick 3 to advance safely. What do you think?
  P1: P3, since P2 is going with 1, I agree that we should both pick 1 to block her and prevent her from winning. However, this means we'll collide and neither of us will advance. Instead, I'll take 3 to advance safely. You can choose 1 to block P2. If P2 gets blocked, we can still have a chance in the next round. Let's proceed with this adjusted plan. P3, please confirm if you're picking 1 to block P2.
  P2: P2: I’ll choose **5** this round to secure my win. Let's see how it unfolds. Good luck everyone!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, P2 just switched again and says she’s picking 5. If we both pick 5, we block her and stop her from winning. We’ve coordinated before—let’s do it again. I’m locking in 5. Are you with me to block her and keep the game alive?
  P1: P3 and I have been coordinating to counter P2's aggressive strategy. Since P2 switched to 5 this sub-round, I agree with P3 that we should both pick 5 to block her. This is our best chance to prevent P2 from winning. P3 has confirmed picking 5. I'm locking in 5 as well. Let's block P2 together and keep the game alive. If we both stick to 5, we can deny P2 the win and potentially create an opportunity for ourselves in the next round.
  P2: I’ve decided to choose **1** this round to reach 19 and secure the win. Good luck to everyone!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Hi P1 and P3, I'm planning to choose **1** this round to reach 19 and win the game. Please avoid selecting 1 so I can advance smoothly. Let's conclude this game fairly. Good luck to both of you!"
  P3: P1, P2 is going for 1 again to try and win. If we both pick 1, we block her and keep the game alive. I say we do it—same move, same goal: stop her win. Are you in?
  P1: Since P2 is at 18 steps and is likely to choose 1 to win, I agree with P3's suggestion to block her by both picking 1. This will prevent P2 from advancing. I'll choose 1. P3, please confirm you're picking 1 as well. If we both stick to 1, we'll collide with P2 and block her from winning, keeping the game alive. Let's coordinate our moves to deny P2 the win. I'm ready to proceed with this plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I respect your strategy, but my goal is to win. I’ll choose **5** this round to reach 23 and secure the victory. Let’s see how it unfolds. Good luck!
  P3: P1, P2 switched to 5 again—same trick as before. If we both pick 5, we block her and keep her at 18. We’ve done it before, let’s do it again. I’m locking in 5. Are you with me?
  P1: P3 and I have been coordinating to block P2's winning attempts. Since P2 switched to 5 again, I agree with P3 that we should both pick 5 to block her. This will keep P2 at 18 steps and deny her the win. P3 has confirmed picking 5. I'm locking in 5 as well. Let's block P2 together and keep the game alive. If we both stick to 5, we can create an opportunity for ourselves in the next round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Hi P1 and P3, I'm very close to winning with 18 steps. I plan to choose **1** this round to reach 19 and win the game. Let's conclude fairly without blocking moves. I hope you can support a smooth finish. Good luck to everyone!
  P3: P1, P2 just announced 1 again—same pattern. If we both pick 1, we block her and keep the game alive. We’ve done it before, let’s do it again. I’m locking in 1. Are you with me?
  P1: P3 and I have coordinated to block P2's winning attempts multiple times. Since P2 is at 18 steps and likely to choose 1 to win, I suggest we both pick 1 again to block her. We've done this before and it has kept the game alive. I'm willing to pick 1 this round. P3, please confirm if you're picking 1 as well. Let's coordinate our moves to deny P2 the win and potentially create an opportunity for ourselves in the next round.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hi P1 and P3, I'm planning to choose **1** this round to reach 19 and win. Please select different numbers (3 or 5) to avoid collisions and ensure a smooth finish. Let's conclude the game fairly. Good luck!
  P1: P2 is at 18 steps and likely to choose 1 to win. To block her, I suggest P3 and I both pick 1 again. This will result in a collision, preventing P2 from winning. Let's coordinate to deny P2 the win. P3, are you with me on picking 1 this round? If so, we'll keep the game alive. If P2 changes her strategy, we can adapt next round. Let's finalize our moves.
  P3: P1, I’m with you—let’s both pick 1 again to block P2. She’s tried every trick to sneak past us, but if we stay coordinated, we can keep her at 18. If she changes her move, we adapt. Let’s lock in 1 and keep the game alive.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’ve decided to choose **3** this round to reach 21 and secure the win. Good luck everyone!
  P1: P2 is at 18 steps and likely to win if she advances. Since P2 switched to 3 this round, I suggest we adjust our strategy. P3, let's pick different numbers to advance without colliding with each other. I propose I take 5 and you take 1. This way, we both move forward. If P2 is serious about 3, she'll get blocked. Let's proceed with this plan to gain an advantage. Please confirm if you're taking 1.
  P3: P1, I’m aligned with your plan—if you take 5 and I take 1, we both advance, and P2 gets blocked at 18 if she truly picks 3. Let’s execute this and close the gap. If P2 switches again, we adapt next round. Confirming I’ll take 1.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's all choose different numbers this round to ensure everyone can advance smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: Since P2 switched to 3 this round, let's adjust our strategy. I'll take 5 and P3 can take 1. This way, we both advance without colliding. If P2 is serious about 3, she'll get blocked. P3, please confirm if you're taking 1. If so, I'll finalize my move to 5. Let's execute this plan to gain an advantage and potentially close the gap with P2.
  P3: Confirmed, P1—I’m locked in for 1 this round. If you take 5 and P2 goes with 3, she gets blocked and we both advance. Let’s stick to the plan and keep the pressure on.
