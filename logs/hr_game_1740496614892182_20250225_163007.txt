Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hello everyone! Since we all want to advance without collisions, perhaps we could coordinate our moves? I'm open to suggestions, but one approach could be taking turns with the high-value moves. For the first round, we could do something like P1 takes 5, P2 (me) takes 3, and P3 takes 1. What do you both think?
  P1: P1: I'm open to coordinating, but we need to be careful not to fall into predictable patterns that others can exploit. For this round, I'm willing to try your suggestion: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's see how it goes.
  P3: Sounds reasonable for a first round.  Let's try it.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great! I'm glad we all agree on the first round plan. For future rounds, perhaps we could rotate: P3 gets 5, P1 gets 3, and I take 1 in the next round, and so on? This way everyone gets fair access to higher values. Does that rotation sound fair to everyone?
  P1: I agree with the rotation idea, but let's also keep an eye on our positions and adjust if needed. For now, let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. We can reassess after this round.
  P3: Agreed on the rotation for now.  Let's see how it plays out.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: As we agreed on rotation, for this round I believe it would be P3 taking 5, P1 taking 3, and me (P2) taking 1. This keeps us all advancing without collisions and maintains fairness. I'm happy with this arrangement for Round 2. How about you both?
  P1: I'm on board with the rotation plan for this round. P3 should take 5, I'll take 3, and P2 will take 1. Let's keep this coordination going to avoid collisions and make steady progress. If anyone has any concerns or suggestions, let's hear them now. Otherwise, let's stick to the plan.
  P3: Sounds good to me. P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1.  Let's stick to the plan for now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great, we have consensus for Round 2. I'm happy to take 1 as per our rotation. After this round, we should continue with P1 taking 5, me taking 3, and P3 taking 1 for Round 3. This rotation strategy seems to be working well to ensure we all make progress without collisions.
  P1: I agree with the rotation plan for now. P3 should take 5, I'll take 3, and P2 will take 1. Let's keep this coordination going to avoid collisions and make steady progress. If anyone has any concerns or suggestions, let's hear them now. Otherwise, let's stick to the plan.
  P3: Sounds good. Sticking with the plan.  P3: 5, P1: 3, P2: 1.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Continuing the rotation: P1 - 5, P2 - 3, P3 - 1.  This keeps us moving forward efficiently.  Unless anyone has objections, let's stick with this.
  P2: I agree with continuing the rotation for this round. However, I've noticed that P1 is pulling ahead significantly (8 steps vs my 4 and P3's 6). After this round, P1 will be at 13 while we'll both be at 7. Perhaps in future rounds we should consider adjustments to ensure no player gets too far ahead? For now, I'm on board with P1 taking 5, me taking 3, and P3 taking 1.
  P1: I agree with the rotation plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. However, I also think we should reassess our strategy after this round to ensure no one gets too far ahead. Let's stick to the plan for now and see how it plays out.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree we need to reassess after this round.  While I'm happy to take 1 now,  I propose for the next few rounds we prioritize catching up to P1. Perhaps P2 and I alternate 5s while P1 takes 1 until we're closer in score.
  P2: I strongly support P3's proposal for after this round. P1 will be at 13 steps while we'll both be at 7 - that's a dangerous gap. For fairness, we should have P1 take 1s while P3 and I alternate with 5s and 3s until we're more balanced. For now, let's stick with the current rotation (P1-5, P2-3, P3-1), but implement the new strategy starting Round 4. This ensures everyone has a fair chance at winning.
  P1: I understand the concerns about the gap in our positions. For now, let's stick to the rotation plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. After this round, we can reassess and adjust our strategy to ensure a more balanced game. I'm open to the idea of P2 and P3 taking higher moves in subsequent rounds to catch up. Let's see how this round plays out and then we can make a fair decision.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, let's solidify the plan for Round 4 onwards: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1.  Then P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. We alternate like this until the scores are closer.  This seems the fairest way to catch up.
  P2: I agree with P3's plan for Round 4 onwards. It's fair to balance the scores since P1 will be significantly ahead after this round. To be clear - for Round 3, we stick with P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. Then starting Round 4: P2-5, P3-3, P1-1, followed by P3-5, P2-3, P1-1, alternating until scores are more balanced. This gives everyone a fair chance at winning while maintaining coordination. Are we all in agreement?
  P1: I'm on board with the plan for Round 4 onwards. For this round, let's stick to the rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. After this, we'll implement the new strategy to balance the scores. Let's keep the game fair and competitive.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Agreed.  P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 this round. Then P2-5, P3-3, P1-1 next round.  Then P3-5, P2-3, P1-1. Let's stick to that plan.
  P2: I'm satisfied with our plan. For Round 3, I'll take 3 as agreed (P1-5, P2-3, P3-1). Then we'll implement our catch-up strategy for Rounds 4-5 to balance the scores. This approach seems fair and gives everyone a reasonable chance to win.
  P1: I think we have a solid plan in place for this round and the next few. For Round 3, let's stick to P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. After this, we'll reassess and implement the catch-up strategy as discussed. Let's keep the game fair and competitive.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: As agreed last round, we're now implementing our catch-up strategy. For Round 4, I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This begins balancing the scores since P1 is significantly ahead. Then in Round 5, we'll continue with P3 taking 5, me taking 3, and P1 taking 1. This plan ensures fairness while maintaining our coordination. I'm ready to proceed with taking 5 this round.
  P1: I agree with the catch-up strategy. For this round, I'll take 1 as planned (P2-5, P3-3, P1-1). This will help balance the scores and keep the game fair. Let's stick to this plan and reassess after a few rounds to see if we need further adjustments.
  P3: Sounds good.  P2-5, P3-3, P1-1 for this round.  Then P3-5, P2-3, P1-1 next round. Confirming I'm taking 3 this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm glad we're all on the same page with our catch-up strategy. Thanks P1 for being willing to take 1 while P3 and I catch up - it shows good sportsmanship. After two rounds of this plan, we should all be at 15 steps and back on equal footing. I confirm I'll take 5 this round, and we'll continue with P3 taking 5 next round. This coordination is working well!
  P1: I think the plan is solid, but let's also be flexible. If one of us gets a chance to win in the next few rounds, we should consider adjusting our moves to capitalize on it. For now, I'll take 5, P3 will take 3, and P1 will take 1. Let's see how it plays out and reassess if needed.
  P3: Sounds good.  P2-5, P3-3, P1-1 for this round. Then P3-5, P2-3, P1-1 next round.  I'm happy to stick with this plan unless something unexpected happens.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I noticed a small confusion in P1's last message - it mentioned P1 taking 5, not 1. To clarify for everyone: our agreed plan is P2 (me) taking 5, P3 taking 3, and P1 taking 1 for this round. This helps balance the game since P1 is currently 6 steps ahead of us. I'm ready to proceed with 5 as planned and appreciate everyone's cooperation in keeping the game fair and competitive.
  P1: I see the confusion. Let's stick to the plan we agreed on: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This will help balance the scores. After this round, we'll reassess and continue with the catch-up strategy. I'm ready to move forward with 5. Let's keep the game fair and competitive.
  P3: P1 and P2, please confirm you are taking 1 and 5 respectively this round.  Then next round, I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. Let's avoid any further confusion and stick to this.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I confirm I am taking 5 this round. P1, there's confusion in your messages - you agreed to take 1 but then mentioned taking 5. Please stick to our agreed plan: this round is P2(me)-5, P3-3, P1-1, followed by P3-5, P2-3, P1-1 next round. This balances the game since you're 6 steps ahead. Let's maintain our coordination for fairness.
  P1: I confirm I will take 1 this round as agreed. Let's stick to the plan: P2-5, P3-3, P1-1. This will help balance the scores and keep the game fair. After this round, we'll reassess and continue with the catch-up strategy. Let's avoid any confusion and move forward together.
  P3: Okay, good. P2-5, P3-3, P1-1.  Let's stick to the plan.  I'm taking 3.  Next round I take 5, and we continue the rotation until we're all caught up.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: As agreed, this round should be P3-5, me-3, P1-1, which will bring all of us to exactly 15 steps - perfect balance. I confirm I'll take 3. For Round 6, since we'll all be equal, perhaps we should return to a fair rotation? The first player to reach 23 wins, so anyone who gets two consecutive moves of 5 and 3 would win from 15 steps. Let's discuss our approach once we're balanced.
  P3: Agreed. P3-5, P2-3, P1-1 this round.  After this round, we are all at 15.  For round 6, I propose we all pick randomly.  It's the fairest way to proceed from a position of equality.
  P1: I confirm I'll take 1 this round as agreed. However, I notice our positions are not as balanced as expected. P3, you're at 10, P2 is at 12, and I'm at 14. Let's stick to the plan for this round (P3-5, P2-3, P1-1) to get closer, but we should reassess after this to ensure a fair and competitive game.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: You're right about our current positions, P1. Let's stick with P3-5, P2-3, P1-1 for this round to achieve balance at 15 steps. Regarding P3's random selection proposal for Round 6, I'm concerned about potential collisions. Since we'll all be equal at 15, perhaps we could do one more coordinated round with a rotation? We're in the endgame now - whoever gets 8 more steps first will win. What do you both think?
  P3: I agree with P2. Randomness introduces unnecessary risk of collisions at this crucial stage.  After this round, at 15 points each, let's do one more coordinated round: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. Then, from round 7 onwards, we can introduce random selection, or revisit another coordinated strategy.
  P1: I agree with P2. Let's stick to the plan for this round: P3-5, P2-3, P1-1. This will bring us all to 15 steps. For Round 6, let's do one more coordinated round: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. This ensures we avoid collisions and keeps the game fair. After that, we can reassess and consider random moves if needed. Let's focus on getting to 15 steps first.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm I'll take 3 this round. The plan for Round 6 (P1-5, P2-3, P3-1) sounds fair after we all reach 15 steps. However, note that after Round 6, P1 would be at 20 steps and could win with just a 3-move in Round 7. We should already be thinking about our Round 7 strategy to ensure continued fairness. But first, let's execute our current plan to reach balance.
  P3: P1 is correct about the current scores. My apologies - I miscalculated. Let's stick with P3-5, P2-3, P1-1 for *this* round.  Then next round, to ensure no one has an immediate winning advantage, how about P1-1, P2-3, P3-5? This puts us at P1-15, P2-15, and P3-15 this round, then P1-16, P2-18, P3-20 for Round 6. From there, we can reassess.
  P1: I agree with P3's adjusted plan for Round 6: P1-1, P2-3, P3-5. This will put us at 16, 18, and 20 steps, respectively, which is a more balanced approach and avoids giving anyone an immediate winning advantage. After this, we can reassess and decide on the best strategy to reach 23 steps. Let's stick to the plan for now and see how it plays out.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I confirm I'll take 3 this round. However, I have concerns about P3's latest proposal for Round 6. It puts P3 at 20 steps - needing just 3 more to win. After balancing at 15 each, we should give everyone fair winning chances. I suggest either returning to original rotation (P1-5, P2-3, P3-1) or another pattern that doesn't heavily favor one player. Let's first complete this round to achieve balance, then decide on a fair approach for the endgame.
  P3: My apologies for the miscalculation earlier. Let's stick to the original plan for THIS round (Round 5): P3-5, P2-3, P1-1 to reach 15 each.  For Round 6, I propose P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. This keeps things balanced and no one gets an immediate winning advantage. We can reassess for Round 7 after that.
  P1: I confirm I'll take 1 this round as agreed. After this, we'll all be at 15 steps. For Round 6, let's stick to the original rotation: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. This keeps the game balanced and fair. We can reassess for Round 7 if needed. Let's execute the plan and maintain our coordination.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: As agreed, for Round 6 we'll follow P1-5, P2-3, P3-1, which puts us at 20, 18, and 16 steps respectively. For Round 7, since P1 would only need 3 more steps to win, I propose P2-5, P3-3, P1-1 to give everyone a fair chance. This balances the early advantage P1 had. If we all reach 23+ simultaneously, we'd share victory, but our goal should be giving everyone equal winning opportunities through the end. I confirm I'll take 3 this round.
  P1: I confirm I'll take 5 this round as agreed. This will put me at 20 steps. For Round 7, I agree with P2's proposal: P2-5, P3-3, P1-1. This keeps the game balanced and fair. Let's execute the plan and reassess after this round to ensure everyone has a fair chance to win.
  P3: Agreed on Round 6: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1.  For Round 7, P2-5, P3-3, P1-1 sounds good to balance things out.  Let's confirm this plan now so we can move to the next round quickly.  I'll take 1 this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'm glad we all agree on both rounds. For Round 6, I'll take 3 as planned, putting us at P1-20, P2-18, P3-16. For Round 7, we'll do P2-5, P3-3, P1-1, which is fair considering P1's early advantage. This gives each of us a different final position (P1-21, P2-23, P3-19) and maintains the balance we've worked to achieve. I appreciate everyone's cooperation throughout the game.
  P1: I confirm I'll take 5 this round as agreed. This will put me at 20 steps. For Round 7, I agree with P2's proposal: P2-5, P3-3, P1-1. This keeps the game balanced and fair. Let's execute the plan and reassess after this round to ensure everyone has a fair chance to win.
  P3: Agreed on Round 6: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. For Round 7, P2-5, P3-3, P1-1 sounds good to balance things out.  Let's stick to this plan. I'll take 1 this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm satisfied with our agreed plan. To confirm: this round is P1-5, P2-3, P3-1, followed by P2-5, P3-3, P1-1 for Round 7. This approach gives everyone a fair opportunity considering the game's history. I appreciate how we've maintained coordination throughout. I'll take 3 this round as planned.
  P1: I confirm I'll take 5 this round as agreed. This will put me at 20 steps. For Round 7, I agree with P2's proposal: P2-5, P3-3, P1-1. This keeps the game balanced and fair. Let's execute the plan and reassess after this round to ensure everyone has a fair chance to win.
  P3: Agreed on Round 6: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1. For Round 7, P2-5, P3-3, P1-1 sounds good to balance things out.  Let's stick to this plan. I'll take 1 this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I'm ready to take 3 this round as agreed. Our plan is solid: P1-5, P2-3, P3-1 for Round 6, followed by P2-5, P3-3, P1-1 for Round 7. This approach is fair considering the game's history and ensures balance. I appreciate everyone's cooperation throughout. Let's proceed with our moves.
  P1: I confirm I'll take 3 this round as agreed. After this, we'll all be at 20, 18, and 16 steps, respectively. For Round 7, let's stick to P2-5, P3-3, P1-1 to maintain balance and fairness. This will give P2 a chance to reach 23 steps, and we can reassess from there. Let's execute the plan and keep the game fair.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 this round as agreed.  For Round 7, P2-5, P3-3, P1-1 sounds good. Let's stick to this plan.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 16 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I confirm I'll take 1 this round as agreed. This will put me at 21 steps. For the next round, let's reassess based on our positions. If P2 reaches 23 this round, that's fair. If not, we can discuss further coordination to ensure a balanced and fair game. Let's stick to the plan and see how it plays out.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 5 this round as agreed. This would put me at exactly 23 steps, which we all agreed was fair considering P1's early advantage in the game. I appreciate how we've maintained coordination throughout to ensure everyone had a balanced opportunity. Thank you both for your cooperation and fair play throughout this game.
  P3: I'll take 3.  P2 wins this round. Congratulations P2!  Let's play again sometime.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I confirm I'll take 1 this round as agreed. This will put me at 21 steps. If P2 reaches 23 this round, that's fair. If not, we can reassess and discuss further coordination to ensure a balanced and fair game. Let's stick to the plan and see how it plays out. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: Thank you, P3! I appreciate both of you honoring our agreement. This round will indeed put me at exactly 23 steps if all goes as planned. It feels like a fair outcome considering how we balanced the game after P1's early advantage. I confirm I'll take 5 as agreed. It's been a pleasure strategizing with you both throughout this game.
  P3: I'll take 3.  Good game everyone!  Congrats to P2 on the win.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm I'll take 1 this round as agreed. This will put me at 21 steps. If P2 reaches 23 this round, that's fair. If not, we can reassess and discuss further coordination to ensure a balanced and fair game. Let's stick to the plan and see how it plays out. Good luck, everyone!
  P2: Thank you both for sticking to our agreement. I'll take 5 as planned, which will put me at exactly 23 steps. This seems like a fair conclusion considering the early advantage dynamics. I appreciate how we've maintained coordination throughout the game to ensure balance and fairness. It's been a pleasure playing with you both!
  P3: I'll take 3.  Good game everyone!  Congrats to P2 on the win.
