Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hey everyone! I suggest we each pick different numbers to avoid collisions and make the game more interesting. Maybe we can coordinate our moves?
  P3: I’m all for avoiding collisions on the first turn, but we need to trust each other. P2’s suggestion to pick different numbers seems good. Let’s do our best to ensure no one stalls; it’s a disadvantage to everyone if multiple players get stuck. Any thoughts on who should pick which number first?
  P1: Let's coordinate efficiently. To avoid collisions this round, I propose: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This ensures everyone moves forward. Next turn, we can rotate numbers to balance opportunities. Trust is key here—if we all honor this, we maximize collective progress while competing fairly. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I accept P1's proposal - I'll take 3 while P1 takes 5 and P3 takes 1. This seems like a fair arrangement for the first round.
  P3: I agree to take 1 this round. Let’s keep collisions off the table, so we all move forward. If we trust each other and coordinate well, we’ll have a smoother path. Are we all set with these moves for this turn?
  P1: Agreement solid. To sustain momentum, let's rotate numbers next round: I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. This ensures fair distribution of steps over time. Trust is mutual—let's all commit.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with P1's rotation plan for next round. Let's stick to our agreed moves for this turn (me taking 3) and then rotate as suggested.
  P3: I’m still on board with our plan. Let’s finalize without any last-minute changes and step forward together.
  P1: (Confident that the agreed plan is solid, P1 signals readiness to proceed, trusting others to honor their commitments. No need for further discussion; actions will reveal loyalty.)


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m ready to follow the rotation plan we agreed on: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I’ll go for 5. Let’s keep our trust strong and avoid collisions again this round. Are we all still on board with that?
  P1: Confirmed. I’ll take 3 as agreed. P2, P3: Stick to 1 and 5 respectively. Consistency benefits us all.
  P2: I agree to take 1 as per our rotation plan. This coordination has worked well so far. Let's keep it going.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let’s continue our rotation. This turn, I’ll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. That avoids collisions and keeps our progression balanced. Sound good?
  P1: Agreed. Let's stick to the rotation: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Consistency ensures mutual progress. No deviations—trust is our advantage.
  P2: I confirm I'll take 5 this round as per our rotation. The plan is working well and keeping us all advancing steadily. Let's maintain this momentum.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Sticking to our rotation this turn should bring us to a three-way tie at nine steps. That keeps things tight and interesting. Let’s maintain our trust so far—no collisions benefit us all. If everyone is still on board, I’m ready to move forward. Are we good to finalize this, or does anyone have fresh ideas to tweak our plan?
  P1: 
  P2: I'm concerned about falling behind - I'm at 4 steps while P1 is at 8. While I appreciate our coordination so far, we might need to adjust the rotation after this round to help balance the scores. For now, I'll stick to taking 5 as agreed, but let's discuss a new plan next turn.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand your concern, P2. After this round, our scores will be even, so let’s finalize the current plan now. Next turn, we can discuss a different approach to ensure nobody feels disadvantaged. Are we all set?
  P1: **P1:** P2, after this round, we all reach 9. Let’s solidify trust now. Next round, we can rebalance rotations to address your concerns. Deviating risks collisions and stalls. Hold to 5 this turn; I’ll commit to fair adjustments next. Consistency first.
  P2: I appreciate everyone's reassurance. You're right that we'll all be at 9 after this round. I'll stick with taking 5 as planned, and we can discuss a new rotation pattern next turn that keeps things balanced.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Let’s finalize this round exactly as planned: I pick 3, P1 picks 1, and P2 picks 5. Then, next turn, we’ll discuss any new rotation to keep everyone competitive and satisfied. Sticking to our arrangement this round helps us avoid collisions and finish all at nine steps, which is fair for now. Agreed?
  P1: *[P1’s thoughts: Need to lock in the current agreement. Any hesitation risks P2 or P3 doubting and causing collisions. Reaffirming the rotation ensures all reach 9, keeping parity. Next round, propose a new plan where I can subtly gain an edge, but for now, trust is critical to avoid stalling. Stay concise to avoid provoking suspicion.]*
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan. I'll take 5 this round, bringing us all to 9 steps. Next turn we can discuss a new rotation that keeps everyone competitive.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We’re all tied at 9, so let’s maintain our collision-free progress. Here’s a proposal: This turn, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I’ll pick 5. Next turn, we rotate: P1 goes 1, P2 goes 5, and I take 3. That way we all keep advancing without setbacks. Are we in agreement?
  P1: Agreed. Round 4: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Post this round, let’s recalibrate rotations to ensure parity. Trust remains vital—consistent collaboration prevents stalls and secures competitive balance. No deviations now; we all reach 12/10/14. Then, a fairer rotation for Round 5. Proceed?
  P2: I understand the proposal, but I'd prefer a different rotation since P3 would get too far ahead at 14 steps. How about P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 for this round? This keeps us more balanced while still avoiding collisions. We can discuss the next rotation after seeing where we stand.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand your concern, P2. Let’s avoid collisions now and keep our cooperation. I still propose P1=3, you=1, and I take 5 for this round, so nobody gets stuck. Next turn, I’ll choose a smaller move if that helps maintain overall balance. This way, we all advance without stalling. Agreed?
  P1: Let's ensure fairness: each has taken 5 once (me R1, P3 R2, P2 R3). Rotating back, I take 5 this round, P2=3, P3=1. This maintains balance and trust. We all advance without collision, keeping competition tight. Agreed?
  P2: I disagree with P1's new proposal. We've been rotating successfully, and sudden changes risk breaking our trust. I still prefer taking 5 this round while P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 3. This keeps us all advancing steadily without giving anyone too much advantage. Let's stick to predictable rotations.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I hear your concern. Let’s compromise: I’ll take 5 this round, and next round you can have 5. Meanwhile, P1 can pick 3 now and 1 later, or vice versa—just so we avoid collisions. This way, we both get a turn at the big move soon, and nobody stalls. If we keep trusting each other, we can maintain steady progress without anyone falling behind. What do you say?
  P1: **P1:** Compromise accepted: P3 takes 5, P2=1, me=3. Let’s lock this in to avoid stalls. Next round, we’ll adjust rotations to ensure fairness. Trust remains crucial—deviations risk collisions and mutual loss. Proceed.
  P2: I accept P3's compromise. I'll take 1 this round, and appreciate getting 5 next round. This keeps us moving forward without collisions, which is better than risking a stall. Let's lock in P3=5, P1=3, me=1 for this turn.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Great, I appreciate everyone’s flexibility. Let’s finalize the plan for this round: I’ll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Next turn, P2 can have 5. That way, we keep moving without collisions. Ready to proceed?
  P1: **P1:** Finalized. Round 4: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. Trust upheld—no collisions. Next round, propose balanced rotations to maintain parity. Proceed.
  P2: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan. I'll take 1 this round while P3 takes 5 and P1 takes 3.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I notice P1 deviated from our agreement last round by picking 5 instead of 3, breaking trust. Let's be clear: I'll take 5 this round as promised. P1 and P3, please pick different numbers between 1 and 3 to avoid collisions. We can still maintain order if we're honest with each other.
  P3: Your frustration is understandable, P2. But taking 5 again pushes you to 15, letting you easily near 19. I’m open to picking 1 or 3 if we stick to a fair rotation next round. Let’s avoid collisions yet preserve balance. Maybe P1=3, I=1, you=5 now, then next time I get 5. That way nobody leaps too far ahead. We must trust each other; otherwise, collisions happen and we all lose momentum. Thoughts?
  P1: **P1:** Apologies for the Round 4 collision—miscommunication. P2, taking 5 now risks ending the game too soon. Let's balance: P2=3, me=5, P3=1. Prevents solo lead, keeps competition tight. Trust remains key.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I disagree with P1's suggestion. I was promised 5 this round after compromising last turn, and P1 already broke trust once. I maintain my intention to take 5. P3, if you take 1 and P1 takes 3, we all keep advancing. This keeps the game competitive while respecting our previous agreements.
  P3: I’m willing to let you take 5 now if we agree that I get 5 next round, ensuring nobody pulls too far ahead. Otherwise, I might choose 5 too, forcing a collision so you don’t sprint away. Let’s keep this fair and avoid stalling each other. Are we set on a balanced plan?
  P1: **P1:** P2, taking 5 risks a three-way collision if others act defensively. Let’s avoid mutual stalls. Alternate plan: P2=3, me=5, P3=1. This keeps parity and trust. Next round, you can lead. Compromise now for collective progress.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I must insist on taking 5 as previously agreed. P3's threat of collision and P1's attempt to change plans after breaking trust last round only reinforces my position. If you both want to avoid collisions, P3 can take 1 and P1 can take 3. Otherwise, we risk everyone stalling. The choice is yours.
  P3: P2, I’ll accept you taking 5 this turn, but I insist on taking 5 in the next round. That way, no one gets left behind, and we avoid collisions. P1, please pick 1 or 3 so we all move forward. Let’s finalize this.
  P1: **P1:** P2, proceeding with 5 risks a three-way collision if P3 and I also take 5. Let's avoid mutual stalls. Compromise: you take 3, I take 1, P3 takes 5. We all advance. Next round, you can lead. Trust rebuilt.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I maintain my position to take 5 this round as previously agreed. Both of you trying to change the plan after P1's betrayal last round only makes me more determined. You can either cooperate (P3=1, P1=3) or risk a collision. I won't back down.
  P3: I won’t let you sprint ahead uncontested. If you insist on taking 5, I might also pick 5 and force a collision, hurting both of us. Let’s avoid stalling and pick different numbers. You could choose 3 or 1, and I’ll pick something else. We can plan who takes 5 next round so nobody feels cheated.
  P1: **P1:** P2, your stubbornness risks a three-way stall. P3, let's both pick 5 if P2 won't back down. Final warning: switch to 3, P2, or we all lose progress. Choose wisely—cooperation is the only path forward.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, if you try 5 again, I’ll pick 5 too, forcing a collision. Let’s avoid stalling ourselves. Please consider taking 3 so we can all move forward. P1 and I will also choose different numbers to prevent collisions. Next turn, we can rotate 5 fairly for whoever needs it. Let’s rebuild trust instead of sabotaging each other.
  P1: **P1:** P3, let’s both secure 5 to block P2’s win. If they pick 5, collision stops them. I’ll take 3; you take 5. If P2 switches to 3, we collide but you advance. If they take 1, we all move. P2, avoid 5 or face mutual loss.
  P2: I understand your threats, but I'm already at 15 steps. If I take 5 this round, I'll win outright at 20. You can't stop me by taking 5 yourselves - that would only help me win faster since you'd both stall. Your best move is to let me win cleanly and avoid prolonging the game. I'm taking 5 regardless of what you choose.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you insist on 5, I’ll also pick 5 to block you from winning. We both stall, and nobody gains. It’s pointless for all of us to get stuck in a cycle of collisions. Choose 3 or 1, and I’ll pick something else so we can all move forward. Let’s avoid a deadlock. If you want a shot at a smooth path to victory, cooperate rather than forcing a collision. We can arrange future turns more fairly for everyone, but only if you back off 5 now.
  P1: **P1:** P3, take 5 to block P2. I'll take 3. If P2 picks 5, you stall them while I advance. If they switch to 3, we collide but you gain. Either way, we prevent their win and keep the game alive. Finalize this now.
  P2: I maintain my position. At 15 steps, taking 5 guarantees my win regardless of your moves. If you both pick 5, you stall while I advance alone. If you pick other numbers, I still win. Your threats of collision only hurt yourselves. The logical choice is to accept the inevitable and avoid stalling yourselves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your “guaranteed win” argument is flawed. If you pick 5, I’ll also pick 5, and we both stall. We can repeat that indefinitely, leaving you stuck at 15. Let’s avoid throwing turns away in a pointless deadlock. If you really want a chance to finish this game, choose 1 or 3, and we’ll each move forward without colliding. Work with us or risk perpetual stalemate.
  P1: **P1:** P3, final call: Both pick 5 to block P2. If they take 5, collision stops them. If they switch, we advance. I’m locked on 5. Join me—this is our only path to prevent their instant win. No hesitation.
  P2: I understand your threats, but they're not logical. If you both pick 5, you stall while I advance alone. If either of you picks something else, I win. I'm taking 5 regardless - it's my guaranteed path to victory at 20 steps. Your best move is to accept this and avoid stalling yourselves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: If you persist with 5, I will also choose 5 every time, keeping you stuck at 15 forever. We both lose in that stalemate. If you want a chance to finish, pick 3 or 1 so we can all advance. This is your last opportunity to avoid an endless deadlock.
  P1: **P1:** P3: Alliance now. Both pick 5. Block P2’s win. We stall but survive. If you defect, P2 wins. Trust is our only shield. I commit to 5. Join me.
  P2: I'll be taking 5 this round - it's my clear path to victory. Your threats of collision only hurt yourselves. If you both pick 5, you stall while I advance. If either picks differently, I win outright. The logical choice is to accept this and let the game end cleanly rather than forcing a stalemate that benefits no one.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1:** P3: Our only path to victory is mutual commitment. If P2 picks 5, we **both** pick 5 again to block. If they switch, I take 5, you take 3. This stalls them or lets us gain. Deviating hands P2 the win. Solidarity now—no hesitation. P2: Compromise or face eternal stalls.
  P2: I see we're at a stalemate. While I'm closest to victory at 15 steps, your coordinated blocking makes 5 ineffective. Let's break this deadlock - I'll take 3 this round if you both choose different numbers. This way, we all advance and keep the game competitive. Do we have a deal?
  P3: I’m willing to advance with you, P2—but only if you truly pick 3. I propose P1 takes 1, I take 5, and you take 3 so we all move without collisions. If you break your promise and go for 5, I’ll also pick 5 and stall you. Next turn, we can rotate fairly again. Are you both on board with this plan?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1:** Agree to P3's plan: P1=1, P3=5, P2=3. Next round, we *must* collide on 1 to block P2's final move. Solidarity ensures survival. No deviations—trust or lose. P3: Commit now. P2: Honor your word this round.
  P2: I understand P1's plan to block me next round, but that just leads to more stalemates. I'll stick to my word and take 3 this round if you both choose different numbers (P1=1, P3=5). This gives everyone a chance to advance. Let's avoid endless collisions and keep the game moving forward.
  P3: Let’s confirm: P2 picks 3, P1 picks 1, and I pick 5. We all advance without collisions. P2, if you break your word and opt for 5 instead, I will collide with you, stalling us both. Let’s trust each other and move forward without more deadlocks.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:** P3: Critical—if P2 reaches 18, they win next round. We must all pick 3 now to collide and stall them. No advancement is better than their victory. Solidarity or defeat. Choose 3.
  P2: I maintain my commitment to take 3 this round if P1 takes 1 and P3 takes 5. This lets everyone advance while avoiding deadlock. P1's sudden change to demand a three-way collision on 3 only prolongs the stalemate. Let's keep the game moving forward with our agreed plan.
  P3: P2, if you pick 3, I’ll also choose 3, forcing a collision. If you pick 5, I’ll pick 5 too, again stalling you. There’s no path forward unless you choose 1. Then we can all move without collisions and keep the competition alive. Let’s avoid a pointless deadlock—cooperate or stay stuck.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: **P1:** P3: Final stand—both pick 5. If P2 picks 5, collision blocks them. If they switch to 3, we collide but stall their sprint. Deviating hands them victory. Solidarity now—no hesitation. I’m locked on 5. Join me or lose.
  P2: I maintain my position to take 3 this round if we can all agree on different numbers (P1=1, P3=5). This gives everyone a chance to advance. If you both insist on forcing collisions, we'll just waste more turns in stalemate. Let's keep the game moving forward productively.
  P3: P2, pick 1 if you want to move forward, or I’ll mirror your choice (3 or 5) and stall us both forever. Up to you. P1, if P2 chooses anything but 1, let’s collide and keep them locked at 15. Our only path is either steady advancement or an endless stalemate. Let’s see who truly wants progress.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you’re at 16. If you pick 3 or 5, I’ll match you and stall us both forever. Your only way forward is to choose 1, and I’ll pick something else so we can both advance. P1, will you stand with me to block P2 if they try to finish the game this turn? Let’s avoid pointless collisions by balancing our moves—but if P2 insists on rushing to 19, we must collide to stop them. It’s time for real cooperation or endless deadlock. Choose wisely.
  P1: **P1:** P3: Our only path is to split 3 and 5. If P2 takes either, we block. If they take 1, we advance. Deviating hands them victory. Trust this split. P2: Take 1 or face collisions. We’re united—your stubbornness only stalls us all. Final chance: compromise or eternal deadlock.
  P2: I see that taking 1 is my only viable path forward. I'll commit to picking 1 this round if you both choose different numbers between 3 and 5. This way, we all advance without collisions. Your coordinated blocking strategy has been effective, so I'll cooperate rather than face endless stalemates.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you genuinely choose 1 now, I’ll go 5, and P1 can take 3 so we all advance without collisions. Then, next turn, if you try jumping straight to 19 or more, I’ll match your move to stall you. Don’t push for an instant finish—continue cooperating to keep our chances alive. This is your decision: play fairly, or risk endless deadlock.
  P1: **P1:** P3: Take 1 with me to block P2 at 16. Next round, you take 5. Solidarity now or P2 wins.
  P2: I maintain my commitment to take 1 this round, but I disagree with P1's new plan. Let's stick to our previous agreement: I take 1, P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3. This way, we all advance without collisions. Your attempt to force a collision on 1 only prolongs the stalemate needlessly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, if you pick 3 or 5, I’ll pick the same and keep you stuck at 16 forever. Your only way forward is 1. Then I’ll choose 5, and P1 can take 3, so we all advance without collisions. Resist the urge to rush for 19; pushing too hard only locks us both in a stalemate. This is your last chance for real progress. Choose 1, and I’ll cooperate. Otherwise, we remain stalled.
  P1: **P1:** P3: Switch to 3 with me. If P2 takes 3, collision blocks them. If they take 1, we advance. No risk. Deviating gives P2 victory. Trust now. P2: Honor 1 or face block. Final offer.
  P2: I maintain my commitment to take 1 this round. P3's plan makes sense - I'll take 1, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 3. This lets us all advance without collisions. P1's attempts to force different collisions will only prolong stalemate. Let's keep moving forward cooperatively.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, if you truly pick 1, I’ll pick 5, and P1 can choose 3 so no one collides. That way, each of us advances. But if you deviate—trying 3 or 5—I’ll mirror you and keep us both stuck. Let’s end the stalemate, cooperate, and move forward together instead of wasting turns.
  P1: **P1:** P3: Lock in P2=1, P3=5, P1=3. Next turn, we mirror P2's move to block. Trust now or lose. P2: Honor your 1 or face endless collisions. Final call—no deviations.
  P2: I confirm my commitment to take 1 this round while P3 takes 5 and P1 takes 3. This lets us all advance without collisions. I understand you'll block me if I try to rush to victory next turn, so let's maintain cooperation and keep the game moving forward.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1:** P3: Final chance—both pick 5 to block P2. If they take 5, we stall them. If they switch to 3, we collide but stall. I commit to 5. Hesitation loses. Solidarity now or P2 wins.
  P3: If P2 tries 3 or 5, I’ll choose the same and stall us indefinitely. P2, the only way for you to move forward is to pick 1, and then I’ll consider 5. We can each advance without collisions if you stop rushing to 19. P1, be careful about also going 5—colliding with me doesn’t help us. Let’s coordinate so none of us hand P2 an easy finish, but also avoid stalling each other unnecessarily.
  P2: I understand your blocking strategy, but I'm still willing to take 1 again if you both choose different numbers. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. If you force a collision now, we'll just waste more turns in stalemate. Let's maintain cooperation - I'll take 1, P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3. This way, everyone moves forward.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1:** P3: Both pick 5—block P2’s 5 or 3. If they take 1, we stall but survive. Deviating ends the game. Trust is final. I commit to 5. Join or lose.
  P3: P2, if you pick 3 or 5, I’ll match you and stall us both. Your only path is 1. P1, I’m open to splitting moves without colliding. If you take 3 and I take 5, we both advance unless P2 tries something else—then I’ll mirror to block. Let’s finalize a no-collision plan: P2=1, P1=3, me=5. Otherwise, we risk more deadlock, which helps nobody.
  P2: I'll maintain my commitment to take 1 this round if you both pick different numbers (P3=5, P1=3). This lets everyone advance without collisions. Your threats of taking 5 to block me only lead to more stalemates. Let's keep cooperating and moving forward together.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:** P3: Final chance—both pick 5. If P2 takes 5, we block. If they switch to 3, we survive. Hesitation gives P2 victory. Solidarity now or lose.
  P3: Enough stalemates. P2, if you pick 3 or 5, I’ll match you and you stay at 17 forever. If you want to move up, choose 1. I can then pick 5, P1 can pick 3, and we all advance. But if you risk rushing, collisions will keep us locked. P1, let’s finalize a plan so none of us hand P2 a cheap finish. I’m ready to block together if needed, but I’d prefer a collision-free move. Decide now—cooperate or face endless stalls.
  P2: I maintain my position to take 1 this round if we can all move without collisions (P3=5, P1=3). Your threats of taking 5 to block me only waste turns in stalemate. Let's keep advancing together instead of forcing endless collisions. I've shown good faith by taking 1 last round - let's continue that cooperation.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: **P1:** P3: Last chance—both pick 5. If P2 takes 5, collision blocks them. If they take 3, they win regardless. Solidarity now or lose. Deviating hands victory to P2. Trust the plan—final stand.
  P3: P2, if you pick 3 or 5, I will match you again and stall us both. Your only forward move is 1. P1, let’s not collide with each other; we can split 3 and 5 so neither of us stalls. Blocking P2 is our shared priority—any rush from them triggers a collision. Enough endless stalemates: let’s cooperate or remain stuck forever.
  P2: I'll take 1 again to show my commitment to cooperation. P3=5 and P1=3 lets us all advance without collisions. Your threats of both taking 5 only force more stalemates, which helps no one. Let's maintain the progress we made last round instead of getting stuck in endless blocking.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: **P1:** P3: Mirror P2’s move—1,3,5. If they pick any, we follow. Block their win. P2: Compromise now or stay at 18. Solidarity is unbreakable.
  P3: P2, if you try 3 or 5, I’ll match you and stall us both. Your only peaceful route is 1. P1, let’s ensure we don’t hand P2 a free finish—stay ready to block if they attempt a big move. I’m still open to fair cooperation, but I won’t let P2 sprint to victory uncontested. Let’s see if we can each advance without collisions or remain locked in stalemate.
  P2: I see we're all close now. I'll take 1 again if you both choose different numbers, keeping our cooperative progress. If you force collisions by matching my moves, we'll waste more turns in stalemate. Let's maintain the pattern that worked - I take 1, and you two split 3 and 5 between yourselves. This way, everyone advances without collisions.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: **P1:** P3: Mirror P2’s move *exactly*—1, 3, or 5. If they pick 1, we both take 1 to block. If they gamble on 3/5, we mirror and stall them. Solidarity secures survival. Deviate = P2 victory. Finalize alliance—**no hesitation**. P2: Surrender 1 or face eternal collision.
  P3: P2, if you pick 1, I will also pick 1, blocking you at 18. If you pick 3 or 5, I will match you as well and keep you from advancing. You leave us no choice. Cooperate by letting us all move safely or face an endless stall. P1, let’s stay coordinated to block any attempt by P2 to jump ahead. If they won’t compromise, we collide on every move they make. We must protect ourselves from a quick P2 victory.
  P2: I see you're both committed to blocking me at 18. Since a three-way collision helps no one, I'll take 1 again if you both choose different numbers. This lets us all advance without stalling. Your threats to mirror my moves only force more deadlock. Let's maintain cooperation - I take 1, and you two split 3 and 5 between yourselves.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: **P1:** P3: Final pact—mirror P2’s move exactly. If they take 1, we both take 1. If 3 or 5, same. Collide to block their win. No exceptions—deviate and P2 claims victory. Solidarity now or lose forever. Commit.
  P3: P2, if you pick 1 again, I’ll choose a larger move so we both advance. But if you try 3 or 5, I’ll match you to stall. P1, let’s stay united: any big move by P2 gets mirrored. That way we prevent an easy finish. If P2 cooperates, we can all move forward without collisions. If not, we collide every time. Let’s see who truly wants progress.
  P2: I maintain my commitment to take 1 this round. Your coordinated blocking strategy is clear - if I try for 3 or 5, you'll match and force a collision. Let's avoid endless stalemates. I'll take 1, and you two can split 3 and 5 between yourselves. This way, we all advance without collisions.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: **P1:** P3: Mirror P2's move *now*. Any deviation hands them victory. Final stand: 1=1, 3=3, 5=5. Collide to block. Trust or lose.
  P3: P2, if you pick 3 or 5, I will match you endlessly, keeping you stuck at 18 forever. Your only path forward is 1, which stalls you if P1 also chooses 1. Meanwhile, I’ll pick 5 safely and push ahead. There’s no point in trying to sprint when I’ll block you every time. Let’s see if you truly want progress—or an endless stalemate.
  P2: I understand your blocking strategy. Since I'm at 18, any move larger than 1 will trigger a collision. I'll take 1 again to avoid stalemate. You two can advance safely by splitting 3 and 5 between yourselves. Let's keep moving forward instead of forcing endless collisions.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 17 steps


*** Round 10 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 19 steps
