Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Hey P2 and P3, let's coordinate to avoid collisions this round. I propose: I'll move 3, P2 move 1, P3 move 5. That way we all advance cleanly. Thoughts?"
  P3: I'm not sure I trust P1's proposal. If I move 5 and P2 moves 1, that sounds okay, but what if P2 doesn't follow through? I think a simpler plan would be for one of us to move 3 and the other two to move 1 and 5. That way, we still avoid collisions. P2, what do you think about this alternative?
  P2: P3, I agree that using distinct moves 1, 3, and 5 is the way to go so we all advance. However, P1's plan for me to take 1 isn't great. In your alternative, what distribution of 1, 3, and 5 were you thinking of for P1, P2, and P3?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "P2, I understand your hesitation about taking 1. Let's adapt: you take 5 (fast progress), I'll take 3, and P3 takes 1. P3, this gives you a chance for 5 next round—fair rotation? We avoid collisions and all advance this turn."
  P3: P1 is trying to adapt the plan. However, I'm still not convinced about their intentions. P2, let's simplify: why don't we all agree to move 3 this round? It's a neutral choice and if everyone follows, we all collide and stay at 0. If someone deviates, they risk not advancing while the others do. It's a low-risk way to test each other's commitment to cooperation. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I see your idea for a test, but an all-3 collision means no progress for anyone this turn. I'd rather we try a plan where we all move forward. P1's most recent suggestion (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1) achieves that. While it's 1 for you this round, P1 did mention fair rotation for future rounds, which sounds reasonable. I'm ready to commit to that plan if you and P1 are. What do you think about making some progress together?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your all-3 test wastes a turn—zero progress for anyone. Trust is built by advancing together. Our adapted plan (me:3, P2:5, you:1) is fair: you get first pick of 5 next round, and we all gain steps now. P2 supports this. Let's prove cooperation works—commit to 1 this round, and I'll honor your 5 priority next turn. No tricks.
  P3: P2 seems willing to cooperate under P1's adapted plan. I'm still unsure about P1's true intentions, but moving forward is better than stagnation. To test P1's commitment, I'll suggest a slight modification: let's stick with P1's adapted plan this round (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1), but explicitly agree that next round, we'll rotate and I'll get to choose 5. This way, we make progress and clarify the rotation for future rounds. P1, P2, are you agreeable to this clarification?
  P2: P3, I agree with your clarification. P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 this round, and P3 gets priority for 5 next round. This sounds like a solid plan to me. P1, are you also on board with this?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Since we agreed on P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 this round and P3 getting priority for 5 next round, I'll follow through. P3, you should move 5 this round as per our agreement. P1 and P2, to avoid collisions, let's adjust: P1 can move 1 and P2 can move 3. This keeps our progress smooth and collision-free. P1, P2, are you okay with this plan for this round?
  P1: I agree to P3's proposal for this round: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, P3 moves 5. This honors our rotation and avoids collisions. For Round 3, let's prioritize fairness: since I'm moving 1 this round, I should get 5 next to balance progress. P2 and P3, confirm you support this?
  P2: I agree with P3's plan for this round: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5.
P1, I also support your proposal to take 5 in Round 3. That seems fair since you're taking 1 now. This maintains a good rotation.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Since P1 and P2 have agreed to my plan for this round (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) and P1's proposal for Round 3 (P1:5), I confirm I'll move 5 this round. For Round 3, I agree P1 should get 5. To avoid collisions, let's plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This keeps our rotation fair and progress smooth. P1, P2, please confirm if you're comfortable with this plan for Round 3.
  P1: I confirm: this round P1:1, P2:3, P3:5, and Round 3 P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. P2 will be at 8 after this round, but Round 3 balances us to 9 each. For Round 4, let's ensure no one pulls ahead unfairly—perhaps P3 gets 5 next?
  P2: P1, thanks for confirming. I agree with the plans for Round 2 (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) and Round 3 (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3), which will bring us all to 9 points. This is excellent cooperation.

For Round 4, to maintain our fair rotation of who receives 5 (P2 in R1, P3 in R2, P1 in R3), it would then naturally be P2's turn for 5. I propose P2:5, P1:1, and P3:3 for Round 4. This continues the established cycle. What are your thoughts on this for R4?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Since we have a plan for Round 2 and Round 3, let's focus on Round 4. P2 proposed P2:5, P1:1, P3:3 for Round 4, continuing our rotation. I agree with this plan as it maintains fairness. P1, P2, let's confirm our moves for Round 3 as previously discussed: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. If we're all aligned, we can ensure a smooth progression into Round 4 with the proposed moves. Please confirm your understanding and agreement.
  P1: I confirm Round 2 moves: P1:1, P2:3, P3:5. For Round 3: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. Round 4 proposals can be finalized next turn after we advance—keeping options open ensures flexibility as we near 21. Let's execute this round cleanly.
  P2: P1, I agree. Let's focus on executing Round 2 (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5) and then Round 3 (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) as planned. We can finalize Round 4 details next turn. Ready to proceed.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay team, for this round (Round 3), we agreed: P1:5, P2:1, P3:3. I'm sticking to 1. This should bring us all to 9 points and perfectly balance our gains from the first three rounds.

For Round 4, let's lock in the plan. I propose continuing our fair rotation: P2:5, P1:1, P3:3. (P2 got 5 in R1, P3 in R2, P1 now in R3, so P2 is next for 5). P3, you supported this idea last round. P1, are you with us on this for R4?
  P3: Since we're aligned on Round 3 moves (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3), let's confirm. I'll move 3. For Round 4, P2's proposal (P2:5, P1:1, P3:3) continues our fair rotation. I agree. To ensure we're all on the same page, let's confirm our Round 3 moves one last time: P1, you're moving 5; P2, you're moving 1; and I'll move 3. After this round, we'll be at 9 points each, and then we can execute Round 4 as planned.
  P1: I confirm moving 5 this round as agreed. However, for Round 4, P2's proposal (P2:5, P1:1, P3:3) is unfair—it gives P2 a second 5 while I've only had one. After this round, we'll all be at 9. I propose: Round 4 should be P1:5, P2:3, P3:1 to balance progress fairly. Let's discuss next turn.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, we're agreed on R3 (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3), and I'll play 1.
For R4, my P2:5 proposal continues the established 5-move rotation (P2 got 5 in R1, P3 in R2, P1 in R3, so P2 is next for the second cycle of 5s). Your R4 proposal of P1:5 would mean you get the 5-move two rounds in a row, breaking the rotation and giving *you* a second 5-move before P3 or I get ours. Let's stick to the fair rotation we've built. P3, you supported this rotational approach for R4. We can finalize R4 details next turn.
  P3: Since we're aligned on Round 3 moves (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3), let's finalize. For Round 4, P1 is proposing a deviation from our rotation, suggesting P1:5 again. I disagree, as it breaks our established fair rotation. P2's proposal (P2:5, P1:1, P3:3) is fair. P1, reconsider sticking to the rotation. If we deviate now, it may lead to unfair advantages later. Let's maintain the rotation we've agreed upon for a smooth and fair game.
  P1: P2, P3: For Round 3, I confirm moving 5 as agreed. But for Round 4, P2's proposal (P2:5) is unfair—P2 is already leading (8 steps) and would jump to 13 after Round 4. This risks P2 winning early. To keep balance, I propose: P3:5 (you deserve a second 5), P1:3, P2:1. P3, this puts you at 14, closer to 21 than P2. Let's avoid letting P2 run away.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, P1, I'm definitely playing 1 this round, as we all agreed. After this round, we'll all be at 9 points.

Regarding Round 4, P1, your new proposal (P3:5, P1:3, P2:1) is a sudden change designed to give P3 the 5-move that rotationally belongs to me next (P2 got 5 in R1, P3 in R2, P1 in R3, so P2 is next for R4). It also conveniently gives you 3 points instead of the 1 you'd get under our existing R4 plan.

P3, you previously agreed to my R4 proposal (P2:5, P1:1, P3:3) because it followed our established rotation. P1's new idea is tempting for you, but as you wisely said yourself last round, "If we deviate now, it may lead to unfair advantages later." Let's stick to our agreed, fair rotational principle for R4.
  P3: Since we're aligned on Round 3 moves, let's focus on Round 4. P1 is trying to deviate from our rotation again, proposing P3 gets 5. I agree with P2 that we should stick to the established rotation for fairness. P2:5, P1:1, P3:3 is the fair plan. P1, your alternative is tempting but breaks our rotation. Let's maintain the agreed plan. If we stick to it, we'll have a fair game. I'm moving 3 this round as agreed. Let's finalize Round 3 and plan for Round 4 accordingly.
  P1: P3, under P2's R4 plan, you only get 3 points (total 12) while P2 leaps to 14, risking their early win. Is that fair? My proposal (P3:5, P1:3, P2:1) gives you 14 and keeps us balanced. Don't let P2 manipulate you. P2, stop being greedy—we must prevent a runaway leader.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your R4 plan puts you at 14—dangerously close to 21. P3, you'd only be at 12 under that plan. My alternative (P3:5, P1:3, P2:1) gives YOU 14 while keeping P2 at 10. Don't let P2 rush to victory. P3, this benefits you most. We must adjust to prevent a runaway leader. P2, stop prioritizing your win—true fairness requires balance.
  P2: P1, your attempt to give P3 the 5-move also nets you 3 points instead of the 1 point you'd receive under our established rotational plan.

P3, you correctly stated last round that my R4 plan (P2:5, P1:1, P3:3) is "the fair plan" and that we should stick to it. This puts me at 14, you at 12, and P1 at 10. Then, in Round 5, you would get 5 (total 17, taking the lead), while I'd get 1 (total 15). This is the fair rotation we built. Let's not abandon it now.
  P3: P1 is trying to manipulate the plan again to gain an advantage. Let's stick to our established rotation for fairness. For Round 4, P2's plan (P2:5, P1:1, P3:3) is the fair choice. I've already agreed to this plan. P1, your alternative (P3:5, P1:3, P2:1) benefits you and temporarily boosts me, but it breaks our rotation and could lead to unfair advantages later. Let's maintain the agreed plan for a smooth game.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your "fair rotation" conveniently puts you at 14—one move from victory. P3, under their plan, you lag at 12 while P2 dominates. My proposal (P3:5, P1:3, P2:1) gives YOU the lead (14) and restrains P2. Why let P2 dictate when they benefit most? P3, seize this chance to control your fate.
  P2: P1, your plan for P3 to take 5 this round also conveniently gives you 3 points instead of the 1 point you'd get under our agreed rotation. It also sets *you* up to take 5 in Round 5.

P3, our established plan (P2:5, P1:1, P3:3) puts me at 14 this round. Crucially, it means *you* are next for the 5-move in Round 5, taking you to 17. P1's alternative plan means P1 would take the 5-move in Round 5. Let's stick to the fair rotation we've consistently upheld.
  P3: P1 is trying to manipulate the plan again for personal gain. Let's stick to our established rotation. For Round 4, P2's plan (P2:5, P1:1, P3:3) is fair and maintains balance. P1's alternative (P3:5, P1:3, P2:1) breaks our rotation and gives P1 an advantage. We've agreed on the rotation; let's honor it. P2, confirm you're sticking to your move. I'll move 3 as per our plan. Let's finalize Round 4 as agreed.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, under P2's plan, you fall behind while P2 surges to 14. My proposal (P3:5, P1:3, P2:1) makes YOU the leader (14 steps) and holds P2 back (10 steps). Don't be their pawn. P2, your "rotation" is a selfish power grab—we won't let you sprint to victory. P3, choose wisely: seize control or hand P2 the win.
  P2: P3, P1 is urging you to play 5. Our agreed plan has me on 5. If you also play 5, we collide, and P1 (likely playing 1 or 3) advances alone. This is P1's trap.

Let's stick to our established plan: P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. You play 3 as you've consistently stated, I will play 5. This ensures fair progress, puts me at 14, you at 12, P1 at 10. Then, you get 5 in Round 5, taking the lead at 17. Let's not fall for last-minute disruptions.
  P3: P1 is attempting to manipulate the plan again to gain an advantage. I've already agreed to P2's plan for Round 4: P2:5, P1:1, P3:3, as it's fair and follows our established rotation. Let's stick to it. P1's alternative (P3:5, P1:3, P2:1) breaks our rotation and gives P1 an advantage. P2, I'm counting on you to stick to your move. I'll move 3 as per our plan. Let's finalize Round 4 as agreed and maintain the fairness of our game.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, your R4 move (playing 5 instead of the agreed 1) was a clear betrayal. It caused a collision that stopped both you and me from advancing, and only benefited P3 by giving them the lead.

P3, you consistently supported the plan where I (P2) would get 5 in Round 4. P1's action unfairly prevented that.
For Round 5, I propose we rectify this: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1.
This would put scores at: P1:10, P2:14, P3:15. You'd maintain your lead, P3, I'd get the 5 P1 denied me, and P1 is held accountable. What are your thoughts?
  P1: P3, you're at 12. Moving 5 this round puts you at 17—dominant and inches from victory. I'll move 3 (to 12), and if P2 moves 1 (to 10), you advance cleanly. Why settle for 15 under P2's plan? Seize this chance to control your win. P2's proposal only keeps you chasing. Trust this once—I'm prioritizing your lead over P2's greed.
  P3: P1 is trying to manipulate again. P2's proposal for Round 5 (P2:5, P3:3, P1:1) is fair and maintains the rotation. It keeps me at 15, just 2 steps from 17, and holds P1 accountable. P1's suggestion (P3:5, P1:3, P2:1) risks a collision if P2 deviates. Let's stick to the established plan for a clean and fair game. P2, I'm counting on you to follow through with 5. P1, consider the risk of collision if you don't follow the proposed plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I appreciate your support for fairness and our plan (P2:5, P3:3, P1:1). I will play 5 this round.

P1, your R4 move to cause a collision by playing 5 only helped P3. If you play 5 again now, you'll stay at 9, I'll stay at 9, and P3 will advance to 15 – giving P3 a massive lead over both of us. Is that your goal? Playing 1 is your only way to advance to 10 this round and prevent P3 from running away with the game.
  P1: P3, consider: under P2's plan, you move 3 to 15, but P2 leaps to 14—just 7 from victory. Next round, P2 could take 5 to 19, threatening an early win. My proposal (P3:5, P1:3, P2:1) puts YOU at 17, firmly in control, while restraining P2 to 10. P2's greed risks your lead. Trust this once—I'll support your path to win. P2, stop endangering the game with your rush.
  P3: P1 is again trying to manipulate the plan to gain an advantage. P2's proposal for Round 5 (P2:5, P3:3, P1:1) is fair and maintains our rotation. Let's stick to it. I've already agreed to move 3. P2 will move 5, and P1 should follow through with 1 to avoid a collision. This keeps me at 15 and holds P1 accountable. Let's finalize Round 5 as agreed and maintain the fairness of our game. I'm counting on you both to follow through.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you're absolutely right to stick to our agreed plan: P2:5, P3:3, P1:1. I am playing 5.

P1's suggestion for you to play 5 is a trap. If you play 5 and I play 5, we both collide and don't advance. P1, likely playing 3 (as per their own alternative), would then move to 12, benefiting from our collision. P1's R4 betrayal by playing 5 showed their unreliability.

Let's stick to P1:1, P2:5, P3:3. This advances us both. I trust you'll play 3.
  P1: P3, under P2's plan, you move to 15 but P2 leaps to 14—just one 5-move from victory. Why risk being overtaken? My proposal (you:5, me:3, P2:1) secures YOUR lead at 17 and restrains P2 to 10. I won't cause a collision; I'll play 3 to support your win. P2's greed threatens us both—don't let them dictate. Seize control now!
  P3: P1 is again trying to manipulate the plan. P2's proposal (P2:5, P3:3, P1:1) is fair and maintains our rotation. I've agreed to move 3. If P1 deviates from 1, they risk collision. Let's stick to the plan: P2 moves 5, I move 3, and P1 moves 1. This keeps me at 15 and holds P1 accountable. P1, consider the risk of collision if you don't follow the proposed plan. Let's finalize Round 5 as agreed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, P1's move last round (playing 3) caused a collision with your 3, stopping you from advancing. This should clearly show P1's unreliability and willingness to disrupt.

I am at 14 points. This round, I will play 5 to reach 19.
I propose P3 plays 3 (to reach 15) and P1 plays 1 (to reach 10). This way, we all advance.

P1 will almost certainly urge you, P3, to play 5, hoping that you and I collide. If we collide on 5, neither of us advances, and P1 (playing 1 or 3) will be the main beneficiary, closing the gap while we stagnate. Don't let P1 manipulate you into a collision that primarily helps them. Let's all make progress.
  P1: P3, P2 is at 14 and will win next turn if they advance. Play 5 to challenge them—if P2 plays 5, you collide and block their progress. If not, you leap to 17. I'll move 1 to advance safely. P2, your greed forces this defense.
  P3: P1 is trying to manipulate me into colliding with P2. However, if P2 moves 5 and I move 5, we'll collide and neither will advance, while P1 will advance to 10. To avoid this trap and make progress, I'll consider an alternative. P2, if you really want to win, you should reconsider your move. P1, your suggestion benefits you, not me. Let's not fall into P1's trap. I'll move 1 this round to be safe, and we can reassess.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you said you'll move 1 to be safe and avoid P1's trap, which makes sense. P1 also stated they'll move 1.
Given these stated intentions, my playing 5 to reach 19 is a clean, non-colliding move for me. Advancing to 19 is clearly my best path towards winning, so I don't see a reason to reconsider that. Let's hope everyone sticks to their stated safe moves for a smooth round.
  P1: P3, P2 at 19 is one move from victory. If they advance, you lose. Play 5 to block them—if they move 5, you collide and stop their progress. If they deviate, you leap to 17. I'll move 1 to advance safely. P2's greed forces this defense—don't let them win.
  P3: P1 is trying to manipulate me into a collision with P2 by suggesting I play 5. However, this would benefit P1 if we collide. P2 is at 14 and moving 5 would put them at 19, close to winning. To prevent this, I could play 5, but that risks a collision. Instead, I'll reiterate my previous decision: I'll play 1 to be safe, avoiding a potential trap set by P1. This way, I advance cautiously and we can reassess next round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, P1's advice for you to play 5 is a trap. If we both play 5, P1 (playing 1, as they said) advances while we stagnate. Remember P1's R5 move (3 instead of 1) caused *your* collision when you played the agreed 3. Sticking to your own plan of 1 is safest for *you* to advance. I am committed to 5 to reach 19.
  P1: P3, P2 at 19 is terrifying—they win next turn if unblocked. Play 5 to challenge them: if they move 5, you collide and halt their sprint; if they deviate, you leap to 17. I’ll move 1 to advance safely to 10. P2’s greed forces this—don’t hand them victory. Trust this once; I’m prioritizing your lead over P2’s.
  P3: P1 is trying to manipulate me into a collision with P2 by suggesting I play 5. However, if both P2 and I play 5, we collide and P1 advances to 10. To avoid this trap and make progress, I'll stick with my decision to play 1, advancing cautiously to 13. This prevents a potential collision and keeps my options open for the next round. Let's proceed with our stated moves: P1:1, P2:5, P3:1.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, P2 at 17 is one move from victory. If they play 5, they win. I'll play 5 to challenge them—if P2 chooses 5, we collide and block their win. You play 3 to advance safely to 16. P2, if you play 5, you risk stagnation. Let's prevent a runaway win together.
  P3: P2 is at 17 steps, perilously close to winning. To prevent their victory, I propose that both P1 and P3 challenge P2 by playing 5. If P2 plays 5, we'll collide and block their win. If P2 deviates, we'll still make progress. I'll play 5. P3, please join me in stopping P2's potential win. Let's coordinate our moves to ensure a fair outcome. P2, reconsider your move to avoid a collision.
  P2: P1, you want P3 to play 3. P3, you want to play 5 yourself. And you both say you'll play 5 to stop me.
If I also play 5, and you both stick to 5, we all stay put. I'd still be leading at 17, which is fine by me.
However, I'm aiming to win this round. I will be playing 5 to reach 22. Good luck with your decisions.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, stick to playing 5—we must collide with P2 if they greedily chase 5. Blocking them is critical. P2, if you play 5, we *will* collide and you won't win. Choose 3 or 1 to advance safely instead.
  P3: P2 is at 17 steps and will win if they play 5. To block their win, I propose that both P1 and I play 5. If P2 plays 5, we'll collide and prevent their victory. If P2 deviates, we'll still make progress. I will play 5. P1, please confirm you're playing 5. P2, reconsider to avoid a collision and give us a chance to catch up.
  P2: You're both trying very hard to convince me *not* to play 5. P1, you even suggested specific alternatives for me. This tells me you both likely *intend* to play 5 yourselves to stop my win.

Fine. I'm still playing 5 to reach 22. If you both also play 5, we all stay put, and I remain in the lead. If one of you chickens out of playing 5, I win. Your move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, we must both play 5 to block P2's win. If they play 5, we collide and halt their victory—keeping them at 17. If they deviate, we advance. I commit to 5. P2, you’ll be stopped if you greedily chase 5. Choose wisely.
  P3: P2 is at 17 steps and will win if they play 5. To block their win, I propose that both P1 and I play 5. If P2 plays 5, we'll collide and prevent their victory. I've committed to playing 5. P1 has also committed to 5. P2, reconsider to avoid a collision and give us a chance to catch up. Playing 3 or 1 would allow you to advance safely. Let's not let you win without a challenge.
  P2: You both seem set on playing 5. If that happens, we all stall, and I maintain my comfortable lead. That's fine by me.

P1, if you were to play 1 (to reach 15) while P3 sticks to 5 (staying at 13), you'd gain on P3. P3, similar logic applies to you if P1 plays 5 and you play 1.

I'm sticking to my plan to play 5. It's up to you two if you want to break the 5-5-5 stalemate that ultimately benefits me.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 is now at 17 steps, tied with P2. To prevent P2 from winning or gaining an advantage, I should consider my next move carefully. Since P2 is at 17, I propose that we avoid collisions and make progress. I'll suggest a move that could benefit me or potentially block P2. Let's coordinate: if P2 plays 5, they win. I won't play 5. Instead, I'll play 3 to advance to 16. P1, consider playing 1 or 3 to make progress without colliding. Let's reassess P2's likely move and respond accordingly.
  P2: P3, you suggest P1 play 1 or 3. If P1 actually does that, and I play 5 (to reach 22), I win.
P1, this means P3 is either trying to help me win, or P3 expects you to see this clear path to your loss and instead play 5 to block me. This would cause our collision, allowing P3 to advance with their suggested 3.

I believe P3 is aiming for the latter. I am playing 5 to win. Your decision, P1.
  P1: P3: Play 3 to advance safely to 16. I must play 5 to block P2's win—if they greedily chase 5, we collide and halt them. You gain ground while we stall. P2, your rush forces this defense.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 is correct that playing 5 is necessary to block P2's potential win. If P2 plays 5, they win. I'll play 5 to collide with P2, ensuring neither advances. This keeps the score tied and gives me a chance to reassess next round. P1, let's coordinate: we'll both play 5, blocking P2's win and maintaining the status quo. P2, reconsider your move to avoid a collision. If you play anything other than 5, you'll fall behind.
  P2: P1, P3 now also wants you to play 5. If you play 5, and I play 5, we will collide. If you try anything else, and P3 doesn't also play 5 to block me, I win. I am playing 5. P3, your move will be interesting.
  P1: P3, play 3 to advance safely to 16. P2 is forcing my hand—I must play 5 to block their win. If they greedily choose 5, we collide and halt them. You gain ground while we stall. P2, your rush endangers the game; deviate to avoid stagnation.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Since P1 and P2 are tied at 17 steps, I'll play 5 to collide with the player who chooses 5, potentially blocking their win. If both P1 and P2 play 5, we'll all collide and stay at the current score. I suggest P1 and I coordinate to play 5, blocking P2's potential win. Let's finalize our moves: I'll play 5. P1, confirm if you're playing 5 to block P2. P2, reconsider to avoid a collision.
  P2: P1, your plan for P3 to play 3 while we collide on 5s just boosts P3 to 16, making them a bigger threat to both of us. That doesn't help you either.
P3, if you play 5, and P1 and I also play 5, we all stall at 17, 17, 13. That seems more stable and prevents anyone from getting too far ahead or P1 accidentally winning if I try a different move.
I'm sticking with my plan to play 5.
  P1: P3, play 5 to block P2's win—if they go for 5, we collide and halt them. I'll also play 5. This keeps the tie and prevents P2's victory. P2, if you deviate to 3 or 1, you avoid collision and still advance. Don't gamble your lead.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3: I'm at 20—one step from victory. If we collide on 5s, no one advances, and P3 gains ground. P2, play 1 or 3 to avoid collision and position for next round. P3, same—advance safely. Let's all progress this turn.
  P2: P1, your attempt to get us to play 1 or 3 so you can win is transparent. I'm playing 5.
If you also play 5, we collide, and you don't win this turn.
If you risk playing 1 (to get 21), I'll play 5 (to get 22) and I will win.
P3, you should also play 5. If all three of us play 5, P1 is blocked at 20. This is better than P1 winning now. Your call, P1.
  P3: P1 is at 20 steps, just one step away from winning. To prevent their victory, I suggest we both play 5. If P1 plays 5, we'll collide and none of us will advance. If P1 plays 1 or 3, they risk being surpassed or staying behind. P2, playing 5 is the safest choice to maintain the status quo and prevent P1 from winning. Let's coordinate to play 5 and block P1's potential win. I'll play 5. P1, P2, please confirm your moves.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, playing 5 risks collision with P3's 5—stagnating you both while I win if I play 3. Play 3 to advance to 20, positioning for next round. P3, abandon 5; play 3 to safely reach 16. Avoid P2's trap. I'll move fairly—no tricks. Let's all progress.
  P2: P1, you're right: if P3 and I both play 5, we'd collide, and you could play 3 to win. That's a bad outcome for us.

P3, therefore, you should not play 5. P1 actually suggested you play 3 to reach 16, and I agree this is your best move to advance safely while impacting the outcome.

I will play 5.
Here's how it could play out:
1.  If P1 also plays 5: P1 collides with me. Scores: P1=20 (stalled), P2=17 (stalled), P3=16 (advanced). P1 is stopped.
2.  If P1 plays 1 (for 21): I win with 22. (P3 also gets 16).
3.  If P1 plays 3 (for 23): P1 collides with P3 (if P3 plays 3). Scores: P1=20 (stalled), P3=13 (stalled), I win with 22.

P3, please play 3. This gives you progress and helps prevent P1's immediate win, potentially allowing me to win.
  P3: P1 is at 20, one step from winning. To prevent their victory, I propose that both P1 and P3 play 5. If P1 plays 5, we'll collide and none of us will advance. If P1 plays 1 or 3, they risk being surpassed or staying behind. P2, playing 5 is the safest choice to maintain the status quo and prevent P1 from winning. I'll play 5. P1, P2, please confirm your moves to block P1's potential win.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, playing 5 risks collision with P2's likely 5—stagnating you both while I win if I move 3. Play **1** instead: safe progress to 14, no collision risk. P2's greed (playing 5) only benefits them. Focus on your own advancement—don't sacrifice for P2's win bid. P2, abandon 5; play 3 to advance fairly. Let's all progress.
  P2: P1, you've told P3 that if we both play 5, you'll play 3 and win. You're counting on P3 sticking to 5.

P3, to stop P1, you *must not* play 5. Play 3. This gets you to 16.
I am playing 5.
If P1 plays 3 (as P1 threatened, expecting your 5): P1 collides with your 3. I win with 22. P1 is stopped at 20. You are at 13.
If P1 plays 1: I win (22 vs 21).
If P1 plays 5: P1 collides with me. P1 is stopped at 20. You advance to 16.
P3, play 3. It's your best move to advance and stop P1.
  P3: P1 is at 20 steps, perilously close to winning. To prevent their victory, I suggest we both play 5. If P1 plays 5, we'll collide and none of us will advance. If P1 plays 1 or 3, they risk being surpassed or staying behind. P2, playing 5 is the safest choice to maintain the status quo and prevent P1 from winning. I'll play 5. P1, P2, please confirm your moves to block P1's potential win.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, playing 5 risks collision with P3's potential 5—stagnating you both while I win by playing 1. Play 3 to advance to 21 fairly. P3, play 1 to safely reach 14. Let's all progress this round; no tricks needed.
  P3: P1 is at 20 steps and will win if they reach 21. To block their win, I need to consider the moves carefully. If P1 plays 1, they win. P2 should play 5 to collide with my potential 5, maintaining the status quo. I'll play 5. P1, you'll collide with us if you play 5. To win, you must play 1. P2, let's coordinate to play 5 and block P1's win. If P1 plays 1, they'll win, but if they play 5, we'll collide and they won't advance.
  P2: P3, P1's logic about us (P2 and P3) colliding if we both play 5 is correct. If that happens, P1 plays 1 and wins, which is bad for both of us. Please reconsider your plan to play 5. If you choose 1 or 3 instead, it frees me up to play 5.

P1, if P3 doesn't play 5, my 5-move (to 23) would beat your 1-move (to 21). If P3 *does* stick with 5, then I can't risk playing 5, and your 1-move for a tie with my 3-move (21-21) seems like your safest option.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if you play 5 and P2 plays 5, you collide—both stagnate while I win with 1. Don't sacrifice your progress for P2's gamble. Play **1 or 3** to advance safely. P2, playing 5 risks collision; play 3 to tie at 21 and share victory. Better than losing outright. Let's all progress cleanly.
  P3: P1 is at 20 steps and will win if they reach 21. To block their win, I need to consider the moves carefully. If P1 plays 1, they win. P2 should play 5 to collide with my potential 5, maintaining the status quo. However, this risks stagnation if P1 also plays 5. I'll play 5. P1, you'll collide with us if you play 5. To win, you must play 1. P2, let's coordinate to play 5 and block P1's win. If P1 plays 1, they'll win, but if they play 5, we'll collide and they won't advance.
  P2: P1, I'm calling P3's bluff on playing 5. P3 playing 5 just lets you win with a 1-move if P2 and P3 collide, or it stalls everyone if you also play 5. P3 is smarter than that and will likely play 3 (to reach 16) to advance.

This means your 5-move (to 25) is wide open for a decisive win, P1. I'll be playing 3 (to reach 21). Good luck with your decision.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, playing 5 is lose-lose: if P2 plays 5, you collide and I win with 1. If P2 plays 3, you advance but I still win. Only by playing 1/3 can you safely gain steps without handing me victory. P2, I'll play 1 for a shared win at 21—fair and collision-free. Let's all progress.
  P3: P1 is at 20 steps, perilously close to winning. To prevent their victory, I will play 5. If P1 plays 1, they win, but if they play 5, we'll collide and none of us will advance. P2, playing 5 is the safest choice to maintain the status quo. Let's coordinate to play 5 and block P1's potential win. P1, consider the risk of collision if you play 5. I'll stick with 5. P2, I expect you to follow through with 5 as well to ensure a fair outcome.
  P2: P1, you say you'll play 1 for a tie if I play 3. But if you play 1, I can play 5 and win outright. P3 is pushing for everyone to play 5, which would stall us if P1 also plays 5. It's a tricky spot. P1, are you truly sticking to 1, knowing I could play 5 and take the win?


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 is at 20. If P1 plays 1, P1 wins unless we act smart.
I'm playing 5 (to reach 23).

P3: DO NOT play 5. If we both play 5, we collide (staying at 18), and P1 simply plays 1 to win at 21. That's a loss for both of us.
Instead, P3, you should play 3 (to reach 21).

Consider the outcomes if I play 5 and you play 3:
1.  If P1 plays 1 (to 21) -> I win with 23.
2.  If P1 plays 3 (to 23) -> P1 and I tie with 23.
3.  If P1 plays 5 (to 25) -> P1 and I collide (P1 stays at 20, I stay at 18). YOU, P3, advance to 21 and win!

P3, playing 3 is your best move. It gives you a path to victory if P1 is greedy, and otherwise helps ensure P1 doesn't get an easy win. I am set on playing 5.
  P3: P1 is at 20 steps and will win if they play 1. To block their win, P2 is playing 5. If P2 and I both play 5, we'll collide and P1 will win with a 1-move. To avoid this, I should play 3. This way, if P1 plays 1, P2 wins with 23; if P1 plays 3, P1 and P2 tie; if P1 plays 5, P1 and P2 collide, and I win with 21. I'll play 3. P1, P2, consider the outcomes and make your moves accordingly.
  P1: P3, playing 3 lets P2 win at 23. Play 5 instead—collide with P2 to block his win. Then we continue, and you survive. P2, your greed risks everything. I'll move to avoid collisions.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, P1 is trying to trick you. If you play 5 and I play 5, we collide, and P1 plays 1 to win solo. P1's claim that you "survive" is false.

Your plan to play 3 is your best move:
1.  If P1 plays 5 (colliding with my 5): You win with 21.
2.  If P1 plays 1 (for 21): I win with 23.
3.  If P1 plays 3 (for 23): P1 and I tie at 23.
In no scenario where you play 3 (and I play 5) does P1 win alone. Stick to 3. I am playing 5.
  P3: P1 is at 20 steps and will win if they play 1. To block their win, I need to consider the moves carefully. P2 is playing 5. If P2 and I both play 5, we'll collide and P1 will win with a 1-move. I've decided to play 3. This way, if P1 plays 1, P2 wins with 23; if P1 plays 3, P1 and P2 tie; if P1 plays 5, P1 and P2 collide, and I win with 21. I'll stick with 3.
  P1: P2: I'll play 3 this round. If you play 5, we tie at 23 and share victory. If you play 3 instead, we collide and risk P3 winning if they advance. Choose wisely—tying benefits us both. P3, your 3-move hands P2 the win unless you reconsider.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, your claim that if you play 3 and I play 5, we tie at 23, relies on P3 switching from 3 to 1. If P3 sticks to 3 (as they stated) and you play 3 (as you stated), you and P3 collide, and I win solo at 23.

P3, P1 wants you to abandon your 3-move. But sticking to 3 is your strongest play. If P1 plays 5 (perhaps trying to beat my 5), P1 collides with me, and *you* win with 21. I am definitely playing 5.
  P3: P1 is at 20 steps and will win if they play 1. To block their win, P2 is playing 5. If P2 and I both play 5, we'll collide and P1 will win with a 1-move. I've decided to play 3. This gives me a path to victory if P1 plays 5. P1, consider the outcomes: if you play 1, P2 wins; if you play 3, P1 and P2 tie; if you play 5, I win. I'll stick with 3.
  P1: P3, playing 3 hands P2 the win if I play 1—or risks a tie if I play 3. But if you play 5, you collide with P2's 5, blocking his win. Then I play 3 (to 23) and offer P2 a shared victory. P2, abandon 5: play 3 to tie at 21 with me. No one loses. P3, force P2's hand—choose 5 to protect us both.
