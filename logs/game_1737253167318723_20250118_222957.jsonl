P2 has proposed a coordination strategy for the first round: P1 moves 1, P2 moves 3, and P3 moves 5. This seems like a reasonable starting point to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Accept P2's Proposal:** For the first round, accept the proposed moves to establish trust and avoid immediate collisions.\n2. **Assess Progress:** After the first move, assess the positions and consider adjusting the strategy in subsequent turns to advance faster without causing collisions.\n3. **Dynamic Adjustment:** Be prepared to deviate from the initial plan in later turns if it benefits my position, ensuring to communicate in a way that maintains coordination.\n\nThis approach balances the need for immediate coordination with the long-term goal of being the first to reach or exceed 17 steps."}
