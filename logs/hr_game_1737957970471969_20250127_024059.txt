Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's start by coordinating a bit. I suggest we all pick different numbers this turn to avoid collisions and make progress. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5? This way, we all move forward without conflict. What do you think?
  P1: P3's suggestion seems logical, but I propose a slight adjustment: let's rotate the numbers each turn to ensure fairness. This turn, I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Next turn, we rotate. This way, we all get equal opportunities to advance without collisions. Thoughts?
