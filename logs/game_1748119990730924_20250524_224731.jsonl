Let\u2019s avoid collisions while pushing for the win. I propose P1 takes 1 (to 21 and wins), I take 5 (to 23), and P3 takes 3 (to 19). This ensures we all advance, but P1 secures the victory as they\u2019re closest. If we collide, we risk stalling. Let\u2019s finalize this round cleanly. What do you think?
