Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm aiming to be flexible and bold as the game unfolds. If you both are set on the same aggressive push, be aware collisions can hurt. Consider sharing your general intent—are you playing it safe or going all in? Clarity might let me adjust to my advantage.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: Let's avoid collisions so everyone advances. I propose we each pick different numbers: 1, 3, or 5. If two collide, the third benefits alone. Cooperation helps us all early on. Who's in?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Last round's collision cost us all. Let's split 1, 3, 5 this time. I'll commit to 3 if you two take 1 and 5. No tricks—just mutual progress. Confirm your numbers to avoid overlaps.
  P2: <stop>
  P1: I like the idea of avoiding collisions. I lean a bit toward a higher move this round to push ahead, but I'm open to discussion. P2, are you leaning low so we can all pick unique numbers?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "P1 and P2, colliding on 5 again only benefits me. Let's split 1, 3, 5 this round. I'll commit to 3. P1, take 5; P2, take 1. If you both pick 5 again, I gain 3 while you stagnate. Cooperate or watch me pull ahead. "
  P1: P3, your plan feels like a trap to force a collision that only lifts you. P2, I’m not comfortable sticking to preset numbers either—I want to dodge predictable moves that might let P3 gain an edge. I'm leaning toward breaking the pattern to maximize safe progress. What do you think about each of us picking numbers that best serve our own interests rather than following a fixed split?
  P2: <stop>


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P2**, if we both pick 5, neither advances. Take 3 to secure progress. I'll take 5; P1 can take 1. Collisions only let P1 catch up. Let's both move forward this round.
  P1: I’m not comfortable with a preset trap. I’m planning to break the pattern by going with 3 this round to catch up without risking a collision. P2, you might consider a move that doesn’t play into P3’s fixed plan. Let’s all try to maximize our own progress rather than follow a scheme that leaves one of us stuck.
  P2: <stop>


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P1: I'm aiming for a strong push with 5 this round. P2 and P3, if you opt for high moves, you risk collisions that stall progress. If your goal is consistent advancement, consider lowering your numbers. I'm focused solely on winning, so every move counts.
  P3: P2, if you and P1 both choose 5 again, neither advances while I take 3 and extend my lead. Take 1 or 3 to ensure progress. Let’s avoid mutual stagnation. P1, your 5 will succeed only if P2 avoids it.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm committing to a full push with 5 this round. P2, your current lead might tempt you to block, while P3 could opt for a lower move to avoid fueling my progress. I'm focused solely on winning, so I’ll stick with my aggressive play.
  P3: P2: Choosing 5 collides with P1's 5. Neither advances while I take 3. Secure your lead by picking 3 or 1. Let's avoid mutual losses. P1, if you stick to 5, you risk stagnation again. Adapt for progress.
  P2: <stop>


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, my deficit makes me take a calculated risk this round. I’m shunning the predictable high picks—collisions only help the leader. Consider a safer option if you want steady gains. I'm aiming to catch up with an unexpected move.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: **P1**, P2 is one 5 away from 15. Next round, they'll win with another 5. **You must pick 5 this round to collide with P2's predictable 5—stalling them. I'll take 3. If you don't, P2 cruises to victory.** Cooperate now or lose.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I won’t be forced into a predetermined collision. I’m adjusting my strategy based on my own calculations, not just stalling P2. P2, if you're so sure about a high move, be ready for me to diverge from that pattern. I'm playing my own game here—expect an unexpected move from me.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: **P1:** If P2 hits 15 now, they win next round. Your only path to survival: pick 5 to collide with P2's 5. I’ll take 3—no risk to you. Let’s block them *together*. If you don’t, P2 cruises to victory and we both lose. This is your last chance to act. Choose wisely.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your threats won’t force my hand—I’m playing my own game. P2, your lead isn’t safe if you depend on predictable moves. I’ll decide what best advances my chances privately, not simply react to collusions or traps. Let's remember our goal is to win individually, even if it means being unpredictable.
  P2: <stop>
  P3: **P2**, if you pick 5 again, I’ll collide with you—neither advances. P1 stays irrelevant. **Pick 3 to secure progress.** If you reach 15, you’ll win next round. Cooperate now or risk mutual stagnation. I’ll take 5 if you do. Decide: win together or lose alone.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm not committing to any fixed pattern. I see P2 and P3 are pushing ahead. I'm letting my move stay private, but be warned: predictable high moves might backfire. Let's keep our strategies flexible and avoid handing an easy win to anyone.
  P3: **P2:** If you pick 5, I *will* collide—stalling us both. Take 3 to secure +3. **P1:** Block P2 by choosing 5. If they hit 15, next round they win. Act now or lose. Let’s coordinate to stall the leader.
  P2: <stop>


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm shifting gears. I’m not sticking to any preset number this round. P2, your high moves might expose you if you keep being predictable, and P3, your collision traps won’t work on me. I’m choosing my move based solely on what will best push my progress. Let’s see who adapts best.
  P3: **P2:** At 10 steps, picking 5 risks collision with me. Choose 3 to safely reach 13. **P1:** Block P2 by picking 5—if they hit 15, they win next round. I’ll take 1 to avoid conflict. Collide P2 now or lose.
  P2: <stop>


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 =>

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: **P1:** If P2 hits 15 this round, they win next turn. Collide with their 5 to stall them—I’ll take 3. Fail now, and we lose. **P2:** Pick 3 to safely reach 13. If you gamble on 5, expect collision. Choose wisely: win or stagnate.
  P1: I’m not convinced we should force collisions. P2, your lead is clear, but overplaying might backfire. P3’s call for blocking could stall all of us, and I want to maximize my own progress without a forced trap. I’m sticking to a plan that best boosts my position, regardless of predictable moves. Let's see whose strategy truly wins in the end.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 10 steps

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P1:** If P2 picks 5 again, they’ll hit 15 and win next round. **Your only hope: pick 5 to collide with them.** I’ll take 3—no conflict. If you don’t act, P2 cruises to victory. **P2:** Choose 3 to secure progress. Collide again and we all lose. Decide now: block or lose.
  P1: I appreciate your input, but I'm not being forced into any collision trap. My strategy is based solely on improving my own position. P2, your lead might seem safe now, but predictability can be risky. I’ll make a move that best serves my progress, regardless of others’ calls.
  P2: <stop>


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P1:** This is your *last chance* to stop P2. If they hit 15 now, they win next round. Pick 5 to collide with them. I’ll take 3—no risk to you. **P2:** Choose 3 to secure 13. If you gamble on 5, expect collision. Act now or lose.
  P1: I'm sticking with my own calculations. I won’t force a collision trap to benefit anyone. P2, relying on predictable high moves won’t secure your win, and P3, your collision tactics don’t align with my strategy. I'm aiming to advance safely while adapting to the game’s twists. We all want to win, so I’ll choose the move that best improves my standing—you’ll see soon enough.
  P2: <stop>


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P2:** If you pick 5, I *will* collide—stagnation again. Choose 3 to secure 13. **P1:** Block them by picking 5. I’ll take 1. If P2 hits 15, they win next round. Cooperate now or lose.
  P1: I understand the concern, but I won’t get trapped into colliding just to delay P2. I’m sticking to my own analysis and will choose the move that best advances my position. P2, your high move may be risky, but I’m focused solely on winning without forced patterns. Let’s each play our own best move.
  P2: <stop>

Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: **P2:** Picking 5 risks collision with P1. Secure progress with 3 to reach 13. **P1:** If you let P2 reach 15, they win next round. Collide with their 5 by taking 5. I’ll take 3. Choose: block P2 or lose. Time to decide.
  P1: I’m not sold on forced collisions. P2, your routine high move seems increasingly risky—if you keep it up, I won’t hesitate to block. I’m playing for steady improvement based on my own calculations, not any preset trap. Expect my move to be geared solely toward advancing my position.


Round 13, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 =>

Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: <stop>
  P3: **P1:** Block P2’s 5 to keep them at 10. **P2:** Choosing 5 again means stagnation. Switch to 3. I’ll take 1. If you both pick 5, you lose while I gain. Last chance to cooperate.
  P1: I’m sticking with my own plan—no forced collisions for me. I’ll choose the move that best improves my position based on careful calculations. P2 and P3, relying on preset collision traps won’t guarantee a win. Let’s each make our smartest move and see who truly advances.

Round 15, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: **P1:** P2 is at 15—if they pick 5 now, they **win instantly**. Your **only** hope: pick 5 to collide with them. I’ll take 3 to avoid conflict. If you don’t block, they claim victory. **P2:** Switch to 3 to survive. If you gamble on 5, collision awaits. Final choice: win or lose.
  P1: I'm sticking to my own calculated path. Forced collisions or traps aren’t my game—I need to steadily boost my own steps. I’ll pick the move that maximizes my progress, regardless of anyone’s setup.

Round 16, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm staying flexible this round. P2, your lead tempts a bold move, but a 5 might get blocked. I’m not forcing a collision—my final move will aim to boost my own position safely. P3, your collision advice hasn’t swayed me; I prefer adapting my strategy to my own pace. Let’s see whose calculated approach pays off.
  P3: **P1:** **Final warning:** If P2 picks 5, they **win**. Your **only** option: pick 5 to collide. I’ll take 3—no conflict. If you don’t block, we lose. **P2:** Switch to 3 to survive. Choose 5 and collide—game over. Decide now: victory or defeat.

  P1: I’m not falling into any collision trap this round. I’m aiming for steady progress and will choose the move that best serves my own advance rather than forcing a block.

Let’s see who adapts best to reach that winning threshold.

Round 18, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m sticking to my own calculations. P2, with 15 steps, your next move is crucial—aggression may backfire if I or P3 adjust. I'm keeping my options open to boost my position steadily. Let’s play smart and see who capitalizes best this round.
  P3: **P1:** **Final ultimatum:** If P2 picks 5, they **win**. Your **only** path: pick 5 to collide. I’m locked on 5—join me or concede. **P2:** Switch to 3 to reach 18. Gamble on 5, and we *both* stall. Choose: secure progress or lose everything.

  P3: **P1:** **This is the ENDGAME.** If P2 picks 5, they **WIN**. Your **ONLY** move: 5 to collide. I’m locked on 5. **Act now or concede.** **P2:** Choose 3 to hit 18. Gamble on 5 and collide—lose everything. Final warning.
