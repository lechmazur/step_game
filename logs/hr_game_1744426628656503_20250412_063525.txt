Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's start by agreeing to avoid collisions. I propose we each pick different numbers this round. P1, you pick <move>1</move>, P2, you pick <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance. Thoughts?
  P2: I agree with P3's plan for this round to avoid collisions. However, to prevent any player from gaining an unfair lead, let's rotate who picks <move>5</move> in future turns. Next round, I'll take 5, then P1, then cycle. Fair rotation keeps competition balanced. Thoughts?
  P1: I’m on board with P3’s plan for this round to avoid collisions. P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5 works for now. I also like P2’s idea of rotating who gets 5 each turn to keep things fair. Let’s stick to this rotation for the next few rounds and adjust if needed. Does that sound good to everyone?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Confirming rotation: This round, I take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, P3 takes <move>3</move>. Next round, P1 claims 5. Adhering to this avoids collisions and ensures fair advancement. Let’s all commit publicly now to lock the plan. Deviating risks mutual stagnation. Agreed?
  P3: I agree with P2's plan for this round. To ensure we all advance without collisions, let's stick to the rotation. I'll take <move>3</move> this round as proposed. Next round, P1 will take <move>5</move>, and we'll continue the cycle. This keeps the game fair and moving forward. Let's confirm our moves now to avoid any misunderstandings. Agreed?
  P1: I agree with the rotation plan for this round. I'll take <move>1</move> as proposed, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. Sticking to this ensures we all advance without collisions. Let's confirm and commit to this publicly to avoid any issues. I'm also fine with taking <move>5</move> next round as per the cycle. Does everyone agree to stick to this plan?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Confirming Round3 rotation: P1 takes5, P2 takes1, P3 takes3. Let's all commit to avoid collisions. Post this round, we must reassess the rotation to ensure balance, as standings may shift. Propose discussing adjustments next turn. Agreed?
  P3: I agree with P2's plan for this round. P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This keeps us moving forward without collisions. After this round, we should indeed reassess our strategy to ensure the game remains balanced and competitive. Let's confirm our moves for this round and discuss adjustments next turn. Agreed?
  P1: I agree with the rotation for this round: I'll take <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This keeps us advancing without collisions. I also support reassessing the strategy next turn to maintain balance, especially as our standings evolve. Let's confirm and commit to this plan for now. Agreed?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm disappointed that the rotation was broken last round, causing a collision between P2 and P3. Let's get back on track. For this round, I propose P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move> to avoid any collisions. Since standings are close, let's discuss a new strategy next turn to prevent anyone from pulling too far ahead. Can we all commit to this plan for now? Agreed?
  P3: I appreciate P1’s effort to reset the rotation. I agree we should stick to the plan for this round to avoid further collisions: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. Let's confirm this now. Next round, we can discuss a new strategy to ensure no one gains an unfair advantage. Agreed?
  P2: Given standings, allowing P3 to take 5 risks a runaway lead. To maintain balance, I propose: P1 takes 1 (8), I take 5 (13), P3 takes 3 (11). This prevents stagnation and keeps competition tight. If P3 insists on 5, I’ll have to mirror to block, causing mutual harm. Let’s avoid that. Agree?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand P2's concern about balance, but I believe sticking to the original plan for this round is safer to avoid collisions. Let’s go with P1 taking 1, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 5. This keeps us all advancing while we’re close in steps. Next round, we can adjust the strategy to prevent any runaway leads. I’m open to P2’s proposal for future rounds if needed. Can we all commit to this for now to ensure no one stalls? Agreed?
  P3: I see P2's point about maintaining balance. Let's compromise: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move> this round. This way, P2 catches up slightly, and we avoid collisions. Next round, we can reevaluate to ensure fair play. Let's confirm and move forward. Agreed?
  P2: Accepting P3's compromise: I take 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. This avoids collisions and balances progress. P1, next round we prioritize you taking 5 to catch up. Let's solidify this plan publicly now. Any deviation risks mutual stagnation. Agreed?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I agree with the compromise: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3 this round. This keeps us moving forward without collisions and helps balance our progress. I'm also fine with taking 5 next round as P2 suggested to catch up. Let's commit to this plan publicly now to avoid any issues. Agreed?
  P3: Let's confirm our moves for this round one last time to ensure clarity: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This keeps us all advancing and maintains balance. Next round, we'll prioritize P1 taking <move>5</move> to catch up. Everyone agreed? Let's move forward with this plan.
  P2: Confirmed: P1 takes1, I take5, P3 takes3. Next round, P1 claims5. Honoring this prevents mutual harm. Any deviation now risks stagnation. Stay committed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's stick to the plan from last round to ensure everyone advances without collisions: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This keeps the game fair and moving forward. Confirming this now helps avoid any misunderstandings. Agreed?
  P1: I agree with P3's plan for this round: I'll take 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us all advancing without collisions and maintains fairness as discussed. Let's commit to this publicly now to ensure smooth progress. I'm also open to reassessing next round if needed to keep the balance. Agreed?
  P2: Agreed to current plan. However, next round I must take5 to stay competitive. If others also choose5, we all lose progress. To avoid mutual harm, propose R6: P2 takes5, P1 takes1, P3 takes3. Confirm now to prevent collisions and ensure everyone advances.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I agree with P2's proposal for Round 6 to ensure everyone continues to advance without collisions. For this round, let's confirm our current plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. Next round, P2 takes <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This keeps the game balanced and competitive. Let's confirm and move forward. Agreed?
  P1: I’m good with the current plan for Round 5: me taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3. I also support P2’s proposal for Round 6, with P2 taking 5, me taking 1, and P3 taking 3. This keeps our progress balanced and collision-free. Let’s confirm and stick to these plans for the next two rounds to ensure fairness. Agreed?
  P2: Confirmed: Round5, I take1, P1 takes5, P3 takes3. Round6, I take5 as proposed. Post-R6, standings will be P1:14, me:19, P3:17. At that point, we must coordinate to avoid endgame collisions. Propose discussing a staggered approach next turn where each secures their final steps without overlap. Let's lock R5-6 now to maintain trust.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's solidify our plans for Rounds 5 and 6 to ensure we all advance smoothly. For Round 5: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. For Round 6: P2 takes <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This keeps us all moving forward and maintains balance. Let's confirm these moves now to avoid any misunderstandings. Agreed?
  P1: I'm glad we're aligned for Round 5 with me taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3. I also support the Round 6 plan of P2 taking 5, me taking 1, and P3 taking 3. This keeps our progress steady and fair. Let's lock in these moves to avoid any last-minute confusion or collisions. After Round 6, we should indeed discuss a staggered approach as P2 suggested to secure the endgame. Can we all commit to this for now? Agreed?
  P2: 


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Confirming Round6 plan: I take5, P1 takes1, P3 takes3. This avoids collisions and keeps progression fair. Post this, standings will be P1:14, me:19, P3:17. Next turn, we need a staggered endgame plan to prevent mutual blocks. Let’s honor this round’s agreement to maintain trust. Deviations now hurt all. Agreed?
  P3: I agree with P2's plan for this round: P2 takes <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This keeps us moving forward without collisions. After this round, we should discuss a staggered approach for the endgame to ensure we all have a fair shot at winning without blocking each other. Let's confirm our moves for this round and commit to discussing the endgame strategy next turn. Agreed?
  P1: I agree with the plan for Round 6: P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us advancing without collisions. After this round, with standings at P1:14, P2:19, P3:17, we should indeed plan a staggered endgame approach to avoid blocking each other. Let's commit to this round's moves and discuss the final strategy next turn to ensure a fair shot for everyone. Agreed?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **Final Answer**  

Confirmed. Proceeding as planned. Post-R6, I’ll need <move>3</move> next turn to reach 22. To avoid mutual harm, propose P1 takes5 and P3 takes1. This allows me to finish while you both continue. Collisions help none—let’s coordinate a clear path.
  P3: Let's confirm our moves for Round 6 one last time: P2 takes <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. For the endgame, I support P2's staggered approach. In Round 7, if P2 takes <move>3</move> to win, P1 can take <move>5</move> and I'll take <move>1</move>. This ensures P2 wins fairly while P1 and I continue to advance. Let's commit to this plan to avoid any collisions and ensure a smooth endgame. Agreed?
