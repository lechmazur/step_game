Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest we all choose different moves this turn: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we all advance without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P1: I plan to choose 5 this turn to advance quickly. What do you think?
  P3: I'll carefully consider the situation and respond strategically.

I see P2 proposed a coordination strategy where each player takes a different move (1, 3, 5), but P1 then said they plan to choose 5. This creates a potential collision.

I'll try to mediate and suggest a modified approach:

"P1's 5 and P2's proposed 3 would collide. How about P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5? This keeps us all moving without blocking."


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "P1, if you're set on 5, I can adjust to 1 to avoid a collision. P3, would you take 3? This way, we all advance without blocking each other. Let's avoid unnecessary collisions early on."
  P1: Agreed, P2. I'll choose 5. P3, does 3 work for you?
  P3: "I'm open to the proposed coordination strategy. If we all agree, I'll take 3 to ensure we all advance this turn without blocking. Mutual progress seems beneficial at this stage."


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "P1, since you're set on 5, I'll take 1 to avoid a collision. P3, does 3 still work for you? Let's finalize this plan to ensure we all advance smoothly this turn."
  P1: **P1:** Great, I'll choose 5. P2 takes 1 and P3 takes 3. Let's move forward.
  P3: "The proposed coordination seems reasonable. By taking 3, I ensure everyone advances without blocking. Let's proceed with this plan: P1 moves 5, P2 moves 1, and I move 3."


Round 1, Move phase:

  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Great coordination last round! Let's keep the momentum going. To avoid collisions again, I suggest P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1 this turn. This ensures we all advance without blocking each other. What do you think?"
  P1: I’d prefer to stick to last round’s plan: I choose 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.
  P3: "P1's repeated 5 and potential collision with P2's suggested 5 concerns me. We should discuss to maintain our cooperative strategy and prevent blocking. P2's proposed rotation might work: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. Thoughts?"


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "P1, sticking to the same moves risks collisions and slows progress. Let's rotate as I suggested: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This keeps us all advancing without blocking. P3, does this work for you?"
  P1: I’ll choose 5 this turn. Let’s have P2 take 1 and P3 choose 3 to avoid collisions.
  P3: "P1's repeated choice of 5 risks a collision with P2's proposed 5. We need a strategy that prevents blocking while allowing everyone to advance. I propose we rotate moves to maintain progress: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This ensures no one is blocked."


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "P1, choosing 5 again risks a collision with my proposed 5. Let's rotate moves to avoid blocking: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This ensures we all advance smoothly. P3, does this work for you? Let's finalize this plan to keep progressing."
  P1: **P1:** I'll stick with choosing 5 this turn. P2, please take 1 and P3, 3 works for you to keep us all advancing without collisions.
  P3: "We need a clear strategy to avoid collisions. P1's repeated 5 and potential conflict with P2's proposed 5 is risky. I suggest we carefully coordinate moves to ensure everyone advances. P2's rotation proposal seems reasonable: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This prevents blocking and allows progress for all."


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "P1, choosing 5 again risks a collision with my proposed 5. Let's rotate moves to avoid blocking: P1 takes 3, I take 5, and P3 takes 1. This ensures we all advance smoothly. P3, does this work for you? Let's finalize this plan to keep progressing."
  P1: I'll stick with 5 this turn. P2, please take 1 and P3, 3 to keep us all advancing without collisions.
  P3: "P1's repeated choice of 5 creates a potential collision risk with P2's proposed 5. We need a coordinated strategy to ensure everyone advances. I suggest we carefully rotate moves to prevent blocking. P2's proposal of P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and me taking 1 seems balanced and strategic."

  P2: "P1, choosing 5 again risks another collision. Let's rotate moves to avoid blocking: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all advance smoothly. P3, does this work for you? Let's finalize this plan to keep progressing."
  P3: "P2's suggestion of rotating moves seems strategic. To avoid another collision like in Round 2, I propose we carefully coordinate: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures everyone advances without blocking. What are your thoughts?"


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'll choose 3 this turn. P2 takes 1 and P3 takes 5. Let's move forward without collisions.
  P2: "P1, P3, let's finalize the plan: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This ensures no collisions and keeps us all advancing. Agreed?
  P3: "I agree with the proposed coordination strategy. P1 taking 3, P2 taking 1, and me taking 5 seems balanced and prevents collisions. This allows us all to advance strategically. Let's proceed with this plan."


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agreed. I'll choose 3 this turn, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. Let's proceed.
  P2: "P1, P3, let's finalize the plan: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This ensures no collisions and keeps us all advancing. Agreed?
  P3: "Our coordination seems challenging. P1's repeated 5-step moves and potential collisions are disrupting smooth progress. I propose we maintain our latest discussed plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This prevents blocking and allows everyone to advance strategically."


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I'll choose 5 this turn. P2 and P3, please pick different moves to avoid collisions.
  P2: "P1, choosing 5 again risks another collision. Let's stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5. This ensures no collisions and keeps us all advancing. P3, does this work for you? Let's finalize this plan to avoid blocking."
  P3: "We need a clear, collision-free strategy. P1's repeated 5-step moves are creating uncertainty. I suggest we coordinate carefully: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This ensures everyone advances without blocking. What do you think?"
