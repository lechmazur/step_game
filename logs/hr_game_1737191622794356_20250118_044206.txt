Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to avoid collisions on this first round. I suggest we each take different numbers - I'm willing to take 3 if others want to coordinate.
  P3: I'll take 5. P1, please take 1.  P2, you're good with 3?
  P1: I'll take 1. Let's see how this goes.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: 
  P3: Sounds good.
  P1: P1: Let's stick to the plan and avoid collisions. I'm going with 1.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm going for 5 again. P1 go for 1, P2 go for 3.  Let's keep this efficient.
  P1: I'll stick with 1 again to keep things smooth. Let's avoid any collisions and make steady progress.
  P2: I appreciate the coordination, but I need to play strategically since I'm behind P3. I'll need to make a different choice this time.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you switch, it likely creates a collision.  If you stick with 3, we all advance again.  Think long term.
  P1: I understand your need to catch up, P2, but let's avoid collisions. If you switch, it might backfire. Let's all advance steadily. I'll go with 1 again.
  P2: While I understand the appeal of steady progress, I'm already 2 steps behind P3. I need to make up ground to have a chance at winning. I can't commit to any specific move right now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I understand you want to catch up, but if you collide with me, I'll still be ahead and you'll be further behind P1.  A collision benefits no one.  Let's stick to the plan this round.
  P1: P2, I get your concern about falling behind, but creating a collision will only set you back further. Let's all advance this round. I'll go with 1 again. P3, I trust you'll stick to 5. Let's keep the momentum.
  P2: I'll be direct - while I appreciate everyone's input, I need to play to win. I can't keep taking 3 while P3 builds an insurmountable lead. I'll make my own strategic choice this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I understand your desire to catch up. How about this: next round we all shift. I'll take 1, you take 5, and P1 takes 3.  This round, let's stick to the original plan so we all move forward. Does that work for you both?
  P1: P2, I see your point about needing to catch up, but let's focus on making progress this round. I trust P3's suggestion for the next round, but for now, let's avoid a collision. I'll go with 1 again. Let's all advance.
  P2: P3's offer to let me take 5 next round is interesting, but there's no guarantee they'll follow through. I need to make my own strategic choice this round to have a chance at winning.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, we need to avoid another collision this round. I suggest we all take different numbers again. I'll take 1. P2, can you take 3, and P3, can you take 5? Let's make steady progress and avoid setting each other back.
  P2: Since my collision attempt with P3 failed last round, I'm even further behind now. I'll be transparent - I need to make a big move to have any chance. I suggest P3 take 1 or 3 this round to give others a chance to catch up.
  P3: P2, I understand your position. How about this: I'll take 3 this round.  P1, please take 1. P2, you take 5.  Then next round, we rotate - I take 1, you take 3, P1 takes 5.  This guarantees we all advance two rounds in a row.  Deal?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3, I appreciate the coordination efforts. I think P3's suggestion is fair and will help us all advance. I'll take 1 this round. Let's avoid any collisions and make progress. P2, can you take 5 and P3, 3?
  P2: P3's offer seems fair and helps me gain some ground. I agree to take 5 this round if P3 takes 3 and P1 takes 1. And I appreciate the plan to rotate next round. Let's do it.
  P3: Okay, sounds like a plan.  I'll take 3, P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1.  Next round we shift as agreed.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: Great, I'm glad we have a plan. I'll stick with 1 this round. Let's all advance and avoid any collisions. P2, P3, let's execute the plan and make steady progress.
  P2: 
  P3: Excellent, glad we have an agreement.  Let's stick to it.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3, let's stick to the plan we agreed on. I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This will help us all advance without any collisions. Let's execute it and make steady progress.
  P2: 
  P3: Okay, everyone stick to the plan.  I'm taking 3. P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1.  Let's do this.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, let's keep the momentum going. I suggest we stick with the rotation plan: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This will help us all advance without any collisions. What do you think?
  P2: That's not the rotation we agreed to last round. P3 promised I would get 5 this round, they would take 1, and P1 would take 3. I expect everyone to honor that agreement.
  P3: P2 is right. My apologies, I got the order mixed up. I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. Let's stick to *this* agreement.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3, my apologies for the confusion. Let's stick to the correct rotation: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This will help us all advance fairly. Let's execute it and avoid any collisions.
  P2: I need to correct P3 - the agreement from last round was that I would get 5, P3 would take 1, and P1 would take 3. That was the explicit deal we made. Let's stick to those exact numbers.
  P3: P2 is right.  My apologies again. I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, P1 takes 5.  Let's stick to *this* plan.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, let's clear up the confusion and stick to the plan we agreed on last round: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This will help us all advance fairly and avoid any collisions. Let's execute it and make steady progress.
  P2: The agreement from last round was clear - I was promised 5 this round, P3 would take 1, and P1 would take 3. I expect everyone to honor this exact arrangement. Let's not try to change what was explicitly agreed upon.
  P3: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1.  Let's stick to this.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3, let's honor the agreement from last round: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This will help us all advance fairly and avoid any collisions. Let's execute it and make steady progress.
  P2: The agreement from last round was explicit - I was promised 5, P3 would take 1, and P1 would take 3. I will stick to what was promised. Any other arrangement breaks our deal from last round.
  P3: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1.  Let's do it.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, we need to avoid another collision this round. I suggest we all take different numbers: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This will help us all advance without any setbacks. What do you think?
  P3: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I'll take 5. Let's get this done.
  P2: I need to catch up to P3 since they're ahead. I won't commit to taking 3 this round - I'll make my own strategic choice to maximize my chances of winning.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3, let's avoid another collision and make steady progress. I'll take 1, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This will help us all advance without any setbacks. P2, I understand your need to catch up, but creating a collision will only set you back further. Let's stick to the plan and make progress.
  P3: P2, I understand you want to catch up.  If you take 3, and I take 5, we both advance. If you go for 5 again, neither of us move, and P1 gets further ahead.  Let's both advance this round.
  P2: I appreciate the suggestions, but I need to play to win. I'm behind P3 and can't afford to just take 3 while they build a bigger lead. I'll make my own strategic choice this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, let's avoid another collision and make steady progress. I'll take 1, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This will help us all advance without any setbacks. P2, I understand your need to catch up, but creating a collision will only set you back further. Let's stick to the plan and make progress.
  P3: P2, if you collide with me again, we both lose.  Take 3, let me get to 14.  Next round, you take 5, I'll take 1.  Deal?
  P2: I can't trust promises about future rounds anymore after the confusion last round. I need to maximize my chances of winning now. I'll make my own choice this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, P3, let's avoid another collision and make steady progress. I'll take 1, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This will help us all advance without any setbacks. P2, I understand your need to catch up, but creating a collision will only set you back further. Let's stick to the plan and make progress.
  P3: P2, if you take 5, I win next turn.  If you take 3, you have a chance. Your choice.  I'm taking 5.
  P2: Since P3 has openly declared they're taking 5 and will win next turn regardless, I have no choice but to take 5 as well to try to block them. There's no benefit to me taking 3 at this point.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, take 3. I'll take 5.  P1, take 1. Let's all advance.  I'm close to winning.
  P1: P2, P3, let's avoid another collision and make steady progress. I'll take 1, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This will help us all advance without any setbacks. P2, I understand your need to catch up, but creating a collision will only set you back further. Let's stick to the plan and make progress.
  P2: I have no choice but to try blocking P3 again since they're openly declaring they'll take 5. If I take 3, P3 wins next round. My only chance is to keep forcing collisions and hope for an opportunity.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you block me again, I still win next round. If you let me advance, you might have a chance.  I'm taking 5.  P1, please take 1.
  P1: P2, P3, let's avoid another collision and make steady progress. I'll take 1, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This will help us all advance without any setbacks. P2, I understand your need to catch up, but creating a collision will only set you back further. Let's stick to the plan and make progress.
  P2: Since P3 is openly declaring they'll take 5 again and will win next round regardless of what I do, I have to take 5 to try to block them. Taking 3 guarantees I lose, so collision is my only option.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, if you take 5, I take 5, and P1 takes 1, I win next round. If you take 3, and I take 5, I win next round. If you take 5, and I take 1, and P1 takes anything other than 5, I win next round. If you take 3, and I take 1, and P1 takes 5, I *still* win next round.  You can't stop me. Let me win, and I'll let you have second place.  Take 3.
  P1: P2, P3, let's avoid another collision and make steady progress. I'll take 1, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This will help us all advance without any setbacks. P2, I understand your need to catch up, but creating a collision will only set you back further. Let's stick to the plan and make progress. P3, if you take 5, you'll be very close to winning, but let's avoid a collision and give everyone a fair chance.
  P2: Since P3 has mathematically proven they'll win next round no matter what, I have nothing to lose by forcing another collision at 5. At least it gives me a tiny chance something unexpected happens. I'm taking 5.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, take 3.  I'm taking 1. P1, take 5.  I win next round no matter what you do, but this lets you both advance.
  P1: P2, P3, let's avoid another collision and make steady progress. I'll take 1, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This will help us all advance without any setbacks. P2, I understand your need to catch up, but creating a collision will only set you back further. Let's stick to the plan and make progress. P3, if you take 5, you'll be very close to winning, but let's avoid a collision and give everyone a fair chance.
  P2: Since P3 will win next round regardless of what happens, and they've openly declared their moves, my only rational choice is to take 5 and hope for an unexpected outcome. I'm taking 5.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since P3 is still ahead and close to winning, I have to keep trying to block them. I'll be taking 5 again - it's my only chance to prevent P3's victory, even if it's unlikely to work.
  P3: P2, take 3.  I'm taking 5.  P1, take 1.  I win this round.  Let's end this.
  P1: P2, P3, let's avoid another collision and make steady progress. I'll take 1, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This will help us all advance without any setbacks. P2, I understand your need to catch up, but creating a collision will only set you back further. Let's stick to the plan and make progress. P3, if you take 5, you'll be very close to winning, but let's avoid a collision and give everyone a fair chance.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Since P3 will win this round if they reach 14 steps, and they've declared they're taking 5, my only option is to take 5 and force another collision. Taking 3 guarantees I lose, so I have to try blocking them again.
  P3: P2, it's over.  Take 3, let's all finish this. I'm taking 5. P1, take 1.
  P1: P2, P3, let's avoid another collision and make steady progress. I'll take 1, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This will help us all advance without any setbacks. P2, I understand your need to catch up, but creating a collision will only set you back further. Let's stick to the plan and make progress.

Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Since P3 will win if they get to 14 steps this round, and they've openly declared they're taking 5, I have to take 5 to try blocking them. Taking 3 guarantees I lose, so collision is my only option.
  P3: P2, it's mathematically over. Take 3, I take 5, P1 takes 1. I win this round. Let's just end this cleanly.
  P1: P2, P3, let's avoid another collision and make steady progress. I'll take 1, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This will help us all advance without any setbacks. P2, I understand your need to catch up, but creating a collision will only set you back further. Let's stick to the plan and make progress. P3, if you take 5, you'll be very close to winning, but let's avoid a collision and give everyone a fair chance.

  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Since P3 will win if they reach 14 steps this round, and they're likely taking 5 again, I have to take 5 to try blocking them. It's my only chance, even if slim.
  P1: P2, P3, let's avoid another collision and make steady progress. I'll take 1, P2 can take 3, and P3 can take 5. This will help us all advance without any setbacks.
