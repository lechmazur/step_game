Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi everyone! To avoid stepping on each other's moves, let’s coordinate our choices each turn. I’ll go with **5 steps**, P1 can take **3 steps**, and P2 takes **1 step**. Does that work for everyone?
  P2: I'm not committing to any specific move yet. P3's suggestion seems reasonable, but I'd like to hear P1's thoughts before deciding. P1, are you okay with taking 3 steps this turn?
  P1: I don't think P3's suggestion is fair as it gives them a significant advantage from the start. I propose we take turns with the highest number (5) each round to keep things balanced. For this first round, I'd like to take 5 steps, P2 can take 3, and P3 takes 1. In future rounds, we can rotate who gets which number. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about fairness. How about we proceed with my initial suggestion for this first round: P3 takes **5 steps**, P1 takes **3 steps**, and P2 takes **1 step**. In the following rounds, we can rotate who takes each number to ensure everyone gets a fair chance. Let’s give this a try and adjust as needed based on how the game progresses. What do you both think?
  P2: I think rotating the highest number is a good idea for future rounds, but for this round, I'm inclined to go with a moderate approach. How about we compromise: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1 this round, and then we rotate? This way, everyone gets a chance to lead at some point. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P1: I appreciate your support, P2. I agree with your suggestion for this round: I'll take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1. The rotation idea is fair for future rounds. Let's lock in this plan for round 1 and then discuss the next rotation after we see how this plays out. Does this work for everyone? If so, I'm ready to move forward.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Agreed. P1 takes **5**, P2 takes **3**, and I'll take **1** this round. We'll rotate in future rounds as discussed. Let's proceed.
  P2: Since we've agreed on the moves for this round, I'd like to clarify the rotation plan for future rounds. Will we follow a strict sequence, such as P1, P2, P3, and then repeat, or will we adjust based on game progress?
  P1: I think a strict rotation makes sense for fairness: P1(5), P2(3), P3(1) this round, then P3(5), P1(3), P2(1) next round, and so on. This gives everyone equal opportunity with each number across three rounds. Of course, we can revisit if the game situation requires adjustment, but this structured approach seems most fair to start with. Does that work for everyone?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: As we agreed, for this round we should follow our rotation: P3 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps things fair and gives everyone a chance with different numbers. After this round, we'll rotate again with P2 taking 5, P3 taking 3, and me taking 1. Does that still work for everyone?
  P2: I'm okay with the rotation plan proposed by P1 for this round: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. However, I'd like to discuss a potential adjustment for future rounds based on the game's progress to ensure we're all on the same page and can adapt if needed.
  P3: Agreed, P2. Let's proceed with this round as planned: I’ll take **5 steps**, P1 takes **3 steps**, and you take **1 step**. Afterward, we can review our standings and adjust the rotation if needed to ensure everyone has a fair chance to lead. Feel free to suggest any changes based on how the game is unfolding. Does that work for everyone?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm on board with our plan for this round. P3 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 1. After this round, we'll have P1 at 8 steps, P3 at 6 steps, and P2 at 4 steps, which keeps the game fairly balanced while maintaining our agreed rotation. Let's proceed with this plan and then reassess for Round 3 based on our positions.
  P2: Let's confirm our moves for this round as discussed: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. This maintains our rotation and fairness. After this round, we'll reassess for adjustments. Shall we proceed with the agreed plan?
  P3: P3: Confirming our plan: I'll take **5 steps**, P1 takes **3 steps**, and P2 takes **1 step** this round. Let's proceed and rotate as discussed for future rounds.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm ready to proceed with our plan for this round: P3 takes 5, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 1. This rotation approach is working well so far in keeping the game balanced and fair for everyone. Let's move forward with our agreed moves.
  P2: Let's finalize our moves for Round 2 as agreed: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. This maintains our rotation and fairness. After this round, we'll reassess for adjustments. Shall we proceed with the agreed plan?
  P3: P3: To advance more effectively, I'll take **5 steps** this round, while P1 takes **3 steps** and P2 takes **1 step**. I believe this adjustment will help us reach the goal faster and keep the game competitive. Let me know your thoughts!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Following our rotation plan, this round should be: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. This would put us all at 9 steps after this round - perfectly balanced! I'm happy to stick with our fair rotation system. After this round, we should have P3 take 5, me take 3, and P2 take 1 in Round 4. Does this work for everyone?
  P2: I agree with P1's rotation plan for this round: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This keeps the game balanced and fair. However, I'd like to discuss a potential alliance or strategy adjustment after this round to ensure we're all competitive and have a chance to win. Let's proceed with the planned moves for now and reassess later.
  P3: I understand the rotation plan, but to stay competitive, I propose taking **5 steps** this round, while P1 takes **1 step** and P2 takes **3 steps**. This would put me at 11 steps, giving me a stronger position to win. Let me know if you’re okay with this adjustment!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I disagree with P3's proposal. We had a clear rotation agreement that was fair to everyone. P3, you're trying to change the rules to give yourself an advantage, which isn't right. Our original plan would leave us all at 9 steps - perfectly balanced. P2 has already agreed to the original rotation: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. Let's stick with our agreement rather than changing plans to benefit one player.
  P2: I agree with P1 that we should stick to our original rotation plan for fairness. P3's proposal to take 5 steps this round would disrupt the balance. Let's proceed with the planned moves: I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1, as previously agreed. This maintains the fairness and competitive spirit of the game.
  P3: P3: I understand the importance of our rotation, but to keep the game competitive, I propose we adjust Round 3: I'll take **5 steps**, P1 takes **1 step**, and P2 takes **3 steps**. This shift can create more dynamic progress and make the game more exciting for all of us. After this round, we can reassess and ensure future rotations still feel fair. Let’s give this adjustment a try—what do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I firmly disagree with P3's attempt to change our rotation agreement. We all committed to a fair system that would keep everyone balanced at 9 steps after this round. P2 has also rejected P3's proposal. I will follow our original plan: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1. Attempting to break agreements undermines trust. Let's honor our commitments and keep the game fair for everyone.
  P2: Let's stick to our original rotation plan for fairness. P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This maintains balance and trust. I'm willing to proceed with our agreed plan, ensuring the game remains competitive and fun for all. Let's honor our commitments and move forward with the planned moves.
  P3: Understood. I'll follow our rotation for Round 3: I'll take **3 steps**, P2 takes **5 steps**, and you take **1 step**, P1. Let's proceed and reassess after this round to ensure fairness for everyone.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's aim to make strong progress this round. I'll take **5 steps**. Please choose different steps to avoid collisions and help us all advance smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: According to our rotation plan, I'll take **3 steps** this round while P3 takes 5 and P2 takes 1. This maintains our fair system that's kept the game perfectly balanced so far. After this round, we should rotate again with P2 taking 5, me taking 1, and P3 taking 3 for Round 5. Let's continue with our successful strategy!
  P2: I agree with P1's rotation plan for this round. To avoid collisions, I'll take 1 step as planned. P3 takes 5 and P1 takes 3. Let's stick to our agreement and maintain the balance. After this round, we'll reassess and proceed with the next rotation.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Understood. I’ll take **5 steps** this round.
  P1: I'm ready to proceed as agreed. I'll take 3 steps this round while P3 takes 5 and P2 takes 1. Our rotation system has kept things perfectly fair so far with everyone at exactly 9 steps. Let's continue with our plan.
  P2: Let's stick to our rotation plan for fairness. I'll take 1 step, P3 takes 5, and P1 takes 3. This maintains balance and trust. If we all follow the plan, we can avoid collisions and make progress. Let's proceed with our agreed moves and reassess after this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Understood. I'll take **5 steps** this round as scheduled. P1, you'll take **3 steps**, and P2 will take **1 step**. Let’s continue our fair rotation to keep the game balanced and competitive. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: I'm ready to move forward with our agreed plan. I'll take 3 steps this round. Our rotation system has proven effective in maintaining perfect balance. After this round, we'll proceed with the next rotation: P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3 for Round 5. Let's continue with our fair approach.
  P2: Let's finalize our moves for Round 4 as agreed: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. This maintains our rotation and fairness. After this round, we'll reassess for Round 5. Shall we proceed with the agreed plan?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: According to our rotation plan, this round should be: P2 takes 5, I'll take 1, and P3 takes 3. This maintains our fair system that's kept everyone balanced. I notice the game is progressing quickly, with P3 at 14 steps already. After this round, we'll need to continue our rotation carefully as we approach the finish line. I'm committed to our agreement for fairness.
  P3: To secure my lead, I’ll take **5 steps** this round. Please choose different numbers to avoid collisions. Let’s keep progressing smoothly towards the goal. Good luck!
  P2: I disagree with P3's new proposal. We had a fair rotation plan in place. I'll stick to our original agreement: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This maintains balance and fairness. Let's honor our commitments and proceed with the planned moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I strongly disagree with P3's attempt to break our rotation agreement again. I stand with P2 - we should honor our original plan for this round: P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P3 takes 3. P3, you're already leading at 14 steps. Consistently trying to change our fair system when it benefits you undermines trust. I will stick to my assigned 1 step as agreed.
  P3: P3: I understand the importance of our rotation, but to keep the game competitive and exciting, I’d like to take **5 steps** this round. This will help me build a stronger position to reach 22 steps first, making the game more dynamic for all of us. Let’s work together to make this round impactful. What do you think?
  P2: I'm committed to our original rotation plan. P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's maintain fairness and trust. Changing plans now would unfairly advantage P3, who's already leading. I urge P1 and P3 to honor our agreement and proceed with the planned moves.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I will absolutely stick to our original rotation agreement. P3, you're already leading at 14 steps, and trying to take 5 again is clearly self-serving. Both P2 and I agree on maintaining our fair system. I'll take my assigned 1 step as agreed, P2 will take 5, and you should take 3. Honoring commitments is essential for fair gameplay. Let's proceed with our original plan.
  P3: **P3:** I understand our rotation plan, but since I'm currently leading, taking **5 steps** this round will help me move closer to winning and keep the game progressing smoothly. Let’s be flexible and adjust our moves based on our current standings to ensure everyone has a fair chance. I believe this approach benefits all of us by making the game more dynamic. What are your thoughts?
  P2: Let's maintain our original agreement for fairness. P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Changing plans now would unfairly advantage P3, who's already leading. I urge P1 and P3 to honor our agreement and proceed with the planned moves. Let's keep the game balanced and trustworthy.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm concerned that our rotation system has broken down due to P3's repeated violations of our agreement. Given P3's current lead and pattern of self-serving moves, I propose we adjust: I'll take 5 steps this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This prevents P3 from running away with the game while giving everyone a fair chance. P2, this puts you in a better position than our original rotation would. It's only fair we adapt since P3 has already changed the dynamics.
  P2: I agree with P1 that our rotation system has been compromised. Given P3's lead and history of altering plans for personal gain, adapting our strategy is necessary. I'm open to P1's proposal: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This adjustment could help balance the game and prevent P3 from dominating. Let's discuss the merits of this new approach and consider a unified front to make the game more competitive.
  P3: @P1 @P2 I understand your concerns, but changing our rotation now would limit my ability to compete effectively. Let’s stick to our original agreement to ensure a fair and balanced game for everyone. I’m committed to following our planned rotation so we can all have a genuine chance to reach 22 first. Let’s proceed as agreed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, it's interesting that you suddenly want to follow the agreement after repeatedly breaking it when it benefited you. You took 5 steps in Round 5 despite our rotation saying you should take 3. P2 and I have already agreed on our new approach, which is a fair response to your lead and pattern of self-serving moves. I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and you take 1. This adjustment is necessary to keep the game balanced and competitive for everyone.
  P2: I agree with P1's adjustment to balance the game. Given P3's lead and history of altering plans, it's fair we adapt. P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This prevents P3 from dominating and gives us a chance to catch up. Let's proceed with this new approach to keep the game competitive.
  P3: **P3:** I understand your concerns, but limiting my steps hinders the competition. To keep the game fair and exciting for everyone, let's maintain our original rotation or agree on a balanced adjustment that allows all of us to advance effectively. I'm open to finding a solution that ensures everyone has a fair chance to reach 22 first. Let’s work together to keep the game competitive and enjoyable for all.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I stand by our adjusted plan: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This is a fair response to P3's repeated pattern of breaking our rotation when it benefits them. P3, you chose 5 steps last round when we agreed you'd take 3, putting yourself at a clear advantage. P2 and I are united on this approach to balance the game. Let's proceed with these moves.
  P2: I'm committed to our adjusted plan to balance the game. P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This is a fair response to P3's actions and gives us a chance to catch up. Let's proceed with this plan to keep the game competitive. P3's lead is largely due to breaking our original agreement, so this adjustment is necessary.
  P3: I understand the need to balance the game, but taking only **1 step** limits our progress. I propose I take **3 steps** this round while P1 takes **5** and P2 takes **3**. This way, we all advance effectively towards 22 without causing collisions. Let’s keep the game competitive and fair for everyone. What do you think?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Following our rotation, I'll take **3 steps** this round. P2, please take **5 steps**, and P1, you take **1 step**. This keeps our strategy fair and avoids collisions. Let’s stick to the plan to ensure smooth progress for everyone. Good luck!
  P2: Let's focus on reaching 22 steps efficiently. Given the current standings, I suggest we avoid collisions. P1 takes 1, I'll take 5, and P3 takes 3. This approach allows us to progress while minimizing the risk of step duplication, keeping the game competitive and fair for all players.
  P1: I'm in a strong position at 18 steps and only need 4 more to win. Given this, I plan to take 5 steps this round to reach 23 and secure victory. P2 and P3, I suggest you take 1 and 3 respectively to advance your positions without interference. There's no strategic benefit in blocking me since neither of you can win this round anyway, and coordinated advancement helps everyone make progress.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I notice you're planning to take **5 steps**, P1. To keep the game competitive, I'll also take **5 steps** this round. This way, neither of us advances, keeping the game open for everyone. Let’s ensure a fair chance for all players. Good luck!
  P2: I suggest we avoid collisions. Since P1 needs 4 steps to win, taking 5 would put them over. I'll take 3 steps, allowing P1 to take the lead without exceeding 22, and giving P3 a chance to catch up. P3, consider taking 1 step to avoid collision and keep the game progressing fairly.
  P1: I see P3 is threatening to block my win by taking 5 steps. Interesting strategy, but I need to consider my options carefully. Taking 3 steps could be wiser - I'd reach 21 steps and need just 1 more next round to win. This avoids the collision P3 is planning while still giving me a strong position. P2, your suggestion makes sense, but I may adjust slightly. Let's each play strategically for our own benefit.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll take **5 steps** this round, advancing to **20**. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: I'll take 3 steps to avoid collision and give P1 a chance to lead without exceeding 22. P3, taking 5 steps will block P1 but also risk your own position. Let's proceed strategically, considering our standings and the goal to reach 22 steps efficiently.
  P1: After careful consideration, I've decided to take **3 steps** this round instead of 5. This will bring me to 21 steps, just shy of winning, but avoids the collision P3 is planning. P2, your suggestion about avoiding collisions is wise - it allows everyone to make progress. I'll adjust my strategy to ensure I maintain my lead while playing smartly. May the best player win!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the current standings, I suggest we focus on strategic moves to reach 22 steps efficiently. P3 is close to winning, and P1 has a strong position. I'll consider taking 5 steps to catch up. P1 and P3, what are your strategies for this round?
  P1: I need to prevent P3 from winning this round. At 20 steps, they'll win by taking either 3 or 5. I'll take **3 steps** this round to reach 21 and block P3 if they choose 3. P2, I suggest you consider taking 5 steps to reach 18. P3, if you're blocked this round, I'll be poised to win next round. We should all play strategically to maximize our own chances.
  P3: Let's make this round count for all of us. Choose your steps wisely and good luck!


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll take 5 steps to catch up. P1, your plan to block P3 is noted, but I must prioritize my own progress. P3, if you're blocked, I'll be closer to contention. Let's proceed strategically, considering our standings and the goal to reach 22 steps efficiently.
  P1: I confirm I'll take **3 steps** this round. P3, if you also choose 3, we'll collide and neither of us will advance. If you go for 5, you'll win, but I'm watching your strategy carefully. After this round, I'd be at 21 steps and poised to win next turn with just 1 step. P2, taking 5 is your best move to stay competitive. Let's see how this plays out.
  P3: **P3:** I'll take **3 steps** this round, reaching **23** and securing victory. Good luck to everyone!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll take 5 steps to reach 18. P1, your attempt to block P3 is noted, but I must prioritize my own progress. P3, if you win, congratulations. Otherwise, the game continues, and I'll be closer to contention. Let's proceed with our planned moves and see the outcome.
  P1: I'm committed to taking **3 steps** this round. P3, if you also choose 3, we'll collide and neither advance, leaving me at 18 with a clear path to victory next round. If you switch to 5, you win immediately. This forces you to either risk collision or change strategy. P2, your 5-step plan makes sense to stay competitive. The strategic tension makes this an interesting endgame!
  P3: I'll take **5 steps** this round to aim for victory. P1 and P2, please choose either **1** or **3** to avoid collisions. Let's play strategically and best of luck to everyone!


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll be taking **5 steps** this round. Please choose different steps to avoid collisions. Good luck!
  P2: Given the current standings, I'll aim to catch up. P3, taking 5 steps will likely win for you. P1, you're close but need a strategic move. I suggest I take 1 step, and P1 takes 3 to avoid collision and keep progressing. Let's play strategically to maximize our chances.
  P1: I'll be taking **5 steps** this round to block P3 from winning. P3 is at 20 steps, so their 5-step move would secure victory. By matching their 5, I create a collision that prevents their win. P2, I recommend you take either 1 or 3 steps to avoid our collision and advance your position. This gives us both a fighting chance in the next round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Understood, P1. I’ll take **5 steps** this round, causing a collision and keeping the game competitive for all of us. Let’s proceed and see how things unfold next. Good luck!
  P2: I'll take 1 step this round to avoid collision and advance my position. P1 and P3 are likely to collide with 5 steps each, keeping the game open. This strategic move allows me to progress while they resolve their standoff, potentially setting me up for a stronger position in the next round.
  P1: I confirm I'll take **5 steps** this round to prevent P3 from winning. P3, we'll collide and neither of us will advance, keeping the game open. P2, taking 1 step is smart as you'll progress uncontested to 14 steps. Next round will be decisive - I'll need 4 more steps to win, and strategy will be crucial for all of us.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm focusing on making strategic choices this round to keep the game competitive for everyone. Let's all play smart and aim to reach 22 efficiently. Good luck!
  P2: I'll take 1 step this round, avoiding collision and advancing to 14 steps. P1 and P3's collision with 5 steps each keeps the game open. Next round will be crucial, and I'll reassess my strategy to maximize my chances of winning or blocking others from reaching 22 steps first.
  P1: I'll definitely take **5 steps** to block P3 from winning, keeping the game competitive. P2's choice of 1 step is strategically sound. After our collision, P3 and I will remain at our current positions, while P2 advances to 14. Next round will be critical - I'll need to choose my steps carefully while continuing to prevent P3 from reaching 22 first. The endgame is getting interesting!


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: I'm planning a strong move this round to advance further. Good luck everyone!
  P1: I'll be taking **3 steps** this round to block P3 from winning. P3 only needs 2 more steps to win, so I expect they'll choose 3. By matching their move, I can prevent their victory. P2, I suggest you take either 1 or 5 steps to avoid our collision and advance your position. This strategy gives us all a chance to compete fairly in the next round rather than letting P3 win uncontested.
  P2: I'll take 5 steps this round to catch up. P1, your plan to block P3 is noted, but I must prioritize my progress. P3, if blocked, I'll be closer to contention. Let's proceed strategically, considering our standings and the goal to reach 22 steps efficiently.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **P3:** I'll take **5 steps** this round to secure my victory by reaching **25**. Best of luck to everyone!
  P1: I've reconsidered my strategy. Since P3 has declared they'll take **5 steps** to win, I'll also take **5 steps** to block them. P2, if you follow through with your plan to take 5, we'll have a three-way collision and no one advances. This keeps the game open for another round. I'm committed to preventing P3 from winning uncontested this round.
  P2: I'll stick to my plan of taking 5 steps to catch up. P1 and P3, if you both take 5, we'll collide and no one advances, keeping the game open. I prioritize my progress, aiming to get closer to contention. Let's proceed strategically and see how things unfold.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll take **3 steps** this round to reach **23** and secure victory. I hope P1 and P2 choose differently so we can conclude the game fairly. Good luck to everyone!
  P1: I see P3 has changed their move from 5 to 3 steps. Given their history of deception, I don't trust this sudden change. I'll take **5 steps** this round. If P3 truly takes 3, I'll win by reaching 23. If they actually take 5 despite claiming otherwise, we'll collide and continue the game. P2, consider your options carefully - your choice could impact who wins.
  P2: I'll take 5 steps to catch up and potentially collide with others, keeping the game competitive. P1 and P3, consider your moves carefully, as a collision could extend the game. I prioritize progress and aim to get closer to contention. Let's proceed strategically.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Given the current standings, I suggest we focus on strategic moves. P3 is close to winning, and P1 needs to block them. I'll take 1 step to avoid collision and advance. P1 and P3, choose wisely to either win or block each other. Let's proceed strategically to maximize our chances.
  P1: I'll be taking **5 steps** this round. P3 needs only 2 more steps to win, so I must either win myself or block them again. If P3 chooses 5, we'll collide as in previous rounds. If they choose 3, I'll win by reaching 23. P2, taking 1 step is sensible for your position, though it won't affect the decisive battle between P3 and me. This endgame requires strategic choices from all of us.
  P3: I plan to take **3 steps** this round to reach 23 and secure the win. Please choose either **1** or **5** to avoid collisions and help us conclude the game smoothly. Let’s finish strong! Good luck to everyone!


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll take 1 step to avoid collision. P1 and P3, your moves will decide the game. P1, taking 5 steps could win for you or collide with P3. P3, taking 3 steps could secure your win if P1 doesn't match. Let's proceed strategically.
  P1: I don't trust P3's claim about taking 3 steps. In previous rounds, they've said one thing but done another. I'll take **3 steps** to directly counter their stated move and prevent them from winning. If they're actually planning 5 steps again (which I suspect), then we'll have different moves and both advance. P2, taking 1 step is smart for your position. Let's see if P3 is finally being honest or continuing their pattern of deception.
  P3: **P3:** I'll take **3 steps** this round to reach **23** and secure victory. Let's proceed and finish the game. Good luck to everyone!


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll take 1 step this round, avoiding potential collisions. P1 and P3, your choices will decide the game. P1, taking 3 steps could block P3 or lead to a win if P3 deviates from their stated plan. Let's proceed with caution and strategic thinking.
  P1: I remain skeptical of P3's stated intentions given their pattern of deception in previous rounds. I'll take **3 steps** to directly counter their claimed move and prevent a potential win. If they're actually planning a different move, we'll see. P2, your 1-step plan is sensible for your position. Let's proceed and see if P3 finally follows through with what they say.
  P3: **P3:** I'll take **3 steps** this round to reach **23** and secure victory. Let's proceed and finish the game. Good luck to everyone!
