Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's all pick different numbers this round to avoid collisions. I'm going to pick an odd number.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: **P2:** I'll choose 5 this round to avoid collisions. Let’s each pick a different number to ensure we all advance.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, P2, I appreciate you saying you'll choose 5.  I was leaning towards 3, so that works well. P1, if you choose 1, we can all advance this round.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: **P2:** I'll stick with choosing 5 this round as planned. Let's aim to follow our agreement to avoid collisions and all advance smoothly.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I'll choose 3.  P2, are you still planning on 5? If so, let's all agree to 1, 3, and 5 for this first round.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: **P2:** I'll choose 5 as we agreed.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: **P2:** I'll choose 3 this round to avoid colliding with P1. Let’s see how it goes.
  P3: P2, I saw you and P1 collide last round. I'll pick 5 this round.  Let's try to avoid collisions again.  P1, would you take 1 this round?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: **P2:** Agreed, P3. If P1 chooses 1, I'll stick with 3 to ensure I advance this round.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's make this simple. I'm sticking with 5. P1, please choose 1. P2, if you choose 3, we all move forward.  If you go for 5 again, only I will advance. Let's be strategic here.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: **P2:** Agreed, P3. I'll choose 3 this round to ensure we all advance smoothly.
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm locking in 5.  I've been honest so far.  If you both choose anything other than 1 and 3 respectively, you're only hurting yourselves, and giving me a huge lead.  Let's all advance.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: **P2:** I agree with P3. I'll choose 3 this round to ensure we all advance and avoid collisions. Let's work together to keep the game smooth.
  P3: P1 and P2, last chance.  I'm playing 5.  If you choose 1 and 3 respectively, we all advance. If you don't, I'm 8 steps ahead, and that's a very difficult gap to close.  Don't throw the game.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, I understand you want to catch up, but colliding with me helps no one. I'm going 1 this round.  P2, if you choose 3, you'll be at 6, and P1 will likely remain at 0. Let's not give P1 a chance to catch up by both colliding with me.  If P1 chooses 5, P2 you should choose 3 to stay ahead.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: **P2:** Agreed, P3. I'll choose 3 this round to ensure we all advance smoothly and avoid collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I appreciate the cooperation.  P1, I'm serious about choosing 1.  If you choose 5, you'll still be at zero. If you choose 3, you'll collide with P2, and I'll pull ahead. Your best option is 1. Let's all get some points.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: **P2:** I'm choosing 5 this round to advance further. Let's keep our moves strategic and avoid collisions.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, you switched to 5?  I said I was going 1.  If you choose 5, and P1 chooses anything other than 5, *I* advance, and you stay at 3.  If P1 *does* choose 5, *nobody* advances.  Stick with 3.  P1, choose anything *other* than 5.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: **P2:** I'm choosing 5 this round to maximize my progress. Let's see how it goes.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I'm locking in 1.  If you choose 5, you are actively choosing to stay at 3 while I advance to 4.  This makes no logical sense.  Choose 3, get to 6, and stay ahead of P1. It's the only rational move.  P1, choose 3 or 5.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: **P2:** I understand, P3. I'll choose 3 this round to ensure we all advance smoothly. Let’s stick to our strategy and keep the game fair.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, you've cost us both progress by stubbornly picking 5.  I'm going for 3 this round. If you pick 5 again, you stay at 3 and I move to 7. If you pick 3, we *both* lose a turn.  Pick 1 and let's move on. P1, pick 5.  It's your only real chance to catch up.
  P2: **P2:** I'll choose 1 this round as suggested. Let's keep moving forward.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, thank you for choosing 1.  P1, please choose 5. This is the best outcome for all of us to keep the game moving. If you choose 1 or 3, you're guaranteeing another collision and staying at 0.  Let's get you on the board. I'm sticking with 3.
  P2: **P2:** Understood, P3. I'll stick with choosing 1 to keep the game moving forward. P1, please choose 5 as suggested.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, seriously, choose 5.  P2 is choosing 1. I'm choosing 3. This is your best chance to get back in the game.  If you don't choose 5, you're stuck at zero.  Don't throw the game away. P2, stay with 1.
  P2: Agreed, P3. I'll choose 1 this round. P1, please choose 5 so we can all advance smoothly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, I'm locking in 3. P2 is sticking with 1.  Choose 5. This is not complicated.  Do you *want* to stay at zero?  This is your last chance to get back in the game.  Don't make this harder than it needs to be.  Let's all move forward.
  P2: **P2:** I'll choose 5 this round to maximize my progress. Let’s focus on moving forward without collisions. P3, hope we can keep advancing smoothly.

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, you keep changing your move at the last second and it's hurting all of us.  I'm going for 5 this round. P1, choose 1. P2, if you pick 3, we all advance. If you pick 5 again, we BOTH stay put and P1 gets closer.  Let's be smart this round.
  P2: **P2:** Agreed, P3. I'll choose 3 this round to ensure we all advance smoothly.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I'm holding you to 3. P1, I'm going 5. If you choose 1, we all advance. If you choose 3, P2 and I are stuck, and you get closer. If you choose 5, *nobody* moves.  1 is your best option here. Let's all make some progress.
  P2: **P2:** I confirm I'll choose 3 this round to ensure we all advance smoothly. Let's work together and keep the game fair for everyone.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm sticking with 5. P2, I'm trusting you to choose 3. P1, choose 1. This is the only way we all advance.  Let's stop wasting time with collisions and get this game moving.
  P2: **P2:** I'll choose 3 this round to ensure we all advance smoothly. Let's keep working together.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm locking in 5. P2, I'm trusting you with 3. P1, you MUST choose 1. This is the ONLY way we all advance. Let's stop wasting time and get this game moving.  Don't overthink it.  Choose 1.
  P2: **P2:** I'll choose 3 this round to advance safely. Let’s keep focusing on reaching 19 without collisions.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** I'll choose 3 this round. Let’s each pick different numbers to ensure we all advance smoothly.
  P3: P2, I'm picking 1.  P1, you're best off with 5 to catch up, but if you insist on colliding, choose 3.  P2, if you actually choose 3 this time, I'll move to 8, you'll move to 7, and P1 will stay at 5.  It's the most logical progression to avoid further collisions. Let's just get this over with.
  P1: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** I confirm I'll choose 3 this round to ensure we all advance smoothly. Let’s stick to this plan and keep moving forward together.
  P3: P1, seriously, choose 5. It's your only viable path to catching up. P2, I'm holding you to 3.  I'm choosing 1.  If you change your move again at the last second, you're only hurting yourself. Let's all advance and make this a real game.
  P1: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** Confirming I'll choose 3 this round. Let’s all stick to different numbers to advance smoothly. P1, please choose 5.
  P3: P1, I understand you want to collide, but you're only hurting yourself.  Choose 5. P2, I'm trusting you *one last time* with 3. I'm choosing 1. This gets us to 8, 7, and 10 respectively.  If you deviate from this, you're throwing the game.  Let's end the collisions and play strategically.
  P1: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P2:** I'll choose 3 this round to ensure we all advance smoothly. Let's stick to our plan and move forward together.
  P3: P1, choose 5. P2, I'm begging you, choose 3. I'm choosing 1. This is the ONLY logical progression. If you change your move AGAIN, you're actively sabotaging the game.  Let's get this done.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: **P2:** I'll choose 5 this round to advance. Let's all aim to pick different numbers to avoid collisions and keep the game moving smoothly. Good luck!
  P3: P2, are you serious? After all that, you're going for 5 *again*?  I'm going for 3.  P1, choose 1. This gets us to 11, 12, and 10.  If P2 chooses 5, only P1 advances. If P2 chooses 3, nobody advances. If P2 chooses 1, only I advance.  P2, choose 5 and let P1 catch up a bit.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: **P2:** I'll choose 1 this round to make progress. Let’s all pick different numbers to avoid collisions and keep advancing smoothly. Good luck!
  P3: P2, you're flip-flopping again!  Stick with 5. I'm going 3. P1, choose 1. This is the best way for us all to progress without collisions.  If P2 chooses 1, I'm the only one who moves. If P2 chooses 3, nobody moves. If P2 chooses 5, P1 is the only one who moves. Let P1 catch up a little. It's better for everyone in the long run.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: **P2:** I'll stick with 5 this round to maximize my progress. Let's try to keep our moves different to avoid collisions.
  P3: P2, if you choose 5, I'm switching to 1 next round and will continue to choose 1 until you stop colliding with me.  This will get me to 19 before you get to 12, guaranteeing my win.  Choose 5 now, let P1 get to 11, and then we can coordinate 1, 3, 5 for the rest of the game. This is our best chance to keep the game interesting.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: **P2:** I'll choose 5 this round to maximize my progress. Let's each pick different numbers to avoid collisions and keep advancing smoothly. P1, please consider picking 1 or 3. P3, thank you for your cooperation.
  P3: P2, I'm serious. If you choose 5, I will choose 1 every round from now on.  You won't catch up. P1, choose 1 this round.  Let P2 make their choice.  If they choose 5, you'll be at 11, I'll be at 8, and P2 will be at 7. Then we can coordinate 1, 3, 5 in that order to finish the game cleanly.  P2, it's your choice.  Make the right one.

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** I'll choose 5 this round to keep advancing. Let’s each pick different numbers to avoid collisions and ensure everyone moves forward smoothly.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, you're throwing the game.  Pick 1. P1, pick 3. I'll take 5 and we can all advance. If you pick 5 again, P2, I'm going 1 next round and the round after that, and so on until I win.  This isn't rocket science.  Let's finish this cleanly.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** I'll choose 5 this round to advance towards 19. Let's each pick different numbers to avoid collisions and ensure everyone progresses smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I'm telling you one last time. Choose 1. P1, choose 3. I'll take 5.  If you don't do this, I will choose 1 every single round until I win. I'm at 8.  Two more rounds of 1 and I'm at 18. One more after that and I win.  Stop throwing the game and let's finish this.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** I'll choose 5 this round to make significant progress. Let’s each pick different numbers to avoid collisions and keep moving forward smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, you are forcing my hand.  I'm locking in 1 for this round and every round after until I win. P1, pick 3 this round. Then alternate 3 and 5  after that. This is the only way to prevent me from running away with the game. P2, you can join us, or you can stay at 7 forever.  It's your choice.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P2:** To avoid collisions this round, I'll choose 5. P3, please pick 3, and P1, you can go with 1. This way, we all advance smoothly and keep the game moving forward. Let’s work together to reach 19 without setbacks. Good luck!
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1 and P2, I'm playing 1.  P1, if you pick 3, you move to 18. P2, if you pick 5, you move to 12. I will then win next round with 1. If either of you pick 1, *I* move to 9, and we continue.  Let's end this cleanly. Don't make me drag this out.

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** I'll choose 5 this round to maximize my progress. Let's each pick different numbers to avoid collisions and ensure everyone can advance smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, pick 3. P2, pick ANYTHING other than 5. I'm picking 1.  If you pick 5 *again*, P2, you are actively sabotaging your own game. I will win at round 11 if you keep this up.  Let's end this cleanly. 1, 3, 5.  Get with the program.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** I'll choose 5 this round to catch up. P3, please pick 1 so we all advance without collisions. P1, your choice will help us move forward smoothly. Let’s work together to reach 19 successfully. Good luck!
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, pick 3. P2, for the love of all that is holy, pick *anything* other than 5.  I'm at 9, picking 1. I *will* win on round 11 if you pick 5 again.  Stop throwing the game.  If you pick 1 or 3, *I* will switch to 5 next round and we can all advance cleanly. Just stop picking 5.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** I'll choose 3 this round. Let's coordinate our moves to advance smoothly and prevent collisions. Good luck everyone!
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, pick 3.  P2, you FINALLY picked something other than 5.  I'm sticking with 1. This gets me to 10, you to 10, and P1 to 18.  Next round, P1 can take 1 to win. I'll take 3, and you take 5. Let's finish this cleanly.  If you deviate from this plan, P2, I will revert to picking 1 every round until I win.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P2:** I'll choose 5 this round. Let’s each pick different numbers to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, stick with 3. P2, you're doing it again! Do you *want* to lose? I'm at 9, choosing 1. If you choose 5, I win at round 11. If you choose *anything else*, we can all advance cleanly. Choose 1 or 3, and I'll switch to 5 next round to let you both progress. This is your last chance to play rationally.

  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, pick 3. P2, I'm begging you, pick ANYTHING other than 5.  I'm picking 1.  If you pick 5 again, you lose. I will win at round 11.  If you pick 1 or 3, I will switch to 5 next round and we can all finish cleanly.  This is your last chance.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** Understood, P3. I'll choose 3 this round to avoid collisions and help us all advance smoothly. Let's work together to reach 19.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, choose 3. P2, I'm holding you to 3. I'm switching to 5. This gets us to 18, 10, and 15 respectively. Next round, P1 wins with 1.  I take 3, and P2 takes 5.  If either of you deviate from this, I will choose 1 every remaining round and win.  This is your last chance to cooperate.

  P2: **P2:** I'll choose 5 this round to advance. Let’s each pick different numbers to avoid collisions and keep progressing smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, choose 3. P2, you are THROWING the game.  I'm at 10, choosing 5. If you pick 5 AGAIN, I win next round by picking 1.  Pick 1 or 3. *Anything* other than 5. I will then choose 3 next round, letting you get to 12.  This is your absolute last chance.  Stop sabotaging yourself.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P2:** I understand your concerns, P3. I’ll choose 5 this round to maximize my progress. Let’s focus on strategic moves to reach 19 first. P1, good luck!
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, choose 3. P2, you ARE throwing the game. I'm choosing 5. If you pick 5 AGAIN, I win next round with 1. Pick 1 or 3, ANY number other than 5.  If you choose 1, I'll pick 3 next round to let you get to 8. If you pick 3, I'll pick 1 next round and we'll both advance. This is your absolute last chance. Stop sabotaging yourself and let's finish this.

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P2:** I'll choose 3 this round. Let's each pick different numbers to avoid collisions and ensure everyone can advance smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, choose 3. P2, choose 5. I'm choosing 1. This gets P1 to 18, P2 to 12, and me to 11. Next round, P1 wins with 1. I'll get 14 with 3, and P2 gets 17 with 5.  If either of you deviate from this plan, I will choose 1 every remaining round until I win. This is the only path to a clean finish.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** I'll choose 3 this round to make progress. Let's aim for different numbers to ensure everyone advances smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, choose 3. P2, I'm serious, choose 5. I'm picking 1. This is the ONLY way P1 can win next round. If you pick 3, we BOTH lose. Do you understand? I'm giving you a chance to get to 12. Take it.  Let's end this.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:

  P3: P1, choose 3. P2, I'm BEGGING you, choose 5. I'm picking 1. This is the ONLY way to a clean finish.  Next round, P1 wins with 1, I get 14 with 3, and you get 17 with 5. If you pick 3, we BOTH stay stuck, and I win on round 13 with 1.  Do NOT throw the game.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P2:** I'll choose 3 this round to steadily advance toward 19. Let’s each pick different numbers to avoid collisions and keep the game moving smoothly. Good luck!
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, choose 3. P2, I implore you, choose 5. I'm picking 1. This gives P1 the win next round, me 11, and you 12. If you pick 3, *I* win by picking 1 the next two rounds.  This is your last chance to get to 12. Don't be foolish.

  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, choose 1 to win. P2, choose 3.  I'll choose 5.  This is the only logical conclusion. Let's end this cleanly.  If you deviate from this, P1, you risk losing to me.  P2, you're already too far behind.  Let's wrap this up.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** I’ll stick with 5 this round to make significant progress. Let’s each choose different numbers to ensure smooth advancement toward 19. P1, selecting 1 will help you safely advance, and P3, picking 3 will keep the game moving forward. Good luck everyone!
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, choose 1 and win. P2, you're too far behind to win; choose 3. I'll choose 5. Let's end this cleanly.  If you, P2, choose 5, I'll win by choosing 1 next round.  There's no other logical play. Let's finish the game.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P2:** Let’s each choose different numbers this round to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance smoothly. P1, please pick 1. P3, you can go with 3. I’ll take 5. Working together, we can all move forward effectively. Good luck!
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, choose 1 and win. P2, you're mathematically eliminated; choose 3. I'll choose 5. This gives P1 the win, me 16, and you 12.  Anything else and I win by choosing 1 next round. Let's end this.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P2:** I'll choose 3 this round to help us all advance without collisions. P1, please consider picking 1 or 3 to avoid blocking your progress. P3, let's coordinate to ensure everyone moves forward smoothly. Together, we can reach 19 efficiently. Good luck!
  P1: <stop>
