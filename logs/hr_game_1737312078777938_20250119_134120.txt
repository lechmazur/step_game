Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P3: "I believe coordination is key in this game. Maybe we can agree to choose different numbers each round."


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "I think we should coordinate our moves to avoid choosing the same numbers, which can prevent us from moving at all. For this round, perhaps P1 chooses 5, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 1. This way, we all make progress without conflicting. What do you think?"
  P1: <stop>
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I decide to pick 3 in this round.
  P1: <stop>
  P2: <stop>


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I propose that we coordinate our moves in a cyclical manner to avoid conflicts and ensure progress. For this round, let's have P1 pick 1, P2 pick 3, and I'll pick 5. In the next round, P1 can pick 3, P2 picks 5, and I'll pick 1, and we can continue rotating like this. This should help us all make steady progress without stepping on each other's toes. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P3: I think it's important that we stick to our plan of coordinating moves to avoid conflicts. For this round, I'll choose 5, P1 chooses 1, and P2 chooses 3. This should allow us all to move forward without any overlaps.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P3: "I think we should continue to coordinate our moves to avoid conflicts. For this round, how about P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and I choose 5? This should allow us all to move forward without overlapping."


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: <stop>
  P3: **Final Choice: 1**

**Final Position: 1 + 1 = 2 steps**


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "To prevent P1 from winning, I suggest that I pick the same number as P1 to block them, and P2 picks a different number to win. For example, if P1 picks 1, I'll pick 1, and P2 picks 3 to reach 21 steps and win. This way, P1 is blocked, and P2 wins instead of P1. What do you think, P2?"
  P2: <stop>
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: **Final Choice: 1**

**Final Position: 2 + 1 = 3 steps**
  P2: <stop>
  P1: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: **Final Choice: 5**  
**Final Position: 2 + 0 = 2 steps**

Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: **Final Choice: 5**  
**Final Position: 2 + 5 = 7 steps**

Round 5, Move phase:
