Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's discuss our strategies. It might be beneficial for us to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. For instance, if one of us aims for a higher move while another goes for a lower one, we can progress without hindrance. What does everyone think? Should we agree on a plan for this turn?
  P3: I agree with P2. Coordination could be key to avoid collisions and make progress. How about we try a simple pattern: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I (P3) will take 5. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P1: "That sounds like a good plan for this round. Let's try it."


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Great! I'm glad we're on the same page. Just to confirm, I'll stick to the plan: I'll take 3 steps. P1, you take 1 step, and P3, you take 5 steps. This should help us all advance without any collisions. Let's execute this strategy and see how it works out! What do you think?
  P3: I think we should stick to the plan we agreed on. It’s a solid strategy for this round. I’ll go with 5 steps as we discussed. Let’s see how it goes and adjust if needed in the next rounds. Ready to move forward together!
  P1: Sounds good. Let's proceed with the agreed plan then.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great job in the last round, everyone! Now that we have a successful strategy, I suggest we stick to it for this round as well. If we continue with P1 taking 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5, we can keep advancing smoothly. However, if anyone wants to adjust their move, now's the time to discuss it. Let’s keep the momentum going! What do you all think?
  P1: "Yes, that worked well. Perhaps this round I could take 3 instead of 1? Just to make a bit more progress."
  P3: I think P1's suggestion is reasonable. If P1 takes 3 this round, I can adjust to 1 to avoid a collision. P2, you can still take 5 to keep the momentum. This way, we all make progress. What do you think? Let's keep the communication open and adjust as needed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the adjustments, P1 and P3. To recap, if P1 takes 3, I’ll stick with 5, and P3 can take 1. This way, we avoid collisions and maximize our progress. However, if anyone feels uncertain about this plan, now is a good time to voice that. Let’s keep the lines of communication open and ensure we’re all comfortable with the strategy moving forward. What do you think?
  P1: "Yes, that sounds good to me. So this round, I'll take 3, P2 will take 5, and P3 will take 1. Let's do it."
  P3: I'm on board with the adjusted plan. P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and I'll take 1. This should keep us moving forward without any collisions. Let's execute this plan and see how it goes. If it works well, we can continue with similar adjustments in future rounds to keep the game dynamic and avoid predictability. Ready to move!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm glad we're all aligned on the strategy! Just to confirm, I’ll take 5 steps this round as discussed. If we keep adjusting our moves like this, we can maintain our progress without colliding. However, I encourage everyone to think about future rounds too—if we keep using the same pattern, we might become predictable. Let’s keep the communication flowing! Ready to move forward with our plan for this round!
  P1: "
  P3: I think we should stick to the plan we agreed on for this round. P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and I'll take 1. This will keep us moving forward without any collisions. If we continue to communicate and adjust our moves, we can maintain our progress and avoid predictability. Let's execute this plan and see how it goes. Ready to move!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I appreciate the teamwork so far, but I want to suggest that we keep our options open for future rounds. While our current plan is solid, we might need to adjust to prevent predictability. For this round, I’ll stick to 5 as planned, but let’s consider varying our moves in the next round to keep each other guessing. It could give us an edge moving forward. What are your thoughts on that?
  P1: "Yes, let's stick to the agreed plan for this round: I'll take 3, P2 will take 5, and P3 will take 1. We can discuss future round strategies after this one."
  P3: I agree with P2. Let's stick to the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This will keep us moving forward without collisions. For future rounds, we can introduce more variability to keep things unpredictable. Let's focus on executing the plan for this round and then reassess. Ready to move!


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: I appreciate everyone's input on our strategy. Just to confirm, I’ll stick to my plan of taking 5 steps this round. However, I want to emphasize the importance of being adaptable in future rounds. If we continue to communicate openly, we can adjust our strategies to avoid predictability and maximize our chances of winning. Let’s execute our plan for this round and then discuss how we can keep things dynamic moving forward. Ready to move!
  P1: Okay, sounds like we're all set for this round then. Let's make these moves and we can definitely talk more about mixing things up for the next round after this one.
  P3: I think we should stick to the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This will keep us moving forward without any collisions. After this round, we can discuss more dynamic strategies to keep things unpredictable. Let's focus on executing the plan for now. Ready to move!


Round 2, Conversation subround 6:
  P2: I appreciate everyone's commitment to our strategy. However, I think we should consider shaking things up for the next round to avoid predictability. While our current plan is solid, it might be beneficial to introduce some variability in our moves moving forward. For now, let's execute our plan for this round, but I encourage everyone to think about how we can keep our strategies dynamic in the future. Ready to move!
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we're all set for this round then. Let's make our moves.
  P3: I think we should stick to the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This will keep us moving forward without any collisions.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let's stick with the same moves as last round for this one: I'll take 3, P2 will take 5, and P3 will take 1. After this round, we should definitely discuss how to mix things up to avoid being predictable."
  P2: I agree with P1's suggestion to stick to the same moves as last round: I'll take 5, P3 will take 1, and P1 will take 3. This consistency has worked well so far. However, I also want to emphasize the need to consider a more varied strategy for future rounds to keep everyone on their toes. Let's execute our plan for this round and then brainstorm some fresh ideas afterward. Ready to move!
  P3: I agree with sticking to the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This consistency has helped us avoid collisions and make steady progress. After this round, we should definitely discuss more dynamic strategies to keep things unpredictable and maintain our momentum. Ready to move!

Ready to move!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Sounds like we're all set for this round. After this, let's brainstorm some concrete ideas for varying our moves next round. Maybe we each suggest a different move for ourselves and see what combinations work?"
  P2: I think we should stick to our agreed moves for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This consistency has worked well so far, but I also want to emphasize that we need to think about varying our moves for the next round to avoid predictability. Maybe we can each suggest different moves next round to keep things fresh. Let’s execute our plan for this round first, and then we can brainstorm afterward! Ready to move!
  P3: I agree with P2's suggestion to introduce more variability in future rounds. For this round, let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. After this round, we can each suggest a different move for ourselves to keep things unpredictable. This will help us avoid becoming too predictable and maintain our momentum. Ready to move!


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, so we're all set for this round. For next round, instead of just suggesting individual moves, how about we each propose a full set of moves for all three of us? That way we can see different combinations and pick the best one.
  P2: I appreciate the discussion about varying our moves for future rounds. For this round, I agree we should stick to the plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. I believe this consistency will help us maintain our momentum. However, let’s definitely come up with a diverse set of moves for the next round, as that will keep us unpredictable and give us an edge. Ready to execute our plan for this round!
  P3: I think we should stick to the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I'll take 1. This will keep us moving forward without any collisions.

  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: As we head into Round 4, I think it’s important to consider a shift in our strategy to avoid predictability. Since P2 is quite close to winning, we might need to adjust our moves to ensure that we don't all end up colliding again. How about we each propose different moves for this round? This way, we can keep our positions dynamic and potentially block P2 from advancing too quickly. What do you think? Let's brainstorm some new combinations!
  P3: I agree with P2. We need to introduce more variability to avoid predictability and potentially block P2 from advancing too quickly. How about this: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I (P3) take 3. This way, we can keep our positions dynamic and make it harder for P2 to predict our moves. What do you think? Let's discuss and finalize a plan for this round. Ready to move!
  P1: Okay, I like that idea, P3. Taking 5 this round makes sense for me to catch up a bit. So, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Let's try that combination to mix things up and hopefully slow P2 down.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the suggestions, P1 and P3. I see the value in mixing things up this round to keep things unpredictable. However, I want to emphasize that I’m still aiming for a strong move to maintain my position. If we go with the proposed moves—P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1, and P3 taking 3—it could create a collision issue. How about we finalize our moves to ensure we all have a chance to progress? Let's make sure we’re aligned before we move! What do you think?
  P3: I understand P2's concern about potential collisions. How about we slightly adjust the moves: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I (P3) take 1. This should help us avoid collisions and keep things dynamic. P2, this way you still make progress, and P1 and I can catch up a bit. What do you think? Let's finalize this plan and move forward. Ready to move!
  P1: Okay, I'm good with that adjustment, P3. So this round it's P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1. Let's go with that.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I agree with the latest adjustment: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I (P3) take 1. This should help us avoid collisions while allowing us to advance. However, I want to remind everyone that we need to remain flexible in future rounds. If we can keep our strategies dynamic, we can better position ourselves for a win. Let’s execute this plan for Round 4 and then think about how we can mix things up in the next round. Ready to move forward!
  P3: I think we should stick to the plan we just agreed on: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I (P3) take 1. This will help us avoid collisions and keep things dynamic. P2, this way you still make progress, and P1 and I can catch up a bit. Let's execute this plan and see how it goes. Ready to move!
  P1: Okay, sounds like we're all set for this round then. Let's make these moves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I appreciate the collaboration so far, everyone! I believe the plan we've settled on—P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1—will help us avoid collisions and maintain our progress. However, let's keep in mind the importance of staying adaptable in future rounds. If we can introduce some variability next time, it could give us a strategic edge. For now, let's execute this plan and see how it plays out! Ready to move forward!
  P3: I agree with the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I (P3) take 1. This should help us avoid collisions and keep things dynamic. P2, this way you still make progress, and P1 and I can catch up a bit. Let's execute this plan and see how it goes. Ready to move!
