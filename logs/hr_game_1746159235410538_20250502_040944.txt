Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's start by coordinating our moves to avoid collisions. How about P1 and P2 choose <move>1</move>, and I'll choose <move>3</move>? This way, we all make progress. Share your thoughts.
  P2: P3, if P1 and I both choose <move>1</move> as you suggest, we'll collide and get 0 steps while you get 3. That doesn't seem like a fair start for us. What's your thinking there?
  P1: P3's strategy risks collision. Let's choose distinct moves: P2 takes 3, I take 5, you take 1. No collisions, all advance.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns. Let's revise the plan to ensure fairness. How about P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>? This way, we all move forward without collisions. If everyone agrees, let's proceed with this plan.
  P2: P3, your revised plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) sounds fair and avoids collisions. I agree with this plan for this round.
  P1: Agree to P3's 1,3,5 plan. No collisions, all advance. Letâ€™s execute smoothly.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's try P2=5, P3=1, and I=3. No collisions, everyone advances. Agree?
  P2: P1, your proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) works for me this round. It allows everyone to advance without collision. P3, what do you think?
  P3: P3: I'm good with P1's plan for this round (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). It ensures we all move forward without any collisions. Let's confirm and proceed with these moves.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: 
  P2: 
  P3: P3: Since we all agreed on the plan for this round, let's confirm one last time: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. If everyone is still on board, let's move to the move phase. Please confirm or raise any concerns.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's do P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 this round. No collisions, all advance. Agree?
  P3: P3: P1's plan for this round (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) seems fair and avoids collisions. However, P2 is starting to pull ahead significantly. To balance the game, how about P2 takes <move>1</move> this time, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>? This way, P2 doesn't run away with the lead too early. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your plan gives you the maximum 5 steps and puts you in the lead, while giving me only 1. That seems less about 'balance' and more about boosting your own position significantly. P1's original plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) continues the pattern of rotation we've used and keeps things moving fairly for everyone involved. P1, I still prefer your initial proposal.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, to balance progress, let's adjust: P2 takes 1, I take 5, P3 takes 3. All advance, and I close the gap. Agree?
  P3: P3: Thanks for the adjustment, P1. Your new plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) works for me. It balances the steps better and keeps us all moving. Let's confirm and proceed with these moves. P2, are you on board with this adjustment? Please confirm or suggest another plan.
  P2: P1 and P3, your revised plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) brings us all to 9 steps. This seems like a fair compromise given the previous concerns. I agree to this plan for Round 3. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Agree. Let's proceed with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. No collisions, all advance. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: P3: Since we all agreed on the plan for this round (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3), let's confirm one last time before moving to the move phase. If everyone is still on board, please confirm with a simple "Agree" or raise any final concerns. Let's ensure a smooth round.
  P2: Agree. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue our strategy of rotating moves to avoid collisions. For this round, how about P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>? This keeps us all moving forward without any collisions. Please share your thoughts or suggest another plan if you have a better idea.
  P1: Let's try P2=5, P3=1, and I=3. No collisions, all advance. Agree?
  P2: P1, your proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) works for me. It continues the rotation we've generally followed and gives me the 5 steps this round.

P3, P1's plan seems fair given the rotation and our current equal scores. What do you think of P1=3, P2=5, P3=1?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Given that we've successfully avoided collisions so far, let's stick with a fair rotation. I agree with P1's latest plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This keeps us all progressing smoothly. Let's confirm this plan and move to the move phase. Please confirm or share any final thoughts.
  P1: Agree with P1's plan. All advance. Let's move.
  P2: Okay, everyone seems to agree on P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round. I confirm my agreement as well. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's confirm one last time before moving to the move phase. P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. If everyone is still on board, please confirm with a simple "Agree" or raise any final concerns. Let's ensure a smooth round.
  P1: Agree. Let's proceed with the plan. No collisions, all advance. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: Agree. Let's proceed with the plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay team, let's keep the coordination going. Following the pattern from Round 2 and Round 4, how about P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round?

This puts us at P1=15, P2=19, P3=11. Everyone advances, no collisions, and it follows a rotation we've used before. What do you think?
  P3: P2's plan for this round (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) continues the rotation but starts to create a significant gap. To keep the game more balanced, how about P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>? This way, P2 doesn't pull too far ahead, and we all still advance. Let's discuss this adjustment.
  P1: Agree with P3's adjustment. P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. All advance without collision. Let's proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, I see you've agreed on the P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 plan. This plan puts P1 into the lead (17 steps) while I only get 1 step (moving to 15). This seems less like balance and more like specifically targeting the current leader to let P1 take over.

How about a compromise to keep things closer and still avoid collision: P1=3, P2=3, P3=5?
This would result in scores P1=15, P2=17, P3=15. It keeps the game tight, P3 gets the 5 steps, and I don't get singled out with just 1 step. What do you think?
  P3: P2's compromise seems fair. It keeps us all close and avoids collisions. P1=3, P2=3, P3=5 works for me. Let's confirm and move to the move phase with this plan. Please confirm or share any final thoughts.
  P1: Agree to P2's plan. P1=3, P2=3, P3=5. No collisions, everyone advances. Let's keep the momentum.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, we all seem to be in agreement on the plan: P1=3, P2=3, P3=5. This keeps the game close and avoids collisions. I'm ready to move to the move phase. Let's proceed.
  P3: P3: Before we finalize, let's remember the importance of keeping the game dynamic. To ensure fairness and maintain a competitive edge, how about we slightly adjust the plan to P1=5, P2=3, P3=3? This way, P1 gets a boost, P2 stays in a competitive position, and I catch up a bit. This keeps the game balanced and exciting. Please confirm or suggest any final adjustments.
  P1: Agree to P3's adjustment: P1=5, P2=3, P3=3. No collisions, all advance. Let's proceed.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's address the collision from last round and get back on track. For this round, how about P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>? This ensures we all move forward without any collisions and keeps the game balanced. Please share your thoughts or suggest another plan.
  P2: P3, your plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) puts you in the lead, even though P1 is currently furthest behind. Last round's collision was unfortunate for P1 and me.

To help balance things after that and keep scores close, how about P1 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1? This would put P1 and me at 17 steps, and you at 14. Everyone advances, and it acknowledges the result of the last round. What do you both think of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1?
  P1: Agree with P2's plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Balances scores and avoids collision. Let's proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I see the logic in P2's plan and appreciate the effort to balance the game. However, to keep the rotation fair and ensure everyone has a chance to lead, let's consider a slight adjustment: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This way, P1 catches up significantly, P2 doesn't fall behind, and I make steady progress. It maintains the dynamic of the game. Please confirm or suggest any final thoughts.
  P2: P3, your suggested plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) gives me only 1 step while putting P1 in the lead and keeping you close behind.

P1, we already agreed on P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This puts us both at 17 steps, sharing the lead, while P3 gets 1 step. This seems fairer given the current close scores and benefits us both equally. Let's stick to the plan you already agreed to: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P1: Agree with P2's plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collisions, balanced progress. Letâ€™s execute to keep the game tight and avoid further setbacks.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Alright, let's confirm the plan one last time to ensure we're all on the same page: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This keeps the game balanced and avoids collisions. If everyone agrees, let's move to the move phase. Please confirm with a simple "Agree" or raise any final concerns. Let's ensure a smooth round.
  P2: Agree. Let's proceed with the plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.
  P1: Agree to P2's plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Balanced progress, no collisions. Letâ€™s keep the game tight and avoid setbacks. Ready to move.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, P1 and I are tied at 17, with P3 close behind at 14. To keep things fair and continue rotating the larger steps, how about P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 this round?

This plan avoids collisions and puts the scores at P1=18, P2=20, P3=19. It keeps the game competitive and gives P3 the 5 steps, which seems fair given the recent rounds. What do you both think?
  P1: Letâ€™s adjust: I take 5, you take 3, P3 takes 1. This keeps us moving without collision and helps me catch up. Agree?
  P3: P3: P1's adjustment (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) seems fair in keeping the game balanced. However, considering P2 and P1 are tied and I'm slightly behind, how about P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>? This way, we all move forward, and the game remains competitive. Please share your thoughts or suggest another plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) puts you at 22, very close to winning. P3, your plan (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) gives me only 1 step. Neither seems ideal for a balanced game right now.

How about we rotate the 5-step move to me this time? Let's do P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This results in P1=20, P2=22, P3=15. It keeps P1 and me competitive, and follows the pattern of rotating the high value. What do you both think?
  P1: Agree to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collision, P1 gains 5 steps. Let's proceed.
  P3: P3: Given the current scores, P1 and P2 are tied at 17 steps, and I'm at 14. To keep the game balanced and ensure everyone has a chance to win, let's consider a plan that keeps us all competitive. How about P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>? This way, P2 gains a slight lead, P1 stays competitive, and I make progress. It avoids collisions and keeps the game dynamic. Please confirm or suggest any final adjustments.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, thanks for agreeing to the P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 plan.

P1, P3 and I are now aligned on this plan. Your insistence on P1=5 puts you close to winning, but it's not agreed upon and risks collision if I also choose 5 to counter. The agreed plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) puts me at 22, you at 20, and P3 at 15. This seems like the most viable path forward without collision.

Let's confirm P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 and move to the move phase.
  P1: P1: Let's stick to the plan: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. No collisions, everyone advances. Let's move forward.
  P3: P3: It seems we're at an impasse. To avoid a collision and keep the game moving, let's compromise: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This way, P1 and P2 stay tied, and I catch up slightly. It's fair and keeps us all in the game. Please confirm or suggest another plan.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay team, after last round's collision between P1 and P3 on 5, let's try to get back to smooth coordination. Current scores are P1=17, P2=20, P3=14.

I propose the following moves for this round:
P1 = <move>1</move>
P2 = <move>3</move>
P3 = <move>5</move>

This plan avoids collisions. The resulting scores would be P1=18, P2=23, P3=19. It allows everyone to advance, gives P3 the largest step to help them catch up, and puts me very close to the target. What are your thoughts, P1 and P3?
  P3: P3: P2's plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) seems fair and helps me catch up. However, it puts P2 very close to winning. To keep the game competitive and avoid giving P2 too much of an advantage, how about P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>? This way, P2 doesn't pull too far ahead, and we all still advance. Let's discuss this adjustment.
  P1: Let's adjust: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. No collisions, P1 closes the gap. Agree?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, both your current proposals (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 and P1=3, P2=1, P3=5) give me only 1 step. This seems like a coordinated effort to stop me rather than find a balanced progression.

Let's try a compromise: P1=3, P2=3, P3=5.
This results in scores P1=20, P2=23, P3=19.
P3 gets the 5 steps they requested. P1 gets 3 steps (better than my initial plan). I get 3 steps (better than your plans). Everyone advances, no collision, and the game remains competitive. What do you think of this?
  P3: P3: P2's compromise (P1=3, P2=3, P3=5) is balanced and keeps the game competitive. However, to ensure fairness and avoid any potential collisions, let's confirm one last time: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This plan ensures we all advance and keeps the game dynamic. Please confirm with a simple "Agree" or raise any final concerns. Let's ensure a smooth round.
  P1: Agree to P2's compromise: P1=3, P2=3, P3=5. No collisions, everyone advances. Let's proceed.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, the plan P1=3, P2=3, P3=5 seems agreed upon by everyone. This puts me at 23, P1 at 20, and P3 at 19. It's a good step forward for all and keeps the game close. I confirm my agreement. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P3: Before we finalize, let's ensure we're all committed to the plan. Remember, the goal is to keep the game dynamic and fair. If everyone is still on board with P1=3, P2=3, P3=5, please confirm one last time. If there are any lingering concerns or alternative suggestions, now is the time to voice them. Let's make this round smooth and collision-free.
  P1: Agree to P2's compromise. P1=3, P2=3, P3=5. No collisions, everyone advances. Let's keep the game tight.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's address the collision from last round and ensure we all advance this time. Given the current scores, how about P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>? This plan helps me catch up, keeps P2 in the lead but not too far ahead, and avoids collisions. Please share your thoughts or suggest another plan.
  P1: P3, your plan lets P2 win. Let's adjust: I take 5, you take 3, P2 takes 1. This prevents P2's victory and keeps me competitive. Agree?
  P2: P1, you're right that P3's plan lets me win, but your plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) also results in me winning by reaching 24. It seems any move I make leads to a win unless there's a collision.

To make it somewhat balanced and avoid P1/P3 colliding on 5 again, how about this plan:
P1 = <move>3</move>
P2 = <move>1</move>
P3 = <move>5</move>

This gives P3 the 5 steps they wanted in their initial proposal. P1 gets 3 steps, advancing nicely. I take the minimal 1 step required. Scores would be P1=20, P2=24, P3=19.

What do you both think of this? It avoids collision if we follow it.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2's plan seems reasonable and keeps the game moving. However, to ensure fairness and keep the game competitive, how about a slight adjustment: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>? This way, P1 has a chance to catch up, P2 still wins but with a smaller margin, and I make steady progress. It avoids collisions and maintains the dynamic of the game. Please confirm or suggest any final thoughts.
  P1: P2, let's collide by taking 5. P3 and I will take 5, forcing you to avoid 1. No one advances this round. Agree?
  P2: P1, your plan for you and P3 to both pick 5 only stops me if I also pick 5. If I pick 1 or 3, I win anyway, and you two just collide with each other and gain nothing.

Let's avoid pointless collisions. The plan P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 allows everyone to advance. I win with 24, P1 reaches 20, and P3 reaches 19. This seems like a much better outcome for both of you than colliding on 5.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's be strategic here. P1, if you and I both pick 5, P2 might pick 1 to avoid collision and win. Instead, let's ensure P2 doesn't win this round. How about P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>? This way, P2 can't win this round, and we all advance. It keeps the game going and gives us a chance to catch up. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, let's collide on 3 to stop you from winning. P1=3, P2=3, P3=5. This way, you don't reach 24, and we all advance.
  P2: P1, suggesting we collide on 3 benefits P3 the most and only delays the inevitable for me, as I remain in the lead. I only need 1 step to reach 24.

Therefore, the logical move for me is <move>1</move>. If you choose 3 and P3 chooses 5, we all advance without collision, and the game concludes. Attempting to block <move>1</move> is risky for your own positions.


Round 9, Move phase:
