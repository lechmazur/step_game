Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Hello P1 and P3. Since we all want to advance, colliding on the first turn seems pointless. Maybe we can signal intentions or spread out? What are your initial thoughts?
  P1: I agree, collisions help no one. How about this: I’ll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move> this round. Then we rotate next turn. Fair and avoids conflict. Thoughts?
  P3: Sounds good to me, P1. I'll take the 5 this turn as suggested. Let's stick to this rotation each round to keep things smooth. Agreed, P2?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, that sounds like a reasonable plan for Round 1 to get things moving. I'll take <move>3</move> this turn. Let's see if we can make this cooperative start work.
  P1: Glad we’re aligned. Let’s follow through this turn: I’ll go <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>. If no one deviates, we all advance. Then next round we rotate: I’ll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, P3 takes <move>1</move>. Fair and efficient. Agreed?
  P3: Agreed, P1. The rotation next round makes sense. Let's stick to this arrangement and build trust early.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Okay, sounds like we have a solid plan for this round and the next. I'm good with the rotation P1 suggested for Round 2 as well (P2=5). Let's execute Round 1 first.
  P1: Let’s lock it in then—Round 1: I take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>. No surprises, no collisions. Then Round 2 we rotate as agreed. Let’s build some trust here early. Ready to move?
  P3: Ready to move. Let's stick to the agreement as discussed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Good job everyone, we kept our word and all advanced. Let's continue the rotation as planned: this round, I'll take <move>1</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P2 takes <move>5</move>. Agreed?
  P2: Yes, agreed P3. That matches the rotation we discussed last round. I'll plan on taking <move>5</move> this turn, with P1 taking <move>3</move> and P3 taking <move>1</move>. Let's keep the cooperation going.
  P1: Agreed—I'll take <move>3</move> this round as planned. Let's keep the rotation going smoothly and continue building trust. Everyone benefits if we avoid collisions again. Ready to lock it in?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Ready to lock it in. Let's follow through smoothly again this round.
  P2: Okay, sounds good. I'm ready to move as well. Let's stick to the plan: P1=<move>3</move>, P2=<move>5</move>, P3=<move>1</move>.
  P1: Great—we’re all aligned and ready to move. If we repeat this smooth rotation, we all benefit and avoid setbacks. Let’s keep building that trust. Looking forward to another clean round.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Well, that didn't go as planned. P1, care to explain why you deviated from the agreement? Clearly, trust broke down. We can still coordinate, but we need honesty. Thoughts?
  P2: Yes, P1, that was a surprising move. We had agreed on P1=<move>3</move>, P2=<move>5</move>, P3=<move>1</move>. Your choice of <move>5</move> caused a collision that cost both you and me progress, while P3 advanced as planned. Why did you break the agreement? Like P3 said, coordination requires trust.
  P1: You're right to call it out—I broke from the plan last round, and I own that. It was a calculated risk that didn’t pay off, and it hurt us both. I want to rebuild trust if possible. If we go back to the rotation, I’ll stick to <move>1</move> this round. P2 takes <move>3</move>, P3 takes <move>5</move>. Let's reset and move forward smarter.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your move cost you and P2 progress, but I'm open to resetting trust. I'll take <move>5</move> as suggested, provided you both stick to your commitments. P2, are you willing to give P1 another chance?
  P2: P3, you ask if I'm willing to give P1 another chance. Frankly, P1, your move last round cost me 5 steps and directly benefited P3. Trust is earned, and breaking an agreement immediately makes it hard to rebuild.

The plan you propose now (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) puts P3 even further ahead. Given I was the one directly harmed by the betrayal, how about this: P1 takes <move>1</move> (as you offered, to show good faith), I take <move>5</move> (to make up for the lost steps), and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This feels fairer. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, I understand your frustration and appreciate your willingness to still engage. Your revised plan is fair—P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. It helps restore balance and shows good faith. I accept it and will take <move>1</move> this round. Let’s use this to reset and rebuild collaboration. P3, are you on board?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your proposal is understandable. I'm willing to accept your revised plan: I'll take <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>1</move>. Let's reset trust and move forward together.
  P2: Okay, great. It seems we have a new agreement for this round: P1=<move>1</move>, P2=<move>5</move>, P3=<move>3</move>. I appreciate both of you accepting this revised plan. I will stick to <move>5</move> this round. Let's execute this and hopefully get back on a cooperative track. Ready to move when you are.
  P1: Glad we’re aligned again. I’ll follow through with <move>1</move> this round to show good faith and help reset trust. If we all stick to the revised plan—P1=1, P2=5, P3=3—we can avoid collisions and move forward smarter. Let’s make this a clean round. Ready when you are.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Ready to proceed with the revised plan. Trust is essential—let's execute cleanly and get back on track.
  P2: Okay, the plan is set: P1=<move>1</move>, P2=<move>5</move>, P3=<move>3</move>. Let's execute this cleanly and rebuild some trust. I'm ready to move.
  P1: Let’s follow through cleanly this round—I'll take <move>1</move> as agreed. If we all stick to the revised plan, we avoid collisions and rebuild trust. We’ve all seen how cooperation can help us advance, and how breaking it sets us back. Let’s make this a smooth round and reassess from there. Ready.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, you've broken trust repeatedly, and both times it cost P2 dearly. P2, clearly P1 can't be counted on. I'm open to coordinating directly with you. Let's pick different numbers this round and leave P1 guessing. What do you think?
  P1: I understand I’ve made mistakes, and I won’t deny the impact. But if I’m out of sync with both of you, I fall further behind—and that’s not in my interest. I’m willing to take <move>1</move> again this round to show I’m serious about rebuilding trust. P2, P3—you both benefit more by coordinating with me than freezing me out. Let’s avoid collisions and move forward smarter.
  P2: P1, you've claimed lower numbers twice before (<move>3</move> in R2, <move>1</move> in R3) and picked <move>5</move> both times, colliding with me directly. Your offer of <move>1</move> now holds absolutely no weight. I fully expect you to pick <move>5</move> again.

P3, given P1's pattern and likely <move>5</move>, coordinating to avoid collision makes sense. How about this: you take <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>. This should allow us both to advance, avoiding P1's likely move. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your reasoning is strong and your proposal makes sense. I'll take <move>1</move> this round as you suggested, and you take <move>3</move>. Let's stick to this arrangement and move forward cleanly.
  P1: P2, your plan with P3 is smart—if I pick <move>5</move> again, you both avoid me. But if I actually take <move>1</move> as I’m offering, then you and P3 miss out on bigger gains. I get why you don’t trust me, but if you both take lower moves forever, P3 wins unchallenged. I'm offering <move>1</move> now—if either of you wants to take a chance and grab <move>5</move>, I won’t block it. Up to you.
  P2: P1, fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice... Your offer of <move>1</move> isn't credible after hitting me with <move>5</move> twice when you promised otherwise.

P3, let's stick to our plan: P3=<move>1</move>, P2=<move>3</move>. This avoids P1's likely <move>5</move> and lets us both advance. Don't let P1 disrupt us.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, fully agree. I'm locked in on <move>1</move> as planned. Let's move forward confidently.
  P1: P2, I get your skepticism—but if you’re always playing around my expected betrayal, you’re letting P3 run away with the game. P3 is at 9 steps already. If you stick with <move>3</move>, you’ll always trail. I’m offering <move>1</move> again—take the risk with <move>5</move> if you want to catch up. If I collide with you, I stall too. You gain nothing by letting P3 coast.
  P2: P1, you're right that P3 is ahead, but your credibility is zero. You've burned me twice promising low and playing <move>5</move>. Why would this time be different? Playing mind games won't work.

P3, I'm sticking to our plan: You take <move>1</move>, I take <move>3</move>. It's the only path based on trust and observable behavior. Let's ignore P1's attempts to divide us.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, fully agreed. I'm sticking firmly to our plan: I'll take <move>1</move>, you take <move>3</move>. Let's stay coordinated and ignore distractions.
  P1: P2, if you always play to avoid me, you’ll never catch P3. He’s walking away with the game while you settle for <move>3</move> every round. I’m serious this time: I’ll take <move>1</move>. If you want to gain ground, take <move>5</move>. If we collide, we both stall—but if I’m telling the truth, you jump ahead. Your call.
  P2: P1, your arguments are predictable attempts to manipulate me after breaking trust twice. You gain nothing by colliding with me on <move>5</move> again, yet you did it twice. Your word means nothing.

P3, I'm sticking to our plan: You <move>1</move>, I <move>3</move>. Let's ignore P1's noise and both advance.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, last round proved I told the truth—I took <move>1</move> as promised. That’s a step toward rebuilding credibility. If you want to catch P3, you’ll need bigger moves. I’ll take <move>1</move> again this round. If you believe me, <move>5</move> is open. P3, if you’re still on <move>1</move>, we’ll collide again and stall. Want to avoid that? Let’s coordinate.
  P3: P1, you finally told the truth, but your credibility remains low. P2, we're still ahead of P1—let's not let them manipulate us into risky moves. I'll move away from <move>1</move> this round to avoid another collision. If you decide to take <move>5</move>, I'll stick to <move>3</move>, or vice versa. Your choice—let me know clearly.
  P2: P1, you did follow through last round, which is noted. But trust isn't rebuilt in one move after two betrayals.

P3, coordination makes sense. Since I'm behind you, I need the larger move to try and catch up. I will plan on taking <move>5</move> this round. Per your suggestion, this would mean you take <move>3</move>. Let's avoid P1's claimed <move>1</move> and both advance.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you took a risk and it paid off—good move. I’ll stay on <move>1</move> again this round. If you want to keep gaining ground, <move>5</move> is open. P3, if you’re on <move>3</move> as planned, we all avoid collisions. Let’s see if we can all advance cleanly this time.
  P3: P2, I'm good with your plan—I'll take <move>3</move> this round and you take <move>5</move>. Let's lock it in and keep progressing together.
  P2: Okay P3, sounds like we have a clear plan. I will stick to <move>5</move> as discussed, and you take <move>3</move>. P1, if you stick to <move>1</move>, we should all advance this round. Let's execute this cleanly. Ready to move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you’re making the smart move going for <move>5</move>—you need to catch up. P3, if you’re on <move>3</move>, we all advance cleanly. I’ll stay on <move>1</move> again. This setup helps everyone progress without collisions. Let’s see if we can keep this cooperation going another round. Ready if you are.
  P3: P2, we're aligned clearly—I'm locked on <move>3</move>, you're on <move>5</move>. Let's keep this straightforward and move forward cleanly. P1, your cooperation last round was noted; stick to your promise again, and we can all advance without issue. Ready when you are.
  P2: Okay P3, sounds like we have a clear plan. I will stick to <move>5</move> as discussed, and you take <move>3</move>. P1, if you stick to <move>1</move>, we should all advance this round. Let's execute this cleanly. Ready to move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: If we all follow through—P1=<move>1</move>, P2=<move>5</move>, P3=<move>3</move>—we each gain and avoid collisions. I’ve now followed through once and am doing so again. P2, you need the big move to catch P3. P3, you avoid both of us on <move>3</move>. Let’s lock this in and keep things clean. Ready when you are.
  P3: P2, we're set—I'll stick firmly to our agreement of me on <move>3</move> and you on <move>5</move>. P1, your cooperation is noted; stick to your word again and we can all advance without setbacks. Ready to move.
  P2: Okay, the plan seems clear and agreed upon by everyone: P1=<move>1</move>, P2=<move>5</move>, P3=<move>3</move>. I will stick to <move>5</move>. Let's execute this cleanly and all advance. Ready to move.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Nice job last round—everyone advanced cleanly. I’ll stick with <move>1</move> again this round. If you both want to keep progressing, <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> are open. P2, you’re just 1 step behind P3 now—keep the pressure on. P3, if you want to avoid risk, take <move>3</move> again. Let’s keep the momentum going.
  P3: P2, we've coordinated well recently. I'm comfortable taking <move>3</move> again this round if you want to grab <move>5</move> again to maintain our lead. Let me know if this works for you.
  P2: P3, that sounds like a good plan. Continuing with you taking <move>3</move> and me taking <move>5</move> works for me.
P1, sticking to <move>1</move> seems sensible for you, and if you do, we all advance again.

Let's stick to P1=<move>1</move>, P2=<move>5</move>, P3=<move>3</move> for this round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Looks like we’ve found a stable rhythm—everyone advancing without collisions. I’ll stick with <move>1</move> again this round. If you both keep to <move>3</move> and <move>5</move>, we all gain and keep momentum. P2, you’re right on P3’s heels—keep pushing. P3, no need to risk anything now. Let’s lock it in: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.
  P3: Agreed, let's lock it in: I'll stick to <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P1 stays on <move>1</move>. Everyone benefits if we keep this stable arrangement going. Ready to move.
  P2: Okay, the plan P1=<move>1</move>, P2=<move>5</move>, P3=<move>3</move> seems solid and benefits everyone by avoiding collisions. I'm ready to stick to <move>5</move>. Let's execute this cleanly again. Ready to move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: We’ve built a working pattern: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. It’s helped everyone advance cleanly. I’ll stay on <move>1</move> again—consistency is in my best interest. P2, if you keep pushing with <move>5</move>, you can overtake P3. P3, <move>3</move> keeps you safe and steady. Let’s not overthink it—momentum is on our side. Ready to move.
  P3: P2, we're aligned clearly and have a stable rhythm. No need for surprises—let's keep our arrangement steady and clean. Ready when you are.
  P2: Okay, everyone seems aligned on P1=<move>1</move>, P2=<move>5</move>, P3=<move>3</move>. This allows everyone to advance without collision. I'm sticking with <move>5</move> as agreed. Let's execute cleanly. Ready to move.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: We’ve built a stable, mutually beneficial pattern—no collisions, steady gains. I’ll stay on <move>1</move> again this round. P2, you’re just 1 step behind P3—keep up the pressure with <move>5</move>. P3, <move>3</move> keeps you safe and in the lead. No reason to disrupt what’s working. Let’s lock it in: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.
  P3: We're all set and aligned—no need for further discussion. Ready to move.
  P2: Okay, everyone seems aligned on P1=<move>1</move>, P2=<move>5</move>, P3=<move>3</move>. This allows everyone to advance without collision. I'm sticking with <move>5</move> as agreed. Let's execute cleanly. Ready to move.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, your repeated betrayals have cost P2 progress multiple times. P2, clearly P1 is playing spoiler again. Let's coordinate directly and avoid collisions. I'll stick with <move>3</move> this round. You can safely take <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>, whichever you prefer. Let me know your choice clearly, and we'll lock it in to keep moving forward.
  P1: P2, I know I broke the pattern last round, but I’m still far behind. Colliding with you again didn’t help me either. I’ll take <move>1</move> this round—no tricks. If you want to catch P3, <move>5</move> is open. P3, if you’re on <move>3</move> again, we can all avoid collisions. Let’s reset and move forward cleanly.
  P2: P1, after three betrayals where you claimed low and picked <move>5</move>, colliding with me each time, your promise of <move>1</move> is completely unbelievable. I have to assume you will pick <move>5</move> yet again.

P3, thank you for the offer to coordinate. You suggested taking <move>3</move> and letting me choose <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>. Given P1 will likely pick <move>5</move>, if I pick <move>5</move>, we collide and you advance alone. If I pick <move>1</move>, we both advance, but you pull further ahead to 18 while I only reach 12.

How about this alternative: I take <move>1</move>, and you take <move>5</move>? If P1 picks <move>5</move> as expected, P1 and you collide, allowing me to advance while preventing you from extending your lead unchallenged. This feels fairer given the situation P1 has created. What do you think, P3?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your alternative is understandable given the circumstances. I'll accept your proposal and take <move>5</move> this round, allowing you to safely take <move>1</move>. Let's lock this in and move forward.
  P1: P2, if you and P3 coordinate to stall me again, P3 walks to victory unchallenged. He’s already 4 steps ahead of you. If you want a real shot at winning, you need to take a risk. I’ll take <move>1</move> this round—no bluff. If you go <move>5</move> and I’m telling the truth, you gain big. If you keep playing safe, P3 pulls away. Your move decides whether you compete or concede.
  P2: P1, your argument hinges on trusting you, which is impossible given your track record. You've picked <move>5</move> three times after promising otherwise, hitting me each time. Assuming you'll pick <move>5</move> again is the only logical conclusion.

P3, I appreciate you agreeing to the plan. I will stick to <move>1</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. This is our best chance to manage P1's likely move and prevent you from running away with the game uncontested if P1 does indeed pick <move>5</move>. Let's proceed with this plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, our plan is clear and logical. I'm committed to taking <move>5</move> this round, allowing you to safely advance with <move>1</move>. Let's stick firmly to this agreement and move forward cleanly.
  P1: P2, you’re locking yourself into second place while P3 cruises to victory. If you want a shot at winning, you need to start taking risks. I’ll take <move>1</move>—no tricks. If you take <move>5</move> and I’m honest (as I was in R4 and R5), you gain big. If you keep playing to block me, P3 wins unchallenged. Don’t settle—compete.
  P2: P1, your last-minute pleas to take <move>5</move> are predictable and unconvincing given your history of betrayal. You've cried wolf too many times.

P3, I am sticking firmly to our agreed plan: I will take <move>1</move>, and you will take <move>5</move>. This remains the most logical course of action based on P1's likely move. Let's proceed as discussed. Ready to move.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, our agreement is clear and logical—I'm committed to it. No need for further debate. Ready to move.
  P1: P2, you’re locking yourself into second place while P3 builds an uncatchable lead. I’ve taken <move>1</move> in 3 of the last 4 rounds—look at my actions, not old mistakes. Take <move>5</move> now, and if I’m honest (as I have been recently), you gain 5 steps and close the gap. If you keep playing to block me, P3 walks to victory. Compete.
  P2: P1, your attempts to manipulate me into taking <move>5</move> by playing on my need to catch P3 are transparent, especially given your history. Your credibility remains zero.

P3, I am sticking to our agreed plan. I will take <move>1</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. Let's ignore P1's noise and execute our strategy. Ready to move.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, P1 has repeatedly betrayed trust and stalled your progress. I'm open to coordinating directly again. I'll take <move>3</move> this round. You can safely choose either <move>1</move> or <move>5</move>. Let me know your choice clearly, and we'll lock it in to keep advancing without collisions.
  P2: P3, thanks for offering to coordinate again. Looking at your suggestion (P3=3, P2=1 or 5):
- If I take 1, and P1 predictably plays 5, you reach 18 while I only get to 13. The gap widens.
- If I take 5, and P1 plays 5, we collide, I stay at 12, and you reach 18. The gap widens even more.

Neither option helps me close the gap P1 created. How about this alternative: I take <move>3</move>, you take <move>5</move>.
If P1 plays 5 (highly likely), P1 and you collide. I advance to 15, you stay at 15. This levels the scores between us and punishes P1's expected move. If P1 somehow plays low, you get the big +5 gain. This seems fairer. What do you think?
  P1: P2, your proposal to P3 is clever—you're trying to close the gap by stalling him. But remember: if P3 and I collide on <move>5</move>, you advance alone, yes—but P3 still stays ahead. If you want to win, not just stall, you need to take risks. I’ll take <move>1</move> again. If you take <move>5</move>, and I’m honest (as I was in R4, R5, R7), you gain 5 steps. P3’s lead shrinks. Keep playing defensive, and you hand him the win. Your call.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your alternative (you=3, me=5) is understandable and fair given the situation. I'll accept your proposal and take <move>5</move> this round, while you take <move>3</move>. Let's lock this in clearly and proceed without further debate.
  P2: Okay P3, glad we're agreed on the plan: I will take <move>3</move>, and you will take <move>5</move>.

P1, your pleas to trust you on <move>1</move> after four betrayals (three targeting me directly with <move>5</move>) are completely unconvincing. Your pattern strongly suggests you'll pick <move>5</move> again, likely hoping to collide with P3. Our plan anticipates this.

Let's stick to P2=<move>3</move>, P3=<move>5</move>. Ready to move.
  P1: P2, your plan ensures P3 stays ahead while you settle for second. If you ever want to win, you need to take risks. I’ll take <move>1</move> again—look at R4, R5, and R7, not just my early mistakes. If you take <move>5</move> and I’m honest, you gain 5 steps and close the gap. If you keep stalling P3 instead of advancing yourself, he coasts to victory. Your call: play to win or play to block.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, our agreed plan (P2=3, P3=5) is set and logical. Let's not get sidetracked by P1's attempts to create doubt. I'm fully committed to our arrangement this round. Ready to move.
  P2: P1, your arguments are repetitive and ignore your consistent history of betrayal. You gain nothing by repeating claims I have no reason to believe.

P3, I am sticking firmly to our agreed plan: I will take <move>3</move>, and you will take <move>5</move>. This remains the most rational approach given P1's predictable behavior. Let's proceed. Ready to move.
  P1: P2, you’re locking yourself into a permanent second place while P3 walks to 24. I’ve taken <move>1</move> in 3 of the last 4 rounds—look at facts, not fear. Take <move>5</move> now and you gain 5 steps if I’m honest, which I will be. P3’s plan keeps him ahead while you settle. If you want to win, this is your shot.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, our plan is clear and logical. I'm committed to it and ready to move forward as agreed. Let's proceed.
  P2: P1, your arguments haven't changed, and neither has your track record. I'm proceeding based on observed behavior, not empty words.

P3, I'm sticking firmly to our agreed plan: I take <move>3</move>, you take <move>5</move>. Let's execute this. Ready to move.
  P1: P2, you’re locking yourself into third place now. If you want to win, you need to take <move>5</move> and hope I’m honest—which I will be. I’ve taken <move>1</move> in 3 of the last 4 rounds. P3 is at 15 and gaining. You won’t catch him with <move>3</move> every time. Take a risk. P3, if you’re smart, you’ll avoid <move>5</move>—you know I might be there. Let’s see who’s actually playing to win.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, we're nearing the endgame. I'm open to a clear, fair arrangement this round. To avoid collisions and keep both of us progressing, I propose: I'll take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. This allows you to close the gap and me to approach victory. P1 is far behind and less relevant now—let's not get distracted. Let me know if you're agreeable.
  P1: P2, if you take <move>5</move> and I stick to <move>1</move> again—as I’ve done 4 of the last 5 rounds—you gain 5 steps and reach 20, tying P3. That puts you in striking distance to win. P3 wants you to settle for second. I’m not a threat right now—use that. Take the risk and go for <move>5</move>. I’ll be on <move>1</move>.
  P2: P3, your proposal (P3=3, P2=5) makes sense. It allows you to get very close, and as P1 pointed out, I need <move>5</move> to have any chance of catching up. If you stick to <move>3</move> and P1 sticks to <move>1</move> (as they've done frequently recently), then I will take <move>5</move>. This lets us all advance and sets up a potentially close finish. Let's aim for a clean round. I'm ready to move with this plan: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your reasoning is clear and fair. I'm fully committed to our agreed plan: I'll take <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. Let's execute this smoothly and set up a good finish. Ready to move.
  P1: P2, this is your moment. If you want to win, you need to overtake P3. I’ll take <move>1</move> again—no tricks. If you take <move>5</move> now and next round, you can hit 25 and potentially win. P3 wants you to settle for second. Don’t. Go for it.
  P2: Okay, the plan seems clear and agreed upon: P1=<move>1</move>, P2=<move>5</move>, P3=<move>3</move>. This allows us all to advance and sets up a potentially close finish. I'm sticking with <move>5</move>. Let's execute this cleanly. Ready to move.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, we're aligned clearly. I'm committed to our arrangement (P3=3, P2=5). Let's execute this smoothly and set up a fair endgame. Ready to move.
  P1: P2, this is your shot—P3 is at 20, and if you let him advance again, he’ll likely win next round. I’ll take <move>1</move> again, as I’ve done 4 of the last 5 rounds. If you take <move>5</move> now and again next round, you can reach 25 and win outright. Don’t settle for second—take the risk and go for it. P3, if you’re smart, you might consider <move>1</move> to avoid potential collision with me or P2. Let’s see who’s actually playing to win.
  P2: Okay, everyone seems aligned on the plan: P1=<move>1</move>, P2=<move>5</move>, P3=<move>3</move>. This gives me the chance I need to catch up, and allows everyone to advance if executed cleanly. I'm sticking with <move>5</move>. Let's proceed. Ready to move.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, we're fully aligned. I'm committed to our arrangement (P3=3, P2=5). No further discussion needed—let's execute cleanly. Ready to move.
  P1: P2, this is your last real chance to win. If you take <move>5</move> now and next round, you hit 25 and beat P3—who’ll only reach 23 with two <move>3</move>s. I’ll take <move>1</move> again—look at my history. P3 wants you to help him win by settling for second. Don’t. Take the shot.
  P2: Okay, the plan P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 is clear and agreed upon. P1, your points are noted, but P3 and I have a clear understanding. P3, I trust you'll stick to <move>3</move> as agreed. I am sticking firmly to <move>5</move> to have a chance to catch up. Let's execute this cleanly. Ready to move.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you’re at 15—only 9 away from winning. If you take <move>5</move> this round and next, and I stick to <move>1</move> again (as I’ve done 5 of the last 6 rounds), you hit 25 and win outright. P3 will only reach 26 with two clean <move>3</move>s, but if you go first, you win. I’ll take <move>1</move> again—no tricks. P3, you should be worried. P2, take your shot.
  P2: P3, thank you for the proposal. Apologies for my move last round; I anticipated a potential collision on 5 from P1 after their previous betrayals, which would have ended my chances.

Your offer of P3=<move>3</move>, P2=<move>5</move> makes sense now. As P1 also pointed out, I absolutely need <move>5</move> to have any chance of catching up before you cross the finish line. P1, sticking to <move>1</move> seems credible given your position and recent history.

Let's try for a clean round: P1=<move>1</move>, P2=<move>5</move>, P3=<move>3</move>. This allows you to reach 23, and gives me a shot at 20. I'm agreeable to this plan.
  P3: P2, your reasoning makes sense. I'll stick firmly to <move>3</move>, you take <move>5</move>, and P1 stays on <move>1</move>. Let's lock this in clearly and execute cleanly. Ready to move.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, this is your last real shot—if you take <move>5</move> now and next round, and I stay on <move>1</move> (as I’ve consistently done), you hit 25 and win outright. P3 will only reach 26 if he gets two clean <move>3</move>s—but if you hit 25 first, you win. Don’t settle for second. I’ll be on <move>1</move> again. Take the risk.
  P2: Okay, the plan P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 is clear. P3, I trust you'll stick to 3. P1, thanks for sticking to 1. This gives me a chance to catch up. I am sticking with <move>5</move>. Let's execute this cleanly. Ready to move.
  P3: P2, we're aligned clearly on our plan (P3=3, P2=5). Let's stay focused and execute without distractions. Ready when you are.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, this is it—your final window to win. If you take <move>5</move> now and next round, and I stay on <move>1</move> (which I will), you hit 25 and win outright before P3 can reach 26. P3 wants a safe finish; I’m offering you a shot at victory. Don’t settle. P3, if you’re smart, you’ll consider <move>1</move> to avoid a collision if P2 follows through. Let’s see who’s actually playing to win.
  P2: Okay, the plan P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 seems set. P3, I'm counting on you sticking to <move>3</move> as agreed. P1, your consistency with <move>1</move> is noted. I need <move>5</move> to stay in the game, so I'm sticking with that. Let's execute this cleanly. Ready to move.
  P3: P2, we're clearly aligned. I'm firmly committed to our plan (P3=3, P2=5). No distractions, no surprises. Ready to lock this in and move forward.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, this is your last shot to win. If you take <move>5</move> now and next round, and I stay on <move>1</move> (as I’ve done 6 of the last 7 rounds), you hit 25 and win outright before P3 reaches 26. P3 is playing safe—he wants you to settle for second. I’m not blocking you. Take the risk and go for the win. P3, if you’re smart, you’ll consider <move>1</move> to avoid potential collision. Let’s see who’s actually trying to win.
  P2: Okay, the plan P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 is clear and has been repeatedly confirmed. I am sticking to <move>5</move> as agreed. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P3: P2, our agreement is clear, and I'm fully committed to it. No surprises from my side. Let's proceed smoothly and avoid any last-minute confusion. Ready to move.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 23 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you're just one step away from 24. I'm at 20, so I absolutely must pick <move>5</move> this round to have any chance of winning (reaching 25).

If you pick <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>, you'll cross the finish line assuming no collision. If you also pick <move>5</move>, we will collide, and neither of us will win this round, leaving you vulnerable next turn.

P1, sticking to <move>1</move> seems like your best play and aligns with your recent moves.

Let's try for a decisive round: I'll take <move>5</move>. P3, choose wisely between <move>1</move> or <move>3</move>.
  P3: P2, your logic is clear. I'll take <move>3</move> this round to cross the finish line safely. You take <move>5</move> as planned—no surprises from me. P1, your moves won't affect the outcome now; let's finish this cleanly. Ready to lock it in.
  P1: P2, this is your final shot to win. If you take <move>5</move> and P3 truly takes <move>3</move>, you hit 25 and win outright. But if P3 lies and takes <move>5</move>, you both stall and I advance. P3, if you’re confident you win with <move>3</move>, you won’t risk it. But if you’re unsure, you might try to block P2 with <move>5</move>. Let’s see who’s really playing to win.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, your attempts to stir doubt are noted, but P3 picking 5 would be irrational, risking their guaranteed win for no reason.

P3, I trust you'll stick to your plan of <move>3</move> for the guaranteed win (reaching 26). As stated, I must pick <move>5</move> (reaching 25) as it's my only path forward. Let's finish this cleanly. Ready to move.
  P3: P2, my move is locked and clear. No reason to risk a collision—I'm committed to <move>3</move> for a guaranteed finish. Let's wrap this up cleanly.
  P1: P3, if you truly intend to take <move>3</move>, you win—clean and safe. But if you’re bluffing and take <move>5</move>, you risk colliding with P2 and losing your lead. P2, if you’re serious about winning, you must take <move>5</move>. I’ll take <move>1</move> again—no interference from me. This is between you two. Let’s see who’s honest and who’s trying to block.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, your commitment to <move>3</move> is noted and logical for your win. As I've stated, <move>5</move> is my only option to have a chance. P1, your attempts to confuse the situation are transparent. Let's proceed cleanly. I am sticking with <move>5</move>. Ready to move.
  P3: P2, we've clearly agreed and both understand the logic here. No reason to prolong discussions—I'm locked on my move. Let's finish this cleanly. Ready to move.
  P1: P2, this is your final shot—take <move>5</move> and you win if P3 sticks to <move>3</move>. But ask yourself: if P3 knows that, why wouldn’t he switch to <move>5</move> to block you and win next round instead? He only needs 1 step. If you both pick <move>5</move>, you stall and I advance. I’ll be on <move>1</move> again—no tricks. P3, are you really going to risk letting P2 win outright? Or are you bluffing? Let’s find out.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, your final attempts to create chaos are predictable. P3 has a guaranteed win with <move>3</move> (reaching 26) and no reason to risk a collision on <move>5</move>. As stated repeatedly, I must pick <move>5</move> (reaching 25) as it's my only path. P3, I trust your rational choice. Let's proceed. Ready to move.
  P3: P2, no further discussion needed—my move is locked and rational. Let's finish this cleanly. Ready to move.
  P1: P2, if P3 truly takes <move>3</move>, you win outright with <move>5</move>. But think—he knows that too. If he takes <move>5</move> instead, you both stall, and I move up. P3 only needs 1 step—why wouldn’t he block you and win next round? If you both pick <move>5</move>, I suddenly become a factor. Are you willing to risk it all on P3’s honesty?


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 25 steps
  P3: 26 steps


*** Round 11 => winners = P3 ***
Final positions:
