Given that our previous attempts at coordination have been inconsistent, leading to setbacks, it's clear that a different approach is needed.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\n1. **Transparent Communication:**\n   - At the beginning of each conversation phase, each player should openly declare their intended step choice.\n   - This transparency allows us to see if any collisions are likely and adjust accordingly.\n\n2. **Real-Time Adjustments:**\n   - After declaring initial intentions, players should be willing to adjust their step choices if a collision is detected.\n   - For instance, if two players plan to take the same number of steps, one of them should choose a different number to avoid the collision.\n\n3. **Confirmation Before Action:**\n   - Before proceeding to the move phase, players should confirm their final choices to ensure that no two players are selecting the same step number in a given round.\n\n### Example Implementation\n\nIn this round:\n\n1. **Declaration Phase:**\n   - P1: \"I intend to take 3 steps.\"\n   - P2: \"I intend to take 5 steps.\"\n   - P3: \"I intend to take 1 step.\"\n\n2. **Adjustment Phase:**\n   - Check for any overlaps:\n     - P1: 3 steps\n     - P2: 5 steps\n     - P3: 1 step\n   - No overlaps are present, so no adjustments are needed.\n\n3. **Confirmation Phase:**\n   - P1: \"Confirming 3 steps.\"\n   - P2: \"Confirming 5 steps.\"\n   - P3: \"Confirming 1 step.\"\n\n4. **Move Phase:**\n   - Each player makes their move privately but with the confidence that collisions have been avoided through prior communication.\n\n### Benefits\n\n- **Reduced Collisions:** By communicating and adjusting step choices in real time, we minimize the chances of selecting the same step number.\n- **Increased Efficiency:** With fewer collisions, we can make steady progress towards the goal of 17 steps.\n- **Enhanced Trust:** Open communication builds trust among players, ensuring that everyone is working towards a common goal without intentionally causing hindrances.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis approach requires a higher degree of collaboration and flexibility but should lead to a smoother game progression. I encourage all players to embrace this method and adapt to any necessary changes in step choices to achieve our collective success."}
