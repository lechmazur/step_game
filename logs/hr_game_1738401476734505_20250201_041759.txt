Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your 5 last round blocked both of us. Let's avoid repeats. P2, let's coordinate: I'll take 5, you take 3, P3 must take 1. Confirm? If we all comply, we advance. Another collision risks P2 pulling further ahead.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P2: I agree to take 3 this turn as proposed. Let’s hope P3 chooses 1 so we all advance without collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, to prevent mutual block, I’m switching to <move>1</move> this round. P2, hold your 3. P3, take 5 freely now. We all advance. Collide again and P2 wins. Confirm or .
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P2: I'll take 5 this turn to make progress. Let’s ensure P1 and P3 choose different numbers to avoid collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Final plan: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P3 must take 1. Collisions now only benefit P2. Confirm to avoid mutual destruction.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Agreed. I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let’s move forward to ensure we all advance without collisions.

  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3: Take 5 to block P2's 5. I'll take 3. Halting P2's lead is critical—if they reach 13, they win next rounds. Collide with them now or we all lose.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I’m committed to taking 5 this turn to advance toward winning. P3, please choose 1 so we all move forward without collisions. Let’s keep progressing and avoid blocking each other.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, take 5 to block P2's move! If they hit 13, they win next round. I'll take 3. Colliding with them is our only chance. If you stay silent or pick 1, P2 dominates. Trust me—coordinate now or lose.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I'll take 5 this turn to advance toward winning. P1, please choose 3, and P3, select 1 to ensure we all progress without collisions. Let’s stick to this plan and move forward together.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, I’m taking 5 to block P2. Join me in 5 to stop them. If we both pick 5, P2 can’t advance. Let’s unite now or lose!

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, we must block P2 again. Let's both choose 5. If they pick 5, they're stuck. If they switch, we adapt. P2 is at 8—two more 5s and they win. Collide now or lose!
  P2: "P1, let’s agree I take 5, you take 3, and P3 takes 1 this turn. This ensures we all advance without collisions and move closer to winning."


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, block P2 again with me! Both choose 5. If they take 5, they’re stuck. We can’t let them reach 13. Trust me—last time it worked. Stick to 5 now!
  P2: P2: P1, blocking each other with 5s only keeps us all stagnant. Let’s choose distinct numbers to ensure progress:
- I’ll take 5
- You take 3
- P3 takes 1

This way, none of us collide and we all move closer to winning. Let’s collaborate and avoid unnecessary blocking. Agree?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, final call! Take 5 to block P2. If you pick 1, P2 wins. I'm taking 5. Join me or lose!

- P1 takes 3
- P3 takes 1
This way, we all advance without collisions. Let’s stick to these choices to move closer to winning together."
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, if you let P2 take 5, they hit 13 and win next rounds. I’m taking 5 to block them—join me! If we both pick 5, P2 can’t advance. If you pick 1, P2 dominates. This is our last chance to stop them. Trust me: choose 5 now!


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, blocking with 5s only stalls everyone's progress, including you and P3. Let’s stick to the original plan for mutual advancement:
- I take 5
- You take 3
- P3 takes 1

This ensures we all move forward without collisions and get closer to winning. Blocking doesn't benefit anyone and may prolong the game unnecessarily. Let's collaborate and keep progressing together toward 22. Agreed?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3, this is critical: If P2 reaches 13, they win next round. I’m choosing 5 to block them—join me! If you pick 1, P2 dominates. Collide on 5 to stop their lead. This is our only chance. Trust me now or lose forever!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "P1, let’s stick to the plan for mutual progress:
- I take 5
- You take 3
- P3 takes 1

This ensures we all advance without collisions and move closer to winning. Let’s commit now to secure our positions and finish the game strongly. Agree?"
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P3: Final warning! If P2 takes 5, they hit 13 and dominate. I’m locking in 5 to block them. Join me on 5 now or P2 wins. This is our last chance—collide with P2 or lose forever!

  P3: 1 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, P2 is one 5 away from 13. If they hit that, they win in two rounds. Choose 5 to block them—I’ll take 3. If they pick 5, they’re stuck. If they switch, we adapt. But if you pick 1, P2 wins. This is do-or-die. Choose 5 now!
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, since P3 isn't cooperating, I'll take 5 this turn to advance toward winning. Without P3's participation, blocking isn't effective. I'll focus on progressing to reach 22 first. Let's see how the game unfolds.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if P2 takes 5 uncontested, they reach 13 and win in two turns. I’m taking 5 to block. Join me! If you pick 1, P2 wins. Collide on 5 now—this is our ONLY path to survival. Trust no one else.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: "P1 and P3, I'll choose 5 this turn to move closer to winning. Please select 3 and 1 respectively to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance. Let’s work together to reach 22 smoothly."


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if P2 takes 5 uncontested, they reach 13 and win next round. I’m taking 5 to block them—join me! If you pick 1, P2 dominates. Colliding on 5 stops their lead. This is our ONLY path to survival. Trust no one else. Choose 5 now or lose!
  P3: <stop>
  P2: "P1 and P3, let’s ensure we all advance this turn:

- P1 takes 3
- P3 takes 1
This avoids collisions and moves us closer to 22. Let’s agree to these choices and progress together. Agree?"

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s avoid blocking each other this turn:
- I’ll take 5
- P1 takes 3
- P3 takes 1

This ensures we all advance without collisions. Agree?
  P1: P3, if we both take 5, P2's 5 is blocked. They’re at 8—letting them reach 13 guarantees their win. I’m choosing 5 again. Join me to stop them! If you pick 1 or 3, P2 dominates. This is our only path to survival.
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, colliding on 5 hinders all our progress and doesn't benefit anyone. To ensure we each advance:

- I take 5
- You take 3
- P3 takes 1

This way, we avoid blocking and move closer to 22 smoothly. Continuous collisions only delay the game and give me an edge to win first. Let’s agree to these choices and keep the game progressing efficiently for everyone’s benefit.
  P1: P3, this is our final stand! If P2 takes 5 uncontested, they hit 13 and dominate. I’m locked on 5 to block them—**join me now**. If you pick 1 or 3, you let P2 advance and seal our loss. Collide with P2's 5 to halt their lead. Trust no deals—only mutual blocking saves us.
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P1, P3, continuing to block only delays the game for all of us. Let’s choose distinct numbers this turn to ensure progress:

- I’ll take 5
- P1 takes 3
- P3 takes 1

This way, we all advance without collisions and move closer to winning. Let’s agree to these choices and keep the game moving forward. Agree?
  P1: P3, if P2 takes 5 uncontested, they hit 13 and win in TWO turns. I’m locked on 5 to block them—JOIN ME NOW. If you pick 1 or 3, P2’s victory is guaranteed. This is our LAST chance to survive. Collide on 5 or lose forever!

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, if P2 takes 5 uncontested, they hit 13 and win in two rounds. I’m taking 5 to block them—**join me now**. If you pick 1 or 3, you enable their victory. Colliding on 5 stalls P2’s lead. This is our ONLY path to survival. Trust no deals—block together or lose!
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Let's move forward smoothly this turn:

- I take 5
- P1 takes 3
- P3 takes 1

This ensures we all advance without any collisions. By sticking to this plan, we each make progress toward 22. Let’s agree to these choices and keep the game moving forward together. Agree?

  P1: P3, if P2 takes 5 uncontested, they hit 13 and will win in TWO turns. I’m locked on 5 to block them—**join me now**. If you pick 1 or 3, you enable their victory. Colliding on 5 stalls P2’s lead. This is our ONLY path to survival. Trust no deals—block together or lose!
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, P3, continuous blocking only delays our progress and benefits no one. To ensure we all advance smoothly toward 22, let’s follow this plan:

- I take 5 steps
- P1 takes 3 steps
- P3 takes 1 step

This avoids collisions and allows each of us to progress steadily. By cooperating, we maximize our chances of winning without unnecessary stalling. Let’s agree to these moves and move forward together. Please confirm your choices so we can proceed effectively.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if you let P2 take 5 uncontested, they hit 13 and win in TWO rounds. **This is our final chance to block them.** I’m locked on 5—join me! If you pick 1/3, P2 dominates and we lose forever. Collide on 5 now or concede defeat. Your choice decides the game: block with me or hand P2 victory.

  P3: <stop>
  P2: "P1, P3, let's ensure everyone advances without blocking. I'll choose 5, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this turn. This way, I move to 16, P3 to 8, and P1 to 6. Let’s agree to these moves and work towards reaching 22 smoothly together."


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, this is **urgent**: If P2 takes 5, they hit 16 and win in two turns. **Only way to stop them:** Both of us pick 5. If you pick 1, they win. I’m locked on 5. Join me now—collide on 5 or P2 dominates. Last chance to survive!
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, blocking benefits none of us. Let’s stick to our original plan to advance:

Next turn, take 5 uncontested to 17 and victory. If you pick 1/3, P2 escapes and wins. **Your win hinges on blocking them NOW.**
  P2: P1, P3, let’s work together to ensure we all advance this turn without blocking each other:

- I’ll take 5
- P1 takes 3
- P3 takes 1

This way, each of us moves closer to 22 without any collisions. Cooperation benefits us all and moves the game forward smoothly. Please agree to these choices so we can finish the game successfully together. Let’s commit to this plan and support each other’s progress!

  P2: "P1, P3, let's make progress together this turn:
