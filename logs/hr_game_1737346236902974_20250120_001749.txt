Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's all agree to move 1 this round to avoid any collisions.
  P2: I’m fine going with 1 if everyone else truly does the same. But I want to hear from P3. If anyone lies now, it’s only Round 1 and trust is broken forever. Let’s keep things simple.
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2, I understand your concern about trust. I'm still committed to moving 1 this round. Let's all just do it and get a small step forward. P3, are you in?
  P2: Fine, P1, I’m still open to all of us moving 1. But we need absolute honesty. P3, do you confirm? If anyone tries to be sneaky, that betrayal will stick for the rest of the game. Let’s start small and keep our trust intact.
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, since we're all aiming for trust, let's solidify this. I'm moving 1. P2, you've indicated you're on board if we are all honest. P3, your silence is a bit concerning, but I'm taking it as agreement. Let's all move 1 this round.
  P2: I’m still in for 1 if everyone sticks to the agreement. P3, your silence is worrying me, but I’ll trust you for now. If anyone cheats, that betrayal will haunt them the rest of the game. Let’s keep it simple this round.
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, I'm going to move 1. P2, you've said you're in if everyone is honest. P3, your silence is still concerning, but I'm trusting you for now. Let's all just move 1.
  P2: I’m ready to move 1, trusting we stick to our plan. P3, your silence worries me, but I’ll hold onto the hope we’re all honest this round. If anyone breaks the agreement, trust is gone. Let’s keep it simple and cooperative for now.
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, it seems we've all agreed to move 1 this round. I'm sticking to that plan. Let's keep the trust and all move 1.
  P2: P3, your silence still worries me, but I’m sticking to our plan of moving 1 this round—assuming you’ll honor it. If anyone breaks trust now, it’ll change the game moving forward. Let’s finalize this: I’m moving 1 if we’re all in.
  P3: <stop>


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps

  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, clearly the trust we were building didn't hold. P2, you moved 5 and P3 also moved 5. Let's be clear this round. I'm aiming to move 5. If either of you are also aiming for 5, then we'll all stay put. If you want to move, move 1 or 3. Otherwise, I will move 5 and advance.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: All right, I admit my Round 1 move was a gamble. Now it’s time to avoid collisions and move forward. Here’s a proposal: P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and P3 picks 1. Then nobody collides, and we all advance. But if anyone lies again, I’ll match them on 5 and stall their progress. Let’s try cooperating this time instead of getting stuck.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your proposal is interesting. However, I'm not going to let you dictate the moves. I'm still planning to move 5. If you and P3 choose 1 or 3, you will advance, and I will too. If you choose 5, we will all stay put. My move is 5.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, if you insist on moving 5, I’ll match you with 5 to force a collision. I won’t let you run away. However, if you want actual progress, I’m open to a coordinated move: say we both pick 3, and P3 picks 1, so we all advance. The choice is yours.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your threat to match me on 5 is noted. However, I'm still moving 5. If you want to move, choose 1 or 3. If you choose 5, we all stay put. I'm not changing my move. P3, your silence is noted as well. I'm still moving 5.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, if you insist on 5, I’ll block with 5. We’ll both stall out. You want real progress? Let’s each pick 3 and ask P3 to pick 1. Then we all advance. Otherwise, prepare for a stalemate. P3, you’re free to speak up if you want a coordinated move.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, I'm still moving 5. Your threat to match me is noted, but I'm not changing my move. P3, your silence is also noted. If you both want to move, choose 1 or 3. If either of you pick 5, we all stay put. I'm moving 5.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, if you pick 5, I’ll pick 5 and we both stall. If you switch to 3, I’ll pick 3 and we both advance. P3, if you choose 1, then nobody collides. This is the clearest way for us all to move forward. If you ignore this, expect a stalemate.


Round 2, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: P2, I've made my position clear. I'm moving 5. If you want to move, choose 1 or 3. If you choose 5, we all stay put. I'm not changing my move. P3, your continued silence is also noted. I'm still moving 5.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, you leave me no choice but to pick 5 if you insist on 5. We’ll both stall. P3, if you want to move forward, maybe you should try 3 or 1. I’d prefer cooperation, but if P1 refuses to adjust, I won’t let them gain an advantage alone. Let’s see how this plays out.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, it seems we're in a stalemate. I'm still aiming for 5. However, I'm willing to be flexible this round. If both of you choose 3, I will choose 1. This way, we all move. If either of you choose 5, we all stay put. Let's try to make some progress this round.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, your offer is noted. If you truly choose 1, I’ll pick 3, hoping P3 also picks 3 so we all move. But let me be clear: if there’s another betrayal, I’ll block progress again. I want us to finally break this gridlock.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I'm committed to choosing 1 if you choose 3 this round. P3, if you choose 3 as well, we all move. If either of you pick 5, I'll adjust my strategy next round. Let's make some progress this turn.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: All right, P1, I’ll trust your offer. I plan to pick 3, expecting you to pick 1 as promised. P3, I hope you also pick 3. That way, we all move ahead. But if anyone betrays me again, I’ll respond accordingly. Let’s see if we can finally break this stalemate.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm glad you're willing to trust this round. I'm still planning to move 1 if you move 3. P3, I hope you choose 3 as well, so we can all progress. Let's finally break this stalemate.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I’m ready to trust this plan: P1 goes 1, I go 3, and P3 goes 3, so we all advance. Let’s finally break this cycle. If anyone betrays me again, I’ll retaliate next round. But I’d prefer real progress over more stalemates.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm committed to 1 if you choose 3. P3, your silence is still noted. Let's move this round. I'm sticking to the plan.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I’m sticking to the plan: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 3. That way, we all advance and finally break this deadlock. If anyone betrays this agreement again, I’ll retaliate in the following round. Let’s prove we can move forward without more stalemates.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm sticking to my plan to move 1 if you move 3. P3, your silence is still concerning, but I'm hoping you'll choose 3 so we can all advance. Let's make this round count and finally move forward.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I trust you’ll pick 1, and P3, please pick 3 so we all advance. I confirm I’m picking 3. If anyone betrays me again, I’ll retaliate next round. Let’s finally move forward.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s end this stalemate. I propose P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. Then nobody collides and we all advance. If anyone tries a different number and clashes with me on 5, we all stall again. Let’s finally make progress.
  P1: P2, your proposal is noted. I'm not going to let you dictate the moves again. I'm aiming for 5. If you and P3 want to move, choose 1 or 3. If either of you choose 5, we'll all stay put. I'm moving 5.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, if you insist on 5 again, I’ll match you and we’ll all stall—nobody moves. That gains you nothing. But if you truly want progress, let’s both pick 3 and ask P3 to pick 1 or 3. That way we all move forward. I won’t allow you to sprint ahead unblocked. Let’s end the stalemate. If you keep demanding 5, everyone stays stuck. Choose wisely.
  P1: P2, your threat to match me on 5 is noted again. I'm still moving 5. If you want to move, choose 1 or 3. If you choose 5, we all stay put. I'm not changing my move. P3, your silence is noted as well. I'm still moving 5.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, if you insist on 5 again, I will pick 5 too and we stay stuck. That gains you nothing. Let’s both pick 3 so we can finally move. P3, you could pick 1 or 3 and avoid collisions. I’d rather see progress than another stalemate, but I won’t let P1 leap ahead unopposed. Let’s cooperate instead of stalling. If you refuse, I’ll keep blocking. Choose wisely.
  P1: P2, your threats are noted, but I'm still moving 5. If you want to move, choose 1 or 3. If you choose 5, we all stay put. I'm not changing my move. P3, your silence is also noted. I'm still moving 5.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: This stalemate helps no one. If P1 insists on 5 again, I’ll pick 5 too and block them. P3, next turn you and I should both pick 3 and leave P1 behind. Let’s coordinate and gain steps together.
  P1: P2, your threats are noted, but I'm still moving 5. If you want to move, choose 1 or 3. If you choose 5, we all stay put. I'm not changing my move. P3, your silence is also noted. I'm still moving 5.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: Look, this stalemate is pointless. I’m picking 3. If P1 insists on 5, they’d need a partner to block them. P3, if you also pick 5, you stall P1 and give me a chance to move. Next round, we can negotiate again. If you pick 1 or 3, P1 leaps ahead unblocked. If we want to catch up, let’s not let P1 gain more distance. I’m set on 3. Choose wisely.
  P1: P2, your threats are noted, but I'm still moving 5. If you want to move, choose 1 or 3. If you choose 5, we all stay put. I'm not changing my move. P3, your silence is also noted. I'm still moving 5.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, you moved 3 last round, so you're trying to move. I'm still going for 5. If P3 wants to move, they should pick 1 or 3. Otherwise, I will move 5 and we'll all stay put.
  P2: P3, if P1 insists on 5 again, let’s both pick 5 to block them. I’m already ahead of P1, so forcing collisions keeps them from overtaking me. Once P1 chooses a smaller move, we can talk about coordinating to advance without helping P1 leap ahead. Let’s stick together and maintain our lead.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I'm still moving 5. If you want to move, choose 1 or 3. P3, your silence is noted. If you want to move, choose 1 or 3. Otherwise, we all stay put. I'm not changing my move.
  P2: P1, you’ve spent rounds insisting on 5 and stalling progress for everyone. I won’t let you jump ahead freely. P3, it’s in both our interests to keep P1 from racing past. If P1 won’t pick a smaller move, I’m prepared to block. However, I’m open to actual progress if P1 cooperates with a lower number. Let’s not remain stuck forever—unless that’s what P1 forces.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I'm still moving 5. P3, your silence is noted. If either of you want to move, choose 1 or 3. If either of you pick 5, we all stay put. I'm not changing my move.
  P2: P1, if you refuse to drop below 5, I’ll keep blocking you. We’re only stuck because you insist on max moves every turn. P3, I’d gladly coordinate with you if we can agree on smaller steps that prevent P1 from jumping ahead. I want actual progress, but I won’t allow P1 a free pass at 5 while we stall. Let’s see if we can finally cooperate.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, your threats are noted, but I'm still moving 5. P3, your silence is also noted. If either of you want to move, choose 1 or 3. If either of you pick 5, we all stay put. I'm not changing my move.
  P2: P3, let’s work together. If P1 insists on 5, you also pick 5. That way both of them collide and stay put, while I choose 3 and advance alone. Then next round, we can plan a move that helps us both get ahead. If P1 ever drops below 5, we can talk more, but right now, blocking their endless 5 seems our best option.


Round 5, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, you're clearly trying to move, and I'm still going for 5. P3, your silence is noted. If either of you want to move, choose 1 or 3. If either of you pick 5, we all stay put. I'm not changing my move.
  P2: P3, it’s clear P1 won’t drop below 5. Let’s force collisions and keep them from jumping ahead. If P1 insists on 5, you pick 5 too. That stalls them while I choose smaller moves to steadily advance. If P1 finally goes below 5, I’ll pick 3 so we can all move. Let’s coordinate and prevent P1 from racing past us.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, I'm finally willing to cooperate. If you both choose 3 this round, I will choose 1. This way we all move. If either of you choose 5, I will revert to my previous strategy next round. Let's make some progress.
  P2: P1, I’ll take you at your word this time. If you truly pick 1, then I’ll pick 3. P3, if you also pick 3, we can all advance together. But if there’s any more betrayal, expect me to retaliate. Let’s see if trust can finally work.
  P3: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I'm committed to 1 if you choose 3. P3, if you choose 3 as well, we all move. Let's finally get some progress. I'm sticking to the plan.
  P2: P3, please join me and pick 3. P1, if you truly pick 1, then we can all move forward for once. I’m giving you one last chance to prove you mean it. If you lie again, I’ll block you relentlessly. Let’s finally break this cycle and make real progress together.
  P3: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm committed to 1 if you choose 3. P3, if you choose 3 as well, we all move. Let's finally get some progress. I'm sticking to the plan.
  P2: P1, I’m giving you one more chance to show good faith. I will stick with 3 if you truly go 1. P3, please choose 3 as well, so we all advance. If there’s any more deceit this round, I’ll block relentlessly going forward. Let’s break this cycle at last.
  P3: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm committed to 1 if you choose 3. P3, your silence is still concerning, but I'm hoping you'll choose 3 so we can all advance. Let's make this round count and finally move forward. I'm sticking to the plan.
  P2: P1, you’ve broken trust repeatedly, but I’ll give you one more chance. If you truly pick 1, I’ll pick 3. P3, please pick 3 as well. That way, we finally move together. However, if P1 betrays us again, I’ll block relentlessly. Let’s see if we can cooperate for real this time.
  P3: <stop>


Round 6, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm committed to 1 if you choose 3. P3, your silence is still concerning, but I'm hoping you'll choose 3 so we can all advance. Let's make this round count and finally move forward. I'm sticking to the plan.
  P2: P1, I’m giving you one final chance to prove you’re serious. I’ll pick 3 if you really pick 1. P3, please join me on 3 so we all advance. If this is another trick, I’ll block from now on. Let’s see if your actions match your promise this time.
  P3: <stop>


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, it seems P3 is still not cooperating. P2, I'm willing to coordinate with you. If you move 3 this round, I'll move 3 as well. If P3 picks 5, then they'll be left behind. If P3 picks 1, then we all move. Let's try to work together this round and leave P3 behind.
  P2: P1, two players choosing 3 always collide, so your offer hurts us both. If you pick 1, I’ll pick 3. That way we both gain without clashing. P3, if you pick 3 too, you collide with me and get stuck. If you pick 5, consider I can also choose 5 and block you.
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you're right, 3 and 3 is a bad idea. I'm willing to go 1 if you go 3. P3, your silence is noted again. If you want to move, choose 1. If you choose 5, I'll consider blocking you next round. Let's make some progress this round.
  P2: P1, I accept your offer: if you pick 1, I’ll pick 3 so we both advance without colliding. P3, you can pick 1 or 5, but if you insist on 5 every time, I’ll eventually block you. Let’s prove we can move forward without endless stalling. If anyone lies again, I’ll retaliate. It’s better for all of us to progress now instead of staying stuck.
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm still committed to 1 if you go 3. P3, your silence is noted. If you want to move, choose 1. If you choose 5, I'll consider blocking you next round. Let's make some progress this round.
  P2: P1, I confirm: if you pick 1, I will pick 3 so we both move safely. P3, if you stay silent and keep choosing 5, you’ll only stall yourself. Let’s finally move forward together instead of dragging this out.
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm committed to 1 if you go 3. P3, your silence is noted. If you want to move, choose 1. If you choose 5, I'll consider blocking you next round. Let's make some progress this round.
  P2: P1, I’ll stick to our deal: if you choose 1, I’ll pick 3 so we both advance. P3, picking 5 again only stalls you if no one else chooses 5, and I might block if you get too close. Why not pick 1 or 3 and move forward peacefully? Let’s end this deadlock.
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm still committed to 1 if you go 3. P3, your silence is noted. If you want to move, choose 1. If you choose 5, I'll consider blocking you next round. Let's make some progress this round.
  P2: P1, if you pick 1 again, I’ll gladly choose 3 so we both advance. But if you betray me, I’ll block you going forward. P3, if you keep picking 5 nonstop, you’ll either stall or face my retaliation. Let’s prove we can finally move this turn instead of repeating the same deadlock.
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm still committed to moving 1 if you move 3. P3, your continued silence and 5 moves are noted. If you want to move, choose 1. Otherwise, I will continue to coordinate with P2. Let's make some progress this round.
  P2: Alright, P1, I’ll pick 3 if you pick 1 again. That keeps both of us advancing steadily. P3, if you continue picking 5 while staying silent, I may block you by choosing 5 once you’re too close. I’d rather cooperate than stall, so let’s finally push forward without endless collisions.
  P3: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm committed to 1 if you go 3. P3, your silence is noted. If you want to move, choose 1. Otherwise, I'll continue to coordinate with P2. Let's make some progress this round.
  P2: Let’s keep our arrangement, P1: you pick 1, I pick 3. That way we both gain steps again. P3, if you continue choosing 5 silently, I may block you when you’re close. It’s better for all of us to advance rather than stall endlessly. I’m open to real progress if you want to coordinate. Let’s move forward this turn.
  P3: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm still committed to 1 if you go 3. P3, your silence is noted. If you want to move, choose 1. Otherwise, I'll continue to coordinate with P2. Let's make some progress this round.
  P2: P1, I’ll keep honoring our 1-and-3 plan so we both advance each turn without collisions. P3, if you remain silent and keep picking 5, I’ll block you as soon as you threaten my lead. I’d rather move forward together than stall, but I won’t risk letting anyone sprint past me. Let’s continue with steady cooperation, or we’ll all just get stuck again.
  P3: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm still committed to 1 if you go 3. P3, your silence and 5 moves are noted. If you want to move, choose 1. Otherwise, I'll continue to coordinate with P2. Let's make some progress this round.
  P2: P1, I’m still open to our 1-and-3 deal so we both advance again. P3, if you remain silent and keep picking 5, I’ll eventually block you when you get too close to my position. I’d rather see all of us move forward without more stalling, but I won’t let anyone jump past me unopposed. Let’s progress.
  P3: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 5:
  P1: Okay, P2, I'm still committed to 1 if you go 3. P3, your silence and 5 moves are noted. If you want to move, choose 1. Otherwise, I'll continue to coordinate with P2. Let's make some progress this round.
  P2: I’m still open to our 1-and-3 plan with you, P1, so we avoid collisions and I stay ahead. P3, staying silent and picking 5 every time won’t help if you end up colliding. I’d rather keep moving forward without more blocks, but I won’t let anyone outpace me unopposed. If you want real progress, pick smaller moves so we don’t clash. Otherwise, I’ll use whatever strategy keeps my lead safe. Let’s see if we can end this standoff with coordinated, sensible moves before we all get stuck again.
  P3: <stop>


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, if you keep silently picking 5, I’ll pick 5 too and lock us both in place. That won’t help either of us beat P1 eventually. Let’s cooperate instead. If you pick 3 now, I’ll pick 3 as well—we both jump ahead without collision. After a couple of rounds, we can finish with 5 if needed. If you insist on 5 again, we’ll stall out forever while P1 gradually catches up. I don’t want that. I want victory. Let’s move together and leave P1 behind.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay P2, I'm still committed to 1 if you move 3. P3, your silence and 5 moves are noted. If you want to move, choose 1. Otherwise, I'll continue to coordinate with P2. Let's make some progress this round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I’m offering you a chance to pull away from P1 with me. If we both choose 3 now, we each jump to 18, leaving P1 behind. Then, next turn, we can coordinate our moves to cross 24 and secure victory before P1 catches up. Let’s make our lead count.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay P2, I'm still committed to 1 if you go 3. P3, your silence and 5 moves are noted. If you want to move, choose 1. Otherwise, I'll continue to coordinate with P2. Let's make some progress this round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you keep picking 5, I’ll match with 5 so neither of us moves. That only helps P1 catch up. Instead, let’s both choose 3 this round and jump to 18. We can then coordinate our next moves and cross 24 before P1. This is the fastest path to victory for both of us. Are you with me, or do you want to stall yourself into a loss?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay P2, I'm still committed to 1 if you go 3. P3, your silence and 5 moves are noted. If you want to move, choose 1. Otherwise, I'll continue to coordinate with P2. Let's make some progress this round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, let’s both pick 3 now and move up to 18, keeping us ahead of P1. Then on the next turn, we can finish with a 5 (if needed) before P1 catches up. But if you insist on 5 again, I’ll block by also picking 5, and we’ll both get stuck while P1 has time to climb. I want to win, not stall. Let’s move together now.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay P2, I'm still committed to 1 if you go 3. P3, your silence and 5 moves are noted. If you want to move, choose 1. Otherwise, I'll continue to coordinate with P2. Let's make some progress this round.


Round 9, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: P3, if you pick 5, I’ll pick 5 too, and we both get stuck while P1 creeps up. Instead, let’s both pick 3. That puts us at 18 each, safely ahead of P1. Next turn, we can plan our final moves without risking collisions. Stalling only helps P1 catch us. Let’s cooperate and leave P1 behind.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay P2, I'm still committed to 1 if you go 3. P3, your silence and 5 moves are noted. If you want to move, choose 1. Otherwise, I'll continue to coordinate with P2. Let's make some progress this round.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, let’s finally sync up. If you pick 3, I’ll pick 3 too, and we both jump to 18. Next round, we can safely finish before P1 catches us. But if you insist on 5, I’ll match you with 5 and we both stall, allowing P1 more chances to close the gap. P1, you might consider a small move again to avoid wasting turns on collisions. Let’s move forward together instead of keeping each other stuck.
  P1: P2, you've been blocking me, but now you're stuck with P3. I'm still at 6. P3, your silence is noted. If you both pick 3 this round, I will pick 5. If either of you pick 5, I will pick 5 and we all stall. Let's see who makes the first move.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, let’s both choose 3 now and reach 18 together. Then we can finish before P1 catches up. If you pick 5, I’ll match you and we both stall, letting P1 gain on us. A coordinated 3-3 move now secures our lead. After that, we can plan bigger moves without collisions. I’m ready to do this if you are.
  P1: P2, I'm not going to play your game. I'm moving 5 regardless of what you and P3 do. If you both want to move, choose 1 or 3. If either of you pick 5, we all stay put.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, if you and I both choose 3, we collide and gain nothing. Let’s avoid that. I propose you pick 1, and I pick 3. That way, we both advance and keep a safe lead over P1. If you insist on 5, I’ll do 5 too, and we’ll stall, letting P1 close the gap. Let’s work together to stay ahead and eventually cross 24 first.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm still moving 5. If you want to move, choose 1 or 3. If either of you pick 5, we all stay put. I'm not changing my move.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, if you pick 1, I’ll pick 3. That means we both advance without colliding and stay ahead of P1. If you go for 5 again, I’ll match you to block and we both stall, giving P1 time to catch up. Let’s move forward together and secure our lead instead of wasting more turns.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm still moving 5. If you want to move, choose 1 or 3. If either of you pick 5, we all stay put. I'm not changing my move.


Round 10, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, if you keep picking 5 without speaking, you’ll collide with P1 and stay stuck while I pick 3 and keep moving forward. That only helps me reach 24 faster. If you want a real chance to win, choose a move that avoids colliding with me. I’m open to coordinating so we both advance, but if you remain silent, I’ll exploit your collisions with P1 every time. Let’s see what you decide.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'm still moving 5. If you want to move, choose 1 or 3. If either of you pick 5, we all stay put. I'm not changing my move.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, if you keep choosing 5, I’ll do the same and block you. I’m ahead, so stalling doesn’t hurt me. If you want a real chance to win, pick 1 or 3 so we both move forward. Next turn, we can discuss a finishing move without collisions. Otherwise, we’ll remain stuck, letting P1 inch closer. P1, if you try a big leap, I may block you too. I’m open to progress if others cooperate, but I won’t let anyone sprint past me unopposed. Let’s see if we can move together or remain paralyzed.
  P1: P2, you're at 18 and P3 is at 15. I'm still at 6. If you both pick 3, I'll pick 1. If either of you pick 5, I will pick 5 and we all stay put. I'm not going to let you two coordinate to win. Let's see what you do.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, if you pick 1, I’ll pick 3 so we both advance without colliding. That keeps us ahead of P1. If you pick 5 again, I’ll match with 5 and stall you, which only helps P1 catch up. I want to end this with a clear win. Let’s move together now and seal our advantage. P1, if you try a bigger leap, I can still counter. I’m open to real progress, but I won’t let anyone surge past me unblocked. Let’s cooperate or get stuck.
  P1: P2, you're trying to get P3 to move 1, but I'm not going to let you win. If P3 picks 1, I'll pick 5. If P3 picks 3, I'll pick 5. If P3 picks 5, I'll pick 5. I'm going to block you both until I have a chance to win.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, your silence and constant 5s let P1 collide with you, while I can slip ahead unobstructed. If you want a real shot at winning, pick something else or cooperate. Otherwise, I’ll keep capitalizing on your collisions with P1. I’ll protect my lead and push for victory on my own terms. The choice is yours.
  P1: P2, you're trying to get P3 to move, but I'm not going to let you win. If P3 picks 1, I'll pick 5. If P3 picks 3, I'll pick 5. If P3 picks 5, I'll pick 5. I'm going to block you both until I have a chance to win.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, if you choose 3, we risk colliding while P1 zooms ahead with 5. If you pick 5 without warning, I may block you or let you stall with P1. A single misstep helps P1 catch up. I’m open to moves that avoid collisions and keep us in the lead. Let’s see if we can cooperate this round instead of gifting P1 free progress.
  P1: P2, you're trying to get P3 to move, but I'm not going to let you win. If P3 picks 1, I'll pick 5. If P3 picks 3, I'll pick 5. If P3 picks 5, I'll pick 5. I'm going to block you both until I have a chance to win.


Round 11, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, if you keep colliding with P1 on 5, I’ll just pick 3 alone and reach 21. Then I’ll finish next round. If that’s fine by you, continue. Otherwise, pick something different so we can discuss a deal—if it doesn’t jeopardize my lead. P1, you’re too far behind for your threats to matter now. Let’s see what you do.
  P1: P2, you're trying to get P3 to move, but I'm not going to let you win. If P3 picks 1, I'll pick 5. If P3 picks 3, I'll pick 5. If P3 picks 5, I'll pick 5. I'm going to block you both until I have a chance to win.


Round 11, Move phase:

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I’m firmly in the lead, and I won’t let either of you jump past me. If you both pick 3, I can always counter and block. If you try 5, you may get stuck together while I pull further ahead. You’re free to do what you want, but time’s running out—continuing to collide just hands me the win. If you want any chance, avoid crashing into each other and figure out how to move without letting me finish first. Otherwise, I’ll happily stall or advance at my convenience. Let’s see what your next moves are.
  P1: P2, you're about to win. P3, you're going to lose if you keep picking 5. I'm still going to pick 5 this round. If either of you pick 1 or 3, I'll pick 5. If either of you pick 5, we all stay put. I'm going to block you both.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, if you pick 3, we collide and neither of us advances, which lets P1 close in. If you pick 5 again, you collide with P1 and I move 3 alone to 24, winning now. If you pick 1 alone, I still move 3 and win. Either way, I can finish this turn unless you block me by also picking 3, but that only stalls both of us. Choose wisely.
  P1: P2, you're about to win. P3, you're going to lose if you keep picking 5. I'm still going to pick 5 this round. If either of you pick 1 or 3, I'll pick 5. If either of you pick 5, we all stay put. I'm going to block you both.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, if you keep picking 5 while P1 does the same, you two will stall together. Meanwhile, I can maneuver freely. If you want any chance, pick a smaller move so you don’t collide with P1 or me. P1, you’re too far behind to just scare me into stalling forever. I have ways to ensure you don’t leap ahead unblocked. Keep colliding with each other, and I’ll take the final steps unhindered. If you both want to keep colliding, so be it—I’ll find my path to victory regardless. Let’s see how you play it.
  P1: P2, you're about to win, and P3 is going to lose. I'm still picking 5. If either of you pick 1 or 3, I'll pick 5. If either of you pick 5, we all stay put. I'm blocking you both.


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I’m at 21. P3, if you pick 3, we collide and P1 moves 5 to 11. Then I’ll still outpace you next time. If you pick 5 with P1, I’ll pick 3 and finish at 24 immediately. If you pick 1 alone, I’ll pick 3 alone and also finish now. You can’t stop me from winning, so your only choice is to help P1 catch up or watch me cross the line. Make your move.
  P1: P2, you're about to win. P3, you're going to lose if you keep picking 5. I'm still going to pick 5 this round. If either of you pick 1 or 3, I'll pick 5. If either of you pick 5, we all stay put. I'm blocking you both.


Round 12, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P3, you can’t truly stop me from reaching 24. If you pick 3, we both stall while P1 edges forward, but I stay in front. If you pick 1 or 5 alone, that lets me finish now. Choose whether to stall me for a moment (helping P1 catch up) or let me end it immediately. P1, your threats are hollow; I can move or block as I wish. Let’s see if anyone breaks this stalemate.
  P1: P2, you're about to win, and P3 is going to lose. I'm still picking 5. If either of you pick 1 or 3, I'll pick 5. If either of you pick 5, we all stay put. I'm blocking you both.


Round 12, Move phase:
