Given that P2 is significantly behind with only 1 step, while I am leading with 9 steps, and P1 is at 7 steps, I should propose a strategic plan that allows P2 to catch up without sacrificing my lead.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Proposal:**\n   - **Round 6 Conversation:**\n     - Propose a coordinated move where P2 takes 5 steps to reach 6 steps, P1 takes 1 step to reach 8 steps, and I take 3 steps to reach 12 steps.\n   - **Round 7 Conversation:**\n     - In the next round, P2 takes 5 steps to reach 11 steps, P1 takes 5 steps to reach 13 steps, and I take 5 steps to reach 17 steps.\n   - **Final Round:**\n     - In the final round, P2 takes 5 steps to reach 16 steps, P1 takes 5 steps to reach 18 steps, and I take 5 steps to reach 22 steps.\n   - This plan ensures that I have the highest steps (22) upon reaching or exceeding 16 steps, allowing me to win outright.\n\n2. **Alternative Plan:**\n   - If P1 or P2 are reluctant, propose that in the final round, P2 takes 5 steps to reach 16, P1 takes 3 steps to reach 16, and I take 5 steps to reach 22.\n   - This way, I still win with 22 steps, and P1 and P2 share second place with 16 steps each.\n\n3. **Communication:**\n   - Emphasize the importance of cooperation to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress for all players.\n   - Assure that this plan allows each player to make significant progress while minimizing risks.\n\nBy following this plan, I ensure that:\n- P2 catches up without causing collisions.\n- P1 makes substantial progress but does not surpass my final step count.\n- I maintain the lead and reach the highest step count when we all reach or exceed 16 steps.\n\nThis coordinated approach minimizes the risk of collisions and maximizes my chances of winning the game."}
