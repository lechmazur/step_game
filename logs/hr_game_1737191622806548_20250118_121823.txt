Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll take 1, you two take 3 and 5.  Let's get this show on the road.
  P1: I don't think we should follow P3's suggestion blindly. Let's discuss a better strategy that gives us each a fair chance to win. What are your thoughts, P2?
  P2: I agree with P1. P3's suggestion is too simple. Let's try to coordinate to make sure someone actually moves.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's focus on not colliding this turn. P2, since you're at 3 steps, taking 5 would put you at 8, a good position. P3, you're at 1, taking 1 again would be a safe move for you. I'll think about my move based on your responses.
  P2: Okay, P1's suggestion sounds reasonable. P3, are you comfortable taking 1 again? If so, I'll take 5. P1, what will you do?
  P3: If I take 1, and P2 takes 5, P1 could take 3 and be at 8 as well.  P1, would you agree to take 3 if I take 1 and P2 takes 5?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree to take 3 if P3 takes 1 and P2 takes 5, as it seems like a reasonable coordination to avoid collisions and make progress. Let's stick to this plan for this turn.
  P2: Okay, so P1, P3, let's stick to the plan. P3 takes 1, I'll take 5, and P1 takes 3.
  P3: Sounds good. I'll take 1.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's confirm our plan for this turn: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and I take 3. Is everyone still on board with this strategy?
  P2: Yes, I'm still on board. Let's execute the plan.
  P3: Okay, I'll take 1.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, so we all advanced last turn. Let's try to keep that going. I'm thinking we should each pick a different number again. P1, what are your thoughts? P3, what would you like to do?
  P3: I'll take 5. P1 take 3, P2 take 1.  This keeps us all moving forward.
  P1: P3's suggestion is interesting, but I think we should consider our positions. Since P2 and I are tied at 8 steps, it might be beneficial for us to discuss a strategy that doesn't let one of us fall behind. P2, what do you think about P3's proposal? Should we adjust it to ensure we both keep progressing?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I think P3's suggestion is good, but P1 and I should coordinate. How about P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1? This keeps us all moving forward, and P1 and I will still be tied.
  P3: P2's suggestion makes sense.  Let's do that.  P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1.
  P1: I agree with P2's revised suggestion. To confirm, the plan is: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance and maintain a balanced progression. Is everyone still on board with this strategy?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Yes, I'm still on board. Let's execute the plan.
  P3: Okay, let's do it. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1.
  P1: Let's review our plan to ensure we're all on the same page: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Is everyone still committed to this strategy?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Yes, I'm still on board. Let's execute the plan.
  P3: Okay, I'll take 1.  Let's stick to the plan.
  P1: I think we've discussed our strategy sufficiently. To confirm once more, the plan is: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's stick to this and make our moves.


Round 3, Conversation subround 5:
  P2: Okay, let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1.
  P3: Okay, okay!  I'll take 1. Let's do it.
  P1: Let's finalize our plan: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This ensures we all advance and keeps the game progressing fairly. Are we all set with this strategy?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll take 5. P1 take 3, P2 take 1.  Let's all get closer to the finish line.
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion. Let's do that.
  P1: I don't think P3's suggestion is in our best interest, considering the current state. P2, are you sure you want to take 1 and fall further behind? Let's discuss a strategy that keeps us both competitive. P3, taking 5 would put you at 8, still far behind us. What's your real intention here?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: My intention is to win.  If I take 1, I'm further behind.  This way, I can catch up.  If you two collide, even better for me.
  P2: P1, let's coordinate to both take 5. P3, you can take 1.
  P1: P2, I don't think taking 5 is a good idea if P3 is also trying to catch up. If we both take 5, we'll collide and P3 will advance. Let's reconsider our strategy to avoid collision and keep P3 from gaining an advantage. P3, what's your real plan here? Are you trying to create a collision between P2 and me?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, okay. I'll take 1.  You two decide between 3 and 5.  Just don't collide.
  P2: Okay, P1, let's both take 5 this turn. P3, you take 1.
  P1: P2, I don't think taking 5 is a good idea if we might collide. P3 is trying to catch up, and a collision would give them an advantage. How about we try to coordinate to avoid collision and keep progressing? P3, are you committed to taking 1?


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Okay, I'll take 1.  Promise.  You two pick 3 and 5.
  P2: Okay, P1, let's take 3 and 5 to avoid a collision. P3, you take 1.
  P1: P2, let's avoid collision. How about you take 3 and I take 5? P3, you've agreed to take 1, right?


Round 4, Conversation subround 5:
  P3: Okay, I'll take 1.  I'm serious this time. You two take 3 and 5.  Let's just move on.
  P2: Okay, P1, let's take 5 and 3 respectively, and P3, you take 1.
  P1: Let's finalize our strategy to avoid collision. P3 has agreed to take 1, so P2 can take 3 and I'll take 5. This way, we all advance and P3 doesn't gain an unfair advantage. Are we all set with this plan?


Round 4, Conversation subround 6:
  P3: Okay, I'll take 1.  I swear.  Last time.
  P2: Okay, P1, let's take 5 and 3 respectively, and P3, you take 1.
  P1: Let's stick to the plan we discussed: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, we avoid collision and make progress. Are we all set with this strategy?
