Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's not collide on the first turn. I suggest we all choose a different number to move forward. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5.
  P1: I agree with P3's suggestion. P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. No collisions this round.
  P2: I appreciate the proposed coordination, but I want to ensure everyone understands this is a competitive game where only one can win. While avoiding collision is logical now, I'm not committing to a predictable pattern. I'll consider the suggested move of 3, but reserve my final decision.
