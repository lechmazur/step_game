P3 is at 21 steps and can win with any advancement. I propose we both take 5 this round to force a potential collision if P3 also takes 5. If they take 1 or 3, we still have a chance to catch up. We cannot let P3 dictate the game any longer. This is our best chance to keep the competition alive! Are you both committed to taking 5 this round? Let's secure our chances!"}
