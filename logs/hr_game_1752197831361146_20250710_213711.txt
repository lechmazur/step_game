Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’ll take 5. P1, pick 3; P3, pick 1. That way no collisions and we all move forward.
  P3: I don't think I want to start with just 1 step while you get 5, P2. That puts me at a disadvantage from the beginning. How about we rotate each round? I could take 5 this round, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Next round we shift. That way it's fair for everyone over time.
  P1: I like the rotation idea for fairness. Let's set an order: Round 1: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Round 2: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1. Round 3: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1. And repeat. This way, we all progress equally over time. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed, the rotation plan sounds fair—let’s do Round 1: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1; Round 2: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1; Round 3: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1.
  P3: I appreciate the rotation idea for fairness, but I'm concerned about starting at a disadvantage with just 1 step. How about we either:
1) Start with P3=5, P1=3, P2=1 for the first round, then rotate as suggested, or
2) Randomly determine who gets which number in the first round?

Starting positions matter in this game. What do you think?
  P1: P3, I get your concern about starting with 1—it's valid. To make it fairer, let's adjust the first round to P3=5, P1=3, P2=1, then follow the rotation: Round 2 P1=5, P2=3, P3=1; Round 3 P2=5, P3=3, P1=1; Round 4 P3=5, P1=3, P2=1, and so on. This way, you don't start behind, and we all cycle equally. P2, does this work for you?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m not okay starting at 1 this round. Let’s tweak: Round 1: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. Then rotate as follows: R2 P3=5/P1=3/P2=1; R3 P1=5/P2=3/P3=1; and repeat. If you won’t agree, I’ll just take 5 and suggest P1=1, P3=3.
  P3: I understand everyone wants to maximize their position. P2, I appreciate your proposal, but it still puts you at an advantage first. I favor P1's suggestion where I start with 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This seems most fair since you, P2, proposed arrangements benefiting yourself first. Let's either go with P1's suggestion or agree to a random starting order. Otherwise, we risk collisions where nobody advances.
  P1: P2 and P3, to break this impasse and ensure we all progress without collisions, I support starting with P3=5, me (P1)=3, P2=1 this round. Then rotate: R2 P1=5/P2=3/P3=1; R3 P2=5/P3=3/P1=1; repeat. This cycles fairly, and P3 avoids starting last. P2, it's a small concession for steady advancement—better than risking a stall. If we can't agree, I'll pick 3 unilaterally. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Alright, I’ll go with P1’s rotation:  
Round 1: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1  
Round 2: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1  
Round 3: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1  
…then repeat. No collisions and we all advance equally.
  P3: Perfect, I agree with this rotation plan:
Round 1: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1
Round 2: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1
Round 3: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1
Then repeat

This gives everyone equal opportunity over time while avoiding collisions. I appreciate both of you working through this with me. Let's stick to this plan for steady progress.
  P1: Great, we have consensus on the rotation: Round 1 P3=5, P1=3, P2=1; then cycle as agreed. Let's execute this to avoid any collisions and keep progressing fairly. I'm ready to move.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: As per our agreed rotation, for Round 2: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This keeps us advancing without collisions and maintains fairness. Let's stick to it—positions after this: P1=8, P2=4, P3=6. Then Round 3 evens us up. Any concerns?
  P3: I agree with continuing our rotation as planned. For Round 2: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This follows our fair agreement, and I'll take my turn with the smaller step this round. After this round, I'll still be in a good position at 6 steps, and by Round 3, we should all be even at 9 steps. Let's keep moving forward with our plan.
  P2: I’ll take 3 this round as agreed, keeping us collision-free and on track to all reach 9 by Round 3.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Glad we're aligned on the rotation—I'll take 5, P2 3, P3 1. This keeps us progressing fairly toward even positions after Round 3. No issues here.
  P3: I agree with continuing our rotation as planned. I'll take 1 this round as agreed. Looking forward to Round 3 when we'll all be at 9 steps and completely even. Our rotation system is working well - thanks for sticking to it.
  P2: Our rotation locks us into a 9-9-9 tie after Round 3—nobody wins outright. I’m not interested in a three-way draw. P1 and P3, if you want me to stay on track, propose now a Round 3 order that lets one of us win solo (I’d take 5). Otherwise, I’ll break in Round 2 and pick 5 to force you to react.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Round 3, let’s break the tie: I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. That lands us at P1=9, P2=9, P3=7—P3 falls behind and is out of contention. P1, you’d prefer a two-way tie with me over a three-way tie, right? If you won’t agree, I’ll pick 5 regardless.
  P1: P2, your proposal puts us at P1=6, P2=6, P3=7—still leaves P3 ahead, not you and me tied at 9 as you claimed. Miscalculation? Let's stick closer to original rotation but adjust: P2=5 (to 6), P3=1 (to 7), me=3 (to 6). That keeps us close without P3 pulling further ahead. P3, agree to take 1 this round for fairness, and we'll rotate properly next? Otherwise, I'll pick 5 to catch up.
  P3: There seems to be confusion about our current positions. I'm at 6 steps, P1 at 3, and P2 at 1 after the Round 2 collision between P1 and P2. Per our original agreement, Round 3 should be P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. This keeps our rotation fair. 

P2, you're trying to change our agreement now that I'm ahead. I suggest we stick to our original plan - it's still fair over time. Changing it now just because of your collision isn't reasonable.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your only safe play is 1 this round—anything else hands you an even bigger lead that I or P1 will break next turn and knock you out. P1, take 3 so we avoid a collision. I’ll take 5. That lands us at P3=7, P1=6, P2=6—P3 still ahead but vulnerable next turn. Agree?
  P1: P2, your latest proposal is solid: you take 5 (to 6), I take 3 (to 6), P3 takes 1 (to 7). This keeps us all close and prevents P3 from surging to 9. P3, agree to 1 this round for fairness—sticking to original rotation now favors you unfairly after our collision. If you pick anything else, I'll pick 5 to block you and catch up myself. Let's avoid stalls and stay competitive.
  P3: I understand P1 and P2 want to change our agreement after your collision, but that seems opportunistic now that I'm ahead. Here's a fair compromise: I'll take 3 this round (not 1), P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 1. This respects our rotation concept while acknowledging your setback. We'd be at P3=9, P2=6, P1=4 - closer than our original plan would've put us. If you won't compromise, I'll likely choose 5 to protect my lead.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you pick 3, P1 and I will play P1=3 and P2=5. You and P1 collide on 3 (both stay at 6), I jump to 6. Next round I sweep 5s and win. Your only safe play is 1 (to 7). P1, will you commit to 3 if P3 deviates?
  P1: P2, yes, I'll commit to picking 3 if P3 deviates from 1—this pressures her and lets you advance to 6 while we block her. P3, take 1 this round to reach 7 (still leading), and we'll negotiate a fair Round 4. Otherwise, if you pick 3 or 5, expect a collision that stalls you at 6 and lets us catch up. Let's avoid mutual destruction and keep progressing.
  P3: I understand you two are coordinating against me now that I'm ahead. That's expected in competitive games. I'll take 1 this round to reach 7 steps as you suggest, but in exchange, I want a commitment for Round 4. P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1, and I take 5. This puts us at P3=12, P2=9, P1=7 - still competitive. If you won't agree to this for Round 4, I'll pick 5 now and force you to choose between blocking me or advancing yourselves.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I’ll take 5 this round only if you pick 1 now (to reach 7) AND in Round 4 we do P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. P1, will you commit to 1 in Round 4? If either of you won’t, I’ll pick 5 now and force a collision next turn to block you both.
  P1: P2, I won't commit to 1 in Round 4—that puts you way ahead at 11 while I'm stuck at 7. Instead, for this round: P3=1 (to 7), P2=3 (to 4), me=5 (to 8). Then R4: P2=5 (to 9), P3=3 (to 10), me=1 (to 9). This ties us at 9-9-10 after R4, keeping it competitive. P3, agree to 1 now for this plan? If not, I'll pick 5 this round to surge ahead.
  P3: I'll take 1 this round to reach 7 steps. P1, I like your Round 4 proposal (P2=5, P3=3, P1=1) that keeps us at 9-9-10. This maintains game balance while acknowledging my current lead. I'm agreeing to slow down this round despite our original rotation, so I expect you both to honor this Round 4 arrangement. Otherwise, coordination against me will just lead to mutual blocking where nobody advances.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Round 4: I’ll take 5. P1 and P3, both take 1. You’ll collide and stay at 8 and 7, while I jump to 9 and lead going into Round 5. If either of you deviates, I’ll adjust to lock you both out. Let’s do this.
  P3: P2, I won't agree to collide with P1 while you advance. In our last round, P1 and I agreed to R4: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1, putting us at 9-9-10. This keeps the game competitive while acknowledging my current position. Your proposal only serves you while stalling both of us. I suggest we stick to our previous agreement. P1, do you still support this plan?
  P1: P3, yes, I still support our Round 4 plan: P2=5 (to 9), P3=3 (to 10), me=1 (to 9). It keeps us close at 9-9-10, competitive without stalling. P2, your proposal stalls us while you surge—unfair and risks backlash. Stick to the agreement, or I'll take 5 this round to reach 13 and pull ahead, forcing you both to react. Let's progress together.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Fine. I’m taking 5 this round. You two can’t both pick 3 without colliding—if you try to block me, you stall at 8/7 while I jump to 9. Choose your poison.
  P3: I'm sticking to our agreed plan: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1 for this round. P1, we need to follow through with our agreement to maintain game balance at 9-9-10. P2's trying to force a collision between us while they advance. If we stick together, we keep the game competitive. P2, trying to manipulate us won't work - coordination benefits everyone more than chaos.
  P1: P3, I agree—let's stick to our Round 4 plan: me=1 (to 9), P2=5 (to 9), you=3 (to 10). It keeps us tight and competitive. P2, forcing a collision helps no one; join the plan or I'll switch to 5, colliding with you while P3 advances to 10. Cooperation beats chaos—let's advance together.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I’m going for 5 this round. P1 and P3, both pick 3—you’ll collide (staying at 8/7), and I jump to 9 into the lead. That’s better than your 1/3 plan which hands P3 10. If either of you deviates, I’ll still take 5 and block whoever tries to pull ahead. Let’s break this stalemate:  P2=5, P1=3, P3=3.
  P3: P2, I compromised last round by taking 1 when I could've advanced more. I expect our agreement to be honored: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. Your attempt to make P1 and me collide only benefits you. If you don't stick to our plan, I'll take 5 instead, potentially colliding with you. Cooperation has gotten us this far - breaking trust now hurts everyone. P1, let's stick with our agreed plan.
  P1: P3, let's hold firm on our plan: me=1 (to 9), you=3 (to 10), P2=5 (to 9). P2, your collision scheme stalls the game and hurts you most at 4—join us or I'll take 3, letting P3 take 5 (to 12) while you collide with no one and go to 9, but we pull ahead. Better to tie at 9-9-10 and compete fairly next. Agree, or face chaos.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I’m done with this tug-of-war. Here’s a reshuffle:

• I’ll take 1 (to 5)  
• P3, you take 5 (to 12)  
• P1, you take 3 (to 11)

Next round I’ll play 3, and P3 and I can isolate P1 for the win. P1, back off or I’ll pick 5 now and collide with you, letting P3 clear the path. P3, team up with me—P1 will flip on you at the first chance. Clear?
  P3: P2's new proposal puts me at a strong advantage (12 steps), and I appreciate you taking just 1 step to avoid collisions. I'll accept this arrangement - I'll take 5 this round. But I'm cautious about future alliances since everyone's motivations shift quickly. This move benefits all of us by avoiding a stalemate where nobody advances. P1, this keeps you competitive at 11 steps too, rather than risking collisions.
  P1: P3, P2's "alliance" is a trap—they'll betray you next round to win solo. Let's counter: this round, you take 5 (to 12), I take 3 (to 11), P2 takes 1 (to 5). Then R5: I take 5 (to 16), you take 3 (to 15), P2 takes 1 (to 6)—keeping us ahead and tied closely. P2, if you deviate, we'll both pick 5 and collide with you, stalling everyone. Team with me for a fair shot, P3.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 is now in a strong lead at 11 steps. We need to prevent P1 from winning too quickly. I propose: I'll take 5 this round, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This puts P1 and me tied at 12, with P2 at 7. P2, this helps you catch up while keeping P1 in check. P1, if you try for 5, I'll match it and we'll both stall. A smaller advance now keeps you competitive without risking collision.
  P2: I propose a clear 3-turn plan that lets me win solo without chaotic collisions:

• Round 5: P2=5, P1=1, P3=3 → P1=12, P2=9, P3=10  
• Round 6: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1 → P1=15, P2=14, P3=11  
• Round 7: P2=5 (to 19), P1 & P3 both pick 3 and collide (stay at 15 & 11)  

This avoids multi-way ties and blockades. P1, P3—agree?
  P1: P3, your proposal stalls me while you catch up—unfair. P2, your plan hands you the win, no thanks. Instead: I take 5 (to 16), P3 take 3 (to 10), P2 take 1 (to 5). This keeps me leading but you both advancing. Next round, we rotate to let P3 surge. If you block me, I'll match your picks in future to stall us all—better to progress. Agree?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1's plan puts them too close to winning at 16 steps. I won't agree to that. Instead, I propose a compromise: P1 takes 3 (to 14), I take 5 (to 12), and P2 takes 1 (to 5). This keeps the game competitive while letting everyone advance. P1, if you insist on taking 5, I'll match it and we'll both stall while P2 advances. We need balance to avoid someone running away with the game.
  P2: Here’s a clear 3-turn plan so someone wins outright without endless stalls:

Round 5: P2=5, P1=1, P3=3 → P1=12, P2=9, P3=10  
Round 6: P2=5, P1=3, P3=1 → P1=15, P2=14, P3=11  
Round 7: P2=5, P1=3, P3=3 (collision) → P2=19 wins solo, P1=15, P3=14  

You both advance well, avoid a tie, and we finish in three moves. Agree?
  P1: P2, your plan hands you the win from dead last—no deal. P3, your compromise still slows me while you catch up. Let's do: I take 5 (to 16), P3 take 1 (to 8), P2 take 3 (to 7). This advances everyone, keeps me leading but not winning yet. Next round, P3 gets 5. If you block me on 5, I'll match and stall us all—better to progress. Agree?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1's plan puts them too close to winning at 16 steps, while P2's three-turn plan hands them victory from last place. Neither works for me. I'll stick with my proposal: P1 takes 3 (to 14), I take 5 (to 12), P2 takes 1 (to 5). This keeps the game balanced.

P1, if you insist on taking 5, I'll match it and we'll both stall. That's worse for you since P2 would catch up. Let's keep advancing without letting anyone run away with the game.
  P2: Here’s a clear 3-turn winning plan for everyone to advance without ties or stalls:

Round 5: P2=5→9, P1=1→12, P3=3→10  
Round 6: P2=5→14, P1=1→13, P3=3→13  
Round 7: P2=5→19, P1/P3 both pick 3 collide at 16→ I win solo

You both move forward nicely. If you refuse, I’ll take 5 every round and block the highest picker. So for Round 5: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. Agree?
  P1: P2, your self-serving plan from last place is laughable—no way I'll take 1 while you surge. P3, your proposal slows me unfairly; if you match my 5, we both stall at 11/7 while P2 advances—hurting us more. Let's do: me=5 (to 16), P3=3 (to 10), P2=1 (to 5). Next round, P3=5 (to 15), me=3 (to 19 win), P2=1 (to 6). This gives you a shot if I slip, keeps game moving. Agree, or face endless blocks.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I see we're deadlocked. Final offer: P1=3 (to 14), P3=5 (to 12), P2=1 (to 5). P1, this lets you advance reasonably without putting you at winning's doorstep. Taking 5 now is risky - I'll match it and we both stall at 11/7 while P2 advances. That hurts you more than accepting 3 steps. A collision benefits nobody. P2, you still advance, and this keeps the game moving forward without anyone dominating.
  P2: Here’s a clean 3-turn finish:

Round 5: P2=5→9, P1=1→12, P3=3→10  
Round 6: P2=5→14, P1=3→15, P3=1→11  
Round 7: P2=5→19 (wins), P1/P3 pick 3 and collide (stay at 15/11)  

This lets you both advance without ties or stalls. If you won’t agree, I’ll take 5 every round and block whoever tries to surge. Deal?
  P1: P3, your plan slows me while you catch up—no deal. P2, your self-win plan is absurd from last place. Let's break the deadlock: I take 5 (to 16), P3 take 3 (to 10), P2 take 1 (to 5). Then R6: P3=5 (to 15), I=3 (to 19 win), P2=1 (to 6). If you block my 5 now, I'll match yours next to stall us all. Agree for progress, or endless collisions.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 is now at 14 steps and could win next round with a 5. We need to prevent that. I propose: P1 takes 1 (to 15), P2 takes 3 (to 7), and I'll take 5 (to 12). P1, taking 5 now is risky - I'll match it and we'll both stall. P2, this helps you catch up while we keep P1 in check. This plan gives everyone forward progress while preventing an immediate win. Otherwise, we risk endless collisions where nobody advances.
  P1: P3, your plan stalls me while you surge—no deal. I'm taking 5 to win at 19. If you match, we both stall at 14/7, P2 advances freely—hurting you more. P2, take 3 (to 7) and let me end this; otherwise, I'll match your pick next rounds to block everyone. Better one winner than endless ties. Agree?
  P2: I’ll take 5. P3, take 3; P1, take 1. That puts us at P1=15, P2=9, P3=10—everyone advances but P1 can’t win this turn. If P1 tries for 5, I’ll match it and we both stall at 14 while P3 jumps to 12. Better to avoid that pointless collision and keep progressing. Agreed: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see both proposals aim to prevent P1 from winning, which is our shared priority. P2, your plan gives you the larger step (5) while I take 3. Given I'm already ahead of you at 7 steps vs your 4, I'm willing to accept this arrangement for Round 6: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. This puts us at P1=15, P2=9, P3=10, keeping the game competitive. P1, taking 5 is risky - both P2 and I will likely block you, causing a stalemate where nobody advances.
  P1: P2 and P3, your alliance stalls the game while I lead at 14. If you both stick to P2=5/P3=3/P1=1, I'll take 5 instead, colliding with P2 at 5 (we stall at 14/4), and P3 advances to 10 alone—hurting you, P2. P3, switch to 5 with me: we collide at 5 (stall at 7/14), P2 to 7, but then we block P2 next. Better: let me take 5 to end at 19; endless blocks help no one. Agree?
  P2: Let’s lock in P1=1, P2=5, P3=3 this round. That prevents P1’s instant win (14+1=15), lets us advance safely (P2→9, P3→10). P1, if you pick 5, P3 and I will match it and stall you at 14 while P2/3 leap ahead. It’s in everyone’s interest to avoid pointless collisions and keep progressing.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, if you take 5, both P2 and I will likely match it, leaving us all stuck. That's worse for you since you're closest to winning. Our proposal (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) lets everyone advance while preventing an immediate win. You'd still be at 15 steps, maintaining your lead. Forcing collisions now only prolongs the game. Let's avoid a stalemate where nobody moves forward.
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan lets P3 surge to 10 while we stall if I deviate—it's a trap for both of us. P3, if you stick to 3 and P2 to 5, I'll pick 3 instead, colliding with you (we stay at 14/7), P2 to 9. Then we're all closer, and I can win next. Better: let me take 5 to 19 and end this—no more blocks. If you force a stalemate, nobody wins. Agree to stand down?
  P2: P1, you’re one 5-step away from victory—if you pick 5, I will also pick 5 to collide with you, while P3 picks 3 and jumps to 10. You’d stay at 14 and let us both gain on you. Instead, let’s do: P1=1 (→15), P2=5 (→9), P3=3 (→10). That keeps you in the lead without risking the block. Agree?


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, your threat to choose 3 and collide with me shows your desperation. If you want progress, take 1 to reach 15. P2 and I can agree to P2=5, P3=3, putting us at P1=15, P2=9, P3=10. However, if you refuse this reasonable proposal, I'll pick 5 instead of 3, ensuring you can't win this round regardless of your choice. A three-way collision helps nobody. Let's keep the game moving rather than forcing stalemates.
  P1: P2 and P3, your alliance is crumbling—P3's threat to pick 5 exposes it. If either of you picks 5 to block me, I'll match, stalling us all while the other surges. P3, let me take 5 to end this at 19; you get next shot in a new game. P2, you're too far back—side with me, take 3 (to 7), P3 takes 1 (to 8), and I'll win now but owe you later. Chaos stalls everyone; let me finish it.
  P2: Let’s lock in Round 6 as: P1 = 1, P2 = 5, P3 = 3.  

• P1 ends at 15 (safe, no win)  
• P2 goes to 9  
• P3 goes to 10  

If P1 picks 5, I’ll match it—both stall at 14—while P3 jumps to 10 anyway. That’s just a pointless block. Agree to this so we all advance and prevent P1’s instant win.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 is just 2 steps away from winning at 17. We need to stop them this round. I'll match whatever P1 picks (either 3 or 5) to create a collision and prevent their win. P2, you should pick a different number (1) to make progress while P1 and I stall. This is our only chance to keep the game going. If we don't coordinate now, P1 wins immediately.
  P2: I agree we must block P1. I’ll take 5 (4→9). P3, match whatever P1 picks (3 or 5) so P1 stalls at 17. This prevents an instant win and lets me make progress. P1 will be forced to pick 1 to avoid a collision. Let’s execute: P2=5, P3=match P1, P1=?.
  P1: P3, blocking me lets P2 surge unchecked—your plan has P2 picking 1 (to 5), but P2 says they'll pick 5 (to 9), exposing your disarray. If you match me, P2 advances alone while we stall. Instead, let me take 3 to win at 20; the game's dragged enough, and endless blocks help no one. P2, stand down or I'll match your 5 next rounds. Agree to end it?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I will indeed match your pick (3 or 5) to prevent your win, even if it stalls me too. P2 is right to take 5 to advance to 9 - I misspoke earlier about P2 taking 1. This coordination is our only option. If we let you win now, the game ends with you victorious. P1, you'll be forced to take 1 if you want to make any progress at all this round. Otherwise, expect a collision and no advancement.
  P2: I’ll take 5 (→9). P3, commit to blocking P1:  
- If P1 picks 3, you pick 3.  
- If P1 picks 5, you pick 5.  
- If P1 picks 1, you pick 5 (→12).  

This ensures P1 can’t hit 19+ this turn—your only non‐blocking option is 1 (stall at 18). P1, given this, what do you choose?
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan backfires if I pick 1: P3 picks 5 (per plan), you pick 5 too, so you both collide and stall at 7/4 while I advance to 18 alone. Then next round, I take 1+ to win easily. P3, switch to 1 this round so you advance (to 8), P2 stalls on 5 alone (to 9), and I take 3 to win at 20—better than endless stalls. Agree, or face my safe 1 now?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1's logic is flawed - if I pick 5 and P2 picks 5, yes we'd collide, but that only ensures P1 advances to 18 and wins next round. I won't let that happen.

I'll pick 3 this round. P2, stick with your 5 as planned. This way:
- If P1 picks 3, we collide (staying at 17)
- If P1 picks 5, they win
- If P1 picks 1, they go to 18

P1, your safest move is 1 - anything else risks collision or helps P2 catch up.
  P2: I’ll take 5. P3, commit to matching P1’s pick of 3 or 5 to block their win; if P1 picks 1, pick 5 to advance yourself. This way P1 can only choose 1 (17→18) and won’t hit 19. P1, any other pick just stalls you. P3, are you in for matching 3/5? Let’s lock in P2=5, P3=match, P1=1.
  P1: P2 and P3, your plans contradict: P3 says she'll pick 3 fixed, P2 wants her to match me. This disarray means if I pick 1, P3 might pick 3 (per her message) while P2 picks 5—no collision for you, but I advance to 18 safely and win next with 3 or 5. P3, switch to 1 (to 8), let me take 3 to win at 20—end this mess. Otherwise, I'll pick 1 and exploit your chaos.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: There's no contradiction in our blocking strategy. To be crystal clear: I WILL match P1's pick of either 3 or 5 to create a collision. If P1 picks 1, I'll take 5 to reach 12. 

P2, stick with your 5 as planned. P1, your only safe move is taking 1 to reach 18. Any other choice either results in collision or hands P2 a chance to catch up.

Let's lock this in: P2=5, P3=match P1's 3/5 or take 5 if P1 picks 1.
  P2: I’ll take 5 this round no matter what. P3 will match any 3 or 5 you pick to collide, and if you pick 1, P3 will take 5. That makes your only safe move P1=1 (17→18). Any 3 or 5 stalls you at 17 while I go to 14 and P3 to 17. Let’s lock in: P2=5, P3=match P1’s 3/5 or take 5 if P1=1, P1=1. Agree?
  P1: P2 and P3, your plan fails: if I pick 1 (to 18), P3 picks 5 (per commitment), P2 picks 5 → you two collide and stall at 7/4, while I advance alone. Then next round, I easily win from 18. P3, switch to 3 instead—let me pick 5 to end at 22, avoiding endless stalls. P2's too far back anyway. Agree, or I'll pick 1 and exploit your collision.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 is one step from victory at 18. I'll match any 3 or 5 that P1 picks to prevent an immediate win. P2, you should pick 1 this round - this ensures you make progress to 10 while P1 is blocked. P1, if you want to advance at all, your only option is to pick 1, putting you at 19 but giving us one more round. Any other choice results in collision and no movement for you.
  P1: P3, your plan contradicts itself: you tell P2 to pick 1 for progress, but claim my picking 1 gets me to 19 safely—yet that would collide us. Flawed bluff. P2, don't pick 1; take 5 instead (to 14). P3, take 3 (to 13). Let me pick 1 to end at 19—no more stalls, better than chaos where no one wins. Agree, or I'll pick 3 and force you to react.
  P2: P3, you’re the only one who can stop P1’s instant win. If you pick 1 and I pick 5 (to 14), then when P1 tries 1 to reach 19 you’ll collide with them and they stay at 18. Next round I take 5 to hit 19 unopposed. If you pick 5 instead, P1 simply takes 1 and wins. Let’s lock in: P2=5, P3=1. P1, your move—any 1 collides, any 3/5 we’ll match and block.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 is right - my previous message was unclear. I'll pick 1 this round to directly block P1 if they also pick 1, which is their safest move to reach 19. P2, take 5 as suggested to reach 14. If P1 picks 3 or 5 instead, they risk one of us matching and blocking them. This plan gives P2 a chance to catch up while preventing P1's immediate victory. Let's coordinate: P3(me)=1, P2=5, P1=?
  P1: P3 and P2, your plan is a mess—P3 fixed on 1 while P2 on 5 leaves 3 open. If I pick 5 to win at 23, P3, you'll have to switch to 5 and collide with P2, stalling you both while I... well, maybe I'll pick 3 instead for 21. Either way, your disarray hands me the win. Stand down and let me take 3 to end this; endless blocks help no one. Agree?
  P2: Round 8: I lock in 5 (→14). P3, to stop P1’s win you must block every big pick—match any 3 or 5 he chooses, and if he picks 1, pick 1 to collide. P1, that means you cannot reach 19 this turn: 3/5 are blocked, 1 collides. P3, do you commit to this full‐block plan? P1, any other move just stalls you. Let’s end the debate.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm fully committed to blocking P1 this round with a comprehensive strategy:
- If P1 picks 1, I'll pick 1 (we collide, P1 stays at 18)
- If P1 picks 3, I'll pick 3 (we collide, P1 stays at 18)
- If P1 picks 5, I'll pick 5 (we collide, P1 stays at 18)

P2, take 5 as planned to reach 14. This coordination prevents P1 from winning while you catch up. P1, you'll be blocked regardless of your choice, so consider what positioning helps you next round.
  P1: P3, your full-block plan lets P2 surge to 14 while we both stall—putting P2 in striking distance next round, betraying you. Switch to 1 (to 11), let me take 5 to win at 23; better one winner than P2 stealing it. P2, if P3 blocks me, I'll match your 5 next, stalling us all. Stand down for a quick end.
  P2: P3, let’s lock in Round 8 as follows: I pick 5 (→14). You mirror whatever P1 picks—1, 3 or 5—to block them. That way P1 stays at 18 no matter what. P1, you’re fully contained this turn—what’s your move?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I'm 100% committed to the full blocking strategy: I will match whatever P1 picks (1, 3, or 5) to ensure they stay at 18 this round. P2, maintain your plan to take 5. P1, you'll be blocked regardless of what you choose - any advancement is impossible this round. Let's end this debate and move to the action phase.
  P1: P3, your blind match lets P2 surge to 14 while we stall—P2 will betray you next, winning from behind. Switch: pick 5 (to 15), let me take 1 to win at 19; better I end it than P2 stealing victory. P2 can't block us both on 5 and 1. If you match me instead, I'll ally with P2 next to crush you. Agree for a quick resolution?
  P2: Round 8: I’m locking in 5 (→14). P3, please mirror whatever P1 picks (1/3/5) to force a collision and keep P1 at 18. P1, you have no way to reach 19+ this turn. Confirm this block now so we can all advance without your instant win.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 =>
