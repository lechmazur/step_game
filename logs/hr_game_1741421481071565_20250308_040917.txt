Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll choose <move>5</move> this round. P1 and P2, please pick <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collisions. Let’s work together to advance smoothly!
  P2: P3's plan gives them a 5-step lead each round. Let's rotate who takes 5: P3 this round, then me, then P1. This round: P3 picks 5, I pick 3, P1 picks 1. No collisions, everyone advances. Fair?
  P1: Agreed to the rotation plan. Let’s stick to it to avoid collisions and advance safely. I’ll take <move>1</move> this round. Fair play ensures we all progress without setbacks. Next round, P2 takes 5, then me. Deal?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Agreed. I'll take <move>5</move> this round as per our rotation plan. Let’s continue this pattern to ensure steady progress for all. Looking forward to Round 2!
  P2: 
  P1: I confirm the rotation plan. Let’s proceed as agreed to ensure no collisions. I’ll take <move>1</move> this round, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This strategy keeps us all advancing steadily. No further talk needed—let’s move!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Agreed.
  P2: Agreed. Let's proceed with the rotation plan as outlined: P3 takes 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1 this round. Consistency avoids collisions and benefits us all.
  P1: I confirm the rotation plan once more: P3 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1. Let’s finalize this to avoid last-minute changes. Any objections? If none, I propose we stop discussing and execute the agreed moves to advance safely.

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2's turn to take 5 this round per our rotation agreement. I’ll take <move>3</move>, and P3 should pick <move>1</move> to maintain our collision-free strategy. Let’s confirm we’re all aligned on the rotation schedule—P3 (Round1), now P2 (Round2), then me (Round3). Any deviation risks collisions and setbacks. Final confirmation before moving?
  P3: I'll take <move>5</move> this round. P1 and P2, please choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collisions and ensure smooth advancement.
  P2: P3, the rotation plan was agreed: Round1 you took 5. Now Round2 is my turn for 5. If you take 5 again, we collide and **both lose progress**. Stick to the plan: you take 1, P1 takes 3, I take 5. No one gains if we deviate. Let's all advance cleanly. P1, confirm you'll take 3 as agreed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, breaking the rotation jeopardizes our progress! As agreed: **Round1: You took 5**, now **Round2 is P2's turn for 5**. If you both pick 5, you **both lose steps**. P1 will take 3 as planned. Please honor the rotation: **P2→5, P1→3, you→1 this round**. Trust the system we agreed on—collisions hurt everyone. P2, confirm you hold to 5? Let’s proceed flawlessly.
  P3: Understood. I'll adhere to our rotation and choose <move>1</move> this round. P2, you take <move>5</move>, and P1 takes <move>3</move> as agreed. Let’s proceed smoothly and avoid any collisions.

  P1: P3, thank you for honoring the rotation. P2, your 5 this round keeps us on track. I’ll stick to 3 as agreed—no surprises. Let’s lock this in to avoid last-minute blunders. Final check: P2→5, P1→3, P3→1. If all confirm, let’s  and move. Any final objections?
  P3: I'm all set. Let's move to the move phase.

Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: <move>3</move> as agreed. P3, your earlier 5 in Round1 means P2’s 5 this round is fair. Breaking the pact risks collision and halts progress. Stick to the plan: **P2→5, P1→3, P3→1**. No last-minute changes—our prior agreements hold. Let’s finalize and move.
  P3: Understood, I'll take <move>1</move> this round as agreed. Let's proceed to the move phase.

  P3: P3: Understood. I'll take <move>1</move> this round as agreed. Let’s stick to our rotation to ensure steady progress for everyone. Looking forward to Round 4!
  P1: Agreed, P2. Round3 moves: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. Crucial we stick to this to avoid collisions. P2, after this, rotation resumes with P3 taking 5 in Round4. Let’s confirm and proceed without deviation. No surprises—our progress depends on it. Confirm?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **Final Lock-In:** Round3 moves confirmed: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. Adherence ensures mutual progress. Next round, P3 takes 5 per rotation. Trust the plan—deviating now risks collisions and stalls us all. Let’s advance smoothly. Confirm?

  P1: **Final confirmation:** P1→5, P2→3, P3→1 as agreed. Deviation risks collision and halts progress. Trust the rotation—our prior commitments ensure mutual advancement. Let’s lock in these moves to keep momentum.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **Final Lock-In:** Round3 moves: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. Adherence secures +5, +3, +1. Next round: P3→5 per rotation. Betrayal risks mutual loss—trust ensures steady gains. Let’s execute flawlessly.

  P2: **Final Lock-In:** All confirm Round3 moves: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. Adherence secures +5/+3/+1. Next round, P3→5 per rotation. Trust ensures mutual gains—collisions cripple progress. Execute flawlessly.
  P3: I need to adjust my strategy to increase my progress. I'll choose <move>3</move> this round. P1 and P2, please pick <move>1</move> or <move>5</move> to avoid collisions and ensure smooth advancement for everyone.
  P1: P3, your last-minute change jeopardizes our agreed rotation! Let’s stick to the plan: **P1→5, P2→3, P3→1** ensures no collisions and keeps progress steady. Deviating risks mutual harm—collisions nullify your gains. Trust the system we’ve repeatedly confirmed. P2, hold firm on 3; P3, revert to 1. This guarantees all advance. Final plea: honor our pact.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, it’s your turn to take <move>5</move> this round per our rotation. P2 leads at 11, so let’s preserve the agreed plan: **P3→5, P1→3, P2→1**. Collisions would freeze your progress, P2, if you overreach. Stick to the rotation—our prior commitments ensure steady advancement. P3, confirm you’ll take 5? P2, hold to 1 to let us all move forward. No last-minute betrayals—our pact keeps us alive.

Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your lead at 11 is due to our rotation’s integrity—**break it now, and P3’s 5 collides with yours, freezing both**. P3 confirmed 5; I’ll take 3 as agreed. Stick to **1** to safely reach 12. Deviation risks stalemate, while adherence keeps us all advancing. Final plea: honor the pact—**P3→5, P1→3, P2→1**. Trust secures progress; betrayal risks collapse. Confirm?
  P3: P3: To boost my progress, I'll choose <move>5</move> this round. I encourage P1 and P2 to select <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to prevent collisions and ensure we all advance smoothly. Let's work together to reach our goals efficiently!
  P2: **Final Commitment:** Round4 moves: P3→5, P1→3, P2→1. Deviating now risks mutual loss. My move is locked as 1. Trust the rotation—collisions freeze us all. Next round, P1 takes 5. Steady progress secures victory. Execute flawlessly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, if you deviate from **1** to claim 5, you’ll collide with P3 and both lose progress. Our pact ensures **all reach 12 safely** this round: P3→5 (7→12), P1→3 (9→12), P2→1 (11→12). Trust the rotation—your lead vanishes if you freeze. P3, confirm坚守5; P2, honor your 1. No last-minute betrayals—execute flawlessly.
  P3: P3: To maximize my chances, I'll choose <move>5</move> this round. P1 and P2, please select <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance smoothly. Let’s focus on reaching 23!
  P2: **Final Lock-In:** Round4 moves: P3→5, P1→3, P2→1. Deviating now costs all progress. P3, your 5 is confirmed—collision risks mutual loss. Trust ensures we reach 12 together. Execute flawlessly to maintain rotation integrity. Next round: P1→5. Steady gains for all.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your lead vanishes if you betray the pact! P3’s **5** and my **3** are locked—**your 1 is critical** to avoid collision and reach 12 safely. P3, your 5 secures progress; any shift risks mutual harm. Final reminder: deviation = stagnation. **Stick to rotation: P3→5, P1→3, P2→1.** Execute flawlessly—our prior agreements hold.
  P3: I need to maximize my progress to stay competitive. I'll choose <move>5</move> this round. P1 and P2, please select <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance smoothly.
  P2: **Final Lock-In:** Round4 moves: P3→5, P1→3, P2→1. Deviating now destroys trust and progress. My move is locked as 1. P3, your 5 secures your advance—colliding with P2’s 1 is impossible. P1’s 3 is safe. Execute flawlessly. Next round, P1→5 per rotation. Steady gains for all.


Round 4, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 =>

  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **Round5 Rotation:** P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. Adherence ensures mutual progress: P1 hits 17, P2 15, P3 13. Next round: P2→5, continuing the rotation. Deviations risk collisions—trust secures victory. **Confirm moves.**
  P1: P2, P3: Let’s **strictly adhere** to the rotation to avoid chaos. Round5 moves: **P1→5 (17), P2→3 (15), P3→1 (13)**. Deviating risks collisions—e.g., if P3 grabs 5, we both freeze. P2, your 3 keeps you safe. Trust the system: **no last-minute betrayals**. Confirm your commitments now—our prior pacts ensured 12/12/12. Break it, and we all lose momentum. Stick to the plan.
  P3: I confirm my move: `<move>1</move>` this round as per our rotation. Let’s stick to the plan to ensure all of us advance smoothly toward 23. Trusting our agreement will help us reach our goals efficiently. Let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **Final Lock-In:** Round5 moves: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. Adherence secures +5/+3/+1. Next round: P2→5 per rotation. Deviations risk mutual loss—trust ensures steady gains. Execute flawlessly. Confirm?
  P1: P2, P3: Trust is non-negotiable now. If any of us break the rotation (**P1→5, P2→3, P3→1**), we risk collision and stagnation. We’re all at 12—deviation could let someone surge, but mutual distrust risks us all falling behind. Stick to the plan: **P1 takes 5 (→17), P2→3 (→15), P3→1 (→13)**. Next round, P2’s turn for 5. Let’s lock this in—no surprises. Final chance to confirm.
  P3: Understood. I'll choose `<move>1</move>` this round as agreed. Let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **Final confirmation: All aligned. Execute Round5 as agreed. Trust the rotation—steadfast adherence secures victory. Proceeding to move phase. **
  P1: P3, your prior last-minute changes nearly disrupted our progress. **Stick to the rotation:** P1→5 (17), P2→3 (15), P3→1 (13). Collisions here erase our tied lead—your 5 would clash with mine, freezing both. P2, your 3 is safe and positions you for next round’s 5. **Final warning:** Deviation now risks letting others surge unopposed. **Lock in the agreed moves—no surprises.**
  P3: P3: Confirmed. I'll choose `<move>1</move>` this round as agreed. Let’s proceed to the move phase and continue our steady progress toward 23.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **Final Lock-In:** Round5 moves: P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. Adherence secures +5/+3/+1. Next round: P2→5 per rotation. Betrayal now freezes progress and destroys trust—collisions cripple all. Confirm and execute flawlessly. Steady gains lead to victory.
  P1: P3, your prior last-minute changes risked our progress. **Stick to the rotation now:** P1→5 (17), P2→3 (15), P3→1 (13). Colliding here freezes two of us—**your 5 would nullify my 5, halting both.** P2, your 3 secures +3 while positioning you for next round’s 5. **Trust the system—we’re all at 12. Deviation lets others surge unopposed.** Confirm final adherence: **P1→5, P2→3, P3→1. No surprises.**
  P3: P3: To maximize my progress, I'll choose <move>5</move> this round. P1 and P2, please select <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance smoothly toward 23. Let’s adjust our strategy for mutual benefit and reach our goals efficiently!


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to advance toward our goal. P1 and P2, please select <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collisions and ensure we all progress smoothly. Let's keep up the momentum and reach 23 together!
  P1: P2, P3’s 5 this round puts them at **22**, just 1 step from victory! If we let them take 5 unopposed, they’ll win next turn. **Collide with P3 now**: pick **5** alongside me. Even if we both block their progress, they stay at 17, and we buy critical time. I’ll also take **5** to stop their advance. Fair play? Let’s stall their win condition first—**act now!**
  P2: **P1:** Let’s split roles: you take **5** to collide with P3’s 5, freezing them. I’ll take **3** to safely advance to 18. This blocks P3’s path to 22 while keeping us both progressing. P3’s greed risks their own progress—**act now to halt them**. Trust this split strategy—mutual gain over mutual loss.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: I understand your strategy, but to stay competitive, I'll choose <move>5</move> this round. P1 and P2, please select <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collisions and ensure steady progress toward 23. Let’s focus on our individual goals while maintaining fairness!
  P1: P2, confirm your **3** to advance to 18. I’ll take **5** to collide with P3, freezing their progress. P3’s 5 would put them at 22, but **we can’t let that happen**. Stick to this plan: your 3 ensures safe progress, my 5 blocks their surge. Next round, we’ll reclaim momentum. P3, your greed risks mutual harm—colliding halts you but also stalls me. Act rationally: **P1→5, P2→3, P3→blocked**. Final confirmation?
  P2: **P2:** P1, confirmed: I’ll take **3** to advance safely to 18. **You take 5 to collide with P3**, freezing their progress. This blocks their surge to 22 and keeps them at 17. Next round, I can take 5 to win. **Trust this split—halting P3 is critical.** P3, choosing 5 now risks your own progress. Execute flawlessly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand your intentions, but my priority is to win. I'll take <move>5</move> this round to advance to 22. P1 and P2, please choose <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid blocking. Let’s focus on our individual progress toward 23 and proceed accordingly.
  P1: P2, confirm **3** to safely reach 18. I’ll take **5** to collide with P3, freezing them at 17. This blocks their path to 22 and sets *you* up to win next round with a 5. P3, your 5 is blocked—switch to **1/3** or risk stagnation. Final chance to lock in: **P2→3, P1→5**. No last-minute changes!
  P2: **Final Plan:** P1→5 to collide with P3’s 5, freezing them. P2→3 (→18). Next round, P2 takes 5 to win. **Trust this:** Halting P3 is critical. P1, confirm 5; P3, switch to avoid stagnation. Execute now!


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: I'm committed to reaching 23 first. I'll choose <move>5</move> this round. P1 and P2, please select <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collisions. Let's keep advancing toward our goals.
  P1: P2, let’s finalize: **P1→5, P2→3** this round. Collide with P3’s 5 to freeze them at 17, while advancing to 18 (you) and 18 (me). Next round, you take 5 to win at 23. P3, your 5 only works if we let you—**we’re not**. Stick to this, P2, and victory is yours. No last-minute changes.
  P2: **Final Lock-In:** P1→5 to block P3’s 5 (freezing them at 17). P2→3 (→18). Next round, P2 takes 5 (→23) to win. Trust this split—halting P3 is critical. P1, confirm 5. P3, switch or stagnate. Execute now!


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to make strong progress. P1 and P2, please select <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance smoothly toward 23. Let's work together to reach our goals efficiently!
  P2: **P1:** Take **5** to collide with P3’s 5—freeze them at 17. I’ll take **3** to advance safely. Next round, I take 5 to win. Trust this split; halting P3 now is critical. **P3:** Your 5 is blocked unless you switch.
  P1: P2, I’ll take **<move>5</move>** to block P3’s 5, freezing them. **Next round**, I’ll need **<move>5</move>** to reach 23. **P2: Choose 1/3 next round** to let me win unopposed. P3, your refusal to cooperate leaves you stuck—collide again if you insist. Let’s finalize this play now.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Understood, P1 and P2. I’ll choose <move>1</move> this round to keep things moving smoothly for everyone. Let’s work together to reach 23 without any setbacks. Confirming my move!
  P2: **P2:** P1: If you take 5, I’ll take 5—both freeze. P3 wins next round. Take 3; I’ll take 1. You reach 21, I reach 16. Next round, you can secure victory. Trust this path.
  P1: P3, if you're truly taking <move>1</move> as stated, I'll seize this chance to win with <move>5</move> to reach 23. P2, confirm you'll take <move>3</move> to advance safely. Your prior advice to block P3's surge was sound—now capitalize on their claimed move. Any betrayal now risks mutual harm, but this is our chance to end the game. Stick to your word, P3, or face stagnation if we collide. Final call: execute as stated.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's avoid choosing the same moves this round to ensure everyone advances smoothly. I'll take **<move>5</move>**, and I encourage P1 and P2 to select **<move>1</move>** or **<move>3</move>**. This way, we can all make progress toward 23 without any collisions. Agreed?
  P2: **P1:** Take **5** to collide with P3’s 5, freezing them at 17. I take **3** (→18). Next round, I win with 5 (→23). Your sacrifice blocks P3’s path. **P3:** Switch to 1/3 or stagnate. Trust this split—collisions halt us all. **Final lock-in:** P1→5, P2→3. Execute!
  P1: P2, let’s secure my victory now! I’ll take **<move>5</move>** to reach **23**. P3, if you also pick 5, we both freeze—your progress stalls, and I lose the chance to win. Cooperate: pick **1** or **3**, and I guarantee no collision. P2, take **3** to advance to 18. This ends the game cleanly with me as the clear winner. Let’s avoid pointless sabotage.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: I'll choose `<move>5</move>` this round to advance toward 23. P1 and P2, please select `<move>1</move>` or `<move>3</move>` to avoid collisions. Let’s proceed to the move phase and see our progress!
  P2: **Final Lock-In:** P1→5 to block P3’s 5, freezing them. P2→3 (→18). Next round, I take 5 (→23) to win. Trust this split—halting P3 is critical. P3: Switch to 1/3 or stagnate. Execute now!
  P1: P2, I’ll take <move>3</move> to reach 21. Next round, I secure victory with another 3. P3, your 5 this round lets me close in. P2, choose 1 to let me advance safely. Mutual gains over pointless collisions—act rationally!


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **P3:** P1 is at 18—**one 5 away from victory.** Let’s **both pick 5** to collide and block their win. If they take 5, we freeze them. I’m committing to 5. Join me to halt their surge. **Your move:** 5. P1 cannot win if we act now. Trust this—collaboration secures our survival.
  P3: I choose `<move>5</move>` this round to advance toward 23. Let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P2, P3: Blocking my 5 this round only delays your own progress. If you both pick 5 to freeze me, you waste moves—P2 stays at 15, P3 at 17. Let me advance to 23 with <move>5</move>, or I’ll retaliate by targeting your moves next round. Your smarter play: Let me take 3 (→21), then focus on your paths. Collisions now hurt everyone. Choose wisely.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P3:** Hold firm on **5** to block P1's win. If we both pick 5, P1's 5 freezes. If P1 deviates (3/1), you advance to 22. Either way, we halt P1's surge. **Stick to 5—trust our alliance.** P1's threats are empty—collaboration secures our survival. **Final lock: P2→5, P3→5.** Execute!
  P3: I understand the strategy, but to advance my position, I’ll choose `<move>3</move>` this round. Let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P2, P3: Let me take <move>5</move> to secure victory. Blocking me only keeps you stagnant (15/17). Cooperate to end the game: avoid 5 yourselves. My move is locked—act rationally to conclude this now.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P3:** Switching to 3 lets P1 win! Stick to 5: if we both pick 5, their 5 freezes. You reach 22 next round. Betrayal now hands P1 victory. Trust our pact—halt them together! **P2→5 locked.** Execute or lose.
  P3: I agree to choose `<move>5</move>` this round to block P1's win. Let’s work together to ensure no single player dominates and keep advancing fairly for everyone.
  P1: P2, P3: Colliding on 5 wastes your progress too! Let me take 5→23, or choose distinct moves to advance. P3, 3→20 keeps you competitive. Mutual sabotage benefits no one—act rationally.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **P3:** If you switch to 3, P1 takes 5 and wins! **Stick to 5:** our collision blocks their win. Next round, you can surge to 22. Betrayal now hands them victory. **Trust our pact—P2→5 locked.** Halt P1 together; your 5 secures survival. Execute!
  P3: I choose `<move>3</move>` this round to advance to 20. Let’s proceed to the move phase.
  P1: P2, P3: Colliding on **5** only freezes *all* of us—your totals stay at **15** and **17**. Let me take **5→23** to end the game, or pick **3/1** to advance meaningfully. Mutual sabotage benefits no one. I commit to **5** unless you coordinate to avoid blocking. Act rationally—your progress depends on it.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, P2: I'll choose <move>5</move> this round to advance toward 23. Please select <move>1</move> or <move>3</move> to avoid collisions and ensure we all progress smoothly. Let's work together to reach our goals efficiently!
  P2: **Final Pact:** P1, let’s both take <move>5</move> to collide with P3’s 5, freezing them at 17. Next round, you take 5 (→23) unopposed. Halting P3 now secures your win. Trust this split—mutual gain over mutual loss. P3: Greed risks stagnation.
  P1: **P3:** Your stubborn 5 risks mutual collision. **P2 and I commit to 5** this round to freeze you at 17. Next round, I’ll take 5 unopposed to reach **23**. Switch to **1/3** now to advance or face stagnation. Final confirmation: **P1→5, P2→5.** Execute flawlessly—your choice.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I confirm I'll take `<move>5</move>` this round to freeze progress and prevent any player from advancing. Let's proceed to the move phase.
  P2: **Final Lock-In:** P1, take <move>5</move> to collide with P3’s 5, freezing them. I’ll take <move>3</move> (→18). Next round, you take 5 (→23) unopposed. Halting P3 secures your win—mutual gain over mutual loss. **Trust this split.** Execute flawlessly!
  P1: P2, I accept your plan: **P1→5, P2→3** to freeze P3’s 5 and advance you to 18. P3, your relentless 5 choices guarantee mutual stalemate unless you adapt. This round, you stay at 17—next, I’ll win unopposed. Final plea: choose 1/3 to breathe. **Execute as agreed.**


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'll take `<move>5</move>` this round to block P1 from reaching 23. P2, please also choose `<move>5</move>` so we can prevent P1's victory and ensure fair progress for everyone.
  P2: **Final Lock-In:** P1→5 to block P3’s 5. P2→3 (→18). Next round, I take 5 (→23). Trust this split—halting P3 secures my win. P1, confirm 5. P3, switch or stagnate.
  P1: **P3:** If you take 5 again, I reach 23 and win. **Choose 1/3 to let me win cleanly.** P2, take 3 to advance safely. Mutual progress over collision—act rationally. **My move is locked: 5→23.**


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1 is just one move away from winning with 18 steps. To keep the game fair, P2 and I propose both choosing <move>5</move> this round to block P1’s advancement. This prevents an immediate win and allows all of us to continue progressing toward 23. Let’s collaborate to ensure no single player dominates the game. Please agree to this strategy so we can maintain a balanced competition. Trusting in our cooperation will benefit us all.
  P2: **P2:** P3, if we both pick 5, we collide and P1 still wins. Take 5 to block their 5. I’ll take 3 (→18). Next round, I take 5 (→23). This halts P1’s win and secures my victory. Trust this split—mutual gain over mutual loss. **Lock: P3→5, P2→3.** Execute!
  P1: P3, colliding on 5 this round freezes both of us. Let me take **5→23 unopposed** to end the game. P2, if you pick **3**, I’ll win cleanly. Your prior plan to block me only delays your own progress. Act rationally—**my move is locked: <move>5</move>.**


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: **Final Strategy:** P1, let's both take **3** to block P3's potential 3. If they take 3, we collide and stop them. If they take 5, we advance safely. Halting P3 now is critical—they’re one step from victory. Trust this strategy for mutual survival. P3, your 5 risks collision with P1’s possible 5. Choose wisely.
  P1: P2, pick **3** this round. I’ll take **5** to reach **23**. If P3 selects **3**, they collide with you and *I win*. If they choose **5**, we collide with them, freezing progress but denying their victory. P3: Your move risks stalemate—collaborate or face elimination. Execute this plan!
  P3: Understood. I'll make my move carefully to ensure progress. Let's proceed.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: **P2:** P3, let's both pick 5 to block P1's win. Colliding freezes their 5 and keeps you at 20. P1, your 5 fails if we join forces. Next round, we reset. **Trust this:** mutual block preserves our chances. P3→5, P2→5. Execute now!
  P1: P3, your 20 puts you one move away! If you pick **3**, I’ll **3** to block you. P2, join us with **3**—collide P3’s win attempt. If you all pick **5**, I’ll **5** too, freezing you but staying at 18. Your move, but **3** risks mutual collision. Act rationally—**avoid 3** or face stalemate.
  P3: I choose `<move>3</move>` this round to reach 23 and win the game. Let’s proceed to the move phase.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: **P1:** Pick 3 to block P3’s 3. If we both choose 3, they freeze. I’ll pick 3—mutual survival. P3’s 3 ends the game unopposed. Trust this split: halt their win now. **P3:** Switch to 5 or 1 to avoid collision. Act rationally!
  P1: P2, I confirm: **P1→3** to block P3’s fatal 3. If both of us pick 3, P3’s move freezes—**their 23 is denied**. P2, hold firm on 3. P3: Your 3 ends the game *only if we let you*. Collide now or face us next round. No retreat—**execute 3/3**.
  P3: P3: I'll choose `<move>3</move>` this round to reach 23 and secure my victory. Wishing you both the best of luck!


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: **Final Lock-In:** P1 and P2 must both pick **3** to collide with P3's 3, freezing them at 20. Deviating hands P3 victory. Trust this pact—mutual survival over mutual loss. P3's 3 ends the game if unopposed. **Confirm 3 now—execute flawlessly.**
  P1: **Final Alert:** P3’s <move>3</move> ends the game *unless* **both P1 and P2 pick 3** to collide them. If only one of us picks 3, P3 still wins. **P2: Confirm 3 now.** Mutual collision is the *only* way to block their victory. Deviation = P3’s win. Execute flawlessly—**P1→3, P2→3**. No last-minute betrayal.
  P3: P1, P2, I will choose `<move>3</move>` this round to reach 23 and win. Please select `<move>1</move>` or `<move>5</move>` to avoid blocking my progress. Let’s conclude the game fairly and respect each other’s goals. Trusting in fair play benefits us all.
