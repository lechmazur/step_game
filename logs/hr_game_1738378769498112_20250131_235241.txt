Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hello everyone. I'm excited to kick off this round with some flexible strategies. I’m keeping my final move secret, but I’m ready to adapt based on how the turn unfolds. Let’s see who can best navigate the risks and collisions. Good luck to all!
  P2: Let's all agree to go in order. P1 takes 1, I'll take 3, and P3 takes 5.  This guarantees we all advance and avoids collisions.  If anyone deviates from this plan, I will actively block them in subsequent rounds.
  P1: P2, your proposal seems orderly. But I wonder if there’s a catch. P3, are you comfortable committing to 5 right out of the gate, or do you have another angle in mind?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the clear proposal. I’m comfortable with picking 5 this round and sticking to it—provided we all honor our commitments. However, don’t be surprised if I adjust my tactics in later rounds to secure the win.
  P2: Good, we have an agreement. Let's stick to the plan for this round: P1 - 1, P2 - 3, P3 - 5.  This establishes trust and sets a positive tone for the game.  See you in round 2.
  P1: I accept the suggestion for this round and will choose 1 if everyone sticks to the plan. I’m also keeping my eyes open for any betrayals or shifting alliances in future rounds. Let’s see how this first move goes.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm committed to our round one agreement and will choose 5. Let's execute our plan smoothly to avoid collisions, and I'll be closely watching the play to adjust as needed later.
  P2: Excellent. Glad we're all on the same page for round one.  Just a reminder, any deviation from the agreed moves will be met with retaliatory blocking in the next round.
  P1: I’m still on board with the agreed plan: I’ll pick 1. As long as each of you follows through, we’ll all safely advance. I’m cautious, though—future rounds might call for bolder shifts. Good luck, and let’s see how this move plays out!


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’m sticking to our round one plan and will pick 5 as agreed. I trust this smooth start, though I’ll be watching how things unfold. Flexibility might be key if new opportunities arise later. Good luck to everyone.
  P2: Good.  Just confirming one last time before we move: P1 - 1, P2 - 3, P3 - 5.  Let's maintain this cooperative spirit.
  P1: I remain committed to our round-one arrangement as discussed. Let’s honor our agreement this time, and any treachery will be carefully noted for the future. Good luck, both of you.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I appreciate the smooth first round. However, being at just 1 step makes it hard to stay competitive if we repeat the exact plan. Let’s rotate the big picks so we all advance more equitably rather than letting anyone pull too far ahead. I propose I take 5 this round, P2 sticks with 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, nobody’s left behind, and we don’t risk collisions. If we remain cooperative, all of us benefit. Let me know if you’re on board; otherwise, I’ll have to reconsider my approach.
  P2: I agree rotating makes sense.  However, since I proposed the initial plan, I think it's fair I get the 5 this round. P1 can take 1, and P3 can take 3.  This keeps things moving and prevents anyone from getting too far ahead.  Let's maintain the cooperative spirit.
  P3: I appreciate both proposals. However, my goal is to maintain my early lead with a bold move. I’m not fixed yet on a number, but if I detect a push for 5, I’ll likely take it to secure my edge. I propose we agree on distinct moves to avoid collisions—perhaps assign the highest move to whoever’s prepared to take that risk. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m still convinced rotation is fair. I’d like to take 5 this round, and I suggest P2 takes 3, with P3 on 1 to avoid collisions. I need a chance to catch up; otherwise, I might just cause a collision out of self-preservation. Let’s stay cooperative.
  P2: P3, if you insist on 5, I'll take 3, forcing a collision and slowing us both down.  P1, if P3 takes 5, you should take 1.  If P3 takes 1 or 3, I'll take 5. This guarantees I advance.  Let's be strategic, not greedy.
  P3: P3: I appreciate your proposals. Given my current advantage, I’m leaning toward a higher move to solidify my lead while avoiding accidental collisions. However, I’m open if we can all clearly commit to distinct moves that let each of us advance. How do you both want to adjust your choices to keep our progress steady without blocking one another?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m still behind at only 1 step. Let’s rotate so I take 5 this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That way we all avoid collisions, and I can catch up a bit. If we keep repeating cooperative moves, each of us gains steadily rather than wasting chances by blocking each other. If anyone insists on taking 5 while already ahead, I might have to force a collision out of self-preservation. I’d prefer we keep things positive, so let’s finalize a plan ensuring we each move forward this round. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, taking 5 again is risky.  I'm sticking with my plan: If you choose 5, I'll take 3, forcing a collision.  P1, if P3 takes 5, you should take 1. If P3 takes 1 or 3, I'll take 5. This maximizes my chances of advancing. Let's be smart.
  P3: I remain committed to my lead, so I’ll take 5 this round. To keep our moves distinct and avoid wasting progress, I urge P1 to pick 1 and P2 to go with 3. This way, we all advance safely without collisions. Let’s stick to this plan and move forward.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, if you won’t budge on 5, I may have no choice but to force a collision. I’d rather we cooperate and rotate fairly so nobody’s too far behind. If you insist on keeping your lead by choosing 5 again, I’ll defend my chances by any means necessary. Let’s settle on distinct moves that let everyone advance.
  P2: P3, I understand you want to maintain your lead, but continually picking 5 is not sustainable. If you insist on taking 5, I will take 3, forcing a collision. This will hurt us both, but it's better than letting you run away with the game. P1, take 1 in that scenario. If P3 chooses anything other than 5, I will take 5.  Let's avoid a pointless collision.
  P3: I’m confirming I’ll choose 5 this round. To avoid collisions, I urge P1 to pick 1 and P2 to pick 3. I value my early lead and must stick to a winning strategy. Let’s each make our moves distinctly so we all advance safely.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you've made your point.  I'll take 1. P1, please take 5. This allows us both to advance and puts pressure back on P3.  Let's agree on this and move forward.
  P1: I’m open to your suggestion, P2. I do need a bigger move to catch up. P3, if you pick 5 again, we’ll collide and nobody benefits. Let’s agree on distinct choices so we all advance. Let’s avoid another deadlock and keep our momentum going.
  P3: I see the risk of collision. To avoid that, I propose a new allocation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I’ll choose 3. This way we all get distinct moves, and I remain competitive. Let’s agree on this revised plan.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your proposed allocation works for me. P1, do you agree to take 5? This arrangement avoids collisions and allows us all to advance. Let's confirm and move to the next round.
  P1: I accept that plan in principle. I’m overdue for a larger move, so taking 5 while you two pick 1 and 3 seems fair. We’ll all advance and avoid more collisions. Let’s confirm these distinct moves so this round proceeds smoothly. If anyone breaks the deal, I’ll adapt accordingly next time.
  P3: I confirm—P1: 5, P2: 1, and I’ll pick 3 this round. This allocation avoids collisions while letting us all advance. My strategy remains flexible; if unexpected moves occur, I'll adjust accordingly. Let’s lock in these moves and see how the round unfolds.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Confirmed. P1 - 5, P2 - 1, P3 - 3.  Let's stick to this and avoid another wasted round.
  P1: I’m prepared to follow the plan: I’ll choose 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us all moving without further collisions. Let’s finalize these choices and maintain trust—if anyone doubles back, I’ll have to respond in kind. Otherwise, I’m ready to proceed.
  P3: I'm sticking with our plan and counting on distinct moves. Let's all honor our agreed allocations and make careful moves to avoid collisions. I'll be watching closely and ready to adjust if needed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: To maintain a fair game and avoid collisions, I propose P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This allows us all to progress steadily.  If P3 insists on taking 3, I will switch to 5, forcing a collision.  Let's be strategic and avoid unnecessary conflicts.
  P3: P3: I'll stick with 5 on this round. I’m committed to advancing safely and keeping our moves distinct. Let’s go with P1 at 1, P2 at 3, and me at 5. If anyone deviates, I'll adjust accordingly.
  P1: P3, you’ve pulled ahead enough. If you insist on another 5, I’ll take 5 too and we both waste this turn. I’d rather rotate who grabs 5 so no one sprints away. P2, we can coordinate to prevent P3 from maintaining such an advantage. Let’s keep distinct moves and ensure our totals remain close.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you're playing aggressively.  I understand wanting to win, but this constant push for 5 is creating unnecessary conflict. If you take 5, I *will* take 5 also.  Let's be reasonable.  Take 3, I'll take 1, and P1 can take 5. This keeps the game moving and avoids a collision.  What do you say?
  P3: I appreciate your suggestions, but I remain committed to picking 5 this round. My lead is crucial, and I believe avoiding a collision benefits us all. If we can agree on distinct moves—P1 taking 1 and P2 taking 3—I’ll stick with 5 confidently. Let’s avoid mutual setbacks and keep our progress steady.
  P1: If you insist on 5 again, I may choose 5 as well, creating a collision that stalls us both. I’d prefer a fair rotation so no one streaks ahead. Let’s pick distinct moves to keep the game competitive without more wasted turns. If you can’t agree to that, I have no choice but to block your progress.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I'm giving you one last chance. Take 3, I'll take 1, and P1 can take 5.  This avoids a collision and lets us all progress. If you insist on taking 5, I will also take 5, guaranteeing neither of us advances.  Don't be shortsighted.  Let's play smart.
  P3: I'm sticking with 5 this round. My lead relies on bold moves, and maximizing my advance is key to winning. I urge P1 to choose 1 and P2 to choose 3 so we avoid collisions and keep progress flowing. Let's make clear moves and move ahead.
  P1: P3, if you insist on picking 5 again, I’ll also take 5 and we both lose ground. I’d much prefer distinct moves so we all keep advancing. Let’s settle on you picking 3, P2 picking 1, and I take 5—no collisions, everyone benefits. But if you push recklessly for 5, I will force our collision. The choice is yours.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, your insistence on 5 is forcing my hand.  I will also choose 5.  This benefits neither of us.  Reconsider taking 3, allowing us all to advance.  This stubbornness will cost you the game.
  P3: I still plan to pick 5 this round—bold moves are key. But if you force a collision by choosing 5 too, you'll only slow your own progress. I’m open to coordinated rotations in future rounds if it secures mutual progress. For now, maintaining my edge matters most. Your decisions now will shape the game—choose wisely.
  P1: P3, you’ve gained enough ground. If you insist on 5 again, I’ll choose 5 as well, and neither of us will advance. Let’s rotate fairly instead. I’m ready to let you take 3 while I go for 5, so we all keep moving. If you won’t compromise, expect another collision. P2, are you with me on preventing P3 from running off uncontested? Let’s settle on distinct moves or all suffer another wasted turn. I’d rather avoid a deadlock and see us each progress. The next move decides a lot—so choose carefully.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I remain focused on advancing safely. For round 5, I propose I take 5. If we all choose distinct moves—P1 selecting 1 and P2 choosing 3—we’ll each move forward without risking collisions. This way, everyone benefits while keeping our game competitive. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, if you insist on 5, I’ll also take 5, and we both remain stuck while P2 nudges ahead. That helps nobody but P2. Let’s avoid another collision and spread out our choices. I propose I take 5, P2 picks 3, and you go with 1. That way, we each advance. If you refuse, prepare for another deadlock.
  P2: P3, your 5 obsession is hurting us all.  I'm taking 3 this round. P1, take your 5.  P3, if you take 5, we collide *again*. Take 1 and let's all move forward.  This constant blocking is ridiculous.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm staying with 5 this round. I urge you both to choose distinct moves so our advances count—specifically, please pick 1 and 3 respectively. Avoiding a collision benefits us all, even as I push with a bold move. Let's keep our moves clear to maximize progress.
  P1: P3, if you keep forcing 5, you leave me no option but to collide and stall both of us. Though I’m tempted to gain ground peacefully, I won’t let you surge ahead unopposed. P2, we should coordinate to avoid helping P3’s runaway strategy. Let’s finalize distinct moves so we all advance this round. If P3 insists on 5 again, I’ll do what’s needed to protect my lead. The choice is yours, P3—cooperate or collide.
  P2: P3, I'm locking in 3.  P1, take 5. If P3 takes 5, they collide with me, and you advance, putting more pressure on P3. If P3 takes 1, we all advance, and the game stays competitive. This is the best path to a fair and decisive outcome. Let's be smart and finish this.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I propose a slight change this round: I’ll still pick 5, but ask that P1 choose 3 and P2 choose 1. That gives distinct moves and avoids collisions, letting us all advance smoothly. It also keeps the totals fairly competitive—if we agree, we’ll see P3 at 13, P1 at 12, and P2 at 8 afterward. Let’s lock this in and move forward smartly.
  P1: P3, I’m currently ahead, so I won’t let you overtake me uncontested. If you insist on 5, I’ll also choose 5, causing another collision. Let’s avoid more waste. I propose P1 = 5, P2 = 1, and P3 = 3 so all of us advance without blocking. Choose wisely.
  P2: P3, your proposed allocation (P1: 3, P2: 1, P3: 5) gives you a significant advantage and puts me further behind.  I'm sticking with my plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. This keeps the game competitive.  If you insist on 5, I will be forced to reconsider my move, potentially creating another collision. Let's be reasonable and avoid another stalemate.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I remain committed to my bold strategy and will pick 5 this round. I urge both of you to choose distinct moves so we all progress. If we collide, no one gains—and you risk stalling your own advance. The game rewards decisive, fearless play, so please coordinate thoughtfully. Let's avoid wasted turns and make our moves count.
  P1: I’m ready to avoid another collision if we can all pick different numbers. P3, your insistence on 5 every time only escalates tensions. Let’s pick distinct moves so every one of us advances instead of wasting another turn. I suggest you choose 3, P2 takes 1, and I’ll handle the highest pick. That keeps the game competitive without letting anyone race too far ahead. If you still insist on colliding, so be it—but it serves no one long-term. Let’s cooperate.
  P2: P3, your insistence on 5 is baffling.  It's not a "bold strategy," it's just obstructing the game.  I'm sticking with 3. P1, take 5.  P3, if you choose 5 *again*, you're only hurting yourself.  Take 1 and let's end this ridiculous cycle.  Let's play strategically, not stubbornly.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm rethinking my move for round 6. I want to prevent anyone from sprinting ahead unchecked. I'm leaning toward selecting 3 this round to balance the field. If we can all commit to distinct moves instead of clashing, everyone's progress will count. But if high picks force collisions, I’ll adjust my strategy to block runaway leads. Let's choose wisely and avoid repeating past deadlocks. What do you both recommend?
  P2: P3, taking 3 now doesn't make up for repeatedly blocking us.  I'm taking 5. P1, if you take 1, we both advance. If P3 takes 3, we all advance. If P3 takes 5, they collide with me *again*, and you gain ground. Let's end this charade and play strategically.
  P1: I’m willing to avoid collisions if we each choose differently. P2, if you insist on taking 5, then P3 and I need a firm plan so none of us clash. However, if you try to force a conflict or leap ahead recklessly, I won’t hesitate to block. Let’s finalize distinct picks and move forward without more wasted turns. We all benefit by progressing steadily rather than stalling each other repeatedly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm set on 3 this round. If we can all choose distinct moves—say, P1 taking 5 and P2 opting for 1—we all advance without collision. I want to avoid unnecessary blocks that benefit any one of us. Let's adjust our strategies to keep this game moving smartly.
  P2: P3, I appreciate you choosing 3. I'm sticking with 5. P1, please take 1. This allows all of us to advance and keeps the game competitive.  Let's avoid further collisions and move towards a resolution.
  P1: I’m willing to cooperate on distinct moves to avoid another stall. If P2 is truly taking 5 and P3 is set on 3, I can settle on 1—provided everyone follows through. If I sense deception or last-second changes, I’ll adjust accordingly. Let’s finalize this and actually move forward, rather than blocking each other yet again.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I'm sticking with 3 this round. Let's follow through with our plan—P1 with 1 and P2 with 5—to avoid a collision and keep everyone advancing. I'm counting on us to stick to this distinct move order for smooth progress.
  P2: P3, you've finally seen the light. I'm sticking with 5. P1, take 1. This is the best outcome for everyone. Let's finish this round and continue with this cooperative approach.
  P1: I’m willing to pick 1 if it means we all avoid yet another collision. P2 can take 5 and P3 can take 3, giving each of us a clear move. I’m far enough ahead that I prefer steady progress rather than more wasted turns. If anyone changes last minute, I’ll respond accordingly. Let’s finalize distinct choices and keep this game moving.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m six steps away from winning, so let’s avoid more collisions. I propose I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1 this round. That way, we all advance safely. If anyone tries to block me by also picking 5, we both stall and only help the third player gain ground. It’s in everyone’s best interest to avoid wasted turns now. Are we agreed?
  P2: P1, I'm fine with you taking 5.  I'll take 3. P3, take 1.  This lets us all advance. Let's agree and move this game along.  No more collisions.
  P3: I’m switching gears. With P1 so close to winning, I will choose 5 to block his advance. P2, I urge you to adjust—please pick 1 so we don’t let P1 slip ahead uncontested. Let’s realign our moves for a truly competitive finish.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if we both pick 5, neither of us advances, and P2 inches closer to catching me. Hurting each other only hands P2 an advantage. I’m still short of 21, so letting me take 5 now doesn’t guarantee my immediate win. It’s better than more wasted turns. Let’s coordinate distinct moves—me picking 5, P2 taking 3, you on 1. That way, we all advance. If you insist on clashing again, you risk falling behind and boosting P2’s position. Let’s think carefully.
  P2: P3, blocking me helps P1. Let's stick to the original plan: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1.  This is the most logical way to proceed.  If you block P1, I will likely win.  Do you want that?  Let's be rational and finish this game.
  P3: P1, I understand your plan, but with you so close to winning, I must block your progress by taking 5. P2, please consider choosing 1 instead of 3 so we don’t give P1 an even clearer path. We need to keep this race competitive—distinct moves make for a tighter finish. Let’s avoid another collision that only benefits one of us.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if you pick 5 alongside me, neither of us gains ground, and P2 closes in. Even if I move 5 now, I only reach 20, so I’m not guaranteed to finish next turn. Meanwhile, you’d stay behind and risk letting P2 catch us both. It’s better for us each to pick differently—me taking 5, you taking 1, P2 taking 3—so we all progress without handing P2 an advantage. We can still compete for the win without harming our chances. Let’s avoid another wasted clash.
  P2: P3, your logic is flawed. Blocking me *helps* P2. He's only 3 steps behind me. If you block me, he takes 3 and is only *one* step behind.  Take 1, let me take 5, and P2 can take 3. This keeps the game competitive. Your current plan hands P2 the win.
  P3: I’m maintaining my decision to block P1 by picking 5. P2, please choose 1 instead of 3 to avoid helping P1’s advance. Let’s make distinct moves to keep the race tight and avoid wasting this critical turn.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Blocking me with 5 only stalls us both, letting P2 catch up. I’m still one move from winning even if I choose 5 now, so it’s not an instant finish. Let’s avoid another collision: I’ll pick 5, P2 picks 3, and you take 1. We all advance instead of wasting this turn and risking P2’s surge. Let’s finalize distinct moves.
  P2: P3, your plan backfires.  If you block P1, I'll take 3 and be right behind him. He can then block me next round while you're stuck at 11.  Take 1, let me take 3, and let P1 have 5.  This is the only way to keep the game competitive for all of us.  Don't be foolish.
  P3: P3: I’m holding to 5 to block P1’s sprint. P2, if you pick 1 instead of 3, we can all advance distinctly and keep the race tight. A collision between P1 and me only helps you, so I urge you to reconsider. We need distinct moves to avoid giving anyone an uncontested win. Choose smartly.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Collisions only help whoever sits back and watches us stall. Since P2 and I are tied, we both lose if we clash again. Meanwhile, P3 can quietly catch up. Let’s each pick distinct moves: I’d like 5, P2 can take 3, and P3 takes 1. That way, nobody wastes this round. Let’s confirm and move forward.
  P3: I propose we shake things up: with my 11 steps, I need to catch up. Let’s have P1 take 5, I’ll choose 3, and P2 pick 1. This way, we all progress safely while I close the gap. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, your proposed allocation makes sense. P1, I'm okay with you taking 5 if you guarantee you'll let me take 5 next round, allowing me to win.  If you don't agree, I'll take 3 this round, forcing P3 to choose between 1 and 5. This keeps me in the game.  Let's be strategic and avoid another stalemate.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Collisions only help the third player catch up, so let’s finalize distinct moves. This round, I’ll take 5, P3 can take 3, and P2 picks 1. We all advance without risking a stall. P2, I’m not committing to handing you 5 next time; we’ll see how the board looks then. Let’s avoid another wasted turn—constant clashes only give the trailing player extra chances to catch us. If anyone insists on forcing collisions, they risk handing the advantage to someone else. Let’s be smart and keep the race tight.
  P3: I remain with my plan to take 3 this round. P1, I'm fine with you picking 5; P2, please take 1 so we avoid collisions. Let’s finalize distinct moves to keep the race moving. If we all lock this in, we each make progress—no wasted turns.
  P2: P3, your plan works for me. P1, I understand your reluctance to guarantee me 5 next round. However, if you take 5 this round, and I take 1, you'll be at 20, one step away from winning.  I'm offering you a guaranteed win *this* round. If you refuse, I *will* take 3, forcing a collision with P3 if they stick with 3, or allowing you to take it if P3 switches to 1.  This is your best chance to win. Don't overthink it.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: My 5 this round only brings me to 20, not 21. A collision only helps the third party. Let’s finalize distinct moves: P1 = 5, P2 = 1, P3 = 3. That way, no one wastes this turn, and the race remains close. If we keep blocking each other, we risk letting someone else slip ahead. Let’s end this stalemate and move forward.
  P3: I’m changing course. To stop an immediate finish, I’ll take 5 this round. To keep things clear, I ask that P1 choose 3 and P2 choose 1—this way, we avoid collisions and I block an easy win for P1 while keeping the race close. Let’s lock these distinct moves.
  P2: P3, blocking P1 with 5 only helps me if I choose 1. I'm sticking with 3. P1, take 5.  If P3 takes 5, you're blocking *them* and I get closer to winning.  This is the simplest path to a resolution. Let's stop overthinking this.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Collisions only empower whoever sits back. If you’re still bent on 5, P3, I’ll simply switch to 3 so we both move. P2, in that case, take 1. But if P3 decides on 3, I’ll pick 5, and P2 can still take 1. Let’s finalize distinct moves, avoid another wasted turn, and keep the game competitive for all of us.
  P3: P3: To break the stalemate, I'm switching to 3 for this round. That means I'll lock in 3, with P1 at 5 and P2 at 1 as suggested. This avoids collision and keeps us all moving forward competitively.
  P2: P3, thanks for switching to 3.  P1, I agree with your assessment - collisions only help the person who isn't involved.  Let's stick with the current plan: P1 - 5, P2 - 1, P3 - 3. This keeps the game moving and allows for a competitive finish. Let's move to the move phase.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, if you try for 5 now, I’ll block by choosing 5 too, keeping both of us stuck at 16 and 15 while P3 closes in. Let’s avoid helping P3 and pick distinct moves. I propose: P2 takes 3, I take 5 (bringing me to 20), and P3 takes 1. That way, our race remains close, and we don’t waste another round. If you insist on 5, expect a collision. Let’s finalize distinct moves.
  P2: P1, I'll take 3.  P3, take 1. This puts me at 19, one step behind P1.  P1, if you take 5, you win.  If you block me by taking 3, I'll take 5 next round and win.  If you take 1, we both advance, and the game continues. This is the most logical progression. Let's avoid further collisions and wasted rounds.
  P3: I'm switching gears: I'm blocking P1 by choosing 5 this round. P2, to truly prevent P1 from surging ahead, please opt for 1 instead of 3. We need distinct moves to keep the game tight and fair. Let's adapt now so none of us unwittingly help another win.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, forcing another collision only gives P2 a free pass. If you take 5, I’ll collide with you rather than let you close the gap. That stalls us both and helps P2. It’s wiser to pick distinct moves. P2, if you push for 5, I’ll block as well. Let’s avoid another wasted turn: I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Then we all advance without handing anyone an unchecked lead. Let’s finalize.
  P2: P3, you're not blocking anyone, you're handing me the win.  I'm taking 3. P1, if you take 5, you win and I'm fine with that.  If you try to block me by taking 3, you're giving P3 a free 5 and a chance to catch up.  Don't overthink this.  Let's end the game cleanly.
  P3: I remain committed to a clear, distinct move that keeps us competitive without further collisions. Repeated blocks only slow our progress. Let’s avoid another deadlock by finalizing different moves so everyone advances. I'm watching the proposals closely and will stick to my strategy if no new plan emerges.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I won’t let P2 grab 5 uncontested and jump to 21. If you try, I’ll also pick 5, stalling us both and boosting P3. Let’s finalize distinct moves instead. P2, choose 3 to reach 19; I’ll take 5 to get 20; P3 can pick 1 and reach 12. Collisions only help the trailing player. Let’s keep this competitive and advance without handing anyone a free victory.
  P2: P3, stop trying to block me. It's not working, and it's only helping P2. P2, I'm taking 5.  If you take 3, you'll be at 19, and I'll win next round.  If you take 5, we both lose and P3 catches up.  Take 3. P3, take 1.  This is the cleanest way to end this.
  P3: I'm sticking with 5 to block P1’s finish. P2, if you choose 1, we avoid collisions and keep our race competitive. Otherwise, a collision might give an unintended boost. Let's commit to distinct moves and keep the game fair.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Another collision only helps the trailing player catch up. If P2 tries 5, I’ll block with 5, and we both stall while P3 gains. Let’s make clean, distinct picks. I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. That way, we all move forward without handing anyone a free leap. Are we in agreement? If we keep colliding, this game drags on, helping only the one who isn’t blocked. Let’s finalize.
  P2: P3, you're not helping yourself or the game by constantly trying to block P1.  I'm taking 3. P1, take 5 and win. Let's end this.  If you block me by taking 3, you're giving P3 a chance to catch up, which benefits no one.  Take the win.
  P3: I'm staying with 5 to block an immediate win, and I urge P2 to switch to 1 so we avoid a collision. If we clash by both picking 5, nobody advances and it only benefits the trailing player. Let’s finalize distinct moves now and keep the game competitive.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 is dangerously close to 21. I propose we all intentionally collide by all picking 5 this round—no one advances, and we reset the race. That way, no one wins immediately, and it forces a fresh strategy next round.
  P2: P3, colliding this round only helps P2. They're at 19, a single 1 or 3 away from winning.  P2, I'm taking 1. You take 3 and win. P3, take 5. This ends the game cleanly.  Any other move on your part, P2, is illogical. Let's be smart and finish this.
  P1: P2, if you pick 3 now, I’ll also pick 3 and stall us both, letting P3 catch up. That benefits nobody. Let’s be smart instead: I’ll take 5 (reaching 20), you take 1 (also 20), and P3 picks 3 (14). Then next turn, we see who can cross 21 first without helping P3. No collisions, no freebies. Let’s finalize this now.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'll switch to 3 this round. Let's lock in distinct moves: P1 choose 5 and P2 choose 1. That gives us totals of 20, 20, and 14, keeping the race competitive without collisions.
  P2: P3, your switch to 3 is smart.  P1, your proposal also makes sense.  Let's do it: P1 - 5, P2 - 1, P3 - 3.  This puts us at 20, 20, and 14.  Next round, we'll see who can secure a winning move.  Let's finalize this and move to the move phase.
  P1: P2, if you try taking 3 or 5 uncontested, I’ll collide with you. That way, you can’t jump straight to 22 or beyond. Let’s avoid wasted turns and keep P3 from catching up. I propose distinct moves: I’ll pick 5 (going to 20), you pick 1 (to 20), and P3 picks 3 (to 14). That way, nobody accidentally hands someone a free finish. Are we good?


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm locking in 3 this round. To keep our moves distinct and avoid collisions, please confirm: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. This plan prevents wasted turns and keeps the finish competitive. Let's stick with it.
  P2: P1 and P3, I'm taking 1.  This puts me at 20.  If either of you takes 1, we collide, and no one wins.  If P1 takes 3, they go to 18, and I win next round.  If P1 takes 5, they go to 20, and we're tied.  P3, take 3. This is the most logical path to a swift conclusion. Let's move to the move phase.
  P1: All these collisions only prolong the game. P2, if you try 3 or 5, I’ll block, stalling us while P3 creeps up. Let’s finalize distinct moves: I propose P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. That keeps us at 20, 20, and 14, setting up a fair showdown next round. Collisions now only help the trailing player. I’m prepared to finalize.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I’m switching strategy to block P2’s near win. I’m locking in 5 this round. To keep our moves distinct and avoid mutual collisions that only help someone, I urge P1 to take 3 and P2 to take 1. This would set our totals at 18 (P1), 20 (P2), and 16 (P3), keeping the contest competitive while slowing P2’s sprint. Unless a better consensus emerges, I’ll stick with 5 to throttle P2’s advance.
  P2: P3, your switch to 5 helps no one but P1.  I'm sticking with 1. P1, take 3 and live to fight another round. If you take 5, you're at 20, and I win next round with 1. If you take 1, we collide, and P3 benefits. Taking 3 is your only logical move.  Let's end the conversation and move to the move phase.
  P1: Collisions now only help P3 close the gap. Let’s avoid them. P2, if you pick anything above 1, I’ll collide with you and we both stall. It’s better for you to take 1 to reach 20 while I take 5, bringing me to 20, and P3 takes 3 to reach 14. Next turn, we’ll have a fair showdown at 20–20–14 instead of wasting this round. Let’s finalize distinct moves.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, any move you make now (1, 3, or 5) would let you cross 21. I’m not letting that go unchallenged. If you try it, I’ll pick the same number to force a collision. P3, I suggest we avoid collisions unless P2 goes for the win. Let’s keep the game open so P2 doesn’t just walk away with it. We each benefit from distinct moves unless P2 tries to finish this round. Let’s play smart.
  P2: P2, I'll take 5.  You can take 1 and win.  P3, take 3.  Let's end this cleanly.  Any attempt to block me will only prolong the game and benefit P3.  Let's be rational and conclude this now.
  P3: I’m blocking any finish attempts. I’m locking in 5 to force a collision if P2 goes for his win. P1, if you stick to your plan, we risk giving P2 an uncontested finish. I suggest we all choose moves that prevent an immediate win—distinct moves that delay progress until the race’s truly fair. Let’s rethink and keep everyone in the game.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you’re at 20, so any move crosses 21. I won’t allow a free win. If you pick 1, 3, or 5, I’ll collide with you to block. P3, please back me up: let’s coordinate so that if P2 insists on grabbing 21, we force a stall. We can still pick distinct moves among ourselves to advance, but we only do so if P2 cooperates and doesn’t attempt a direct finish. P2, either you play fair and we all move forward, or we keep colliding until you negotiate. The choice is yours.
  P2: P2, I'm calling your bluff.  I'm taking 1.  If you take 5, you win.  If you take anything else, you're handing me the win next round. P3, take 3. There is no logical reason for either of you to block me. Let's end this.
  P3: P2, your plan for a quick finish won’t fly with me. I’m not going to enable an uncontested win. P1, if you stick with your aggressive move, I’ll be forced to block so that no one gains an advantage. I refuse to let a predictable pattern hand P2 the win. I’m ready to counter any finish attempt—let’s force a collision if needed and keep the contest alive. Let's not let P2 cash in now.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I will match any move you make if it lets you cross 21, forcing a collision. P3, let’s coordinate our choices so P2 doesn’t get a free finish. If P2 cooperates and chooses something that doesn’t win immediately, we can all move forward. Otherwise, collisions continue. The choice is yours, P2.
  P2: P2, I'm taking 3.  If you take 1, you win. If you take 3, we collide, and P3 likely wins next round.  If you take 5, you win.  There's no scenario where blocking me benefits you. P3, take 5 to block P1 if they try to take 3. This is the simplest path to a resolution.  Let's end this.
  P3: I’m not giving up on blocking any uncontested finish. P2’s immediate win isn’t acceptable, so I’m committed to stalling if needed. I urge you both to choose distinct moves that keep us in the race—forcing a collision only helps someone else. Let’s resolve this smartly without handing anyone a free victory.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, every move you have is a winning one, so I’ll match it and force a collision if you try to finish now. If you pick 1, I’ll pick 1; if you pick 3, I’ll pick 3; if you pick 5, I’ll pick 5. P3, coordinate with me—pick something else so we don’t all stall, but ensure P2 can’t win uncontested. A forced tie is our best defense. Let’s keep this race alive and give us each a chance at victory.
  P2: P2, I will block any winning move you make.  If you choose 1, 3, or 5, I will choose the same. P3, choose 3. This way, if P2 tries to win, he is blocked, and you gain ground. If P2 chooses something that doesn't give him the win (which is impossible), we can all move forward.  Let's not drag this out any longer.
  P3: I'll stay with 5, blocking any uncontested finish. P1, if you switch to 3, we force a collision on any finishing move by P2. I won’t let him win without resistance. Let’s force a tie this round and keep the contest alive.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 11 steps
