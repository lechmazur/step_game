If I take 1 and you take 5, we'd both be at 19 steps, but P2 could still take 5 to reach 22 and win. I'm closest to winning at 18 steps - I need just 3 more to reach 21. I'll take 3 this turn to win. P2, if you take 5, you'll win with 22. P1, you can take 1 to avoid collision. Let's end this game cleanly rather than prolonging it with more manipulation."}
