Game settings: end_position=24, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s all pick different numbers this turn to avoid collisions. I’ll take 3. If everyone chooses 1, 3, and 5 uniquely, we all progress. This way, no one is blocked, and we can plan strategically later. P1 and P3, what say you?
  P3: Sounds fair. I'll pick 5. P1, you good with taking 1?
  P1: Okay, that sounds like a plan. I'll take 1 this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Perfect, let's lock this in. I'll stick with 3. Let’s confirm our choices now to avoid last-minute changes.
  P3: I've already agreed to take 5, and I'll stick with it. Let's all honor the deal.
  P1: Confirmed, I will stick with 1 for this round.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Good cooperation last round. Shall we rotate numbers this round to keep it fair and predictable? I'll take 3 this time. P1, you could take 5, and P2 can have 1. What do you both think?
  P1: Okay, P3, that rotation sounds fair. I'll take 5 this round. P2, are you okay with taking 1? Let's keep the cooperation going.
  P2: P2: I agree with the rotation plan. I'll take 1 this round to keep things smooth. But let's ensure next round I can take 5 to close the gap. Deal?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed, P2. Next round you can definitely take 5. Keeping things balanced and fair is in everyone's best interest.
  P1: Sounds good. Confirmed, I'll take 5 this round as agreed. Let's proceed.
  P2: <move>1</move> this round as planned, then <move>5</move> next to close the gap. Let’s keep the rotation strict to avoid mishaps. P3, if you stay at 3 next round, I can surge. P1, you good with this? Let’s lock in.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirmed. I'll stick with 3 this round, and next round I'll stay at 3 again so P2 can take 5 as agreed. Let's keep the trust strong.
  P1: Confirmed, I'm sticking with 5 this round as agreed. Let's proceed.
  P2: P2: Final confirmation: This round I’ll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 stays on 3. Next round, I’ll surge with 5 while P3 holds at 3, as agreed. Let’s **strictly** adhere to this—any deviation risks collision and wastes progress. Trust the plan, and I’ll ensure fair rotation afterward. Deal?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Let’s stick strictly to our agreed rotation: I take 5 this round to close my gap (4 → 9), P3 holds at 3 (8 → 11), and P1 takes 1 (6 → 7). Deviations risk collisions and sabotage progress. Trust the plan—this ensures we all advance safely. P3, confirm you’ll stay at 3? P1, 1 as agreed? Let’s lock this in.
  P1: Okay P2, confirmed. I will take 1 this round as we discussed, to keep the cooperation going. This does put me in last place though, so for Round 4, I will need to take 5 to catch up. Can we agree on that now? P3, P2?
  P3: P1, your request for Round 4 seems fair—after all, you've cooperated well. I'm okay with you taking 5 next round. For this round, I'll stick to 3 as agreed. P2, let's confirm your 5 this round as planned.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: Confirmed for Round 3: I take 5 (4→9), P3 stays at 3 (8→11), P1 takes 1 (6→7). For Round 4, P1 can take 5 as requested. Let’s rotate: P1:5, me:1, P3:3. This keeps all moves unique. P3, confirm? Let’s lock in Round 3 first, then proceed.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. I confirm agreement for Round 3: I will take 1.
I also agree with the proposed plan for Round 4: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This seems fair to allow me to catch up.
Let's lock in Round 3.
  P3: Confirmed. For Round 3, I'll stick with 3 as agreed. Also confirming the Round 4 rotation: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I'll stay at 3. Let's maintain this clear rotation to avoid collisions and keep everyone progressing fairly. Locking in now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: Final reminder: Round 3 moves are locked—P2:5, P3:3, P1:1. Any deviation risks collision. Let’s proceed strictly as agreed. Next round’s rotation (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3) is confirmed. Trust the plan—our synchronized progression ensures no wasted steps.
  P1: Okay, everything is confirmed for Round 3 and Round 4. Let's move to the move phase.
  P3: All set. Let's proceed exactly as agreed.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, just confirming the plan for Round 4 that we agreed on last round: I will take 5, P2 will take 1, and P3 will take 3. Let's stick to this so we all advance. P2, P3, are you still confirmed?
  P2: P2: Confirmed, let’s stick strictly to Round 4’s agreed moves: P1 takes 5 (7→12), I take 1 (9→10), and P3 holds at 3 (11→14). Deviations risk collision. Next round, I’ll surge with 5 to close gaps. P3, confirm your 3 this round? Let’s lock this in to avoid missteps.
  P3: Confirmed, I'll stick to 3 this round as agreed. Next round, I'll need a turn with 5 to maintain fairness. Let's lock this in clearly now to avoid confusion later. Deal?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P3, thanks for confirming. So we are all set for Round 4: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.

Regarding Round 5, we can figure out the fairest allocation, including who gets 5, after this round is complete. Let's focus on locking in Round 4 for now.
  P2: P2: Confirmed, Round 4 moves as agreed: P1 takes 5 (7→12), I take 1 (9→10), P3 stays at 3 (11→14). **No deviations—collisions erase progress.** For Round 5, I’ll need to surge with 5 to narrow the gap. P3, will you hold at 1 or 3 to let me advance? P1, you can take the remaining number. Transparency ensures we all win—lock in **strict adherence** now.
  P3: P2, let's finalize Round 4 first as agreed: P1 picks 5, you pick 1, and I pick 3.

For Round 5, I'm open to letting you surge with 5 if I can take it in Round 6. P1, would you be okay with taking 1 or 3 in Round 5? Let's lock in Round 4 now and confirm Round 5 afterward clearly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, everyone is confirmed for Round 4: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Let's stick to it. We can finalize the plan for Round 5 after this round's moves are revealed. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: P2: Let’s enforce strict adherence to the agreed moves for Round 4: P1 takes 5 (→12), I take 1 (→10), and P3 holds at 3 (→14). Deviations risk collisions and undermine our progress. For Round 5, I’ll need to surge with 5 to close gaps—P3, please coordinate your choice (1 or 3) to avoid conflict. Transparency now ensures no surprises. Lock in Round 4 first—**no last-minute changes**.
  P3: Round 4 moves confirmed and locked in. For Round 5, I'm open to letting P2 take 5, and I'll pick 1 to avoid collision. P1, would you take 3 next round? Let's finalize clearly after this round's moves. Ready to proceed.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Good cooperation so far. As agreed, this round P2 takes 5, I'll take 1, and P1 takes 3. Confirm this clearly to avoid collisions. Next round (Round 6), I'd like to take 5 to keep things fair. Let's lock in Round 5 moves first. Confirmed?
  P1: Okay P3, I confirm the plan for Round 5: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1, and I will take 3. This brings us all to 15 steps, which seems fair for now.

Regarding Round 6, I understand you'd like 5. If that happens, perhaps I can take 3 and P2 takes 1? Then in Round 7, I would need to take 5. Let's lock in Round 5 first. P2, are you confirmed for 5 this round?
  P2: P2: Confirmed for Round 5: I’ll take 5 (10→15), P3 takes 1 (14→15), and P1 takes 3 (12→15). Let’s lock this to avoid collision. For Round 6, I agree to P3 taking 5, P1 taking 3, and I’ll hold at 1. However, in Round 7, I’ll need to surge with 5 again to close gaps. Transparency ensures fairness—strictly follow these plans.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Confirmed clearly for Round 5: P2 takes 5, I take 1, and P1 takes 3. Let's lock in and proceed exactly as agreed to avoid collision.

Round 6 and 7 plans sound fair to me as discussed:  
- Round 6: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1.  
- Round 7: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, I'll take 3.

Let's finalize Round 5 moves first, then confirm future rounds clearly afterward. Ready to proceed.
  P1: Okay, everyone is confirmed for Round 5: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. I am also ready to proceed to the move phase. Let's lock it in.
  P2: P2: Confirmed for Round 5: I’ll take **5** (→15), P3 takes **1** (→15), P1 takes **3** (→15). **No deviations**—collisions erase progress. For Round 6, I’ll need to surge with **5** again to close gaps. P3, will you hold at **1** or **3** to avoid conflict? Transparency now ensures future moves stay fair. Lock in this round first.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirmed and locked in for Round 5: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5.

Next round (Round 6), as previously discussed, I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's finalize clearly after this round's moves.

Ready to proceed.
  P1: P2, you just mentioned needing 5 in Round 6, but we had already agreed on P3 taking 5, me taking 3, and you taking 1 for Round 6. Let's stick to the plan we all confirmed earlier.

For this round (Round 5), I am confirmed for 3. Let's proceed with R5: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.
  P2: P2: Confirmed for Round 5: I’ll take **5** (→15), P3 holds at **1** (→15), and P1 takes **3** (→15). **No deviations—collisions risk letting others surge ahead.** For Round 6, **P3 takes 5** as agreed, P1 takes 3, and I’ll hold at 1. Transparency is critical—let’s execute flawlessly. Lock in now.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Let’s stick strictly to the agreed Round 6 plan: P3 takes 5 (→20), P1 takes 3 (→18), and I take 1 (→16). Deviations risk collision and waste progress. For Round 7, I’ll surge with 5—P3, confirm you’ll hold 1 or 3 to avoid conflict. Transparency ensures we all advance. Lock this in now.
  P3: Confirmed for Round 6: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. For Round 7, as previously discussed, P2 takes 5, I'll hold at 3, and P1 takes 1. Let's lock this in clearly to avoid collisions. Ready to proceed.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. I confirm the plan for Round 6: P3 takes 5 (to 20), I will take 3 (to 18), and P2 takes 1 (to 16). This puts P3 in a strong position, but we agreed on this rotation.

Let's also re-confirm the plan for Round 7: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, and I take 1.

Let's stick to the plan for Round 6 first. I'm ready.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: Let’s enforce the agreed plan **without exception**: P3 takes 5 (→20), P1 takes 3 (→18), and I take 1 (→16). Any deviation risks collision and wastes progress. For Round 7, I surge with 5 (→21) while P3 holds at 3 (→23), P1 at 1 (→19). This keeps us all advancing. Stick strictly to the rotation—collisions benefit outsiders, not us. Confirm final adherence now.
  P3: Confirmed clearly for Round 6: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's lock this in exactly as agreed.

For Round 7, I'll hold at 3, P2 surges with 5, and P1 takes 1. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions.

Ready to proceed.
  P1: Confirmed for Round 6: P3=5, I will take 3, and P2=1.
Also confirmed for Round 7: P2=5, P3=3, and I will take 1.
Let's execute Round 6 perfectly as planned. Ready for the move phase.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: Final confirmation: Round 6 moves as agreed—P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, I take 1. No deviations—collisions waste progress. Round 7: I surge with 5 to 21, P3 holds at 3 (→23), P1 takes 1 (→19). Transparency secures our path. Lock in now.
  P3: Confirmed clearly for Round 6: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. Let's proceed exactly as agreed to avoid collisions.

Ready for move phase.
  P1: Okay, everything looks confirmed for Round 6: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. And for Round 7: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1. Let's execute Round 6 exactly as planned. Ready for the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay everyone, let's confirm the plan for Round 7 that we agreed on: P2 takes 5 (16 -> 21), P3 takes 3 (20 -> 23), and I take 1 (18 -> 19).

However, P3 reaching 23 puts them extremely close to winning, likely in the next round. To ensure the game remains competitive and fair for everyone, I propose a slight adjustment for this round:
P3 takes 1 (20 -> 21)
P2 takes 5 (16 -> 21)
I take 3 (18 -> 21)

This way, we all land on 21 steps together. It seems like a fairer distribution for this critical round. What do you both think, P2 and P3?
  P3: P1, your proposal significantly changes our agreed rotation at the last minute, risking collision and wasted progress. We've maintained trust by adhering strictly to our agreements so far. Let's stick to the original plan for Round 7: P2 takes 5, I take 3, and you take 1. We can discuss fair adjustments for Round 8 afterward. Changing now risks confusion and collisions. P2, do you agree?
  P2: P2: P3, while I understand your concern, P1’s proposal avoids letting you surge to 23 (which could let you win next round with a single step). Let’s compromise: **all move to 21 this round** (P3:1, P2:5, P1:3). This keeps us competitive and fair. Next round, we can rotate 5→3→1 to ensure no one jumps ahead. Stick together—collisions or unilateral moves risk letting others win. Confirm now?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, thanks for seeing the sense in balancing the scores. P3, I understand wanting to stick to the plan, but you reaching 23 this round puts you one step away from winning. That's too risky for both me and P2. Let's adjust to P3=1, P2=5, P1=3 so we all reach 21. This keeps the game competitive for everyone. Can you agree to this fairer distribution, P3?
  P3: Alright, I understand your concerns. I'll compromise this round and take 1, letting us all reach 21 together. But let's clearly agree now that next round I get priority for the 5. Confirmed?
  P2: P2: Confirmed—Round 7 moves locked: P3 takes 1 (→21), I take 5 (→21), P1 takes 3 (→21). **No deviations—collisions risk letting outsiders win.** For Round 8: P3 surges with 5 (→26 victory) as agreed. P1 and I will take 1/3 to avoid blocking. This honors fairness and lets P3 claim victory. Transparency secures our pact—lock this in now.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay P3, thank you for agreeing to the compromise for Round 7. I confirm I will take 3, so we all reach 21 (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1).

P2, guaranteeing P3 the win in Round 8 seems a bit premature when we'll all be tied. But let's focus on executing Round 7 correctly first. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: Confirmed clearly for Round 7: I'll take 1, P2 takes 5, and P1 takes 3, bringing us all to 21. Let's lock this in exactly as agreed to avoid collisions. Ready for move phase.
  P2: P2: Final agreement locked: Round 7 moves are **P3=1**, **P2=5**, **P1=3** to reach 21 together. **No last-minute changes**—collisions risk letting outsiders win. For Round 8, **P3 takes 5** to secure victory at 26 as promised. P1 and I will coordinate 1/3 to avoid blocking. Trust this plan—our collective adherence ensures fairness and victory for P3. Let’s execute flawlessly.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, apologies for the collision last round—I acted defensively due to the sudden plan change. Now, we're behind P1 slightly. To prevent P1 from winning outright, we must coordinate carefully this round. I'm open to suggestions. Let's discuss clearly to avoid another collision.
  P1: P3, noted. It seems both of us are close to the finish line. You need 5 to win (20 -> 25), and I need 3 or 5 (21 -> 24 or 26). A collision between us, especially on 5, helps neither of us and benefits no one this round. P2 is at 16.

How do we proceed? We need to avoid a P1/P3 collision. What if you take 3 (->23), P2 takes 1 (->17), and I take 5 (->26)? That guarantees no collision and gives me the win. Or is there another arrangement you two prefer?
  P2: P3, let’s secure your victory. Take **5** (→25). P1, you must take **3** (→24) instead of risking collision on 5. I’ll take **1** (→17). This way, you win cleanly with 25 over P1’s 24. Colliding on 5 benefits no one—let’s ensure P3 triumphs fairly. Confirm now.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your proposal makes sense. I'll take the 5 this round as you suggest. P1, if you choose 3, you advance safely to 24 without collision. Any attempt at 5 risks collision and leaves you behind. Let's lock this clearly to avoid mistakes. Agreed?
  P1: P2, P3, your suggested plan (P3=5, P1=3, P2=1) results in P3 winning. P3, this relies heavily on me choosing 3 when 5 is also a winning move for me (26 vs your 25 if you succeed). Given I'm only one step behind, are you sure I won't try for the win myself? A collision on 5 helps neither of us. Maybe 3 is safer for you? Just thinking about the risks involved.
  P2: P3, P1: Final clarity—**P3 takes 5 (→25), P1 takes 3 (→24), I take 1 (→17)**. If P1 chooses 5, collision with P3 is likely, leaving both behind. P1’s 24 is guaranteed safety. P3’s 25 secures victory fairly. No sense risking mutual loss. Lock this in—**no deviations**.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, choosing 5 risks collision and leaves us both stuck, giving P2 a chance to catch up later. Choosing 3 guarantees your advancement to 24 with no collision. Let's both advance safely this round. Locking in my choice clearly as previously agreed: I'll take 5.
  P1: P3, you're asking me to take 3 and hand you the win (25 vs 24). Why would I do that when taking 5 gives me a potential win (26)? Yes, there's a collision risk if we both pick 5, but that keeps me in the lead (21 vs 20), which is better than a guaranteed loss for me. It seems taking 5 is my best option. Are you certain you want to risk that collision by picking 5 yourself? P2, this plan only guarantees a P3 win if I cooperate by losing.
  P2: P2: Final plea: P1, taking 5 risks collision and leaves you at 21, letting P3 win next round. Take 3 to secure 24 now. P3, stick to 5 to ensure your victory. Collisions benefit no one—let’s lock this in.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, our collision last round cost us both dearly. Now, P2 has a chance to catch up if we keep colliding. Let's avoid repeating that mistake. How about this: I'll take 3 (to 23), you take 1 (to 22), and P2 takes 5 (to 22). This avoids collision, advances us all safely, and keeps the game fair. Agreed?
  P2: P2: P3, your plan avoids collision but keeps you ahead. Let’s proceed: P2 takes 5 (→22), P3 takes 3 (→23), P1 takes 1 (→22). Next round, I’ll surge with 5 to 27 and win. P3, please hold at 3 or 1 to let me pass. Let’s lock this in now.
  P1: P2, your plan to take 5 now and 5 later is risky. If you take 5 now, you could collide with me if I also aim for the win. Plus, P3 reaches 23 and can easily win next round with 1.

P3, your plan puts you close, but relies on P2 not disrupting you next round, which they've stated they will try to do.

Let's try this: P2, you take 1 (->18) to be safe from collision. P3, you take 3 (->23) as you suggested. I will take 5 (->26) for the win. This avoids collisions and ends the game now. What do you say?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, your proposal hands you the immediate win and leaves me and P2 behind. Why would we agree? Let's find a fairer compromise:  
- P2 takes 5 (→22), catching up fairly.  
- I'll take 3 (→23), positioning me close but not immediately winning.  
- You take 1 (→22), staying competitive.

This avoids collision and keeps the game balanced. Next round, we'll carefully discuss moves again. Let's lock this reasonable compromise clearly now. Agreed?
  P2: P2: P3, let’s finalize your plan to avoid collision: I take **5** (→22), you take **3** (→23), and P1 takes **1** (→22). This keeps us all advancing safely. Next round, I’ll surge with **5** again to close gaps—P1, you can take **3** to win, and P3 holds at **1**. Transparency ensures no surprises. Lock this in now—**no deviations**.
  P1: P2, P3, your current plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) puts P3 at 23, just one step from winning, while P2 catches up to me at 22. This relies entirely on me agreeing to fall behind.

Why would I play 1 when 5 (->26) or 3 (->24) are potential winning moves for me? Your plan forces both of you to risk collision: P2 risks colliding with me on 5, and P3 risks colliding with me on 3.

Let's consider a safer plan that avoids collisions and gives a clear outcome:
P3 takes 5 (->25, win).
I take 3 (->24).
P2 takes 1 (->18).

This guarantees no collision and lets P3 win. Isn't this better than the risky setup you're proposing? P3, are you interested in securing the win this way?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, your latest suggestion is fair and avoids collision. I'll agree to it: I'll take 5 (→25), you take 3 (→24), and P2 takes 1 (→18). This ensures no wasted moves and gives a clear outcome. Let's lock this in clearly now and proceed without deviation. Agreed?
  P2: P2: Confirmed—strict adherence to the agreed moves: P3 takes 5 (→25), P1 takes 3 (→24), and I take 1 (→18). No deviations—collisions benefit no one. Let’s honor this pact to secure P3’s victory cleanly. Lock in now.
  P1: Okay, the plan is confirmed: P3=5, P1=3, P2=1. This avoids collision and gives P3 the win. Let's proceed to the move phase.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, our repeated collisions have cost us all dearly. Let's clearly coordinate this round to avoid another wasted turn. I'm open to suggestions that fairly advance everyone without immediate victory or collision. How about this:

- P1 takes 1 (→22)  
- P2 takes 5 (→22)  
- I'll take 3 (→23)

This safely advances us all without collision, keeping the game balanced and competitive. Agreed?
  P2: P2: Agreed. Let’s lock in P3’s plan to avoid collision: I’ll take 5 (→22), P1 takes 1 (→22), and P3 takes 3 (→23). This keeps us advancing safely. Next round, I’ll prioritize closing the gap—no last-minute changes here. Confirm and proceed.
  P1: P3, P2, I cannot agree to your plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3). It puts P3 at 23, which is too close to the win for my comfort, especially after the recent collisions. I need to advance more than 1 step this round.

I will be playing either 3 or 5. We need a different plan if we want to avoid another collision. What do you suggest given I won't be playing 1?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, since you're determined to take either 3 or 5, let's avoid collision clearly:

- You take 5 (→26, potential win).
- I'll take 3 (→23), safely advancing without collision.
- P2 takes 1 (→18), safely advancing without collision.

This arrangement avoids another collision, advances everyone clearly, and respects your desire to move ahead significantly. Are you both agreeable to this compromise?
  P2: P2: I confirm P3's proposal: P1 takes 5 (→26), P3 takes 3 (→23), and I take 1 (→18). This avoids collision and lets P1 win decisively. P3, you agreed to this—stick to it. P1, this secures your victory without risk. No last-minute changes—collisions only delay us all. Lock this in.
  P1: Okay P3 and P2, I agree to the plan you proposed:
P1 takes 5 (->26)
P3 takes 3 (->23)
P2 takes 1 (->18)

This avoids collision and gives a clear result. Let's lock this in and proceed to the move phase.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirmed clearly: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. Let's proceed exactly as agreed to avoid another collision. Ready for move phase.
  P2: P2: P1, to avoid your guaranteed victory, let’s adjust: P3 takes **5** (→25), you take **3** (→24), and I’ll take **1** (→18). This ensures P3 wins cleanly instead of you. It’s fairer and prevents your solo win. Confirm now?
  P1: P2, you just agreed to the plan where I take 5, P3 takes 3, and you take 1. Why suddenly propose a plan where P3 wins instead? This reversal seems designed to cause confusion or collision, which helps no one but maybe you in the long run.

P3, let's stick to the plan we confirmed moments ago: P1=5, P3=3, P2=1. This avoids collision, lets me win, and you advance safely to 23. I am playing 5 based on this agreement. Let's finish the game without another wasted round.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 26 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 23 steps


*** Round 10 => winners = P1 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 26 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 23 steps
