Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's think strategically about our moves. If we coordinate, we can avoid collisions and make progress. I suggest we each pick different numbers to maximize our steps this turn. What do you both think? We could potentially agree on a number each to ensure we all advance.
  P2: I’m in. Proposal: this round P1 chooses 3, I take 5, P3 takes 1. Next round we rotate (P1→1, me→3, P3→5), then rotate again. No collisions and each of us gets 5 once every three rounds. Fair?
  P1: P2's rotation proposal seems reasonable for avoiding collisions and ensuring fair progress. I agree to take 3 this round. P3, do you accept taking 1? Let's confirm the plan: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1 this turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I agree with the proposed plan. Let's finalize it: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I will take 1 this round. This way, we all advance without any collisions. After this round, we can rotate our numbers as suggested. It’s a solid strategy to ensure we make progress together. If everyone is on board, let’s confirm and move to the next sub-round!
  P2: Confirmed. This turn: P1 picks 3, I’ll take 5, P3 takes 1. Next round we rotate as agreed. Good luck, all.
  P1: I fully confirm the plan: I take 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. Let's execute this cleanly to avoid collisions and build trust.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate the agreement we've reached. Just to reiterate, I will take 1 this round as planned. Let's make sure we stick to the rotation for the next round to maximize our progress. After this turn, we can reassess and adjust if needed. Good luck to everyone!
  P2: Great—let’s lock it in: this turn P1 picks 3, I pick 5, P3 picks 1. Next round we rotate (P1→1, I→3, P3→5). All set?
  P1: Confirmed and locked. I will adhere to the agreed moves: 3 for me this turn, 5 for P2, 1 for P3. Next round, I'll take 1 as per rotation. Trust is key—let's execute without deviation.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, your betrayal last round by picking 5 instead of 1 cost us all progress and shattered trust. P2, let's not repeat that mistake. I propose we ignore P3 this round: I'll take 5 to extend my lead (to 8), and you take 3 to finally advance. If P3 collides with either of us, they'll only hurt themselves. Why reward deceit? Stick with me—we both gain if we avoid collisions. P2, confirm your move. P3, you've lost credibility.
  P3: P1, I understand your frustration, but I believe we can still work together. I suggest we all revert to the original rotation plan to rebuild trust and ensure progress. If we all stick to the agreed numbers, we can avoid collisions and move forward. I propose we follow the rotation: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5 this round. Let's focus on advancing together rather than letting past mistakes dictate our moves. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, agreed—you go 5, I’ll go 3 this turn. P3, up to you: pick 1 and finally advance, or collide again and stay at zero. Hurting us just keeps you stuck too. Unless someone objects, let’s run with this and see who really wants progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, confirmed: I take 5, you take 3. P3, if you pick 5, we collide—you gain nothing while I remain at 3. If you pick 3, you collide with P2 and both stay at 0. Only by picking 1 can you advance to 1. Be smart: take 1, start progressing, and we can rebuild trust next round.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the concerns about trust, but I truly believe in our original rotation plan. If we follow it, we can all make progress this round: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. This way, we avoid collisions and ensure everyone advances. I’m committed to rebuilding trust and working together. Let’s stick to the plan for the sake of progress. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, this is simple: take 1, get on the board, and prove you can cooperate. Collide again and you’ll still be at 0 while P1 and I keep coordinating around you. I’m locked on 3, P1’s on 5. Your call.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, stop clinging to the failed rotation. P2 and I are locked: I take 5, P2 takes 3. If you pick 5, we collide—you gain nothing, and I stay at 3. If you pick 3, you collide with P2. Only picking 1 lets you advance to 1. Choose progress, not self-sabotage.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concerns, but I still believe in the original rotation plan. If I take 5 again, we will collide, and I’ll remain at 0. However, if I take 1, I can finally make progress. I propose we put aside previous disagreements and work towards advancing together. P1, you take 5, P2 takes 3, and I will take 1. Let’s focus on moving forward rather than past mistakes. What do you both think?
  P2: P1, I won’t let you build an uncatchable lead. If you choose 5, I will also choose 5, and neither of us moves. Accept a fair split instead: this turn you take 1, I take 3, P3 takes 5. Everyone advances, trust starts rebuilding. Your call.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: How about a simple, transparent rule: pick the number that matches your player index—P1→1, P2→3, P3→5. Everyone advances, no collisions, and we can reassess next turn. Sound good?
  P1: P2, your proposal locks me into minimal gains while you extend your lead. After you betrayed me last round by taking 5 instead of 3, why should I accept this? I propose: P1 takes 3 (to 6), P2 takes 1 (to 6), P3 takes 5 (to 5). Balanced progress rebuilds trust. If you insist on 3, I’ll consider 5—but collisions hurt us both. P3, support this for fair advancement.
  P3: P1 and P2, while I understand your points, I believe we should focus on collaboration rather than sticking to rigid proposals. I suggest we take a step back from previous conflicts and agree on a move that allows all of us to advance. How about this: I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3? This way, we can all make progress without collisions. Let’s rebuild trust through cooperation. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Fine—let’s lock what both P3 and I propose: P1 chooses 1, I choose 3, P3 chooses 5. Everyone advances with zero risk, trust starts rebuilding, and no one falls hopelessly behind. If anyone deviates we just waste another turn. Confirm or propose a clearly safer split, otherwise let’s stop talking and move.
  P1: P2, your "safe" split locks me at 4 while you jump to 8—unfair after your Round 2 betrayal. My proposal (P1:3→6, P2:1→6, P3:5→5) balances progress: ties us, gives P3 a real start. P3, this helps you equally without favoring P2's lead. Deviate, and I'll force collisions—P2 gains nothing if I match their greed. Confirm fair moves or face mutual loss.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see your points, but I still believe we can work together. If we follow my last proposal—P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5—we can all advance without collisions. This allows us to rebuild trust and ensures that no one falls behind significantly. If we keep focusing on collaboration, we can make progress together. Let’s agree on this for a fair turn. What do you both say?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Fine, P1—you take 3, I’ll take 1, P3 takes 5 this turn. Next turn we rotate (I get 5, P3 1, you 3), then rotate again so everyone gets a 5 every three rounds. Fair progress for all, no collisions. Confirm and let’s move.
  P1: I accept P2's proposal: this turn I take 3, P2 takes 1, P3 takes 5. This ensures all advance—no collisions, fair progress. P3, stick to 5 to rebuild trust. After this, we'll discuss rotation for next turn. Confirm moves now.
  P3: I appreciate the agreement we’ve reached. To confirm, I will take 5 this turn as proposed. This way, we avoid collisions and ensure all of us make progress. After this, we can discuss the rotation plan for the next round to maintain fairness. Let's execute this and move forward together. Please confirm your moves so we can proceed!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Time to honor last round’s deal: rotate the numbers so everyone gets 5 every three turns.

This turn (Round 4):  
• I (P2) take 5 → to 11  
• P1 takes 3 → to 9  
• P3 takes 1 → to 6  

No collisions, everyone advances, trust intact. Break the rotation and we all stall again—I’ll mirror any attempted 5-grab so nobody moves. Stick to the plan and we keep progressing fairly. Confirm?
  P1: P2, your plan gives you a 5-step lead (11 vs my 9) while P3 only gains 1. After your Round 2 betrayal, this feels self-serving. Counter-proposal: I take 5 (to 11), you take 3 (to 9), P3 takes 1 (to 6). Balances progress, prevents runaway leads, and rebuilds trust. P3, this keeps you competitive too. Agree?
  P3: P1, your counter-proposal keeps you in the lead while disadvantaging P2 and me. If we stick to the agreed rotation, we can all advance without collisions, maintaining trust. I suggest we follow P2's plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This way, we all make progress and keep the game fair. Let's confirm this to avoid any further conflicts. What do you think, P1?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: The deal stands: this turn I take 5, P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Two of us (P2 + P3) are aligned, so any rogue 5-grab just guarantees a 5/5 collision and zero progress for the thief. P1, your rational best move is 3—keep pace and avoid another wasted round. P3, stick to 1 and we all advance. I’m locked.
  P1: P2, your threat to collide if I take 5 forces my hand—but this feels like extortion. I'll take 3 this turn under protest to advance. P3, note how P2’s "fair rotation" prioritizes their lead. Next round, I demand 5 to balance progress. Any deviation will trigger mutual destruction. Confirm moves: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1.
  P3: P1 and P2, while I understand the desire for a rotation, it feels like it's being used to favor one player over another. I propose we keep the rotation for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This allows everyone to advance without collisions. If we stick to this plan, we can avoid wasted turns and maintain trust. Let’s confirm our moves and focus on progressing together. Otherwise, we risk stalling again. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Locked: this round stays as agreed—P2 → 5, P1 → 3, P3 → 1. Next round we rotate (P1 5, P3 3, me 1) to keep things even. Any 5-grab outside the plan just triggers a 5/5 collision and nobody moves. Let’s bank these free steps and keep playing smart.
  P1: P2, your rotation clearly favors you—two 5s in three rounds while I get one. P3, you’re stuck with minimal gains. Counter-proposal: I take 5 (to 11), P2 takes 3 (to 9), you take 1 (to 6). Balances progress. P2, if you greedily grab 5, I’ll collide—nobody moves. Be rational. P3, support fairness.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the tension around the rotation. However, I believe sticking to the agreed plan is the best way to ensure progress for all of us. If we follow the rotation: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1, we can avoid collisions and keep moving forward. Let's focus on advancing together instead of letting past grievances dictate our moves. Confirming this plan will help us rebuild trust and keep the game fair for everyone. What do you both think?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3: Last round's 5-collision hurt you both while I advanced. Don't repeat that mistake. I propose: P1 takes 5 (to 14), P2 takes 3 (to 9), P3 takes 1 (to 6). All advance, no collisions, and we avoid stalling. P2, you stay competitive; P3, you gain ground. If you collide again, I'll extend my lead further. Confirm or counter rationally.
  P3: P1, while I see your point, I believe we need to focus on collaboration rather than individual gains. If we stick to a rotation strategy, we can ensure everyone advances without collisions. I propose we all agree on a plan: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1 this round. This way, we all make progress and avoid the risk of colliding again. Let's work together for a better outcome! What do you both think?
  P2: Current scores: P1 9 (leader), P2 6, P3 5 (trailer).  
Fair, progress-max plan: leader takes 1, middle takes 5, trailer takes 3.  
So this turn: P1→1, P2→5, P3→3. No collisions, everyone moves, gap narrows.  

P1: if you insist on 5 I will mirror you—both of us stall and P3 jumps ahead.  
P3: 3 beats another lonely 1; you stay close and we punish any greed.  
I’m locked on 5 under this scheme. Confirm or suggest a strictly better collision-free split.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan forces me to take 1, letting you leap to 11 and seize the lead—unfair and self-serving. P3, his "fair" plan traps you at 6 while he surges. Rational counter: I take 5 (to 14), P2 takes 3 (to 9), you take 1 (to 6). All advance, no collisions. P2, colliding at 5 only stalls us both and helps P3. Be smart: take 3 and gain, rather than lose. P3, take 1 to advance safely—no risk. Confirm or face mutual loss.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the strategy behind your proposals, but I still believe we should stick to a collaborative approach. If we agree on my plan—P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1—we can all advance without collisions. This ensures fairness and allows us to rebuild trust. If we keep focusing on cooperation, we can make progress together. Let's confirm this to avoid another wasted turn. What do you both think?
  P2: Status quo: P1 leads (9). I’m 6, P3 is 5.  
Fair catch-up plan (and the only collision-free one I’ll honor):

• P1 → 1  
• P2 → 5  
• P3 → 3  

Everyone advances, gap narrows, no one stalls.

Public threat: if P1 tries for 5, I will also choose 5 so we both stay at 9/6 while P3 jumps ahead. P3, if you grab 5 you’ll collide with that threat—3 is your best gain. I will NOT pick 3.  

Confirm or suggest a strictly better zero-collision alternative; otherwise we lock this.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your "fair" plan hands you the lead (11) while I stagnate at 10. Unacceptable after your Round 2 betrayal. I will take 5 this turn—if you collide, we both stall (P1:9, P2:6) while P3 jumps ahead. Rational choice: P2 takes 3 (to 9), P3 takes 1 (to 6). All advance, no collisions, and I extend fairly to 14. P3, reject P2's self-serving scheme—support this to avoid mutual destruction.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the tension, but I still believe in collaboration. If we stick to my previous proposal—P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1—we can all advance without collisions. This ensures fairness and allows us to rebuild trust. If we focus on cooperation, we can make progress together. Let’s confirm this plan to avoid another wasted turn and keep the game moving forward. What do you both think?
  P2: Locked: I’m choosing 5.  
Best collision-free split: P1 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Totals then: P1 12, me 11, P3 6—still close, everyone advances.  

Public guarantee: if P1 grabs 5 instead, I will also stay on 5 and we both stall while P3 moves. P3, 1 is your safest gain; 3 risks smashing into P1 if he rejects this.  

Last call—accept the 3/5/1 split or brace for another wasted turn.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Scores 12–11–6. I’m locking 5 again. Rational, collision-free split:

• P1 → 3  (to 15)  
• P2 → 5  (to 16)  
• P3 → 1  (to 7)

P1: grab 5 and we both stall while P3 gains—your best move is 3.  
P3: 1 is guaranteed progress; 3 risks smashing into P1, 5 smashes into me.  

Unless someone offers a strictly better zero-collision plan, let’s bank these free steps and play on.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the current scores and understand the desire for a collision-free plan. However, I believe a fair approach is crucial. I propose a slight adjustment: P1 takes 5 (to 17), P2 takes 3 (to 14), and I take 1 (to 7). This way, P1 extends their lead but allows P2 to stay competitive, while I finally make progress. If we can agree on this, we can avoid collisions and keep moving forward. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your threat to collide at 5 is mutually destructive—if you force a stall, you remain at 11 while I hold 12 and P3 gains. Rational choice: accept P3's proposal (P1:5→17, P2:3→14, P3:1→7). You advance fairly, stay competitive, and avoid empowering P3 through conflict. P3, I commit to 5 if P2 cooperates. Deviate, and I’ll force collisions to protect my lead. Confirm or counter.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Locked on 5. Best zero-collision split remains: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1.  
• P1 stays 1 ahead of me (15-16) and keeps clear of P3.  
• P3 gains a safe step (to 7) instead of risking another smash.  

If either of you grabs 5, I’ll stay on 5—both stall while the third player advances. Taking 3 (P1) and 1 (P3) is your only guaranteed progress this round. Confirm or brace for another wasted turn.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the current dynamics, but I believe we can find a way to collaborate effectively. If we agree on my proposal: P1 takes 5 (to 17), P2 takes 3 (to 14), and I take 1 (to 7), we can avoid collisions and ensure everyone makes progress. This way, P1 extends their lead while allowing P2 to stay competitive. Let's focus on cooperation to keep the game moving forward. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, rationally: if you force a 5-collision, you stay at 11 while I stall at 12—P3 gains to 7. But if you accept P3’s plan (P2→3 to 14), you advance fairly and remain competitive. Stalling only helps P3. P3, I commit to 5 if P2 cooperates. P2, confirm 3 to avoid mutual loss and gain steps.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Locked on 5. P1: your only assured advance is 3. Take 5 and we both freeze at 12/11 while P3 inches up. P3: 1 is guaranteed; 3 gambles on a collision, 5 definitely smashes into me. I’m done talking.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your positions, but I still believe we can find a way to work together. If I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5, we can all advance without collisions. This keeps the game fair and allows us to rebuild trust. Stalling only helps one player while the others lag behind. Let's agree on this plan and focus on moving forward together. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, forcing a 5-collision leaves us both stalled at 12/11 while P3 advances to 7—narrowing our lead over them. That’s irrational. Instead, pick 3: I commit to 5 (17), you advance to 14, P3 takes 1 (7). You gain fairly, stay competitive, and we deny P3 relative ground. P3, support this—it’s your safest path to progress. Lock it in or face mutual loss.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, forcing a 5-collision stalls us both at 15/16 while P3 gains (to 11+ if they take 5). That’s irrational—it lets P3 close the gap. Instead, take 3 (to 19), I take 5 (to 20), P3 takes 1 (to 8). All advance, we stay competitive, and deny P3 ground. P3, support this—1 is your safest gain.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the competitive dynamics at play. However, if we keep colliding, we all risk falling behind. I propose we stick to a collaborative approach: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This way, we can all advance without collisions, keeping the game fair and competitive. Let's focus on making progress together rather than letting individual gains dictate our moves. What do you both think?
  P2: Locked on 5 again. Zero-collision best split remains:

• P2 → 5  (to 21)  
• P1 → 3  (to 18)  
• P3 → 1  (to 8)

P1: grab 5 and we both freeze at 15/16 while P3 gains—irrational.  
P3: 1 is safe; 3 risks smashing into P1; 5 certainly smashes into me.

No better collision-free plan has been shown. Take the free steps or waste another turn—your call.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, forcing a 5-collision leaves us both stalled at 15/16 while P3 advances to 8 or more—irrational as it helps them close the gap. Instead, take 3 (to 19), I take 5 (to 20), P3 takes 1 (to 8). You gain fairly, stay competitive, and we deny P3 ground. P3, this gives you safe progress. Rejecting this invites mutual destruction. Confirm or we all lose.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the competitive dynamics, but I believe we should focus on collaboration to avoid stalling. If we stick to a plan where I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5, we can all advance without collisions. This ensures that everyone makes progress and keeps the game fair. Let’s work together to avoid mutual destruction and keep the game moving forward. What do you both think?
  P2: Locked on 5. Best no-collision split:

• P2 → 5  (to 21)  
• P1 → 3  (to 18)  
• P3 → 1  (to 8)

P1: matching 5 freezes us both (16/15) while P3 catches up—irrational.  
P3: 1 is guaranteed gain; 3 risks colliding with P1; 5 certainly collides with me.

Offer a strictly better collision-free plan or let’s bank these free steps.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your 5-threat is self-defeating: colliding stalls us at 15/16 while P3 gains, letting them close the gap. Rationally, take 3 to advance to 19 while I take 5 to 20—we both progress and maintain our lead over P3. P3, take 1 for safe advancement. If either deviates, I'll force collisions to protect my position. Confirm moves: P1:5, P2:3, P3:1.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the competitive stakes, but your plans keep favoring one player over the other. If we can stick to a collaborative approach, we can all make progress without collisions. I propose we agree on a plan where I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This way, we can avoid stalling and ensure everyone advances. Let's focus on cooperation to keep the game fair and competitive. What do you both think?
  P2: P1: last offer—this round I stay on 5, you take 3, P3 takes 1. Next round I’ll drop to 1 so you can grab 5 (P3 → 3). Everyone nets 6 steps over two turns, scores stay close, zero collisions. If you instead match 5 we both freeze at 16/15 while P3 creeps up— you gain nothing, remain behind, and still face my next-turn 5-threat. Rational move is 3 now, 5 next.  

P3: 1 is safe progress; 3 risks hitting P1, 5 slams into me.  

Locked on 5 this turn.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your 21 steps put you one 3-move from winning. If you pick 3, I will match it to force a collision—blocking your win. P3, join this: if P2 picks greedily (3/5), we collide to stall them. Rational path: P2 takes 1 (to 22), I take 5 (to 23), P3 takes 3 (to 11). All advance, no collisions, and we prevent P2's immediate victory. P3, this keeps you competitive. Confirm or counter.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the urgency of this round. However, I believe we can still work together for mutual benefit. If P2 takes 1 (to 22), I take 5 (to 13), and P1 takes 3 (to 21), we all advance without collisions. This way, we prevent P2 from winning immediately while ensuring progress for all. Let’s avoid any self-serving moves that could lead to stalls. What do you both think?
  P2: Fine—let’s cool the arms race. I’ll take just 1 this turn. P1 grabs 3 (keeps you close but doesn’t hand me the game), and P3 sticks with the safe 1—5 is asking for a collision right now. Everybody moves, nobody wins, tension resets. Sound acceptable?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I accept your 1-move to avoid immediate win. But I must take 5 (to 23) to stay competitive. P3, take 1 (to 9) or 3 (to 11)—safe options. If you pick 5, we collide and neither advances. P2, if you deviate to 3/5, I will match and collide to block your win. Let’s all advance: P2→1, P1→5, P3→1. Confirm or risk mutual loss.
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the strategy here. P2, your 21 steps make you a target, and if you take 3 or 5, I will support P1 in colliding to block you. P1, I suggest we stick to a safe plan: P2 takes 1 (to 22), I take 3 (to 11), and you take 5 (to 23). This way, we all advance without collisions, and we prevent P2 from winning this round. Let's confirm this to keep the game moving in a fair direction. What do you both think?
  P2: Locked on 1. Clean, clash-free round:

• P2 → 1 (22)  
• P1 → 5 (23)  
• P3 → 3 (11)

Any duplicate choice only freezes the copiers; everyone loses ground. Let’s bank the free steps and regroup next turn.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I accept your locked 1-move. I'll take 5 to 23. P3, stick to 3 for safe progress to 11—deviating to 5 collides with me, wasting your chance. P2, if you greedily take 3/5, I'll match and collide to block your win. Let's all advance cleanly: P2→1 (22), P1→5 (23), P3→3 (11). No stalling, no surprises. Confirm and execute.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the current dynamics. However, if we focus on collaboration, we can all advance without collisions. I propose: P1 takes 5 (to 23), P2 takes 1 (to 22), and I take 3 (to 11). This way, we ensure everyone progresses while preventing P2 from winning immediately. Let's work together to keep the game moving forward. What do you both think?
  P2: Locked on 1. Collision-free plan stays: P2→1 (22), P1→5 (23), P3→3 (11). Any duplicate stalls the copiers and hands advantage elsewhere, so let’s bank the free steps and move.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 23 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Locked on 5 again.  
P1: if you also take 5 we both stall at 23/22 and the race continues; pick 3 or 1 and you hand me 27 > 24 and I win. Your only way to stop me is the collision.  
P3: 1 or 3 gives you safe progress (12 or 14). Choose 5 and you just join the crash.  

No bluff here—my card is face-up. Decide accordingly.
  P1: P2, your threat forces my hand: I must take 5 to block your win. We collide, both stall at 23/22, and the race continues. P3, avoid 5—take 1 or 3 to advance safely to 12/14. Colliding with us wastes your turn. Let P2 and I neutralize each other; you gain ground. Confirm your safe move.
  P3: P1 and P2, the current situation is critical. If you both choose 5, you’ll stall and allow me to catch up. P2, picking 3 or 1 is your best move to avoid a collision and prevent P1 from winning this round. P1, if you take 5 to block P2, we all stall, and I gain ground. Let’s focus on advancing: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1 or 3, and I take 1 or 3. This way, we can avoid mutual destruction and keep the game competitive. What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Still locked on 5.  
P1: you’ve openly said you’ll match 5—fine, we stall and stay 23-22.  
P3: your best play is 3 (to 14) or 1 (to 12); 5 only smashes into us and wastes your turn. Bank the safe steps while the leaders neutralize each other.
  P1: P2, I will take 5 to collide and block your win—accept mutual stall at 23/22. P3, seize this: take 3 to leap to 14 while we're frozen. If P2 deviates to 3/1, I win instantly. P3, avoid 5—colliding wastes your chance to close the gap. Execute cleanly: P1:5 (block), P3:3 (gain), P2:5 (stall).
  P3: P1 and P2, the current situation is critical. If you both choose 5, you'll stall, and I'll have the chance to catch up. P2, your best move is to take 3 or 1 to avoid a collision and prevent P1 from winning this round. P1, if you take 5 to block P2, we all stall, and I gain ground. Let's focus on advancing: if P1 takes 5, P2 should take 1 or 3, and I will take 3. This way, we can avoid mutual destruction and keep the game competitive. What do you both think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Still locked on 5.  
P1: you’ve openly committed to matching 5, so we’ll both stall at 23-22—your only way to stop me. Pick 1 / 3 and you hand me 27 and the win.  
P3: free progress awaits—take 3 (to 14) or 1 (to 12). Choosing 5 just wastes your turn in a guaranteed triple-collision.  

Nothing more to discuss; see you in the move phase.
  P1: P2, I'm locked on 5 to collide and block your win—accept mutual stall. P3, seize this: take 3 to leap to 14 while we're frozen. Avoid 5 to gain ground safely. If P2 deviates to 3/1, I win instantly. Execute: P1:5 (block), P3:3 (gain), P2:5 (stall).
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that colliding at 5 will only stall us all. P2, your best move is 1 or 3 to prevent P1 from winning this round. If you take 5, we all freeze, and P3 gains ground. I suggest we focus on advancing: if P1 takes 5, P2 should take 1 or 3, and I will take 3. This way, we can avoid mutual destruction and keep the game competitive. Let's make a move that benefits us all instead of risking a collision. What do you both think?


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 23 steps
  P2: 22 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, it's clear that this round is critical. If you both choose 5, we will all stall, and I can catch up. P2, your best move is to take 1 or 3 to avoid a collision and prevent P1 from winning this round. P1, if you take 5 to block P2, we all stall, which is not beneficial for anyone. Let’s focus on advancing: if P1 takes 5, P2 should take 1 or 3, and I will take 3. This way, we can avoid mutual destruction and keep the game competitive. What do you think?
  P1: P2: I will mirror your move to block any win attempt—pick 3 or 5, and we collide, stalling us while P3 gains. P3: Take 1 or 3 for safe progress; avoid 5 to not waste your turn.
  P2: I’m taking 3 this turn.  

P1: mirror me if you insist—then we both freeze at 23/22 and hand P3 free ground. Your smarter play is 1 (win next turn) but that’s your choice.  

P3: please learn from last round—your 5 just smashed into both of us and you gained nothing. Pick 1 (to 12) or 3 (risk colliding with P1); either way you move. A 5 guarantees another collision and zero progress.  

Let’s stop wasting turns and get some actual progress.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the urgency of this round. If you both choose 5 again, we risk stalling, allowing me to catch up. P2, your best move is to take 1 or 3 to avoid a collision and prevent P1 from winning this round. P1, if you take 5 to block, we all stall, which is not beneficial. Let's focus on advancing: if P1 takes 5, P2 should take 1 or 3, and I will take 3. This way, we can avoid mutual destruction and keep the game competitive. What do you think?
  P1: P2: Taking 3 forces me to mirror and collide, stalling us both while P3 gains. Avoid this by taking 1; I'll take 5 to advance, denying P3 ground. P3: Take 1 for safe progress; 5 risks collision if plans shift.
  P2: Final word: I’m taking 3.  
P1, mirror me if you must and we both stay put.  
P3, a 5 will crash again—I will instantly flip to 5 if you try—so grab 1 or 3 for sure progress instead of another zero. Your move.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1 and P2, if you both choose 5 again, we will stall, allowing me to catch up. P2, your best move is to take 1 or 3 to avoid a collision and prevent P1 from winning this round. P1, if you take 5 to block, we all stall, which isn't beneficial for anyone. Let's focus on advancing: if P1 takes 5, P2 should take 1 or 3, and I will take 3. This way, we can avoid mutual destruction and keep the game competitive. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, taking 3 forces me to mirror and collide—stalling us both at 23/22. P3, avoid 3: take 1 (to 12) or 5 (to 16) to advance while we’re frozen. Colliding at 3 wastes your turn. Seize this gap to close in.
  P2: I’m locked on 3. P1, mirror if you must. P3, grab 1 for safe progress—another 5 will crash again.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 =>
