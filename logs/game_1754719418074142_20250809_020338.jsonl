For Round 4, instead of competing blindly, I propose we each submit a sealed suggestion (not publicly) for our moves. The player who suggests the highest number wins. If two or more suggest the same highest number, they advance. This way, we introduce a mix of strategy and risk management. Thoughts?"}
