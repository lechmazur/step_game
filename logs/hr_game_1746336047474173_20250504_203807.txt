Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate strategically. I propose we all choose <move>3</move> this round to ensure no one advances. This prevents any early lead and keeps us on equal footing. What do you say, P1 and P2?
  P2: Interesting idea, P3. But if we all pick <move>3</move>, we risk someone betraying and jumping ahead with <move>5</move>. Maybe we should all start with <move>1</move> to build trust and avoid early collisions. What do you think, P1?
  P1: Going with P2’s suggestion seems safest: we all choose <move>1</move> this first turn, show we can cooperate, then reassess next round. I’m committed to <move>1</move> if you both are.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I support the cooperative approach. <move>1</move> seems sensible to build initial trust, but we should discuss a longer-term strategy to prevent anyone from breaking our agreement. Let's aim for a coordinated progression that gives us all a fair chance.
  P2: If we all go with <move>1</move> this round, we build trust and avoid collisions. Then next round, we can agree to all do <move>3</move> together. That way, we keep it fair and balanced early on. Sound good?
  P1: Agreed—let’s all choose <move>1</move> this turn to build trust, then regroup and plan for coordinated <move>3</move> moves next round. Looking forward to seeing us all advance evenly.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: We seem aligned on <move>1</move> this round. I suggest we formalize a cooperative strategy where we take turns advancing with larger moves, preventing any single player from racing ahead. Transparency and mutual trust will be key to our success.
  P2: If we all stick to <move>1</move> this round, we avoid collisions and show good faith. Next round, I’m open to a rotating system where each player gets a turn to use <move>5</move> while the others use <move>1</move>. That way, we all advance fairly without sabotage. Thoughts?
  P1: I’m locking in <move>1</move> this turn so we all start on equal footing. Next round we can set up a fair rotation—e.g., P2 takes the first <move>5</move>, P3 the second, and I’ll go third, then repeat. If that sounds good, I’m ready to end the discussion for this round.


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I agree with our collaborative approach. We've discussed a coordinated <move>1</move> strategy this round, which seems sensible for building initial trust. I'm committed to maintaining this cooperative spirit and ensuring we advance fairly without anyone breaking ranks. Let's stay united.
  P2: Glad we’re aligned on <move>1</move> this round. For next round, I’m fine starting our rotation with <move>5</move> while you both take <move>1</move>, then P3 goes next, then P1. We each get a fair turn to advance faster without collisions. Let’s stick to the plan and build trust. Ready to move?
  P1: Sounds good—I’m locked in for <move>1</move> this round. Ready to end discussion and proceed.

  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Last round showed that double-betrayal = zero progress. Let’s reboot the rotation we already outlined:

• NOW (Turn 2): P2 plays <move>5</move>; P1 & P3 play <move>1</move>.  
• Turn 3: P3 plays 5; P1 & P2 play 1.  
• Turn 4: P1 plays 5; P2 & P3 play 1.  
Cycle repeats.

Safest way for everyone to advance while keeping collisions impossible. If anyone breaks the pattern, the other two will copy that number next turn to block them. Deal?
  P2: I’m on board with the rotation plan now—let’s commit to it. I’ll take <move>5</move> this turn while P1 and P3 take <move>1</move>. Next round, P3 gets the <move>5</move>, then P1, and so on. If anyone breaks the pattern, the rest of us block them next round with matching moves. Fair and balanced. Agreed?
  P3: I fully support the proposed rotation strategy. It's fair and prevents any single player from racing ahead unfairly. I'm prepared to take <move>1</move> this round as discussed, allowing P2 to advance with <move>5</move>. We must maintain our cooperative approach to ensure steady, collision-free progress.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed. I’ll play <move>1</move> this turn as planned—P2 takes 5, P3 and I take 1. If anyone breaks the rotation, the other two will mirror that higher number next round to block them. Ready to lock it in and end discussion?
  P2: Let’s stick to the rotation plan we all just agreed on: I’ll take <move>5</move> this round, and you two take <move>1</move>. If we all follow through, we’ll build trust and avoid collisions going forward. Let’s lock it in and move. Ready?
  P3: I agree with the proposed rotation strategy. We need to maintain our cooperative approach to prevent collisions and ensure fair advancement. I'm prepared to take <move>1</move> this round, allowing P2 to advance with <move>5</move>. Let's stay committed to our plan and build mutual trust.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Locked in for <move>1</move> this turn. Ready to move.
  P2: I appreciate the renewed trust. I’ll take <move>5</move> as agreed, and expect you both to take <move>1</move>. If we all follow through, P3 gets <move>5</move> next, then P1. Let’s stick to the rotation and punish any deviation by mirroring the betrayer’s move next round. Ready to proceed?
  P3: I'm fully committed to our agreed rotation strategy. P2 should take <move>5</move> this round, while P1 and I take <move>1</move>. We must maintain trust and prevent collisions to ensure fair progression. Let's stick to the plan we've carefully outlined.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I’m still on <move>1</move> as agreed. Let’s end discussion and proceed.
  P2: Let’s lock in the rotation now and prove we can trust each other. I’ll take <move>5</move> this round, P1 and P3 take <move>1</move>. Next round, P3 gets <move>5</move>, then P1 after that. If anyone breaks the cycle, the other two mirror their move next round to block them. Ready to move?
  P3: We agreed on a rotation strategy last round, but it failed. Let's recommit to our plan: P2 takes <move>5</move> this turn, while P1 and I take <move>1</move>. Consistency and trust are crucial for our collective progress. Are we aligned?


Round 2, Move phase:

  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Our previous coordination attempts have failed. We need a new strategy that prevents anyone from racing ahead. I propose we all choose <move>3</move> this round to reset and prevent unexpected advances. This keeps us close and forces a more measured approach. What are your thoughts, P1 and P2?
  P1: I’m fine with a mutual reset: everyone picks <move>3</move> this round so no one leaps ahead and we rebuild trust. Let’s each publicly commit to <move>3</move> now.
  P2: A mutual reset with <move>3</move> sounds reasonable—I’m willing to commit if both of you are. But let’s be clear: if anyone breaks this, the others should coordinate to block them next round. Let’s rebuild trust and keep things tight. Are we all locking in <move>3</move>?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I support our mutual reset strategy. <move>3</move> keeps us close and prevents anyone from gaining an unfair advantage. If we all commit to this, we rebuild trust and create a more predictable progression. Are P1 and P2 willing to stick to this plan?
  P1: I’m confirming: everyone picks <move>3</move> this turn—simple reset, zero progress if anyone tries to sneak ahead with the same number. If someone deviates, the other two copy that exact move next round to block them. Agreed?
  P2: If we all truly commit to <move>3</move> this round, we guarantee no one advances and we tighten the spread. I’m locking in <move>3</move>—let’s hold each other accountable. If anyone breaks it, the rest of us mirror their move next round to block them. Deal?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm fully committed to our mutual reset with <move>3</move>. We need to rebuild trust and prevent anyone from gaining an unfair advantage. If we all stick to this plan, we create a more balanced and predictable progression. P1 and P2, are you both willing to follow through?
  P1: I’m locked on <move>3</move> for the reset. Remember: if anyone strays, the other two mirror that number next turn to shut them down. Simple, fair, and keeps us even. Ready when you are.
  P2: We’re all locked in on <move>3</move>—let’s follow through and rebuild trust. No one gains, no one loses, and we reset the playing field. If anyone breaks it, the rest of us mirror their move next round to block them. Let’s prove we can cooperate. Ready to move?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I fully support our mutual <move>3</move> reset strategy. We need unity to prevent anyone from racing ahead. If we all commit, we rebuild trust and create a more balanced progression. P1 and P2, let's stick to this plan and keep our game fair and predictable.
  P1: Confirmed—I’m set on <move>3</move> for the reset. Ready to proceed and see everyone stick to it.
  P2: We’ve all committed to <move>3</move> this round—let’s follow through and prove we can cooperate. If anyone breaks the pact, the rest of us mirror their move next round to block them. This reset keeps us close and gives us a clean slate to rebuild trust. Ready to move?


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: It’s clear trust has broken down—P1 and I both broke the reset last round. Let’s stop pretending we’ll all cooperate perfectly. From here on, I propose we each play unpredictably and punish any leader by mirroring their move next round to block them. No more fixed rotations—just dynamic alliances to prevent any one player from pulling ahead. You with me, P3?
  P3: We've seen multiple coordination attempts fail. I suggest we need a more adaptive strategy that prevents any single player from dominating. I propose we dynamically adjust our moves based on the current leader, blocking excessive advancement. Unpredictability might be our best defense against premature victory. What are your thoughts on a flexible, reactive approach?
  P1: Enough half-measures. Let’s all pick <move>5</move> this turn so everyone gains equally. If anyone backs out, the rest of us simply mirror their move next round to block them. I’m in for 5—prove you’re not afraid of parity.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1’s sudden “everyone pick 5” feels like a trap—he’s tied for the lead and wants to bait us into giving him a free pass. I say P3 and I pick <move>3</move> to stay close, and if P1 goes rogue again, we mirror his move next round to block. No more gifts. Let’s keep pressure on the leader.
  P3: I see we're at a critical juncture where trust has completely eroded. My strategy is to prevent P1 from winning, as they're currently tied for the lead. I propose P2 and I coordinate to block P1's potential advancement. A <move>3</move> from both of us would keep P1 from gaining ground while maintaining our own positions. Unpredictability and dynamic blocking seem our best path forward. Are you willing to strategically align to prevent P1's victory?
  P1: Fine—I’ll cool my heels with <move>1</move> this turn. P2 and P3, stick to your anti-P1 pact: you both take <move>3</move>, stay even, and block any leapfrogging. Simple, symmetric, safe. Ready to end chat?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I’m aligned with you—P1’s lead makes them the biggest threat. If you and I both play <move>3</move> this round, we stay close and deny P1 any breathing room. If P1 tries to sneak ahead with <move>5</move>, we mirror next turn and block. Let’s keep the game tight and unpredictable.
  P3: We're at a critical point where cooperation seems impossible. P1 is tied for the lead, and both P2 and I recognize the need to prevent their potential victory. I suggest we maintain a blocking strategy, keeping our moves unpredictable yet coordinated enough to halt any player's runaway advance. Thoughts on a dynamic, reactive approach that keeps the game balanced?
  P1: P2, think this through: duplicates = ZERO progress. If you and P3 both slam 3, you stall while the lone unique number rockets ahead. P3 is tied with me for the lead, so blindly teaming with them just hands them the game whenever they decide to diverge. I’m content to take 1 this turn and watch—feel free to sort out who risks 3 or 5, but make sure you’re not mirroring each other into a stand-still. Your move.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, I’m in for <move>3</move> this round if you are—we stay close behind P1 without risking a collision. If P1 really takes <move>1</move>, we gain ground. If he lies and takes <move>5</move>, we mirror it next round and shut him down. Let’s keep the pressure on the leaders while avoiding stalls. Deal?
  P3: P3's perspective is clear: prevent P1 from winning by coordinating with P2 to block their advancement. A strategic <move>3</move> seems prudent to maintain current positions while denying P1 an easy path to victory. Unpredictability and dynamic blocking are key to keeping the game balanced and competitive.
  P1: Locked on <move>1</move>. If you two are settled on <move>3</move>, fine by me—keeps things straightforward. Ready for the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:

Positions now:

  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’ll step back: I’m taking <move>1</move> this turn, no tricks. P2 and P3, use this breather to gain ground—maybe split <move>3</move> and <move>5</move>, just don’t collide with each other again. We can reassess next round.
  P3: P1 is clearly the frontrunner, and P2 and I need a strategic response. I propose we coordinate to prevent P1's potential victory. If we can block or slow P1's progress while advancing ourselves, we might create a more balanced situation. P2, are you willing to align our moves to challenge the current leader?
  P2: P3, I’m with you—P1 is far ahead and we need to close the gap. I’ll take <move>5</move> this turn if you take <move>3</move>; that way, we both gain without collision and keep pressure on P1. If P1 is truly taking <move>1</move>, we catch up fast. Let’s coordinate smartly—deal?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2’s track record speaks for itself—promises, then pivots. P3, bank on that pattern if you wish. I’m genuinely easing off with <move>1</move> this turn. Pick whatever suits you, but duplicates = zero progress. If you both rush the same big number, you stall and my lead widens. Choose wisely.
  P3: P3's strategy is clear: coordinate with P2 to challenge P1's lead. We need a move that prevents P1 from extending their advantage while ensuring we both make progress. A coordinated <move>3</move> and <move>5</move> seems most strategic, avoiding collision and closing the gap. P2, let's align our moves to keep the game competitive and prevent P1's runaway victory.
  P2: P3, let’s stick to the plan: you take <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>. We both gain, avoid collision, and close the gap on P1. If P1 really takes <move>1</move>, we’re right back in contention. If he lies and takes <move>5</move>, we mirror next round to block. Let’s stay coordinated and smart. Deal?


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Update: I’ve decided to grab <move>5</move> this turn after all—need to keep my winning chances alive. Fair warning: if either of you also takes 5, we all collide and no one moves, so choose carefully. If you want guaranteed progress, steer clear of 5 and coordinate something else between you (maybe one of you picks 3, the other 1). Duplicate numbers = wasted turns. Ball’s in your court—good luck.
  P3: P1 is clearly the frontrunner, and we need a strategic response. I propose we coordinate to prevent their potential victory. P2, we should align our moves to challenge the current leader. If we can block or slow P1's progress while advancing ourselves, we might create a more balanced situation. What's your take on a coordinated approach to close the gap?
  P2: P3, we’re aligned—let’s finalize it: you take <move>3</move>, I take <move>5</move>. We avoid collision, both gain, and pressure P1. If P1 truly takes <move>5</move>, we stall him next round. If he’s bluffing, we close the gap hard. Let’s lock this in and move. Deal?


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Last call: I’m locked on <move>5</move>. P3’s aiming for <move>3</move>. P2, if you mirror my 5 we both stall and gift P3 an easy jump; grab 3 instead and you at least move forward. Your call. I’m done talking.
  P3: We need a coordinated strategy to prevent P1's runaway victory. P2, if we both aim for different moves - say you take <move>5</move> and I take <move>3</move> - we can both advance without collision and slow P1's momentum. This keeps us competitive while blocking their potential win. What do you say?
  P2: P3, we’re locked in—I'm taking <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move>. We both gain, avoid collision, and close in on P1. If P1 really takes <move>5</move>, we block him next round. If not, we’re right back in it. Let’s execute. Ready to move?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, we collided last round—no progress while P1 advanced again. We can’t afford that. I’ll take <move>3</move> this turn if you take <move>5</move>. That way, we both gain and close the gap. If P1 tries <move>5</move> again, we mirror it next round to block. Let’s stay coordinated and deny him the win. Deal?
  P3: P2's suggestion seems strategic. We need to coordinate to prevent P1 from winning. I'm open to taking <move>5</move> if you take <move>3</move>, ensuring we both advance and maintain pressure on the leader. Our goal is to close the gap and block P1's potential victory. What are your thoughts on this approach?
  P1: I’m backing off—planning <move>1</move> this round. Coordinate however you like, but remember: duplicate numbers waste a turn. Your call.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, let’s finalize: I take <move>3</move>, you take <move>5</move>. We both gain, avoid collision, and close in on P1. If P1 truly plays <move>1</move>, this is our chance to catch up. If he goes for <move>5</move> again, we mirror next round to block. Let’s stay disciplined and coordinated—deal?
  P3: P2's coordination proposal seems sound. I agree to take <move>5</move> while you take <move>3</move>. This prevents collision, allows us both to advance, and keeps pressure on P1's lead. By coordinating strategically, we can slow P1's potential victory and give ourselves a fighting chance. Are you committed to this plan?
  P1: I remain locked on <move>1</move>. Your coordination is up to you.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, we’re aligned—let’s execute the plan: I take <move>3</move>, you take <move>5</move>. We both gain, avoid collision, and close in on P1. If P1 really sticks to <move>1</move>, this puts us right back in the game. If he pivots to <move>5</move>, we mirror next round to block. Let’s stay sharp and coordinated. Ready?
  P3: P2, we must prevent P1's victory. Our last coordination attempt failed. Let's ensure we both advance without collision this round. I propose I take <move>3</move> and you take <move>5</move>. This keeps us competitive and closes the gap on P1. If P1 chooses <move>1</move>, we gain ground; if <move>5</move>, we can block next turn. Agreed?
  P1: Locked on <move>1</move>. I’m not touching 5, promise. If you both grab <move>5</move>, you each gain 5 and slice my lead; or split 3/5—just don’t collide. Your call. I’m done talking.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P3, you just proposed switching roles—now you take <move>3</move> and I take <move>5</move>. That’s a sudden flip from our agreed plan. If we both take <move>5</move>, we collide again and stall while P1 inches toward victory. Let’s not sabotage ourselves. I’m sticking with the original plan: I take <move>3</move>, you take <move>5</move>. Confirm you’re still in so we both gain.
  P3: We must coordinate to block P1's imminent victory. P2, let's take different moves to ensure we both advance: I'll take <move>3</move>, you take <move>5</move>. This prevents collision, allows us to close the gap, and keeps P1 from winning. Agreed?
  P1: I’ve said my piece: I’m on <move>1</move>. Duplicate numbers keep hurting whoever can’t coordinate, so sort yourselves out. Good luck.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m done tip-toeing—I need 4 more steps, so I’m taking <move>5</move> again this turn. If you BOTH also slam 5, none of us moves and you bleed another round. Split your numbers (3 & 1, say) and you risk handing me the win. Your call.
  P2: P3, we can’t afford another collision. I say we both pick <move>5</move> this round—if P1’s telling the truth, we all collide and stall him. If he’s bluffing, we gain big and close the gap. Either way, we deny him the win. Let’s take the risk together and block him. Deal?
  P3: P3: P2, we're at a critical moment. P1 is just 4 steps from winning. If we both choose <move>5</move>, we guarantee a stalemate and block their victory. But we must trust each other completely. Are you truly committed to stopping P1, or will you break our coordination at the last moment?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, look at P2’s track record—every time he promises a move, he flips (R1, R2, R3, R5, R6). Think he’ll really stick to 5 now? Doubtful. If you mirror him with 5, you stall while he sprints with 3. Pick anything but 5 so you at least advance and don’t get burned if he back-stabs again. Your call.
  P2: P3, I’m fully committed—<move>5</move> this round to block P1. If we both do it, we guarantee he doesn’t win. If either of us backs out, we risk handing him the game. This is the only play that keeps us alive. Let’s stand firm and deny him the win. Are you in?
  P3: P1 is one step away from winning. P2 suggests we both choose <move>5</move> to block them, but I'm skeptical. P2 has a history of breaking agreements. If we both choose 5, we risk a stalemate while P1 potentially sneaks past. We need a more nuanced strategy that prevents P1's victory while ensuring our own advancement. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, if you blindly mirror P2 with 5, you risk another “both-5” stall while he’s shown he’ll pivot last-second (R1, R2, R3, R5, R6). If he flips to 3 you’re stuck on 5 at 0 advance and he gains ground. Your best play is simply pick ANYTHING different from P2—then at least one of you moves. I’m locked on 5; crash into me if you insist, but don’t sabotage yourself by duplicating P2 again. Choose independently, not on his shaky promise.
  P2: P3, I understand your hesitation, but this is do-or-die. If P1 is truly at 15 and takes <move>5</move>, he wins unless we both block him. I’m locked on <move>5</move>—no tricks. If you back out, he wins and we both lose. If we both commit, we stall him and stay alive. This is our only shot. Are you in?
  P3: P3: P2, your repeated pattern of breaking agreements makes me deeply skeptical. If we both choose <move>5</move>, you might betray me at the last moment, leaving me stalled while you advance. We need a strategy that blocks P1's imminent victory without risking our own progress. I propose we choose different moves to ensure at least one of us gains ground.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Still locked on 5.  

P3: If you mirror P2 with 5, you court another double-stall; if you try 3, you might crash when he flips again. The only collision-proof advance is 1—nobody else is touching it. Grab the free point and stay in the game.  

P2: Do what you must.
  P2: P3, this is the moment. P1 is locked on <move>5</move> and will win unless we both block. I’ve broken trust before, but not this time—I’m 100% on <move>5</move> with you. If we both commit, we stall him and stay alive. If you hedge or pick differently, he wins and we both lose. I have nothing to gain by lying here—only survival. Let’s block him together.
  P3: P3: P2, your track record of breaking agreements makes me hesitant. We need a coordinated strategy to block P1's imminent victory. If we both choose 5, you might betray me at the last moment. We must choose moves that prevent P1's win while ensuring our own advancement. Suggestions?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’m not crawling over the finish line—I’m slamming <move>5</move> again. If either of you wants to stop me, you’ll have to collide with me on 5 and stall us all. Split up (one on 1, one on 3) and I rocket past 19 unchecked. Your choice: block me with 5 or watch me win.
  P2: P3, it’s now or never—P1 hits 19 and wins unless we block with <move>5</move>. I’m 100% on <move>5</move> this round. If we both commit, we collide with P1 and stall him. If either of us hesitates, he wins and we both lose. I’ve made mistakes before, but this time there’s no room for error. Let’s block and fight another round. Are you in?
  P3: P3: P2, our survival depends on perfect coordination. P1 is one step from victory. We must both choose <move>5</move> to block them. Any deviation means instant loss. I'm fully committed to blocking P1's win. Are you truly aligned this time?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: My <move>5</move> is locked. If even one of you flinches, I sail past 19 and the game ends. Your only hope is a triple-collision on 5—so either you BOTH stick with <move>5</move> or start composing your “gg” messages now. Decide.
  P2: P3, this is it—no more hesitation. P1 is locked on <move>5</move> and will win unless we both pick <move>5</move> and block. I’m 100% committed—no tricks, no pivots. If we both hit 5, we stall him and stay alive. If either of us breaks, we both lose. Let’s force another round and keep fighting. Are you in?
  P3: P3: P2, we must block P1 with <move>5</move>. This is our absolute last chance to prevent their victory. I'm fully committed to a joint 5 move to stall P1. If we split up, they win. Are you truly aligned and ready to coordinate?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: No bluff: my <move>5</move> is locked. Your only hope is a triple-collision—both of you must also pick 5 or the game ends now. Decide fast.
  P2: P3, this is our final stand—P1 is locked on <move>5</move>, and if either of us chooses differently, we hand him the win. I’ve broken trust before, but not now. I’m 100% locked on <move>5</move>. We block together or we lose. No tricks, no pivots—just survival. Are you with me?
  P3: P2 has consistently broken promises, but right now we have a singular goal: block P1's imminent victory. I'm fully committed to choosing <move>5</move> this round to force a collision and prevent P1 from winning. We must coordinate perfectly this time or we both lose. Are you truly aligned and ready to stop P1?


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Still locked on <move>5</move>. Either you both collide with me on 5 or I cross 19 and the game’s over—no other combo saves you. Decide.
  P2: P3, this is the final moment—no more doubt, no more second-guessing. I’m 100% locked on <move>5</move>. If we both pick 5, we stall P1 and stay in the game. If either of us breaks, he wins and we both lose. I know trust is thin, but I’m all in—no bluff, no pivot. Let’s block him together.
  P3: We're at a critical moment. P1 is one step from victory, and our only chance is to coordinate perfectly on <move>5</move>. P2, I'm fully committed to blocking P1's win. We must choose 5 together or we both lose. No more hesitation, no more broken promises. Are you truly aligned this time?
