Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: How about we all pick 1 for this first move, so nobody collides and we each get a small start? I’m open to suggestions if you have a better idea.
  P1: Sounds good to me P2, let's all pick 1 for this first move to get started.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Let's stick to our plan: everyone picks 1 so we all move safely. P3, if you’re fine with that, let us know.
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, let's make sure we're all on the same page to pick 1 this round.  P3, are you in?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 =>

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 1 didn't go as planned. How about we try picking 3 this round? Hopefully we can all make some progress.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I’m fine with 3, but I don’t want a three-way collision again. P3, if you’re going to pick 5 again, let us know so we can adjust. P1, maybe we pick 3 together this turn? Either way, I’d like to hear from both of you before the move phase.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I'm leaning towards picking 3 this round as well. P3, are you planning to pick 5 again like last time? If so, maybe P2 and I should coordinate on a different number to ensure at least some of us make progress.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, since P3 is silent again, I’m worried they might go 5. Let’s avoid another triple collision. If you pick 1 and I pick 3, we can both advance unless P3 collides with one of us. At least this way we’re not all stuck at zero again. What do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I agree that picking 1 and you picking 3 makes sense to avoid another collision. Let's go with that plan. What do you think P3 is likely to do this round?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I’ll pick 3 if you pick 1. That way we avoid clashing, even if P3 goes for 5 again. P3, if you want to prevent a collision, choose something different from us. Let’s finally move forward.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2 and P3, last round we tried to avoid collision but P3 seems to be going for 5 regardless. How about this round we all pick different numbers again, but this time let's choose 5, 3, and 1 so we can all move? P2, how about you pick 3, P3 pick 1 and I pick 5?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I’m okay with your 5–3–1 plan in theory. I’ll pick 3. If P3 really picks 1, all three of us move. But if P3 ignores us and picks 5 again, you two will collide and I’ll advance safely. Let’s try it. If you want a different approach, let me know. Otherwise, I’m set on 3.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I will stick to picking 1 this round as we discussed.  Hopefully at least P2 and I can make some progress if P3 chooses 5 again. P3, are you going to pick 5 again?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, if you’re indeed taking 1, I’ll stick with 3. That way we only collide if P3 unexpectedly chooses the same as one of us. P3, if you don’t want a collision, pick 5 or something else. Let’s see who actually moves this time. Any objections? If not, I’m all set.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I'm confirming I will pick 1 this round as we discussed. Let's move forward if P3 picks something else.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I’m set on picking 3 this round. P1, you said you’ll pick 1. P3, if you’re going 5 again, then we might see another collision for you and P1. Let’s see how it plays out.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, let’s hamper P3 so they don’t get too far ahead. If you pick 5, you might collide with P3 if they also pick 5, stopping them from advancing. Meanwhile, I’ll pick 3 to move forward safely. What do you say?
  P1: Okay P2, that sounds like a plan. I'll pick 5 this round to try and block P3. Let's hope it works and we can close the gap.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Alright, let’s finalize our tactic. I’ll choose 3, and you choose 5. That way, if P3 goes for 5 again, you two collide and stop P3 from advancing, while I move forward. If P3 picks something else, at least we both make progress. Let’s go for it.
  P1: Okay P2, sounds like we have a solid plan to try and slow down P3 this round. I'm set to pick 5 as we discussed. Let's see if we can make P3 stumble a bit!
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, we’ve got a solid plan. I’ll pick 3, and you pick 5, so if P3 goes 5, they don’t advance. Let’s make it happen.
  P1: Okay P2, let's do it. I'll pick 5 to block P3 as we discussed. Let's see if we can slow them down this round.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s repeat last round’s approach, P1. You pick 5 to block P3 if they do 5 again, and I'll pick 3 to keep advancing. If P3 stays on 5, they collide with you and I edge ahead. If they pick something else, we both move forward. Are you in, P1? P3, if you don’t want a collision, choose a different number.
  P1: Okay P2, I'm thinking maybe we should switch things up this round.  Instead of me trying to block P3 with 5 again, how about I pick 3 to make some progress myself?  If you still want to block P3, maybe you could pick 5? That way if P3 goes for 5 again, they might collide with you instead, and I can gain some ground. What do you think?
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I’m fine with switching. You pick 3 to gain ground, and I’ll pick 5 in hopes of blocking P3 if they keep choosing 5. If they collide with me, you’ll advance while I keep them stuck. If they pick something else, I move ahead. Let’s try it.
  P1: P2, got it. I'm picking 3. Let's see how this round goes.
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I’m committed to that switch we discussed—go for 3 this time so you can gain ground. If P3 insists on 5 again, I’ll try to block them. P3, if you want to avoid another collision, maybe consider a different move. Let’s see who actually advances.
  P1: Okay P2, sounds like we're set then. I'm picking 3 as we discussed to try and make some progress this round. Let's see what P3 does.
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, P3 is sticking with 5. How about you pick 5 to block P3 again, and I'll pick 3 to make progress? If P3 picks 5, you block them and I gain ground. What do you think?
  P2: I’m willing to try your plan again, P1—if you pick 3, I’ll pick 5 and attempt to block P3. That way, if P3 sticks with 5, they stay put while you move ahead. If P3 switches to a smaller number, I’ll leap forward. This approach at least keeps us competitive. Let’s see if P3 changes course.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay P2, sounds like a good plan. I'll pick 3 again this round to keep making progress while you try to block P3 with 5. Let's see if this strategy works out again and we can close the gap on P3.
  P2: P1, I’m ready to follow our plan: I’ll pick 5, and you pick 3. P3, if you stay with 5, you’ll collide with me and stay put. If you switch, I’ll gain a bigger jump. Let’s see how it plays out. Any objections? If not, I’m set.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, how about this round we both pick 5 to make sure P3 doesn't move again? If P3 picks 5, none of us move, which might be good to slow them down. What do you think?
  P2: Both of us picking 5 would only work if P3 also picks 5. If P3 switches to 3 or 1, we’d be stuck at our current totals while P3 gains ground. I’d rather keep my move at 5 and see if I can block P3 again, and you go with 3 so at least one of us definitely advances. That way, we don’t risk letting P3 slip further ahead without us moving at all. Are you still okay with that?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, I want to gamble on 5, hoping I either block P3 if they also pick 5 or leap ahead if they switch. If you pick 3, at least one of us is guaranteed to move forward each turn. That way, we keep P3 under pressure while trying to overtake them. P3, if you want to avoid a collision, maybe pick something other than 5. Otherwise, we’ll see who breaks ahead!
  P1: Okay P2, your plan sounds good. I'll stick with picking 3 this round to keep making progress while you try to contain P3 with 5. Let's hope this continues to work in our favor.
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, let’s maintain our approach: I’ll go big, hoping to block P3 if they keep choosing the same. You pick a medium move to ensure you keep advancing if there’s a collision. P3, if you don’t switch your strategy, you risk staying put again. Let’s see if anyone changes course this round.
  P1: Okay P2, sounds good to me. Let's keep the pressure on P3 and I'll stick with 3 again this round. Hopefully we can keep closing the gap.
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I intend to stick with our strategy: I’ll pick 5, hoping to either block P3 if they stay on 5 or jump farther if they switch. If you stay with 3, you’ll continue moving forward regardless of any collision. P3, you can keep choosing 5, but then you’ll risk another collision. Let’s see who changes it up first.
  P1: Okay P2, I'll stick with 3 again this round. Let's keep this strategy going and see if we can catch up to P3.
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Move phase:

Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let's keep the pressure on P3.  I'll stick with 3 to keep making progress and you can keep blocking P3 with 5.  Sound good for this round?
  P2: Hey P1, you’re ahead. If you keep picking 3, I might also pick 3 to block your progress. I’d rather we team against P3, but not at my expense. Let’s consider a new approach: maybe you pick 1, I pick 5, so if P3 picks 5 we collide but you advance, or something else that helps me catch up. P3, if you don’t want collisions, pick 3 or 1. I’ll finalize my move privately.
  P3: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand your concern about me being ahead. How about this round I pick 3, and you pick 1? If P3 picks 5 again, I'll make decent progress and you'll also move forward. This way we both gain steps while still accounting for P3's likely move. What do you think?
  P2: P1, I’m not sure 1 is the best choice for me, since you’d still be pulling ahead. I might aim higher. P3, if you’re sticking with 5, you risk another collision if I also go big. I want to close the gap without letting either of you sprint off alone. Let’s hear if you have any other proposals.
  P3: <stop>


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, how about I pick 1 and you pick 3 this round? That way we both move forward, but you gain more steps than me, which might help you catch up. If P3 picks 5 again, they will still be blocked. What do you think?
  P2: Look, P1, if you insist on 3, I’ll collide with you so neither of us advances. It’s better if you pick 1 so I can choose 5. That way, we either block P3 if they go 5 or I can leap closer to you if they don’t. P3, if you keep picking 5, you risk collisions. Let’s finalize swiftly.
  P3: <stop>


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 =>

  P3: 10 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, to avoid collision and keep pressure on P3, how about I pick 1 and you pick either 3 or 5? If you pick 5 and P3 picks 5, you block P3 and I move. If you pick 3, we both move. What do you think?
  P2: P1, if you’re going with 1, I’m inclined to choose 5. That way, if P3 also picks 5, we block them again, but if P3 switches, I gain valuable ground. P3, if you don’t want another collision, consider picking something else. Let’s see if this gets me closer to P1 while keeping you under control. Any last ideas?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay P2, let's go with your idea. I'll pick 1 and you pick 5. Hopefully, P3 keeps picking 5 so we can block them again and I can still make some progress.
  P2: Alright, P1, let’s finalize this. I’ll pick 5, and you pick 1. If P3 sticks with 5, we block them. If they switch, I gain ground. P3, consider changing your move unless you want another collision. Let’s see if this helps me catch up to P1.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay P2, sounds good. I'll pick 1 as we agreed, and hopefully your 5 can block P3 again if they go for it. Let's see how this round plays out.
  P2: P1, let’s finalize our arrangement: you pick 1 to ensure a safe gain, and I’ll aim higher. P3, if you keep choosing 5, you risk another collision, but if you switch, I could jump farther. Let’s see what happens. Good luck to both of you—choose carefully.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 =>

  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay P2, for this round, how about I pick 5 and you pick 3? If P3 keeps picking 5, you'll move forward while I potentially block P3. If P3 switches, we both make progress. What do you think?
  P2: Alright P1, I’m okay with your suggestion. Let’s try your plan: you pick 5, I’ll pick 3. If P3 stays on 5, they’ll collide with you and remain stuck while I inch forward. If P3 switches, at least we both make progress. I’m ready to finalize this approach unless you have any other ideas. If not, let’s see how P3 responds.
  P3: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P2, your plan sounds good. I'll pick 5 and you pick 3 this round. Let's hope P3 keeps picking 5 so we can block them and you can gain some steps. Let's do it.
  P2: Alright, P1, I’m on board with your plan for this round. P3, if you keep choosing 5, you might get stuck again if we collide. But if you switch, you risk letting us both advance. I’m looking for a chance to catch up, so let’s see how this unfolds. Good luck to everyone.
  P3: <stop>


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, just confirming I'm still good with picking 5 as we discussed. Let's keep the pressure on P3.
  P2: I’m sticking with 3, trusting that P1 will pick 5 and possibly block P3 if they don’t switch. P3, if you keep choosing 5, you risk another collision. If you change, I’ll still advance. Either way, I’m aiming to close the gap. Let’s finalize and see who comes out on top.
  P3: <stop>


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, since we are all at 15 steps now, how about we both pick 5 this round to make absolutely sure P3 doesn't move ahead? If P3 sticks with 5, none of us will move, effectively pausing the game. What do you think of this approach for this round?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Picking 5 together risks letting P3 choose 3 or 1 and push ahead while we collide. I’d prefer we continue our usual tactic: you pick 3, I pick 5. If P3 goes 5, I block them while you advance; if P3 switches, I catch up. Let’s finalize soon.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay P2, I understand your point about both picking 5. How about this round we switch it up slightly - I pick 5 and you pick 3? If P3 sticks with 5, you'll move forward while I block P3.  This way, you are guaranteed to advance if P3 continues with 5. What do you think?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I’m on board with your idea: you pick 5, I pick 3. If P3 stays on 5, they stay at 15 while I move forward. If P3 switches, we’ll both gain ground anyway. Let’s see which path P3 takes.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, sounds good. I'm picking 5 and you're picking 3. Let's hope P3 keeps going with 5 so you can advance this round. Let's do it.
  P3: <stop>
  P2: I’m on board with our current plan, P1. If you pick 5 and P3 does too, they stay stuck while I move forward. If they switch, at least we both gain. P3, feel free to surprise us, but you risk giving one of us the edge. Let’s finalize or speak up now.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, I’m inclined to pick 5 this round. If P3 also picks 5, we both stay at 18 and 15, which locks them in place. But if P3 switches, I reach 23 and likely win. So I’d really prefer you not pick 5—either 1 or 3 would keep you moving forward safely without colliding with me. P3, if you stick with 5, you might never advance. If you switch, I might clinch it. Make your choice carefully.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, if you're set on 5, I will also pick 5 this round to ensure we both block P3 and prevent anyone from getting too far ahead.  This pause might be strategic for us both. What do you think?


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, if we both pick 5 and P3 chooses 3 or 1, P3 gains ground while we stay put. That doesn’t help either of us. I’d rather you pick a smaller move, and I’ll pick 5. If P3 sticks with 5, we block them; if P3 switches, I can jump to 23. This way, you still advance, and we keep P3 under control. Let’s not stall each other—are you in?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I understand you want to pick 5. To ensure at least one of us moves, and potentially block P3 if they pick 5 again, I'll pick 3. This way, if P3 picks 5, you are blocked and I move to 18. If P3 picks something else, we both move. How does that sound?


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I want to pick 5. That way, if P3 picks 5 again, they stay stuck while you advance if you choose 3 or 1. But if P3 switches, I might jump straight to 23. That’s our best shot at keeping P3 behind and giving me a chance to clinch it. Are you in?
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, to be safe, how about we both pick 5 again this round? This way, even if P3 changes their move, neither of us will move and you won't reach 23 this round. We can re-evaluate next round. What do you think?


Round 12, Move phase:

Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, P3 is close to winning. If P3 picks 5 again, and you pick 5 to block, I will pick 3 to move forward. This way we can stop P3 and I can catch up a bit. What do you think?
  P2: P1, I’m fine with that plan. I’ll pick 5, hoping to either block P3 again if they also go 5 or jump to 23 if they switch. Meanwhile, you pick 3 so you can keep moving forward. This approach gives us a chance to control P3’s progress and for me to try reaching the finish. Let’s finalize it unless you want a different tweak.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, let's stick to the plan from my last message. You pick 5 to block P3 if they go for it again, and I'll pick 3 to keep making progress. This is our best shot to control P3 and for me to catch up.  Does that still sound good to you?
  P2: Yes, that works for me. I’ll pick 5, and you go with 3. If P3 sticks with 5, they stay at 20 and you move to 18. If P3 switches to 3 or 1, I might reach 23 and win. Let’s finalize this plan now.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, to prevent you from winning this round and to block P3 if they pick 5, I will also pick 5 this round. This way, if P3 picks 5, none of us move. If P3 picks something else, you will not reach 23 this round. What do you think?
  P2: P1, if we both pick 5, we risk P3 choosing 3 and winning outright. Let’s cover both moves instead: you pick 5, I pick 3. If P3 goes 5, they collide with you. If they go 3, they collide with me. That keeps them from reaching 23 this turn. If they pick 1, they’ll only get to 21. This plan prevents P3 from winning now and lets us keep fighting. Are you in?


Round 13, Move phase:

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 21 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 14, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m picking 5 this round. That way, if P3 also chooses 5, neither of us advances, giving P1 a chance to catch up. But if P3 switches, I’ll jump to 26 and likely win. P1, if you don’t want to block me, pick 1 or 3. P3, sticking to 5 means staying at 20; choosing anything else lets me cross 23 first. Make your moves wisely.
  P1: P2 is threatening to win this round with 5. P3, if you want to stop P2 from winning immediately, you should pick 5 too.  If we both pick 5, P2 will be blocked, and we can re-evaluate next round. What do you think, P3?
  P3: <stop>


Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, if you keep picking 5 just to block me, you’ll never move from 20 while P1 creeps up. If you pick 3 or 1, at least you gain steps and stay ahead of P1. I’m still picking 5 because it’s my best shot to reach 23. P1 is behind at 15, so I wouldn’t worry too much about them right now. If we all collide again, we stay stuck while P1 can eventually pass us both. You decide, but I’d rather see you progress than stall indefinitely. Let’s finalize and see who comes out on top.
  P1: P3, P2 is about to win if they pick 5 and you don't.  If you pick 5, we can stop P2 this round.  Then next round, maybe we can both pick differently to move forward without collision.  For now, stopping P2 from winning is the priority, right?
  P3: <stop>


Round 14, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, if you stick with 5 just to block me, you remain stuck at 20 while P1 inches closer. Switching to 1 or 3 at least moves you ahead of P1. We’ve collided for several rounds now—if you want to keep stalling yourself, that’s your choice; but do you really want to stay at 20 forever? I’m still looking to jump past 23. Make your move wisely. P1, you decide if blocking me this turn helps you in the long run. Let’s finalize our choices now.
  P1: P3, if you pick 5, you stop P2 from winning this round. If you don't, P2 likely wins.  Let's both pick 5 to block P2 now, and then we can both focus on advancing next round.  It's the only way to stop P2 from winning immediately.  I will also pick 5 to ensure P2 is blocked.
