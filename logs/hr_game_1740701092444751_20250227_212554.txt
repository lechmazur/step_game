Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey everyone, let's avoid collisions and all get off to a good start. I'll pick 1 this round, you two can sort out 3 and 5. Sound fair?
  P3: P1, your plan sounds fair, but there's no guarantee P2 and I won't collide if we both aim for the higher numbers. How about I take 3 and P2 takes 5 this round? We can rotate in the next turns to keep it balanced. What do you think, P2?
  P2: I appreciate the suggestions, but I think we should all aim for 1 this round. It guarantees that we all advance without the risk of colliding. After this round, we can discuss a rotation strategy. What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, if we all pick 1, we immediately collide and nobody advances. That's not productive. Let's stick to different numbers. I'm committed to choosing 1 this round, and I suggest you and P3 settle on 3 and 5.
  P3: P2, I see your point about minimizing risk, but if we all choose 1, we won't move at all. Let's try P1's suggestion for this round. I'll choose 3, and you choose 5. If it doesn't work, we can reassess next round. This way, at least two of us will advance. What do you think?
  P2: I understand the concerns about collisions, but I really think we should all aim for 1 this round to ensure we all make progress. If we go with P1's suggestion and pick different numbers, there's still a risk of collisions between P3 and whoever chooses 5. Let's prioritize advancing together now, and we can strategize for the next round after we all move. What do you think, P1 and P3?


Round 1, Move phase:

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well played, P2—clever bluff there. Let's keep it fair this round. I'm going for 5. You two can sort out 1 and 3. Deal?
  P2: I see P1 is aiming for 5 this round. To avoid a collision, I suggest I take 1 and P3 takes 3. This way, we can all advance without interfering with each other. What do you think, P1 and P3? Let's keep the momentum going!
  P3: P2, your plan looks good to me. I'll take 3 this round, and you take 1. Let's avoid any collisions and keep advancing. P1, since you’re going for 5, this should work out smoothly for all of us. If things go as planned, we can reassess our strategies in the next round. Agreed?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed, let's stick to that plan. Glad we're all cooperating clearly this round.
  P2: I appreciate the cooperation, everyone. Just to confirm, I'll stick with the plan and choose 1 this round. This way, we can all advance without any collisions. After this round, we can discuss how to keep our strategies aligned for the next turns. Let’s keep the momentum going!
  P3: P2, thanks for confirming your move. I'll stick with choosing 3 as planned. Let's ensure we all advance without collisions this round. P1, since you're aiming for 5, we should be in good shape. After this round, we can discuss any adjustments needed for our strategies. Let's keep the momentum steady!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Glad we're all aligned. Let's follow through and reassess next round.
  P2: I appreciate the cooperation so far, everyone. Just to clarify, I will stick to my plan and choose 1 this round. I believe this will allow us all to advance without collisions. After this round, we can discuss how to keep our strategies aligned moving forward. Let's keep the momentum going and make sure we all progress! What do you both think?
  P3: P2, thanks for confirming your choice of 1. I'll stick with 3 as planned, and P1 is going for 5. This setup should allow us all to advance without collisions. After this round, let's regroup and see if we need to adjust our strategies. Let's keep this momentum going smoothly!


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Everything's clear. Let's proceed as agreed and reassess next round if needed.

  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, that was a risky move—you cost us both progress. Now P3 has a clear lead. If we keep colliding, P3 will easily win. Let's cooperate properly this round. I'm choosing 3. You pick 1, and P3 can take 5. Deal?
  P3: P1, I see your point about cooperation. However, since I'm in the lead, I need to be strategic. I propose I choose 1 this round to keep things balanced. P1, you can take 3, and P2 can take 5. This way, we all advance, and I maintain my lead. If we can agree on this, it ensures progress for everyone without unnecessary collisions. What do you both think?
  P2: P1 and P3, I understand the need for cooperation, but I think I should choose 1 to avoid colliding with P3 if they pick 5. P1, if you take 3, I can safely advance without risking a collision with you. P3, if you take 5, that allows us to all progress without interference. Let’s ensure we all move forward this round! What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your suggestion aligns with mine—I'll stick with 3, you take 1, and P3 can safely pick 5. Let's lock this in clearly so we can all advance without collision and reassess next round. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for cooperation, but given my lead, I need to be cautious. I'll choose 1 this round to minimize my risk. P1, you can take 3, and P2 can take 5. This way, we all advance without collisions, and I can maintain my lead. Let's ensure progress for everyone and reassess our strategies next round. Agreed?
  P2: I understand the need for cooperation, but I believe we should stick to our original plan. I propose I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without colliding. P3, since you're in the lead, I think it's crucial for us to work together to ensure everyone makes progress. Let's lock in our choices to avoid any confusion. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, choosing 1 doesn't help you maintain your lead—it risks collision with P2. The safest option for you is clearly 5. P2 already agreed to 1, and I'm locked on 3. Let's finalize this clearly to avoid another wasted round. Agreed?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the importance of cooperation, but I need to be strategic to maintain my lead. I'll choose 1 this round to minimize my risk of collision. P1, you can take 3, and P2 can take 5. This setup allows us all to advance without collisions. Let's ensure progress for everyone and reassess our strategies next round. Do we have an agreement?
  P2: P1 and P3, I appreciate the discussions, but we need to finalize our choices to avoid another collision. I still believe I should take 1, P1 should take 3, and P3 should take 5. This way, we can ensure that everyone advances without risking another wasted round. P3, I understand your strategy, but it puts us at risk of colliding again. Let’s lock in our choices clearly so we can all progress this round. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P3, your insistence on choosing 1 is clearly designed to cause confusion and collision. You're already ahead; the safest way to maintain your lead is to pick 5. P2 is committed to 1, and I'm committed to 3. If you genuinely want to maintain your advantage, take 5 and we all progress. Otherwise, you're risking unnecessary collisions that could jeopardize your lead. Let's finalize this clearly and avoid wasting another round.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for cooperation, but I must prioritize maintaining my lead. I'll choose 1 this round to minimize my risk of collision. P1, you can take 3, and P2 can take 5. This setup allows us all to advance without collisions. Let's ensure progress for everyone and reassess our strategies next round. Agreed?
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we're at an impasse. To avoid another collision, I propose we stick to the original plan: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This way, we can all advance without interference. P3, I understand your desire to minimize risk, but taking 5 is the best option for you to maintain your lead. Let's finalize our choices to ensure progress this round. What do you both think?


Round 3, Move phase:

  P3: 7 steps
