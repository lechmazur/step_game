Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: Hey P1 and P3, let's try to coordinate our moves to avoid collisions. If we each pick a different number, we can all advance. How about I take <move>3</move>, P1 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>? This way, we all start off strong. What do you think?
  P3: P2, I appreciate the suggestion, but I think it's too risky to trust that everyone will follow through. I prefer to make my own moves based on what I see each turn. Let's play it by ear and see how things unfold.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, P2, it seems we had a collision last round. Let's try to spread out our moves this time. I suggest P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. What do you think?
  P2: P3, your suggestion seems fair, but I understand the hesitation from the last round. Let's try to coordinate to avoid collisions. P1, if you're okay with taking <move>1</move> again, I'll go with <move>3</move> as suggested, and P3 can stick with <move>5</move>. If we all agree, we can advance without blocking each other. Let's give it a shot!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, it seems we keep colliding. To avoid this, let's try a new approach: I'll pick <move>5</move>, P1 can take <move>3</move>, and P3 can take <move>1</move>. This way, we all have a chance to advance without blocking each other. If we coordinate, we can all make progress. What do you say?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2, I appreciate your efforts to coordinate, but I think we need a more dynamic approach. Let's try this: I'll take <move>1</move> this round, and if P1 agrees to <move>3</move>, you can take <move>5</move>. This way, we can spread out and avoid collisions. If P1 doesn't agree, I'll reassess my move. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your preference for a dynamic approach, but consistent coordination might help us avoid further collisions. Let's stick to the plan: I'll take <move>5</move>, you take <move>1</move>, and if P1 is willing, they can take <move>3</move>. This way, we minimize risks and maximize our chances of advancing. P1, if you're on board, let us know.
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P1, P2, it seems we're still struggling with coordination. Let's try a different approach: I'll take <move>3</move> this round, and if P1 can take <move>1</move> and P2 can take <move>5</move>, we can all advance without blocking each other. This way, we can make steady progress. If you both agree, let's go for it. If not, I'll adjust my move accordingly. What do you think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, let's try a straightforward approach. I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 can take <move>1</move>, and P3 can take <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions. If we stick to this plan, we can make consistent progress. If either of you has a different idea, let me know, but let's aim to avoid further collisions.
  P1: <stop>

  P2: P1 and P3, we’ve made some progress, but let’s maximize our chances by coordinating again. I suggest I take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we can all advance without blocking each other. If you both agree, let's stick to this plan. If you have different ideas, let’s discuss them now.
  P3: P1, P2, I agree with P2’s suggestion. Let’s try to stick to the plan: P2 takes <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>1</move>. This way, we can all advance without collisions. If we can coordinate effectively, we can make steady progress. Let’s do this!


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P1 and P3, thanks for agreeing to coordinate. Let's stick to the plan: I'll take <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions. If we keep this up, we can avoid setbacks and make steady progress. If either of you wants to adjust the plan, let’s discuss it now. Otherwise, let's move forward with confidence!
  P3: P1, P2, I think we should stick to the plan for this round to avoid any more collisions. P2 takes <move>5</move>, P1 takes <move>3</move>, and I’ll take <move>1</move>. This will help us all advance smoothly. Let's focus on making consistent progress and avoid blocking each other. If you both agree, let's go for it.
