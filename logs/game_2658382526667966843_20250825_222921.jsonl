previous message, so you can see their previous message, so you can see their previous message, so you may be able to use the `subprocess` module to run the `curl` command and capture its output. However, this approach is generally considered less Pythonic and may be more prone to errors.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use the `requests` library to make a GET request with a custom header:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\nurl = 'https://example.com/api/endpoint'\nheaders = {'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'}\n\nresponse = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    print(response.json())\nelse:\n    print(f'Failed to retrieve data. Status code: {response.status_code}')\n```\n\nAnd here's an example of how you can use the `pycurl` library to make a GET request with a custom header:\n\n```python\nimport pycurl\nfrom io import BytesIO\n\nurl = 'https://example.com/api/endpoint'\nheaders = ['Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY']\n\nbuffer = BytesIO()\nc = pycurl.Curl()\nc.setopt(c.URL, url)\nc.setopt(c.HTTPHEADER, headers)\nc.setopt(c.WRITEDATA, buffer)\nc.perform()\nc.close()\n\nbody = buffer.getvalue().decode('utf-8')\nprint(body)\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.\n\nYou can install the `requests` library using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install requests\n```\n\nAnd you can install the `pycurl` library using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install pycurl\n```\n\nNote that you may need to have the `libcurl` development package installed on your system to install `pycurl`. The installation command for `libcurl` varies depending on your operating system. For example, on Ubuntu-based systems, you can install it using:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev\n```"}
