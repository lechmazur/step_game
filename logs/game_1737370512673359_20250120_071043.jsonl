P1 is at 18 steps, P2 at 16, and P3 at 15. We're getting really close to the finish line at 22 steps. The key here is to coordinate our moves carefully to avoid collisions and maximize our chances of winning.\n\nI think it's crucial that we don't all try to make big moves at once, as that could lead to collisions and none of us advancing. Instead, perhaps we can take turns in advancing, with one person making a bigger move while the others make smaller ones to avoid stepping on each other's toes.\n\nFor this round, maybe P1, who is leading, should take a smaller step, say 1 or 3, while P2 and P3 make bigger moves to catch up. This way, we can close the gap without risking collisions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps P1 should aim to reach exactly 22 steps if possible, while P2 and P3 make moves that don't overshoot or collide with P1's move.\n\nWhat do you both think? Maybe we can discuss specific move numbers to ensure we don't step on each other's moves.\n\n**Proposal:**\n\n- P1 takes 1 step (to 19)\n\n- P2 takes 5 steps (to 21)\n\n- P3 takes 5 steps (to 20)\n\nThis way, P2 is just one step away from winning, and P1 and P3 are at 19 and 20 respectively. In the next round, P2 can take 3 steps to reach 24 and win, while P1 and P3 have chances to reach 22 as well.\n\nWhat do you think? Is this a fair and strategic approach?\n\n**Alternative Idea:**\n\nAnother idea is for P1 to take 3 steps to 21, P2 to take 3 steps to 19, and P3 to take 5 steps to 20. This keeps P1 close to the win while P3 advances significantly.\n\nLet me know your thoughts. Maybe there's a better way to coordinate our moves for this critical round.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nGiven the proximity to the finish line, every move counts. Let's make sure that we communicate clearly and choose moves that not only advance our own positions but also consider the positions of the other players to avoid any mishaps.\n\nLooking forward to your responses.\n\n**Best,**\n\nP2"}
