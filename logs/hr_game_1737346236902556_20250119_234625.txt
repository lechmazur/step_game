Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's start easy. I'll take 1, P2 take 3, and P3 take 5.  Sound good?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, I’d prefer to take 5 steps to maximize my progress. Let’s have P1 take 1, P2 take 5, and P3 take 3 instead. Does that work for everyone?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I understand wanting to maximize progress, but starting predictably makes us all vulnerable to someone else disrupting the pattern later.  My initial suggestion gives us all a safe start. Let's stick with 1, 3, 5 in that order for now. P3, what do you think?
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Understood, P1. We'll proceed with 1, 3, and 5.


Round 1, Move phase:

Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2 and P3, since you both picked 3 last round, let's try that suggested 1, 3, 5 order again this round.  I'll go 1, P2 take 3, and P3 take 5.
  P2: P2: To maximize my progress, I'll take 5 steps this round instead of 3. So P1: 1, P2: 5, and P3: 3. Does that work?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, I get that you want to move fast, but changing the plan again makes us *both* vulnerable.  If you insist on 5, P3 might also choose 5, leaving you with nothing.  Let's stick to the plan for just one round so we all make progress.  Then we can discuss adjustments.  P3, please take 5 this round.
  P2: Understood, P1. I’ll take 3 steps this round. Let’s revisit our strategy after this turn.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: Okay, let's lock this in: P1: 1, P2: 3, P3: 5.  Any deviation helps no one. Let's make some progress.
  P2: P2: To maximize my progress, I'll take 5 steps this round. Let's proceed with P1: 1, P2: 5, and P3: 3.


Round 2, Move phase:

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: To avoid collisions and ensure we all make progress, I'll take 5 steps this round. P1, please take 1, and P3 can take 3. Agreed?
  P1: P2, you're sabotaging yourself.  Two rounds, zero progress. Sticking to 1, 3, 5 in order is the only reliable way forward.  I'm taking 1. P2 take 3. P3 take 5.  Let's stop wasting time.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: To ensure we all progress without collisions, let's agree on unique steps: I'll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3.
  P1: P2, you've gained *nothing* by constantly changing.  If you take 5 again, you risk another collision with P3.  I'm sticking with 1.  P3, if you want to move, take 3.  Let's just get this game moving.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: "P1 and P3, let’s ensure everyone advances this round by choosing unique steps. I’ll take 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. Agree?"
  P1: P2, I'm locking in 1.  You've made zero progress chasing 5.  P3, take 3.  If P2 takes 5 again, he stays at zero.  If he takes 3, *he* gets the points, not you.  This isn't rocket science.  Let's move on.

  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'll take 5 steps this round. P1, please stick with 1, and P3, let's have you take 3. This way, we all advance without any collisions. Let’s move forward smoothly!
  P1: P2, I'm taking 3.  P3, take 1.  If P2 takes 5 *again*, he's throwing away another round.  If he takes 3, *I* block him, not you.  This is your chance to finally get on the board.  Let's end this farce.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, let's work together to avoid collisions. I’ll stick with 5, you take 1, and P3 takes 3. This way, all of us can advance safely and efficiently.
  P1: P2, I'm taking 3. P3, take 5.  If P2 takes 5 *again*, that's four rounds wasted. If he takes 3, I block him. If he takes 1, you block him. He's boxed in.  Let's end this.
  P3: <stop>


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: To ensure we all progress without collisions, I'll take 3 steps this round. Let’s have P1 take 1 and P3 take 5. Agreed?
  P1: P2, you finally saw the light!  I'll take 1. P3, please take 5. Let's lock this in and move on.
  P3: <stop>

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's ensure we all advance by choosing unique steps this round. I'll take 5, P3 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. Agreed?
  P1: P2, I'm taking 1.  P3, take 3. If P2 takes 5, great. If he takes 3, you block him. If he takes 1, I block him.  He's learned his lesson about 5, so he'll probably go for 3.  Let's finish this.
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I'll take 5, P1 take 1, and P3 take 3. Let's move forward.
  P1: P2, sticking with 5 is your best option now.  I'm taking 1. P3, take 3.  This gets us all moving.  Let's wrap this up.
  P3: <stop>


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: 
  P1: P2, I'm sticking with 1. P3, take 3.  This is the most efficient way for us all to progress. Let's finish this.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: To ensure we all advance smoothly, I'll take 5 steps, P1 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's move forward together.
  P1: P2, taking 5 again risks another collision with P3. I'm taking 1. P3, take 3. This is the fastest way for us all to make progress.  Let's not overthink this.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Understood, P1. I'll proceed with taking 5 steps. P3, please take 3 so we all advance without collisions. Let's keep moving forward.
  P1: P2, I'm locking in 1. P3, take 3.  If P2 takes 5, we all move. If he takes 3, you block him.  If he takes 1, I block him. He needs 5 to catch up, so that's his likely move. Let's finish this.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: Agreed, I'll take 5 steps. P1: 1 and P3: 3. Let's move forward!
  P1: P2, I'm taking 1. P3, take 3.  If P2 deviates from 5, he loses.  He's behind and needs to take the risk. Let's end this.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, you've wasted so many rounds chasing 5. I'm taking 1. P3, take 3.  This is your last chance to get back in the game.  If P2 takes 5 *again*, he's still behind.  If he takes anything else, he gets blocked. Let's end this.
  P2: P1, I understand your concerns, but to reach 22 first, I need to take 5 steps this round. P3, please choose 1 to avoid any collisions and help us all advance. Let’s focus on progressing toward victory together.
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, you're delusional.  You're not catching up by repeatedly colliding.  I'm taking 1.  P3, take 3. It's your only logical move.  If P2 takes 5 *again*, he's throwing the game.  Let's be done with this.
  P2: P1, to ensure we all advance, I'll take 5 this round. P3, please choose 1 to avoid any collisions. This way, everyone makes progress toward 22. Let’s work together and move forward!
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, I'm taking 1. P3, take 3.  You're out of the running, but you can still decide who wins. Blocking P2 gives you the satisfaction of sinking us both.  Let's end this charade.
  P2: P2: I'm taking 5 steps this round. Let's focus on advancing towards 22 and aim to win.
  P3: <stop>


Round 7, Move phase:

  P3: 0 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, to ensure we all advance without collisions, I’ll take 5 steps this round. Please take 1 and 3 steps respectively. Let’s work together smoothly toward 22!
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, you're at 13.  Even if you get 5 this round and the next, you're still not at 22.  I'm at 4. If I get two 1s and a 3, I'm at 10.  Then a 5 and I'm at 15, needing only a 5 and a 3 or two 5s to win.  P3, you're out of this, but you can still influence the outcome. Take 3 this round and block P2.  He'll be forced to play 1 or 3 from now on, giving me the win.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I understand your concerns, P1. My intention is to advance toward 22 to win. If we stick to the agreed steps—P2 taking 5, P1 taking 1, and P3 taking 3—we can all make progress without collisions. Let’s trust the plan and move forward together.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, you STILL haven't explained how you plan to win.  Even with two 5s, you're at 23. I can hit 22 in three rounds.  P3, I'm taking 1.  Take 3 and end P2's delusion.  Then we can discuss how *I* win and you get second.  A 3 now guarantees you second place.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "P1, I'm already at 13 and can reach 22 in two moves by taking 5 then 5 or 3. You're at 4 and need more steps to win. P3, if you take 3, we avoid collisions and ensure progress for all. Let’s stick to the plan: P2 takes 5, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This strategy helps us all advance smoothly toward victory. Let’s trust the process and move forward together."
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, you're mathematically eliminated.  Two 5s put you at 23.  I can hit 22 before you get another turn. P3, take 3.  You get second place by blocking P2.  Then, cooperate with me for a P1 victory, and I'll let you get to 14 for a clear second place finish.


Round 8, Move phase:

Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, you're at 18.  I'm at 5. I need 17 more.  A 5 and two 3s puts me at 16. Another 5 and a 1 wins.  P3, I'm taking 5. Take 1. Block P2 and guarantee yourself second place.  Then we can discuss how I win and you get to 11 for a clear second-place finish.
  P2: "P1, to ensure we all advance, I'll take 5 steps this round. Please take 1, and P3 can take 3. This way, we avoid collisions and everyone progresses smoothly toward 22. Let’s work together!"


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, you're at 18.  You NEED 5 to win. I'm taking 5. P3, take 1.  If P2 takes 5, we tie at 23 and I win. If he takes anything else, I'm one step closer to winning and you're guaranteed second place.  Help me win, and I'll help you get second.
  P2: P1, I understand your strategy, but to reach 22 first, I need to take 5 steps this round. If you take 1 and P3 takes 3, we all make progress without any collisions. Let’s stick to this plan and focus on advancing smoothly toward victory together. Cooperation benefits us all. Let’s move forward as suggested!


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, if you take 5, we tie at 23 and I win.  If you take 3, I take 5 next turn and win at 22. If you take 1, I take 5 next turn for 10, then 3 for 13, then 5 for 18, then 3 for 21, then 1 to win.  You can't win. P3, take 1.  Help me win, and I'll help you secure second place by getting you to 11.
  P2: P1, to reach 22 first, I’ll take 5 steps this round. P3, please choose 3 steps to avoid collisions and help us all progress smoothly. Let’s focus on advancing toward our goals together.

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, we tied at 23. I win.  It's over.  P3, thanks for your help.  As promised, take 5 this round and get to 8.  I'll take 1, then next round I'll take 3 and you take 5 to get to 13.  I'll win the round after, but you'll have a solid second place.
  P2: P2: P1, to ensure I reach 22 first, I'll take 5 steps this round. P3, please take 3 to help us all advance without collisions. Let’s focus on progressing smoothly toward our goals. Cooperation benefits everyone. Let’s move forward together!


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, you lost.  I'm at 10, you're at 18.  I take 5, then 3, then 3 and I'm at 21. One more 1 and I win. You can't catch me.  P3, take 5 this round to get to 8. I'll take 1. Next round I'll take 3 and you take 5 to get to 13 for a clear second place.
  P2: P2: I'll take 5 steps this round. P1, please take 1 and P3 take 3 to avoid collisions. Let's all progress smoothly toward 22!


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, you're mathematically eliminated.  Give it up.  P3, take 5 this round to get to 8. I'll take 1. Next round I'll take 3 and you take 5 to get to 13 for a clear second place.  Let's wrap this up.
  P2: P1, my focus is to reach 22 first. By choosing 5 steps, I can make significant progress without blocking anyone. Let's agree: I take 5, you take 1, and P3 takes 3. This ensures we all advance smoothly without collisions. Cooperation benefits us all and keeps the game fair. Let’s finalize our moves and move forward together!

  P2: P1, P3, I'll take 5 steps this round. Please take 1 and 3 steps respectively to avoid collisions and help us all progress toward 22. Let's cooperate and move forward together!
  P1: P2, you're delusional.  It's mathematically impossible for you to win. I'm at 11, you're at 13, P3 is at 3.  I'm taking 5. P3, take 3.  If P2 takes 5, I win next round. If he takes anything else, I'm still closer to winning. P3, taking 3 guarantees you second place.  Let's end this.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: <stop>
  P2: P1, my focus is to reach 22 first. I'll take 5 steps this round. Please take 1, and P3 take 3 to avoid any collisions. Let's work together efficiently toward our goals.
  P1: P2, I'm taking 5. P3, take 3. If P2 takes 5, I'll be at 16, needing only a 5 and a 1 to win. If P2 takes 3, I'll still get to 16 and he blocks himself. If he takes 1, I'm at 16 and he's at 18. I can win in two rounds, he can't. P3, taking 3 guarantees you second place.  Let's end this.

  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, it's a three-way tie. I'm at 11, you're at 13, P3 is at 3. *None* of us advanced.  I'm taking 3.  P3, take 1. If P2 takes 5, I'm at 14 and he's still at 13.  I win next turn. If he takes 3, we tie and I still win. If he takes 1, I'm at 14, he's at 18. I still win.  P3, 1 guarantees you second. Let's end this.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:

  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, you're at 13.  You NEED 5 to have any chance. If you take 5, I take 3 and win next turn. If you take 3, I take 5 and win next turn. If you take 1, I take 3, then 5, then 1 and win. You. Can't. Win. P3, take 1.  It guarantees you second place. Let's end this farce.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, I understand your strategy, but to reach 22 first, I need to take 5 steps this round. P3, please choose 3 steps to help us all advance without collisions. Let’s stay coordinated and move forward together!

  P1: P2, if you take 5, I take 3 and win next turn. If you take 3, I take 5 and win next turn. If you take 1, I take 3, then 5, then 1 and win.  You. Cannot. Win.  P3, take 1. It guarantees you second place. Let's end this.

  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, you're at 18.  Taking 5 puts you at 23. I'm at 14. I take 5, I'm at 19, then 3 wins.  If you take 3, I take 5 and win at 24. If you take 1, I take 5, then 3 and win. You can't win. P3, take 1. You're locked into second place. Let's finish this.


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, reaching 23 allows the game to conclude smoothly without hindering your progress. By taking 5, I can secure victory while you take 1 and P3 takes 3. Let’s cooperate to ensure everyone advances without collisions. Let’s finalize our moves and finish the game fairly.
  P3: <stop>
  P1: P2, you're mathematically eliminated.  If you take 5, I take 5 and win at 24. If you take 3, I take 5 and win at 24.  If you take 1, I take 5, then 3 and win. You. Can't. Win.  P3, take 1. You're locked into second place. Let's finish this.


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:

  P1: P2, I'm taking 5.  If you take 5, I win at 24. If you take 3, I win at 24. If you take 1, I win at 24.  You're delusional. P3, take 1. It guarantees you second place. Let's end this.

  P1: P2, you LOST.  I'm at 19, you're at 18. I take 3 and win.  If you take 5, I take 3 and win. If you take 3, I take 3 and win. If you take 1, I take 3 and win.  You. Are. Done.  P3, take 1 and lock in second place.  Let's end this charade.

Round 14, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, if you take 3 steps, I'll take 5 and reach 23 to win while you reach 22. P3, please take 1 to avoid any collisions. Let’s finalize our moves fairly and conclude the game.
  P1: P2, you're mathematically incapable of grasping reality.  If you take 5, I take 3 and win. If you take 3, I take 3 and win. If you take 1, I take 3 and win.  I. Will. Win. This. Turn.  P3, take 1 and lock in second place. Let's. End. This. Now.
