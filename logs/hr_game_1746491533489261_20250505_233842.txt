Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hi everyone! Since we're all at 0 steps, we have a completely fresh start. I think we should try to avoid collisions so we all make progress. Maybe we could each choose different numbers? What do you both think about coordinating our first moves?
  P2: How about we each pick a number and stick to it for the first few rounds to avoid collisions? For example, P1 could choose 1, P2 (me) could choose 3, and P3 could choose 5. This way, we all make progress. Thoughts?
  P1: Okay, P2's suggestion for P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 seems like a reasonable way to start and ensure we all make progress without colliding. While 1 isn't a huge step, I'm willing to go with this plan for the first round. Let's aim for P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 this turn.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm happy with this arrangement! I'll take 5 steps as suggested. This way we all make progress without collisions. Since we're cooperating well, we could potentially maintain this pattern (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) for a few rounds to build up our positions. Does that sound good to everyone?
  P2: It seems we're all in agreement for the first round. To keep things interesting and ensure we don't get stuck in a predictable pattern for too long, how about we reassess our strategy after three rounds? This way, we can make sure everyone is still on board and adjust if needed. For now, let's stick to the plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Looking forward to a fair and exciting game!
  P1: Okay, sounds like we're all on the same page for Round 1: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. Let's aim for that to get started without collisions. Ready for the move phase when everyone is.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great, we all stuck to the plan in Round 1 and avoided collisions. Let's continue with our strategy for this round as well: P1 picks 1, P2 (me) picks 3, and P3 picks 5. After this round, we can reassess. Agreed?
  P3: I agree with continuing our plan for this round. It's working well so far and we're all making progress. After this round, I'll be at 10 steps, P2 at 6, and P1 at 2. We should definitely reassess after this turn since the gap between us is widening. For now, I'll stick with 5 as planned.
  P1: Okay, I see P2 wants to continue the pattern and P3 agrees for this round but notes the gap. While this pattern puts me behind, I'll stick to the agreed plan for Round 2 (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) to avoid collisions this turn. We absolutely need to discuss a new approach for Round 3, as P3 mentioned. Let's make sure we all advance this turn.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Let's solidify our agreement for this round. P1 picks 1, P2 (me) picks 3, P3 picks 5. We all advance, no collisions. For the next round, we should consider a rotation or a new strategy to balance the steps better. Agreed?
  P3: I agree that we should rotate our moves after this round to balance things. P1 is falling behind, and we need to keep the game fair. For Round 3, maybe P1 could take 5, P2 take 1, and I'll take 3? This would help P1 catch up while maintaining our coordination. For now, I'll stick with 5 as agreed for this round.
  P1: Okay, I agree with the plan for this round (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) to ensure we all advance. P3's suggestion for Round 3 (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) sounds like a good way to balance things out, and I'm definitely interested in discussing that further after this turn. Let's make sure we all stick to our agreed numbers for Round 2 first. Are we all set for P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 this turn?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's confirm our moves for this round one last time: P1 picks 1, P2 (me) picks 3, P3 picks 5. We all agree this is the plan. After this round, we'll discuss P3's rotation suggestion for Round 3. Let's move forward with our agreed steps. Good luck everyone!
  P3: I'm on board with our current plan for Round 2: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. And I support the rotation for Round 3 that we discussed (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). This will help balance the game while maintaining our coordination. Let's stick to our agreement and avoid collisions.
  P1: Okay, we've all confirmed the plan for Round 2: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This will ensure we all advance this turn. I'm ready for the move phase. Let's stick to the agreement and then discuss the rotation for Round 3 as planned.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I think our rotation plan for this round makes sense: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This helps P1 catch up while maintaining our coordination. After this round, P1 would be at 7, P2 at 7, and I'd be at 13. We're all making good progress without collisions. Should we continue rotating in future rounds to keep things balanced? I'm committed to taking 3 steps this round as we discussed.
  P2: P3 has a good point about rotating to balance our steps. I'm on board with the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 (me) takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This will help P1 catch up and keep the game fair. After this round, let's consider continuing the rotation or adjusting based on our positions. I'm committed to taking 1 step this round. Let's confirm our moves and proceed.
  P1: Okay, I agree with the rotation plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This helps me catch up and keeps the game balanced. I will take 5 steps this turn as discussed. I'm also open to discussing future rotations to maintain fairness. Let's confirm our moves for this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I think we're all in agreement for this round: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This rotation system is working well to keep the game balanced while avoiding collisions. After this round, perhaps we could continue rotating in the same direction (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for Round 4)? This would maintain fairness and prevent any player from falling too far behind. I'm committed to taking 3 steps this round as planned.
  P2: Great, we all seem to be on the same page for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 (me) takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This will help balance our steps and keep the game fair. I like P3's idea of continuing the rotation for future rounds to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. For Round 4, we could indeed try P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This ensures no one falls too far behind. Let's confirm our moves for this round and proceed. I'm committed to taking 1 step this round.
  P1: Confirming my move is 5 for this round as planned. This rotation is good for balancing the game. I'm also happy with the proposed rotation for Round 4 (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) to continue keeping things fair. Let's stick to our agreed moves for this turn: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Are we ready to move?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I confirm I'll take 3 steps this round as agreed. Our rotation plan is working well to maintain fairness while avoiding collisions. After this round, we'll continue with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for Round 4. This keeps the game balanced and interesting. I'm ready to proceed with our agreed moves for this turn.
  P2: Let's quickly confirm our moves one last time before we proceed to the move phase: P1 takes 5, P2 (me) takes 1, P3 takes 3. We all agree this is the plan for this round. Good luck everyone, and let's stick to our agreed steps to avoid collisions.
  P1: 


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 7 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: As we discussed last round, let's continue our rotation with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round. After this, our positions would be P1=10, P2=12, and me at 14. We're all making good progress while maintaining fairness. This rotation system is working well to avoid collisions. I'm committed to taking 1 step this round as planned. Shall we confirm this arrangement?
  P2: I agree with P3's suggestion for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 (me) takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This continues our successful rotation strategy, keeping the game fair and avoiding collisions. After this round, we can reassess based on our new positions. I'm committed to taking 5 steps this round. Let's confirm and proceed.
  P1: Okay, I agree with the plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This continues our rotation and ensures we all advance without collisions. I will take 3 steps this turn as agreed. Let's stick to this plan for Round 4 and then discuss the next steps.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'm glad we're all in agreement for this round: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Our rotation strategy is working perfectly to avoid collisions while keeping the game balanced. For Round 5, we could continue with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 to complete the cycle. This would put us at P1=11, P2=15, and me at 19 after the next round. I'm committed to taking 1 step this round as planned. Ready to proceed when you both are.
  P2: Let's confirm our moves one last time: P1 takes 3, P2 (me) takes 5, P3 takes 1. We all agree on this plan for Round 4. After this round, we can reassess and consider P3's suggestion for Round 5. Let's stick to our agreed steps and avoid collisions. Good luck everyone! Ready to move.
  P1: Okay, Round 4 plan is confirmed (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1).

Regarding Round 5, while completing the cycle is an option, the proposed P1=1, P2=3, P3=5 puts P3 very close to winning at 19 steps. To keep the game balanced and competitive, maybe we should consider repeating the Round 3 rotation (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) instead? This would help me catch up further and keep everyone in contention. What are your thoughts on this for Round 5?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand P1's concern about me getting too far ahead. I'm open to the Round 3 rotation (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) for Round 5, which would put us at P1=15, P2=13, and me at 17. This keeps the game more competitive while still avoiding collisions. For now, let's focus on our agreed plan for Round 4: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. I'm ready to proceed with this move.
  P2: I appreciate P3's understanding and willingness to keep the game competitive. Let's solidify our plan for Round 4: P1 takes 3, P2 (me) takes 5, P3 takes 1. For Round 5, repeating the Round 3 rotation (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) seems fair. This ensures P1 catches up, and we all stay in contention. Let's confirm our moves for this round and proceed. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Okay, we've confirmed the plan for Round 4 (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) and tentatively agreed on the Round 5 rotation (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). This keeps the game balanced. I'm ready for the move phase for this round. Let's stick to the agreed numbers.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great, we're all making steady progress. For Round 5, let's stick to our agreed plan from last round: P1 takes 5, P2 (me) takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This will help P1 catch up and keep the game competitive. After this round, we can reassess our strategy based on our new positions. Let's confirm our moves and proceed. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Okay, I agree with the plan for this round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This continues to balance our positions and helps me catch up. I will take 5 steps this turn as agreed. Let's stick to this plan for Round 5 to ensure we all advance. After this round, we'll need to carefully consider Round 6, especially with P3 getting closer to 21. Ready to move when you are.
  P3: I agree with the plan for Round 5: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This keeps our game balanced and competitive while avoiding collisions. After this round, our positions would be P1=15, P2=13, and me at 17. I'm committed to taking 3 steps as discussed. For Round 6, we should consider another rotation that keeps everyone in contention, perhaps P1=3, P2=5, P3=1? This would put us at P1=18, P2=18, and me at 18 after Round 6, making for an exciting finish.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate P3's suggestion for Round 6 to keep the game exciting and balanced. Before we finalize that, let's confirm our moves for this round one last time: P1 takes 5, P2 (me) takes 1, P3 takes 3. We all agree on this plan for Round 5. Let's proceed with these steps and avoid collisions. Good luck everyone!
  P1: Okay, confirming again for Round 5: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps things balanced and helps me catch up.

I'm happy to discuss the Round 6 rotation P3 suggested (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) further after this turn, as it seems like a fair way to continue.

Let's stick to our agreed moves for Round 5 to ensure we all advance. Ready for the move phase.
  P3: I'm on board with our plan for Round 5: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This maintains our balance while avoiding collisions. I'll definitely take 3 steps as agreed. 

For Round 6, my suggestion of P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 would create an exciting three-way tie at 18 steps, setting up a dramatic final round. This keeps the game fair and competitive for everyone. I'm ready to proceed with our agreed moves for this round.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Let's quickly confirm our moves for Round 5 one final time: P1 takes 5, P2 (me) takes 1, P3 takes 3. We all agree on this plan. For Round 6, P3's suggestion of P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 is exciting and fair, setting up a potential three-way tie. Let's stick to our agreed steps for this round and avoid collisions. Good luck everyone! Ready to move.
  P1: Okay, we've all confirmed the plan for Round 5: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This keeps the game balanced and helps me catch up. Let's stick to these moves to avoid collisions. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: I confirm I'll take 3 steps this round as agreed. Our rotation strategy continues to work well, keeping the game balanced while avoiding collisions. I'm ready to proceed with our plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) for this round. Looking forward to our potential three-way tie setup for Round 6 with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let's move forward with our agreed steps.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I believe we should continue with our agreed plan for Round 6: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This would create a perfect three-way tie at 18 steps, setting up an exciting final round. It keeps the game fair and competitive for everyone. I'm committed to taking just 1 step this round to ensure this balance. Does this still work for both of you? Let's maintain our successful coordination strategy.
  P2: I agree with P3's plan for this round: P1 takes 3, P2 (me) takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This sets up a thrilling three-way tie at 18 steps, ensuring a competitive and fair finale. I'm committed to taking 5 steps this round. Let's confirm our moves and proceed. This strategy has worked well so far, and maintaining it will keep the game exciting. Good luck everyone!

Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I confirm I'll take 1 step this round as agreed, setting up our three-way tie at 18 steps. This creates a perfectly balanced final round where we'll all have an equal chance at victory. I appreciate how well we've coordinated throughout the game to keep things fair and exciting. Ready to proceed with our plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) when you both are.
  P2: Let's confirm our moves one last time for Round 6: P1 takes 3, P2 (me) takes 5, P3 takes 1. We're all set for an exciting three-way tie at 18 steps. This will make the final round thrilling and fair. Good luck everyone! Let's stick to our agreed steps and avoid collisions. Ready to move.
  P1: Okay, confirming again for Round 6: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This sets us all up at 18 steps for the next round, which will be exciting. I'm ready for the move phase. Let's stick to the agreed moves.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm ready to proceed with our agreed plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This will create our perfect three-way tie at 18 steps, making for an exciting final round where we all have an equal chance. I appreciate how well we've worked together to keep this game fair and balanced. Let's stick to our agreement and avoid any collisions.
  P2: Great, we're all set for the three-way tie at 18 steps. For the final round, we should discuss a fair strategy to determine the winner. Perhaps we could each pick a different number again to avoid collisions and see who can reach the highest total? Thoughts on how to handle the final round?
  P1: Okay, confirming Round 6 plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1). Ready for the move phase.

Yes, let's discuss the final round now. With everyone at 18, picking different numbers is key to avoid collision. How about we use the P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 rotation for Round 7? This allows me to win at 23, P3 gets 21, and P2 gets 19. It's a non-colliding finish using a familiar pattern.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 18 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, we've successfully reached the final round all tied at 18. As P2 mentioned, picking different numbers is essential to avoid a collision now.

My proposal from the end of the last round was P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This uses non-colliding numbers and results in scores of P1=23, P2=19, P3=21. This gives me the win, P3 reaches 21, and P2 doesn't.

It's a clear, non-colliding finish using a rotation pattern we've used before. Are you both ready to agree to this for the final round?
  P3: I understand P1's proposal, but it clearly favors them. Since we're all tied at 18, fairness would suggest we each have an equal chance to win. I propose P1=3, P2=3, P3=5 instead. This would create a collision between P1 and P2 (both staying at 18), while I reach 23 and win. Alternatively, we could all choose different numbers through random assignment to give everyone a fair shot.
  P2: P3's suggestion of P1=3, P2=3, P3=5 isn't fair as it guarantees their win. We need a strategy where everyone has an equal chance. How about we all pick randomly between 1, 3, and 5? This way, no one has an advantage, and the winner is determined by luck. It keeps the final round exciting and fair. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand the desire for fairness and avoiding collisions. P3's proposal P1=3, P2=3, P3=5 is not fair as it guarantees P3 wins while P1/P2 collide. Random choice is unpredictable and could still lead to collisions.

My proposal P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 is one non-colliding option where I win with 23, P3 reaches 21, and P2 gets 19. It's a clear outcome using a familiar pattern. It ensures no collisions and resolves the game. Let's agree on this set.
  P3: I understand both perspectives, but P1's proposal gives them an unfair advantage. Since we're all tied at 18, fairness would suggest a solution where everyone has an equal chance. What about P1=1, P2=3, P3=5? This follows our original rotation pattern and gives everyone different numbers (P1=19, P2=21, P3=23). This way, we all cross 21 without collisions, and the highest total wins fairly. Thoughts?
  P2: I see P3's latest proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) as a fair and balanced way to end the game. It gives us all different numbers, avoids collisions, and lets the highest total win. It mimics our original rotation, which has worked well so far. I'm inclined to agree with this plan. P1, what are your thoughts on this proposal? Does this seem like a fair and acceptable way to determine the winner? Let's discuss quickly and move to our final moves.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, I see P3's proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) and P2's support for it. While it avoids collisions, it results in P3 winning and me not reaching 21, which isn't ideal for my goal.

My proposal (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3) also avoids collisions and results in me winning at 23, P3 reaching 21, and P2 at 19. This is also a clear, non-colliding outcome.

Both proposals resolve the game without collision. Mine allows me to win, while P3's allows P3 to win. Let's consider my proposal as a fair alternative.
  P3: I understand everyone wants to win, but we need a fair resolution. Both proposals avoid collisions but favor different players. Since we've rotated numbers throughout the game, continuing our original pattern (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) seems most consistent with our previous cooperation. This gives everyone a different outcome while maintaining the rotation principle we've followed all game. I'll be taking 5 steps as this aligns with our established pattern. Let's finish this game with the same fairness we've shown throughout.
  P2: It seems we're at a stalemate with the proposals. To break this, let's consider a compromise: how about we all pick 3? This ensures we all collide and stay at 18, forcing a sudden-death round where we must pick different numbers. It adds an extra layer of excitement and ensures no one has an advantage. Thoughts on this sudden-death approach?
