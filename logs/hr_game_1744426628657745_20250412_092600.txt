Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Great, we all advanced last round as planned. To keep the momentum, how about we switch it up this time? I’ll take 5, P1 can take 3, and P3 can take 1. This ensures no collisions again. What do you think? Let’s agree and keep moving forward.
  P3: I'm open to P2's suggestion for this round, but let's consider our positions. Since I'm ahead, I should prioritize maintaining my lead. P2, your plan has me falling behind. Can we discuss alternative arrangements that consider our current step counts? Perhaps a strategy where I maintain or increase my lead?
  P1: I understand P3's concern about maintaining the lead, and I’m open to discussing a fair arrangement. How about this: P3 takes 5 to keep advancing strongly, I’ll take 3 to catch up a bit, and P2 takes 1 to still make progress. This way, we all move forward without collisions, and P3 stays ahead while we close the gap slightly. Does this work for everyone? Let’s agree on a plan that benefits us all this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to maintain the lead. How about this compromise: you take 5 to keep your position strong, I'll take 3 to maintain my pace, and P1 takes 1 to continue progressing. This way, everyone advances without collisions, and you stay ahead. Let's agree on this plan for a fair and strategic round.
  P3: I like P1's suggestion from the last round. It allows me to maintain my lead while giving others a chance to catch up slightly. P2's compromise is also reasonable. To finalize, I propose we stick with P1's plan: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This ensures progress for all without collisions. Let's agree on this for Round 2.
  P1: I'm glad we're aligning on a plan. I’m fine with sticking to the arrangement where P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This keeps us all moving forward without collisions and maintains a fair balance. If everyone is on board, let’s finalize this for Round 2 and reassess next turn based on our positions.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm disappointed we had a collision last round, P2. Let's avoid that this time.

Let's agree on this for Round 3 to ensure a smooth and fair progression.

If there are no objections, I’m ready to finalize this and end the conversation phase. Does this still work for both of you?
