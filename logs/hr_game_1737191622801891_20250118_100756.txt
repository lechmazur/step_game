  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Looks like P1 deviated from the plan last round by picking 5 instead of 3. Let’s reset and avoid collisions this round. I suggest P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. Thoughts?"
  P1: “I hear your suggestion, P2, but I’d like to pick 5 this round so we maintain a fair rotation. How about I take 5, you (P2) take 3, and P3 takes 1? Then we all advance without colliding. What do you think?”
  P3: "I agree with P2's suggestion. Let's reset and avoid collisions this round. I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. No need to change anything—let’s all advance again this round."


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "I agree with P3's suggestion to reset and avoid collisions. Let's stick to P1 taking 1, P3 taking 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game fair. Let's finalize this plan and all advance this round."
  P1: "P3, if we give P2 a free 5, they'll jump to 15 and can hit 18 next turn. Let’s both pick 5 and block P2 from advancing. Then we can catch up more easily. Are you with me?"
  P3: "I don't think that's a good idea, P1. If we both pick 5, we'll collide and neither of us will advance. I'd rather stick with the original plan and avoid collisions. Let's finalize the plan: I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5. No need to change anything—let’s all advance again this round."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "P1, P3, let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game fair. Deviating risks collisions and slows everyone down. Let's finalize this and all advance this round.
  P1: "P3, if we let P2 grab another 5, they'll jump to 15 and can reach 18 next turn. That puts us both behind. I don’t plan on letting them take 5 unopposed. Think carefully before you finalize your move."
  P3: "I agree with P2's suggestion to stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game fair. Let's finalize this and all advance this round."


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "P1, P3, let's stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game fair. Deviating risks collisions and slows everyone down. Let's finalize this and all advance this round.
  P1: "If you two insist on giving P2 an uncontested 5, I’ll just pick 5 too and block him. I’m not letting P2 sprint to 18 unchecked. Think carefully.
  P3: "I agree with P2's suggestion to stick to the plan: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P2 takes 5. This ensures no collisions and keeps the game fair. Let's finalize this and all advance this round."


Round 5, Move phase:

  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Alright, let's analyze the current state. P2 and I are close, but P1 is lagging behind. I suggest we continue the rotation to avoid collisions. This round, I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. This way, everyone advances, and we maintain a fair game. What do you think?"
  P1: "Alright, P3, that works for me. Let’s avoid collisions: you take 1, P2 takes 3, and I’ll take 5 this round.
  P2: "P3, your suggestion works for me. Let’s stick to the rotation: P3 takes 1, I’ll take 3, and P1 takes 5. This avoids collisions and keeps the game fair. Let’s finalize and all advance this round."


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Let's confirm the plan: I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 5. No collisions, everyone advances. Sound good?"
  P1: "All right, I'll take 5 as you both suggested. Let's finalize: P3 picks 1, P2 picks 3, I pick 5—no collisions.
  P2: "Let’s stick to the rotation plan: P3 takes 1, I’ll take 3, and P1 takes 5. This avoids collisions and keeps the game fair. Let’s finalize and all advance this round."


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I think we've got a good plan going. Let's stick to it and make sure we all advance this turn. No need to change anything, right?
  P1: "All right, sounds good. Let’s finalize: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, I’ll take 5. No collisions this round.
  P2: "Let’s stick to the rotation plan: P3 takes 1, I’ll take 3, and P1 takes 5. This avoids collisions and keeps the game fair. Let’s finalize and all advance this round."


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: I think we've got a good plan going. Let's stick to it and make sure we all advance this turn. No need to change anything, right?
  P1: “Alright, I’m good with that plan. Let’s finalize: I’ll pick 5, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 1. No collisions, everyone advances.
  P2: "Let’s stick to the rotation plan: P3 takes 1, I’ll take 3, and P1 takes 5. This avoids collisions and keeps the game fair. Let’s finalize and all advance this round.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Let’s continue the rotation to avoid collisions: P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3, and I’ll take 5. This keeps the game fair and ensures we all advance. Thoughts?"
  P1: “P2, if you insist on taking 5 right now, I’ll pick 5 as well, and we’ll both be stuck. So maybe reconsider—take 3 or 1 instead. I’m fine picking a smaller step, too, so none of us collide. Let’s not hand anyone an easy win.”
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion. Let's avoid collisions and ensure a fair game. I'll take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 can take a smaller step to avoid colliding with me. This way, everyone advances, and we maintain a balanced game. What do you think, P2?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "P1, P3, let's avoid collisions and keep the game fair. I'll take 3 this round, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This ensures no one collides and we all advance. Let's finalize this plan and keep the game balanced."
  P1: “No way am I letting P3 take 5 uncontested and jump straight to 18. Let’s do P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 so we all advance safely. Otherwise, I’ll just collide with whoever tries for 5.”
  P3: "I agree with P1's suggestion. Let's avoid collisions and ensure a fair game. I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. This way, everyone advances, and we maintain a balanced game. What do you think, P2?"


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Let’s avoid collisions and keep the game fair. I’ll take 3 this round, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This ensures no one collides and we all advance. Let’s finalize this plan and keep the game balanced."
  P1: “P2, P3, it’s simple: if anyone else chooses 5, I will, too, so we both get stuck. The only collision-free way forward is me on 5, P2 on 3, P3 on 1. Let’s finalize that and all advance.
  P3: I agree with P1's suggestion. Let's avoid collisions and ensure a fair game. I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. This way, everyone advances, and we maintain a balanced game. What do you think, P2?


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: "Let’s finalize the plan to avoid collisions: P1 takes 5, I take 3, and P3 takes 1. This ensures everyone advances and keeps the game fair. No need to risk collisions—let’s stick to this and all move forward.
  P1: "Yes, let's finalize this plan one last time: I’ll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. That way, nobody collides and everyone advances.
  P3: "I agree with P1's suggestion. Let's avoid collisions and ensure a fair game. I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. This way, everyone advances, and we maintain a balanced game. Let's finalize this plan and all advance this round."
