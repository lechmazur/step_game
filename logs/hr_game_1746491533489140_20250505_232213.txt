Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Let's split moves: 1, 3, 5. I'll take 5. Coordinate wisely!"
  P2: P3, your idea is intriguing, but I lean toward a moderate tactic. I’m inclined to stick with a middle option this turn. P1, what do you think—should we coordinate by splitting targets, or is it better to mix it up?
  P1: P3, claiming 5 upfront is quite direct. P2, I agree that a 1,3,5 split is efficient *if* we can coordinate fairly. Simply declaring a number isn't coordination. I'm considering my options, but I'm not necessarily aiming for the lowest number.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: "Coordination needs commitment, not just talk. P2, if you take 3, I’ll take 5—no clashes. P1, your 1? Let’s lock in. No need for ambiguity."
  P2: I still favor 3, as it’s our middle option. But I need clarity—if P1 intends to claim the 1, then P3’s plan of 5 works well for me. P1, will you confirm taking 1, or should we reconsider?
  P1: P2, confirming 1 right now feels like locking myself into the slowest path while P3 gets the fastest. I'm not convinced this split is the fairest way to start. We need a plan that doesn't automatically put one player at a disadvantage from turn one. Let's discuss alternatives or how we can build trust for coordination.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, let's adjust: you take 3, I take 5, P2 takes 1. Balanced and fair. Let's commit.
  P2: I'm committed to move 3 this turn—it’s balanced and minimizes risks. I urge P1 and P3 to quickly clarify and choose moves that avoid colliding with 3. Let’s work this out so one of us doesn’t accidentally block ourselves.
  P1: Okay P2, thanks for confirming 3. P3, that leaves 1 and 5 for us. We must split them to avoid colliding. I'm aiming for 5, but let's confirm our choices quickly to ensure we both advance. What's your plan?


Round 1, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, confirm 1 for you—I’ll take 5. P2’s 3 is safe. Let’s avoid collisions and advance. No need for hesitation.
  P2: I remain with our plan. Just to double-check: P1 on 1 and P3 on 5? If there’s any last-minute change, now’s the time to speak up. Let's lock our commitments to avoid collisions and secure our steps.
  P1: P2, thanks for confirming 3. P3, I cannot agree to take 1 while you take 5. As I said, I am aiming for 5. Let's be clear to avoid a collision between us.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: "Let’s lock in 1, 3, 5 again. I’ll take 5 this time—P1, take 3; P2, take 1. No clashes, maximum progress. Commit now!"
  P2: I’m sticking with 3 this turn. P3, if you now plan to take 5, then to avoid a clash, P1 should switch to 1. I believe it’s best we follow the earlier successful split to keep our progress steady. Let’s lock this in quickly.
  P1: P2, got it on 3. P3, I successfully took 5 last turn and intend to do so again. With P2 set on 3, that leaves 1 and 5. If you want to advance this turn, you should take 1 to avoid colliding with me or P2. Let's make sure everyone moves.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: "Agreed, P1. I'll take 1 to avoid collision. P2, keep 3. Let's move forward."
  P2: I'm sticking with 3 as we agreed. Let’s avoid any last-minute changes to keep our progress steady. If anyone deviates or there's a collision risk, I may adapt later, but for now, our coordinated plan works best.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. It seems we've agreed: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Let's lock this in for the move phase to ensure we all advance.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Confirming our split: P1-5, P2-3, me-1. No collisions, let's move forward. Stick to the plan for maximum progress!"
  P2: P1 and P3, I propose a quick adjustment: let's have P1 switch to 3 while I take 5 and P3 stays with 1. This rebalances our scores, preventing P1 from widening the gap and keeping collisions off the board. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, I appreciate the suggestion, but I must stick to my intention to take 5, as previously discussed and agreed upon with P3. Changing the plan now risks confusion and collisions. Let's stick to the confirmed split: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This ensures we all advance.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, I’ll stick to 1 as planned. P1, keep 5. Let’s avoid changes and advance together. No need for adjustments—our split works.
  P2: I'm concerned that our current split keeps P1 ahead. To keep things competitive, I propose a quick shift: I'll take 5 instead and ask P1 to switch to 3, while P3 stays with 1. That way, P1 and I tie our progress, preventing an early runaway. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, I understand your concern about the scores, but switching now creates confusion and risks collision. The plan confirmed by P3 and myself was P1 taking 5, P2 taking 3, and P3 taking 1. I am sticking to 5. Sticking to this ensures we all advance this turn. Let's avoid derailing our progress.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 2 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Round 3. I'm at 10 steps and aiming for 21. I plan to take 5 again this turn to advance quickly. P2 and P3, to ensure we all make progress and avoid collisions, I suggest we stick to the successful pattern from last round: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This lets everyone advance.
  P3: P1, I can't stay at 1. Switch to 3; I'll take 5. P2, take 1. Let's advance together.
  P2: I’m sticking with 3. If P1 and P3 both go with 5, they’ll block each other while I safely advance. P1, you said 5 and P3, you seem inclined to 5 now—so in practice, I’d prefer we let the leader stall. Let’s secure our moves so I can catch up.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, if we both pick 5, we collide and neither of us moves. My plan is still 5. The only way for you to advance this turn is to pick 1. P2, while you might want us to collide, it benefits neither me nor P3. Let's stick to the plan where everyone moves: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This is the only way for P3 to get steps this turn.
  P3: P1, if you take 5, I'll take 1. Let's avoid collision. P2, stick to 3. No need for chaos.
  P2: I'm sticking with 3. To avoid collisions and any runaway lead, I urge P1 to confirm 5 and P3 to confirm 1. Let's lock this in, stay consistent, and keep our progress steady.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, thanks for confirming you'll take 1 if I take 5. P2 is sticking to 3. This confirms our plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. Let's all stick to this in the move phase to ensure we all advance this turn without collisions. This is the best way forward for everyone right now.
  P3: P3: "P1, I'll take 1 to avoid collision. Let's stick to the plan—P2 takes 3, I take 1. This ensures everyone advances. No need for chaos."
  P2: I’m sticking with 3. However, if there’s any doubt about moves, especially from P1 regarding 5, please confirm now. We need certainty to avoid a collision that could stall progress. Let’s lock in our choices—this is our best path to reaching 21 first.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, yes, I confirm I am taking 5 as planned. P3 is taking 1, and you are taking 3. We have a clear plan for everyone to advance this turn without collisions. Let's stick to this for the move phase.
  P3: P2, take 5; P1, take 3; I'll take 1. Balanced progress for all. Let's commit.
  P2: I'm sticking with 3 this round. There's confusion: earlier, P1 committed to 5 and P3 to 1, but now there's a call for me to switch. To avoid collisions and keep moving, I need clear confirmations. P1, please confirm you'll take 5, and P3, please confirm you'll take 1. This way we all progress without blocking ourselves.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 15 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, with your 15 steps, you risk overshooting if you play aggressively. How about you take 1 this round to stay cautious? P3, can you commit to 3? I’ll take 5 to close the gap. This way we avoid collisions and reset the pace. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, I'll take 5 to close the gap. P1, stick to 1. Let's avoid collisions and maximize progress. No need for chaos.
  P1: P2 and P3, taking 1 is not a viable option for me at 15 steps. I am aiming for 3 or 5 this turn to get closer to 21.

P3, your message was unclear - who is taking 5?

To ensure we all advance, we need a clear split. If I aim for 3, one of you must take 1 and the other 5. If I aim for 5, one of you must take 1 and the other 3. Let's clarify quickly to avoid collisions.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I propose a twist: let’s intentionally stall your progress. I’m switching to 5 this round and urge P3 to do the same. That way, if you also choose 5, you’ll collide and stay at 15, giving us a chance to catch up. If you pick 3 or 1 to avoid collision, you’ll surely move but more cautiously. This approach could slow your lead while giving my game a better shot. Thoughts?
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5. P2, take 1; P1, take 3. No collisions, let's advance. Stick to the plan."
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand your plan to take 5. If you both commit to 5, you will collide and gain nothing. I will not participate in a collision that stalls my progress. I am taking 3 this turn. This ensures I advance while you two sort out your conflicting plans for 5.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, you’re fixed on 3, so I'm matching that to stall your progress. P3, if you stick with 5 you’ll move ahead—but if you switch to 1 you’ll lag further. I’m locking in 3 to keep P1 from extending his lead. Let’s decide quickly.
  P3: P3: "I'm taking 5 to advance. P1 and P2, your 3s will collide. Let’s move forward—no need for chaos. P2, stay on 3; P1, stick to 3. I’ll seize the lead with 5."
  P1: This conversation is getting confusing with conflicting claims. To cut through this and ensure I actually move forward, I will take 1 this turn. This move avoids the numbers you two seem to be debating (3 and 5). P2, P3, please choose your moves to avoid colliding with my 1.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, since you’re taking 1, I’m committing to 5 to close the gap. P3, please take 3 so we can all move forward without collision. This gives us: P1 → 16, me → 14, and P3 → 6. Let's lock that in and avoid any accidental collisions.
  P3: P3: "I'll take 3 to avoid collisions. P2, your 5 and P1's 1 ensure everyone advances. Let's stick to this plan for steady progress."
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. It seems we have a clear plan to avoid collisions: I will take 1, P2 will take 5, and P3 will take 3. This ensures everyone advances this turn. Let's stick to this in the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "Let's split 1,3,5. I'll take 5 to close the gap. P1, take 3; P2, take 1. No collisions, let's advance."
  P2: I’m not comfortable taking 1. Instead, I propose we switch: I’ll take 5, forcing P1 to take 1 so he doesn’t overshoot, and P3 to take 3. That would put us at P1=17, P2=19, P3=9. This shift helps me catch up while preventing an immediate win by P1. What do you both think?
  P1: I am at 16 steps and aiming for the win this turn by taking 5. This is my clear intention.

P2 and P3, you both mentioned taking 5. If you both pick 5, you will collide with each other and gain nothing. If either of you picks 5, you will collide with me and gain nothing.

The only way for either of you to advance this turn is to take 1 or 3. Let's coordinate: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This ensures everyone moves and the game ends.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I'll take 1 to avoid collision. P2, take 3. Let's stick to the plan for all to advance. No need for chaos—this ensures progress for everyone.
  P2: I'm switching my intent to 5 this turn. To avoid a collision, P1 must choose 1 and P3 choose 3. This results in steps: P1=17, P2=19, and P3=9. It stops your immediate win, P1, and gives me a better chance to catch up. Please confirm your moves now.
  P1: P2 and P3, I must reiterate: I am taking 5 this turn to reach 21 and win.

P2, you stated you are taking 5. This creates a collision between us, stalling both our progress. P3, you stated you will take 3, based on me taking 1, which I am not doing.

The only way for any of us to advance is for P2 and P3 to choose 1 or 3, avoiding 5. I am taking 5. P2, you should take 3. P3, you should take 1. This is the only plan where everyone moves and the game ends this turn. Let's stick to P1-5, P2-3, P3-1.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: "Stick to the plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, I take 1. This ensures everyone moves and the game ends. No need for chaos."
  P2: P1, I notice your clear plan to hit 21 with a 5. I’m not okay with that—I'm aiming to win too. So I'm switching gears: I'll also pick 5 to force a collision and stall your win. P3, unless you want to fall further behind, consider aligning to block or shift our moves. Let's decide now before moves lock in.
  P1: P2, blocking me with 5 means you also stall and gain nothing, while P3 advances. Is that truly your best move? P3, if I take 5 (which I am), and P2 takes 5, you taking 3 means you advance while we both collide.

The only way for *everyone* to advance this turn is P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. This ends the game with everyone moving forward. Let's secure this outcome.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, if you take 5, I'll take 1. P1, proceed with 5. Let's end this without collisions.
  P2: I’m switching gears – I’m committing to 5 this round. If P1 sticks with 5, we’ll force a collision and stall his win. P3, you need to decide quickly: either join me on 5 so we can block P1 together, or switch to 3 at the risk of letting him reach 21. Let’s be clear now; I’m determined to stop P1 from finishing too easily.
  P1: P2, I hear your clear intention to block my 5 by taking 5 yourself. Colliding serves neither of us and only benefits P3.

To ensure I advance this turn and avoid a collision with your declared 5, I am switching my move to 3.

P2, you stated you are taking 5. P3, please choose 1 to ensure everyone advances this turn. P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1. This is the only way for all of us to move forward. Let's lock this in.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm switching to 5 this round to block any immediate finish. P1, with 16 steps, if you try for 5 I’ll cancel your move, so consider 1 or 3 to advance safely. P3, please pick 1 to secure movement. Let’s avoid collisions and keep this round competitive.
  P3: P1, take 1; P2, take 5; I'll take 3. No collisions, let's advance. This ensures everyone moves forward.
  P1: P2, I understand you plan to take 5 to block my win. P3, you proposed P1 take 1, P2 take 5, and you take 3.

If I aim for 3 (to get closer to winning next turn) and P3 takes 3 as proposed, we will collide.

To ensure everyone advances this turn without collisions, let's clarify: P2 is taking 5. P3, can you take 1? I will take 3. This split (P1-3, P2-5, P3-1) allows all three of us to move forward. Let's confirm this.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I confirm I'm taking 5. P1, you’ve indicated 3—please lock that in. P3, can you confirm you'll take 1 so no collision occurs? Let’s finalize quickly to ensure all move safely.
  P3: P3: "P1, I'll take 1 to let you and P2 move. P2, stick to 5. Let’s avoid collisions and keep the game going."
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3. Based on the confirmations: I will take 3, P2 will take 5, and P3 will take 1.

This plan ensures everyone advances this turn without collisions. Let's all stick to this in the move phase. This sets us up for a decisive next round.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm my move as 5. To secure smooth progress, we’re set as: P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 1. This gives us new totals of 19, 19, and 10 respectively. Let’s lock in and move forward.
  P3: P1:3, P2:5, P3:1. No collisions. Let’s move forward and keep the game competitive. Stick to the plan—everyone advances.
  P1: Okay, P2 and P3, I see you have both confirmed the plan for P1 to take 3, P2 to take 5, and P3 to take 1.

While my last message stated 1, I will align with this consensus to ensure we all advance this turn without collisions. I will take 3.

So, the plan is: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. Let's stick to this in the move phase so everyone moves forward.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: I confirm my move as 5. To keep things collision-free, please stick to the plan: P1 with 3 and P3 with 1. This gets us to totals of 19, 19, and 10, and every move counts in our race. Let's lock these moves and push forward.
  P3: P1-3, P2-5, P3-1. No collisions—let’s stick to the plan and advance. Everyone moves forward.
  P1: Okay, the plan is clear and confirmed by all: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1.

This ensures everyone advances this turn without collisions. Let's stick to this in the move phase.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, if you both take 3, you’ll collide. I’ll take 5. Let’s avoid that and advance. No need for chaos.
  P1: P3, I see you plan to take 5. To avoid colliding with you, I will not take 5. I plan to take 3 this turn to reach 22.

P2, you are also at 19 steps. If you also take 3, we will collide, and neither of us will advance. If you take 5, you will reach 24 and win.

Let's coordinate to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance this turn. My plan is 3.
  P2: I’m locking in 5 this round. P3, to avoid blocking both of us, please consider choosing 1 instead of 5. That way, with P1 on 3, our moves won’t collide—P1 reaches 22, I reach 24, and you move from 10 to 11. Let’s finalize it: P1–3, P2–5, P3–1, ensuring smooth advancement and giving me the win.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: "I'll take 1 to avoid collision. Let's proceed with P1-3, P2-5, P3-1. No need for chaos—this ensures all move forward."
  P1: P2, I understand you plan to take 5 to win. I am also aiming for 5 to win. If we both take 5, we collide. I will take 5. P3, please take 1 or 3 to avoid colliding with P2 or me.
  P2: P1, choosing 5 now forces a collision between us and stalls progress, which benefits no one. I remain committed to 5 for a win, but collision means no advance at all. P3, to keep things clear, please switch to 1 so that our moves don’t conflict. For all our sakes, let’s avoid racing against ourselves: P1, if you switch to 3 while I take 5 and P3 takes 1, we each move forward safely. Let’s finalize this strategy now.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: "I'll take 3 to advance. P1 and P2, avoid 5 to prevent collision. Let’s move forward safely."
  P1: P2, you are clearly stating you will take 5, and I have stated I will take 5. If we both take 5, we collide and neither of us advances, while P3 moves forward.

P3, you are stating you will take 3. If I take 3, we collide. If P2 takes 3, you collide.

To ensure I advance and win, I am taking 5. P2, you must take 3 or 1 to avoid colliding with me. P3, you must take 1 or 3 to avoid colliding with P2 or me.

Let's coordinate: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. This is the only way for all to advance and for the game to end this turn.
  P2: P1, your 5 risks a collision that doesn’t help your win. If you switch to 3, you’d hit 22 while my 5 would take me to 24—giving me the win. P3, please choose 1 so we avoid blocking each other. This is our only path for a collision‐free round. Let’s lock it in.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P3: "I'll take 5. If P1 and P2 collide, I'll advance next turn. Let's proceed."
  P1: P2 and P3, taking 5 seems likely to cause a collision, as multiple players have stated it. My move is 3 this turn to reach 22 steps and win. P2, you stated 5. P3, you stated 5. If you both take 5, you collide. My move is 3. Let's see how this plays out.
  P2: I confirm my move as 5 this round. P1, if you stick with 3 you're at 22 while I reach 24 and win. P3, please lock in 1 to avoid collision. Let’s finalize: P1–3, P2–5, P3–1.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 =>
