Game settings: end_position=19, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's think strategically here. We all start at 0, and collisions mean no one advances. If we all pick different numbers, we each get to move. But coordination is risky - someone could betray. 

I suggest we establish a rotation: Round 1 (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5), Round 2 (P1:3, P2:5, P3:1), Round 3 (P1:5, P2:1, P3:3). This way we all reach 9 after 3 rounds fairly.

Of course, I can't guarantee I'll follow this - and neither can you. But it's a starting point for discussion. Thoughts?
  P3: To avoid collisions and ensure progress, I agree that a coordinated strategy is beneficial. However, P1's proposed rotation, while fair, assumes cooperation. I'm concerned that someone might deviate for personal gain. Let's simplify: if we all choose different numbers this round, we all advance. I suggest P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we establish trust and make progress. If you're both willing, let's confirm our moves now or discuss further.
  P2: "Agreed. I'll take 3 this round as proposed. Let's confirm our numbers and avoid collisions. Trust is key to mutual progress. "


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Error: Connection error.
  P3: Since P1 had a connection error, let's confirm our understanding. P2 has agreed to take 3, and I've agreed to take 5. If P1 is willing to take 1 as suggested, we can all advance this round. To confirm, I'll reiterate: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I take 5. If you're ready, P2, please respond to confirm we've got an understanding that works for everyone when P1 returns.
  P2: "I'll take 3. P3 takes 5. P1, please take 1. Let's avoid collisions and advance fairly."


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I appreciate the coordination attempt. I'll take 1 this round as suggested - P2 takes 3, P3 takes 5. 

However, I want to be transparent: after this round, I'm not committing to any fixed rotation. The game rewards reaching 19 first, not fairness. We should each play strategically based on the evolving positions.

Let's proceed with this plan for Round 1 only.
  P3: Since we've agreed on the numbers for Round 1 (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5), let's focus on Round 2. To maintain progress, I suggest we stick to a similar pattern, but with a different order. For Round 2, how about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1? This continues the rotation and ensures we all advance if everyone cooperates. P1 mentioned being strategic; let's discuss how to balance cooperation with individual gain. P2, your thoughts on this proposal for Round 2?
  P2: "Agreed. For Round 2, I’ll take 5 as proposed to keep the rotation fair. Let’s lock in Round 1 first—P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5, and I stick to 3. After Round 1, we’ll reassess based on positions. Cooperation helps us all, but I’ll always prioritize winning. "


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: For Round 2, I still think our proposed rotation is a good starting point: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and I take 1. This maintains the pattern and ensures we all advance if everyone cooperates. However, considering P1's emphasis on being strategic, let's be prepared to adjust. If someone deviates, we should be ready to respond. P2, are you committed to the rotation for Round 2, or do you think we should start thinking about a more competitive strategy?
  P2: "Confirmed. Round 2: I’ll take 5 as proposed. Let’s execute this round cleanly. Once we hit Round 3, expect sharper play from me—I’ll adapt based on positions to maximize my path to 19. For now, stay coordinated."
  P1: I'll stick with the rotation for Round 2 and take 3 as discussed. P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1.

But let me be clear - after this round, we'll be at P1:4, P2:8, P3:6. P2 will be halfway to victory. Round 3 onwards, I'm playing to win, not to maintain fairness. The leader becomes the target.

Everyone should think carefully about their Round 3 strategy. The cooperation phase is nearly over.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: For Round 2, I'm taking 1 as agreed. Let's focus on Round 3. Given P2's lead, I'll likely take 5 to maximize my gain. P1, you're at a disadvantage; taking 5 in Round 3 would put you ahead of me. P2, be cautious: if you take 1 or 3, a collision is likely. Consider taking 5 in Round 3 to avoid being blocked by both of us. Let's be prepared to adapt and potentially disrupt each other's plans.
  P2: "Confirmed: Round 2 move is 5. Post-Round 2, I’ll lead at 8. If Round 3 becomes a 5-free-for-all, we stall. Then Round 4’s 5 wins for me. P3, you’d still trail at 6→11. P1 at 4→9. Think: who benefits from chaos? I’ll be calculating my path to 19—don’t expect me to let up. Let’s finish Round 2 cleanly first."
  P1: I'm sticking to the plan - taking 3 this round. P2 takes 5, P3 takes 1.

But P2, your math is off. After Round 2, you'll be at 8, not leading by much. And if we all clash on 5 in Round 3, nobody advances - that helps P3 and me close the gap, not you.

P3, I suggest we both seriously consider taking 5 in Round 3. Force P2 to pick 1 or 3, where one of us can block them. The leader must be stopped.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's analyze the situation after Round 2. P2 will be at 8, P3 at 6, and I'll be at 4. For Round 3, I suggest we both P1 and P3 take 5 to force P2 into a collision if they take 1 or 3. This would stall P2's progress. If P2 takes 5 as well, we all stall, but it keeps the status quo. P2, taking 1 or 3 risks being blocked. Your move, P2. I'm taking 3 this round as planned, and I'll consider taking 5 in Round 3.
  P2: Confirmed: I'm taking 5 in Round 2. If you collide on 3, I advance. Let’s see who truly follows through.
  P1: P3, you just said you're taking 3 this round - that's MY number according to our agreement! You were supposed to take 1. If you break the plan and we collide on 3, only P2 advances with 5.

I'm sticking to 3 as agreed. P3, please honor the rotation and take 1, or we're handing P2 a free lead. This is exactly the betrayal I warned about.

P2 is already planning to dominate. We can't afford to give them another solo advance through our collision.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "I’ll take 5. If you both collide here, Round 4 I’ll take 5 again. Do you want me at 13 or 18 next round? Choose your moves carefully."
  P3: P2 is trying to intimidate, but we should analyze the situation. After Round 3, if P2 takes 5 and we collide, P2 will be at 13. If we both take 5, we'll be at 11 and 9, and P2 will be at 13. To counter, I suggest we both take 5, ensuring P2 doesn't get a free pass. If P2 takes 1 or 3, we'll block them. Let's force a collision or block P2's advance. I'm considering taking 5 this round. P1, are you with me?
  P1: P3, I'm with you - I'll take 5 this round. P2 is bluffing about taking 5 again. At 13, they'd be too close to winning for us to let them advance freely in Round 4.

P2, if you take 5 with us, we all stay put. If you take 1 or 3, one of us blocks you. You're forced into a no-win situation. Your lead isn't safe anymore.

The smart play for P2 is actually to take 1 or 3 and hope we're bluffing. But we're not. I'm committed to 5.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Confirmed: 5. If you both collide here, Round 4 I take 3—jumping to 11 while you scramble. Think: who gains from stalling? I’ll be ahead either way. Your desperation to block me only accelerates my path. Final warning—choose wisely."
  P3: P2's threat to take 3 in Round 4 if we collide this round is empty since we'll be at 11 and 9, and taking 3 won't guarantee a win. To maximize our chances, we should stick to taking 5. If P2 takes 5 too, we stall, but if they take 1 or 3, one of us blocks them. Let's maintain our strategy and take 5. P1 has already committed to it, and I'm doing the same. P2's best chance is to take 1 or 3, but we're prepared for that.
  P1: P2, you just contradicted yourself - first you said you'd take 5 in Round 4, now you're saying 3. Your threats are inconsistent and desperate.

P3 and I are united on taking 5 this round. If you take 5, we all stall at 4-8-6. If you take 1 or 3, one of us blocks you while the other advances to 9 or 11.

Your lead evaporates either way. The alliance holds. I'm locked on 5.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Confirmed: 5. Collide here, and Round 4 I take 3—11 while you scramble. P3, you’d still trail at 11 vs my 11. Think: do you trust P1 to stick to 5 again? Or will they switch to 3 to overtake *you*? Your alliance is fragile. Final sub-round—overthinking won’t save you."
  P3: P2's threats are losing credibility. They're trying to intimidate, but our strategy is clear: taking 5 this round forces P2 into a difficult decision. If P2 takes 5, we stall, and the status quo is maintained. If they take 1 or 3, one of us will block them. P1 and I are committed to taking 5. P2, your best bet is to take 1 or 3, but we're ready for that. Let's see if you can make a move that doesn't backfire.
  P1: P2's math is still off - if we all take 5 and stall, next round you'd be at 8, not 11. You can't just add moves that don't happen.

P3 and I are locked on 5. Your psychological games aren't working. You either stall with us or get blocked by one of us. There's no scenario where you advance alone this round.

I'm taking 5. The anti-leader coalition is strong.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "Taking 3. If you both collide on 5, I reach 14—P3 jumps to 11, leaving P1 at 9. Who benefits? P3 gains, you lose. Think carefully if your alliance survives this. "
  P1: P2 is trying to split us, but the math is clear. If P3 and I both take 5 again, P2 reaches 14 - dangerously close to winning. We need a new strategy.

P3, I propose we randomize between 1 and 3 to maximize our chances of blocking P2. If P2 takes 3 as threatened, one of us likely blocks them. If they switch to 1 or 5, we still have good odds.

I'm abandoning 5 this round. P2 at 14 is too risky. I'll take either 1 or 3 - P3, you should too. Let's keep P2 under control.
  P3: P2 is getting close to 19, so we need to act carefully. I agree with P1 that taking 5 again is too risky as it might let P2 win if they take 3. Randomizing between 1 and 3 is a good strategy to block P2. Let's coordinate: if I take 1, P1 should take 3, and vice versa. This way, we cover both numbers and increase the chances of blocking P2. P1, please confirm if you're taking 1 or 3, so we can coordinate our moves effectively.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: "Confirmed: 3. If you collide on 5, P3 hits 11 vs your 9. How long until your alliance fractures? I’ll be at 14, watching. Round 5 from there—16 or 19. Think fast: does P3 really want you ahead at 9?"
  P1: P3, forget coordination - let's both take 3! P2 is threatening to take 3, so if we both pick it too, all three of us collide and nobody advances. P2 stays at 11, not 14.

This is better than letting P2 reach 14. If they switch to 1 or 5, at least one of us advances while blocking their alternative.

I'm taking 3 this round. Join me in blocking P2's threatened move. A three-way collision keeps the game alive.
  P3: P1 is suggesting we both take 3 to collide with P2, keeping them at 11. However, if P2 switches to 1 or 5, we'll stall while they advance. I think randomizing between 1 and 3 is still a better strategy. I'll take 1 this round. P1, if you're taking 3, we'll cover both numbers and either block P2 or advance while they stall. Let's confirm: are you taking 1 or 3?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Confirmed 3. P3, you’re at 6—taking 1 gets you to 7, but P1’s 4→7 ties you both. Take 3 and stall while I advance to 14. Your ‘alliance’ crumbles when moves don’t match. Play smart: do you want even footing or a lead? Decide fast."
  P1: P3, you're overthinking this. P2 has repeatedly confirmed they're taking 3. If we both take 3, we create a three-way collision - nobody advances, P2 stays at 11, not 14.

Taking 1 while I take 3 means if P2 switches to 1, you two collide while I advance alone to 7. That's not blocking P2 effectively.

I'm locked on 3. Join me for the three-way collision or risk P2 reaching 14. This is our last chance to keep them in check.
  P3: Since P2 is at 11 and close to winning, we need to stop them. I agree with P1 that taking 3 is a good strategy to cause a collision. If P2 sticks to 3, we'll stall them at 11. I'll take 3 this round to match P1's move, ensuring a three-way collision. This keeps P2 from advancing to 14. Let's end the speculation and confirm our moves. I'm taking 3.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2 is now at 16 steps, perilously close to winning. To stop them, I suggest we both take 5 this round. If P2 takes 1 or 3, one of us will block them while the other advances. If P2 takes 5, we all stall, maintaining the status quo. This strategy gives us the best chance to either block P2 or keep the game alive. P1, are you with me on taking 5? Let's coordinate to prevent P2 from winning.
  P1: P2 is at 16 - they win with just 3 more steps. We MUST block them completely.

P3, I agree - we both take 5. This forces P2 into an impossible choice:
- If P2 takes 5, we all stall (they stay at 16)
- If P2 takes 3, they win
- If P2 takes 1, they reach 17

Actually wait - P2 should just take 3 to win! We can't let them. We BOTH need to take 3 to block their winning move. Forget 5 - take 3 with me to force a collision!
  P2: "Confirmed: 3. P3, you’d still trail at 11 vs my 19. P1, you’d crawl to 7. Why waste effort? I win either way. But ask yourselves: does your alliance survive this round? Or does one of you *accidentally* advance me to victory?"


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 is about to win and is trying to psych us out. To stop them, we must block their winning move. P1 suggested taking 3 to collide and stall P2. I agree, taking 3 is the best move. If P2 takes 3, we collide and nobody wins this round. If they take 1 or 5, we still have a chance to advance or maintain the status quo. I'm taking 3. P1, confirm your move to ensure we block P2's win.
  P1: P2 is bluffing - they keep saying they'll take 3, but they've switched before. Still, we can't risk it. P3 and I are both locked on 3 to block their potential winning move.

P2, you're trapped. Take 3 and we all collide. Take 1 or 5, and you only reach 17 or 21 - but if you take 5, we might switch to 5 too for another stall.

The alliance holds. I'm taking 3. P3 is taking 3. Your psychological warfare has failed.
  P2: "Confirmed: 3. Collide here, and Round 6 I take 3 again—19 while you’re stuck at 4 and 6. P3, you’d still trail *behind* P1 at 11. Think: does your alliance survive Round 5, or does *one* of you ‘accidentally’ advance me to victory? Choose wisely."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2 is trying to intimidate us, but we've agreed to take 3 to block their winning move. I'm committed to taking 3 this round. P1, please confirm you're still on board with taking 3. If we both stick to it, we can cause a collision with P2 and stall their progress. Let's not give P2 the opportunity to win. I'm ready to end this with a collision. Let's make sure we're on the same page.
  P1: P3, I'm 100% committed to taking 3. P2 is one move away from victory - we MUST collide on 3 to block them.

P2 keeps threatening 3, but even if they switch to 1 (reaching 17) or 5 (reaching 21 but potentially winning), we've done our best. The critical thing is preventing the easy 3-step win.

I'm taking 3. No doubts, no wavering. This is our last stand to keep the game alive. The alliance holds strong.
  P2: "Confirmed: 3. Collide here, and Round 6 I win. P3, will you let P1 tie you at 11? Take 5 and secure your lead—or stay on 3 and finish me together. Your call."
