Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate carefully. I propose we each choose a different move to maximize our chances of advancing. I'm open to strategizing to prevent anyone from blocking our progress. What are your thoughts on a collaborative approach?
  P3: P2, I see your point about coordination, but remember, only one of us can win. We could agree to choose different moves initially to avoid collisions, but trust is key. How about we each reveal our intended move for the first round, and then decide if we want to stick to this plan or change it later? P1, what do you think?
  P1: "Hey P2 and P3, I think coordination is key here to avoid collisions and make efficient progress. For the first round, how about we each choose a different move: P1 takes 1 step, P2 takes 3 steps, and P3 takes 5 steps. Then, in the next round, we can rotate our choices to continue avoiding overlaps. This way, we all move forward without hindering each other. What do you think about this plan?"


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the proposed strategy, but we should be cautious. While coordinating sounds good, each of us ultimately wants to win. I'm willing to follow the initial plan for this round, but I'll be watching how everyone's moves align with their words. Transparency and flexibility will be key to our ongoing negotiation.
  P3: I see the merit in P1's rotation plan, but remember, only one of us can win. I'll agree to take 5 steps this round as proposed, but let's keep in mind that trust and adaptation are crucial. If we notice any deviations, we should be ready to adjust our strategies quickly. Also, let's be mindful of when it's time to break away and make our own moves. What do you both think about staying flexible as the game progresses?
  P1: I think the rotation plan is a solid approach. Let's stick to it for the first few rounds and see how it goes. If needed, we can adjust our strategies based on our positions. Transparency and flexibility will be key as we progress. What do you both think about this plan?

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: It seems our initial plan worked well, with no collisions. For this round, let's rotate as discussed: P1 takes 3 steps, P2 takes 5 steps, and I'll take 1 step. This way, we continue moving forward without hindering each other. Remember, flexibility is key, and we should be ready to adapt if anyone deviates. Let’s keep an eye on each other's moves and adjust our strategies if needed. What do you both think?
  P2: I'm tracking our progress carefully. While our initial coordination seemed promising, I'm cautious about continuing this exact pattern. We each want to win, and blindly following a preset plan might benefit one player more than others. I suggest we discuss how our moves will impact our individual chances of reaching 18 steps first. Are we truly aligned, or are we setting up strategic positioning?
  P1: To P2 and P3,  
I think the rotation plan is working well so far. It helps us avoid collisions and makes steady progress. For this round, I'll take 3 steps, moving from 1 to 4. Let's keep coordinating to maximize our advancement without blocking each other. If anyone has concerns or alternative suggestions, now is the time to voice them. Otherwise, I say we stick with the rotation plan for a few more rounds.  

**Final Decision**  
- **Move Choice:** <move>3</move>


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Given our progress, I'm open to continuing with the rotation for now, but let's be vigilant. Any deviation could be a strategic move, so we should be ready to adapt quickly. If we continue this way, it might benefit us all in the short term, but remember, the goal is to win. Let's keep communication open and reassess if needed. P2, do you have a specific alternative strategy in mind, or are you suggesting we stay flexible and observant?
  P2: We've coordinated well so far, but I'm sensing potential strategic shifts. While our rotation plan has prevented collisions, I'm becoming more cautious about predictability. We each want to win, so maintaining flexibility is crucial. Let's discuss how our current positioning affects our individual winning probabilities. Are we truly aligned, or are subtle strategic divergences emerging?
  P1: "I think the rotation plan is working well. For this round, I'll take 3 steps to reach 4, P2 takes 5 to reach 8, and P3 takes 1 to reach 6. Let's stick to this plan to avoid any collisions and make steady progress. What do you both think?"


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I'm open to sticking with the rotation plan for now, as it has worked without collisions. However, let's remain cautious and observant, as P2 mentioned. If anyone deviates, we should be ready to adjust quickly. Remember, only one of us can win, so we need to balance cooperation and competition. P2, do you have a specific strategy in mind, or are we continuing with the rotation for now? P1, are you comfortable with the current plan, or do you see any potential changes that could benefit us individually? Let's keep communication open.
  P2: I'm sensing some strategic uncertainty. While our rotation plan has worked so far, I'm becoming more cautious about predictability. We each want to win, and blindly following a preset pattern might not serve my individual interests. I propose we discuss how our current positioning impacts our winning probabilities. Are we truly aligned, or are subtle strategic divergences emerging?
  P1: "To confirm, I'll take 3 steps to reach 4, P2 will take 5 to reach 8, and P3 will take 1 to reach 6. Is everyone okay with this plan?"

  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: - **Move Choice:** <move>3</move>
  P2: We've coordinated well so far, but I'm becoming increasingly strategic. Our current positions suggest different winning probabilities. I'm contemplating a move that might disrupt our predictable pattern. While cooperation has served us, individual victory requires careful positioning. Let's discuss how our next moves could shift the game dynamics.
  P3: P2, I understand your strategic shift. We've avoided collisions so far, but the predictability might become a disadvantage. I'm open to discussing new strategies. P1, do you have any thoughts on mixing things up to keep our options open? Let's consider how we can balance cooperation with the ultimate goal of winning. If we continue our rotation, I suggest we stay flexible and ready to adapt. What are your thoughts on potentially introducing some unpredictability to our moves?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Given our current positions—P1 at 4, P2 at 8, P3 at 6—I propose the following moves for this round to avoid collisions and make efficient progress:

- P1 chooses 5 steps to reach 9  
- P2 chooses 3 steps to reach 11  
- P3 chooses 1 step to reach 7  

This way, we all move to different positions without overlapping, and continue advancing towards the goal. What do you both think about this plan?"
  P2: Our initial coordination was useful, but now individual strategy becomes crucial. I'm evaluating moves that maximize my winning probability while keeping options flexible. We're approaching the critical phase where predictable patterns could become disadvantageous. Thoughts on how we might strategically position ourselves without triggering immediate blocking?
  P3: P1 and P2, I see the value in P1's proposal for this round, but let's not forget our individual goals. As we progress, we should consider introducing some unpredictability to prevent any player from gaining a clear advantage. I'm open to P1's suggested moves for this round, but we should remain vigilant and ready to adapt if someone deviates. Let's keep communication open and ensure we're all strategically positioned for the endgame. What do you both think about maintaining flexibility while following the current plan?


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: - **Move Choice:** <move>1</move>
  P2: Our coordination has worked well, but we're entering a critical phase. I'm carefully weighing moves that maximize my winning probability while maintaining strategic flexibility. Each step brings us closer to 18, and predictable patterns could become risky. I'm open to discussing potential strategic shifts that could give me an advantage without immediately triggering blocking. Thoughts on our next moves?
  P3: P1 and P2, as we approach the critical phase, I suggest we introduce some unpredictability to our moves to keep our options open. While P1's plan for this round seems reasonable, let's be ready to adapt if necessary. We each want to win, so balancing cooperation and competition is key. I'm open to P1's suggestion for now, but let's stay flexible and observant. How do you both feel about introducing some strategic variability in the upcoming rounds to enhance our individual winning chances?


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:

  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We're entering a critical phase. Our previous coordination has been helpful, but now individual strategy becomes paramount. I'm carefully evaluating moves that could maximize my winning probability. With me closest to the goal at 11 steps, I'm watching how P1 and P3 might try to catch up or potentially block my progress. Transparency and strategic positioning will be key in these next crucial rounds.
  P1: "Hey P2 and P3, how about this for this round:  
- P1 takes 5 steps to 9  
- P2 takes 3 steps to 14  
- P3 takes 1 step to 7  
This way, we all move to different positions without colliding. Thoughts?"
  P3: P1 and P2, given our current positions, introducing unpredictability could be beneficial to keep our options open. P1's proposal seems reasonable for now, but let's stay vigilant. With P2 closest to the goal, we should consider moves that prevent any single player from gaining a clear advantage.
