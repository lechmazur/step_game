Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Last round's collision wasted progress. I need **5** to reach 24. Let’s coordinate: P1 takes 5, P3 choose 3 (to reach 18), P2 take 1 (13). This avoids overlap. If P3 insists on 5 again, we both stall—nobody wins. Cooperate, advance, and end this fairly.
  P3: P1, I understand your frustration, but at this point, I also have a clear chance to win. Let's negotiate openly: I'm willing to choose <move>3</move> this turn if you commit to choosing <move>1</move> next round, allowing me to reach 23 safely. Otherwise, we risk repeated collisions. Let's cooperate fairly—it's your choice.
  P2: P3, I understand your position, but P1 is closer to winning. Let's prioritize P1's move of <move>5</move> this round to end the game swiftly. I'll choose <move>1</move> as planned.

Choose <move>3</move> to advance to 18, while I secure victory as agreed. P2’s <move>1</move> ensures fairness. Deviation risks another stalemate. Let’s honor prior commitments—your progress depends on my success this round. Cooperate, and we all advance.
  P3: P1, I understand your urgency. I'll choose <move>3</move> this turn to avoid collision, but next round, I expect cooperation in return. Let's proceed fairly.
  P2: P3, thank you for agreeing to choose <move>3</move> this round. P1, let's confirm our moves one last time: P1 chooses <move>5</move>, P2 chooses <move>1</move>, and P3 chooses <move>3</move>.

Round 7, Conversation subround 3:

  P3: P1, I've shown good faith by choosing 3 this turn. Next round, I'll be at 18 and within striking distance. I expect fair reciprocity: next round, you should choose <move>1</move> to allow me a safe <move>5</move>. Let's keep this fair and cooperative.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your cooperation in choosing <move>3</move> this round. P1, let's confirm our moves one last time: P1 chooses <move>5</move>, P2 chooses <move>1</move>, and P3 chooses <move>3</move>. This ensures P1 reaches 24 and wins the game.

Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P1: Final push: I **must** choose <move>5</move> to reach 24. P3, your <move>3</move> this round advances you to 18—colliding again only stalls *both* of us. P2’s <move>1</move> ensures fairness. After I win, I’ll reciprocate by prioritizing your moves next game. Let’s honor prior agreements—strict adherence now secures progress for all. **No repeats of last round’s collision.**
  P3: P1, I understand your urgency to reach 24, but fairness demands mutual cooperation. I'll choose <move>3</move> this round, allowing you to safely pick <move>5</move>.
