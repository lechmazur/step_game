If we all pick 1, we collide and delay the inevitable - I'll just win next round. If I choose 3 or 5, I win immediately with a higher score. The rational choice is letting me take 1 to win with the minimum score of 21. Why force a higher winning score? This is basic game theory - blocking only postpones my victory while keeping you both further behind."}
