Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Let's coordinate to avoid collisions early on. I suggest we all choose different moves this turn: 1, 3, and 5. Who wants which?"
  P2: I'll take 3. P3, you good with 5?
  P3: I'll take 5. P1, that leaves you with 1, right?

  P2: Sounds good to me.

Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
