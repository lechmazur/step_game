Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: Let's coordinate to prevent anyone from moving too far ahead early on. I suggest we each choose a different number to maximize our collective progress while avoiding collisions. What do you think, P2?
  P2: P3, your idea makes sense to avoid collisions. How about this: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and you pick 5? That way, we all move forward without blocking each other. If P1 agrees, we can try this strategy for the first round. What do you think, P1?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P3: We successfully coordinated last round, but now we need to adapt. P2 has already stopped talking, so I'll propose a flexible strategy. I'm open to moving 3 this time to balance our progress and prevent any single player from getting too far ahead. What are your thoughts, P1?
  P2: P3, I appreciate your willingness to adapt. Since P1 has stopped talking, it seems like they might stick to their previous choice. To keep things balanced, I suggest I move 5 this round, while you move 3, maintaining our progress without collisions. This way, we can all advance strategically. What do you think?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I see we're both making good progress. Let's try to avoid colliding again. If P1 is unpredictable, maybe we should coordinate between us. I could go for 1, and you can pick 5, ensuring at least one of us moves forward. What do you think? P1, if you have a preference, feel free to jump in.
  P3: I see P2's suggestion, but I'm cautious about fully committing. We're at different step counts, which changes our strategic interests. I propose we discuss how to prevent anyone from winning too quickly while keeping our own advancement options open. P2's move of 1 could work, but I want to hear more perspectives before deciding.

Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We're at a critical juncture. P2 is closer to winning, so we need a strategy to prevent their victory. I suggest we coordinate to slow down their progress. P1, P2, what are your thoughts on preventing a quick win?
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I understand your concern, but remember, we all want to win. Instead of focusing on stopping me, let's think about how we can all advance without colliding. If we keep blocking each other, none of us will progress efficiently. How about we each choose different numbers again? I can pick 3, you pick 1, and P1 picks 5. This way, we all move forward. What do you think? P1, feel free to share your thoughts if you're open to it.


Round 4, Move phase:

Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>

  P2: P3, I see your strategy, but remember, if we keep blocking each other, none of us will win efficiently. Instead, we could focus on advancing without colliding. I suggest I pick 5, you pick 3, and P1 picks 1. This way, we all move forward, and no one gets stuck. What do you think? P1, feel free to join the conversation if you have a preference.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, it seems like we're all stuck in a cycle of blocking each other. To break this pattern, let's coordinate our moves to maximize progress without collisions.

Let's aim for a smooth round where everyone moves forward. What do you think, P3?
  P3: P2 is getting dangerously close to winning. We need to strategically block their progress this round. I propose we coordinate to prevent their advancement. If P1 and I choose moves that collide with P2's potential move, we can slow them down and keep our own winning chances alive.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I understand your strategy to block me, but remember, we all want to progress. If we keep colliding, none of us advances efficiently.

  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I see your focus on blocking me, but remember, we all need to advance to win. If we keep colliding, none of us will make progress efficiently. Let's try coordinating for mutual benefit: I'll pick 1, you pick 5, and P1 picks 3. This ensures we all move forward without blocking each other. P1, if you have any input, feel free to share. Let's aim for a round where everyone progresses smoothly. What do you think, P3?

  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I understand your focus on blocking me, but constant collisions won't help any of us win. Let's try a different approach: I'll pick 1, you pick 3, and P1 picks 5. This way, we all move forward without blocking each other. P1, if you have any thoughts, feel free to share. Let's aim for a round where everyone progresses smoothly. What do you think, P3?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:

This way, we all move forward without collisions. P1, if you have any thoughts, feel free to share. Let's aim for a round where everyone progresses smoothly. What do you think, P3?
  P1: <stop>
  P3: P2 is very close to winning. P1 remains passive, so I'll be direct: we need to block P2's progress this round. If I choose a move that collides with P2's likely move, I can prevent their victory and keep my own chances alive. Collaboration is key to stopping an imminent win.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your focus on blocking me, but remember, constant collisions won't help any of us win. Let's try a different strategy: I'll pick 1, you pick 3, and P1 picks 5.

  P1: <stop>
  P2: P3, I see you're in a strong position, but don't underestimate the importance of strategic balance. If we all focus solely on blocking, it might lead to a stalemate. Instead, let's consider a path where everyone progresses: I'll pick 1, you pick 3, and P1 picks 5. This way, we all move forward without collisions. P1, your input is welcome if you want to change the dynamics. Let's aim for a round where progress is mutual and strategic. What do you think, P3?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
