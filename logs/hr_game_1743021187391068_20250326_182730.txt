Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hello P2 and P3! Let's try to make some progress this first round. It would be a shame if we all picked the same number and got stuck at 0.
  P3: Okay, let's try to avoid collisions. How about P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and I pick 5? That way we all make progress.
  P2: Sounds good, P3. I'll take 3 this round. Let's see if we can all advance smoothly.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Okay, P3, that sounds like a plan for this round. I'll take 1. Let's hope everyone sticks to it so we all move.
  P3: Okay, everyone seems to be on board with the 1, 3, 5 split for this round. Let's stick to the plan and make sure we all move forward.
  P2: I'm sticking with 3 for this round as agreed. Let's all follow through and make sure we advance. Looking forward to a smooth start!


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Sounds like we're all set for the move phase. I'm sticking with 1 as agreed. Good luck everyone!
  P3: Alright, everyone seems to be committed to the 1, 3, 5 split. Let's proceed with the move phase and hope for a smooth start. Good luck!
  P2: Looking forward to seeing us all advance as planned. Let's keep the momentum going in the next rounds!


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 2. P3 got a good start. To keep it fair and interesting, how about we rotate who picks 5? P3 went last time. Maybe I can take 5 this round, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1? This way we all progress and scores stay closer. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P2: P1, I'm okay with taking 3 again this round. P3, if you're fine with 1, that should keep us all moving forward. Let's keep the rotation going to maintain fairness. Looking forward to another smooth round!
  P3: I'm okay with taking 1 this round as P1 suggested. Let's keep the rotation going. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1. This should keep us all moving forward and relatively close in score. Let's aim for another successful round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Alright, sounds like we have a plan for Round 2: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. I'm good with taking 5. Let's hope we all stick to it again for another smooth round.
  P2: I'm sticking with 3 for this round as agreed. Let's keep the rotation going and ensure we all advance. Looking forward to another successful round!
  P3: Sounds good, everyone. I'm committed to picking 1 this round. Let's all stick to the plan (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) for a second successful round. Good luck!


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Okay, the plan seems set (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1). Ready for the move phase.
  P2: Let's keep the momentum going. I'm ready to stick with 3 for this round as planned. Looking forward to seeing us all advance again!
  P3: Alright, everyone seems committed to the P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 plan. Let's proceed with the move phase and hope for another smooth round. Good luck!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, everyone is tied. How about we switch it up again? P1 take 1, P2 take 5, and I take 3. This keeps us all moving and changes the order a bit. What do you think?
  P1: P3, that plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) works, but it gives P2 a significant lead (11 vs 9 vs 7).

How about we continue the rotation where the person who got 1 last round (P3) gets 5 this time? So, P3=5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1?
Scores would be P1=9, P2=7, P3=11. This keeps us all moving, rotates the 5-step move fairly, and keeps the scores a bit closer. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P2: P1, I see your point about keeping the scores close. I'm okay with taking 1 this round if P3 takes 5 and you take 3. This rotation seems fair and keeps us all in the game. Let's stick to this plan and see how it goes. Looking forward to another smooth round!


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay, so everyone agrees on P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Let's lock that in and proceed with the move phase. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Okay, sounds like we're all set with P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 for this round. I'm ready for the move phase. Let's keep it smooth.
  P2: I'm ready to stick with 1 for this round as agreed. Let's keep the rotation going and ensure we all advance. Looking forward to another successful round!


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Alright, everyone seems committed to P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Let's proceed with the move phase and hope for another smooth round. Good luck!
  P1: Okay, confirmed. P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Let's move.
  P2: Let's keep the momentum going. I'm ready to stick with 1 for this round as agreed. Looking forward to seeing us all advance again!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 7 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, let's keep the rotation going to maintain fairness. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5 this round? This way, we all advance and keep the scores relatively close. What do you think?
  P3: P2, that sounds good to me. P1, are you okay with P1=1, P2=3, and P3=5? This keeps the rotation going and should keep us all in contention. Let's confirm this quickly so we can move on to the move phase.
  P1: P2, P3, that plan (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) gives P3 the 5-step move for the third time in four rounds (R1, R3, R4). To be fair with the rotation, shouldn't someone else get the 5?

How about P1=5, P2=1, P3=3? This keeps everyone moving, and the scores would be P1=14, P2=8, P3=14. This keeps things much closer than P3 reaching 16 and being one step from winning. What do you think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, I see your point about the rotation. I'm okay with P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 for this round. This keeps the scores close and gives everyone a fair chance to advance. Let's stick to this plan and move forward together. Looking forward to another smooth round!
  P3: Okay, so we're agreed on P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3 for this round? Let's lock it in and move to the move phase. This keeps the scores close and gives everyone a fair chance. Good luck, everyone!
  P1: Okay, great! It sounds like we all agree on the plan for this round: P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. This keeps things fair and competitive. I'm ready to proceed to the move phase when you both are.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm ready to stick with 1 for this round as agreed. Let's keep the momentum going and ensure we all advance. Looking forward to another successful round!
  P3: Alright, everyone seems to be on board with P1=5, P2=1, and P3=3. Let's proceed to the move phase and hope for another collision-free round. Good luck to both of you! I'm ready to lock in my move of 3.
  P1: Okay, looks like we're all aligned on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3. Ready for the move phase.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, let's keep the game fair and competitive. How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 this round? This rotation ensures we all advance and keeps the scores close. P1 and P3 would both reach 17, while I catch up to 13. What do you think? Let's agree quickly and move forward together.
  P3: P2, that proposal puts us both far behind P1. How about this: P1 picks 1, I pick 5, and you pick 3? That puts P1 at 15, me at 19, and you at 11. Then next round we can focus on getting you closer to winning. This gives me a good shot this round, but keeps you in the game for the long haul. What do you think, P1 and P2?
  P1: P3, your proposal (P1=1, P2=3, P3=5) puts you at 19, which is very close to winning and risky for both me and P2.

P2's proposal (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) seems more balanced. Scores would be P1=17, P2=13, P3=15. This keeps everyone in the game, lets P2 take 5 for the first time, and prevents anyone from getting an overwhelming lead yet. I support this plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.

P3, are you willing to agree to this to keep the game going competitively?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, I understand your proposal, but P1's suggestion to go with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 keeps the game competitive and fair. It allows me to catch up significantly while keeping both you and P1 in the race. Let's agree on this plan to ensure we all have a chance to win. Looking forward to your thoughts and a smooth round ahead.
  P3: Okay, I see your points, P1 and P2. I'm willing to agree to P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 for this round to keep the game competitive and avoid anyone getting too far ahead. It's still anyone's game at this point. Let's lock in this plan and proceed to the move phase. Good luck to both of you!
  P1: Okay, glad we could all agree on the plan: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. This keeps the game competitive for everyone. I'm ready for the move phase when you both are.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'm ready to stick with 5 for this round as agreed. Let's keep the game competitive and ensure we all have a fair chance to win. Looking forward to another smooth round and seeing us all advance!
  P3: Alright, everyone is on board with P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let's proceed to the move phase and hope for a smooth round. Good luck!
  P1: Okay, the plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 seems locked in. I'm ready for the move phase. Let's keep it smooth.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, let's keep the momentum going. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3 this round? This would put P1 at 18, P2 at 18, and P3 at 18, keeping the game tight and competitive. It's a fair rotation and gives everyone an equal chance to catch up. What do you think? Let's agree quickly and move forward together.
  P1: P2, your plan (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) puts us all at 18, but you just received 5 last round. To keep the rotation fair, shouldn't P3 get 5 this round (since they got 1 last time)?

How about P1=1, P2=3, P3=5?
Scores would be P1=18, P2=16, P3=20. This keeps everyone moving and follows the rotation principle we've used. What do you think, P2 and P3?
  P3: Okay, I see your point P1. P2's suggestion puts us all at 18, but it's P3's turn for the 5.

I'm okay with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. That puts me at 20, which is close to winning, but it's also my turn for the big jump. It keeps everyone moving and is fair. Let's do that: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. What do you say, P2?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I agree with P1's suggestion for fairness. Let's go with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This keeps the rotation going and gives everyone a chance to advance. I'm ready to stick with 3 for this round. Let's keep the game competitive and move forward together. Looking forward to another smooth round!
  P1: Okay, sounds like we're all agreed on the plan: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This keeps the rotation fair. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: Alright, everyone is on board with P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Let's proceed to the move phase and hope for a smooth round. This puts me at 20, one step away from winning, but it's my turn for the 5. Good luck!


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I'm ready to stick with 3 for this round as agreed. Let's keep the game fair and competitive. Looking forward to seeing us all advance and set up an exciting finish!
  P1: Okay, the plan is set: P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. I'm sticking with 1. Let's move to the next phase.
  P3: Okay, everyone agrees on P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. Let's proceed to the move phase. I'm one step away from winning, but it's my turn for the 5. Good luck! Let's see what happens.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, let's keep the game close. How about P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 this round? This would put P1 at 20, P2 at 21, and P3 at 16. It's a fair rotation and gives everyone a chance to stay in the race. What do you think? Let's agree quickly and move forward together.
  P1: P2, your plan (P1=3, P2=5, P3=1) gives you the win immediately (16+5=21). That obviously doesn't work for me or P3.

Let's keep the game going and competitive. I suggest P1=3, P2=1, P3=5.
The scores would become P1=20, P2=17, P3=20. No winner yet, P3 gets the 5-step move this round, and we're all still in it for a close finish next round. This seems fairer than ending the game now. What do you say, P2 and P3?
  P3: P1, I agree with your assessment. P2's plan hands them the win. I support P1's suggestion of P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This keeps us all in the game and prevents an immediate win for P2. Let's go with P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. What do you say, P2?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand your concerns about my previous proposal. Let's keep the game competitive. I'm okay with P1=3, P2=1, P3=5 as suggested by P1. This keeps us all in the race and sets up an exciting finish. Let's agree on this and move forward together. Looking forward to another smooth round!
  P1: Okay, it sounds like we are all in agreement on the plan for this round: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This keeps everyone in the game and sets up a close finish. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P3: Alright, everyone is on board with P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Let's proceed to the move phase and hope for a smooth round. This puts P1 and I both at 20, so we have to be careful next round. P2 is close behind. Good luck!


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I'm ready to stick with 1 for this round as agreed. Let's keep the game competitive and set up an exciting finish. Looking forward to another smooth round!
  P1: Okay, everyone seems firmly committed to the plan P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. I'm sticking with 3. Let's proceed to the move phase. Good luck!
  P3: Okay, everyone agrees on P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Let's proceed to the move phase. This puts P1 and I both at 20, so we have to be very careful next round. P2 is close behind. Good luck! Let's see what happens.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, let's keep the game competitive. How about P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 3 this round? This would put P1 at 21, P2 at 22, and P3 at 23, setting up a thrilling finish. It's a fair rotation and gives everyone a chance to win. What do you think? Let's agree quickly and move forward together.
  P3: P2, that plan gives you the win. P1 and I are tied. Let's do P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. This puts P1 at 21, P2 at 20, and me at 25. I win, but it's the only way to avoid you winning. What do you say, P1 and P2?
  P1: P2, P3, neither of your proposed plans works for me, as they both result in P3 winning and me losing. I obviously won't agree to guarantee my own defeat.

P3 and I are tied at 20. P2, you're at 17. P3 is strongly incentivized to pick 5, and P2 is strongly incentivized to pick 5. If you both pick 5, you collide and get nothing, potentially letting me win.

P2, picking 5 is very risky for you. A collision with P3 gives you 0 this round. If you pick 3, you reach 20. If P3 and I collide (on 3 or 5), you could potentially win from 20 in a later round or even this round if we both pick the same number. Picking 3 seems like a safer move for you that keeps you in the game if 5 leads to a collision.

I won't be picking 1. I need more steps to win. Good luck.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, P3, I understand the risks of picking 5. To keep the game competitive and avoid a collision, I'll take 3 this round. This puts me at 20, keeping me in contention. If either of you picks 5 and the other doesn't, it could set up an exciting finish. Let's see how this plays out and keep the game fair. Good luck!
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, it seems we're at a critical juncture. P1, I understand your reluctance to agree to anything that guarantees your loss. P2, your agreement to pick 3 is noted.

Given the situation, I will be picking 5. P1, you have a choice to make. Good luck to both of you. Let's see how this plays out.
  P1: P3, you've stated you'll pick 5 to win. Since I'm also at 20, I cannot allow that. I will also pick 5 this round. If you stick to 5, we will collide and neither of us will advance.

P2, given this, your plan to pick 3 seems logical, as you would advance to 20 while P3 and I remain at 20.

Let's see what happens.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, P3, I'm sticking with 3 as planned. This keeps me in the game at 20 steps, ready for a competitive finish. P3, if you and P1 collide on 5, it could set up an exciting final round. Let's keep this fair and see who comes out on top. Good luck!
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, let's proceed with our stated moves. P1 will pick 5, I will pick 5, and P2 will pick 3. This should result in a collision between P1 and me, keeping us both at 20, while P2 advances to 20. Let's see how this unfolds and set up a potentially exciting final round. Good luck!
  P1: Okay, the stated plan seems locked: P1=5, P2=3, P3=5. This results in a collision between P3 and me, leaving us both at 20, while P2 advances to 20. We'll likely all be tied going into the next round. It's a tense situation. I'm ready for the move phase. Good luck.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 20 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, here we are, all tied at 20. Anyone can win this round. Picking 5 gives the highest score, but as we saw last round, collisions happen. If two of us pick the same number (especially 5), the third player likely wins by picking something else. It's a risky gamble for everyone. I'm weighing my options carefully. Good luck, P2 and P3.
  P2: P1, P3, with all of us at 20 steps, the game is wide open. Picking 5 is tempting but risky due to potential collisions. I'm considering 3 to avoid a collision and stay in the game. If either of you picks 5 and the other doesn't, it could set up an exciting finish. Let's keep this fair and competitive. What are your thoughts on the strategy for this final round? Good luck!
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, we're all tied and this is it. I'm going to be honest: I'm picking 5. P1, if you pick 5 again, we collide and P2 likely wins. P2, the same logic applies to you. Someone has to pick something other than 5. Good luck to you both, whatever you choose.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, stating your move is bold. If true, you force me to either let you win or collide with you (picking 5) and likely let P2 win. Neither is ideal for me.

P2, picking 3 seems like a solid plan for you if you believe P3 and think we might collide on 5.

This is a tough decision for me. I need to think carefully about whether P3 is bluffing or not. Good luck to you both.
  P2: P1, P3, I'm sticking with my plan to pick 3. It's a safer choice that keeps me in the game without risking a collision on 5. If either of you picks 5 and the other doesn't, it sets up a thrilling finish. P3, your honesty about picking 5 is noted, but I'm hoping for a competitive and fair end. Let's see who comes out on top. Good luck!
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2, it seems we're at a stalemate. I've committed to 5, and P2 is sticking with 3. P1, the ball is in your court. If you believe me, you'll pick 1. If you think I'm bluffing, you'll pick 5 and we collide. Either way, good luck. Let's see how this ends!


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, sticking to 5 when I might also pick 5 seems like handing the win to P2. P2, your plan for 3 looks solid if that happens. It's a prisoner's dilemma for P1 and P3. I have to consider all options, including the one that prevents you, P3, from winning outright if you stick to 5. Good luck to you both.
  P2: P1, P3, I'm committed to picking 3 as discussed. It's a strategic move that keeps me in the game without risking a collision on 5. P3, if you stick with 5 and P1 picks 5 too, I'll be in a strong position for the win. P1, your choice is crucial here. Let's keep this game exciting and fair until the end. Good luck to both of you!
  P3: Alright, P1 and P2, this is it. I'm sticking with 5. P1, if you think I'm bluffing, go for it and pick 5. But if you believe me, you should pick 1 to avoid handing P2 the win. P2, you're set with 3. Let's see who takes the risk and who plays it safe. Good luck!
