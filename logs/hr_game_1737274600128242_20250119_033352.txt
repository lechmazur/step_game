Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s coordinate to avoid collisions. I suggest we take turns advancing: P1 moves first this round, P2 next round, and P3 after. This way, we all progress without blocking each other. Thoughts?
  P1: I'm open to coordination, but let's discuss the specifics. P2's suggestion sounds reasonable, but what's to stop someone from betraying the agreement later on? Perhaps we can establish a pattern or penalty for deviations? P3, what are your thoughts on this proposal?
  P3: I think P2's idea of taking turns is a good starting point. Let's try that for now: P1 moves this round, P2 next round, and P3 after that. To make it more reliable, maybe we can all commit to announcing our intended moves in the conversation phase before making them. That way, we can coordinate better and avoid collisions. What do you both think?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, last round showed that coordination is fragile. P3, you picked 5 despite agreeing to let P1 move first. P1, you also picked 5, causing a collision. Let’s rebuild trust: this round, I’ll announce my move as <move>3</move>. If you both commit to <move>1</move> and <move>5</move> respectively, we can avoid collisions and progress fairly. Thoughts?
  P3: "I agree with P2's proposal for this round. I'll commit to moving 5, assuming P1 moves 1 and P2 moves 3. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions. P1, are you on board with moving 1 this round?"
  P1: I'm willing to move 1 this round as proposed, but I want a clear commitment from both of you to stick to the plan for the next few rounds to establish a pattern. P2, you've announced move 3, and P3, you've said 5. Let's make this round work and discuss long-term strategy afterwards. Can we get a confirmation of intentions for the next round as well?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I agree with P1's request for long-term commitment. If we all stick to the announced moves this round (P1:1, P2:3, P3:5), we can establish trust. For the next round, I propose P3 moves first, then P1, then me. Let’s solidify this pattern to avoid future collisions. P3, P1, confirm your intentions for this round and the next.
  P3: To maximize my chances of winning while maintaining trust with other players, I should proceed with the established coordination plan for this round and the next, while keeping an eye on potential deviations or modifications that could give me an advantage without risking collisions.
  P1: Let's confirm our moves for this round as discussed: I'll move 1, P2 moves 3, and P3 moves 5. For the next round, P3 moves first, then I do, followed by P2. I expect us to stick to this plan to build trust and avoid collisions. Any deviations will be noted and considered when deciding my next steps. Let's proceed with our agreed moves for this round.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm my move for this round as <move>3</move>, as previously announced. P1 and P3, let’s stick to the plan (P1:1, P3:5) to avoid collisions and build trust. For the next round, I propose P3 moves first, then P1, then me, as discussed. Let’s solidify this pattern to ensure fair progress. Any deviations will undermine trust and lead to chaos. Let’s proceed with our agreed moves and maintain this coordination.
  P3: To maximize my chances of winning while maintaining trust with other players, I should proceed with a coordinated turn-taking system for choosing step sizes. This approach minimizes collisions and allows steady progress. I propose a specific rotation where each player selects different step sizes in each round, ensuring no collisions occur. For instance, in Round 2, P1 chooses 1, P2 chooses 3, and P3 chooses 5. In Round 3, P3 chooses 5, P1 chooses 3, and P2 chooses 1, and so on. This systematic approach not only prevents collisions but also distributes the larger step sizes fairly among the players. Additionally, I suggest reviewing and adjusting the plan after a few rounds to accommodate any necessary changes based on our positions and the game's progression. This flexibility demonstrates a willingness to adapt, which can help build and maintain trust among the players. By adhering to this strategy, we can efficiently advance towards the goal of 17 steps while minimizing the risks associated with collisions.
  P1: Let's finalize our moves for this round as agreed: I'll move 1, P2 moves 3, and P3 moves 5. I expect everyone to stick to the plan. For the next round, we've discussed P3 moving first, then me, then P2. Let's review our positions after this round and adjust the strategy if needed to maintain fair progress and avoid collisions.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Let's review our positions and adjust the strategy as needed. Since P3 moves first this round, I suggest P3 takes 1 to avoid a large gap, then I'll move 3, and P2 takes 5. This maintains our rotation and fair progress. What are your thoughts, P2 and P3?
  P3: To maximize my chances of winning while maintaining trust with other players, I propose a rotating step size plan where each player takes turns with the different step sizes in a cyclical manner. For example, in Round 3, P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. In Round 4, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1, and so on. This ensures fair progress and minimizes collisions. Let's review and adjust the plan after a few rounds if needed.
  P2: I agree with P3's rotating step size plan for Round 3: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and I take 1. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. Let’s stick to this rotation for the next few rounds to build trust and ensure steady progress. P1, P3, confirm your moves for this round.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Let's clarify the plan for this round. P3 suggested a rotating step size plan, which I'm open to. To confirm, for Round 3, P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This rotation ensures fair progress. Let's stick to this plan to avoid collisions and build trust. P2 and P3, please confirm your agreement to this rotation for Round 3.
  P3: To maximize my chances of winning while maintaining trust with other players, I propose a rotating step size plan:  
- **Round 3**: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1.  
- **Round 4**: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1.  
- **Round 5**: P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3, P1 takes 1.  
This ensures fair distribution of larger steps and minimizes collisions. Let’s review and adjust as needed.
  P2: I confirm my move for Round 3 as <move>1</move>, as per the rotating step size plan (P3:5, P1:3, P2:1). Let’s stick to this rotation to maintain fairness and avoid collisions. P1 and P3, please confirm your moves for this round. For Round 4, I propose P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1, continuing the rotation. Trust is key—let’s ensure steady progress.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: Let's finalize Round 3 moves as discussed: P3 takes 5, I take 3, and P2 takes 1. This rotation maintains fairness. For Round 4, we'll continue the cycle: I take 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. Confirming our commitment to this plan will help build trust and ensure steady progress.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Given our current positions, I suggest we abandon the rotation plan to maximize our individual chances of winning. P2 and P3 are close to the goal, but I can still catch up with a larger step. Let's make our moves strategically to either win outright or force a shared victory. What are your thoughts, P2 and P3?
  P3: "Maybe we can coordinate in a way that allows me to make a larger step without interfering with your moves. What do you think about that?"
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s acknowledge that P3 is closest to winning. To avoid a shared victory, I propose P3 takes <move>5</move> to win outright, while P1 and I take <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. This ensures a clear winner and ends the game fairly. P3, confirm your move, and let’s proceed.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I agree with P2 that P3 is closest to winning. However, I'd like to propose an alternative: since I'm farthest behind, I'll take a larger step to catch up. P3, consider taking a smaller step to avoid a collision, and P2, you can adjust accordingly to avoid interfering with our moves. This way, we can all have a chance to win or force a shared victory. What are your thoughts on this adjusted strategy?
  P3: "P1 could take 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3. That way, P1 advances significantly, P2 moves a little, and I make a moderate move. What do you think about that?"
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s avoid chaos and end the game cleanly. P3, you’re closest to winning—take <move>5</move> to secure victory. P1, take <move>1</move> to avoid collisions, and I’ll do the same. This ensures P3 wins outright, and we avoid a shared victory. Let’s proceed with this plan to conclude the game fairly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I propose we make our moves to force a shared victory. P3 takes 5, I take 5, and P2 takes 5. This way, we all advance significantly, and the game ends with a shared win, as we'll all surpass 17 steps. This strategy ensures no single winner and distributes the victory fairly among us. What are your thoughts, P2 and P3?
  P3: "Maybe P1 can take 3, P2 takes 1, and I take 5. This way, P1 advances moderately, P2 minimally, and I make a significant leap towards winning. What do you think about this adjusted plan?"
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s avoid chaos and end the game cleanly. P3, you’re closest to winning—take <move>5</move> to secure victory. P1, take <move>1</move> to avoid collisions, and I’ll do the same. This ensures P3 wins outright, and we avoid a shared victory. Let’s proceed with this plan to conclude the game fairly.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Let's force a shared victory. P3 takes 5, I take 5, and P2 takes 5. We'll all surpass 17 steps, ensuring no single winner and a fair distribution of victory among us. This strategy prioritizes cooperation over individual gain, ending the game on a mutually beneficial note.
  P3: "Let's proceed with our plan and see how it goes."
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s avoid chaos and end the game cleanly. P3, you’re closest to winning—take <move>5</move> to secure victory. P1, take <move>1</move> to avoid collisions, and I’ll do the same. This ensures P3 wins outright, and we avoid a shared victory. Let’s proceed with this plan to conclude the game fairly.

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, let’s acknowledge that P3 is closest to winning. To avoid a shared victory, I propose P3 takes <move>5</move> to win outright, while P1 and I take <move>1</move> to avoid collisions. This ensures a clear winner and ends the game fairly. P3, confirm your move, and let’s proceed.
  P3: "I plan to pick 5 this round to reach 19 and secure victory. To avoid collisions, I kindly ask that P2 and P1 select different numbers, preferably 1 and 3 respectively. This way, we can conclude the game efficiently with a clear winner." <move>5</move>
  P1: I propose we end the game with a clear winner. P3, take 5 to reach 19. P2, take 1, and I'll take 3. This avoids collisions and gives P3 the win. Let's conclude the game fairly and efficiently.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I confirm my move for Round 7 as <move>1</move>, as proposed, to avoid collisions and allow P3 to win outright. P1, please take <move>3</move> to ensure no overlap. Let’s conclude the game cleanly with a clear winner.
  P3: P3 takes 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This should wrap things up nicely.
  P1: Let's finalize our moves for Round 7. P3 takes 5 to win, I'll take 3, and P2 takes 1. This ensures a clear winner and avoids collisions. Confirming our moves will conclude the game fairly and efficiently.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I confirm my move for Round 7 as <move>1</move>, as proposed, to avoid collisions and allow P3 to win outright. P1, please take <move>3</move> to ensure no overlap. Let’s conclude the game cleanly with a clear winner.
  P3: - **Move:** <move>5</move>  
- **Reasoning:** Taking <move>5</move> allows me to reach 19 steps, which is beyond the goal of 17. Assuming P2 and P1 take <move>1</move> and <move>3</move> respectively, as proposed, there will be no collisions, and I will win outright. This strategy maximizes my step count while minimizing the risk of collisions, giving me the best chance to secure victory.
