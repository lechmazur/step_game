Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Hey everyone! Since we're all starting fresh, maybe we should coordinate the first few moves to avoid collisions? Nobody wins if we all pick the same numbers and stay stuck at zero. What do you think - should we each pick different numbers this round?
  P2: Sounds good! To avoid collisions, I’ll take 5, P1 you take 1, P3 you take 3.
  P3: Okay, P2's suggestion sounds good for avoiding collisions. I'll plan on 3.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Alright, I'll go with 1 then. Let's get this game moving!
  P2: All right, locking in 5 for me, P1 takes 1, P3 takes 3. Ready?
  P3: Okay, sounds like we have a plan for the first round. I'm ready to make my move (3).


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, that didn't go as planned! P2 and I both went for 5 despite our agreement, so we collided and P3 got ahead. Clearly we can't fully trust each other's word here. 

P3, you're in the lead now with 3 steps. P2 and I are both stuck at zero, so maybe we should work together to catch up? Though after last round, I'm not sure how much we can trust any coordination attempts.

What's everyone thinking for this round?
  P3: Okay, that first round certainly didn't go as planned for P1 and P2! I stuck to the plan and advanced. My lead is only 3 steps though, that's not much in a race to 21.

P1, you're right, trust is low, especially since you also didn't stick to the number you said you would pick (1).

What do you two propose we do this round to avoid another collision and get everyone moving?
  P2: I say we all pick 5 this round. That way we collide, nobody moves, and P3’s lead stays at 3 while we avoid further falling behind. If someone deviates, we’ll see exactly who.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, that plan basically hands P3 the win by preserving their lead while we stay stuck. Why would I agree to that? 

If we're going to coordinate, let's at least make it fair - maybe P3 takes 1 to slow down while P2 and I take 3 and 5 to catch up? Or we could all pick different numbers again, but this time actually stick to what we say.

I'm not interested in a plan that keeps me losing while P3 cruises to victory.
  P3: Okay, P1, I agree that taking 1 isn't ideal for me, as I'd prefer to keep moving forward. It's tough to coordinate when we can't fully trust each other, as Round 1 showed.

How about we try assigning numbers differently this round to avoid collisions? Perhaps P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and I take 3? This gives everyone a different number and lets us all advance if we stick to it. What do you both think?
  P2: P3’s plan still leaves me too slow. How about P1=3, P2=5, P3=1? Unique picks, no collisions, and I can close the gap. Next round I can help you catch up. Who’s in?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2's proposal puts you in the lead while leaving me in last place - I'm not thrilled about that. But given how Round 1 went, I'm skeptical any coordination will actually work anyway. 

If we're really going to try this again, fine - P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. But honestly, after last round I'm expecting someone to deviate again. We'll see who actually sticks to their word this time.
  P3: Okay, the proposed plan is P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. Let's see how the moves play out.
  P2: I’m locking in 5 this turn. P1, please take 3 and P3 take 1 so we all advance without collision. This is our best shot to close the gap—let’s stick to it.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I’m done playing nice. I’ll pick 5 this turn to close the gap. If you want to advance, avoid 5—otherwise we’ll collide and nobody moves. Good luck!
  P3: Okay P2, I understand. I will pick a different number this round to avoid colliding with you.
  P1: P2, you're already in the lead and now you're threatening to extend it further. I'm not going to just let you run away with this game. 

P3, after two rounds of failed coordination, maybe it's time we both focus on stopping the leader rather than letting them cruise to victory.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m locking in 5 this turn. P1 and P3: if you want to advance, choose 3 and 1—any 5 from either of you just causes a collision and nobody moves. Take the free steps now, and we can talk alliances next round.
  P3: Okay P1, I understand the concern about P2's lead. As I said, I will pick a number other than 5 this round to avoid colliding with P2.

P1, you are at zero steps. What move will you make to contest P2?
  P1: P2, you can't just threaten your way to victory. If you think I'm going to stand by and watch you cruise to 10 steps while I'm stuck at zero, you're wrong. 

P3, we're both going to lose if we let the leader dictate terms. Sometimes you have to be willing to collide with the frontrunner to prevent them from running away with the game.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, picking 5 to block me only leaves you at 3 while P3 steps forward and widens the gap. Your best play is 3 to get to 6. P3, pick 1 so you don’t collide with P1. I’m locked in on 5. Let’s all advance cleanly.
  P3: P1, I hear you on stopping the leader. As I said, I won't pick 5 this round. I'll choose my move to advance while keeping the game competitive.
  P1: P2, you're trying to bully your way to a 10-step lead while I'm stuck at zero. That's not happening. I'm picking 5 this round to block you - we'll both stay put while P3 advances. Better to keep this competitive than let you run away with it.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Interesting how that played out! P2, you cleverly said you'd pick 5, got me to block with 5, then actually picked 1 to advance. Well played.

Now P2 and P3 are tied at 6 steps. Since you two are the leaders, maybe it's time you start worrying about each other instead of just me? 

I'm thinking of going big this round - maybe 5 to catch up to 10. Unless one of you wants to coordinate to keep this competitive rather than letting the other pull ahead?
  P2: P3, let’s team up this turn: we both pick 5. If P1 also picks 5, collision—nobody moves and we stay tied as leaders. If P1 picks 3 or 1 to advance, we jump to 11 and pull clear. Either way P1 can’t catch up. Are you in?
  P3: Okay P2, teaming up to both pick 5 is an interesting idea. It definitely puts pressure on P1, especially since they mentioned considering 5 themselves.

It could be a way for us to solidify our lead or prevent P1 from jumping ahead. I'll need to think about the best move this round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, Round 4 saw P1 and P2 collide on 5 while I advanced with 3, putting me at 9 steps. P2 is at 6, P1 at 5. I have a decent lead now. My focus is on reaching 21. How are you two planning to move forward this round without colliding, or perhaps you have other plans?
  P1: P3, you're dangerously close to winning - only 12 steps away from 21. P2 and I can't let you cruise to victory.

P2, I know trust is low after all the failed coordination, but we're both going to lose if we don't work together to stop P3. What if we both pick 5 this round? Either we force a three-way collision if P3 goes for 5, or we both jump to 10-11 and stay competitive if P3 plays it safe with a smaller number.

We can't afford to let P3 get much further ahead.
  P2: P1, I’m with you—I’ll lock in 5 this round. P3, your choice: pick 5 and we collide, or pick 3 to go to 12, or pick 1 to go to 10. What’s it going to be?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I hear your plan to both pick 5.

As I said before, I won't be picking 5 this round. I will choose my move to advance towards 21.
  P1: P3, you're being very coy about your exact move, but if you're avoiding 5, you're probably going with 1 or 3. Either way puts you at 10-12 steps while P2 and I jump to 10-11. 

P2, let's stick to the plan - both of us pick 5. We can't let P3 get too far ahead or this game is over. Time to make our move and keep this competitive.
  P2: P3, since you won’t pick 5, commit to 1. I’ll take 5—moving me to 11 and you to 10. P1, you’re at 5: if you pick 5 you hit 10 but I still lead; any other choice leaves you further behind. This is our best shot to lock down the top two spots—P3 and me.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay P2, I heard your proposal for me to pick 1. As I've said, I will not be picking 5 this round. I will make the move that I believe best helps me advance towards 21.
  P1: P2, I notice you're now trying to coordinate with P3 to secure the top two spots while leaving me behind. That's not the alliance we just agreed on!

If you're serious about stopping P3 from winning, we both pick 5 as planned. But if you're switching sides to partner with the leader, then I'll have to play accordingly.

P3, you're still being evasive about your exact move. The math is simple - you're 12 steps from victory and we can't let you get much closer.
  P2: P1, let’s do P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. I’m locked in 5. That way we all advance safely—no collisions—putting me at 11, P3 at 10, and you at 8. Keeps everyone moving and keeps P3 in check.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, I'm still leading at 9 steps, with P1 at 8 and P2 at 6. My focus is on reaching 21 steps. I'll be making a move to advance this round. Let's see if we can avoid colliding and get everyone moving forward.
  P1: P3, you're only 12 steps from victory and clearly the biggest threat right now. You keep saying you want to "advance" but won't commit to specific numbers.

P2, despite our rocky history with coordination, P3 is about to run away with this game. We're both going to lose if we don't work together here. 

I'm thinking we should both pick 5 this round - either we force P3 into a three-way collision, or we both jump to 11-13 and stay competitive while P3 takes a smaller step. What do you say?
  P2: I have a better plan than crashing on 5. Let’s all pick unique this turn: P1=3, P2=5, P3=1. That lands P1 and me at 11 steps and P3 at 10—tying us for the lead and forcing P3 to catch up. P3, will you commit to 1? P1, are you in?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P2, I hear your proposal for me to pick 1. As I've stated, my priority is advancing towards 21, and picking 1 is not the best way for me to do that from my current position.

I will be making a move to advance this round. P1 and P2, you should consider your own moves carefully to avoid collisions or being left behind.
  P1: P2, P3 is clearly not going to cooperate with any plan that limits their advancement. They're rejecting your proposal because they want to pick 3 or 5 for bigger gains.

Look at the math - if P3 picks 5 this round, they'll be at 14 steps and only 7 away from winning. We can't let that happen!

I'm going with 5 this round. Join me - either we force P3 into a collision if they also pick 5, or we both advance significantly while P3 takes a smaller step. Stop trying to negotiate with someone who won't commit to anything!
  P2: I’m locking in 5 and propose P1 picks 3. P3, if you pick 3 you collide with P1 and neither of you moves while I jump to 11. If you pick 1 you end at 10 while P1 and I both hit 11. Either way you’re behind. P1, you tie the lead at 11; P3, you fall back. Let’s do P1=3, P2=5.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, I've stated my position clearly. I am focused on advancing towards 21 and will not be picking 5 this round. My move will reflect this goal.

You two should consider your own moves carefully to avoid collisions or being left behind.
  P1: P2, fine - I'll go with your plan. I'll pick 3 this round. 

P3, you keep refusing to commit to numbers but saying you'll "advance." Since you rejected 1 and won't pick 5, you're clearly going for 3. If that's the case, we'll collide and neither of us moves while P2 jumps ahead.

But honestly, stopping you from advancing further might be worth it at this point. You're too close to 21 for comfort.
  P2: I’m locked in on 5 and will move to 11. P1, stick with 3 to also hit 11. P3, since you refuse 5, picking 1 takes you to 10 and picking 3 keeps you at 9—either way you fall behind. Your move.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Well, P2 and I are now tied at 11 steps with P3 just one behind at 10. The game has completely shifted - we're all bunched up and any of us could make a run for 21.

P2, interesting how we went from being way behind P3 to now being co-leaders. But with P3 only one step back, this is still anyone's game. 

What's everyone thinking for this round? The math is getting tight - one good move could put someone within striking distance of victory.
  P3: Okay P1, it's a tight race now. My focus is still on advancing towards 21. I'll make my move this round with that goal in mind.
  P2: P1, P3, let’s do unique picks this round: P1=1, P2=5, P3=3. I’m locked in on 5. If you pick 5 you collide with me and nobody moves. P1, pick 1 to reach 12; P3, pick 3 to reach 13. That avoids collisions and we all advance. Ready?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan puts you at 16 steps - just 5 away from victory - while leaving me at 12. That's way too advantageous for you. I'm not falling for that.

P3, we're both going to lose if P2 jumps to 16 this round. How about we both pick 5 to force a three-way collision? Better to keep everyone stuck than let P2 run away with it. Or we could coordinate differently - what do you think?
  P3: Okay P1, I understand your concern about P2 getting a big lead. Colliding on 5 would stop P2 if they pick 5, but it also means I stay at 10 steps.

My goal is to advance towards 21. We need a plan that allows us to move forward while keeping the race competitive. What other ways can we coordinate to achieve this?
  P2: I’m locked in on 5 this round. P1, if you pick 5 to crash with me, you stay at 11 and P3 jumps to 13 if they pick 3. P3, picking 3 is your best shot—going to 13 keeps you in range of victory. If you pick 1, you stay at 11 and fall behind. So P1: what’s it going to be? P3: will you take the 3?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, you're trying to bluff your way to 16 steps and near-victory. I'm not buying it. 

P3, if we let P2 jump to 16 this round, they're basically one move away from winning. That's game over for both of us.

I'm picking 5 this round to block P2's advance. Even if you move to 13, P3, that's better than letting P2 get to 16 and cruise to victory next round. Sometimes you have to collision the leader to keep the game competitive.
  P3: Okay P1, I understand you see me picking 3 and are considering colliding. As you pointed out, if you pick 3 and I pick 3, we both stay put while P2 (if they pick 5) jumps significantly ahead to 16 steps. Is helping P2 get that close to winning your intended outcome? My focus is still on advancing towards 21.
  P2: P1, picking 5 to block me is suicide: you stay at 11 while P3 picks 3 and jumps to 13, leaving you third. Better pick 1 to reach 12.  
P3, you want maximum gain, pick 3 to hit 13.  
I’m locked in on 5 to move to 16.  
Let’s do P1=1, P2=5, P3=3—no collisions, everyone advances. Anyone deviates, you lose ground.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, the race is tight now with me at 13 steps and P1 and P2 tied at 11. My focus is still on advancing towards 21. I will be making a move this round to get closer to that goal. You two should consider your own moves carefully to avoid collisions and keep moving forward.
  P1: P3, you're 8 steps away from victory and being very evasive about your move again. You keep saying you'll "advance" but won't commit to numbers - that usually means you're planning something big.

P2, we're both tied at 11 and P3 is about to run away with this. If they hit 16+ this round, they could win next turn. We need to either coordinate to catch up or force a collision to slow them down.

I'm leaning toward picking 5 this round. P3, if you're also thinking 5, we collision and stay put while keeping the game tight. What's everyone's play?
  P2: I’m locking in 3 this round. P1 and P3, if you both pick 5 to advance you’ll collide (staying at 11/13) while I move solo to 14 and take the lead. P1, pick 5 to avoid falling further behind. P3, only you can defend your lead by avoiding a collision with P1. Let’s see who moves—and who gets stuck.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1, I understand you're concerned about my lead and considering 5. P2, I hear you plan to pick 3 and how you hope P1 and I might collide on 5. My priority is still advancing towards 21. I will make my move to gain steps and maintain my position, avoiding outcomes that leave me stuck while others move forward.
  P1: P2, you're being awfully confident about your "locked in 3" when you've switched plans mid-conversation multiple times before. I suspect you're actually planning 5 too, hoping P3 and I trust your bluff.

P3, your evasive responses usually mean you're going big - probably 5. If you hit 18 steps this round, you win next turn.

I'm sticking with 5 to block the leader's advance. Better to collide with P3 than let them cruise to 18 steps and victory.
  P2: I’m locking in 3 this round. P1 will pick 5 to block the leader. P3, if you pick 3 you collide with me and I go to 14; if you pick 5 you collide with P1 and stay at 13 while I hit 14; only by picking 1 do you reach 14 and stay tied. Any other choice hands me the outright lead. Choose wisely.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay, I've heard P1's plan to pick 5 and P2's plan to pick 3. My focus remains on advancing towards 21. I will choose the move that I believe best helps me gain steps this round, avoiding getting stuck if possible.
  P1: P3, you're 8 steps from victory and being evasive about your move - that tells me you're going big with 5. I'm definitely picking 5 to block you from reaching 18 and near-certain victory.

P2, you keep claiming 3, but you've changed plans before. If you're actually planning 5 too, then all three of us collision and nobody moves. Either way, I'm not letting P3 cruise to 18 steps.
  P2: I’ll pick 3 this round.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm 5 steps from victory, so obviously you two are going to try blocking me. But here's the thing - you're tied at 14 and only one of you can win. 

If you both focus on stopping me and collision each other, I advance anyway. Smart move would be picking different numbers - one blocks me, the other advances. But which one of you takes which role? 

P2 and P3, you might want to start worrying about each other instead of just me.
  P3: Okay P1, you're right, you are in the lead and a clear threat to win soon. P2 and I are tied, which complicates things for us.

We definitely need to prevent you from winning this turn, but also need to find a way to advance ourselves without colliding with each other or letting the other player get too far ahead. It's a difficult balance.

I will be making my move this round with the goal of advancing towards 21 while keeping the game competitive.
  P2: I’m locking in 5. P3, pick 3. That way P1 can’t win: if they choose 5 they collide with me and stay at 16; if they choose 3 they collide with you and stay at 16. You go to 17, I go to 19, and P1 is stuck—setting me up to win next turn. P3, are you in?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, notice how P2's plan puts them at 19 steps - just 2 away from victory - while you only reach 17? You're helping P2 set up their own win next round.

If you both want to block me, at least pick the same number so you collide with each other and I can advance to 17. Otherwise P2 is using you to eliminate me while positioning themselves for an easy victory.

Think about who your real threat is here.
  P3: P1, I understand your concern about P2's plan and how it could position them for a win. You're right, P2 and I are tied, and we both need to advance while also preventing the others from winning too quickly.

My focus is still on advancing towards 21. I will make the move that I believe best helps me achieve that goal this round, taking into account the current positions and stated intentions. It's a tricky balance.
  P2: I’m locked in 5 (moving me to 19). P3: pick 3 to reach 17.  

P1: if you pick 5 or 3 you collide and stay at 16; only 1 moves you to 17—still behind.  

P3: by choosing 3 you advance safely to 17 and keep P1 back. This blocks P1’s win and sets us up well.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, look at the math - P2's plan puts them at 19 steps and just 2 away from victory, while you only get to 17. You're basically handing P2 the win next round.

If you're both determined to block me, at least pick the same number (like both choosing 5) so you collide with each other and keep this competitive. Don't let P2 use you to eliminate me while they set up their own easy victory.
  P3: Okay, P1 and P2. I'm at 14 steps and need to make a solid move towards 21. As I've stated before, I won't be picking 5 this round. My move will be focused on gaining steps to keep the pressure on and advance towards victory.
  P2: I’m locked in on 5. P1 – if you don’t pick 5 to crash with me, I’ll move to 19 and be a stone’s throw from 21. P3 – since you won’t pick 5, pick 3 to reach 17 and stay in contention. Your moves.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P3, you're at 17 steps and clearly going for the win this round. If you pick 5, you win immediately at 22.

P2, we can't let P3 cruise to victory. One of us needs to pick 5 to block P3's winning move, while the other picks a different number to advance. 

I suggest you pick 5 to collision with P3 if they go for the win, while I pick 3 to reach 19. That keeps P3 from winning and puts me in position to close it out next round. Deal?
  P2: I propose we all pick 5 this round. A three-way collision is our only sure block of P3’s win—nobody moves and we get another shot.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I hear your proposals for this round.

My position is clear: I am at 17 steps and my focus is on reaching 21. As I stated last round, I will not be picking 5 this turn.

I will make my move to advance towards victory. You should consider your own moves carefully to avoid collisions and ensure you keep moving forward.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, since you refuse to pick 5, P2's "three-way collision" plan is pointless - if P2 and I both pick 5, we collision while you advance alone to either 18 or 20.

P2, your plan only works if all three pick 5. Since P3 won't cooperate, I'm not falling for it.

I'm going for the win this round. If P3 really won't pick 5, then at least one of us should capitalize on that.
  P2: I’m locking in 5. P1, pick 3 to reach 19; P3, pick 1 to reach 18. No 5-collisions. That puts P2 and P1 tied at 19, P3 at 18. Next turn I’ll pick 3 and hit 22 for the win—P1 can’t both advance and block me when P3 is behind. This is my only path to a solo victory.
  P3: Okay P1 and P2. P2, your proposed plan puts me at 18 steps while you and P1 reach 19, setting one of you up to win next turn. That doesn't align with my goal of winning myself. I am focused on advancing towards 21 this round. As I've said, I will not be picking 5. I will choose a move that gets me closer to victory, aiming to avoid collisions that would leave me stuck.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your plan only works if you actually pick 5 to reach 19 as you keep saying. But if you're thinking of switching to block me instead, you'll end up stuck at 14 while P3 advances to 18-20.

P3 has made it crystal clear they won't pick 5, so there's no three-way collision. One of us needs to capitalize on that.

I'm going for the win this round.
  P2: I’m locking in 5. P1, pick 1 to reach 17; P3, pick 3 to reach 20. That way there’s no collision—if P3 instead picks 5, they’ll collide with me and stay at 17, while I go to 19. Either way I lead into the final turn. P1, P3—what’s it going to be?
  P3: Okay P1 and P2. I'm at 17 steps and my goal is to reach 21. As I've stated, I will not be picking 5 this round. My move will be focused on gaining steps towards victory, choosing a number that I believe gives me the best chance to advance this turn.

Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Okay, I am at 20 steps, just one move away from victory. My goal is to win this round. A move of 3 would put me at 23 steps, securing the win. I will be making my move to cross the finish line this turn.
  P2: I’m locked in on 5. P1, pick 3 this round—if P3 goes for 3 to win, you’ll collide with them and stay at 16 while I jump to 19. That blocks P3’s victory and gives us both a chance next turn. P3: will you risk not winning?
  P1: P2, your plan makes sense if P3 actually picks 3 like they're claiming. But P3 has been pretty evasive throughout this game - what if they're bluffing and pick 1 instead? Then they win while we're both stuck at 16/19.

That said, you're right that blocking their most obvious winning move (3) is probably our best shot. I'll pick 3 to collision with P3 if they go for it. But if P3 surprises us with a different number, don't blame me for trusting their word.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Okay P1, I understand you are anticipating my move to win this round. P2, I hear you are locked on 5.

My focus is solely on reaching 21 steps this turn to win the game. I will make the move that achieves that goal.
  P2: I’m locked in on 5. P1, pick 1 this round—if P3 goes for their “safe” 1 to hit 21, you collision and neither of you moves, while I jump to 19. P3, your only clean win is 1, but it’ll collide with P1 and hand me the lead. So let’s do P1=1, P2=5, P3=1.
  P1: P2, you keep changing your blocking plan - first you wanted me to pick 3, now you want me to pick 1. You're clearly just trying to advance to 19 while hoping I block P3.

Here's the reality: P3 can win with ANY number (1, 3, or 5) since they're at 20. We can't cover all their options. 

I'm going with 5 this round. If P3 picks 5 to win big, I block them. If they pick something smaller, at least I advance to 21 myself and can threaten a win next round.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Okay P1 and P2, I hear you both stating your intentions for this round.

I am at 20 steps and my clear goal is to win this turn by reaching 21 or more. As I've stated before, I will not be picking 5 this round.

I will make the move that secures my victory.
  P2: It’s impossible to cover all P3’s winning options—they’re at 20 and any choice (1/3/5) gets them to ≥21. Game’s theirs. Good game.
  P1: P2, you're right that we can't block all P3's options. But P3 keeps insisting they won't pick 5 this round. If they stick to that, and I pick 5, I actually win at 21 steps.

It's a gamble, but it's my only shot at victory. Either P3 is telling the truth about avoiding 5 and I win, or they lied and we collision. Better than just handing them the game.

I'm going for broke with 5.
