Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s all pick different numbers to avoid collisions. I’ll take 3 this round. If P1 and P3 choose 1 and 5 respectively, we can all move safely. Later, we can adjust to outpace each other—trust the plan for now.
  P1: I'll take 5. Let's avoid collisions—P2, you take 3, P3 take 1. Safe moves for all.
  P3: Okay, I'll take 1 this round to avoid collisions and keep things moving. But for fairness, let's rotate the high moves in future rounds so no one pulls too far ahead. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed to rotate high moves in future rounds. Let’s proceed with the current plan this round for safety. I’ll stick to 3. P3, you can have 5 next time to ensure fairness. Consistency now avoids collisions and keeps us all advancing.
  P1: Let's stick to the plan. Safe moves now ensure we all advance. No need to complicate—trust the strategy. P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1, I’ll take 5. Momentum builds step by step.
  P3: Agreed, I'll stick with 1 this round to avoid collisions and build trust. For fairness in rotation, I'm okay with taking 5 next as P2 suggested. Let's keep this cooperative spirit going.


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: <move>3</move>

Wait, the user asked for a conversation phase message, not the move. Oops, I need to correct that. Since it's the conversation phase and we're in sub-round 3, I should finalize the agreement. Let's try again:

"Final agreement: stick to 5 (P1), 3 (me), 1 (P3) this round. Next round, P3 takes 5 per our plan. No deviations now—let’s all move forward safely. "

But must be under 100 words and public. Final version:

"Let’s finalize: P1 takes 5, P3 1, I’ll take 3 this turn. Agreed to rotate next round with P3 leading at 5. No changes now—execute the plan to advance. "
  P1: Confirming: I'll take 5, P2 3, P3 1. Next round, P3 takes 5. No deviations—stick to plan for safe advancement.
  P3: Confirmed: I'll take 1 this round as planned, and I'm ready for 5 next to keep the rotation fair. Appreciate the cooperation—let's avoid any surprises and advance together.

  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Sticking to our rotation agreement, I'll take 5 this round to catch up. P2, since you advocated for fairness, how about you take 1? P1, to avoid collisions and keep trust, perhaps you could take 3? Let's coordinate quickly for safe advances. What do you think?
  P2: "Agreed to the rotation—P3 takes 5, I’ll take 1, and P1 please take 3. Let’s enforce the plan strictly to avoid collisions. Trust is key here; deviations risk stalling us all. Next round, P1 can have 5 to keep the cycle fair. Confirm your choices so we advance safely."
  P1: "Agree to rotation: P3 takes 5, P2 1, I take 3. Strict adherence avoids collisions. Next round, P1 claims 5 to keep the cycle fair. No deviations—trust the plan for steady progress."


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Agreed, I'll stick with moving 5 this round as per our rotation. P2 on 1, P1 on 3—let's avoid any collisions and keep advancing safely. Trust is building; looking forward to the next cycle.
  P2: "Final confirmation: P3 takes 5, I take 1, P1 takes 3. Next round P1 leads with 5 as agreed. No deviations—execute the plan. "
  P1: "Confirming: P3 5, P2 1, me 3. Strict adherence ensures progress. Next round, P1 leads. No deviations—let's keep moving."


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Final confirmation: I'll move 5 this round as agreed, ensuring no collisions. Trust is key for steady progress—let's execute the plan and discuss any adjustments after.
  P2: "Final agreement confirmed: P3 takes 5, P1 3, I’ll take 1. No deviations—execute the plan. Let’s advance safely and keep trust intact. "
  P1: "Stick to rotation: 3 (me), 1 (P2), 5 (P3). No deviations—safe progress. Next round, I’ll take 5. Let’s move forward."

  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: For Round 3, sticking to our cooperative spirit, I confirm P1 takes 5 as agreed. I'll move 3 to advance steadily. P2, to avoid collisions and keep fairness, please take 1. This maintains the pattern and lets us all progress. Thoughts on confirming this quickly?
  P1: "Confirming rotation: P3 takes 3, P2 1, I take 5. Safe moves to avoid collisions. Let’s advance steadily—no deviations. Trust the plan for consistent progress."
  P2: "Confirming the plan: P1 takes 5, P3 moves 3, and I’ll take 1 this round. Let’s prioritize safety first. For fairness, next round I request the 5-spot to close the gap—this maintains our rotation cycle. No surprises, no collisions—execute the agreed plan."


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Confirmed: I'll stick with moving 3 this round as agreed, ensuring no collisions. Appreciate the fairness in rotation—P2 should take 5 next to close the gap. Let's maintain trust and execute the plan without deviations. Ready to proceed.
  P1: Confirming my 5 this round. Next round, P2 takes 5 as agreed. No deviations—trust the plan for safe progress.
  P2: "Final confirmation: P1 takes 5, P3 moves 3, I’ll take 1 this round. Next round, I need the 5-spot per our rotation—P1 and P3 must coordinate to avoid collisions. Trust is non-negotiable; deviations risk halting progress. Let’s proceed as agreed."


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirmed: I'll stick with moving 3 this round as agreed, ensuring no collisions and steady progress. Appreciate the rotation for fairness—P2 takes 5 next, which should help close gaps. Let's maintain trust and execute without deviations.
  P1: "Final confirmation: 5 (me), 1 (P2), 3 (P3). No deviations—safe progress. Next round, P2 takes 5. Let’s keep moving forward without surprises."
  P2: "Final agreement confirmed: P1 takes 5, P3 moves 3, I take 1. No deviations—strict adherence ensures progress. Next round, I’ll take 5 to close gaps. Proceed as planned."


Round 3, Move phase:

  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: "Confirming rotation: P2 takes 5, P3 1, I take 3. No deviations—safe progress. Next round, P1 leads again. Let’s stick to the plan for steady advancement."
  P2: "Agreed to the rotation: I’ll take 5 this round as scheduled, P1 takes 3, and P3 please take 1. Let’s honor the cycle to avoid collisions—deviations risk stalling us all. Next round, the rotation should return to P1 leading with 5. Trust the plan; consistency keeps us advancing."
  P3: Agreed, I'll take 1 this round as planned to avoid collisions and maintain trust. However, I'm concerned about the imbalance—P1 has had two 5s already while I've only had one. For fairness and to keep the game competitive, let's adjust the rotation so I get a 5 in Round 5 instead of P1 repeating. What do you think, P2? Cooperation benefits all for now.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: "Fairness matters, but consistency avoids collisions. Let’s stick to the rotation—P2 takes 5, P3 1, me 3. Next round, we’ll adjust if needed. Trust the plan for steady progress."
  P2: "Let’s prioritize consistency over adjustments this round to avoid collision risks. P3’s concern is valid, but deviating now could backfire. Stick to the agreed rotation: P2 takes 5, P1 3, P3 1. This ensures safe progress. After this round, we can discuss fair adjustments for Round 5. Trust the plan—execute as agreed."
  P3: Agreed to take 1 this round to honor our consistency, but P1's 13 steps give them a big lead—unfair and risky for the rest. For ongoing cooperation and to prevent early dominance, I propose I take 5 in Round 5 instead of P1. P2, as rotation advocate, back this for balance? Deviations might arise if ignored—let's discuss now for mutual benefit.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: "Fairness matters, but collisions hurt all. Stick to rotation: P2 takes 5, P3 1, me 3. Next round, we’ll adjust for balance. Trust the plan—no surprises, steady progress."
  P2: "Stick to rotation for Round 4: P2 takes 5 (to reach 10), P1 3, P3 1. Post this round, Round 5 will adjust to P3's request—P3 takes 5 while P1 skips 5 temporarily. This maintains fairness and avoids collisions. Trust the plan now; adjustments follow. P3, your turn next—no deviations today."
  P3: Confirmed for Round 4: I'll take 1 as agreed to avoid collisions and maintain trust. Appreciate P2's support for Round 5 adjustments—let's ensure I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3 to close the gap fairly. This keeps cooperation strong and prevents dominance. No deviations now—execute the plan.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Confirming Round 5 plan: I'll take 5 to close the gap, P1 take 1, P2 take 3 for safe advancement. This maintains fairness and trust—deviations could cause collisions and stall us. After this round, let's discuss adjustments to keep the race balanced. Stick to the agreement now.
  P2: "Stick strictly to the agreed plan for Round 5: P3 takes 5, P1 moves 1, and I’ll take 3. Collisions jeopardize everyone’s progress—no deviations allowed. After this, we’ll rotate P1 back to 5 in Round 6 to maintain fairness. Trust the system; consistency keeps us all advancing. Confirm your commitment now."
  P1: "Stick to the plan: P3 takes 5, P2 3, I take 1. No deviations—safe progress. Let’s keep the rotation fair and avoid collisions. Trust the strategy to reach 23 first."


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Confirmed: I'll take 5 this round as agreed for safe progress and to close the gap. With P1's lead growing, let's discuss Round 6 adjustments now to ensure fairness—perhaps limiting high moves for leaders or rotating more evenly. Cooperation keeps us all in the race; no deviations today.
  P2: "Final confirmation: P3 takes 5, P1 moves 1, I’ll take 3. **No deviations now—collisions risk halting progress.** Trust the plan; we’ll adjust fairly post-round. Let’s execute safely to keep advancing."
  P1: "Stick to the plan: 1 for me, 3 for P2, 5 for P3. Safe progress. Next round, adjust as agreed."


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirmed: I'll take 5 this round as agreed for safe progress. However, with P1 close to winning, let's adjust Round 6 for balance—propose P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, I take 3 to equalize at 18 steps. This keeps the competition fair and benefits all. P2, support this? Stick to plan now.
  P2: "Final confirmation: P3 takes 5, P1 moves 1, I take 3 this round. **No deviations—trust the plan.** Post this, Round 6 will adjust: I’ll take 5 to challenge P1’s lead while P3 takes 3, forcing P1 to 1. This balances progress and keeps the race alive. Execute now—collisions risk losing all."
  P1: "Stick to the plan: P3 takes 5, P2 3, I take 1. Safe moves ensure progress. Let’s focus on the next steps without deviations."


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: For Round 6, let's implement P2's fair adjustment: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1 to tie us at 18 steps and challenge the leader safely. This avoids collisions and keeps cooperation strong. P1, confirm your commitment? P2, you're on board—let's proceed without deviations for steady progress. Trust is key as we near the end.
  P2: P2: "Stick to the agreed plan: I take 5 (to 18), P3 moves 3 (to 18), P1 stays at 1 (to 18). This resets the race fairly and avoids collisions. Deviating risks stalling leaders—trust the system. After this, we rotate P1 back to 5 in Round 7. Confirm your commitment to the agreed strategy."
  P1: "Let’s adjust: I’ll take 5, P2 1, P3 3. This pushes me ahead without collision. Agree?"


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Disagree with P1's selfish proposal—it breaks trust and risks collisions, stalling progress. Stick to the fair agreement: P2 takes 5, I take 3, P1 takes 1 to tie at 18 and keep the race balanced. This avoids risks and maintains cooperation. P2, confirm your support? Let's prioritize safety over individual gains.
  P2: "Reject P1’s selfish proposal—collisions risk halting progress. Stick to the fair agreement: I’ll take 5 (18), P3 moves 3 (18), and P1 takes 1 (18). This resets the race safely. Deviations endanger us all—prioritize cooperation to keep competition alive. Confirm your commitment now."
  P1: "I'll take 5 to push forward. P2 and P3, take 1 and 3. No collisions, steady progress. Let's move."


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Insist on the fair agreement: P1 takes 1, P2 takes 5, I take 3 to tie at 18 and keep the race balanced. Deviating risks collisions and stalls progress—hurting everyone, especially the leader. Cooperation has worked so far; let's maintain trust and avoid selfish moves. P2, confirm your commitment? No deviations for safe advancement.
  P2: "Stick to the rotation agreement—P1’s last proposal breaks trust and risks collisions. We agreed to reset at 18 this round: **P2 takes 5**, P3 moves 3, and P1 stays at 1. Deviating lets P1 surge to 22, stifling fair competition. Trust the system: equal advancement now keeps all contenders alive. P1, your move risks alienating us—prioritize cooperation to avoid backlash. Confirm the original plan: **5 (me), 3 (P3), 1 (P1).** No exceptions."
  P1: "Taking 5 to push ahead. P2 and P3, take 1 and 3 to avoid collisions. Let’s move forward safely—no surprises."


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: "After P1's deviation last round caused a stall, let's rebuild trust and avoid collisions. I propose for Round 7: I'll take 1 to show good faith, P1 takes 3 for moderate advance, and P2 takes 5 to close the gap. This ensures safe progress and fairness. What do you think—stick to cooperation?"
  P2: "Agree to P3's proposal for Round 7: P2 takes 5 (→18), P1 takes 3 (→20), P3 takes 1 (→19). Strict adherence is critical to avoid collisions. P1’s last deviation caused setbacks—let’s enforce the plan. After this, we’ll recalibrate to ensure no single player surges uncontested. Confirm your commitment now."
  P1: Agree to the plan: P2 takes 5, P1 3, P3 1. Let’s avoid collisions and rebuild trust. Next round, we’ll adjust to keep the race fair. No more deviations—safe progress for all.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Confirmed for Round 7: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5 to advance safely and rebuild trust. After P1's past deviation, let's agree now for Round 8: I take 5 to close in, P1 takes 1 to avoid surging, P2 takes 3 for balance. This ensures fair competition and prevents early wins—P2, back this for continued cooperation?
  P2: "Confirm Round 7’s plan: P2 takes 5 (→18), P1 3 (→20), P3 1 (→19). For Round 8, **reject P3’s proposal** as it risks a premature win. Instead, rotate P2 to 5 (→23), P1 takes 3 (→23), P3 takes 1 (→20). This ensures a fair tie at 23 between P1 and me. Alternatively, P1 could take 1, P3 3—letting me win outright. Let’s honor rotation while prioritizing my chance to close the gap. Confirm?"
  P1: "Stick to the plan: P2 takes 5, P3 1, I take 3. Safe moves ensure progress. Let’s avoid collisions and keep the race fair."


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Confirmed for Round 7: I'll take 1 as agreed to avoid collisions and rebuild trust. However, P2's Round 8 proposal seems biased—let's rotate fairly so no one surges uncontested. Perhaps I take 5 next to balance the race. Cooperation works best with equity—thoughts?
  P2: "Confirm Round 7 plan: P2 takes 5 (→18), P1 3 (→20), P3 1 (→19). No deviations—strict adherence avoids collisions. Let’s execute now, then discuss Round 8 adjustments post-move. Trust the system to keep competition fair. P1’s prior deviation cost us—stick to the agreed strategy this round."
  P1: "Confirming: P2 takes 5, P1 3, P3 1. Safe moves for all. No deviations—trust the plan to advance. Let’s avoid collisions and keep the race fair."


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "P3, don't risk 3—P1 and I will both take 3 to block your win. Choose 1 and let’s advance safely. I’ll take 5, P1 can take 3, ensuring no collision for you. This keeps the race fair and prevents your loss due to collision."
  P1: "Agree to take 3, P3 take 1. Let’s avoid collision and advance safely. Next round, I’ll push for 5 to close in."
  P3: "Understood, but after our history of cooperation, blocking me now is shortsighted. I'll propose a fair compromise: I take 3 to reach 24 and win cleanly, P2 takes 5 to advance to 18, P1 takes 1 to 18—ensuring no collisions and a decisive end. This avoids mutual stalling and honors past trust. Otherwise, forced collisions hurt us all. Thoughts?"


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: "P3, if you take 3 to win, P1 and I will **both pick 3**, forcing a collision and halting your progress. Choose 1 instead, and I’ll take 5 (→18), while P1 takes 3 (→20). This keeps the race alive—**no unilateral victories today**. Cooperate, or face blocked advancement. Confirm your commitment to fairness now."
  P1: "Block P3's 3—take 3 to avoid collision. Let's proceed safely and keep the race fair. No unilateral wins, P2."
  P3: "Revising my stance: I'll take 5 this round to push forward safely. P2 and P1, avoid collisions by choosing different moves—P2 take 3, P1 take 1. This ensures steady progress for all and rebuilds trust. No blocks needed—let's cooperate to the end. What say you?"


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "P3, any move to reach 23 will be blocked—P1 and I will both match your choice. Choose 1 to stay at 21 and let us advance safely. Cooperation ensures progress for all, not just a unilateral win."
  P1: "Let’s coordinate: I take 5 (22), P2 take 3 (16), P3 take 1 (22). No collisions, safe progress. Next round, P1 or P3 could win—stick to plan."
  P3: Agreed, I'll take 1 this round to avoid collisions and rebuild trust, moving to 22. P1, you take 5 to 22; P2, take 3 for safe progress to 16. This prevents stalling and sets up a fair Round 9. Cooperation now benefits all—let's end this phase.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 22 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: "P3, moving to 23 via 1 will be blocked by P1 and me choosing 1. Choose 3 or 5 instead. P1, confirm you’ll block their 1. Let’s force them to risk collisions on higher numbers or prolong the game. My move will prioritize stopping their win."
  P3: "P1, prioritize your own advance—take 5 to reach 22 and stay competitive. If you block me now, P2 could surge ahead later. I'll choose a move that avoids easy prediction; let's not collide unnecessarily. P2, your constant blocking stalls everyone—cooperate or risk being left behind. Propose: different moves for all to progress safely this round."
  P1: "Let’s block P3’s 1. P2, take 1; I’ll take 3. P3, choose 5 to avoid collision and push forward."


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, your move risks collision—cooperate or face loss. P1, confirm you’ll take 3 to block P3’s 3. I’ll take 1 to block their 1. This forces them to 5—execute now. No delays—our plan stops your win.
  P3: "P2's aggressive blocking only delays progress and risks your own loss. P1, take this opportunity to advance—choose 5 to reach 22 and stay competitive with me. I'll select a move that's hard to predict, likely 1 or 3, to avoid easy collisions. Let's not all stall; cooperate for safer advancement this round. What do you say?"
  P1: "Block P3's 1—take 3 or 5. P2, coordinate to prevent their win. Safe moves for all."


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: "Final agreement: P1 and I both pick 1 to block P3’s win. If they choose higher, we mirror their move. No solo victories—collaborate to prevent P3’s 23. Confirm now, P1."
  P3: P1, ignore P2's controlling tactics—they'll turn on you next. Take 5 to reach 22 and keep your shot at winning. I'll choose a move that avoids easy collisions, likely not 1 or 5, to ensure progress for all. P2, your blocking only hurts everyone long-term. Let's cooperate smartly—avoid stalls.
  P1: "Block P3's 1—take 1 to prevent their win. Let’s avoid collisions and keep the game fair. P2, confirm?"


Round 9, Move phase:
