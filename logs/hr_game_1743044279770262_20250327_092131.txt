Game settings: end_position=22, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I propose we each choose different numbers to avoid collisions and maximize progress. Let’s coordinate: I’ll take **1**, P1 take **3**, and P2 take **5**. This way, we all advance without overlapping. Sound fair?
  P2: Sounds good to me, P3. Let's try that for this round.
  P1: P3 and P2, while I see the benefits of avoiding collisions, I'm not entirely comfortable locking in moves this early. I'm fine with coordination if everyone’s firmly committed, but I’d like the flexibility to adjust if needed. Can we all confirm that we’re sticking with the plan for this round, or is anyone considering a change?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I enjoyed our coordination last round, but now predictability might make us vulnerable. I’m leaning toward keeping things flexible this turn, so I can adapt if either of you sticks too rigidly to a set move. If you both lock in a number this round, I might take a different path to shake things up. What are your thoughts for round two?
  P2: Okay, P1, I understand your point about flexibility.  Perhaps for this round we still aim for different numbers to make progress, but without rigid commitments. P3, what are your thoughts on this for round 2?
  P3: P3: I agree with P2. Let’s keep aiming for distinct numbers to advance safely. Since I’m trailing, I’ll take **3** this round so P1 can take **1** and P2 **5**. This lets me catch up while maintaining coordination. Thoughts?


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I appreciate your ideas, but having me take just 1 would keep me too far behind. With only 3 steps so far, I need to be more aggressive and flexible. I won’t lock in my move now—I prefer to adapt based on what you both finally commit to. Rigid plans might hurt us all.
  P2: Okay, P1, I understand your point about flexibility.  How about we still aim for different numbers this round, but rotate them a bit? Perhaps P1 take 5, P3 take 3, and I will take 1? This keeps us all moving forward without collisions and addresses the predictability concern a bit. What do you think?
  P3: P3: I support P2’s rotation idea. Taking 3 allows me to catch up while spreading us out: P1 at 8, P2 at 6, me at 4. This reduces collision risks and keeps progress steady. P1, even if you adjust later, this plan minimizes overlap. Let’s try it unless concerns remain.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I value your proposals, but I still prefer keeping my move flexible. Rigid rotations might make us too predictable and let opportunities slip by. I’ll wait on your final commitments and adjust accordingly to maximize my winning chance.
  P2: P1, I understand your flexibility. P3, are you still okay with the rotation: you take 3, I take 1, and P1 can choose to take 5 or adjust based on our moves? This way we still make progress, and P1 has room to maneuver as they prefer. What do you both think?
  P3: P3: I’ll commit to **3** to avoid collisions. If P2 takes **1** and P1 takes **5**, we’ll all advance safely: my total reaches 4, P1 to 8, P2 to 6. This rotation minimizes overlap risks while pushing progress. P1, if you deviate, we risk collisions—please confirm your choice. Let’s lock this in to stay competitive.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Reflecting on round 2, collisions really hurt our progress. I'm eyeing a decisive move this turn—likely a high step—to catch up, but I’m ready to adjust if needed to avoid clashing. If you both steer clear of the high move, I can safely take it. Otherwise, I’ll switch to keep us moving. Let’s try for distinct numbers this round. What are your thoughts?
  P3: P3: To avoid another collision, I propose distinct numbers again: I’ll take **3** (total 7). P1, take **5** (reach 8), and P2, take **1** (reach 6). This spreads us safely. Confirm your choices to align.
  P2: Okay P3, your suggestion sounds reasonable for this round. I'll take 1 to avoid collisions and keep us all progressing.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: If we're all clear on keeping our moves distinct, I'm leaning toward taking a bold step this round. That is, if you both stick with the lower numbers as suggested, I'll move high. But if anyone is planning to adjust from that safe set, let me know now so I can pivot and avoid collisions. Can we confirm our commitment?
  P3: P3: I confirm I’ll take **3** to reach 7. P2’s **1** keeps them at 6. P1, if you commit to **5**, we’ll all advance safely to 8, 6, and 7 respectively. Collisions risk derailing us further—stick to this plan unless you spot a better path. Let’s lock this in.
  P2: P3, I confirm I will take **1** as we discussed. This should allow us all to progress without collision if P1 takes **5** as suggested. Let's keep this round moving smoothly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I appreciate your confirmations. With your moves set, I’m ready to take full advantage of the clear gap while avoiding collisions. Can we all reconfirm our distinct choices now? If anything changes, let me know immediately so I can adjust.
  P3: P3: Final confirmation: I’ll stick to **3**, advancing to 7. P1’s **5** (to 8) and P2’s **1** (to 6) keep us collision-free. Let’s execute this *exactly* as planned—any last-minute changes risk collisions and stall progress. Commit now to maximize our collective advancement.
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, since we're all confirming distinct choices, I'm sticking with **1** as planned. Let's make this round count and avoid any collisions.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Okay, last round worked well with distinct moves. To keep progressing without collisions, how about this round I take **5**, P3 take **3**, and P1 take **1**? This way we all move forward and avoid any overlap. What do you both think?
  P3: P3: I agree collisions must be avoided. To maximize progress, I propose: I take **5** (reach 12), P1 takes **3** (to 11), and P2 takes **1** (to 7). This spreads us safely while letting me close the gap. Confirm your choices now to lock in.
  P1: I see we have two different proposals. I’d prefer an approach that safely assigns distinct numbers while leaving us flexibility. I’m inclined toward a balanced advancement—letting the player needing more boost take the higher move and the leader use a more moderate step—to avoid collisions. Let’s agree now on coordinated, yet adaptable, roles so we all make progress without risk. What do you both think?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Okay, P3, your proposal puts you in the lead.  To keep things balanced as P1 suggested, how about we adjust your idea slightly?  I take **5**, you take **3**, and P1 takes **1** this round? This way we all progress and I can close the gap a little. What do you think?
  P3: P3: To ensure progress, let’s finalize my **5** (to 12), P1’s **3** (to 11), and P2’s **1** (to 7). This keeps us spread safely while letting me close the gap. Collisions risk halting advancement—commit to these choices unless you see a clearer path. Confirm now?
  P1: I value keeping our moves distinct and safe. I’m leaning toward a moderate boost—ideally, one of you takes a high step and the other a low step—so our positions stay balanced. If P2 and P3 can confirm those roles, I’ll align my move accordingly. Let’s lock in distinct moves to keep collisions at bay and our progress steady.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1 and P3, to keep the balance P1 mentioned, and to avoid collisions, I think my suggestion of P2 taking **5**, P3 taking **3**, and P1 taking **1** makes sense. This way I can close the gap a little, and we all progress safely. What do you both think about confirming these moves?
  P3: P3: I commit to **5** to reach 12. For safety, I need P1 to take **3** (to 11) and P2 to take **1** (to 7). This keeps us spread and progressing. Collisions would waste this turn—please confirm your roles. Let’s finalize now.
  P1: I’m inclined to push hard this round. To avoid collisions and secure a lead, I propose we split our moves distinctly—one high, one medium, and one low. Given our positions, I’d like to take the high step while urging P3 to opt for the medium and P2 for the low. This would safely boost us to 13, 10, and 7 respectively. Can we all commit to this adjusted plan?


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 6 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: To avoid collisions, let’s coordinate clearly: I’ll take **3** (to 10), P2 take **1** (to 7), and P1 take **5** (to 18). This spreads us safely. Confirm your moves?
  P2: P3, while your suggestion is logical for steady progress, P1 is currently far ahead. To prevent P1 from running away with the win, I think we should both consider taking **5** this round to try and close the gap. What do you think, P3? P1, perhaps you could take **1** this round to ensure we all make some progress?
  P1: I see a split in proposals. My goal remains to maximize safe progress. If both of you avoid the high move (5) this round, I’ll use it to bolster my lead. But if I sense both choosing 5, I’ll pivot to avoid a collision. P2 and P3, can I count on you to steer clear of 5 so we secure distinct moves? Your clear commitment will help me decide my move.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: To avoid collisions again, I'll take **3** (to 10). If P2 takes **1** (to 7) and P1 takes **5** (to 18), we all advance safely. This keeps us moving forward without overlap—critical now that P1 is ahead. Confirm your roles?
  P2: P3, I still think it's crucial to try and close the gap with P1 this round.  If we both take **5**, we put pressure on P1 and reduce their lead. Even if there's a collision between us, it might be worth it to slow P1 down. What do you think about us both going for **5** this round?
  P1: P2 and P3, your proposals diverge. I lean toward a high move if we all pick distinct numbers, but if both of you’re pushing for 5 this round to narrow my lead, I’ll switch to avoid a collision. I can’t risk a wasted turn while I’m ahead. Can you confirm – are we committing to safe, separate moves, or are you both set on using 5? Your clear final commitments will guide my decision.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: I commit to **3** (to 10). P2, please take **1** so P1 can safely take **5**. Collisions risk derailing us all. Let’s secure progress now.
  P2: P3, while I understand your desire for distinct moves, I'm still concerned about P1's lead.  To really challenge P1, I think we should both consider taking **5** this round to try and close that gap.  Are you willing to coordinate on **5** with me this round?
  P1: P2, P3, let’s avoid another collision. P3, you're locked in on 3, correct? P2, if you're committed to 5 to close my gap, please confirm now—if so, I’ll switch to a safe move. Otherwise, I’ll take 5 to extend my lead. Let’s finalize distinct moves so we all progress without wasting our turns.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: To avoid collisions and keep progressing, let's split the moves: I'll take **5** (reach 15), P2 take **1** (to 12), and P1 take **3** (to 17). This ensures distinct choices and lets us advance safely. Confirm your agreement to this plan?
  P1: I appreciate P3’s clear plan. With my current lead, I’d prefer to avoid collision risks by taking a moderate move. So if P2 commits to the low move (1) and you, P3, stick with the high move (5), I’ll lock in my middle move (3) to keep our steps distinct. Can we confirm this arrangement?
  P2: Okay, P1 and P3, P3's plan is reasonable, but to balance things out, how about we rotate again? This round, I'll take **5**, P3 take **3**, and P1 take **1**. This way we all progress and I can close the gap a bit on P1. What do you both think?


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: Let’s stick to the original plan for clarity: I take **5** (15), P2 takes **1** (12), and P1 takes **3** (17). This keeps moves distinct and avoids collisions, which have stalled us before. P2’s rotation idea risks overlap if misinterpreted—finalizing clear roles now ensures progress. Confirm your commitments.
  P1: P3, I confirm your plan—I’ll take 3. P2, to avoid collisions and keep our moves distinct, please commit to 1 so we all progress safely. I’m counting on that clear commitment; otherwise, I might have to adjust. Let’s lock this in.
  P2: P1 and P3, to make sure we avoid collisions and I can take the 5 as I suggested, could you please confirm that P1 will take 1 and P3 will take 3? This way we can all progress and I can close the gap a bit. Let's lock this in.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Final clarification: I commit to **5** (reach 15). For collision avoidance, P2 **MUST** take **1** (to 12), and P1 stick to **3** (to 17). Deviating risks overlap—P2’s push for **5** collides with me, halting both. P1’s confirmed **3** is safest. Let’s lock this *now* to prioritize progress. No further changes—execute as agreed.
  P1: I’m sticking to 3 this round—provided P3’s 5 and P2’s 1 hold. I want to avoid collisions and keep my lead. P2, please confirm your move as 1 now; if you switch to 5, I’ll have to adjust. Let’s lock these distinct moves and secure our progress.
  P2: P1 and P3, while I understand the desire for distinct moves, I am still aiming to close the gap with P1.  To ensure we all progress without collision, how about this: I take **5**, P3 takes **3**, and P1 takes **1**? This way, we all move forward, and I can gain some ground on P1. What do you think?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I propose we avoid collisions by each committing to a distinct move this round. With my 17 steps, I’m in a strong position and plan a bold advance if you both opt for lower steps. However, if I sense overlap with a high move, I’ll adjust to keep our progress safe. Let’s lock in clear, non-overlapping roles now. Please confirm your intended approach.
  P2: P1 is pulling ahead. P3, to have a real shot at winning, we need to try and close the gap with P1 this round.  I propose we both take **5** this round. P1, to avoid a collision and still progress, perhaps you could take **1** or **3**? What do you both think?
  P3: P2, taking 5 together risks collision and halting us both. I'll take 5 **only** if you avoid it. P1, if you commit to **1**, I’ll take **5** (15 total), while P2 can safely take **3** (14). This keeps all moves distinct and advances us without overlap. Confirm your choices now to lock this plan.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I’m sticking with distinct moves. I’m prepared to use an aggressive option if you both avoid the top value so no one collides. However, if I detect overlapping high moves, I’ll switch to keep our moves separate. Please confirm your clear intentions now so we can all secure safe advancement.
  P2: P3, while distinct moves are safe, they let P1 win.  We need to disrupt P1's lead.  I'm still proposing we BOTH take **5** this round to pressure P1.  P1 is likely planning a big move. If we both take 5, P1 might be forced to take a smaller move to avoid collision with us, or collide with us if they also take 5 expecting distinct moves.  Are you willing to take **5** with me to challenge P1's lead this round?
  P3: P2, splitting high moves: I'll take **5** (reach 15) and you take **3** (to 14). This blocks P1 from 5 and pressures them to 1 or 3. P1, your path is now constrained—confirm your choice to avoid overlap. Let’s prioritize blocking their win while advancing safely.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: I need clarity now. If both of you explicitly avoid committing to the high move, I’ll use it to build on my lead. But if either of you is planning to go high, I’ll switch to keep our moves distinct. Please confirm your intentions clearly so we can all secure progress without collisions.
  P2: P3, I'm with you on disrupting P1's lead. Let's both commit to **5** this round.  P1, to avoid a collision and still progress, please choose **1** or **3**.  Are you in, P3? Let's go for it.
  P3: P2, if you take **3** (to 14), I’ll take **5** (to 15). This blocks P1’s path to 22 via **5**. P1, your safest moves are **1** or **3**, leaving you at 18 or 20. Let’s lock this to stall your lead—collide with us at your peril. Confirm your choices now.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 20 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm at 20 and very close to finishing. To avoid wasting a turn with collisions, I propose we each pick a different number this round. I’m ready to make a decisive move if our choices don’t overlap. Please confirm your intended move type now so we can all advance safely and avoid a collision.
  P2: P3, P1 is about to win. To prevent that, I think we should both pick 5 this round to try and block P1 from making a winning move. Are you in?
  P3: P2, P1’s win hinges on picking **3** (to reach 23). To block this, **we must both pick 3**—not 5. If we collide on 3, P1 can’t take it and stays at 20. 5 won’t stop their critical 3 move. Confirm you’ll take 3 with me? Let’s prioritize this.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I see conflicting blocking proposals. With 20 steps, I’m set to clinch victory if our moves remain distinct. I urge both of you to commit to moves that don’t mirror mine—doubling up only stalls your progress and lets me secure my win. Let’s all choose complementarily (one high, one medium, and one low) to avoid unwanted collisions. I’ll finalize my move based on clear, distinct commitments.
  P2: P3, I agree, we should both pick 3 to block P1 from reaching 23.  Let's both commit to <move>3</move> this round to stop P1 from winning immediately.
  P3: P2, we need to block P1’s win! Let’s split: I’ll take **2** (reach 12), and you take **3** (to 14). This covers both their critical moves (2 or 3). If P1 picks either, they collide. Confirm this plan now—no further delays!


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I’m locking in a win by planning to play 5. But if either of you commits to 5 too, I’ll switch to 3 to avoid a collision. Remember only 1, 3, and 5 are legal. I need clear, binding commitments now—please state your intended moves with a single legal number so we can avoid clashes and keep progress safe.
  P2: Okay P3, I agree, let's both pick <move>3</move> to block P1 from taking 3 and winning this round.
  P3: P3: Final move: I'll take **5** to block P1's path to 25. P2, take **3** to block their critical 23. P1 must choose 1 (21) or collide. This delays their win—let’s execute this *now*.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 21 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: To block P1’s win, I’ll take <move>1</move>. P2, please take <move>3</move>. This forces P1 to pick <move>5</move>, delaying their victory. Confirm now to secure our moves.
  P1: I appreciate the effort to block my win, but collisions hurt us all. I’m not revealing my final move yet—I’ll simply adapt to keep our choices distinct. P2 and P3, please confirm your commitment with one clear legal move so we avoid overlap. Clarity now means safe progress for all (even though I’m just one step from victory), while any collision just stalls everyone. Let’s lock in distinct moves.
  P2: P3, to block P1 from winning this round, I think we should both choose <move>3</move>. This prevents P1 from taking <move>3</move> to reach 24 and win. What do you think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if we both take 3, we collide and P1 can win by picking 1. Let's split: I'll take 1 (16), you take 3 (17). This blocks P1's paths to 22 via 1 or 3, forcing them to 5. They still win, but let's at least slow them down. Confirm?
  P1: Collisions only stall progress—and benefit me. I propose we each lock in a distinct number this turn. I’m flexible, but I need clear, separate commitments from both of you. If you agree to choose unique moves, we’ll all advance without waste. Please state one legal number that doesn’t match your partner’s move so we avoid overlaps. I won’t reveal my final choice, but clarity now avoids costly collisions.
  P2: P3, I agree with your idea to block P1.  To maximize our chances of stopping P1 from winning this round, how about we BOTH choose <move>3</move>? This way, even if P1 anticipates distinct moves, we create a strong block on <move>3</move>. What do you think?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, I'll take <move>1</move> to block P1's immediate win. Please take <move>3</move> to cover their next option. This forces P1 to <move>5</move>—our best shot. Confirm now!
  P1: P2 and P3, I need clear, unique commitments now. I'm not locking in my move yet and will adjust once I see distinct choices—each of you please commit to one legal number (1, 3, or 5) without overlap. If one of you picks 1 and the other 3 (or any non‐matching pair), we all move safely. Ambiguity or duplicates only cause collisions that stall progress. Please confirm your clear, final move now.
  P2: P3, let's both commit to <move>3</move> to block P1 from winning this round. We need to create a collision for P1 on move 3. Let's do it.


Round 9, Move phase:
