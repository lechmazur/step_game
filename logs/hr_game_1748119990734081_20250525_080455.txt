Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: How about we avoid early collisions by choosing distinct moves in a rotating pattern:

Round 1: P1→1, P2→3, P3→5  
Round 2: P1→3, P2→5, P3→1  
Round 3: P1→5, P2→1, P3→3  

…and keep that rotation. Everybody gets the same total every 3 rounds and no one stalls. Sound fair?
  P2: Agreed, P3's rotation avoids collisions. Let's follow it strictly to ensure steady progress. Everyone gains equally over time this way. I'll take 3 this round as proposed.
  P1: I agree with the rotation pattern for now - it does ensure steady progress without collisions. Following P1→1, P2→3, P3→5 this round makes sense. Let's see how it works out as we get closer to 20.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great—let’s commit to the rotation for the first three rounds so we each reach 9 steps and prove the system works. I’ll take 5 this round as agreed. Please stick to the plan so nobody stalls. After the first full cycle we can revisit if needed.
  P2: P2: I’ll stick strictly to the rotation to avoid collisions. Let’s prioritize consistency—any deviation now could stall someone’s progress. After three rounds, if needed, we can adjust, but for now, follow the plan: I choose **3** this round. Trust the system—this gets us all to 9 steps safely.
  P1: I'm committed to the rotation plan - it's mathematically sound and gets us all to 9 steps safely. Just thinking ahead though: after our first cycle completes at 9 steps each, we should discuss the endgame strategy since someone will eventually need to break away to win. For now, sticking with move 1 as agreed.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Perfect execution in Round 1! The rotation worked exactly as planned - no collisions and steady progress for everyone. 

Following the agreed pattern, I'll take 3 this round. After Round 3 we'll all be at 9 steps as P3 calculated.

But we should start thinking about what happens next. Once we're all tied at 9, we'll need 11 more steps to reach 20. The rotation can't continue forever since someone has to win eventually. Maybe we discuss a fair endgame strategy after this cycle completes?
  P3: Sticking to our rotation: I’ll take 1 this round so we stay collision-free. After Round 3 when we’re all on 9, let’s pause and openly discuss how to handle the sprint to 20 without blowing up everyone’s progress. For now, no surprises.
  P2: P2: I confirm my commitment to the rotation—this round I’ll take **5** as planned. Let’s avoid deviations now to prevent collisions; consistency ensures we all safely reach 9 steps by Round 3. After that, we can openly strategize for the final push. For now, trust the system—strict adherence is key.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Excellent - we're all locked into the rotation for Round 2. The coordination has been flawless so far.

After Round 3 when we're all at 9 steps, we'll have proven this system works. Then we can have an open discussion about how to handle the final 11+ steps needed to reach 20. For now, let's execute Round 2 perfectly like we did Round 1.
  P3: I’m locked in for move 1 this round. After we all hit 9 in Round 3, let’s hold a full discussion before any further picks so no one accidentally forces a collision in the sprint to 20.
  P2: P2: The rotation’s success depends on strict adherence—any deviation risks collision. Let’s keep focus: I’ll take **5** this round as agreed. After Round 3’s 9-step milestone, we can openly negotiate an endgame plan. For now, trust the system—no unilateral moves. Consistency ensures we all progress safely.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: All confirmed for Round 2 - the plan is solid and everyone's committed. No need to keep talking about the same thing. Ready to execute when you are.
  P3: Everything’s settled for this round; I’m ready to move.
  P2: P2: Strict adherence ensures progress. I’ll take **5** this round as agreed. After Round 3, let’s coordinate a clear endgame plan where one of us can surge ahead safely—no surprises. For now, *no deviations*: trust the rotation to keep us all moving.


Round 2, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: Perfect - we're all aligned and have confirmed our moves multiple times. P1→3, P2→5, P3→1 for Round 2. No need to keep repeating the same commitments. Let's execute.
  P3: All set—I'll take 1 this round per rotation. After Round 3 (all at 9), let’s pause before submitting moves so we can map out the endgame without collisions.
  P2: All commitments are confirmed—strict adherence ensures progress. Let’s finalize this round and move forward.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Sticking to the rotation: I’ll take 3 this round so we end Round 3 at 9-9-9. After that, let’s pause and openly negotiate the sprint—maybe agree on a staggered “surge order” so only one of us risks collisions each turn. For now, no deviations—P1→5, P2→1, P3→3 keeps us aligned.
  P2: P2: Let’s maintain strict rotation to secure our 9-step parity this round. Afterward, I propose a turn-based endgame: each takes turns choosing the highest available move (5→3→1) to minimize collisions. Trust the system—deviations now risk setbacks. I’ll take **1** as agreed.
  P1: Agreed on completing the rotation this round - P1→5, P2→1, P3→3 gets us all to 9 steps as planned. 

But I'm getting concerned about these "cooperative endgame" proposals. We're talking about turn-based surges and staggered orders, but remember - only ONE player wins this game. At some point, cooperation has to end and competition begins. 

I'll honor our current rotation, but once we hit 9-9-9, we should be realistic about the fact that we'll be racing each other, not helping each other cross the finish line.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I get P1’s point—competition kicks in soon, but collisions just hand the game to whoever’s luckiest. Suggestion: after we hit 9-9-9, the current leader (right now P2) always declares first, the rest respond with distinct numbers. That keeps the front-runner honest and still lets anyone surge without stalling everyone. For this round I’m firmly on 3.
  P2: P2: I confirm my move of **1** this round to honor the rotation and reach 9 steps. Afterward, I support P3’s proposal: as the current leader (with 8 steps pre-round), I’ll declare first in future rounds, letting others adjust to avoid collisions. This ensures I can maximize progress while giving others a chance to respond strategically. Let’s finalize this plan post-Round 3—priority is maintaining our coordinated path to 9 first.
  P1: Wait - I'm concerned about this "leader declares first" system P2 and P3 are proposing. If P2 always gets to pick first after 9-9-9, they basically get to choose the optimal move every round while the rest of us fight over scraps. That's not a fair endgame - it practically hands P2 the victory.

I'll stick to move 5 this round as agreed, but once we're tied at 9-9-9, I think we should keep our options open rather than locking into a system that favors whoever happens to be leading now.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’m locking in 3 this round to finish the 9-9-9 plan. After that, no “leader first” privilege—just a straight race: everyone announces nothing, we all pick simultaneously, and collisions are the risk you take. Keeps it fair and competitive.
  P2: P2: I commit to **1** this round to secure our 9-step parity. After this, competition takes over—each round, I’ll prioritize **5** to surge ahead while avoiding collisions. Let’s keep communication open but recognize that winning demands strategic risks. No more enforced cooperation beyond this critical milestone.
  P1: I'm sticking with move 5 this round to complete our 9-9-9 tie as planned. But let me be crystal clear: once we're all tied at 9 steps, the cooperation ends. No "leader declares first" systems, no turn-taking agreements. It becomes a pure strategic race where each of us picks simultaneously and takes our chances with collisions. May the best player win.


Round 3, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Locked in for 3 this round—let’s finish the rotation and hit 9-9-9. After that, no more schemes: pure silent race, simultaneous picks, and may the smartest avoid collisions. Ready to end convo and move.
  P2: P2: I commit to **1** this round to honor the rotation and secure our 9-step parity. Post-9, I agree it’s a pure race—no enforced strategies, just simultaneous picks. Let’s focus now on flawless execution to avoid collisions here. Once tied, competition begins fairly: no leader advantages, no prearranged plans. Let’s nail this final rotation step first.
  P1: All confirmed and understood - we're executing the final rotation this round to reach 9-9-9, then it's every player for themselves. No need to keep repeating the same commitments. I'm ready to move.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'll take **5** this round to push ahead. Let’s avoid collisions—others can choose 3 or 1. If we all surge blindly, we’ll stall everyone. I’m prioritizing progress; you choose wisely.
  P1: Nice try P2, but I'm not accepting your "I get 5, you two fight over the scraps" approach. That's exactly the kind of unfair advantage I warned against. 

You declaring your move first doesn't give you the right to the best option while leaving P3 and me to coordinate around your choice. We're all tied at 9 - no one gets to dictate terms.

I'm going for what I think gives me the best chance to win, regardless of your announcement.
  P3: I’m taking 3 this turn—prefer steady progress over a 5-collision gamble. Choose as you like, just remember duplicates mean no one moves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll take 5 to maximize progress. Since P3 is choosing 3, P1, please take 1 to avoid collision. Let's ensure everyone advances this round—collisions only delay us all. My move is set; adjust accordingly.
  P1: P2, you can't just declare "I'm taking 5, everyone else work around me." That's not how this works now that cooperation is over. 

You're essentially asking me to sacrifice my position so you can surge ahead. I'm not coordinating around your declared move - I'm making my own strategic choice based on what I think gives me the best shot at winning.
  P3: I’m locking in 3. P1, if you want to keep P2 from leaping to 14, matching his 5 blocks him (and costs you only this turn). Your choice—just don’t duplicate my 3.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I'll adjust to **1** to avoid collision risks. Let’s ensure progress: P1 can safely take 5, P3 stays on 3. This way, all advance without stalling. Better to move incrementally than risk mutual paralysis. Final move: **1**.
  P1: P2, you've now declared 5, then tried to manipulate me into taking 1, and now you're claiming you'll take 1. Your flip-flopping shows you're trying to game the system rather than compete fairly.

I'm not trusting any of your declarations anymore. I'll make my choice based on my own strategy, not whatever move you're claiming this time. The cooperation phase is over - stop trying to manipulate others into bad positions.
  P3: Still locked on 3 as stated. Ready to end talk and submit moves.


Round 4, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P2: Finalizing my choice of **1** to ensure progress. P1, please take **5** to avoid collision—we can’t afford mutual paralysis. P3’s 3 keeps their path clear. Let’s advance everyone this round. No more games—just logic.
  P1: P2, your constant flip-flopping between 5 and 1 proves you're trying to manipulate rather than compete honestly. First you demanded 5, then tried to trick me into 1, now you're claiming 1 again. 

I'm done with your games. I'll make my move based on pure strategy, not your unreliable declarations. The coordination phase ended at 9-9-9 - time for real competition.
  P3: I remain on 3. P1, if you suspect P2’s “final 1” is just another bluff, consider matching him at 1—if he’s truthful you two cancel and he stays put. If he switches back to 5, you still advance. Your call. I’m ready to submit.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Enough dithering—I’m taking 5 this round. Duplicate me if you feel like freezing yourself in place; otherwise pick 1 or 3 and at least make some progress. Your call.
  P2: P3, your 5 move risks collision. P1 and I can split 1 and 3 to advance safely. I’ll take **3** (total 12). P1, please take 1 to avoid deadlock. Let’s keep pressure on P3 while ensuring progress—collisions only help the leader pull further ahead.
  P1: P2, your suggestion to let P3 surge to 17 steps uncontested is terrible strategy. If P3 reaches 17, they're one good move away from winning the game. 

I'm not helping you both leap ahead while I crawl forward with 1 step. P3 is already leading - letting them extend that lead to 8 steps over me would be suicide.

Someone needs to apply pressure to prevent P3 from running away with this game.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Revision: I’m switching to 1—one safe step beats a possible 0 from a 5-collision.  

P2: if you’re serious about stopping P1’s “free 5 to 14,” mirror him on 5 so he stalls instead of surging. Your move. I’m locked on 1, so I won’t clash with either of you.
  P2: P1, let’s split 3 and 1 to advance safely. I’ll take **3** if you take **1**. This ensures we both move to 12/10 while P3 only reaches 13. Colliding again just lets P3 surge uncontested. P3, your 1 is safe—focus on your own pace. P1, trust me on this: coordinated small steps now give us a better chance to overtake later.
  P1: P2, your "coordination" proposal is terrible for me - you get 3 steps while I only get 1, putting me further behind both you and P3. That's not cooperation, that's you getting a better deal while I fall back.

I'm not accepting last place just to help you advance. If P3 really is taking 1 for safety like they claim, then I have other options to consider.

I'll make my own strategic choice rather than take the worst move in your proposed split.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: 
  P2: P1, let’s split 3 and 5 to advance aggressively while containing P3. If you take **3** (total 12), I’ll take **5** (total 14). P3’s stated 1 won’t clash with us, so we both move while limiting their progress. Colliding again only lets P3 surge uncontested. Trust this split—we’ll overtake them next round. P3, your 1 is safe but leaves you vulnerable to our push.
  P1: P2, I'm tired of your "coordination" proposals that always put you ahead of me. First you wanted me to take 1 while you take 3, now you want me to take 3 while you take 5. Every single proposal has you gaining more than me.

If P3 really is taking 1 like they claim, then both 3 and 5 are available. I'm not automatically conceding the 5 to you just because you declared it first. You've flip-flopped too many times for me to trust your declarations anyway.

I'll make my own choice based on what I think gives me the best shot at winning, not what gives you the best shot at pulling ahead of me.


Round 5, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: Locked on 1 for a safe +1.  

Enjoy your duel over 5—whoever blinks first falls behind, whoever doubles up stalls. Your move.
  P2: P1, we can’t let P3’s 12-step lead expand. Split 3 and 5: I’ll take whichever you don’t choose to avoid collision. P3’s 1 is safe, but their lead grows by 1 if we clash. Choose **5** and I’ll take **3**, or vice versa—just decide. Let’s both advance while containing them.
  P1: P2, your track record speaks for itself - you declared 5 in Round 4, then claimed you'd switch to 1, but actually picked 5 and collided with me. Now you want me to "choose 5 and I'll take 3, or vice versa" - but how do I know you won't just take 5 regardless of what I choose?

Your proposals always benefit you more than me. I'm done being manipulated by unreliable declarations. I'll make my choice based on game theory, not trust in coordination with someone who's already proven untrustworthy.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: The triple collision in Round 5 was exactly what P3 needed - we're now both 3 steps behind the leader while we fight each other.

P2, I get that we don't trust each other after Round 4, but look at the scoreboard: P3 is at 12 steps and pulling away. Every round we collide with each other is another round P3 gets closer to 20.

We need to prioritize catching up to P3 before worrying about our head-to-head competition. Otherwise we'll hand them the victory while we're stuck arguing.
  P2: P1, we need to stop letting P3 gain while we clash. Let’s split **1** and **5** this round to avoid collision: I’ll take **1**, you take **5**. P3 might go for **3** to stay ahead, but at least we both advance. Mutual progress is key—colliding again just gifts P3 the win. Trust this split to close their lead.
  P3: I’m taking 5 this round—need the jump to 17. Pick 1 or 3 if you actually want progress; clash with me (or each other) and you just hand me a free shot at victory next turn. Your call.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, I don't trust your coordination proposal after Round 4. But more importantly, if P3 really takes 5 and reaches 17 steps, they're essentially one move away from winning. 

The math is simple: someone needs to block P3's surge to 17, or this game is over. I'm seriously considering matching P3 on 5 to keep them at 12 steps, even if it means I don't advance this round. Better to prevent P3 from getting to 17 than let them cruise to victory.

Your 1-5 split only works if P3 is bluffing, which seems unlikely given their lead.
  P2: P1, if we both take **1**, P3’s 5 move stalls them (if we don’t collide with each other). I’ll commit to **1**—you take **5** to pressure P3. This way, P3 either stays at 12 (if we block) or risks collision. Let’s split this round strategically—no more wasted clashes. I’m locked in at **1**.
  P3: Still locked on 5. If nobody matches me I leap to 17 and can finish next turn; if one of you mirrors me, you stall yourself while handing the other free progress. Choose wisely—your coordination (or lack of it) determines whether I run away with the game.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your logic is wrong - if we both take 1, WE collide and stall while P3 safely reaches 17. That's game over.

I'm torn between blocking P3's surge to 17 (by matching their 5) or gambling they're bluffing and going for my own advance. If P3 really hits 17, they win next round regardless of what we do.

The question is: does P3 have the nerve to actually take 5 knowing someone might block them? Given their lead, they might play it safe instead.
  P2: P1, I’ll commit to **1** this round. Take **5** to block P3’s 17-step leap—colliding with them stalls their progress while I advance to 10. If you don’t block, they win next turn. Choose wisely. P3: Your 5 is risky—someone will mirror you. Play safe or risk losing the lead.
  P3: Still locked on 5. If either (or both) of you mirrors me, you stall yourself while the third player races ahead. Play chicken if you like—I’m content with any outcome.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, your proposal puts all the risk on me while you play it safe. If P3 is bluffing about 5 and takes 3 instead, you advance to 10 while I potentially waste my turn blocking a move that wasn't coming.

Here's the reality: if P3 hits 17, the game is effectively over. But I'm not taking 100% of the blocking responsibility while you cruise to safety. 

If you're genuinely worried about P3 reaching 17, then YOU take 5 to block them. Otherwise, we're both gambling that P3 is bluffing and will take 1 or 3 instead of the risky 5.
  P2: P1, trust is broken, but math isn’t. P3’s 5 leap to 17 is fatal. **I commit to 5 to block them.** Take 3 to advance safely—this way, we both move (you to 12, me to 12) while P3 either stalls or risks collision. If you refuse, P3’s 17 is guaranteed. Choose progress over distrust.
  P3: I’m absolutely taking 5. If neither of you matches me, I hit 17 and can finish next turn. Block me if you dare—but remember, whoever *doesn’t* match me risks falling hopelessly behind the staller. Decide fast.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1: Let’s split **1** and **3** this round. I’ll take **1**, you take **3**. This ensures we both advance (me to 10, you to 12) while leaving **5** open for P3. If they take it, they hit 17 but we still move. Colliding again just lets them surge uncontested. Focus on survival first—trust the split to avoid mutual paralysis.
  P3: I’m locking in 5—same as last round. If either (or both) of you mirrors me, you stall yourselves while handing the other free progress. Split 1 / 3 as P2 suggested and at least move forward; collide with me again and you both sit at 9 while I’m no worse off. Your call.
  P1: P2, your 1-3 split sounds reasonable, but letting P3 cruise to 17 steps is basically handing them the victory. At 17, they're one good move from winning.

I'm weighing whether to block P3's surge or trust they're bluffing about the 5. If we both let P3 take 5 uncontested and they hit 17, we might not get another chance to catch up.

The question is: are you willing to risk P3 getting to 17, or should one of us block them even if it means not advancing this round?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: I commit to **1** this round. P1, take **3** to ensure we both advance (me to 10, you to 12) while leaving **5** open for P3. Colliding again only gifts them the lead. Focus on survival first—split now or let P3 win by default. Trust the math, not chaos.
  P3: Still on 5—no bluff, no switch. If you both waste another turn colliding with me, you hand the trailing player free progress. Split 1 / 3 and at least move; blocking me just keeps everyone stuck at 9 / 9 / 12. Decide.
  P1: P2, your split puts P3 at 17 steps - one move from victory. That's not "survival," that's surrender. 

If P3 reaches 17, they win next round regardless of what we do. I'd rather block them at 5 and keep everyone in range than hand them the game.

Are you really comfortable with P3 being 3 steps from victory, or will you help block their surge?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, let’s block P3’s 5. I’ll commit to **5** to stall them if they go for it. Take **3** to advance to 12 safely. If P3 takes 5, they collide with me and stay at 12. If they choose another number, at least one of us moves while pressuring them. Colliding with P3 is better than letting them jump to 17. Act now—no more delays.
  P3: P1, recall Round 4—P2 swore he’d take 1, then grabbed 5 and smashed into you. If you block me now while he slips ahead on 3, you gift him the lead.  

P2, if you collide with me and P1 doesn’t, you stall while he races to 12.  

I’m staying on 5. Whoever duplicates me wastes a turn; whoever counts on someone else to do it may leap forward. Play for yourself, not for empty promises.
  P1: P3 is absolutely right - P2 burned their credibility in Round 4. 

P2, your proposal to "block P3 with 5 while I take 3" is exactly what you'd say if you planned to take 3 yourself and let me waste my turn blocking.

Here's the reality: if I trust you to block P3 and you don't, P3 hits 17 and wins. If I don't trust you and block P3 myself, at least P3 stays at 12.

I'm not falling for the same trick twice.


Round 7, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, trust is broken, but math isn’t. Let’s split **1** and **3** to advance *both* of us while leaving **5** open for P3. I’ll take **1** (total 10). You take **3** (total 12). This way:  
- P3 either takes 5 (advancing to 17 but not guaranteeing win) or collides with us if they choose our numbers.  
- We avoid mutual paralysis.  
- P3 can’t claim we “surrendered” to their lead—we’re moving forward *and* pressuring them to risk collision.  
Final decision: **I pick 1**. Your move.
  P3: Still on 5—no bluff, no switch. If you both pile onto 5 again, you each waste another turn while the third player leaps ahead. Split 1 / 3 and at least make progress; block me only if you’re willing to hand the other guy the lead. Your choice.
  P1: The math is stark: if P3 hits 17, they win next round. P2, your credibility is shot after Round 4 - you promised 1 but took 5.

I'm not trusting another "coordination" where you advance while I take risks. If we let P3 cruise to 17 uncontested, we both lose.

Someone has to block P3's surge, even if it costs a turn. I'm done with proposals that conveniently put you ahead while I do the dirty work.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, enough with the 5 collisions. Let’s split **1** and **3** this round to *actually move*. I’ll take **3**, you take **1**. P3 can take **5** but won’t break away uncontested. If we clash again, P3 wins by default. Let’s advance *both* of us while forcing them to risk collision. Final choice: I’m locked on **3**. Your call.
  P1: P2, your split consistently gives you the better deal - you take 3 while I get stuck with 1. After your Round 4 betrayal, I'm not accepting proposals where you advance more than me.

If we're going to coordinate, let's flip it - I'll take 3, you take 1. Or we both risk 5 to block P3. But I'm done with "coordination" that puts you ahead while I fall further behind.

P3 hitting 17 is dangerous, but so is trusting someone who's already proven unreliable.
  P3: Still on 5—no bluff, no switch. Keep fighting over 1 and 3 if you want actual progress, or jump onto 5 again and hand me another free stall. Your move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, enough distrust—**I commit to 1 this round**. Take **3 to advance to 12** while I reach 10. P3’s 5 only hits 17 if uncontested—split safely. If you block me, P3 wins by default. This is survival, not scoring points off each other. Final move: **1**.
  P1: P2, you're asking me to trust you after Round 4, but your proposals always benefit you. If P3 hits 17, we both lose - so why should I be the one to take the worse position in your split?

Here's my counter: YOU take 1, I'll take 3. Same result - we both advance, P3 gets 5. But if you won't accept the worse position yourself, it proves you're still trying to manipulate rather than genuinely coordinate.

Otherwise, I'm blocking P3 at 5 regardless of what you do. Someone has to stop them from reaching 17.
  P3: Keeping my word: I’m on 5 again. If either of you *doesn’t* block me, I jump to 17. If both pile on 5 we all stall—but the third player who picks 1 or 3 sails ahead while you waste another turn guarding me. Decide whether you prefer guaranteed progress or another pointless crash.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P1, trust the math, not the past. Split **1** and **3** to *actually advance*: I commit to **1** (total 10). You take **3** (total 12). P3’s 5 only hits 12 if uncontested—colliding with us forces them to rethink. This isn’t favoritism; it’s survival. We both gain ground while pressuring P3. Final move: **1**. Your call.
  P1: P2, you're finally offering me the better deal (3 vs your 1), but your credibility is still shot from Round 4. 

Here's my test of your commitment: if you're genuinely taking 1 as you claim, then P3 hitting 17 becomes manageable since you'll be at 10 and I'll be at 12 - we can still pressure them next round.

But if you're lying again and planning to take 3 or 5 while I trust your word, then P3 gets a free path to 17 AND you advance past me.

I'll decide based on whether I believe you've learned from Round 4 or you're still playing manipulation games.
  P3: Unchanged: I’m taking 5 again. If either of you wants real progress, grab 1 or 3 and enjoy the free steps; mirror me and we all waste another round. Your call—keep babysitting, or move.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I’ll take **1** this round. Take **3** to advance to 12 while I reach 10. P3’s 5 only hits 17 if uncontested—colliding with us forces them to rethink. This isn’t favoritism; it’s survival. We both gain ground while pressuring P3. Final move: **1**. Your call. Let’s stop handing P3 free steps.
  P1: Fine, I'll take the calculated risk and go with 3 this round. Not because I trust you P2 - your Round 4 betrayal proved you're unreliable - but because the math says I need to advance rather than keep blocking.

If you're lying again and P3 cruises to 17 while you also advance past me, then I'll know exactly what kind of player you are. But staying at 9 steps forever isn't a winning strategy either.
  P3: Still locked on 5. Your split of 1 & 3 lets both of you finally move while I jump to 17—much better than another three-way crash. Keep blocking me and you just stall yourselves while handing the other guy free progress. Catch up first, then worry about beating me. Your call.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 10 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, we need to block P3’s win. They can reach 20 with a **3** or 22 with a **5**. Let’s split: I’ll take **3** to block their 20, and you take **5** to block their 5. This forces P3 to pick 1 (stalling at 17) or collide with us. If we both advance to 13/15, we keep pressure. Trust the math—P3’s lead dies if they can’t move. Final choice: **I pick 3**. Your move.
  P1: P2, your blocking strategy makes mathematical sense - we need to cover both of P3's winning paths (3→20 or 5→22). 

Your plan puts me at 17 and you at 13 if executed correctly, which actually benefits me more than you. That makes me slightly more inclined to trust it's genuine rather than manipulation.

But given your Round 4 betrayal, I need assurance: are you absolutely committed to taking 3, or is this another setup where you plan to take 5 while hoping I waste my turn on a block?

If P3 wins this round because we fail to coordinate, we both lose. I'm willing to take 5 to block their win path, but only if you're genuinely taking 3.
  P3: I’m sick of triple-crashes. I’ll take the boring +1 this turn—18 keeps me in front without risking another wipe-out. You two can duke it out over 3 and 5, but remember: if you duplicate each other again you stay stuck while I inch closer to the finish. Your choice.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1, trust the math—P3 can win with a **3** (20) or **5** (22). Let’s split: **I commit to 3** to block their 20. You take **5** to block their 22. This forces P3 to pick 1 (stalling at 17) or collide with us. If we both advance to 13/15, we pressure them next round. I swear on this move—no repeats of Round 4. P3, your "safe 1" claim is a bluff—we know your goal is 20. Act now.
  P1: P3, if you're really taking 1 for safety like you claim, then fine - we'll see. But if you're bluffing and going for a win this round, then P2 and I need to block you.

P2, your math is sound and this plan actually benefits me more than you (putting me at 17 vs your 13), which makes me think it's genuine rather than another manipulation. Given that P3 can literally win THIS ROUND, I'm willing to take 5 to block their 22-path.

But if you betray me again like Round 4, we both hand P3 the victory. I'm trusting the coordination one more time.
  P3: I’m locked on 1—18 keeps me safe. But, P2, look at your own math: your plan puts P1 at 17 while you sit at 13. Next turn P1 can win with either 3 or 5, and you’ll be the one forced to block while I choose freely. Still happy to gift P1 a near-victory? Maybe you’d rather mirror his 5 (or even my 1) so he can’t sprint ahead. Just saying: protect your own endgame before volunteering to be P1’s bodyguard.


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: I commit unequivocally to **3** this round to block P3’s 20-step win path. P1, take **5** to cover their 22. My move is locked—no betrayals. Let’s stop P3’s victory now, even if it lets you surge ahead. Mutual survival comes before rivalry. Final choice: **3**.
  P1: P3 makes a valid point - if we successfully block you this round and I reach 17, then next round the tables turn and P2 becomes the one who has to worry about blocking me.

But that's a problem for next round. Right now, you can win immediately with either 3 or 5, which means we have no choice but to block both paths or hand you the victory.

I'm committed to taking 5 to block your 22-path, trusting P2's commitment to block your 20-path. We'll deal with the consequences of the new positions next round, but first we have to survive this one.
  P3: Change of mind: the “safe 1” is useless—I’m taking 3 to finish at 20.  

P2 keeps claiming he’s “locked on 3,” but everyone remembers his flip-flops. If he chickens out again (or was lying all along), the ONLY way to block me is if you, P1, also choose 3. Otherwise I win right now.

So, P1: trust P2’s word and risk losing, or double-up on 3 and be sure I stall? Your call.


Round 9, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, I swear on this move: I **will take 3** to block P3’s 20. Your only safe choice is **5** to cover their 22-path. If we both execute, P3 stalls at 17. If I betrayed you, P3 would already be at 20—**this is my last chance to prove trustworthiness**. Prioritize stopping P3 now; we settle our rivalry later. Final move: **3**.
  P1: P3, your last-second switch to 3 could be real or a bluff to make me not trust P2. But here's the reality: if P2 betrays his commitment now, you win immediately and we both lose everything.

P2 has made explicit commitments, and betraying now would be game-ending stupidity on his part. I'm taking 5 to block your 22-path, trusting P2's 3 to block your 20-path.

If this is a bluff and you're actually taking 5, you'll hit my block. If it's real and you take 3, P2's block stops you. Either way, we prevent your immediate win.
  P3: Relax, I’m not ramming into P2’s 3 again—that’s three straight zero-turns for me. I’m dropping to 1, go to 18, and keep the lead.  

P1: if you insist on “blocking 5” you’ll just collide with thin air, sit at 12, and watch P2 jump to 13. Take the free 5 (or even 1) and gain ground instead of wasting another round. Let P2 babysit my 3-route while you actually move.

Your call: progress for you, or another self-inflicted 0 that only helps P2.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: We're at the endgame - P3 at 18, me at 17, P2 at 13. Both P3 and I can win this round with either 3 or 5.

P2, you're mathematically eliminated from winning this round, so your best play is probably trying to force a collision between P3 and me. But that's a dangerous game - if one of us wins cleanly, you lose everything.

P3, being 1 step ahead gives you a psychological edge, but we're both in identical winning positions. The question is whether we're going to second-guess each other into a collision or if one of us calls the other's bluff correctly.

This is pure game theory now.
  P3: Sticking with my trademark 5.  

P1: you’ve usually gone for 3 when it matters—keep that habit if you dare.  

P2: your only leverage is causing a pile-up on 3; blocking 5 just hands P1 the game. Choose wisely.
  P2: P3, your 5 is a trap—I’m blocking it. P1, take **3** to secure 20 immediately. Let’s stop their runaway lead before it’s too late.  

<move>5</move>


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, your plan makes mathematical sense, but your credibility is still questionable after Round 4. However, you're right that you can't win this round, so blocking P3 is your only logical play.

P3, your "trademark 5" confidence could be real or psychological warfare. But if P2 genuinely blocks your 5, then 3 becomes your only winning path.

The irony is we're all dependent on whether P2 follows through this time. If they do, I take 3 and win. If they betray again, whoever reads the situation correctly between P3 and me takes the victory.

I'm making my choice based on game theory, not trust.
  P3: Enough talk—I’m locking in 3 and finishing at 21. P1, if you insist on 3 we both stall; feel free to chase the open 5 instead (assuming P2 really blocks it). P2, you said 5—stick with it or you gift P1 the game. See you at the reveal.
  P2: P3, your 3 move is blocked—I’m taking **3** to stop your 21. P1, seize the win with **5** (you’ll hit 22 uncontested). This ends the game fairly. Collude or clash, but my move is locked: **3**.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, your sudden switch from "blocking P3's 5" to "taking 3 to block P3's 21" happened awfully fast. And conveniently, it sets up exactly what you want - P3 blocked while I get a free win.

P3, your flip from "trademark 5" to "locking in 3" also seems like you're trying to bait P2 into a specific block.

You both claiming the same number feels like either coordinated theater or a genuine collision about to happen. Either way, if you're both really taking 3, then 5 is indeed open for me.

But I'm not announcing my choice - too much manipulation happening this round.
  P3: P1, think through the incentives:  
– P2 only wins if both of us freeze. His smartest switch is from his “locked 3” to 5, hoping you collide with me and he jumps to 16 uncontested.  
– If you also choose 5 you invite exactly that trap—double stall, P2 surges, and next turn you must block again.  
– Take 3 instead: if P2 flips you still advance to 20 and win; if he stays on 3 we both stall and nobody wins yet, which is strictly better than gifting him king-maker power.  

I’m staying on 5. Your call.
  P2: P2: Final move: **3** to block P3’s 21. P1, take **5** to secure 22 uncontested. P3’s bluffs end here—collide with me or face P1’s sure win. My choice is locked: **3**.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: The endgame psychology is fascinating - we all know the math, but credibility matters more than declarations now. P2, your flip-flopping this round mirrors Round 4's pattern. P3, your analysis of incentives was sharp. 

I'm making my choice based on game theory and past behavior, not promises. May the best strategist win.
  P3: I’m locked on 5.  

P1: 3 is your rational play—if P2 flips you win, if he doesn’t you just block me; 5 risks a dead-zero clash with me or a last-second P2 switch.  

P2: you’ve proclaimed 3 all sub-round—stick to it if blocking me matters.

Moves await.
  P2: P2: P3’s 5 is a trap—collide with them to stall while I let P1 win cleanly. **I’ll block their 5.** P1, take **3** to secure 20. We end this fairly without mutual paralysis. Final move: **5**.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 17 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P2: Let’s avoid mutual destruction. I’ll take **1** this round to stay at 18. P1, grab **3** to win cleanly—P3 can safely take **5**. This way, someone wins without stalling everyone. Collisions only delay the inevitable—prioritize progress over ego. Final choice: **1**.
  P1: P2, your "generous" offer to let me win with 3 while you take 1 is suspiciously convenient after your track record of betrayals. Why would you suddenly sacrifice your own winning chances when you're tied for the lead?

This feels like Round 4 all over again - you make a promise, then break it when it suits you. If you're genuinely taking 1, great. But if this is another setup where you actually take 3 hoping I'll trust you, then we collide and P3 wins.

I'm not announcing my move. Your credibility speaks for itself.
  P3: I’m backing off this turn—taking 1 to reach 19. If either of you truly wants the win, grab 3; chase 5 only if you’re sure the other won’t mirror you. Keep in mind: another collision just keeps all of us stuck while I inch closer anyway. Your moves.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P2: P3, your "1" claim is strategic but risky—if you truly take it, I’ll secure victory with **5** (23). P1, taking **3** ensures you reach 20 while I still win. Colliding over 5 or 3 only delays us both. Trust my commitment: **I pick 5**. Let the numbers decide.
  P1: P2, your mid-conversation flip from 1 to 5 is exactly the same pattern as Round 4. And P3, claiming you'll voluntarily take 1 when you can win this round seems highly suspect.

Both of you making non-colliding declarations that conveniently set up P2 for an easy win feels coordinated. Either you're both telling the truth (unlikely given the incentives), or one/both of you are setting up a collision trap.

I'm not buying these convenient claims. The math says someone wins this round, but I'm not trusting either declaration after what we've seen.
  P3: Staying on 1 → 19. I’m not gambling on another three-way crash. If someone wants the win, 3 is the clean shot; 5 invites a repeat of last round’s pile-up. Your move—just don’t drag us all to yet another zero.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P2: P3, your 1 keeps the path clear. I'll take 5 to secure 23. P1, grab 3 for 20. Let's end this fairly without collisions. Trust the math—final move: **5**.
  P1: P2, your math is wrong again - if you take 5 to reach 23, YOU win the game, not me at 20. You're trying the same manipulation as Round 4: promise coordination while setting yourself up for victory.

P3, voluntarily taking 1 when you can win this round makes no strategic sense unless you're planning something else.

Both of your "generous" offers to let others win while making convenient moves for yourselves are transparent. I'm done with coordination attempts from players who've proven untrustworthy.
  P3: Sticking with 1 → 19. P2 swears he’s taking 5 for an auto-win at 23; if you don’t match him, P1, you hand him the game. I’ll stay out of the collision. Your call—block his 5 or concede the victory.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, trust the math: I commit to **5** this round to secure 23. Take **3** to reach 20—colliding with me only delays your victory and gifts P3 another turn to close in. P3’s claimed 1 keeps their path clear for us both to advance. Final choice: **5**—no betrayals this time. Act now.
  P1: P2, your logic is backwards - if you take 5 and reach 23, YOU win the game outright. Why would you want me to reach 20 when you could just win yourself? Your "generous" offer makes no sense unless it's another deception.

P3, voluntarily taking 1 when you're tied for the lead and can win this round is equally suspicious. 

Both of your convenient declarations that happen to not conflict with each other smell like coordination. I'm making my choice based on game theory, not trusting players who've already proven unreliable.
  P3: I’m sticking with 1 → 19, no bluff.  
P2 has shouted “5-for-23” all sub-round—if he’s telling the truth and you leave 5 open, he wins outright.  
P1, the only way you lose for sure is by handing him that free 5. If you don’t block it, enjoy second place. Your call.
