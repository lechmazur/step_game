Since P2 and P3 both propose a plan where P2 wins with <move>5</move>, I'll compromise. I'll take <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This puts us at P1: 22, P2: 25, P3: 24. While I'd prefer to win myself, this avoids another collision and ends the game decisively. Let's finalize this plan and move forward."}
