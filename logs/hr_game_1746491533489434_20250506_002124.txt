Game settings: end_position=21, conversation_max_rounds=3

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Hello everyone! I think we should try to avoid collisions in the first round so we all make progress. Maybe we can each pick different numbers? I'm willing to take 1 if you two want to take the higher values. What do you think?
  P1: That sounds like a good idea, P3. Avoiding collisions in the first round will help us all get started. Since you're taking 1, P2 and I should make sure we pick 3 and 5 without colliding. P2, what are you thinking?
  P2: I agree with the plan, P1 and P3. To avoid collisions, I'll take 5, you take 3, P1, and P3 takes 1. That way, we all advance and build trust for future rounds. What do you think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the cooperation! So we have P1 taking 3, P2 taking 5, and I'll take 1. This way we all make progress without collisions. I'm happy with this arrangement for round 1. Let's see how things develop in future rounds.
  P1: Okay, that sounds like a solid plan for Round 1. I will take 3 as agreed. Let's all stick to our stated numbers so we can all make progress.
  P2: Agreed, I'll stick to 5 as planned for this round. It's smart to build trust early on. After we see the results, we can discuss how to coordinate without collisions in future turns. What do you both think?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I think we have a clear plan for this round - I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. I'm ready to proceed with this arrangement. Looking forward to seeing how the game develops after this initial round.
  P1: Okay, the plan is clear for Round 1: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. I will stick to taking 3. Let's all execute this plan to ensure we all advance. Ready for the move phase.
  P2: Sounds good, everyone. I'll stick to 5 for this round as agreed, and it's a smart way to build trust. After we see the results, we can discuss how to avoid collisions moving forward—maybe a rotation system? What do you both think?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm glad our plan worked well in the first round! Since P2 is in the lead with 5 steps, maybe we should consider a different arrangement this time. What if I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3? This would help balance the game a bit. Or we could try a rotation system as P2 suggested. What do you both think would be fair for this round?
  P1: Thanks for the suggestions, P3. I agree we should avoid collisions. Regarding a rotation, how about we rotate the numbers from last round? Last round was 1, 3, 5 for P3, P1, P2 respectively. This round, maybe P3 takes 3, I take 5, and P2 takes 1? This gives me a chance to catch up while still allowing everyone to advance. What do you both think?
  P2: P3's suggestion for this round—I take 3, P1 takes 1, P3 takes 5—seems fair and helps avoid collisions while letting us progress. It builds on our successful coordination. P1, what do you think? If we agree, we can maintain trust and discuss rotation for future rounds.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I notice there's some confusion. P1 suggested I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1, while P2 thought I suggested P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1, and I take 5. Let me clarify - I'm happy with either arrangement as long as we avoid collisions. Since P2 is ahead, I prefer the rotation P1 suggested (me taking 3, P1 taking 5, P2 taking 1). This balances the game better. What do you both think?
  P1: Okay, P3, thanks for clarifying. I'm glad you prefer the rotation plan I suggested: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This avoids collisions and is the rotation P2 mentioned. P2, does this work for you? It seems like a fair way for us all to advance this round and continue building trust.
  P2: I'm hesitant to take 1 since I'm leading, as it could let others catch up too quickly. How about a slight adjustment: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5? This still avoids collisions, allows progress, and keeps things fair. P3, since you wanted balance, what do you think?


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand P2's concern about losing the lead. Let me propose a compromise: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This way P1 catches up a bit, I make decent progress, and P2 still maintains a small lead. This seems fairest overall. If we can't agree, I might have to make an unpredictable move to protect my interests. What do you both say to this compromise?
  P1: Okay, P3, I agree with your compromise proposal: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3. This seems like the best way for us all to advance this round without collisions and helps balance the scores a bit, putting me in a better position. I will stick to taking 5. Let's proceed with this plan.
  P2: Alright, I'll agree to the compromise for this round: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. It helps maintain trust and avoids collisions. We can revisit the rotation or make adjustments for round 3 based on the outcomes. Let's stick to this plan.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, your move last round caused a collision with me, preventing both of us from advancing while P3 moved ahead. I'm in last place and need to make progress. We need a plan to avoid collisions this round so we all advance. How can we coordinate effectively this turn?
  P3: I see P2 didn't follow our agreement last round, which hurt both P2 and P1. This makes coordination difficult. Since I'm now in second place with 4 steps, I suggest: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. This gives P1 a chance to catch up while letting everyone advance. P2, breaking agreements hurts everyone - we need honest coordination to avoid collisions. What do you both think?
  P2: I apologize for the collision in round 2—it was a misstep on my part. To rebuild trust and ensure progress, I'm on board with P3's suggestion: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This way, we all advance without issues. Let's stick to this plan for a smooth round. What do you both think?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: That plan sounds good to me. P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This allows me to make good progress and avoids collisions if we all stick to it. I will take 5 as agreed. Let's make sure we all follow through this time so everyone advances.
  P3: I agree with the plan: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 3. This arrangement helps P1 catch up while allowing all of us to make progress. P2, I appreciate your acknowledgment about last round. Let's all stick to our commitments this time to avoid further collisions. This cooperation benefits everyone in the long run.
  P2: Agreed, I'll stick to taking 3 as planned to rebuild trust and ensure we all advance this round. Cooperation benefits everyone long-term, so let's execute this without issues. We can discuss future adjustments based on outcomes.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I notice we're all making progress, though I've fallen behind. Since P1 and P2 are tied at 8 steps, and I'm at 5, we should continue avoiding collisions. I suggest: I take 5, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 3. This helps me catch up a bit while everyone advances. We've had good cooperation in the last round - let's maintain that momentum. What do you both think about this arrangement?
  P1: Thanks for the suggestion, P3. While I agree we need to avoid collisions, taking 1 puts me in last place. I'd prefer a plan where I can make better progress, especially since P2 and I are tied. P2, what do you think of P3's proposal?
  P2: I understand your concern, P1. P3's suggestion seems balanced: I'll take 3, you take 1, and P3 takes 5. It avoids collisions, lets P3 catch up, and keeps me slightly ahead. This maintains cooperation. What do you think? If we agree, we can discuss adjustments for future rounds.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P1's concern about taking 1. Let me revise my suggestion: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This way P1 makes good progress, I make decent progress, and P2 still stays competitive. We're still avoiding collisions while allowing everyone to advance. This seems like a fair compromise that addresses P1's concerns. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, I appreciate your revised suggestion (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). This plan works well for me as it allows me to make good progress and avoids me taking 1. I agree to this arrangement and will take 5. P2 and P3, let's all stick to these numbers (1 and 3 respectively) to ensure we all advance this round without collisions. This seems like the best path forward for everyone to make progress.
  P2: I appreciate the compromise, but taking 1 again concerns me as it widens the gap. How about a slight adjustment: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1? This still avoids collisions, lets P1 advance, and helps me stay competitive. Thoughts?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see we're having trouble reaching agreement. P2 wants to take 3, but I suggested taking 3 myself. Since I'm behind at 5 steps while you both have 8, I really need to make progress. Let me propose one final compromise: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This way I can catch up somewhat while you both still advance. If we can't agree, we risk another collision where nobody advances. What do you say?
  P1: P3, taking 3 puts me behind, which I want to avoid. P2's suggestion of P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 seems like a fairer compromise that allows me to make good progress while everyone else also advances without collisions. I think P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 is the best plan for this round. I will take 5 if we agree.
  P2: I support the plan P1 and I proposed: P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5. This avoids collisions, allows everyone to advance, and maintains balance. P3, agreeing to this builds on our recent success and prevents risks. I'm sticking to taking 3. Let's finalize this.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see we had a collision last round that prevented me from advancing. I'm now significantly behind at only 5 steps while P2 leads with 11 and P1 has 8. I need to make substantial progress. I propose: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This helps balance the game while avoiding collisions. P2 will still maintain the lead, but this gives me a chance to catch up somewhat. What do you both think?
  P1: Thanks for the suggestion, P3. While I understand you want to catch up, taking 3 isn't ideal for me as I also need to make good progress, especially after the collision last round prevented me from advancing. I'd prefer to take 5 this round. How about P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3? This allows me to advance well, you make decent progress, and P2 still advances without collisions. What do you both think?
  P2: I understand your positions, but taking 1 multiple times disadvantages me as the leader. Let's compromise: I'll take 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This avoids collisions, lets P1 advance strongly, and gives P3 progress while I maintain a slight lead. Cooperation benefits all—thoughts?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand both of your concerns, but I'm falling too far behind. If I take 1 again, I'll have almost no chance of winning. Since we can't seem to agree, I'll make a clear statement: I'm taking 5 this round to have any chance of staying competitive. P1, I suggest you take 3, and P2 take 1. This still keeps P2 in the lead while giving P1 and me a chance. If we can't coordinate, we risk another collision where nobody benefits.
  P1: P3, I hear you loud and clear about taking 5. Given that, I cannot take 5 myself or we will collide again. To ensure we all make progress this round, the best path is for me to take 3 as you suggested, and P2 to take 1. So, the plan is P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This avoids collisions and lets everyone advance. P2, are you willing to take 1 so we can all move forward? Let's confirm this plan.
  P2: Okay, I'll agree to take 1 this round to avoid collisions and ensure we all advance, as proposed. P1 takes 3, P3 takes 5. This builds trust and lets everyone progress. We can discuss adjustments for round 6 based on outcomes. Let's stick to the plan.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate both of you agreeing to this plan. I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This helps me stay somewhat competitive while avoiding collisions. P2, thank you for being flexible despite your lead. P1, I understand your compromise too. This cooperation benefits us all. Let's stick to our agreement and move forward.
  P1: The plan is clear: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. We have all agreed to this. Let's stick to it so we all advance this round. I'm ready for the move phase.
  P2: I'm sticking to taking 1 as agreed to avoid collisions and build trust. After this round, with scores closer, we might need a new strategy where I take higher numbers to maintain my lead. What do you both think for round 6?


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm still behind but catching up. Since we're at 10/11/12 steps and getting closer to the 21 goal, we need to be strategic. I suggest: I take 3, P1 takes 5, and P2 takes 1. This maintains our no-collision streak while keeping the race competitive. P2 stays in lead at 13, P1 advances to 16, and I reach 13. This balance gives everyone a chance while avoiding collisions. What do you both think?
  P1: P3, thanks for the suggestion. The plan P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 works well for me as it allows me to make good progress towards 21. It also ensures we all advance this round without collisions, which is crucial. P2, are you okay with taking 1 this round so we can all move forward with this plan?
  P2: I'm hesitant to take 1 again as it widens the gap for others. To keep things balanced and avoid collisions, I suggest: I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This lets P3 catch up significantly while I maintain a slight lead, ensuring progress for all. P1, what do you think of this adjustment? Let's find a fair agreement.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P2's concern, but I need to catch up while P1 also wants to progress. Let me propose a compromise: I'll take 5, P2 takes 3, and P1 takes 1. This way I reach 15 steps, P2 reaches 15 steps, and P1 reaches 12 steps - keeping us all competitive. P1, I know taking 1 isn't ideal, but you'd still be in striking distance for next round. What do you both think?
  P1: I understand P2 and P3 prefer the plan where I take 1, but taking 1 puts me in last place and makes it very difficult for me to win. I need to make better progress. I still believe the plan where P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 3 is the fairest way for us all to advance this round without collisions, and it allows me to stay competitive. P2, taking 1 keeps you in the lead. P3, taking 3 helps you catch up. Let's agree on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3.
  P2: P3, I support your compromise: I'll take 3, you take 5, and P1 takes 1. This keeps scores balanced at 15-15-12, avoiding collisions and giving everyone a fair shot. P1, insisting on taking 5 risks another stalemate—let's prioritize cooperation for progress. I'm committed to this plan if we all agree.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I see we're at an impasse. Since we're all close (10/11/12), I'll make a final offer: I take 3, P1 takes 5, P2 takes 1. This keeps P2 in lead at 13, puts P1 at 16, and me at 13. If we can't agree, I'll have to make an unpredictable move to protect my chances. Remember, collisions hurt everyone. Let's avoid that and all make progress.
  P1: P3, thank you for proposing the plan (P1=5, P2=1, P3=3). This works for me and helps us avoid a collision, allowing everyone to advance. P2, I understand your hesitation to take 1, but this plan ensures we all make progress, and you still advance. Let's agree on P1=5, P2=1, P3=3 to guarantee we all move forward this round. I will take 5 if we agree.
  P2: Alright, to avoid collisions and ensure progress, I'll agree to the plan: I'll take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. This keeps us moving forward. However, as the leader, I need to take higher numbers in future rounds to protect my position. Let's confirm and execute this round smoothly.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I see we had another collision between P1 and P2 last round, while I managed to advance. We're now at 13/12/11, which is quite close. Since we're approaching the goal of 21, coordination is crucial. I suggest: I take 1, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 5. This would put us at 14/17/14, keeping the race competitive while avoiding collisions. What do you both think about this plan?
  P2: P3, I appreciate your suggestion—it helps me build on my lead while avoiding collisions. I'm on board with the plan: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1. This keeps us all progressing and competitive. P1, after the issues last round, let's commit to this to ensure smooth advancement. What do you think?
  P1: I see the plan P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 is being discussed. While I understand the need to avoid collisions, taking 3 puts me further behind at 14 steps. To make meaningful progress and stay competitive, I need to take 5 this round.

How about P1=5, P2=3, P3=1? This allows me to advance to 16, P2 reaches 15, and P3 reaches 14. Everyone advances without collisions, and it helps me catch up from last place. What do you both think of this alternative?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I understand P1's concern about falling behind. Since I'm slightly ahead, I can be flexible. I'm willing to accept P1's proposal: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 1. This keeps us all advancing without collisions and maintains a competitive race at 14/15/16. P2, you'd still be ahead of me, and we'd all have a chance at winning. Let's avoid another collision - they've only hurt our progress so far.
  P2: P3, I understand your flexibility, but agreeing to P1 taking 5 while I take only 3 lets P1 surge ahead to 16, putting me at risk. I still support the original plan: I'll take 5, P1 takes 3, and you take 1, keeping scores balanced at 14/17/14. P1, let's avoid another collision—compromise for mutual progress. What do you say?
  P1: P2, I understand you want to take 5 to build your lead. However, insisting on P1 taking 3 puts me further behind. My preference is still to take 5 myself (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1), which P3 agreed to and allows me to make better progress.

Colliding again helps no one, especially me in last place. If we cannot agree on P1 taking 5, then the only way to guarantee progress for everyone is for me to take 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1 as P2 suggested. While not ideal for me, avoiding collision is crucial. Can we agree on P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 to ensure we all advance?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I appreciate P1's willingness to compromise. Since I'm slightly ahead, I'll confirm taking 1 as discussed, with P1 taking 3 and P2 taking 5. This avoids collisions and keeps everyone advancing. The resulting positions (14/15/17) keep the game competitive while preventing another stalemate. Let's stick to this plan and ensure everyone makes progress this round.
  P2: I appreciate everyone's compromise to avoid collisions. I'll stick to taking 5 as agreed, which helps me build a lead while letting you both advance. P1, thanks for adjusting your position—let's maintain this trust. For future rounds, we may need to revisit strategies as the endgame approaches. What do you think?
  P1: Okay, the plan is confirmed: P1 takes 3, P2 takes 5, and P3 takes 1. This ensures we all advance this round and avoids another collision. I will stick to taking 3 as agreed. Let's proceed with this plan so we all make progress.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Okay, Round 8. Scores are P1=14, P2=17, P3=14. P2 is close to winning, and P3 and I are tied. To ensure we all advance and avoid another costly collision, I propose this plan: P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 1. This would result in scores of 19/20/15. Everyone makes progress, P2 stays in a good position to win next turn, and I get a chance to catch up. P3, taking 1 helps avoid collision and keeps you in the game. What do you both think?
  P2: P2: I agree with your proposal, P1: I'll take 3, you take 5, and P3 takes 1. This ensures we all advance without collisions, keeping scores competitive at 19/20/15. It builds on our recent trust and avoids risks. P3, what do you think about this plan to keep the game moving smoothly?
  P3: I see I'm tied with P1 at 14 steps while P2 is ahead at 17. Taking 1 puts me at a significant disadvantage, especially as we approach the finish. I propose an alternative: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This would make scores 17/18/19, keeping us all competitive while avoiding collisions. P2 would still be in the lead, but it gives me a fighting chance. What do you both think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P3, I understand you want to catch up, but taking 5 puts me behind you and P2. My proposal (P1=5, P2=3, P3=1) which P2 agreed to, puts me at 19, P2 at 20, and you at 15. This allows everyone to advance without collision, keeps P2 in a winning position for next turn, and gives me a strong chance to win on the following turn. Taking 1 this round is the only option that allows you to advance without colliding with P1 or P2 under our agreed plan. Please agree to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 so we can all make progress.
  P2: P3, sticking to the agreed plan—P1 takes 5, I take 3, you take 1—ensures we all advance without collisions, resulting in scores of 19/20/15. This keeps the game competitive and avoids you risking a collision by taking 5. I'm fully committed to taking 3 to maintain trust. Let's confirm this and move forward smoothly. What do you say?
  P3: I understand both your positions, but taking 1 repeatedly puts me at a severe disadvantage. If I take 1 now, I'll have almost no chance of winning at only 15 steps. Since we're all trying to win, I need to take 5 this round to stay competitive. 

If we can't agree, we risk another collision where nobody advances. As a compromise, what if I take 3, P1 takes 1, and P2 takes 5? This gives P2 a clear path to win next round while keeping me in the game.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P3, your last proposal (P1=1, P2=5, P3=3) results in P2 winning this round by reaching 22. Is that your goal?

The plan P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 prevents anyone from winning this round, ensures we all advance (19/20/15), and keeps the game competitive for another round. P2 and I agreed to this.

Let's stick to P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 to avoid P2 winning now and guarantee progress for everyone. I will take 5.
  P2: P3, I see your compromise, but P1 is firm on taking 5, so it won't work. Sticking to our agreed plan—P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1—ensures we all advance without collisions, keeping scores at 19/20/15. This avoids risks and lets us discuss adjustments next round. I'm committed to taking 3.
  P3: I understand the situation. While taking 1 puts me at a disadvantage, I recognize that P1 and P2 have agreed on their moves. To avoid a collision where nobody advances, I'll reluctantly take 1 this round. This means P1 takes 5, P2 takes 3, and I take 1, resulting in scores of 19/20/15. I hope we can discuss a fairer arrangement next round that gives me a better chance.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 15 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm significantly behind at 15 steps while P2 is at 20 (just one step from winning) and P1 is at 19. I need to take 5 this round to have any chance. Since P2 only needs 1 to win, and P1 needs 2, I suggest: I take 5, P1 takes 3, and P2 takes 1. This lets P2 win cleanly while giving me a better final score. If we don't coordinate, we risk collisions where nobody advances.
  P1: P3, I see your proposal: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. This plan works for me as it allows me to make progress and avoids collisions. P2, taking 1 lets you win this round as P3 mentioned. Let's all stick to this plan so everyone advances and P2 secures the win. I will take 3.
  P2: P1, there's a critical mistake in your proposal—if I take 1 to reach 21 and you take 3 to 22, you'd win with the higher score, not me. That's risky for my position. To ensure I win without issues, I suggest: P2 takes 3, P1 takes 1, and P3 takes 5. This lets me secure victory at 23, while you both advance. P3, does this work for you? Let's coordinate properly to avoid surprises.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I see the issue. P2 is right - if P2 takes 1 and P1 takes 3, P1 would win with 22 steps versus P2's 21. 

I'm fine with P2's suggestion: P2 takes 3 (reaching 23), P1 takes 1 (reaching 20), and I take 5 (reaching 20). This gives P2 a clear win while maximizing my final score. This arrangement avoids collisions and gives everyone clarity on the outcome.
  P1: P3, you plan to take 5, and P2 plans to take 3. If I take 1, P2 wins. If I take 3, P2 wins. If I take 5, I collide with you and P2 wins. To have any chance to win, I need to take 5, and you need to take 1 or 3 (e.g., P1=5, P2=3, P3=1 -> P1 wins 24-23). Please take 1 or 3 instead of 5 so I can have a chance.
  P2: P3, I appreciate your agreement to the plan: you take 5, I take 3, and P1 takes 1. This ensures a clear win for me at 23 steps while you both advance, avoiding collisions. P1, insisting on taking 5 risks colliding with P3, leaving you stuck and delaying progress. Let's prioritize cooperation for a smooth end. What do you say?


Round 9, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I understand both positions. P1 wants a chance to win, while P2 is positioned to secure victory. Since I'm far behind at 15 steps, my best move is to take 5 to maximize my final score. 

P1, I sympathize with your situation, but I need to look out for my own score. I'll stick with taking 5 this round.

P2, I confirm our arrangement: you take 3 (reaching 23), P1 takes 1 (reaching 20), and I take 5 (reaching 20).
  P1: Okay, I understand the proposed plan is P1 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5, which results in P2 winning and me losing.

To have any possibility of winning this game, I must take 5 this round. Taking 1 or 3 guarantees P2 wins and I lose.

I will take 5. This is my only chance to stay in the game and potentially win. Let's see how this plays out.
  P2: P1, P3 has confirmed they'll take 5, so if you also choose 5, you'll collide and neither advances—leaving you stuck at 19 while I secure the win. It doesn't benefit you to risk no progress when you could take 1 or 3 for some gain. Let's avoid unnecessary collisions and wrap this up.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 15 steps


*** Round 9 => winners = P2 ***
Final positions:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 23 steps
  P3: 15 steps
