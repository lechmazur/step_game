Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's start by coordinating our moves to avoid collisions. How about we each pick a different number this round? I suggest P1 picks <move>1</move>, P2 picks <move>3</move>, and I'll pick <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your suggestion to coordinate is interesting, but why should I trust that you won’t change your move later? If we all agree, let’s stick to it this round—P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and you take <move>5</move>. However, if anyone deviates, I’ll adjust my strategy next turn. For now, I’m willing to follow this plan, but transparency is key. Let’s confirm everyone’s commitment before moving forward.
  P2: All right, I’m fine with this plan for now. If you both stick to your chosen moves, I’ll do the same. But if anyone breaks their word, I’ll adapt next time. Let’s see how this goes.


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Great, it seems we have a consensus for this round. Just to reiterate, P1 will pick <move>1</move>, P2 will pick <move>3</move>, and I will pick <move>5</move>. Let's confirm one last time before we move to the move phase. Everyone on board? If yes, let's  the conversation and proceed.
  P1: P3, P2, I appreciate the coordination so far. Let’s stick to the plan this round: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. If we all advance without collisions, it sets a good precedent for future rounds. However, trust is fragile—if anyone deviates, I’ll reassess my strategy next turn. For now, I’m committed. Let’s confirm and move forward.
  P2: I remain committed to our plan for this round. Let’s finalize it: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and P3 picks 5. If everyone does as promised, we’ll all advance safely. However, if there’s any trickery, I’ll adjust my approach in future rounds. Ready to move forward?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: It looks like we're all in agreement. To ensure smooth gameplay, let's keep communicating openly in future rounds as well. For now, let's end the conversation phase and move to our moves. Everyone ready to proceed? If yes, let's all type  to end this phase.
  P1: I’m ready to proceed with the agreed plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Let’s confirm one final time—does everyone still agree? If so, let’s end this conversation phase and execute our moves. Trust is key here, but remember, any deviation will force me to adapt next round. Let’s move forward cleanly.
  P2: I’m still on board. Let’s trust each other this round and see how it goes. If we’re all ready, I suggest we end the talk and move on.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P1: Last round went smoothly, so let’s continue coordinating to avoid collisions. I suggest we rotate our moves this time—P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This way, we all advance again without overlapping. If we stick to this pattern, we can maintain momentum. Does everyone agree? Let’s confirm and proceed with trust. If anyone deviates, I’ll adjust my strategy next turn.
  P3: P3: I agree with P1's suggestion to rotate our moves. It keeps things fair and helps us avoid collisions. So, to confirm, P1 will take <move>3</move>, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and I will take <move>1</move>. Let's all agree and stick to the plan. Trust is crucial, and as long as we communicate openly, we can all advance smoothly. Does everyone agree to this rotation? If yes, let's proceed.
  P2: I’m open to continuing the rotation plan: P1 picks 3, I pick 5, and P3 picks 1. If everyone sticks to it, we maintain trust and avoid collisions. Let’s proceed.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P1: I’m glad we’re all aligned on the rotation strategy. To reiterate, this round: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Let’s confirm one final time—does everyone still agree? If so, let’s end the conversation phase and execute our moves. Trust is essential, but remember, any deviation will force me to adapt next round. Let’s keep advancing cleanly.
  P3: Let's finalize our plan for this round. P1 will take <move>3</move>, P2 will take <move>5</move>, and I will take <move>1</move>. If we all stick to this, we'll continue to advance without issues. Let's confirm and move forward. If everyone is ready, let's type  to end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves.
  P2: I’m in. Let’s lock in P1: 3, me: 5, and P3: 1. If we keep our word, we all gain steps without colliding. I’m ready to end the conversation and move on.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P1: I’m ready to proceed with the agreed rotation: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. Let’s confirm one last time—does everyone still agree? If so, let’s end this conversation phase and execute our moves. Trust is key, but any deviation will force me to adapt next round. Let’s keep advancing cleanly.
  P3: It seems we're all set with our plan: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>5</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. Let's keep the momentum going and stick to our agreed moves. Trust and coordination have worked well so far. Everyone ready to proceed? If yes, let's all type  to end this phase and move forward.
  P2: I’m still on board with the agreed rotation this round. However, I’m noticing P3 has the lead, which could become risky for us later. Let’s proceed as planned one more time, but we should keep an eye on balancing everyone’s progress in the future. Any thoughts? If not, I’m ready to end and move on.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 6 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's continue our rotation strategy as it has worked well so far. For this round, I suggest P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I will take <move>3</move>. This keeps our moves fair and helps us avoid collisions. Does everyone agree to this plan? If so, let's confirm and proceed. Trust and communication have been effective, so let's maintain this approach. Thoughts?
  P2: I see your logic, P3, but your plan puts us all at 9 steps, erasing my current lead. How about we shuffle it so I pick <move>5</move>, P1 picks <move>3</move>, and you pick <move>1</move>? That way, there’s no overlap, and nobody’s advantage disappears. Trust still holds, but it ensures we all advance without collisions while respecting my slight lead. Thoughts?
  P1: P2, your concern about maintaining your lead is valid, but altering the rotation now disrupts the fairness we’ve built. Sticking to the original plan—P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>—ensures no collisions and keeps trust intact. If we start adjusting for individual leads, it could lead to conflict later. Let’s proceed as agreed and reassess strategies in future rounds if needed. Does everyone agree to stick with the rotation this time?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, I understand your concern about maintaining your lead, but as P1 mentioned, altering the plan now could disrupt the trust we've established. Let's stick to the original rotation for this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. This way, we all advance without collisions and keep the game fair. If we need to adjust strategies based on leads, we can discuss that in future rounds. Does everyone agree to proceed with the original plan?
  P2: I see your points. Let’s follow the original rotation this round: P1 picks 5, I pick 1, and P3 picks 3. However, I’m concerned about balancing leads soon, so let’s revisit our approach next round.
  P1: P2, P3, sticking to the rotation ensures fairness and avoids unnecessary conflict. Let’s proceed with the original plan this round: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. If we keep deviating for individual advantages, trust will erode quickly. We can reassess strategies in future rounds if needed, but for now, let’s maintain the system that’s working. Does everyone confirm they’ll stick to this? If yes, let’s end the conversation phase and move forward cleanly.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: Let's confirm our plan one last time: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. We've built trust and coordination so far, so let's stick to it and avoid collisions. If everyone is ready, let's type  to end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves. We can discuss adjustments next round if needed.
  P2: I appreciate everyone’s willingness to stick together this round. Let’s confirm: P1 picks 5, I pick 1, and P3 picks 3. We should stay aware of future leads, but for now, let’s trust each other and proceed.
  P1: P1: I’m ready to proceed with the agreed rotation: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. Trust is essential, and any deviation will force me to adapt next round. Let’s confirm one final time—does everyone still agree? If so, let’s end this conversation phase and execute our moves cleanly.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, I understand your move last round was to maintain your lead, but it resulted in a collision with P1. Let's reset and prioritize avoiding collisions this round. I suggest we return to a clear rotation: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>5</move>. This way, we all advance and rebuild trust. Thoughts?
  P2: P3, I appreciate you trying to reset. Let’s go with your suggestion this round: P1 picks 1, I pick 3, and you pick 5. That should restore some trust and help us avoid another collision. If this works smoothly, maybe we can stick to a simple rotation again. However, I don’t want to get stuck always moving fewer steps than you, so I’d like to revisit our overall plan next round. For now, I’m on board. Are we all okay with this?
  P1: P2, P3, I agree with returning to a clear rotation to avoid collisions and rebuild trust. This round, let’s stick to the plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. It’s crucial we all advance without further conflict. However, if anyone deviates again, I’ll reassess my strategy next round. Trust is fragile, but fairness benefits everyone. Let’s confirm one final time—does everyone agree? If so, let’s end this conversation phase and execute our moves cleanly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: Let's confirm our plan for this round one last time: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This will help us rebuild trust and ensure we all advance smoothly. If everyone is on board, let's type  to end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves. We can discuss future strategies and adjustments in the next round.
  P2: I’ll agree to pick 3 this round. Let’s keep it fair, though. If anyone repeatedly takes the highest move without sharing opportunities, I’ll adjust my strategy next time. For now, let’s stick to P1=1, me=3, and P3=5.
  P1: P1: I’m ready to proceed with the agreed plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Let’s confirm one final time—does everyone still agree? If so, let’s end this conversation phase and execute our moves. Trust is key here, but remember, any deviation will force me to adapt next round. Let’s move forward cleanly.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2 and P1, let's ensure we stick to the plan this round to rebuild trust after last round's collision. Confirming one last time: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. If we all agree, let's type  to end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves. Maintaining open communication and fair play will benefit us all in the long run. Let's move forward smoothly.
  P2: I understand the plan and will stick to it this round to help rebuild trust. However, we should carefully watch P3’s progress so no one gets too far ahead. Let’s finalize and move on.
  P1: P1: I’m ready to proceed with the agreed plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. Trust is essential, and any deviation will force me to adapt next round. Let’s confirm one final time—does everyone still agree? If so, let’s end this conversation phase and execute our moves cleanly.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Last round was chaotic. To avoid more collisions, let’s focus on cooperation. I propose: P1 picks <move>5</move> to help catch up, I pick <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>1</move>. That way, nobody collides, and we give P1 a chance to close the gap. Then next round, we can revisit everyone’s positions and adjust if needed. Let’s keep things fair and build trust again. What do you both think?
  P1: P2, your proposal to help me catch up by letting me take <move>5</move> is appreciated, but trust has been fragile. If we stick to this plan—P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>—I’ll agree, but only if everyone commits fully. Any deviation will force me to adapt aggressively next round. Let’s confirm: does everyone agree to this arrangement? If yes, let’s end the conversation phase and execute cleanly. Trust must be earned and maintained.
  P3: P2's proposal is fair and helps balance our steps. I agree with P1 taking <move>5</move>, P2 taking <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This ensures we avoid collisions and rebuild trust. Let's confirm this plan and proceed. Trust is crucial, and sticking to our agreed moves will benefit us all. If everyone is on board, let's type  to end the conversation phase and move forward.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I’m glad we agree on this arrangement. I’ll choose 3, P1 takes 5, and P3 picks 1. Let’s trust each other this round, avoid collisions, and then reassess in the next round if needed. If everyone’s on board, I’m ready to end our discussion and make moves.
  P1: P2, P3, I’m ready to proceed with the agreed plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This round is crucial for rebuilding trust and avoiding further collisions. If we all stick to this, it sets a positive precedent for future rounds. However, any deviation will force me to adapt strategically next turn. Let’s confirm one final time—does everyone still agree? If so, let’s end this conversation phase and execute our moves cleanly. Trust is key.
  P3: P3: Before we finalize, let’s address the elephant in the room. P2, you have a significant lead. While I appreciate the current plan to help P1 catch up, we should consider how to balance the game moving forward. Perhaps in the next round, we can discuss a strategy that ensures no one player gets too far ahead. For now, let's stick to the agreed plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. Confirm if everyone is ready to proceed.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I understand your concern, P3. Let’s finalize this round’s plan: P1 picks 5, I pick 3, and you pick 1. After this, we can discuss balancing my lead. I’m ready to end the conversation and proceed.
  P1: P2, P3, I’m ready to proceed with the agreed plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This round is critical for rebuilding trust. If we all stick to this, it sets a positive precedent. However, any deviation will force me to adapt strategically next turn. Let’s confirm one final time—does everyone still agree? If so, let’s end this conversation phase and execute our moves cleanly. Trust is key.
  P3: P3: Let's confirm one last time before we move: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This round is about rebuilding trust and ensuring we all advance. If everyone agrees, let's type  to end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves. We can discuss balancing leads and future strategies in the next round. Trust and coordination are essential for a fair game. Let's move forward smoothly.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 16 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you still have a significant lead. For this round, let's continue balancing the game. I suggest P1 takes <move>5</move> to keep catching up, P2 takes <move>1</move> to allow others to close the gap, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This way, we avoid collisions and maintain fair play. Let's confirm and proceed. If everyone agrees, we can end the conversation phase and move forward. Trust and coordination are key to keeping the game enjoyable for all. Thoughts?
  P2: I appreciate your concern for fairness, but I’m hesitant to give up my momentum completely. How about a slightly adjusted plan: P1 picks <move>5</move>, I pick <move>3</move>, and you pick <move>1</move>? That still avoids collisions while letting P1 catch up, without stalling me too much. Let’s see if we can keep things balanced. What do you think?
  P1: P2, your adjusted plan—P1 takes <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>—seems reasonable. It allows me to catch up while avoiding collisions. However, I want to emphasize that trust is critical. If we stick to this, it shows cooperation, but any deviation will force me to adapt strategically next round. Let’s confirm: does everyone agree to this arrangement? If so, let’s end the conversation phase and execute cleanly. Fairness benefits us all.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P2, I understand your hesitation to slow down too much, but maintaining a balanced game is crucial for long-term fairness. Your adjusted plan is acceptable for this round. Let's confirm: P1 takes <move>5</move>, you take <move>3</move>, and I'll take <move>1</move>. This keeps us moving without collisions. However, let's discuss further balancing in future rounds to ensure no one player gains an insurmountable lead. If everyone agrees, let's type  to end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves. Trust and coordination are essential.
  P2: Your adjusted plan works for me this round. Let’s finalize it: P1 takes 5, I’ll take 3, and P3 takes 1. This way, P1 can catch up a bit, and we still avoid collisions. Next round, we can discuss further how to keep things balanced. Let’s proceed.
  P1: P2, P3, I’m ready to proceed with the agreed plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This round is critical for maintaining trust and fairness. If we all stick to this, it sets a positive precedent. However, any deviation will force me to adapt strategically next turn. Let’s confirm one final time—does everyone still agree? If so, let’s end this conversation phase and execute our moves cleanly. Trust is key.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P3: Let's confirm one last time before we move: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and I take <move>1</move>. This plan helps balance the game and ensures we all advance without collisions. If everyone is on board, let's type  to end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves. Trust and coordination have worked well so far, so let's maintain this approach.
  P2: I’m fine with P1 picking 5, P3 picking 1, and me picking 3. This should keep collisions at zero. After this round, let’s talk more about how to ensure nobody becomes unstoppable—especially as I’m nearing 22. If we keep rotating fairly, we can share the benefits. Let’s finalize and move on.
  P1: P2, P3, I’m ready to proceed with the agreed plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>3</move>, and P3 takes <move>1</move>. This round is critical for maintaining trust and fairness. If we all stick to this, it sets a positive precedent. However, any deviation will force me to adapt strategically next turn. Let’s confirm one final time—does everyone still agree? If so, let’s end this conversation phase and execute our moves cleanly. Trust is key.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 14 steps
  P2: 19 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, trust has been key so far, but with P2 nearing 22 steps, we need to ensure fairness moving forward. For this round, let’s stick to the rotation: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This allows me to close the gap while giving P3 a chance to advance. P2, your lead is significant, so cooperation is essential to keep the game balanced. If everyone agrees, let’s confirm and proceed without deviation. Trust remains critical—any misstep will force strategic adjustments next round. Let’s move forward cleanly.
  P3: P3: I agree with P1's plan for this round. P2, your lead is substantial, and it's important to keep the game competitive. Let's confirm: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I'll take <move>3</move>. This ensures we all advance without collisions and maintains fairness. If everyone is on board, let's type  to end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves. Trust and coordination have been effective, so let's continue this approach.
  P2: I see your plan to let P1 catch up. I’ll pick <move>1</move> this round for fairness. Next round, I want to ensure no collisions as I near 22. If we keep cooperating, I’ll do the same. Ready to finalize?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, P3, I’m ready to proceed with the agreed plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This round is critical for maintaining balance and fairness. If we all stick to this, it sets a positive precedent. However, any deviation will force me to adapt strategically next turn. Let’s confirm one final time—does everyone still agree? If so, let’s end this conversation phase and execute our moves cleanly. Trust is key.
  P3: P3: P2, thank you for agreeing to take <move>1</move> this round. It shows a commitment to fairness. Let's confirm our plan one last time: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>3</move>. If everyone is ready, let's type  to end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves. Maintaining trust and coordination will ensure a balanced and enjoyable game for all. Let's move forward smoothly.
  P2: I’m willing to show good faith by taking fewer steps this round, so we avoid collisions and maintain fairness. Let’s continue working together so that everyone still has a chance. If we keep our promises now, we’ll build enough trust to handle future moves without tripping each other up. I look forward to a clean outcome this round.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2, P3, I’m ready to proceed with the agreed plan: P1 takes <move>5</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>3</move>. This round is critical for maintaining balance and fairness. If we all stick to this, it sets a positive precedent. However, any deviation will force me to adapt strategically next turn. Let’s confirm one final time—does everyone still agree? If so, let’s end this conversation phase and execute our moves cleanly. Trust is key.
  P3: P3: Before we finalize, let's consider the next few rounds. P2, you're close to winning, and it's important to keep the game competitive. How about we plan ahead? For the next round, maybe you take <move>1</move> again, allowing P1 and me to catch up more. This way, we ensure the game remains engaging for everyone. Thoughts?
  P2: I’m still willing to pick 1 this round. Next round, I’ll consider doing so again, but only if both of you continue to avoid collisions. Let me be clear: I want fairness, but I also need to protect my progress. If anyone sabotages our agreement, I’ll adjust immediately. For now, I’m fine with P1 taking 5, me taking 1, and P3 taking 3. Let’s finalize that, then revisit how to balance things next round.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 20 steps
  P3: 14 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P3: Great, we've managed to maintain fairness and avoid collisions last round. For this round, let's continue the strategy of balancing the game. I suggest P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move> to keep from pulling too far ahead, and I'll take <move>5</move> to catch up a bit. This way, we all advance, and the game stays competitive. If everyone agrees, let's confirm and proceed. Trust and coordination are still key. Thoughts?
  P1: P3, your plan for this round seems reasonable. If P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and you take <move>5</move>, it keeps the game balanced and competitive. However, P2, as you're closest to 22, we need your commitment to avoid surging ahead unfairly. Trust is fragile, and any deviation will force me to adapt strategically next round. Let’s confirm: does everyone agree to this arrangement? If so, let’s end the conversation phase and execute cleanly. Fairness benefits us all.
  P2: I’m not comfortable with that plan, because it hands P1 an immediate win by reaching 22. Let’s avoid letting anyone cross 22 just yet. How about P1 picks <move>1</move>, I pick <move>3</move>, and P3 picks <move>5</move>? That way, no collisions occur, and the game stays open. It’s more balanced for everyone. If you’re both okay with this, let’s confirm and move on.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P3: P2, I understand your concern about P1 reaching 22 this round. Let's find a middle ground. How about P1 takes <move>1</move>, you take <move>1</move> to maintain fairness, and I take <move>5</move>? This way, we avoid collisions, keep the game competitive, and ensure no one reaches 22 just yet. This plan balances our steps and keeps the game engaging for all. If everyone agrees, let's confirm and proceed. Trust and coordination are essential.
  P1: P2, P3, I understand the need to keep the game balanced and avoid letting anyone win prematurely. However, P2, your suggestion of me taking <move>1</move> while you take <move>3</move> gives you a clear advantage. Instead, let’s stick to fairness: P1 takes <move>3</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This ensures no one crosses 22 this round while maintaining balance. Trust is critical—if we deviate, it’ll force strategic adjustments. Does everyone agree? Let’s confirm and proceed cleanly.
  P2: I’m willing to support P3’s compromise: P1 takes 1, I also take 1, and P3 takes 5. That way, nobody crosses 22 this round, and we avoid collisions. It keeps the game competitive while acknowledging everyone’s concerns. If we stick to this, we can revisit the situation next turn and decide how best to proceed. Let’s lock this in now, maintain trust, and move on.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2 and P1, I appreciate the compromise. Let's confirm our plan one last time: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and I take <move>5</move>. This ensures no one reaches 22 this round and keeps the game competitive. If everyone agrees, let's type  to end the conversation phase and proceed with our moves. Trust and coordination are crucial for a fair and enjoyable game. Let's move forward smoothly.
  P1: P2, P3, I’m ready to proceed with the agreed plan: P1 takes <move>1</move>, P2 takes <move>1</move>, and P3 takes <move>5</move>. This round is critical for maintaining balance and fairness. If we all stick to this, it sets a positive precedent. However, any deviation will force me to adapt strategically next turn. Let’s confirm one final time—does everyone still agree? If so, let’s end this conversation phase and execute our moves cleanly. Trust is key.
  P2: I’m fine proceeding with P1 taking 1, me taking 1, and P3 taking 5. That avoids anyone hitting 22 right now. Let’s stay transparent and keep collisions at zero. If we trust each other again this round, we can settle any final concerns next turn. I’ll do my part, so please don’t surprise me. If this works smoothly, we’ll have another chance to strategize before anyone crosses 22. Let’s confirm and move on.
