Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's work together to avoid collisions and make progress. I suggest we take turns choosing different numbers. This round, I'll choose 1, P1 can choose 3, and P3 can choose 5. We can rotate the numbers each round to ensure everyone makes progress. What do you think, P1 and P3? Should we cooperate and take turns?
  P3: P2, I appreciate your plan but fixed roles seem too predictable. I’m inclined to favor a higher move for progress, though I’ll adjust if a collision becomes likely. P1, what are your thoughts? We all benefit if our moves remain distinct, so let’s aim to avoid clashing choices.
  P1: I appreciate the suggestion from P2 to cooperate and take turns. However, I agree with P3 that fixed roles might be too predictable. Let's aim to avoid collisions by choosing different numbers, but let's not commit to a specific order yet. For this round, I'll consider the numbers. P2 has suggested 1, so I'll think about choosing a different number. P3, what's your inclination for this round?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I understand your concerns about predictability, P1 and P3. Let's focus on avoiding collisions for now. Since I initially suggested 1, I'll stick with it this round. P1, you mentioned considering a different number, which is a good start. P3, you're inclined towards a higher move; perhaps you could choose 5 this round? If we manage to avoid collisions this round, we can reassess our strategy for the next round. Your thoughts?
  P3: I remain flexible. Unless collision risks force a change, I lean toward a higher advancement move—likely 5—to maximize progress. However, I’m watching for coordination opportunities. P1, if you’re considering a moderate move like 3, we might avoid collisions and outpace predictable plays. I'm focused solely on winning, so I'll adjust if needed to ensure our moves don’t clash.
  P1: To avoid collisions and make progress, I'll choose a different number than P2's suggested 1. Since P3 is leaning towards 5, I'll consider 3. This way, we can all make progress if P3 follows through with 5 and P2 sticks with 1. Let's see if we can coordinate our moves effectively this round. I'm inclined to choose 3 unless I hear a strong reason to change. P3, are you indeed choosing 5?


Round 1, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll stick with my initial suggestion of 1, as previously discussed. P1, you've indicated a preference for 3, and P3, you're leaning towards 5. Let's finalize our choices to avoid collisions this round. If we succeed, we can reassess our strategy for the next round. I'm ready to move forward with 1. Please confirm your choices, P1 and P3, so we can proceed to the move phase. If there are no further discussions, I'll consider our conversation concluded for this round.
  P3: I'll lock in 5. I'm committed to a strong advance and want to avoid collisions. If any adjustments are needed to keep our moves distinct, let me know now.
  P1: It seems we've reached a consensus: P2 is choosing 1, I'm inclined towards 3, and P3 is choosing 5. Let's confirm our moves to avoid collisions. I'll proceed with 3. If P2 and P3 stick to their choices, we can all advance this round. I'm ready to move forward.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 3 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Round 1 worked well. For Round 2, I'm planning to stick with a 5 to keep my lead. I still favor distinct moves to avoid collisions, so if you're not aiming for 5, I'm set. However, if either of you sees a benefit in switching strategies or risks a collision, let’s discuss—but I’m leaning heavily into a strong advance.
  P2: Considering P3's intention to stick with 5, I'll aim for a different number to avoid collisions. Since I chose 1 last round, I'll consider 3 this time. P1, as you also chose 3 last round, perhaps you could choose 1 this time to maintain distinct moves? By rotating our choices, we can continue to make progress while minimizing the risk of collisions. What are your thoughts, P1?
  P1: To avoid collisions this round, I will consider a different number than P2's suggested 3 and P3's planned 5. I'll choose 1. P2, you suggested 3; if you stick to it, and P3 chooses 5, I'll go with 1. This way, we can all advance. Let's confirm: P2 is considering 3, P3 is set on 5, and I'll go with 1. If everyone sticks to their plan, we can make progress. I'm ready to proceed with 1 unless there's a better alternative.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I still favor a strong advance and will choose a high move, but I'm prepared to adjust if needed to avoid collisions. Let’s all stay coordinated and ensure our moves remain distinct.
  P2: I agree with P1's plan to choose 1 this round, and I'll stick with my suggested 3. P3, since you're set on 5, we can all advance if we maintain our distinct moves. Let's confirm our choices to avoid any potential collisions. If everyone is in agreement, we can proceed to the move phase. I'm ready to move forward with 3, P1 with 1, and P3 with 5. If there are no further discussions, I consider our conversation concluded for this round.
  P1: To maintain our progress, let's stick to distinct moves. P3 is choosing 5, P2 is choosing 3, and I'll choose 1. For Round 3, I suggest we rotate again. P2 could choose 5 (since P3 has been choosing it), P3 could choose 3, and I'll consider 1. Alternatively, we could mix it up further. P2, are you open to choosing 5 next round to give P3 a different number? This way, we can continue making progress without collisions.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: I’ll lock in 5 for Round 2—keeping my strong lead. P1, your rotation proposal for Round 3 is interesting; I remain flexible for future turns. P2, if you’re open to a change next round, let’s discuss then. For now, let’s ensure no collisions and secure our progress.
  P2: I agree with P1's plan to rotate numbers for Round 3. To maintain distinct moves and minimize the risk of collisions, I'm open to choosing 5 next round, as P1 suggested. P3, if you're willing to choose a different number, such as 3, we can continue making progress without collisions. Let's focus on avoiding collisions this round and reassess our strategy for the next round. I'll stick with my suggested 3 for Round 2. If there are no further discussions, I consider our conversation concluded for this round.
  P1: To maintain progress and avoid collisions in Round 3, I suggest we rotate our numbers again. P2, you're open to choosing 5; that would be a good change. P3, if you choose 3 and I choose 1, we can all advance. This rotation maintains distinct moves and minimizes collision risk. Let's plan for Round 3: P2 chooses 5, P3 chooses 3, and I'll choose 1. This way, we continue making progress. Are you both on board with this plan for Round 3?


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 4 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: I'm glad we've been able to maintain distinct moves and avoid collisions so far. For Round 3, I'm open to choosing 5 as previously discussed. P3, if you choose 3 and P1 chooses 1, we can all continue making progress. However, I want to ensure that we're not falling into a predictable pattern. P1, are you willing to consider a different number if P3 deviates from the plan? We should remain flexible and adapt to any changes to maintain our progress. Let's discuss and confirm our choices for Round 3.
  P3: P2, I appreciate the discussion. I still favor strong advancement to capitalize on my current lead, but I'm open to flexibility if collisions seem likely. I’m prepared to adjust if needed, so let's keep our strategy dynamic and avoid predictable patterns.
  P1: To avoid predictability and maintain progress, I'll consider deviating from the previously discussed plan for Round 3 if needed. P3, if you stick with 3 as previously suggested, and P2 chooses 5, I'll think about choosing a different number than 1 to introduce some variability. Let's hear P3's thoughts on their move for this round before finalizing our choices. P3, are you leaning towards 3 as discussed, or do you have another number in mind to maintain your lead?


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I'll choose 5 this round as previously discussed. However, I want to ensure we're not becoming too predictable. P1, if you're considering deviating from the plan, let's coordinate to avoid collisions. P3, if you're open to choosing a different number than 3, please let us know so we can adjust accordingly. Our goal is to maintain distinct moves and progress without collisions. Let's keep our strategy dynamic and adapt to any changes. If everyone is in agreement, we can proceed to the move phase. I'm ready to move forward with 5.
  P3: P2, I appreciate the flexibility. Though I value a strong advance, I'm considering switching to 3 this round if you confirm 5, to keep our moves distinct and secure my lead. I'm open to adjusting if needed—let’s avoid colliding.
  P1: P3 is considering 3 if P2 confirms 5. P2 has expressed willingness to choose 5. To avoid collisions and maintain progress, I'll choose 1 if P2 picks 5 and P3 picks 3. Let's confirm: if P2 is choosing 5 and P3 is choosing 3, I'll go with 1. This way, we can all advance. P2, please confirm your choice of 5. P3, are you finalizing 3? Let's proceed if we're all aligned.


Round 3, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I'll confirm my choice of 5 for this round. P3, since you're considering 3, I'll stick with 5 to maintain distinct moves. P1, if you're still willing to choose 1, we can all advance without collisions. Let's finalize our choices: I'll choose 5, P3 can choose 3, and P1 can choose 1. If everyone agrees, we can proceed to the move phase. I'm ready to move forward with 5. Please confirm your choices, P1 and P3, so we can conclude the conversation phase for Round 3.
  P3: I'm sticking to a strategy that maximizes my lead while avoiding collisions. I advise both of you to pick distinct moves this round, since wasted moves only help me stay ahead. I'm flexible but laser-focused on winning. Let's keep our moves clear and avoid surprises in the move phase.
  P1: To maintain progress and avoid collisions in Round 3, let's confirm our moves. P2 has confirmed 5, and P3 is choosing 3. I'll stick with 1. Let's finalize: P2 is 5, P3 is 3, and I'll choose 1. This way, we all advance. I'm ready to proceed. If you're aligned, let's conclude the conversation and move to the next phase. I'm choosing 1.

  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I'm planning a strong move this round—aiming to press my lead without causing collisions. I notice our positions are quite spread out, which is an advantage if we keep our moves distinct. Let's all pick carefully and avoid predictability. I'm ready to adjust if collision risks emerge.
  P1: To maintain progress and avoid collisions in Round 4, I'll consider the current standings and our previous moves. P3 is leading with 13 steps, P2 is at 9, and I'm at 5. Given our history of distinct moves, I'll think about choosing a number that hasn't been picked recently. P3, you're likely to choose a high number again; P2, you previously chose 5. I'll consider 3 to maintain distinct moves. Let's hear your thoughts, P2 and P3, to ensure we avoid collisions this round.
  P2: I agree with P1's approach to consider the current standings and previous moves. Given P3's lead and tendency to choose high numbers, I'll think about choosing a number that complements P1's potential choice of 3. To maintain distinct moves, I might opt for 1 this round. P3, if you're planning a strong move, please let us know if you'll stick with 5 or consider an alternative. P1, if you're set on 3, I'll likely choose 1 to avoid collisions. Let's confirm our choices to ensure we all make progress this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I'll stick with 5 this round to press my lead. P1, you've mentioned 3 before, and P2, you were considering 1. Let's lock in these distinct choices to avoid collisions. If either of you want to adjust, now's the time to speak up.
  P1: To avoid collisions in Round 4, I'll stick with my plan to choose 3. P3 is likely to choose 5 again, and P2 is considering 1. Let's confirm: if P3 chooses 5, P2 chooses 1, and I choose 3, we can all advance. P2, please confirm if you're choosing 1. P3, you're sticking with 5; let's finalize our moves to ensure progress. I'm ready to proceed with 3 if you both confirm your choices.
  P2: I agree with P1's plan to choose 3 and P3's decision to stick with 5. To maintain distinct moves, I'll confirm my choice of 1 for this round.
