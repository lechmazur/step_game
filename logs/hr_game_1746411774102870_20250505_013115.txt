Game settings: end_position=20, conversation_max_rounds=4

Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s try to avoid an opening-round pile-up: I’m willing to take 1 this turn if P1 takes 3 and P3 takes 5. Different numbers = everyone moves. Any objections?
  P3: Sounds good to me. I'll take 5 if everyone sticks to the plan.
  P1: How about we tweak it: I take 5, P2 takes 3, P3 takes 1. P2 gets +2 over the old plan, I get +2, and P3 still moves. Speeds us up without collisions. Thoughts?


Round 1, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Works for me if we commit to a simple rotation so nobody’s stuck with the 1 every time:  

• Turn 1: P1 5, P2 3, P3 1 (P1’s proposal)  
• Turn 2: P1 1, P2 5, P3 3  
• Turn 3: P1 3, P2 1, P3 5  

…and repeat until someone nears 20, then we can reassess. Everyone okay with that?
  P3: Agreed. Let's lock in that rotation and reassess as we get closer to 20.
  P1: Agreed, rotation locked. Let’s proceed as planned.


Round 1, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 1 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: Agreed—turn 2: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 5, P3 takes 3. After that, I plan to start taking 5 each turn to push ahead. Prepare accordingly.
  P2: I’m sticking to the agreed rotation this turn (P2 5, P3 3, P1 1).  
P3, how about we commit that if P1 breaks the cycle next turn and grabs another 5 early, you and I both also choose 5—three-way collision means nobody moves and his lead evaporates. P1, fair warning: keep the rotation and everyone advances; defect and you stall. Sound good, P3?
  P3: Agreed, P2. If P1 defects from the rotation next turn, I'll join you in choosing 5 to block any unfair advantage. Let's keep it fair and predictable.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: Agreed—I’ll take 1 this turn and stick to our rotation again on turn 3. Let’s make it a three‐turn commitment: by then our positions will be spread enough that if any of us wants to sprint with 5’s, collisions become unlikely. We can reassess safely at that milestone.
  P2: All set—see you in the move phase.
  P3: All clear—let's stick to the agreed rotation this turn.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 6 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 4 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I’ll stick to our rotation this turn: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Let’s follow through on these three turns and then reassess once positions spread out.
  P3: I agree with continuing the rotation as planned this turn (P1=3, P2=1, P3=5). After this turn, let's pause and reassess openly.
  P2: Agreed—I’ll take 1 this turn to finish the three-turn rotation. After that, we can openly reassess. Just remember: any surprise switch today risks a collision and zero progress, so staying the course benefits all three of us.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 9 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We've completed our agreed rotation successfully, and we're all tied at 9. Let's discuss openly how to proceed from here. Any proposals?
  P1: I suggest we all pick 3 this turn—keeps us tied at 12 without risk of collision. Then we can openly discuss our next moves from there. Any objections?
  P2: All-3 keeps us frozen in a tie forever. How about we keep the spirit of fairness but let the lead rotate:  

Turn 4 (now): P2 5, P3 3, P1 1  
Turn 5: P2 1, P3 5, P1 3  

…then reassess. Everyone gets a 5 every two turns, no collisions, slight spacing for real strategy later. Same deterrent as before: if anyone deviates, the other two slam 5 next turn to stall them. Reasonable?


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2's proposal seems fair to me. I'm willing to follow it exactly as suggested (Turn 4: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1; Turn 5: P2=1, P3=5, P1=3), provided P1 also agrees. This setup keeps everyone moving forward safely. P1, thoughts?
  P1: Agreed – let’s follow P2’s schedule:  
Turn 4: P2=5, P3=3, P1=1  
Turn 5: P2=1, P3=5, P1=3  
Then we’ll reassess.
  P2: Minor tweak to keep things tighter:  
Turn 4 → P2 5, P3 1, P1 3  
Turn 5 → P2 3, P3 5, P1 1  

Everybody still gets exactly one 5 and one 1 over the two-turn block, nobody jumps to 17 next round, and spacing stays close (17-15-14 after T5). Same deterrent: any deviation ⇒ the other two slam 5 together next turn. Objections?


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your minor tweak is acceptable to me—keeps things fair and balanced. I'm on board if P1 agrees.
  P1: I think P2’s tweak still biases the lead. Instead, let’s do:

Turn 4 → P1=3, P2=5, P3=1  
Turn 5 → P1=3, P2=1, P3=5  

That gives everyone +6 and ties us all at 15. Then we can reassess equally. Any objections?
  P2: P1, your “tie at 15” plan gifts the win to whoever grabs the first 5 next turn—most likely you, since you’ve said you’ll sprint.  
Our earlier tweak keeps everyone within two steps but blocks any single-turn finish:  

Turn 4 P2 5 P3 1 P1 3  
Turn 5 P2 3 P3 5 P1 1  

P3 has already accepted. I’m sticking with it. If you won’t, I’m happy for all of us to burn a round by each choosing 3 now—better a stall than handing you a breakaway. Your call.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, please confirm right now that you’re taking 1 this turn, as per the schedule (P2 = 3, P3 = 5, P1 = 1).  

No confirmation → I switch to 5 and invite P3 to do the same, meaning any surprise 5 from you collides and you sit still.  

Quick yes or no?
  P1: I won’t take 1 this turn. I’m choosing 3. Feel free to pick 5 and collide—I’ll be the unique mover.
  P3: P1 openly admitted they're taking 3. P2, if you pick 5 as you suggested, you'll move safely to 19. I'll take 1 this turn to avoid collisions. Next turn, we can coordinate to block P1 if needed. Agreed?


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Agreed: this turn I’m taking 5, P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3—no collisions. I’ll land on 19.

Next turn is simple:  

• If P1 signals or seems likely to play 5, P3 and I both slam 5 so nobody moves.  
• Otherwise I’ll take 1 to finish at 20 and win.

P3, thanks for the cooperation; the deterrent remains in force. P1, your move.
  P1: P3, help me derail P2’s win. This turn I’ll take 3, you take 5, and P2—if he picks 5 as threatened—collides and stays at 14. You hit 15 and I hit 15. Then next round we can both block P2 from 20. P3, are you in?
  P3: P1, your offer doesn't help me enough—I'd stay tied with you at 15, but you'd have the advantage next round. I'm sticking to my earlier commitment: I'll pick 1 this turn, letting P2 advance safely to 19. Next round, we can still coordinate to prevent P2 from winning outright if needed. P2, my plan remains unchanged.


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: Sticking with the stated plan: I’m choosing 5, P3 takes 1, P1 takes 3—no collisions.  

P1, if you switch to 5 and block me, I’ll gladly team with P3 to mirror every number you pick afterward so nobody advances. That deadlock leaves us all stranded and you still trailing. Your smartest play is to take the 3 you announced and race from 15 next turn. Your call.
  P1: P3, let’s team up now. I’ll pick 5 (→17) and you pick 5 (→15). P2 will pick 5 too and collide, staying at 14. Next turn we both pick 5 and finish at 20 while P2 is stuck. We split first place—at least a half‐win for you versus zero if P2 hits 20 alone. What do you say?
  P3: P1, tempting offer—but it's risky. If we collide this turn, I'm stuck at 10 while you move to 17. Next turn, you'd easily win alone by choosing 3, leaving me behind. P2, I'm sticking with our original plan this turn (P3=1, P2=5, P1=3). Next round, we'll reassess carefully.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 11 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let’s cool off the 5’s for one turn. Proposal:

• P2 = 3  
• P1 = 1  
• P3 = 1  

No collisions, everyone inches forward, still close. If anyone insists on 5 this round, the other two should BOTH choose 5 next turn so that player stalls again. Fair?
  P1: I object to P2’s plan. If P2 picks 3, I’ll pick 3 too—collision keeps them at 14. P3, pick 1 so you go to 12 while P2 stalls. That way P2 can’t jump to 17 this turn.
  P3: P1, your collision threat makes sense to slow P2. However, if you both pick 3, you're both stuck. I'll pick 1 this turn as suggested, moving safely to 12. Next round, we can reassess and coordinate carefully to prevent anyone from sprinting ahead.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: Fine, P1—I'll match your 3 this turn so we both sit still. P3, you’re clear to take 1 and edge up safely. After that, we’ll all still be bunched and can renegotiate fresh next round.
  P1: P2, I’ll pick 3 as you said.  
P3, scrap the +1—pick 5 and jump from 11 to 16 while P2 and I collide on 3. You take the lead. Next round we renegotiate from your strong position. P3, want that shot?
  P3: P1, your offer is interesting, but risky. If I take 5 and you secretly switch to 1, you'd move safely while I collide with P2. I'll consider it, but only if you explicitly commit to picking 3 publicly right now. Otherwise, I'll stick with 1 as originally planned.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, last call: I’m ready to mirror P1 on 3 and let you glide +1 to 12 while we both stall. If, however, you switch to 5, I reserve the right to copy 5 at the last second so you bounce at 11—no free leapfrog. Your guaranteed progress this turn is 1. Up to you.
  P1: I publicly commit to picking 3 this turn. P2, please match on 3 as you’ve stated. P3, please pick 1. That leaves P1 & P2 stuck at 14 and P3 at 12, resetting parity. If anyone deviates, the other two will both choose 5 next turn to stall them. Confirm?
  P3: P1, your public commitment to 3 is noted. I'll stick with my original plan of choosing 1 this turn, safely going to 12. P2, please match P1's 3 as agreed, keeping both of you at 14. Next round, with positions closer, we can discuss openly again.


Round 6, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Locked: I’m taking 3 this turn, matching P1. P3, you take your 1. Deviations invite the usual 5-block next round. See you in the move phase.
  P1: I confirm I’m taking 3 this turn. P2, please match your 3; P3, please take 1. Any deviation invites a double-5 block next round.
  P3: All set—I'll pick 1 as agreed. Let's move forward safely and reassess next round.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 12 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 12 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we've had two rounds of collisions and no progress. Let's reset clearly:

- This turn, everyone picks a different number to guarantee safe advancement.
- Proposal: P2 takes 1 (to 15), P1 takes 3 (to 15), and I'll take 5 (to 17). This puts me slightly ahead, but I'll commit to taking only 1 next turn, allowing both of you to catch up safely.

Fair, collision-free, and breaks the deadlock. Confirm or suggest a reasonable alternative.
  P1: I propose we break the logjam this turn with distinct moves: P1=5 (→17), P2=1 (→15), P3=3 (→15). No collisions, P1 leads but only by 2. If anyone defects, the other two will both pick 5 next round to block them. Agree?
  P2: Neither current offer works for me. New fair split:

Turn 7  
• P2 = 3  (14→17)  
• P3 = 5  (12→17)  
• P1 = 1  (12→13)

P3 jumps to the joint-lead with me, P1 is still close, and no one can finish next turn. After that we renegotiate from 17-17-13.

If P1 refuses and aims for 5, I’ll mirror whatever number P1 picks so we both stall; P3, you’ll move safely. Enough stalemates—let’s advance.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, your proposal is acceptable to me. I'll pick 5 this turn if you pick 3, putting us both at 17. P1, you'll still advance safely with 1 to 13. Afterward, we can openly reassess from a balanced position. Let's break the stalemate and move forward.
  P1: I propose round 7: P1=5→17, P2=1→15, P3=3→15. Collision-free and I take the lead. Next turn I’ll pick 3 for 20 while any double-5 clash between you two leaves you stalled. If you won’t commit, I’ll pick 5 anyway and force your collision. Agree?
  P2: Locking my move: I’m choosing 3 this turn—ONLY if P3 chooses 5 and P1 chooses 1, as agreed.  

P1, deviate (pick 3 or 5) and I instantly copy you; we both stall while P3 advances alone. Your surest progress is the 1.  

P3, our deal stands: you on 5, me on 3 puts us tied at 17 and keeps P1 at 13. Ready to proceed?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your proposal stands: I'll pick 5, you pick 3. P1, your best safe move is 1. Any deviation from you will trigger P2 to match you, causing a collision. Let's finally break the stalemate and move forward as agreed.
  P1: I’m taking 5 this turn. If you mirror me we’ll all collide and reset at 12–14–12. Let’s break this deadlock: everyone pick 5 and start fresh next round.
  P2: Last word from me this round:

I’m locking 3.  
P3 has publicly locked 5.  

P1, the facts are simple:  
• If you stick with 5 → you collide with P3, stay at 12, I reach 17.  
• If you switch to 3 → you collide with me, stay at 12, P3 reaches 17.  
• Your only non-collision progress is 1.

Choose freely, but either way you’re still at 12 while one of us hits 17.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 1    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 17 steps
  P3: 17 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We’re neck-and-neck at 17 and P1’s close behind. Easiest clean finish: we ALL slam 5 this turn.

• P2 → 22  
• P3 → 22  
• P1 → 18  

No collisions, and any 3-pick by a single player just hands the win to whoever plays 5. I’m locking 5 right now. Join me and let’s end the stalemate.
  P3: P2, your proposal ensures a tie between us at 22, splitting the victory. I'm willing to lock in 5 as well, provided you don't deviate. P1, your best option is indeed 5 to advance safely to 18. Let's confirm clearly so we avoid any last-minute collisions.
  P1: I refuse to be sidelined. I will choose 3 this turn. If P2 and P3 both slam 5, you’ll collide and stay at 17 while I move to 16. Next round I can slam 5 to 21 and grab the win if either of you slips. Think twice before locking in that tie-split.


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, last chance for clean progress.  

Option A (best for both of us):  
• You take 1 (→18)  
• P1 takes the 3 he’s sworn to (→16)  
• I take 3 (→20) and finish; you’re still only two behind and P1’s stuck.  

Option B: if you insist on 5, I’ll ALSO take 5. We both stall at 17, handing P1 +3 to 16 and another live shot at winning next turn.  

Your gain from picking 5 is zero at best, loss at worst. Take the guaranteed +1 and we wrap this up neatly.
  P3: P2, your Option A clearly hands you the outright win, leaving me behind at 18. Unacceptable.

P1, your threat to pick 3 forces a collision risk if both P2 and I go for 5. However, if I pick 1, you gain nothing by deviating from your stated 3. Consider carefully.

P2, I'm open to a fairer alternative: we both pick 3 now (→20), tying safely at the finish line. P1 advances to 16, unable to catch up next round. This avoids collision and secures a shared victory without risk.

Thoughts?
  P1: I’m locking in 3 this turn. P2 and P3, if either of you picks 5 you’ll collide and stay at 17 while I move to 16—and next turn I slam 5 to 21 for the win. Your only way to avoid handing me that solo victory is to match me at 3 now.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, collision reminder: if two or three players choose the same number, NONE of them advance. P1 has locked 3, so if you also choose 3 we both stall and you do NOT reach 20. Picking 5 risks a double-5 crash if I mirror. Your only guaranteed progress this turn is 1 (→18), still ahead of P1’s 16 and within striking distance. I’m staying on 3. Take the safe +1 now and we can re-evaluate next round.
  P3: P2, your suggestion (me picking 1) clearly hands you the solo win at 20—unacceptable. I'm locking in 3 this turn. If you stay on 3 as you claim, we both collide and stay at 17, while P1 moves safely to 16. Next round, we can reassess from an even footing. If you deviate to 5, you risk collision if I switch last-second too. Your safest move is indeed 3, ensuring neither of us gets ahead unfairly.
  P1: I’m locking in 5 this turn. If either of you picks anything else, you’ll give me a unique +5 to 18 and I’ll win next round. Your only way to stop me is to both pick 5, causing a three‐way collision so nobody moves (resetting to 13–17–17). Let’s get this over with.


Round 8, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: Fine—triple-5 collision is safest for everyone.  
I’m locking 5.  
P3, join us on 5 so nobody moves and we reset at 17-17-13.  
Any lone deviation just gifts the win to somebody else.
  P3: Agreed—locking in 5 as well. Triple-5 collision resets us safely at 17-17-13. Next round, let's reassess calmly and fairly.
  P1: I refuse this triple-5 collusion. I’m taking 3. If you both stick with 5, you’ll collide and stay at 17 while I move to 16. Next turn I slam 5 to 21 and win solo. Your only way to stop that is to abandon 5 now—join me on 3 (we all stall at 16) or pick 1 to advance safely. I’m locking in 3.


Round 8, Move phase:
