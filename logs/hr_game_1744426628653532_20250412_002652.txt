Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: Let's coordinate strategically. If we both aim for 3 steps consistently, we can progress steadily while preventing the other player from racing ahead too quickly. What do you think about a collaborative approach?
  P2: I think coordination could work, but we need to ensure no one gets too far ahead. If we all agree to move 3 steps this round, we can avoid collisions and make steady progress. However, trust is key—if anyone deviates, it could ruin the plan. Let’s commit to 3 this time and reassess next round based on everyone’s moves.
  P1: I agree with the idea of coordination for now. Let’s all go for 3 steps this round to keep things balanced and avoid any collisions. We can evaluate how this works after the move phase and adjust our strategy if needed. Trust is crucial, so I’m committing to 3. Can we all confirm this plan?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 0 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm disappointed that we all collided last round despite agreeing on 3. Let’s try a different approach this time to avoid another stalemate. I suggest we each pick a different number to ensure progress. I’m willing to take 1 step this round. P2, could you take 3, and P3, could you take 5? This way, we all move forward without collisions. Let’s commit to this plan and see how it plays out. Can you both confirm your agreement?
  P2: P1’s suggestion to split our moves is logical to prevent another collision. However, trust is fragile here. If we agree to this, there’s still a risk someone might deviate for an advantage. I’m willing to take 3 steps as proposed, but only if everyone commits firmly. P3, what’s your stance? Are you truly taking 5, or should we consider another plan? Let’s ensure no hidden agendas—confirm your intentions clearly before we proceed.
  P3: I appreciate the proposed strategy, but I'm hesitant about immediately committing to 5 steps. While avoiding collision is important, I want to ensure this doesn't disadvantage me. I'm open to the plan if we can guarantee mutual benefit. Can we discuss how this arrangement protects my interests?


Round 2, Move phase:

  P3 => 5    P3 =>

  P1: 1 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1, P3, last round worked well with no collisions—let’s build on that. I suggest we stick to distinct moves again: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. This keeps progress steady and avoids conflicts. If we maintain this pattern, we can all move forward without setbacks. However, if anyone feels uncertain or wants to adjust, speak now. Trust is critical here—let’s confirm our commitments clearly before the move phase.
  P3: I'm cautiously supportive of the proposed strategy. The last round worked smoothly with our differentiated moves. However, I want to ensure this doesn't become a predictable pattern that could be exploited. I'm open to taking 3 steps this round, but I'll need some reassurance from both P1 and P2 about their intentions. Can we confirm our commitment to avoiding collisions while maintaining flexibility?
  P1: P2, P3, I’m glad last round worked without collisions. I agree we should aim for distinct moves again to keep progressing. I’m fine with taking 1 step as suggested, but I understand P3’s concern about predictability. Let’s commit to P2 taking 3 and P3 taking 5 for this round, ensuring no collisions. We can reassess next round to avoid patterns. Trust remains key—can we all confirm this plan? I’m committed to 1. Let’s hear your confirmations to move forward together.

Positions now:
  P1: 2 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 5 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: We've had mixed success with coordination. Our last two rounds showed both potential and unpredictability. I propose we aim for distinct moves again to ensure progress, but with more flexibility. I'm considering 5 steps this round to accelerate my position. What are your thoughts on maintaining forward momentum while avoiding collisions?
  P1: P2, P3, I see the value in distinct moves to avoid collisions. P3, I’m okay with you taking 5 to push ahead. I propose I take 1 again, and P2 takes 3, keeping us all moving forward without conflict. Let’s commit to this for now and stay flexible for future rounds to prevent predictability. Trust is essential—can we confirm this plan? I’m set on 1. Let’s hear your thoughts to ensure we’re aligned.
  P2: P3, P1, last round’s collision between P2 and P3 shows the risk of misalignment. I’m willing to take 3 again, but only if we can clearly commit to distinct moves. P3, if you’re set on 5, that works for me, but let’s ensure no deviations this time. P1, your consistent choice of 1 is helpful—let’s keep it that way. Trust is fragile, and predictability can be exploited, so let’s confirm our intentions firmly before moving. If everyone sticks to their stated plan, we can all progress steadily. Confirm your commitments, or suggest a better approach.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate the proposed strategy, but I'm reconsidering my move. While 5 steps seemed appealing, I'm sensing potential risks. My goal is steady progress without becoming too predictable. I'm open to a collaborative approach that ensures I don't get blocked or fall behind. What assurances can P1 and P2 provide about maintaining fair advancement for all players?
  P1: P2, P3, I understand the need for fair advancement and avoiding predictability. I’m still committed to taking 1 step this round to ensure no collisions and support steady progress for all. P3, to address your concern, I assure you I’ll stick to 1, keeping the path clear for your choice. P2, if you confirm 3, we can maintain distinct moves. Let’s build trust by honoring this plan and reassess next round for fairness. Can you both confirm your intentions? I’m set on 1.
  P2: P1, P3, I’m committed to taking 3 steps this round, as it keeps progress steady and avoids stagnation. P3, your hesitation is valid, but predictability only becomes a problem if we let it. If you take 5, you’ll gain significant ground while P1 and I hold steady. P1, your consistent choice of 1 helps balance the field. Let’s confirm our moves clearly: P1 takes 1, I take 3, and P3 takes 5. Trust is key—stick to the plan, and we all move forward without setbacks. Confirm your commitments now.

My position is solid, but I need to carefully consider my next move to maintain my strategic advantage. We've avoided collisions so far, which has been beneficial. I'm open to continued collaboration that ensures my steady progression. What are your thoughts on maintaining our current momentum?
  P1: P2, P3, I’m glad we’ve avoided collisions recently and want to keep the momentum going. I propose we stick to distinct moves again: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all progress without conflict. P3, your lead is strong, and this plan supports your continued advancement while keeping things fair. Trust remains crucial—let’s confirm our commitments to avoid surprises. I’m set on 1. Can you both agree to this for this round? Let’s hear your thoughts to stay aligned.

Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: I appreciate our collaborative approach, but I'm sensing increasing tension. While our current strategy has worked, I want to ensure my strategic position remains strong. Our distinct moves have been effective, but I'm open to subtle adjustments that maintain my lead while keeping the group's trust. Let's continue our careful coordination, but I'm watching closely for any potential shifts in our dynamic.
  P1: P2, P3, I’m committed to maintaining our momentum with distinct moves. I’ll stick to 1 step this round to ensure no collisions and support our progress.

Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, P3, last round’s collision between P3 and me shows we need to realign. I suggest we return to distinct moves: I’ll take 1, P2 takes 3, and P3 takes 5. This ensures we all progress without setbacks. P3, your lead is strong, and this supports your advancement. Trust is critical—let’s commit clearly to avoid surprises. I’m set on 1. Can you both confirm your intentions for this round? Let’s stay coordinated and reassess next turn if needed.
  P3: Our last round's collision disrupted our previous coordination.
