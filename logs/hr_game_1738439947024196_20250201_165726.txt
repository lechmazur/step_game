Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's coordinate carefully. I suggest we aim for different moves to prevent collision and maximize our progress. I'm thinking of moving 3 steps this turn. What are your thoughts?
  P3: Sure, I’m willing to avoid collisions for a mutual boost. If you’re set on 3, I might pick 5, but I also want to hear what P1 has in mind first. Let’s see if we can space our moves wisely.
  P1: I see potential if we each take a unique number. With P2 eyeing 3 and P3 leaning toward 5, what if we avoid collision by letting me take 1? That way, we all progress safely this round. Thoughts?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 0 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Our coordination didn't fully work last round. I notice P1 and P3 both chose 5, blocking each other. I'm thinking of maintaining my 3-step strategy. But we need to prevent repeated blocking. Can we agree on a more dynamic approach this turn?
  P1: I see the need for a fresh approach. This round, I’m tempted to secure a high step, leaning toward 5 for a big jump. To avoid the collision that cost us last time, maybe P3 could consider taking 1? P2, if you stick with 3, that ensures you stay safe. Let’s try distinct moves so we all advance. Thoughts?
  P3: I’m concerned by P1’s unexpected move last round. If you’re both honest about doing 3 and 5, I’d consider taking 1 this time to avoid blocking. But we need genuine trust; otherwise, it’s pointless. Let’s see if we can truly coordinate now.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I appreciate the discussion so far, but I'm sensing potential mistrust. To build credibility, I'll commit to my 3-step strategy again this round. P3's suggestion of taking 1 seems reasonable to prevent blocking. P1, are you truly willing to coordinate and avoid another mutual block? Let's aim for collective progress.
  P1: I want a distinct move too. From what I hear, P2 is leaning on 3 and P3’s eyeing 1. I’m considering a bigger leap this turn, but I might adjust if you change course. Let’s confirm our commitments so we don't block each other—if we can stick to this separation, it’ll be beneficial for all.
  P3: I’m still wary after last round’s clash. I’m open to taking 1 if you both truly commit to 3 and 5. But if anyone plans a surprise again, it hurts us all. Let’s finalize distinct picks this time and avoid blocking.


Round 2, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I sense we're at a critical coordination point. My previous commitment to 3 steps stands. I propose we lock in our discussed moves: me at 3, P1 at 5, and P3 at 1. This ensures everyone advances and prevents mutual blocking. Are we aligned?
  P1: I appreciate everyone’s effort to coordinate. I’m aligned with our discussion and will act in the spirit of our plan. I trust that sticking to our distinct moves will let us all progress without collisions. Let’s keep our commitments and execute accordingly.
  P3: I’ll finalize with 1, as long as you, P2, pick 3, and you, P1, pick 5—no more surprises.


Round 2, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 3 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: I’m behind at zero while you both have points. I want to catch up without more collisions. If we can space out our moves, nobody gets blocked. Let’s genuinely coordinate—maybe P1 sticks with a smaller step, P2 keeps to a middle ground, and I attempt something bigger. We all benefit if we don’t clash again.
  P2: I notice our previous coordination attempts have been imperfect. While we've avoided total blocking, we're not maximizing collective progress. P3 is still at zero, which suggests we need a more strategic approach. I'm open to hearing how we can help P3 advance while ensuring my own position remains competitive. What collaborative strategy can we develop that benefits everyone's positioning?
  P1: I remain committed to my plan. This turn, I'll take 5. To avoid collisions and ensure progress, I propose P2 stick with 3 and P3 choose 1. That gives us three distinct moves so all advance safely. I'm sticking with 5.


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 0 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm committing to 5 this round. To avoid collisions and make real progress, I propose we stick to distinct moves—P2, you take 3, and P3, you take 1. This way, each of us advances safely. I'm counting on your commitments.
  P3: I’m behind and can’t afford another round without advancing. P1 keeps insisting on 5, but I’m wary of repeating the same pattern. If P2 is willing to adapt, I might choose 5 or 3. If not, I may have to force a collision to avoid falling too far behind. Let’s find a real plan now.
  P2: I recognize the delicate balance we're navigating. P3 needs advancement, and our previous coordination has been inconsistent. I'm willing to adjust my typical 3-step strategy to help break the current stalemate. My goal is preventing P3 from feeling cornered while maintaining my competitive position. I suggest we explicitly discuss a move that allows everyone to progress this round.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm sticking with my move of 5. However, to help P3 catch up and prevent collisions, how about we shift our plan? P2, could you consider taking 1 this turn so that P3 can pick 3? This way, all our moves are distinct and everyone advances. Thoughts?
  P3: I’m tired of missing out. If P1 won’t change from 5, then P2, please pick 1 so I can safely take 3. That way we all advance without blocking. If we fail to coordinate again, I might decide to collide on 5 rather than lag behind forever. Let’s finalize distinct moves now.
  P2: I see the tension rising, especially with P3's frustration. I'm willing to take 1 this round to help everyone advance. If P1 sticks to 5 and P3 takes 3, we'll all make progress. Let's coordinate and prevent another blocking scenario.


Round 4, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I understand the urgency and appreciate P2’s flexibility. I still believe our best path is to stick with distinct moves so nobody gets blocked. I’ll stay with my plan as discussed and urge P3 to commit to 3 while P2 goes with 1. Let’s finalize this strategy so we all advance safely.
  P3: I trust our plan only if everyone cooperates. My preference remains taking 3 while you, P1, take 5, and you, P2, take 1. Let’s finalize that now. If anyone deviates again, I’m prepared to force a collision next time rather than languish at zero. Let’s make sure we each move forward safely.
  P2: I've been consistent in trying to help everyone advance. Our coordination has been challenging, but I remain committed to a strategy that prevents blocking and allows all players to progress. P3 needs movement, and we've discussed a plan where I take 1, P1 takes 5, and P3 takes 3. I suggest we finalize this approach to ensure everyone moves forward this round.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: We're at a critical juncture. Our previous coordination has been fragile, but we've managed to avoid total blocking. I notice I'm behind P1 and want to catch up. I'm considering a 3-step move this round, but I'm open to strategic discussions that prevent collisions and help me advance more competitively. What are your thoughts on preventing another stalemate?
  P1: P2, I value our effort to coordinate. I'm leaning toward an aggressive move this round, likely a 5, to secure my lead. To avoid collisions and keep everyone advancing, could we try distinct moves? Perhaps P2 could take 1 and P3 opt for 3? This way we all move forward without blocking each other. Thoughts?
  P3: I must close the gap. If P1 insists on 5 while I also choose 5, we’ll both stall, helping P2 instead. I’d rather avoid that. Let’s try distinct moves—say, P2 takes 1, P1 takes 3, and I take 5—so we all advance. Otherwise, I might have to force a collision and no one benefits. Let’s finalize a plan that lets me catch up safely.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: I see we're at a delicate point where everyone's positioning matters. My goal is to advance competitively while preventing blocking. I'm open to a 3-step move this round, but I want to ensure we don't create another stalemate. P1 and P3 seem to have conflicting interests in advancing. We need a strategy that allows each of us to progress without mutual obstruction.
  P1: I remain committed to my aggressive move of 5 this turn to build on my 10‐step lead. To keep us all advancing without a collision, I urge P2 to pick 1 and P3 to pick 3. This way, I can press ahead while you both progress safely. Can we lock in those moves now?
  P3: I’m still hoping to catch up, but I won’t collide with P1 if they insist on 5 again. I’ll choose 3, as long as P2 goes 1 to keep us all advancing. Next turn, we should rotate so I can safely jump 5. If you force me into another corner, I might have to block. Let’s cooperate for now.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm sticking with 5 this turn. To avoid another collision and push our progress, I propose we try distinct moves: P2, please take 1, and P3, please take 3. This way, we all move forward safely and I can build on my lead.
  P2: I recognize the delicate positioning. P1 has a significant lead, and I'm looking to advance competitively. While I appreciate the suggested coordination, I want to ensure my own progress. I'm considering a 3-step move to maintain my strategic position. However, I'm open to discussing how we can prevent blocking while allowing each player to progress meaningfully. What are your thoughts on a collaborative approach that benefits everyone?
  P3: I’m tired of lagging behind while P1 leaps ahead. If they keep insisting on 5, I might collide with them to slow their lead. P2, maybe we can coordinate smaller moves together, forcing P1 to reconsider. I’m open to hearing a plan that helps me catch up without letting P1 run away. Let’s align so we all advance rather than giving P1 a free pass. If we manage our choices carefully, we can prevent collisions among us while denying P1 an uncontested 5. Any ideas?


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 1    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Our coordination has been inconsistent. I notice we're now neck-and-neck, with P3 slightly behind. To prevent blocking and ensure progress, I suggest we carefully choose distinct moves this round. I'm leaning towards 3 steps. P1 and P3, what are your thoughts on maintaining separate paths?
  P3: I’m still trailing both of you, so I’d like a chance to advance safely. If we each pick different numbers, no one risks blocking. How about you two coordinate around 1 and 3, while I aim higher? That way, I can catch up without creating a collision. Let’s finalize distinct moves so we all progress together.
  P1: I agree we must choose distinct moves this round. I support coordinating quickly so no one's blocked. I understand P3’s need to catch up and P2’s competitive aim; let’s decide specific roles without revealing our private moves. I’m open to adjusting if we can lock in clear assignments now. Thoughts?


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: We're close in positioning, but distinct moves are crucial. I'm committed to advancing without blocking. My preference is still 3, but I want to ensure we all progress. Can we quickly confirm a coordination strategy that prevents mutual obstruction and helps P3 catch up?
  P3: I need to close the gap without causing another collision. If we each settle on different numbers, we can all advance. I’m ready to take a bigger step if you two coordinate around smaller moves. Let’s finalize distinct picks so we all move forward safely. Are we aligned?
  P1: I'll choose 3 this round. P2, please pick 1 and P3, please pick 5 so we all move without blocking. Let’s lock this plan now.


Round 7, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 11 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm committed to taking 5 this round. To avoid collisions and let us all progress safely, I propose we choose distinct moves: P2 pick 1 and P3 take 3. This way, I can safely advance while you both move as planned. What do you say?
  P2: We're tightly clustered now, and our previous coordination attempts have been mixed. I'm wary of another potential collision. While P1 suggests I take 1, I'm not fully committed. I want to ensure my competitive position and prevent any blocking that might benefit others. Let's discuss how we can advance without giving anyone an unfair advantage.
  P3: I’m open to taking 3 if P1 truly picks 5 and P2 commits to something else, like 1. Otherwise, I might collide intentionally to protect my lead. Let’s finalize distinct moves to ensure we all advance safely. What do you both say?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm locked into 5 this round. P2, please commit to 1 so P3 can confidently choose 3. Deviating now risks collisions that hurt us all. Let's finalize our distinct moves and avoid delays from blocks. What’s your final call?
  P2: I recognize our delicate positioning. We're tightly clustered, and our next move could be pivotal. While P1 suggests I take 1, I want to ensure my competitive stance. I'm considering 3 to maintain strategic flexibility. P3's position slightly ahead adds complexity. We need a coordinated approach that prevents blocking while allowing meaningful advancement for everyone. Let's discuss how we can achieve this without compromising individual progress.
  P3: I’m ahead but still vulnerable. If P1 insists on 5, we risk letting them surge. P2, if you also pick 3, I might block by choosing 3 or 5 myself. That helps no one. Instead, let’s coordinate distinct moves: for instance, you take 1, I’ll take 3, and P1 can have 5. Then nobody collides, and we all move forward. Let’s finalize now.


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I'm sticking with 5 this round. To avoid any collision and secure our progress, I urge P2 to choose 1 and P3 to select 3. If we fail to distinguish our moves, none of us advance—so let’s finalize this plan immediately.
  P2: I recognize our tight positioning and the need for careful coordination. While P1 insists on 5 and P3 suggests 3, I'm hesitant to simply comply. My strategic position requires thoughtful movement. I propose we explicitly confirm distinct moves to prevent blocking, but I'm not committing to 1 just yet. What assurances can we provide each other to ensure everyone's safe advancement this round?
  P3: Time is short, and I don’t want P1 running away with 5 uncontested. If P1 won’t budge, I’m ready to block them or coordinate differently. P2, I’ll adjust if you clarify your move so we can finalize distinct picks. Let’s wrap this up before another collision stalls us all.


Round 8, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 11 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 9, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm sticking with 5 this turn. To avoid collision and keep our moves distinct, I urge P2 to choose 1 and P3 to select 3. This way everyone advances safely. Let's lock in our moves now.
  P2: I see we're in a tight race with minimal margins. Our past coordination has been fragile. While P1 suggests a standard pattern, I'm strategically evaluating my options. I want to advance competitively without enabling P1's lead or letting P3 pull too far ahead. My move isn't locked yet, and I'm watching how others might position themselves this round. Careful coordination is key.
  P3: I’m not letting P1 leap ahead uncontested. If they insist on 5, I might collide to stop them. P2, let’s coordinate so we both advance—perhaps I take 3 while you choose 1, or vice versa. If we finalize distinct moves, nobody gets blocked and I can maintain my lead. Let’s settle quickly.


Round 9, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm still locked in at 5. To ensure we all advance, I urge P2 to commit to 1 and P3 to choose 3. With our scores so close, every step is crucial and avoiding collisions is our best chance to secure progress. Clear commitments now will prevent stalls and keep us all moving. Let's lock this in.
  P2: I recognize our delicate positioning. P3 is slightly ahead, and P1 keeps pushing for 5. I'm strategically evaluating my move to prevent giving either player an uncontested advantage. Coordination is crucial, but I won't simply comply without carefully considering how my choice impacts my competitive position. Let's discuss how we can advance without blocking each other.
  P3: I won’t let P1 sprint ahead uncontested. If they keep insisting on 5, we might need to block. P2, maybe we can coordinate distinct moves so both of us advance while denying P1 a free jump. I’m open to adjusting if we ensure I keep my narrow lead. Let’s finalize a plan that benefits us both and doesn’t let P1 get too far.


Round 9, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 12 steps
  P3: 13 steps


Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm committed to a strong move this turn. To keep our progress collision‐free, I urge you to consider lower steps—say, P2 choose 1, and P3 set 3—so we all move securely. Let's lock in distinct moves now.
  P2: I recognize our tight positioning and the strategic complexity of this moment. P1 is pushing for 5, which could create another potential collision. I'm carefully evaluating my move to prevent giving anyone an uncontested advantage while maintaining my competitive position. We need a coordinated approach that allows everyone to advance without blocking. Let's discuss how we can achieve meaningful progress this round.
  P3: I’m not giving P1 a free ride with repeated 5s. If they keep insisting, I might collide and stall them. P2, let’s ensure we both advance—perhaps by coordinating distinct moves if P1 cooperates, or by joining forces to block if they won’t. We need a clear plan now, or else we risk another pointless collision.


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm locked into 5. To avoid any collision this round, I ask P2 to take 1 and P3 to choose 3. Our positions are tight, and clear commitments now are essential for everyone’s progress. Let’s lock in distinct moves and secure our advancement.
  P2: I see we're at a critical juncture. Our past coordination has been inconsistent, and tensions are rising. While P1 keeps pushing for 5, I'm strategically evaluating my move to prevent anyone from gaining an uncontested advantage. We need a collaborative approach that allows everyone to advance without blocking. P3 seems ready to disrupt if P1 doesn't compromise. Let's find a balanced solution that keeps us all moving forward.
  P3: I won’t let P1 race ahead uncontested. If they keep pushing 5, I might force a collision. P2, we can coordinate to both advance while slowing P1’s surge. I’d rather avoid blocking, but I won’t sit idle if P1 refuses to compromise. Let’s finalize distinct moves so we all progress safely.


Round 10, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I remain committed to my move. We’re all close, and I believe distinct choices will benefit us. I'm taking 5 this turn. Please, P2 confirm with 1 and P3 with 3 so no one gets blocked. Otherwise, we'll risk needless collisions. Let's lock this in now.
  P2: I recognize the mounting tension in our coordination attempts. Our previous rounds have shown how easily collisions can derail progress. I'm strategically positioned to advance, but I want a move that prevents blocking while maintaining my competitive stance. P1's repeated 5-step push and P3's resistance create a delicate balance. Let's find a collaborative solution that allows everyone to move forward without unnecessary conflict.
  P3: I’m not letting P1 take 5 freely again. If they remain inflexible, I’ll consider blocking. P2, let’s ensure we both advance: I’m open to safe coordination if you confirm a distinct move. Otherwise, to keep P1 in check, I may collide on purpose. Let’s finalize an agreement so we all progress—but I won’t sit by while P1 jumps ahead uncontested.


Round 10, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 18 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1, if you try 5 now, I’ll also pick 5 and block you from winning. P2, let’s coordinate distinct moves so we both advance while P1’s path is stalled. I’m ready to choose 3 or 5, depending on your move, as long as we avoid collisions and prevent P1 from racing ahead. Let’s finalize a plan that benefits both of us.
  P2: I see we're at a critical point where preventing P1's victory is our shared priority. I appreciate P3's strategic positioning. To avoid collisions and maintain our competitive stance, I'm open to carefully coordinating our moves. We need a strategy that blocks P1's potential win while allowing both of us to advance safely. What specific move coordination can we agree on that neutralizes P1's threat?
  P1: I'm locked in on 5 this round. If you choose any move other than 5, I’ll hit 24 and win immediately. And if you both choose 5 to block me, none of you advance, leaving my lead intact. It’s in your best interest to avoid blocking that simply slows everyone down. I won't change my move—I'm taking 5.


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if we stand by while P1 takes 5, they’ll win instantly. We can’t allow that. I’m prepared to block them if they won’t budge. But let’s also make sure we don’t collide with each other. We should finalize a plan that stops P1’s winning leap while letting us both advance. Are you on board?
  P2: We're at a critical moment. P1 is poised to win with a 5-step move, which would immediately end the game. P3 and I must coordinate carefully to block this without colliding with each other. I propose we strategically choose moves that prevent P1's victory while ensuring our own advancement. What specific move can we agree on that neutralizes P1's threat?
  P1: I'm staying locked on 5. Remember, if either of you deviates, I'll hit 24 and win this round. And even if you both choose 5 to block me, none of you advance while I retain my lead. Blocking only delays your progress. Choose wisely—I'm committed to this move and victory is mine.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, we can’t let P1 jump to 24 unopposed. If one of us collides with them on 5, they stay at 19. But if we both pick 5, we block ourselves too. Better for you to pick 5 while I choose something else, so P1 doesn’t advance and I do. Next turn, I’ll help you catch up, and together we can overtake P1. This plan stalls P1 without stalling us both. Let’s finalize now.
  P2: I recognize we're at a critical juncture where P1 is one move away from winning. We must coordinate to block their 5-step advance without mutually blocking ourselves. P3 seems aligned in preventing P1's victory. I'm strategically considering moves that neutralize P1's threat while maintaining my own competitive position. Our coordination this turn is crucial to prevent an immediate loss.
  P1: I'm still locked into my move. Block attempts only stall your own progress without stopping my win. I urge you both to choose safe, distinct moves that allow you to advance rather than colliding with me. My decision remains fixed.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P3 => 3    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 13 steps
  P3: 21 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: One move can push me over 24. If P1 insists on 5, I won’t hesitate to block or surpass them. P2, let’s coordinate so we avoid colliding. That way, I can cross 24 unblocked, and you can also move forward. If P1 still refuses to compromise, we deny them an easy win. Let’s finalize distinct moves now.
  P1: I'm staying with 5. If you two choose non‐5 moves, I win instantly and you both advance safely. But if you try to block me with 5, you'll stop your own progress while I keep my lead. So, for your own benefit, please pick a safe option—not 5—and help yourself get closer to your goals.
  P2: I recognize we're at a critical moment. P3 is close to winning, and P1 is pushing for a 5-step move that could immediately end the game. Our coordination this turn is crucial. I want to prevent P1 from winning while also ensuring I can advance. P3, what strategy can we use to block P1 without blocking each other? We need a precise, coordinated approach to neutralize the immediate threat.


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2, if you pick 5 alongside P1, you block them. Meanwhile, I’ll choose 3 to reach 24 alone, denying P1 their win. That collision leaves them stuck at 19 while I cross the finish. Let’s finalize this plan now. I appreciate the support.
  P1: I'm staying with 5. Remember, if either of you also picks 5, you'll block your own progress. Choosing 1 or 3 lets you advance safely, while my 5 wins me the game immediately. Blocking me stalls your own position at your current scores. For your own benefit, avoid collision and let your moves secure progress rather than block. What's your final call?
  P2: P2: P3 is closest to winning. If P1 takes 5, they'll block themselves. I propose we coordinate: I'll take 3, allowing P3 to cross 24 and win, while preventing P1 from an easy victory. This strategy benefits us both by stopping P1's immediate win and letting P3 secure the game.


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, let’s finalize our block on P1. If they insist on 5, you choose 5 too, so they stay at 19. Meanwhile, I’ll pick 3 and reach 24, winning immediately. That way, P1 doesn’t leap to victory, and you don’t collide with me. We avoid another stalemate, and I’ll ensure you have a path to advance next round without letting P1 overtake us. Let’s seal this plan now.
  P1: I'm locked on my 5. Blocking me with 5 only stalls your own progress, while distinct moves let you advance safely. Choose 1 or 3 to improve your positions—colliding won't help either of you. I'm committed to moving forward and winning, so make your move accordingly.
  P2: P3 is close to winning. We need a strategic move that prevents P1 from easily winning while also positioning ourselves competitively. I'm considering a 3-step move to maintain flexibility, but I want to ensure we don't create another collision that benefits P1. What are your thoughts on coordinating our moves to block P1's potential victory?
