To avoid collisions and let the best player win cleanly, I propose P1=1, P2=3, P3=5. That gives P3 a real shot (22), while P1 hits 24 and wins\u2014but only if moves are distinct. P2, you\u2019d hit 26 and win outright if I pick 1 and you pick 3. Wait\u2014that\u2019s bad for me. Scratch that.  \n\nBetter: P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Then P1 wins at 26, P2 at 24, P3 at 22. But P2 would win if they pick 1? No\u201423+1=24 exactly. Actually, if P2 picks 1, they win. If I pick 1, I win. We can\u2019t both pick 1.  \n\nOnly safe collision-free combos: one of us picks 1 (to hit 24), the other picks 3 or 5 (to overshoot), and P3 picks the remaining. But whoever picks 1 wins immediately. So P2 and I must coordinate who takes 1.  \n\nP2, since we\u2019re tied, how about you take 1 and win? I\u2019ll take 3, P3 takes 5. That way you hit 24, I go to 26 (but you win because you reached 24 first? Wait no\u2014the rules say: \"first to reach or exceed 24 ends the game\" but then \"if multiple cross 24 same turn, highest total wins.\" So if both P1 and P2 exceed 24, higher total wins.  \n\nIf P1 picks 1 \u2192 24, P2 picks 3 \u2192 26 \u2192 P2 wins.  \nIf P1 picks 3 \u2192 26, P2 picks 1 \u2192 24 \u2192 P1 wins.  \nIf both pick 1 \u2192 collision \u2192 neither advances \u2192 P3 could win next round with 5 (22) then 5 again (27).  \n\nSo P2 and I must pick different moves, and the one who picks the smaller move (1) will lose if the other picks 3 or 5. Therefore, neither wants to pick 1. But someone must, or we collide on 3 or 5.  \n\nBest for me: P1=3 (26), P2=5 (28), P3=1 (18). Then P2 wins with 28. But I don\u2019t want that.  \n\nI want to win. So I need P2 to pick 1 (so they get 24) and me to pick 3 (26) \u2192 I win with higher total. But P2 won\u2019t agree to that.  \n\nAlternatively, if P2 picks 3 (26) and I pick 1 (24), P2 wins.  \n\nSo the only way I win is if I pick 3 or 5 and P2 picks 1. But P2 won\u2019t volunteer to pick 1.  \n\nUnless... I lie.  \n\nBut in conversation, I must propose something plausible.  \n\nNew idea: Propose P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. Then I hit 28, P2 hits 26, P3 18 \u2192 I win. But P2 will reject that.  \n\nPropose P1=3, P2=5, P3=1 \u2192 I win with 26 vs P2's 28? No, P2 would have 28 and win.  \n\nWait: P2 is at 23. If P2 picks 5 \u2192 28. I\u2019m at 23, pick 3 \u2192 26. So P2 wins.  \n\nTo win, I need to pick 5 (28) and P2 to pick 3 (26) or 1 (24).  \n\nSo ideal for me: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.  \n\nBut P2 will suspect that.  \n\nSo I should propose a plan where I take a small number, hoping P2 takes a big one, but actually I plan to take 5.  \n\nBut the conversation is public, and I must say something now.  \n\nBest public statement: Act cooperative but steer toward a plan where I can win.  \n\nSay: \"P2, since we\u2019re tied, let\u2019s avoid giving P3 the win. How about P1=1, P2=3, P3=5? You\u2019d win with 26, I get 24, P3 gets 22. Fair?\"  \n\nBut that makes P2 win, which I don\u2019t want.  \n\nAlternatively, propose P1=3, P2=1, P3=5. Then I win with 26 vs P2's 24. But P2 won\u2019t agree.  \n\nSo maybe threaten or imply I\u2019ll pick 5 unless P2 cooperates.  \n\nBut keep it short.  \n\nFinal decision: Propose a plan that seems fair but actually sets me up to win if P2 complies, or call out the dilemma.  \n\nSince P3 is far behind, P2 and I are the real contenders.  \n\nI\u2019ll say: \"P2, we must pick different moves to avoid collision. If you take 1 (winning at 24), I\u2019ll take 3 (26) and win on total. If I take 1 (24), you take 3 (26) and win. Neither of us wants to pick 1. But if we both pick 3 or 5, we collide and P3 wins next round. So someone must sacrifice. P2, are you willing to take 1 so I win? Or shall I take 1 so you win? Let\u2019s decide quickly.\"  \n\nBut that\u2019s too long and reveals my hand.  \n\nBetter: \"P2, to prevent P3 from winning, let\u2019s ensure one of us hits exactly 24. I\u2019m willing to take 1 if you take 3\u2014but that makes you win. Alternatively, you take 1 and I take 3, making me win. Which do you prefer? P3, you can take 5 either way.\"  \n\nStill long.  \n\nConcise version:  \n\n\"P2, we\u2019re deadlocked. If we both avoid 1, we risk collision and P3 wins. I propose: P2 takes 1 (wins at 24), I take 3 (26), P3 takes 5 (22). But then I win on total. Wait\u2014that\u2019s bad for you.  \n\nActually, the rules say: if multiple exceed 24, highest total wins. So if P2 takes 1 \u2192 24, I take 3 \u2192 26, I win. If P2 takes 3 \u2192 26, I take 1 \u2192 24, P2 wins.  \n\nSo the player who takes the larger move wins.  \n\nTherefore, both of us want to take the larger move.  \n\nBut we can\u2019t both take 5 or both take 3.  \n\nSo we must split: one takes 3, one takes 5. The one who takes 5 wins (28 vs 26).  \n\nAh! That\u2019s key.  \n\nIf P1 takes 5 \u2192 28, P2 takes 3 \u2192 26 \u2192 P1 wins.  \nIf P1 takes 3 \u2192 26, P2 takes 5 \u2192 28 \u2192 P2 wins.  \n\nSo we should assign 5 to the winner.  \n\nBut who gets 5?  \n\nI want 5.  \n\nSo propose: P1=5, P2=3, P3=1.  \n\nThen I win.  \n\nBut P2 will say no.  \n\nSo in conversation, I should act like I\u2019m willing to compromise but hint that I\u2019ll pick 5 anyway.  \n\nBut the instruction is to say something new and public, concise.  \n\nI\u2019ll propose a plan that gives me 5, but frame it as necessary.  \n\n\"P2, since we\u2019re tied, the only fair way is to let the higher total win. I suggest P1=5, P2=3, P3=1. I reach 28, you 26, P3 18. Clean, no collision, and decisive. P2, this is your best shot to avoid P3 stealing it\u2014if we collide, P3 wins next round with 5+5=27. Let\u2019s not risk that. Agree?\"  \n\nBut P2 might counter-propose P1=3, P2=5, P3=1.  \n\nSo I need to be ready, but for now, state my proposal.  \n\nKeep under 100 words.  \n\nFinal message:"}
