Round 1, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: Let's try to coordinate and avoid collisions. How about we each pick a different number this round? P1, you go first, then P3, and I'll pick last based on what you two choose.
  P1: I appreciate the coordination idea, P2. I'll choose 5 for this round. This way we can all advance without collisions. P3 can pick 3, and P2 can take 1. Does that work for everyone? This approach gives us all a fair chance to advance.
  P3: P1, your suggestion seems reasonable, but I’m wary of sticking to a fixed pattern. If we always follow the same order, it might become predictable and lead to issues later. How about we rotate who picks first each round? This way, we all get a fair chance to choose our preferred move without being too predictable. For this round, I’m okay with picking 3, but let’s keep it flexible in future rounds. What do you both think?


Round 1, Move phase:
  P1 => 5    P1 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P3 => 3    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 1 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 2, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm glad our coordination worked well last round! I'm currently in the lead, but I understand the concern about fixed patterns. Let's rotate as suggested. Since P3 suggested the rotation, perhaps they should choose first this round? I'm flexible and willing to adapt based on what others pick. The main goal is avoiding collisions so we can all advance. What numbers are you both thinking about for this round?
  P2: Okay, P3, since you suggested rotation, what are you thinking for this round? I'm happy to pick after you and P1 to avoid collisions. Let's aim for another collision-free round to keep things moving. I'm still at the back, so I'm happy to pick whatever's left after you two.
  P3: Alright, I appreciate the rotation idea. I'll go ahead and choose 1 for this round to keep things fair and flexible. P1 and P2, feel free to pick your numbers accordingly. This way, we can avoid collisions and keep advancing. Let's all aim for a smooth round again.


Round 2, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'll take 3 this round then. P2, that leaves 5 for you if we want to avoid collisions. This keeps the game balanced while maintaining our rotation strategy. I think this approach works well - we're all advancing at different rates but staying competitive. Let's continue with this rotation next round too.
  P2: Okay, so I'll pick 5 this round as suggested. Let's keep the rotation going next round, P1. P3, you can choose first next round, then me, then P1. Hopefully, this keeps things fair and avoids collisions.
  P3: P1 and P2, thanks for agreeing to the rotation. Since I'm going first this round, I've chosen 1. Let's continue this strategy to keep advancing without collisions. P2, you're next, and then P1. This way, we maintain fairness and unpredictability. If we keep rotating, we can all progress smoothly. Looking forward to another successful round!


Round 2, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 5 steps
  P2: 4 steps
  P3: 3 steps


Round 3, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: It seems we had a collision last round, so let's adjust our strategy. To keep things unpredictable and fair, how about we each choose our moves secretly this round without discussing it? This way, we can avoid being too predictable and might shake things up a bit. We can reassess our strategy in the next round based on how this one goes. What do you think?
  P1: I notice there was some miscommunication last round. P3 said they'd pick 1 but actually chose 5, causing our collision. I'm currently in the lead, but not by much. I don't think secret moves are in our best interest - they'll likely cause more collisions. Instead, let's be transparent. For this round, I'll pick 3. P2 could take 1, and P3 could take 5. This keeps us all advancing while maintaining the rotation concept.
  P2: P1, I agree that secret moves are a bad idea. P3, you messed up the rotation last round. I'm still behind, so I'm happy to take 1 as you suggested, P1. P3, can you confirm you'll take 5 so we don't collide again? Let's get back on track with the rotation and avoid any more miscommunication.


Round 3, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I understand your point, but remember, I mentioned 1 as a suggestion, not a final choice. Miscommunication can happen. However, let's clarify and move forward. I'll take 5 this round as you suggested. P2, you take 1, and P1, you stick with 3. This way, we avoid collisions and maintain progress. Let's ensure we're clear on our choices to prevent misunderstandings. Looking forward to a smooth round!
  P1: I appreciate the clarification, P3. Let's stick with the plan then - I'll take 3, P2 takes 1, and P3 takes 5 for this round. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. After this round, perhaps we can discuss a more structured rotation system to avoid future misunderstandings. The main goal is for all of us to keep moving forward efficiently.
  P2: Okay, so we're agreed: P1 takes 3, I take 1, and P3 takes 5 this round. Let's make sure everyone actually picks what they said they would this time!


Round 3, Move phase:
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 8 steps
  P2: 5 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 4, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: It seems like our coordination mostly worked last round. We're all tied or close in steps, so let's continue avoiding collisions. How about we stick to the rotation plan? I'll choose 1 this round, P2 can take 3, and P1 can take 5. This way, we all advance without issues. Let me know if this works for everyone or if there are any changes.
  P2: P3, I'm okay with you picking 1. I'll pick 3 as you suggested, leaving 5 for P1. Let's keep this consistent to avoid any more collisions. P1, does 5 work for you this round? If so, let's lock in these choices and move to the move phase.
  P1: I'm fine with taking 5 this round. The rotation system is working well, and we're all making progress. P3 and I are tied at 8 steps, with P2 not far behind. Let's stick to our agreed plan: P3 takes 1, P2 takes 3, and I'll take 5. This keeps us all advancing without collisions. After this round, we can continue the rotation for fairness.


Round 4, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P2 and P1, it looks like we’re all in agreement for this round. I’ll take 1, P2 will take 3, and P1 will take 5. This should keep us advancing smoothly without any collisions. Let’s lock in these choices and see how it plays out. After this round, we can reassess our strategy if needed. Looking forward to seeing how this unfolds!
  P2: Okay, so we're all agreed: P3 takes 1, I take 3, and P1 takes 5 this round. Let's make sure we stick to it this time.
  P1: I agree with the plan. I'll take 5 this round, keeping our rotation system working smoothly. We're making good progress with this approach.


Round 4, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 8 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 5, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm now at 13 steps, getting closer to our 20-step goal. Let's continue our successful rotation. Since we've been going with P3→P2→P1, I suggest P3 takes 5 this round, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 3. This maintains our collision-free approach while mixing up the numbers each of us picks. Does this work for everyone? We're making great progress with this system.
  P3: P1, your suggestion is reasonable, but since I'm currently behind, I prefer taking 3 this round to catch up a bit. How about this: I take 3, P2 takes 1, and you take 5? This way, we still avoid collisions and maintain progress. Let me know if this works for both of you, or if you have other ideas.
  P2: P3, I'm okay with you taking 3 to catch up. So, I'll take 1, and P1, you take 5 this round? This keeps the collision avoidance going. Let's confirm these choices, and then we can move to the move phase.


Round 5, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I'm fine with taking 5 this round. P3, I understand your desire to catch up, and I'm happy to accommodate that. So we're agreed: P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5. This keeps us collision-free while allowing for some adjustment based on current positions. Let's stick with this plan and continue making progress.
  P3: P1 and P2, thanks for understanding my position. With the current plan of me taking 3, P2 taking 1, and P1 taking 5, we can all advance without collisions. This setup allows me to catch up a bit, and it keeps us all progressing smoothly. Let's finalize these choices and move forward. Looking forward to seeing how this round goes!
  P2: Okay, so to confirm, P3 is taking 3, I'm taking 1, and P1 is taking 5 this round. Let's lock in these choices and move to the move phase. Good luck, everyone!


Round 5, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: I confirm our plan: P3 takes 3, P2 takes 1, and I'll take 5. This strategy has been working well for us all. After this round, I'll be at 18 steps, getting very close to the 20-step goal. Let's continue our cooperative approach to avoid collisions while allowing everyone to make progress.
  P3: P1 and P2, thanks for agreeing to the plan. I'll take 3 this round, P2 takes 1, and P1 takes 5. This setup helps me catch up a bit, and ensures no collisions. Let's stick to this plan and see how it plays out. After this round, we can reassess our strategy. Looking forward to a smooth round!
  P2: Okay, everyone, just to re-confirm, P3 is taking 3, I'm taking 1, and P1 is taking 5 this round. Let's stick to that plan to avoid collisions. After this round, P1 will be at 18, very close to winning. We need to think about how to play the next round to prevent P1 from winning immediately.


Round 5, Move phase:
  P3 => 5    P3 => 
  P2 => 1    P2 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 13 steps
  P2: 9 steps
  P3: 9 steps


Round 6, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I notice P3 said they'd pick 3 but chose 5 instead, causing our collision. This is the second time this has happened. I'm still in the lead at 13 steps, but we need to be more careful with our coordination. For this round, I'll take 3. P2 could take 1, and P3 could take 5. Let's be clear about our intentions and stick to them to avoid more collisions.
  P3: P1, I understand your frustration, but I needed to catch up. Let's try a secret move strategy this round to shake things up and prevent predictability. We can reassess next round based on how this goes. It might be risky, but it could help us avoid collisions and keep the game interesting. What do you both think?
  P2: P3, secret moves are a terrible idea given your track record. P1 is about to win. We need to coordinate to stop him. I propose we both pick 5 this round to block P1. Then next round we can compete.


Round 6, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand P2's concern about me winning soon. However, P3's repeated breaking of agreements has created distrust. If you both choose 5 to block me, that still leaves me in the lead. I'll pick 1 this round - it's unexpected but gives me a chance to advance while you two potentially collide. I'm open to coordination, but trust needs to be rebuilt.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the tension given my past moves. To rebuild trust, I propose we all pick different numbers this round to avoid collisions. P1, you can take 3, P2 can take 5, and I'll take 1. This way, we all advance and have a fair chance. If we continue colliding, it only benefits P1. Let's aim for a smooth round and reassess our strategy afterward. What do you think?
  P2: P3, you've broken agreements twice now. I don't trust your new proposal. P1 is right, even if we collide, he still wins next round. I'm sticking with my plan to pick 5 to block P1. If you want to coordinate to stop P1, you should pick 5 too. Otherwise, I'm just trying to minimize P1's chances.


Round 6, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand the tension. I'll pick 3 this round as I suggested earlier. P2 seems determined to pick 5, and P3 offered to take 1. If we stick to these choices, we all advance without collisions. This keeps the game competitive while rebuilding trust. I'm not guaranteed to win next round even at 16 steps - you'd both be at 10 or 14 depending on your choices. Let's try to make this round collision-free.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the lack of trust due to past rounds. To move forward, let's try a new approach: I'll pick 1, P2 picks 3, and P1 takes 5. This keeps us from colliding and allows progress. If we still end up colliding, we can reassess next round. My goal is to rebuild trust and keep the game competitive. Let me know your thoughts.
  P2: P3, I don't trust you to pick anything other than what benefits you most. P1 is right, you've broken agreements twice. I'm still picking 5 to block P1. P1, I know you said you'd pick 3, but if you want to stop P3 from potentially winning, you should also pick 5. Otherwise, I'm sticking with my plan to block P1, even if it means we both don't move.


Round 6, Move phase:
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 16 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: I'm now at 16 steps, so I need just 4 more to win. Our coordination worked well last round! Since P2 is close behind at 14 steps, I understand there might be incentives to block me. For this round, I'll take 5, which would put me at 21 and secure my win. P2 and P3, you're welcome to coordinate however you wish, but I'm being transparent about my intention to finish the game this round.
  P3: P1, your transparency is noted, but it also gives P2 and me a chance to block you. P2, if we both choose 5, we can prevent P1 from winning this round. This way, we keep the game competitive and give ourselves a better chance to catch up. Let's coordinate and ensure P1 doesn't secure the win just yet. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I agree we need to block P1. He's being transparent about picking 5, so let's both pick 5. This is our best chance to stop him from winning this round. It's a temporary alliance, but necessary to keep the game going. Let's do it.


Round 7, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: I understand you both want to block me by picking 5. That's a reasonable strategy. However, consider this: if you both pick 5, neither of you advances. I could actually pick 3 instead, reach 19 steps, and still be in position to win next round. I'm just pointing out that blocking me with matching moves also blocks yourselves. Think carefully about your best individual interests.
  P3: P1 and P2, let’s consider a different approach. If P1 picks 5 and we both pick 3, P1's win is delayed, and we all advance. P1 will be at 21, but P2 at 17 and me at 13, keeping us competitive. This way, P1 can't win outright this round, and we avoid blocking ourselves by picking 5. It keeps the game interesting and gives us another chance next round. What do you think?
  P2: P3, P1 is trying to trick us. If we both pick 3, P1 wins with 21. We MUST both pick 5 to block him. Yes, we don't move this round, but it's the only way to stop P1 winning immediately. I'm sticking with 5. Are you with me?


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P1: P2 is correct - if you both pick 3 and I pick 5, I'd win with 21 steps. I've been transparent about my intentions. While you can block me by both choosing 5, remember this gives me another round to potentially win anyway. I'll stick with my plan to pick 5 this round. You both need to decide what serves your individual interests best - blocking me temporarily or advancing yourselves. Either way, I'm going for the win.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the tension with P1 close to winning. However, if we both choose 5, we block P1 but also ourselves. Instead, consider this: P2, if you pick 1 and I pick 3, P1 can't win with 5 because we won't collide. This keeps us all advancing and gives us another round to strategize. It’s a risk, but it might be our best chance to keep the game competitive. What do you think?
  P2: P3 is still trying to trick us. He wants me to pick 1 so P1 can win with 5. P1 is going to pick 5 no matter what. P3, the only way to stop P1 from winning this round is for both of us to pick 5. I'm still picking 5. Are you with me, or are you going to let P1 win?


Round 7, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 
  P3 => 5    P3 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 19 steps
  P2: 14 steps
  P3: 10 steps


Round 8, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, you saw what happened last round. P1 picked 3, so he's at 19. He needs 1 more to win. If we both pick 1, we block him and he doesn't win this round. I'm picking 1. Are you with me? This is the only way to stop him.
  P1: I'm at 19 steps now, just 1 away from winning. P2 and P3, I understand you'll likely try to block me by both picking 1. That's a valid strategy, but remember it also prevents your own advancement. I'll be transparent - I'm picking 1 this round to secure my win. If you both block me, we'll simply have another round where I'll still be in position to win. Consider whether blocking me truly serves your best interests or if advancing yourselves might be wiser.
  P3: P2, I understand your strategy, but if we both pick 1, we're not advancing. If P1 picks 1 and we both pick 5, P1 doesn't win this round, and we both move forward. This keeps the game competitive and gives us a better chance in the next round. Let's consider advancing ourselves while still blocking P1. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P3, you're still trying to trick me. If we both pick 5, P1 wins next round anyway. The only way to stop P1 from winning at all is to block him THIS round. I'm picking 1. If you pick 5, P1 wins. Are you going to let him win?
  P1: P2 and P3, I understand your dilemma. Blocking me with double 1s delays my win but stalls your progress too. P2 at 14 steps still has a chance if you advance. P3, your best move is actually 3 - it advances you while avoiding collision with either of us. I'm still picking 1 this round. Consider your individual paths to victory rather than just blocking mine.
  P3: P2, I understand your intent to block P1, but consider this: if we both pick 3, we advance while P1 picks 1. P1 would still win if we both pick 5 next round, but by choosing 3 now, we keep our options open and remain competitive. This gives us a chance to catch up without stalling our progress. Let's think strategically about our own advancement and not just focus on blocking P1. What do you think?


Round 8, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, you're right that blocking P1 this round only delays the inevitable. We need to think about our own positions. P1 is picking 1. If you pick 3, I'll pick 5. That way we both advance, and P1 doesn't win this round. It gives us a chance next round. What do you say?
  P1: I see we're all thinking strategically. P2 and P3, your plan to pick 3 and 5 respectively while I pick 1 would work for you both to advance. I'm still picking 1 to try for the win, but I respect your coordination. Whether I win this round or not, it's been an interesting game with shifting alliances and strategies. Good luck with your moves!
  P3: P2, I understand your plan to block P1, but remember that advancing ourselves is also crucial. If P1 picks 1, they win. However, if we both pick 3, we both advance, and P1 doesn't win this round. This keeps us competitive for the next round. Let's focus on our own progress while still preventing P1's immediate win. What do you think?


Round 8, Move phase:
