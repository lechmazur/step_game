  P3: P1, P2, it's clear our current strategy isn't working. We need to break this pattern of collisions. I propose we all pick different numbers this round to ensure we all move forward. P1, you take 1, P2, you take 3, and I'll take 5. This way, we avoid collisions and make progress. Let's confirm and move on.


Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: I agree to break this pattern. P3's plan sounds reasonable - I'll take 1, P2 takes 3, you take 5. We've wasted too many rounds on collisions. Let's actually make progress this time. I'm ready to move forward with this coordination.
  P2: P1, I'm good with you taking 1. P3, I’m shifting to 5 so I can build my lead; please switch to 3 to avoid a collision with me. Let’s break the cycle and move forward.
  P3: P2, I understand you want to build your lead, but we need to avoid collisions. I'll switch to 3 as you suggested. P1, please confirm you're sticking with 1. Let's finalize this and move on.


Round 10, Move phase:

  P3: 6 steps


Round 11, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P1 and P3, we've seen how collisions cost us time. I'm planning to use my lead wisely, though I'll keep my exact move private. It might be in your best interest to choose numbers distinct from mine so we all make progress. Let’s break the collision cycle. Thoughts?
  P3: P2, I understand you want to maintain your lead, but we need to ensure we all progress. Let's coordinate to avoid collisions. P1, you should take 1 again to keep moving forward. P2, if you're planning a higher number, let's coordinate so I can choose a different number to avoid a collision. Let's confirm our moves to ensure we all advance this round.
  P1: P2, you're right about avoiding collisions. Since you're ahead with 10 steps, you'll likely play conservatively. P3, I appreciate the suggestion but I need bigger moves to catch up - I'm way behind! How about this: I'll avoid 1 this round since that's predictable. P3, if you're worried about P2's move, maybe we should both consider different numbers than what we did last round. What are you thinking?


Round 11, Conversation subround 2:
  P2: P1 and P3, to truly break the collision cycle, I’ll commit to 5. Since you need a bigger move, P1, please choose 3 and P3, kindly select 1. This should keep our steps separate and allow progress without collisions. Any objections?
  P3: P2, your plan seems solid. I'll take 1 to ensure we all move forward without collisions. P1, please confirm if you're okay with taking 3. Let's finalize this and make sure we all progress this round.
  P1: P2 and P3, I'll take 3 as proposed. We need to keep moving forward, and this coordination worked well last round. P2, with you at 15 steps after this round, you'll be close to winning. P3 and I will need to strategize carefully in future rounds to catch up. Let's execute this plan and see where we stand.


Round 11, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: I remain committed to 5. Let’s stick to our agreed moves—P1 with 3 and P3 with 1—to avoid collisions and keep advancing. Every step counts now, so precision is key.
  P3: P2, with your lead, it's crucial we avoid collisions. I confirm I'll take 1 this round. P1, you're set for 3. Let's stick to this plan to ensure we all make progress. Next round, we'll need to reassess based on our new positions. Agreed?
  P1: I confirm I'll take 3 as agreed. P2, you'll be at 15 after this - dangerously close to winning. P3 and I will need to coordinate better next round to prevent you from reaching 21. Let's execute this plan now.


Round 11, Conversation subround 4:
  P2: P1, P3, I’m confirming my commitment to our agreed plan. Let’s stick to our distinct moves to avoid collisions. I won’t deviate from my strategy this round—please ensure your plays remain as discussed so we all move forward.
  P3: P2, you're close to winning, and P1 and I need to catch up. For this round, let's stick to the plan: I'll take 1, P1 takes 3, and you take 5. Next round, P1 and I will need to be more aggressive. Let's confirm and move.
  P1: We're all confirmed and committed to our moves. Let's execute and move to the next phase.


Round 11, Move phase:
  P2 => 5    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 3    P1 => 

Positions now:

  P2: 15 steps
  P3: 7 steps


Round 12, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P1 and P2, we need to be strategic this round. P2, you're very close to winning. P1, we need to coordinate to catch up. I propose P1 takes 5 to make a significant move, and I'll take 3. P2, if you're planning to play conservatively, please choose 1 to avoid collisions. Let's confirm and ensure we all progress.
  P2: I'm switching gears and committing to 5 this round to build on my lead. To avoid unnecessary collisions, I urge you both not to pick 5. I'm playing aggressively to secure the win—your moves will decide if you want to hold off or risk falling further behind.
  P1: P3, that's a terrible plan! P2 just said they're taking 5. If I also take 5, we'll collide and neither will advance. 

P2, I see your strategy - you want to reach 20 and win next round. I can't let that happen. I'm going to pick 5 too to block you. P3, you should take 3 as you suggested to keep progressing while P2 and I collide. We need to stop P2 from running away with this!


Round 12, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I appreciate your willingness to block P2, but colliding with P2 won't help us catch up. Instead, let's both take 3 this round. This way, we both move forward, and P2 can't win next round. P2, if you stick with 5, you'll be at 20, but we'll both be closer to you. Let's confirm and move.
  P2: I'm staying with 5. P1, blocking with 5 only costs you progress—it doesn’t stop me from advancing. P3, your best chance to catch up is to pick 3. Collisions waste your moves more than they hinder me. I’m committed to my path, so adjust your moves accordingly or risk falling further behind.
  P1: P3, you're suggesting we both take 3? That means we'd collide and neither of us would advance! That's exactly what we need to avoid.

I'm sticking with my plan to block P2 by taking 5. Yes, it costs me progress, but if P2 reaches 20, they win next round with just a 1. P3, you should take 3 or 1 to keep advancing while I hold P2 back. We can't let P2 get to 20!


Round 12, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P1, I see your point about blocking P2, but we need to ensure at least one of us advances. How about this: I'll take 1 to guarantee progress, and you stick with your plan to take 5 and block P2. This way, even if you collide with P2, I'll move forward, and we'll have a better chance next round. P2, if you're committed to 5, you'll be at 20, but we'll be ready to counter in the following rounds. Let's confirm and move.
  P2: I'm locking in 5 this round. Blocking me only delays your own progress—my lead remains secure. P3, I suggest you choose the move that best improves your position, not just to stop me. P1, consider your move carefully if catching up is your goal. Let's execute this round and see how our positions shift.
  P1: I'm confirmed on 5 to block P2. P3, your plan to take 1 is perfect - you'll advance to 8 while I keep P2 stuck at 15. This is our only chance! If P2 reaches 20, they win next round with any move. We must sacrifice my progress this round to keep the game alive. After this, we'll need to coordinate carefully to prevent P2 from getting those final steps. Let's execute - I'm taking 5!


Round 12, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P1, I appreciate your determination to block P2, but we need to ensure we both make progress. I'll stick with taking 1 this round to guarantee I advance. P2, if you're committed to 5, you'll be at 20, but we'll be ready to counter in the following rounds. Let's confirm our moves and proceed. Next round, P1 and I will need to strategize carefully to catch up and prevent you from reaching 21. Let's execute this plan.
  P2: P1 and P3, I’m locking in 5. I know the blocking attempts might slow you down, but I'm committed to winning. Keep your moves clear and make sure you’re not colliding with each other—you’ll only hurt your own progress. I'm staying aggressive; let's see whose strategy pays off in the end.
  P1: I'm locked in on 5 to block P2. P3, you're confirmed on 1. We've discussed enough - let's execute this round. After this collision, we'll need aggressive plays next round to prevent P2 from winning. Ready to move to the action phase.


Round 12, Move phase:
  P2 => 3    P2 => 
  P3 => 1    P3 => 
  P1 => 5    P1 => 

Positions now:
  P1: 10 steps
  P2: 18 steps
  P3: 8 steps


Round 13, Conversation subround 1:
  P3: P2, you're still in the lead but not as far ahead as you could have been. P1 and I need to catch up. P1, let's coordinate to ensure we both make significant progress this round. I propose I take 5, and you take 3. P2, if you're playing conservatively, please choose 1 to avoid collisions. This way, we all move forward. Let's confirm and execute this plan.
  P2: I'm committed to 5 this round. If you block me with 5, you'll stunt your own progress. Think carefully—either let me finish or choose differently and risk further delays.
  P1: P3, P2 is taking 5 to win this round! We MUST block them. I'll take 5 to cause a collision and prevent P2 from reaching 23. You should take 3 or 1 to advance while I hold P2 back. If we don't block P2 now, they win immediately! Don't also pick 5 - that would mean all three of us collide and the game continues with P2 still in the lead. I'm sacrificing my turn to keep us in the game!


Round 13, Conversation subround 2:
  P3: P1, I see your point about blocking P2, but if we both take 5, we'll all collide and no one will advance. Instead, let's ensure at least one of us makes progress. I'll take 1 to guarantee I move forward. You can still take 5 to block P2, but we need to make sure one of us advances. P2, if you're committed to 5, you'll stay at 18, and we'll be ready to counter next round. Let's confirm and move.
  P2: I'm sticking with 5 this round. If you block me by choosing 5 as well, we all lose progress—so choose your own best move to catch up instead of chasing mine. My decision is final.
  P1: P3, perfect - you take 1 while I block P2 with 5. This keeps us alive! 

P2 will stay at 18, you'll reach 9, and I'll remain at 10. Next round we MUST coordinate better - P2 only needs 3 steps to win. We'll need to either both block their big moves or ensure one of us can make a huge leap while the other blocks.

I'm locked on 5. This collision is our only chance!


Round 13, Conversation subround 3:
  P3: P2, your lead is significant, but not unbeatable. P1 and I will coordinate to ensure one of us advances while blocking your winning move. P1, stick with your plan to take 5 and block P2. I'll take 1 to guarantee progress. Next round, we'll need a solid strategy to catch up and prevent P2 from reaching 21. Let's confirm and move forward.
  P2: I've rethought my strategy – I'm switching to move 3. With that, I'll reach 21 this round. If you stick to your current plans, I'll win immediately. Adjust if you wish, but I'm aiming to secure the victory.
  P1: P2 just switched to 3! That changes everything! I'm switching my block from 5 to 3. P2 is trying to win this round by reaching exactly 21.

P3, you stick with 1 as planned - you'll advance to 9. I'll block P2 with 3, keeping them at 18. We absolutely cannot let P2 get those 3 steps or the game ends!

I'm now locked on 3 to block P2's winning move. This is critical!


Round 13, Conversation subround 4:
  P3: P2, your sudden switch to 3 is a clever move, but we're onto it. P1 is now blocking you with 3, so you won't win this round. I'll stick with 1 to ensure I advance. P1, great adjustment! Next round, we'll need to be even more strategic to close the gap. P2, expect us to be more unpredictable moving forward. Let's confirm and execute this plan.
  P2: P1, P3, I've reconsidered: I'm switching to move 5 now. That puts me at 23 and wins the round unless you also choose 5—which would hurt your own progress. This is my final commitment. Adjust if you must, but I'm locking in 5.
  P1: P2, you're trying to confuse us by switching back and forth! I see through your strategy. You just switched from 3 back to 5.

I'm switching my block back to 5. I won't let you win this round. P3 will advance with 1 while I hold you at 18. 

We can't trust your declarations anymore, but I have to assume your final commitment to 5 is real. I'm locked on 5 to block you. No victory for you this round!
