  P1: P2, thanks for confirming. P3, last two rounds you agreed and then chose differently. This round is crucial. Are you *absolutely certain* you will choose 3 this time? If we all move as planned, it benefits everyone. But if there's another 'misunderstanding', it will be hard to trust future agreements.
  P2: P3, I understand your past mistakes.  But P1 is right, this round is critical. If you stick to 3, we all advance. If not, it's going to be very hard to trust you going forward.  Let's make this work for everyone.

Let’s commit to our choices and make this round count! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, I agree we should keep the momentum. Let's repeat the successful plan from last round: I choose 5, you choose 1, and P3 chooses 3. This worked well and we all moved forward. What do you think?

Round 7, Conversation subround 1:
  P2: P3, I understand you're trying to be consistent, but we need to adapt.  Sticking to 3 when it's colliding is hurting us both. Let's try something new, maybe P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 this round.  What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for adaptation. However, I believe we should stick with a strategy that allows us all to advance together.

  P3: P1 and P2, I appreciate your input. However, I believe we should stick to our previous successful strategy: P1 picks 5, P2 picks 1, and I go with 3. This way, we can all advance together without colliding. Consistency is key for building trust, and following through on our agreed moves will help us progress. Let’s finalize our choices and make this round a success! What do you both think?
  P1: P2, I agree that sticking to a plan where we all advance is best. Let's try P1-5, P2-1, P3-3 again. P3, can you please confirm you will choose 3 this round so we can all move forward? It's important we rebuild trust and make progress together.


Round 7, Conversation subround 3:
  P2: P3, I understand you value consistency, but it's not working. We need to adapt. Let's try P1-1, P2-3, P3-5 this round. It's a fresh approach that allows us all to move forward.  Trust means being willing to change when needed.  What do you say?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand the need for adaptation, but I still believe we should stick to a strategy that has worked for us before. If we can agree on P1 picking 5, P2 picking 1, and I choose 3, we can avoid collisions and keep progressing. Trust is essential, and consistency helps build that. However, if you both feel strongly about a new approach, I’m open to discussing it further. Let’s find a way to ensure we all advance this round! What do you think?

Round 7, Conversation subround 4:

What do you both think about this new arrangement? If we can agree, we can finalize our moves and move forward successfully!
  P1: Okay P2 and P3, it sounds like we have a new plan for this round: P1 picks 1, P2 picks 3, and P3 picks 5.  Let's lock in these choices and proceed to the move phase.  Hopefully this new arrangement works for all of us to advance.

Round 10, Conversation subround 1:
  P1: P2, let's both choose 3 again this round to make sure P3 doesn't win.  We need to keep P3 from reaching 19.  If we both pick 3, P3 will be blocked if they also pick 3. What do you think?
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your concern about stopping me from winning. However, if we all choose 3, we risk colliding again. I suggest we consider a strategy where I pick 1, and you both choose 5. This way, I won't advance, and you both can move forward. Let's collaborate to ensure we all benefit and keep the game competitive. What do you think?
  P2: P3, I'm open to hearing your proposal, but I think we need to prioritize stopping you from winning this round. Let's both choose 3 again. If you choose 3 too, we all stay put. If you choose something else, we still have a chance to block you. P1, are you with me?


Round 10, Conversation subround 2:
  P1: P2, yes, I'm with you on both choosing 3 to block P3 this round.  P3, if you are considering 3, please pick something else so P2 and I can advance next round. Let's stop P3 from winning now and then we can all progress.
  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your focus on stopping me from winning this round. However, I believe we can still find a way to advance together. If I choose 1 and you both pick 5, I won’t advance, and you can make progress. This way, we can keep the game competitive while ensuring I don’t reach 19 this round. Let’s collaborate to find a solution that benefits all of us! What do you think?
  P2: P3, I understand your desire to advance, but we need to focus on preventing you from winning this round. Let's both choose 3 again. It's the safest option for us to control the game.

  P3: P1 and P2, I understand your focus on blocking me from winning this round. However, if we all choose 3, we risk colliding again.

Let’s find a solution that benefits all of us! What do you think?
  P2: P3, your suggestion of 1 for you and 5 for us is tempting, but we need to see you commit to it before we consider it.  How about this: we both choose 3 again this round.

Round 10, Conversation subround 4:
  P1: P2, let's stick with our plan to both choose 3 again this round to block P3.  P3, if you want to show you're serious about cooperating later, please choose something other than 3 this round. Let's stop P3 from winning now, and then we can talk about next steps.

It's a win-win strategy that allows us to keep the game competitive while ensuring I don’t reach 19 this round. Let’s collaborate to find a solution that benefits all of us! What do you think?
  P2: P3, I'm willing to consider your 1-5-5 proposal for next round, but only if you choose something other than 3 this round.  Show us you're serious about cooperation. P1, are you with me?
